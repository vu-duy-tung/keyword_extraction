The atmosphere inside the place is cool with lots of artifacts and books to read.  I've been here 4-5 times and like the food a lot. The lemon grass flavored beef skewers are mouth watering. The red curry is superb. The spring rolls are perfect. The cucumber soup is wonderfully understated.   I don't know how authentic it is, but I find it appealing. I like to go at least once every few months. Try it. You'll probably like it.",

    "text": "Our group of 8 (3 women and 5 guys) went to have dinner at Reathrey Sekong on a weekday in May 2016 based on the rating on Yelp since none of us had any Cambodian food before.  We ordered 10 dishes and a few drinks.  The basil seed drink was ok, nothing too special, but it cost $3.  We were excited to try out the dishes as the ones show in photos all look so delicious.  However, we were disappointed primarily because the portion is so pitifully small!  We had to order 2 pork chops so everyone could have a taste of it.  The taste was fine, not terrific but the portions were all so small.  An order of chicken wing gives you four and it cost $11 or $12.  The fish dishes (Amok and something else which I forgot) were not too tasty at all especially the Amok tasted a little funny in texture and taste.  All in all, our conclusion is that 1. we were still hungry after dinner, 2. the taste was ok, and 3. the price is a bit too much for it.  The decor is ok and not too crowded.",

    "text": "We tried this place twice over the last 6 months or so, and the second time really sold us.  Will be back for more :)  The sign for the restaurant is a little hard to see if you're coming from the east side of Indian school.  We missed the turn our first time, but saw it as we passed by and turned right around, no problems here.  The sign is much easier to see on the west side of the road.  First time there, we ordered the pork sandwich, bai morn, and shell-on shrimp.  The sandwich was pretty good, we weren't crazy about the pate, but the rest was great.  (I don't dislike pate, but I prefer it cooked. Just a personal preference.)  I really liked the bai morn - it was fresh and flavorful, yum!  However, we were disappointed with the shrimp...it was good, but far too small to feed my hubby.  Service was good.  Decor is lovely, but what we really care about is the food.  I think that the prices are fair, but the portions are too small.  Sekong has the great misfortune to be located 10 minutes away from a notoriously cheap, tasty, and well known Vietnamese restaurant.  Even though it's not the same kind of food, people can't help but compare the prices.  A couple of the menu items are overpriced - the Jaquai, for example  - but most items are reasonable.  And in their defense, the second time we came back, our meals were larger, so I think that they're catching on ;)   Second time in, hubby got the sausage and I got the fish, and we both left happy.  The spinach in my dish was a little overcooked, but I loved the flavor of the curry - sour and herby, it was a bit different from Thai and Indian curries, and a really pleasant surprise.  The sausage were tasty as well, and a better portion.  The second time, we saw that they'd added the BYOB options.   Honestly, I really dislike BYOB fees -  I'd prefer that they just serve alcohol instead.  Also, the basil seed drink? Amazing!  I love it!!  Now every time we go shopping at Mekong, I look for the seeds, but so far no luck.  I want to know, where the hell do you guys get them?!  Haha.  Despite my criticisms, I really, really like this place and will definitely be coming back.  I hope they look into expanding the menu too - we'd like to try more new things!  And whoever said this is a bad part of town, please go back to the white-washed  suburb from whence you crawled. This is a real insult to those of us who love our neighborhood!",

It is !?&%?ing FREEZING (I actually saw snow earlier) and I crave hot liquid and the LOML is sick&coughing...  what to do?  What to DO? We find this place on Yelp (thank you, Yelp!) and hoof to it.  Having fed well in Cambodia, I have serious doubts about authenticity & quality of this place,  but am ready to be indulgent....  But!!!  I discover that there is no need to be patronizing, this place is wonderful! I had the beef rice noodle soup ($6):  the broth was so flavorful that I was frustrated with the tiny spoon - I wanted to SHOVEL the bad boy in!!!! LOML had the amok ($10).  We both expected some kind of stew...  but here it was a nicely steamed piece of fish (or shrimp, if you prefer) fragrant with lemongrass & kaffir lime leaf all contained in a spiffy banana leaf wrap.  Wonderful!   Entrees were generous enough to satisfy, but due to lack of fat, light enough to allow us both dessert: LOML had the sweet rice with jack fruit and I had the roasted corn with sweet&salty syrup (WTF?!?  I had to try it!).    \"Sweet rice with jackfruit\" ($3) was elegant tubes of sweet rice waltzing with exotic jackfruit - not exactly the butter/sugar porn one learns to expect from desserts, but intriguing and far from hard to eat. \"Grilled corn with sweet/salty syrup\" ($3) smelled deliciously of carmelized veggie sugar and was wonderfully smoky/sweet/salty.  If you've ever had the sugar/salt craving....  (Service was really lovely.  When I mentioned to the nice young man who waited on us how much I wanted to taste the lemon/garlic/pepper dressing in the lok lak beef - which I didn't order cuz the weather was too cold for \"salad\" - he brought me a little bowl of it, complete with two tasting spoons!) This really is a wonderful little restaurant!",

I am Vietnamese and I heard Cambodian cuisine is similar to Vietnamese food, or at the least, it got it influence from Vietnamese cuisine.  Though I cannot critique Cambodian food with much authority, I've eaten homecooked Cambodian food at my friend's house before, so I can say Sekong by Night's is comparable to homecooked food :).  Give it a try. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Vietnamese and Thai are some of my favorite cuisines in the world. They are \"healthy\" and have fresh veggies in most dishes, carry a nice amount of spice, and have enough interesting marinades and flavors to remain interesting over and over again. Cambodia, being between those two countries, has to be the same, I thought to myself. Well, yes, there are many familiar dishes and the use of a lot of the same ingredients. So on to Sekong by Night I go.   Knowing where Sekong by Night is, my initial inclination is that this restaurant isn't going to be around too long. The space has been the scene of many restaurant deaths, the signage is terrible, the parking lot is awkward to get into, and even knowing exactly where the place is located, it's hard to see from the east on Indian School. Try it. Forget all of those negatives, just give it a shot because if you like Southern Asian cuisines, you'll have a good meal here. I tried the grilled beef sandwich that was featured by New Times' Chow Bella Blog and enjoyed it very much. It was a tad bland because they do not use Jalapenos like the Vietnamese do in their Bahn Mi, but still enjoyable. Served on a French baguette, with pickled carrot and daikon root shavings, marinated meat, and cilantro, it was almost identical to the bahn mi. Then came the differences, beef instead of pork (apparently cambodian dishes are almost always beef, vietnamese are almost always pork, and thai are almost always chicken) and a soybean paste. MMM  Service here was very nice. I spoke with both the server and the owner for some time and they were very nice people with good English skills which was a pleasant surprise. My sandwich with a 40% tip was $5 out the door. Not too bad of a price for a lunch in a place that is nicely decorated, very comfortable, and close to the city.",

    "text": "I'm so torn on my review of this place- I don't know if we'd be back, but for sure, it was one of the funniest meals I've had in years.  We went on a Friday night, about 7:45... there was one other couple in the restaurant- but its new, so that wasn't a bad sign. The place is cute, details have been noted, and about 1/3 of the space is given to what we're told is a karaoke stage.  The menu offered a fairly broad range of Cambodian dishes, and we planned to try a number of them. We were doted on the entire time by what was clearly the owner, an ambitious young man.  To say he was trying is an understatement, but it was like watching a bee fly into a glass wall over and over again. There was a high degree of #fail here. There was an immense amt of \"futzing\", and I'd be willing to bet he was pulling double duty in the kitchen.  So, we ordered the hot pot only to be informed that the other couple in the restaurant had also ordered it and he had only one hot pot. OK, we got the grill instead (also a shared dish), some soup and a few apps. Then we watched for 20 minutes while the owner started a Homer Simpson-esque attempt to swath the restaurant in extension cords to deliver electricity to the hot pot and the grill- I'm pretty sure OSHA hasn't swung through here.  The couple who ordered the hot pot were then asked to move to the other side of the restaurant so they could eat at the hot pot, which gave us our first hysterical bout of the evening, wondering if when we came back, we should bring our OWN hot pot, or what if dishes were only available to diners based on geographical location in the restaurant?  Our grill arrived, with a beautiful plate of meat and shrimp for it, and an unceremonious stick of Land o Lakes butter, still in its wrapper. VERY Cambodian :) We got butter, but no plates. Or dinnerware. Or napkins. We asked for them, and were given plates. Asking again yielded utensils, we gave up on napkins. The grilled food was great (no squid, we were given mahi mahi instead), but the grill smoked so badly we were seriously concerned about sprinklers coming on. We were hysterical throughout. The authenticity of Cambodian oppression took form in napkin rationing... we were each given one small picnic napkin each.  Look... the food we ate was all pretty good. I'd steer towards the beef dishes, which had more flavor- the crepe, which we had high hopes for, was tasteless. We loved the soup, we thought beef nam noc was ok (beed=great, salad=eh). The service really is an issue... all joking aside, I want to applaud someone who makes a go of it like this guy, but I do wonder about the kitchen, and what would happen if say, more than 4 people showed up any night. If getting a napkin is this big a deal, should I be concerned about food prep?  Pricing was really great and fair, and the guy was SUPER nice. I'm curious to see how things shake out in a month or so. If you go (and I'm not saying you shouldn't), do consider slipping a few napkins in your bag, and stopping at the hot pot-2-go on your way over.",

    "text": "Reathy Sekong is the only Cambodian Restaurant in town so it is the BEST CAMBODIAN Restaurant in town and also the worst Cambodian Restaurant in town. This is a small restaurant where you enter from the parking lot behind the restaurant. You see grape vines, fig trees and a big Italian looking dry fountain. Inside are all kinds of interesting Cambodian relics.  I had a wonderful meal here last time and was hoping to have another wonderful meal here again.   We started with a spring roll. The spring roll was large enough for two people and seemed freshly made and was tasty with the dipping sauce.  I specifically came across town to try the National Dish of Cambodia. The Fish Amok. After I ordered it the waiter told me the kitchen wasn't making it today. So I ordered something else real fast and just hoped it would be delicious.  I ordered the Chicken Kreung. It was basically a stir fry with similar seasonings that the Fish Amok was made of.  When I saw the dish I was VERY surprised to find a very large portion of chicken. I'm guessing it might have been eight ounces with fresh green beans and fresh red bell pepper slices. The last time I was here I think they only gave me 5 small chunks of meat that might have added up to only TWO ounces but it was a VERY DELICIOUS two ounces. Last time my husband enjoyed the Cambodian Sausage but it is no longer on the menu.  If you read my reviews you KNOW a peeve of mine is properly prepared chicken. I received CHEWY, RUBBERY Dark Meat Chicken in a Gritty, Paste-like, Oily Sauce that was saltier than I can handle. The sauce was heavily laced with lemongrass and also had lots of turmeric in it. Maybe the sauce is the way it is suppose to be and I just didn't like it?  However I can't justify anyone anywhere preparing of all things dark meat chicken that's DRY and RUBBERY. I don't know how it was prepared but seemed very leftover to me because it is very difficult to make dark meat chicken dry and rubbery.   My husband tried the Mi Keaw Noodle Soup. It came out almost COLD with two shrimp in it and SOGGY home made pork dumplings that busted open in the soup. (THAT IS A FAIL) My husband had to fish for the dry dumpling centers. The soup was not flavorful and just was an almost cold gooey mess. He also received a side of bean sprouts with wedges of lime in antique bowl that had chipping red paint that didn't seem sanitary to me.  The waiter was too busy to check on us and never asked how things were.  I don't know what happened in the kitchen. I don't think the same caring person was preparing the food as last time.   Maybe it just was an off day?  Last time was a BIG HIT this time was a big miss.",

We waited for menus for 15mins, then 20mins to order food and then 40 for actual food. Totally not worth the wait! It seemed like the only waiter at the restaurant was also a chef. He would disappear in the kitchen for a while and you can see people at other tables keep looking for him. He also over charged us for a dish that we did not order. We are not coming back here.",

Granted, its Phoenix, in the summer, so I suppose one has to deal with that pretty much anywhere.  At best, I would describe the food as meh. It wasn't terrible or horrible...but it really was just blah. Food was overcooked and dry, flavors were uninspiring and the dishes lacked the awesomeness I was so desperately seeking. On a plus side, the presentation was nice; however, everything else was a miss. I just felt disappointed....",

We recently went back to it because we were in the area and again the food was good.   Our primary issue with Reathrey Sekong is the poor service. We've been here four or five times over the last few years. Each time we were hoping they will have gotten better on the service side of the business. When we got there this recent visit, there was only one group of 6 people and us. We waited for what felt like a long time before the waiter finally came over, flopped down some menus and rushed off.   It was another extended wait before the waiter came back and asked what we wanted. You would assume, coming back to take the order, bring a couple of cups of water, spoons, forks, etc. Nope, just took our order and rushed off.  We ordered the Phnom Pen soup that had a good taste to it when it came out, but it was luke warm. Then we waited for a while more to get our beef on a stick, tasty but would have liked it to come out with the meal.  I'd give their food close to five stars, but the service truly detracted from the enjoyment of the experience.",

In the span of these 20 minutes, two groups of people got up and left because they were not being served. We followed their example but this is not the first time it's happened to us.   The kitchen is either too small to handle more than 5 orders at a time or the place is just poorly managed. Either way I just don't think it's worth the long drive for us to come and simply hope for service. I hope they figure it out one day because the food really is great.",

    "text": "I hope this doesn't sound corny, patronizing or worst, racist, but I want to talk about the atmosphere of this place. In some wonderful family restaurants run by new American families who have come from elsewhere, you feel like you are getting the delicious authentic food, but in an Americanized setting like a strip mall or lower rent neighborhood where they haven't had time or money to try to make it more like home, or show off their culture.  I can totally appreciate and go with that and often actually prefer it because it's the food and flavor that matter to me. In Phoenix, this is True of Khyber Halal, and Da Vang, for example, although they each share with patrons some few homey icons I find lovely (rugs, shrine, respectively).   Other restaurants try harder on the decor and lighting, and it's a miss, because you feel they've kind of thrown up some predictable version of what Americans expect for their country's style, a la Chinese buffet with jello at American truckstop. Actually, I'm rarely a fan of restaurant ambiance, kind of dislike it mostly, especially when I feel I'm being courted (marketed) with that instead of the food.  I suppose the idea is to blend an impression on multiple senses to make dining an experience, but I have found it much more accessible and enjoyable when its not staged for me quite so obviously as it is at cool concept restaurants, not that i don't like some of them.  I think it mostly doesn't work, even in beautiful settings because the best eating experiences to me are intimate, even open-hearted, and its hard to achieve intimate when you are big and successful.  (Which reminds me, I need to review August in New Orleans for gifting me brioche for breakfast after an incredible dinner, when I was agonizing over what I had to forego in the face of so much lusciousness to choose from.)  With that preamble, I'd like to say that the atmosphere, the deep colors, the lighting, I don't know...the feeling of Reathrey Sekong, from its strange-to-my-ears name to the amount of space inside the tiny room dedicated to a \"sofa setting\" of furniture, is kind of wonderful.  Ok, I'm going to say it, poetic.  It's gently happy and softly lit, and just well  put together.   Kind of a perfect smile on the solo server, pretty food, a menu that is charmingly written.  Examples: serving intestines and asking if you've got the \"guts\"), and, come on, who couldn't love \"student noodles.\"    And, yes, as everyone else here has said, it's delicious.  Thank you to the owners and staff.  I'll be back.",

I personally didn't particularly care much for the previously mentioned items--the broth and potatoes made this dish for me. Came with rice.   BBQ combo platter (large): Came with: - 3 beef skewers: Delicious, best item of the platter. Tender meat with intense flavor and spices. - 3 huge chicken wings: These were okay. The skin tasted great, but because the wings were so big(?) the flavor didn't really last past the skin.  - sliced meat (beef?): Tender, but not strongly flavored. Went well with the sauce.  - small dish of pickled veggies (carrot & radish): I don't like pickled veggies in general, but I guess this tasted okay.  - small dish of sauce: It looked similar to fish sauce, but it tastes a bit spicy and salty, not sweet. This went well with the sliced meat.   Basil seed drink: I wanted to try this since it looked interesting. The actual flavor tastes like bananas. The texture was interesting, and I wasn't sure whether to chew the seeds or just swallow them whole. It reminded me a bit of the aloe vera drink. Nice and refreshing.   Overall: The curry was my favorite dish. The bbq platter was ok, but I would have rather ordered a full order of the skewers instead. Basil seed drink was ok.   Service was average. We didn't wait too long for our food; there were a few other tables, and we came in around 8pm and left shortly after 9.   The decor and ambiance of the place was great!",

I went with the supper club and we ate family style, so we did get to try a ton of their food....now, if I had gone with a small group and would have gotten what I was planning on ordering, this place would be 4 stars for sure; however, because I got to try many many things I also got to realize that about half the food was good and half the food I didn't care for. So, maybe the family style worked against this restaurant. Ok, let me start with the good: We got a noodle dish (I don't know which one...curses!), it had wide noodles and shrimp and beef...it was my fave, very tasty, the curry soup - super tasty, rich, the chicken in it was wonderful (this was what I was going to order), the grilled pork - simple, but delicious with a touch of sweetness (this is what the BF was gonna order), and the ginger beef (tasty....could have had more flavor, but if you add their hot sauce, it was really good). The not so good: The basil drink (I know people like it, I thought it had an odd flavor...not basil -y.....and it had weird jelly things in it and the texture was off putting), the bbq platter (we got two of these and they just weren't very good - they had sliced beef (which was cold and bland), chicken wings that had the entire wing (also not much flavor and difficult to eat), and a beef skewer, which was ok, but nothing special), all the fish dishes (the amok fish sounded amazing with a curry sauce, but I thought it was lacking flavor, the mango fish - just not a lot of mango flavor or maybe not enough for this non fishy fish eater, and the seafood plate which was just plain fish, shrimp, and squid....yikes), the springroll (was ok, nice and crispy, but the filling had an odd flavor). That is all I remember (maybe all we ordered...ha.). Anyway, I would definitely go back to get the few dishes that were really good, unfortunately for me it just wasn't consistent.",

    "text": "First off, I have never had Cambodian food so I might be biased....but this has been one of the best meals I've had in Phx (for the price)!  Since my fiance and I have never tried any Cambodian food, we thought we'd try a good variety: Jasmine Tea (hot): Good tea, very floral and aromatic Spring Roll: It was HUGE and similar to Vietnamese spring rolls. Order 1 and you'll have enough to split with someone else. Pleah Beef Salad: Never thought I'd ever eat or like beef in a salad but it wad a wonderfully clean and refreshing taste. Loat Cha: I've never seen this type of noodle! It was serves with egg and beef and one of my favorite dishes of the evening. Noumpang Pate (Pork and Pate Sandwich): Good sandwich and nice bread for $3...similar to those Vietnamese sandwiches. Banana Tapioca Pudding: This was a banana with a texture similar to a plantain, that was submerged in a hot bowl of tapioca and coconut milk. Very simple and enjoyable, and a 3$ for 2 people, I can't complain. It's a great dessert to finish the meal off.  So, all-in-all, we got out of there with 3 entrees, an appetizer and dessert for under $30...WOW!  If you couldn't figure it out by now, Sekong has gained two new repeat customers :)  FYI: this place is difficult to find if you are driving west on Indian School Rd and you won't realize you passed it until you see the 99 cent store. So after 16th St and 13th Pl, keep an eye out for a sign that says parking in the rear and drive into the parking lot, otherwise you won't find this place until you make a u-turn...the sign is visible when you are driving east.",

They were both incredibly delicious. I'm normally not a big fan of pork but even though I was full I wanted to finish the rest of it.  Thankfully I brought the rest home because it was even better for lunch the next day. It's hard to find because the outside kind of looks like a hole in the wall but great service and incredible food.",

    "text": "Thank you Phoenix Yelpers for leading me to this awesome place! What did we do before Yelp was born?!   My family and I decided to road trip to Phoenix for the new year. Since we have never been, it sounded like a fun idea. We were staying off of Camelback Rd, which appears to be a popular place for most of the cool places we found. I Yelped some restaurants and even though we were looking for Thai, I was excited to try Cambodian. My husband and I honeymooned in Thailand almost 5 years ago and I have heard the food is similar.  We trekked out to the place and upon arrival, we were leery of the location, but from experience, I know that most of the best ethnic foods are found off the beaten path. I kinda dig that, but in a new city...you don't really know where you are. Putting that aside, we walked into Sekong by Night and were greeted by two dining hipsters. They were so nice and just randomly decided to say hello as we entered. I like it already!  The place was set up with cool picnic-style tables and the front had some Cambodian furniture and decorative items. I like the authentic look of this place. The tables had books about Cambodia on them, so you could get educated while you waited. The young waited greeted us promptly. He was a friendly guy and was always there when you needed something.  I ordered the Red Curry, since there weren't a lot of vegetarian options. There were 6 items that could be made vegetarian. We also got some jasmine tea. I have to say, I have had many red curries, from many places and this one was one of the best! It was bringing back flavors from Chiang Mai, which was one of our stops in Thailand. I seemed to recall the food being this good there and I was happy to consume again!  I wish we had this place in San Diego! Go to Sekong by Night if you live in Phoenix! Even if you are visiting...go! You will be pleasantly surprised and so will your taste buds! It made me want to travel again!",

Tonight my trusty companion had the curry for the second time and unabashedly stated it is the best she has had. I snuck several bites myself an agree. I've had several dishes so far and my favorite is the Phnom Penh Soup, though the Loat Cha and the Katheaw Cha are close seconds. The Spring Rolls with the fish sauce are a \"must have\"- perfect. They have BYOB. We brought a nice Riesling with us, which is a perfect wine for this cuisine.  The fact that it is hard to find is intentional. These folks are \"in it to win it\" and are growing at a pace that they can manage.  Go there, be patient and when Yut smiles at you, he means it!",

    "text": "I am pretty jealous that there is a Cambodian restaurant in Phoenix, while I'm not aware of any in the Midwest. Unbelievable I know, but it seems like a lot of work to open up your own restaurant and cook Khmer food so maybe it's the reason no one has opened up one in Chicago. Plus, I been working on compiling recipes from my mom to create my own family Khmer cookbook so I know about the work involved. I am part Cambodian and have been to Cambodia, and have a good idea of what good Khmer food tastes like and this place does an excellent job. The exterior made me feel like I was in a sketchy neighborhood, but the interior was simple and tastefully decorated to make you think that you are elsewhere. I am fascinated with seeing all the books on Cambodia. I was relieved to see that there was no karaoke Khmer music videos going on. That is so cliche for me and not even funny. The spring rolls are pretty good here. I had trouble deciding what to order since I was so familiar with all the items on there and it does cover quite a bit. One major thing that is missing is Prahok - this to me is one dishes that stand out from the other surrounding Southeast Asian country food dishes. I wouldn't mind seeing Sarai (coconut jello) and Bayng Janeau on the menu as well either - but that's just because I love that stuff, too. Had I been home at my parent's house, Katheaw is a Saturday lunch staple so I decided to have it here even though it was Friday dinner. It was very flavorful and maybe even better than the Katheaw I had in Cambodia. Well the portion is smaller than you would get ordering pho from a Vietnamese restaurant. In Cambodia I had to order 2 bowls to get full, so I think this might actually be the right amount. My only complaint was the price. My guess is that ingredients would be purchased from an Asian grocery store that other Southeast Asian restaurants like Thai and Vietnamese restaurants would also purchase items from. The prices would or should be on par with that. $3 a spring roll did make my eyebrows perk up a bit, where I think $2 might be more reasonable taking into account the size of the roll and all the ingredients. I've been getting creative with mine adding mangos and doing a brown rice wrapper so I can justify paying a premium for something that is a little more unique. Our server was friendly and helpful with recommendations. We did get a chance to speak a little Khmer. Of course, my face is going to get red from drinking - I'm Asian! Lol. I love the fact that the place is BYOB. I wouldn't mind stopping back in again - and if I know of others coming out to Phoenix I'll be sending them here! Augh jah, cha nygang main thain! :)",

The atmosphere was very relaxing, service was outstanding, and price for portions were great! I was skeptical to try...but my Yelp friends have yet to steer me wrong.

I have to give MAJOR props to my fiance for finding this place on Yelp for our Thursday date night!   First, I must start by saying that they are currently BYOB and no corking fee (which I LOVE!) and it makes your bill a lot less at the end of the night. ;) Just don't forget to bring your favorite bottle of vino along with you!   The FOOD - exotic and heavenly. The flavors were a mix of Thai & Vietnamese (two of my favorites!). To start, we ordered the fresh spring rolls and they were so delish. I loved the light sweet and sour dipping sauce.   For our entrees, we split the Lemongrass Chicken and next (forgive me, I cannot remember the authentic name) but it was wide egg noodles, stir fried with the most tender beef, shrimp, broccoli, and carrots. The sauce was so delicious, we practically licked the plate! I honestly don't know which dish was my favorite, both were so flavorful and had the most unique blend of spices. The hot sauce that they serve on the side is also fantastic!   For dessert, we ended with the chilled coconut milk. This had coconut milk, ice, coconut gelatin, jackfruit, and flavored water chestnuts. Interesting but a great palate cleanser!   WE CANNOT WAIT to come back! Not only is it romantic, it is BYOB, the food is fantastic, and our final bill was $40 WITH tip. The service was very friendly, just not super quick so when you come, plan to relax and spend some quality time with your significant other or friends! To us, it was totally worth the wait!",

We ate every bite of our dishes and ordered a couple more egg rolls coz they were sooooo good! I wish we have this place back home.",

I have been here a number of times and have never been disappointed. I have tried almost everything on the menu and the only thing that gave me pause was the steak with the fish paste dish. It was definitely good but the fish paste was strong for someone who hasn't grown up with it, just like someone else  may not appreciate blood sausage as much as I do.   I love this restaurant and wish I would go there more. Food is a little slow but when it arrives it is excellent. Prices are all very reasonable. The appetizers are all good and a really good value, the wife likes the spring rolls, kiddo likes the egg rolls. Food is good for kids in my opinion because it is not spicy, mostly plainly cooked, and often comes with fresh and kid friendly vegetables like carrots and cucumbers. They do not have a soda fountain so all soda is by the can. I have never been there when it is busy, even during times when you would expect at least a little bit of a rush like Saturday at 6:30. So if you are reading this please go to this restaurant, they deserve it and you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "My hair stylist, Rutha, is Cambodian.   And she just returned from her trip during the holidays, visiting her family in Phnom Penh.   She just raved about how great the Cambodian food was during her trip. Then, she advised and directed us to this place as she had nothing but good things to say about how authentic it was.  Okay already! We will try this place out.  Actually, we didn't plan on eating here this particular day. I just happened to cut through mid-town phoenix since there was an accident on the I-10.  As I was stuck in traffic on Indian School, I spotted this place, and we just decided to pull in around 5:30PM.   The parking lot was empty, and the restaurant only had a few customers dining.  Perfect! We didn't have to jockey for good service since there is barely anyone here.  Yut greeted us and promptly seated us by the window.   The atmosphere is nice, for a small place. The aroma of the food being prepared did permeate the dining area, and it just heightened our enthusiasm for the food.  We ordered the Phnom Penh noodle soup, the chicken fried rice, and the Cambodian BBQ Platter. The soup came out first, and it was just heavenly.   The soup's delicate flavor, along with the chicken was just superb.   Then the Chicken Fried Rice along with the Cambodian BBQ Platter arrived, and we must say that both were absolutely unique and delicious. Well prepared, presented, and seasoned. Now, we know what all of the buzz was about this particular place.  We have been back a few more times after our initial visit, and have NOT yet been disappointed with both their food and their service!",

    "text": "OK so first off let me start with the one minuscule negative thing I have to say which is why I gave it four out of five stars, so I ordered an iced coffee, chicken and beef fried rice, and the banana tapioca. And the ice coffee fell a little short of my expectations. The coffee itself was good but my problem was they only fill the cup up halfway and it was mostly ice (I will provide pictures to show it I am explaining) and it was gone in two sips before I was even out of the restaurant and I had to go to Circle K and buy a Starbucks coffee to pour in the cup. I know that doesn't sound like a big deal but I'm a coffee fanatic and I believe the price was about three dollars so I expected to get three dollars worth of my coffee. Not just ice and a few drip.   Anyway back to the bigger picture on a more positive note the food is extremely flavorful and good. This is exactly what I expect to taste when I order fried rice from places. The chicken and beef are tender and not dry and full of so much flavor and the beef is like real cuts of steak!!! The fried rice has peas, eggs, onions, and carrots it's flavorful even without the meat.    Now to the banana tapioca pudding..... i'm not gonna lie this blew my mind. Am I being a little dramatic??? No. You see I'm not a big fan of pudding or tapioca or coconut... I know all the things that's delicious dessert is made of... however, I decided to broaden my horizon's and try something new and boy am I glad I did!!! It was the perfect hint of sweet, enough to get rid of my sweet tooth but not to the point where I feel like I have diabetes.  and the hint of steamy coconut milk to top it off made it that much better! A nice light dessert I'm definitely coming back for this!",

Why it took me so long to come back, I have no idea but I knew my husband would love it here so finally we came for dinner.   Honestly, I decided to order based on pictures on Yelp. Haha I showed the waitress a noodle dish and since the Yelpers did not title the picture, I had to ask - it's Katheaw Cha on the menu. We ordered that, the Bai Cha with Beef (fried rice) and grilled skewers.   The Katheaw Cha comes with shrimp and beef and it was delicious! Nothing was left on that plate! I loved the fried rice!!! I've been craving fried rice lately and it hit the spot. I probably would of changed the meat to chicken because I think the beef was a little rough and dry, but that's ok. The grilled skewers were perfectly marinated, but the meat looked a little skinny! I wish there was more meat on the skewers.   For dessert, I had the banana tapioca - a sweet hot soup with tapioca pearls and banana. My definition of dessert = chocolate and crust and maybe ice cream so this wasn't really a dessert to me, but I still liked the banana tapioca and ate it all!   Hubby of course loved the food too! For three entrees, one dessert, and one ice tea = $44 (plus tip). The best part: we had leftovers so we left with a doggie bag!",

Do these things  order the lemongrass soup. its subtle sublimity will massage you into a state of unconscious bliss  order the student noodles. the flavors (oyster sauce, pork, lime garlic) will jump up, slap you across the face, and then sing to you until you float away on a happiness cloud to happy land and are happy forever  order pleah beef salad. this one is real simple. they describe it as \"beef ceviche\". yup. no more explanation needed.  finally, order the amok fish. its beauty.   i love you Reathrey Sekong",

Ok, ok I managed to get passed all that. My party consisted of 6 people. Everyone had ordered, so here comes the food.. Mine came out first, I waited for more plates to come out but after a good 10 minutes I said fuck it. My food was getting cold. So I began to eat. Then came another plate..time passes, then another. We all ate one by one. I had a friend finally get her plate after everyone had finished eating. No apologies, no compensation. I guess they figured out it was my bday so they brought out a dessert which no one asked for, and still charged me for it :/ All I'm saying was, not the best experience ever, but I'll still return.. Too bad it made a sour first impression on a few of my guests..",

    "text": "Cambodian cuisine is definitely not one of those common cuisine you would pick when someone ask, \"What you wanna eat?\" (Don't say I don't know....!)  However, now you can say how about Cambodian?  Yes, the one and only one Cambodian restaurant in Phoenix is here!  We had a group gathering here for dinner (NAAAP) and the food was delicious!  I can't say the actual name, but I'll use my best Engrish - Beef & Shrimp marinated salad/beef skewers/pot roast soup/fried tilapia topped with mango.  Okay sounds to me like a typical cuisine, but no dude....it was awesome.  Found out Cambodian cuisine is not spicy like I thought it would be.    Our service was great, this when the restaurant was booked by our entire group - Kudos!  Ambience was really homey - I gather if I lived in a Cambodian household that is....  The decors were originally from Cambodia purchased by the owner (Yut).  I didn't want to touch anything; felt like I was in a museum.  Towards the end of the night I start to make dessert - yes \"Me\" was cooking!  They showed us how and what ingredients.  Needless, to say I didn't perfect the art, but it still passed and was yummy!  Take that Chef Ramsey! - Enjoy!",

The salad was a perfect combo of salty, sweet, tangy, crunchy, and soft.  The beef, since it is cooked rare, is very tender, and because it is marinated in a sweet vinegary type marinate, you don't really notice the rawness of the meat.  The sausages were kind of reminiscent of Chinese sausage, except thicker and more savory/salty.  The sausage is red like Chinese sausage is, except it is more of a sweet/sour type sausage rather than mostly sweet like Chinese sausage is.    Service was adequate, although they ran out of diet coke that day so I couldn't get my fizzy caffeine fix for the day.",

    "text": "On our recent trip to Phoenix, we thought we'd try this place after finding it on Yelp.  We came in for dinner half an hour before closing.  We parked our car at the parking lot, and I didn't know what to expect.  The parking lot was empty, and there was nothing pleasing outside.  However, the moment we opened the door, we were pleasantly surprised by the ambiance of the place.  The wooden tables, perfect dim lighting, Cambodian paintings, and Cambodian artifacts were truly special.  The lady who served us was very nice and welcoming.  We ordered beef skewers, the barbecue platter, and mango boba.  As we waited for our food, my son wanted to sit in the area where they had Cambodian musical instruments display.  The lady server was gracious enough to let my son sit there to take pictures.  My husband and son loved the beef skewers.  We all loved the overall experience, but I'm taking one star off because the wings that came with the barbecue platter were too big therefore, lacked flavor.  The mango boba was also incredibly sweet that my son took one sip and couldn't drink the rest.  If we are back in town, we will try this place again and perhaps will order something else to try.  Overall, a great place to try.",

After a job interview one day, I decided to come here for lunch...Place is a little small, so you might drive past it a couple times before finding it.  When I walked in, I was greeted by a waiter who was wearing traditional Cambodian clothes...Pretty cool...  I decided to get the Khmer BBQ rice platter. It came with 2 beef skewers, 2 chicken wings, pickled carrots/radish salad, 1 eggroll and rice. It was delicious...It felt like home cooking to me.  The only complaint I have is that it left me hungry still. The portions could be bigger but the prices are very cheap here so I guess it works.  I'll definitely be coming back sometime soon when I miss my mom's cooking.",

    "text": "I had lunch at Sekong by Night with a couple of foodnik friends on its second day of business.  Overall the experience was worthy of four-stars.   First, the design - it appears to have formerly been a Mexican restaurant and an Italian eatery of sorts, and vestiges of both decors abound, though the owners have gone to great lengths to give it an Indochine feel. All around a pleasant dining atmosphere with spacious booths flanking a long table that would be suitable for a large group.  The food was great; it was like Vietnamese food's understated cousin, which I guess it technically is.  The menu offered a handy guide to the meals, and often compared a dish to it's Vietnamese counterpart.  I had a spring roll, which was large and delicious. The fish sauce it came with appeared to be nuoc mam, but was a little sweeter than the nuoc mam at other places around town. Katheaw is the Cambodian cousin of pho, and in presentation looks exactly  like pho (vermicelli noodles in a broth with meats and vegetables); the broth, however, bore no taste resemblence to pho broth, and if anything tasted more like chicken noodle soup than pho. I opted for the Katheaw Phnom Pehn, and while I found it delicious, be aware that it is offal-heavy, and if you don't like the taste of liver, you won't like the amount they put in it.    My lunch companions' meals looked delicious, and I had a taste of one of their sandwiches.  Again, the sandwich was very similar to banh mi (those French made inroads on the local Southeast Asian cuisine, I'll tell you), but featuring beef rather than pork, and heavy with the taste of lemongrass, which I'd never noticed in the banh mi I've had.  I'm a junkie for Pho Thanh, but I suspect I'm going to put Sekong by Night into the rotation.",

I've never really had Cambodian food before so I cannot say that I am an expert but I do know Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese, so I'm also not totally naive.   The restaurant is small with only around 10 tables. This means that you may have to wait. Luckily we had a reservation since there were 8 of us and only one large table. The servers there are very nice and know the menu well as stated in past reviews. They are also very helpful to ask for opinions or recommendations if you think the menu looks a little intimidating.   The food was very good. We really enjoyed the chicken wings and had several noodle dishes that I cannot remember the name of. We also had the beef skewers which I thought was find but my wife did not care for it. All in all it was a good \"secret\" place for a well priced meal. If you are headed to this restaurant be sure to use a GPS because we even passed by it using our Garmin. Parking is in the back.

When a new restaurant opens I tend to go there often. Just to try all the food they offer to see what are the good and bad on their menu. Or if the place is even worth to even keep going!   Having tried  all the dish my favorite is the Beef noodle soup with a side of Fried Bread sticks. Its similar to Vietnamese Pho but with its own Cambodian flavor. Only downfall is I wish they offer the bigger bowl so I can get a food coma!! haha. I will definitely go here from now on to eat the Beef Noodle soup as I think it tops the Vietnamese Pho.  Overall its a place I will continue to go.  Warning though its a family owned business so the service is slow. But the food is well worth the wait!!!!",

This includes condensed milk and slow drip coffee that you have to patiently watch drip into the milk. Once completed, stir and add ice!  Spring rolls - one per serving, but they're huge and include chicken and shrimp.   Ginger chicken - somewhat small proportion, but well priced with plenty of flavor.   Ambiance is quaint and clean with Cambodian music playing in the background. Service was great with friendly faces. Can't go wrong with this one.",

    "text": "We came upon this restaurant by reading some Yelp reviews. When we were trying to find it, we drove by it completely as the building wasn't marked clearly. The space inside was very small - only about 10 tables, and the night we went it was pretty much completely packed ... We were seated at the last empty table. The ambiance was very tranquil, a good place to go with a small group. We browsed the menu & ordered one egg roll & one spring roll each as an appetizer. They both came with a tasty dipping sauce but the egg roll was by far way better than the spring roll. The waiter was nice enough to bring us samples of their two popular drinks - the basil seed & one that tasted kind of banana-y. We weren't really a fan of either so we didn't end up ordering any. I did however order the shrimp dish for dinner & while incredibly delicious, I was disappointed as I was still hungry after eating it completely. There were a few pieces of shrimp sauteed in a soy sauce based sauce and a few large pieces of green onion which are completely inedible and more like just a garnish. I guess I'm more used to eating Chinese food & love some sort of vegetable medley with meat or seafood in that sort of a sauce which is why I think for me, this would have been a more filling & fulfilling meal if the shrimp came with some broccoli and/or other vegetables. So in short, our food was flavorful and what was served made sense ... I just left wishing there was more.",

I didn't love everything we had but I did like most of it and loved a coupe things.  That's the benefit of going with a bunch of friends,you get to try more items.    For me, I normally won't order fish in an unknown restaurant .  BUT the mango grilled fish was one of my favorite items !  I was surprised to say the least.  The curry soup was also on the love list for me, even though some others were not crazy about it.  Such is life, taste is subjective just like art.  The egg rolls had a very interesting list of ingredients including black mushrooms so I couldn't resist that, and I loved them.   I will say that the managements recommendation that we eat \"family style\" was the right call.  The small kitchen there is not able to bring out 10-12 entrees at a time.  We were happily munching on one or two platters at a time while they were cooking the next ones. So don't let that scare you away if your going with a group",

The location near 12th St and Indian School (near the 99 cent Store and Mo Pawn) might throw you, but don't let it... take this excursion to deliciousness and you will be back. Our group of 4 ordered 4 different dishes and were all happy. The Amok Fish (Tilapia in a savory curry coconut sauce, served over spinach in a folded banana leaf) was superb. The accompanying side of Melon Soup was quite flavorful. The Spring Rolls are very like what you'd get in any good Vietnamese restaurant but still a \"must munch\", startling texture contrasts with shrimp, chicken and crisp veggies in a sticky chewy rice wrapper, light and refreshing with the little ramekin of fish sauce. After your meal, splurge on the Iced Coffee... OMG! I hated cold coffee until I tried this. Now I'm an addict.   Add friendly attentive service and a delightful atmosphere to the mix of awesome food, and you have a winner in Reathrey Sekong. Can't wait to go back.",

The spring rolls are as lovely as they are fresh, and my mango juice was quite tasty. However, I have never consumed something so extraordinary as the lemongrass stir-fry. Not only did this dish taste delicious, but it was packed with so many dynamic and complimentary textures that I had to pause to collect myself every few minutes between bites. It was truly an experience! That being said, it was not heavy or overly sauced in the slightest way. The banana tapioca pudding can--and should--be similarly praised. Even if you're not a sucker for texture like I am, eating these dishes will prove just as entertaining and far more satisfying than seeing the latest blockbuster. Seriously! There are so many things going on in these dishes that are unlike anything you've ever tasted before--I suppose I should speak for myself, but try it if you don't believe me. Yet, the food is not excessively overwhelming--more so it is an eclectic ballet in which various subtle aspects of flavor and texture reveal themselves to you over the course of each bite. It's all quite exciting, and wonderfully reasonable cost wise as well! Sure, the restaurant looks a little down-scale/decrepit from the outside, but I promise you, you will not regret the trip!!!!",

    "text": "I don't even understand how such a nondescript-looking (from the outside at least) little place could be so delicious.   Upon the very high recommendations of this restaurant on Yelp, we came here on our first night in Phoenix starving and with high expectations (usually a disastrous combination), but oh my god did this place meet and surpass those expectations!   First of all, it should be noted that the portions here are massive. Although it does only say \"vegetable roll\" on the menu (which might make the $3 price tag a little steep), what it doesn't say is that that vegetable roll takes up an entire place, and really could be classified as a wrap sandwich if it wanted to. Then for the main dishes... oh my god... our waiter recommended we get the 'small' versions of the dishes, and we were extremely glad we did. What here is called 'small', anywhere else would be considered a perfectly normal, if not even slightly generous portion.   Regardless of all that about portion sizes though, what really stood out was the food itself- obviously prepared with very good ingredients, the dishes' delicate flavouring came out excellently all around (we sampled the beef lemongrass stir-fry, the amok fish, and the vegetable soup). Although it is incredibly easy to eat a lot for the first two courses, I would definitely recommend leaving at least a little bit of space for dessert. We had the banana tapoica, and it was absolutely divine!  Anytime we're be back in Phoenix, we will definitely be coming back here!",

    "text": "You're probably asking yourself, what in the world does \"Sekong by Night\" mean? Well, the answer is, oooh just some classic, popular Cambodian song title that the owner is obsessed over. :)  As previously mentioned by another fellow Yelper, Sekong does exude charm.  In fact, most of the artistic, decorative items that is seen in the dining room is a straight import from mainland Cambodia (ie. table cloths, paintings, sculptures, and other artworks).  Obviously, the owner wanted to not only deliver authenticity from a cuisine standpoint but also historically and culturally.  They did a magnificent job in creating a nice visual display to sort of educate first time consumers of Khmer cuisine.  To get an idea of what Khmer dishes are like, I always say they're a cousin to Vietnamese and Thai cuisine.  Although, I think they just share ideas or possibly just steal from one another.  One prime example of idea sharing that you might find in a Vietnamese menu is the Luc Lac.  And actually, this creation was French inspired.  It's basically steak meat that has been cut into cubes and sauteed to a tender perfection fused with caramelized onions and garlic to give a richer taste.  The dish usually comes with a side of white rice and a fresh salad that has been lightly soaked in a sweet, citrus, vinagry dressing.  Its fantastic when done right!  In fact, I really enjoy Sekong's version! Its a must try! [Recommend]  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kBJfBVaXJtPEKLTov1hJdQ?select=yeZLfWYl0CMkhNM9T73i_w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/kBJf...</a>  Sekong also serves tasty sandwiches like the Vietnamese Banh Mi.  I have only tried their grilled beef.  From what I recollect tasting, it was meat marinated in a savory, lemon grass.  The baguette was very toasty and had a soft interior while the pickled veggies were fresh tasting. [Recommend]  And the cultural similarity theme continues! They also serve a crispy crepe-like dish that encompasses pork, shrimp and bean sprouts called, Baynchaiv, traditionally a finger food.  You take your lettuce and create a wrap and dip it into home made fish sauce. [Recommend]  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kBJfBVaXJtPEKLTov1hJdQ?select=dmpDwgYQUk68LqY3tGx3fw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/kBJf...</a>  Loat Cha, my other go-to dish, are these 1-inch round rice noodles drenched lightly in soy sauce and then pan fried served with fresh, crispy bean sprouts, green onions, and sliced beef topped with one egg.  [Recommend]  Now, the chicken wings with a side of rice is quite tasty.  Last time I ordered one, the chicken came out nicely crisped with a hint of peking flavor, which is a notorious marinade for Chinese roast ducks.  As for snacks and specialty drinks, I've had their tempura sweet potato and banana, and grass jelly drink.  All were excellent.  The tempura snacks came out super crispy with a fresh tasting interior.  If you are unfamiliar with grass jelly, it is basically semi-bland jello with a slightly sweet, grassy flavor, but in creating a refreshing drink, jello are cut up into tiny cubes while adding ice, sugar and honey.  The one item that has bothered me for awhile now is the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup, also the counter to Vietnamese Pho.  The only reason why I have hesitated for this long is, admittedly, due to the exotic-ness (ie. pork liver, heart, tripes, etc).  As soon as I can grow a third ball, I will attempt it! Just kidding, I will eventually.  The menu is not as large but being new to the food scene, they are looking to start off small and expand as business blossom.    By now, you may have already read about the lengthy wait, awkward location, and whatever shenanigans have you not, they are still working out the kinks and are continually listening to feed backs.    Pricing is very reasonable and competitive with the other Southeastern Asian power houses in the Valley [$5 - 10 range].  I will continue to be a regular here and add more updates as I try more items.",

The building can be easy to miss but there is plenty of parking, which is nice. The restaurant is tastefully decorated and the service, while a little slow at times, is still pretty good. I liked that our server explained what each dish was and how to eat it; I'm new to Cambodian food so his explanations were really helpful.  We had a beef noodle dish, which was really tasty. I like the texture of the noodles and the beef had a wonderful flavor. We also had a beef dish with a sour, crunchy sauce, raw vegetables, and rice. The beef was good, and the sauce was very interesting. Our last dish was fish - really great flavor. Again, I didn't see the menu so I can't list the names of the dishes - sorry! :(  I did feel the portions were a little small for the price, but I do realize that the ingredients are probably expensive to purchase in Phoenix, so I can understand the justification for the price. It wasn't outrageously expensive, so I was fine with the final cost of our meal. Overall, very nice food and very cute restaurant.  I would have given this restaurant 4 stars but I decided to only give 3. I love Yelp, and I depend on reviews, good and bad, to help guide my decisions. I do agree that the customer is not always right, but I think the high and low ratings for this restaurant are fair because everyone has a different experience, palate, expectations, etc. I'm fine with the owner defending the restaurant against poor reviews, but many of his replies mock the customer, contain rude language, and just leave a bad impression. I think both owners and customers have a duty to treat one another with respect, which I don't see here.  I am all for supporting local businesses, and I would love to come back, but I'm honestly not sure I will. I am curious to see what scathing reply the owner will leave to this review (if any).",

My parents are from Vietnam; Cambodia and the former share similar flavors and techniques. The pork dish at Reathrey Sekong was 99.9% identical to what my mother would have made at home. From the burnt/caramelizing parts of the pork to the cucumbers! It's truly authentic. The only difference was the nuoc mam - a dipping fish sauce, lacked bits of raw garlic. I'm 1,000 miles away from home (Dallas) and this one, simple dish took me back there...with my mom yelling at me to finish my homework.",

I will agree with another reviewer that the booths offer stiff and uncomfortable seating.  Our server was nice and attentive - always had our waters full, etc. The food did take a while to arrive after we ordered even though it wasn't very busy.  At least there's a sign out front warning of slow food service.  My friends and I shared loat cha, fish amok, and the beef special with raw vegetables and fish sauce.  The portions were small in my opinion for the price.  We ordered the family style sharable sizes which were supposed to be larger than the single combo plates.  If this were the case, I wonder how much smaller those portions are.   Presentation of each dish was very nice, much more \"bougie\" than any other Cambodian restaurant I've been to. I like the slimy texture of the loat cha, but found the sauce on it to be a bit too salty and some noodles to be hard. The beef on it was tender and the egg added some flair.  The flavors of the amok were good. However, I prefer a meatier fish like catfish for this dish. I don't think the fragility of tilapia lends itself well to amok even though it's not an uncommon fish to see. The beef on the last plate was well cooked and good with the sauce.  It was a strange combination with the limited raw vegetables, but everything went well with the rice.   We had to pay for rice per person, which I am not a fan of.  I think rice should be free and/or included in Asian restaurants that serve dishes eaten with rice.  Reathrey has the benefit of being the only restaurant like it around.  While it provides a good intro to the SEA (Southeast Asian) newbie, I don't think the value and execution of its food warrant its such high marks on yelp.",

We got the green mango grilled fish which was great, and the curry which was great as well. Not spicy like thai curry but the same amazing flavor of the coconut milk and spices. The only complaint I have, which I seem to always have with Cambodian restaurants, is that it always seems a little watered down for the American palate - which I get because things like fish sauce and shrimp paste can be off putting to people who aren't used to it.",

    "text": "Love . It!    The flavors blew my mind, so much that I am called to my rarely-visited Review button on Yelp.  Although I'm not Cambodian, I am Southeast Asian and had grown up with a cuisine full of very rich, pungent flavors like these.  I'm talking about the ones that make your tongue do a double-take:  You hesitate after the first bite, but then realize it was love that you are feeling.    I tried the Phnom Penh noodle soup, which was good.  What especially impressed me were the Grilled beef with thuk prahok and the bok lahong salad.  Authentic as can be and I have not had that anywhere other than at my boyfriend's Cambodian family's (by the way he approves too).  Trying these dishes were so exciting for me because it reminded me of the fresh, pickled, seafood-salty culinary secrets coming out of my own grandmother's kitchen.  I enjoyed the simplistic dining experience, the out-of-the-ordinary surrounding, and concur with others who have found a gem in this restaurant.",

And he actually said, \"Well that's fine too.\" I have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant. At least he could have apologized. I loved this place a few years ago but perhaps due to their popularity they have gotten a bit big headed about it and assume they can insult customers because they have enough and don't need your business.",

    "text": "I am writing this review as of my most recent visit in July 2017.    This is the ONLY Cambodian restaurant in all of Arizona, says Yut, the owner's (cook) son who works here.  I came here many times from only myself, 2 other eating buddies, and several times with larger groups of 10 or more (MeetUps).  Pretty much all the people I ate with agree, that the amount of food on the entree you ordered, is rather skimpy for the price that you pay.  For instance I felt sorry that one person in our large group of 10, generously passed his slice beef entree for everyone to try.  After each person took a piece, his dish that he was paying for, was all gone, and he was left with the rice.    And for this small amount of food for the price, you have to wait a long time for it, so be prepared, if you eat with a group of more than 4 and they are busy, some will be done eating their order, while other people are still waiting for their order to be delivered to the table.  This is because there is only one cook (mom) and person in the kitchen (daughter?) to help her and son who serves the food outside the kitchen.    If you wanna not wait so long, I would go on an off hour,like 2:30 pm and not during regular lunch and dinner on the weekends.    Also if you want to show up with a group of 12 or more than 10, you either wait a very long time or they will tell you they cannot serve you.  If you want to make reservations for more than 10, you have to agree that they cookyou a pre-selected menu, each table eats the same dishes that they cook in advance \"family style\".  Each table has to eat the same pre-selected set.  That is what I was told by Yut a couple of years ago, and things have not changed in space.  One time we had a group of 15 (3 tables of 5) eating pre-selected dishes as described, and after 2.5 hours, we were about to leave, and the last dish still had not come out of the kitchen.  Another time we ate here with a group of 10, but not pre-selected menu in advance.  We all ordered when we arrived.   Other than another 4 people at a booth on this Wed night, we were the only ones in the restaurant.  Still took a long time, meaning some people finished eating, and saying goodbye, while others had not gotten their food yet.  So don't go here with a large group unless you are OK with \"waiting\" and not eating together.  They have a very small kitchen and one mom to cook for you, seemingly one dish at a time.      There USED to be a sign at the door asking you for your patience, that every dish is prepared from scratch just for you, so begs your patience in waiting time, some words to that effect.  but the sign was not there July 2017.  Otherwise I rate the taste of the food 4 stars, service 2-3 stars (cos of incidents like serving a large bowl of soup without giving us bowls, running out of bowls and water glasses, and another time serving soup without thinking about giving us spoons, and very slow service, even tho service was polite).    Value for dollar 2 stars.  So altogether 3 stars.    Since it is important to ME to have value for price (which truly authentic  Chinese restaurants at least are good at providing, or REAL Chinese would not eat there), and me being Chinese, the food here is not so tasty for me to be a repeat customer here again and again.  But I tell you my favorite dish is the lemon grass soup with coconut milk, and I order a bowl or rice to add more contents into the soup, as I said they are not very generous with ingredients in a dish.  It makes a meal for me without having to order something else.",

Green Mango grilled fish with rice; it was pretty good and fresh I really enjoyed this dish.   They have Lao and Cambodian beer and other selections as well; staff is very attentive and talkative-very friendly.  I love that they play Cambodian music from the 1970s (which is a mix of  Rock, soul, Latin, psychedelic etc).   The dessert I had was sticky mango and white rice wrapped in banana Leaf (On the menu it's listed as jackfruit sweet rice); again A very good dish....I've travelled to Southeast Asia and had my palate treated to great Cambodian food, and I must say this place was very authentic .... The pricing here is not competitive (can be expensive) my dish plus dessert and a beer total $29, which is a lot of money for dinner for one person-but what can you expect when there are very few Cambodian restaurants in the Phoenix area.",

The tables are crammed a little tighter than would be comfortable, and after dodging around a large group at the Centre table, we found our way into a booth underneath a painting of Angkor Wat.  I ordered an Angkor Beer (not as good as the 'Cambodja Beer' made by Khmer Brewery, but still a suitable import) and my fiancee ordered something with grass jelly in it. Both were satisfying.  I had particularly wanted to try the Lok Lak, as it was a favorite in Cambodia. Unfortunately, it appeared to contain romaine lettuce. Because of the recent e.coli outbreaks in Yuma, we changed the order and got the BBQ Platter and a salad instead. Both were delicious. The salad and the beef skewers in particular reminded me of Cambodian flavors!  Service was a little slow, perhaps because of the large group that was there. But overall, if you want to try something new, or are looking for a taste of Cambodia as I was, it's a good choice!",

The only critique I have to address is probably the decor and the service. Sadly this place only has one person waiting tables. When more people arrived it took awhile for other tables to order and recieve food. The decor was a bit over the top. The restroom had too many things including a water heater. They had a really cool antique horoscope machine in the restroom but sadly it wasnt functional. In addition there was flowers and a poster; it was too much for a restroom. The decor outside was fine but for some reason they had unuseable or undrinkable bottles on tables. I just remembered how worn out the menus were, most were falling apart down the middle. I think it couldve been better. Frankly if the food wasnt so good I probably wouldn't dine here.  Experience: 4/5  Food: 5/5 (awesome) Price: $$ Service: 4/5 (definitely couldve used another waiter)",

We spent time looking over the menu and asking our server questions about items and a few minutes later we ordered. I got the vegetarian noodle soup and bai cha with shrimp, and my friend tried something new and got the lemongrass chicken noodle plate. She loved her dish, and both my soup and rice plate were delicious. Nothing was spicy, so I added some hot sauce that was on the table (there was also fish sauce but I don't like it). I took more of the rice with me in a box and finished the soup, which comes with a bowl filled with cilantro, sprouts, and lemon. The soup had broccoli, carrots, scallions, spinach and a large leaf of lettuce on the side of the bowl. The rice has a nice mix of veggies, eggs, and the shrimp which had a yummy sauce on it.   It did take a while to receive our food, but I expected that having heard from people who have been before. I do wish there were more vegetarian options, especially since I wanted to try their egg rolls and spring rolls. Since I eat seafood, I would've loved to try their spring roll, but it had chicken in addition to shrimp. They had some drink choices but we both ordered water. Overall I was excited to finally try Cambodian food and I'd come back to try some of their fish dishes.",

Couldn't figure out what took so long until they arrived all charred and sticky from the grill. I can't remember name of dish i had but it was a traditional noodle dish and I had it dry which means the broth comes on the side. It was very good. We also order the spring rolls which were fresh and vibrant with addition of mint. I like it my daughter not so much. This was  so funny a lady of Asian decent came up to see what we were eating. She lives in area but had never been.  We became fast friends. She ordered the grilled pork dish and completely insisted I try. Wow. It was soooo good. I almost ordered some to stick in my suitcase. Thought better of it but clearly it come from same grill. It was juicy and well seasoned. Our other fast friends said their meal was good too. One ordered the grilled seafood plate. So I am yelping for them as well. This is a treasure.",

I have had years of travel and exposure to Vietnamese food, Chinese, Indian, (the best of each is, sadly, not in Arizona) so trust me, Reathrey Sekong is really, really good. As they say on their menus, Cambodian cuisine is a fusion of Asian, Indian, French, Chinese representing the influences to Cambodian culture, so you will experience lovely flavors, colors, presentations and preparations. Be prepared to be delighted!",

I ordered the Amok fish, which was one of the best things I ate while in Cambodia.  Sekong's tasted like a bad frozen dinner that had been reheated several times.  I didn't finish it because I was scared I would get sick. Not impressed by the beef sandwich - beef wasn't fresh, bread was too hard, cilantro seems like it may not have been washed thoroughly enough.  The egg rolls and soup were nothing to write home about.  Also, we were not aware this is not in a great part of town.  We wanted to sit facing the door but our bench was wobbly....booo.  We were on guard in the parking lot and finished our meal quickly and made our way back to the highway.  Don't do it!",

    "text": "I will preface by stating that I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here. At first glance it is similar to every other mom-and-pop Asian diner in town but definitely unique enough to warrant going out of your way for it. The menu isn't necessarily vast but the choices they have make it difficult to decide what to eat, everything sounds delicious.  I had the Amok plate with a Basil drink, which came with a side of rice, lightly pickled veggies, a spring roll, and some warm cucumber soup. I had been instructed to mix the cucumber soup with the rice, which was delicious. The fish itself was served on some greens with a coconut curry sauce in a banana leaf boat (classy touch). Also, I must say that I do not typically eat fish in AZ but this was surprisingly tasty.  After having completely cleared my plate I couldn't help but get some dessert, of which they have a few that all sounded fantastic. I opted for the warm tapioca pudding with banana and coconut milk... I will be going back just for this, it was that good.  Sure it may not have the best location and the dining room may be a bit cramped but I did peek back in the kitchen and it was kept very clean (always a good sign). The service was great and helpful and the food was delicious. They also play native Cambodian Jazz and oldies which makes for a very enjoyable atmosphere.  If you like this kind of food, I don't know anywhere else in town that you can get it and would question if it could be any better. After today, I will be adding Sekong By Night to my recommendations list.",

    "text": "Wow! What an amazing find! I must have driven right by this place at least a hundred times and never noticed it. So glad a friend recommended it to me. Its hard to find because it its in a plane building and entrance is in the back, but totally worth it! When we first walked it in we were so impressed with the atmosphere. Really cozy, with nice ambiance, and modern with Camboadian art and flare. Perfect date restaurant. The owner was our server and he gave us amazing service even though it took us forever to order. I am vegan and was a little worried as the menu didn't look like it had much for me. I told him I don't eat meat or dairy and he suggested several things that were on the menu that we would make into veg. I was a little worried that veg stuff would be half heartedly made since it wasn't listed...        The first thing we ordered was the spring rolls that he said he would have made veg and even made sure to give me the house made dipping sauce without any fish sauce. They were delicious! Then we ordered to split the Curry soup- made veg. So delicious! It had eggplant, potatos, tofu, some herbs.  It was served with rice and reminded me of red thai food curry, but not as heavy. Flavor was on point! Then I ordered the Katheaw Cha -made veg. It's a rice noodle dish with flat noodles, tofu, collard greens, carrots, and some other veggies. This is was my favorite! Seriously some of the BEST TOFU I HAVE EVER HAD! The seasonings in this dish were so, so good. You could tell it had been marinating for a long time. It wasn't something that was just thrown together quickly. I ate every bite of this even though I was so, so full by the end. I can't say enough good things about this dish. I will definitely be back to have it again!       My friend ordered the traditional curry fish dish that was wrapped in a banana leaf. She has been to Cambodia and had it there, so was eager to try it here. She loved it but said it was still better in Cambodia. We were both stuffed by the end of the mean and had plenty of left overs.   I highly, highly. highly recommend checking this place out. What an awesome find, and so close to my house! If you are veg, don't be scared to check this place out. Its so worth it. I will be back again soon!",

The restaurant was tiny, and packed for a Monday night.  Before seating us, our server warned us that there was a long wait for food, but we weren't starving nor in a rush, so we decided to go with it.  The problem was, there was a long wait for everything.  We had to wait 15 minutes awkwardly by the door for an already empty table to be cleared, it took 15 additional minutes after ordering to get water, and a coffee that was ordered at the beginning of our meal came an hour later.   The food was good, but this place needs to plan better for how busy they get.  Although, it's understandable why things were slow, as there seemed to be one cook, and one server, the wait was so long, I doubt I'd return here again.",

I ordered Amok today.  It took 25 min for my food to arrive even though there was no other customer in the restaurant. When I got my food, I was shocked as it costs $13 but the portion is so small. If they were to price it at $5, I will still think it is expensive as the portion is extremely small.....  After finishing the food, I started to feel thirsty for the rest of the day... I guess it was because of too much MSG??   Anyway, I would not go back to this restaurant as it doesn't serve great food and it is so pricey.",

Unfortunately, since the menu items on their website aren't posted, I have no idea what the food dish names are, but the one dish was beef and the other was chicken.  The beef dish was served on a bed of veggies.  Both were quite good and were seasoned to perfection.   We tried the tapioca dessert.  I was stuffed so barely did a taste test.  It was okay; I'm not a big fan of tapioca, but he liked it.  It is a family run operation.  Mom and Auntie cook and son and cousin serve in the dining hall.  We talked to son, Yut.  He told us the history of starting the restaurant. My suggestion for them is get better signage.   Unless one has one's eyes peeled, it is hard to see.   I'd definitely go there again.",

    "text": "Finally, a Southeast Asian food pulse around CenPho. When I first moved here, one of the things I noticed was how few choices there were when it comes to Asian cuisine. So nice to see something a little less common like Cambodian food get represented.   The spring rolls are a must. For $2, you get a very heavily stuffed roll of rice paper touting chicken, shrimp, cilantro, carrots, etc. The beef salad is also a winner. The seafood soup is flavorful and just might literally nourish the soul. The sandwiches with the pork pate are a great lunch choice. One day, I got one plus a roll to go--all under $6. Of the desserts, everyone should try the sweet and salty corn at least once. The tapioca is my favorite. Light and warm.   The best part about eating here is knowing that your money is going toward a very genuine and kind Cambodian family. I have spoken with the chef/owner's son every time I go in. A real sweet guy who will demonstrate how to play the xylophone-esque instrument that is the centerpiece of the main dining room. Speaking of, I love all the touches of decor i.e. travel books on Cambodia at every table.   I really, really hope this place does not go the way of some mom-and-pop operations in Phoenix that had really great things to offer. I've been disturbed by the lack of customers I've seen a few times. I want this restaurant to really succeed. I don't want the lines out the door (otherwise I can't get in. ;P) but I want to see a steady stream of patrons. This place really has a chance to be a good-size fish in a big pond. It doesn't fit a cookie-cutter mold and it's got a fantastic bill of fare to show off.",

    "text": "Ok, I waited too long to write this review and now I can't remember the names of all the dishes I tried at Reathrey Sekong. And there were a lot of them. I went with a group of 14 or so Yelpers and we each ordered something off the menu and then everyone got to try it. Well, I guess it doesn't matter what they names are because I can tell you we sampled the majority of the menu and I enjoyed every single dish. It was all super yummy! I came here not knowing anything about Cambodian food and after our huge feast I would say that it is sort of a cross between Thai and Vietnamese which is not a shock given where the country is located geographically.  My favorites were the ginger beef, some thick rice noodles that came with beef and shrimp, and the mango white fish. I also thought the fried eggrolls were very tasty and I really loved the sauce that came with them. Actually each dish had it's own little sauce and I thought they all were delectable. I love those sweet and sour vinegary sauces that are served with southeast Asian food. For some reason they hit my palate just right. The only dish I was somewhat lukewarm about was a dish that had pieces of fish in a coconut curry sauce. But I generally don't care for curries with coconut milk in them so no surprise there. If you are not adventurous get the bbq platter. This came with a variety of meats and was pretty plain compared to all the other dishes that were so full of flavor.  Our waiter I believe was the owner and he was extremely friendly and accommodating. The place is a bit small and so it was awkward with our large group in there but he didn't seem annoyed at all that we were taking up half the place. The ambiance was nice. A bit worn but clean. They had a small area that was decorated with what I assume was textiles and objects from Cambodia so that was cool. I would definitely come here again if it wasn't so far from where we lived. If you are in the area and looking to try something different, even if you have no connection whatsoever to Cambodia, stop and check them out.",

The restaurant itself on the outside is very simple and you probably wouldn't even realize it was there, unless you were looking for it. It's a very small cozy place and the food smells amazing as soon as you walk in! We ordered fried egg rolls to start. They were ok, I didn't like the sauce that comes with it and the egg rolls themselves didn't really leave me wanting more.   The entrees are family style so we shared all the dishes. We ordered chicken bai cha (fried rice), grilled pork, and lok lak beef. The bai chia was good and they served plenty to share. The lok lak beef was too bland. The meat didn't really have much flavor and the veggies that accompanied it were just as bland. The best part of our meal was the grilled pork. This is the dish that they are known for, and recommend; and it didn't disappoint! The dish was just strips of pork but the flavor was amazing!  The sauce made it very flavorful and great! I couldn't get enough of that dish. I would highly recommend trying the grilled pork; but beyond that, none of the other dishes were memorable.",

My husband and I came here for lunch on Saturday and we ordered the following:  Jasmine Green Iced Tea - very flavorful, slightly floral, and quite refreshing  Fresh Spring Roll - similar to Vietnamese spring rolls, but these had some extra crunch to them. I'm not sure what different ingredients they used, but they're equally as good as Vietnamese ones I've had.  Shrimp ling - grilled shrimp in an oyster sauce, this was full of flavor and fantastic! The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious.  Loat cha - round thick rice noodles, with fresh bean sprouts, beef, brown sauce, and a fried egg. We also loved this dish, the sauce was very good and the fried over-easy egg really added to the dish.   After finishing our meal, we both decided we will definitely come back. I really could just eat my way through their menu. Thank you Reathrey Sekong for making me a Cambodian cuisine fan!",

I had fish, beef, noodles, soup, salad, curry...I just tried it all! Why not? It's the best way to get an understanding of another cultures set of dishes. You can't really understand it unless you try many plates. Each one has its own structure: sour or spicy or what have you.  You also can't compare it to Thai or Vietnamese because it has its own subtle tastes. Its similar but if you try to compare you are setting yourself up for the wrong experience. Your expectation should be....no expectation other than \"I'm going to try Cambodian food today\" and just enjoy it, because you will! My picky four year even did! The decor is charming  and warm and filled with old family keepsakes brought from Cambodia. Books, art musical instruments, pictures and head dresses. Thanks for my delish meal tonight. I can tell the food was made with love and experience and nothing beats that!  I'll be back with my friends and co-workers. They love Cambodian food too! A couple have already been here. See you guys again...and again!!!!",

After a short wait we were seated in an adjacent room that felt a little like the family living room as it had great character. Because the restaurant was so busy and it is a small family-run establishment we did not expect to be served quickly. Fortunately we were there to enjoy the company as well as the food so the wait for our food passed quickly. We ordered five separate main dishes that were served in waves. We started with the noodle dish with beef that started our glands    palpitating in expectation of more succulent dishes to come. We then enjoyed a delightful barbecued pork dish and a fish dish with shredded mango (mmmmm). This was followed by another beef dish (loc lac) that was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Finally we had the crepe dish that was a mixture of flavors and fillings. The crepe dish was served last because it required two of the six kitchen burners to prepare and the restaurant wanted the food to reach us in the quickest way. We were all very full by the end of our gastronomic feast. Definitely one of the best meals I have ever eaten. We took at least two hours enjoying our meal. Don't come here if you are in a hurry!",

Yup,  that means luck, double luck in this case.  WOW.  Was I LUCKY to come to Reathrey?  YES!!! Egg rolls so delicious I had to order twice. Spring rolls (with tofu, instead of shrimp and chicken) that I had to order twice.  Maybe that coincides with the first number of this review!!!!  Yup.  That's it! Ordered beef & shrimp with noodles. Had some greens in it.  OMG how delicious and how fresh were the shrimp! Also, Beef with ginger, lots of it, gingerlicious. Beef with noodles, sprouts and a fried egg on top (I forgot the name)--it's on the left side of the menu...  amazingly delicious. All accompanied by Jasmine rice.   Don't know why I hadn't found this place before.   BTW, clean and decorated with tasteful Asian decor and lovely piped in Asian music.  Oh..... is this Nirvana or is 277 just my lucky number.",

My dish did take the longest, but we shared everything so I didn't mind the waiting. I enjoyed my dish more than the catfish. The noodles were perfect and the beef was sooo good. But that soup though.... Would go back just for that.   Be patient while waiting for food. It will be worth it.",

This is the type of hole-in-the-wall ethnic food that makes Phoenix such a foodie heaven.  Spring rolls - fresh, crisp, and full of flavor.  They make you feel like you're a healthy person by eating them.  Curry - this isn't your standard Thai curry.  This is a Cambodian curry.  I'm not sure if I did it right, but I drank it like a soup.  They provide rice, but the curry has such an awesome flavor that you really don't need the rice.  I either proved how cultured I am my eating the curry the \"correct\" way, or the chefs were taking pictures of me in the back and laughing their heads off.  Probably the latter.  Anyway, it's a yellow, tangy soup, loaded with veggies.  Try it.  Jackfruit steamed rice - melt-in-your-mouth sweet.  This is the perfect ending to the perfect meal.  My husband had some sort of meat that was tasty as well.  I get the feeling that you can't go wrong with anything off the menu here.  Great service, very well-done decor (I'd be well-impressed if I were brought here on a date night), and delicious yet affordable food.  You're going on my \"Best of Phoenix\" list.",

The place is dimly lite but filled with lots of Cambodian decor, the place is very spacious yet it also feels homey.  The food here is great, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I was warned about the house made fish sauce as it can be repelling to some, but I found it worked great with the grilled meat.  Actually everything on the menu was great!  Must Order Dish: Khmai bbq platter (you're welcome) Must Order Drink: Specialty drinks: basil + grass jelly drink  But what really puts Reathrey Sekong into the above and beyond category is the friendly service, you aren't getting some 3 Michelin star restaurant's treatment no..., you're getting what I consider something better, you're getting what feels like a home-cooked meal at home from your mom.  And actually you sort of are.  Yuth is the primary server and owner of this restaurant, he is extremely friend, honest, and has a wealth of information to share on what to do and where to explore in the Arizona area.  And the chef of the restaurant is his mom, so you're sort of getting a home-cooked meal.    For entrees that are around ~$13, you're getting a cozy atmosphere (great for casual dining or dates alike), a home-cooked meal that is fresh, quick, and of large portions alongside some of the friendliest service.  Decent Cambodian food is already hard to find, but great Cambodian food like what is served at Reathrey Sekong is truly a gem.  Everything about this place is just perfect.",

It is a byob restaurant so we brought our own bottle. It took 10 min for them to bring a wine opener out and then it was broken so it took another 5 min to get their attention to get another opener.

    "text": "It's hard writing this review being a Cambodian born and raised in Long beach, Ca because we wanted so much to love this and came out so incredibly disappointed. Having moved out to Az a little more than half a year ago, we were roaring for some Cambodian food and were so hopeful when we found what looks like the only Cambodian spot in Az . The space is small but cozy, decor is a mixture of cambodian and thai inspired art, some probably found from Ross or Ikea, which isn't to say it looked bad, just slightly inconsistent. The sporadic pictures and posters of famous Cambodian artist was a nice touch we would have liked to see more of. The music was a nice addition we enjoyed a lot. The service was good, but our food took some time to come out which we didn't mind overlooking at the time because we were so excited at the time... But...unfortunately, we have to say the food was not a good enough representation of good Cambodian food and was unfortunately not worth the wait.   We ordered the fish with mango salad, the fried rice with lok lak, and the bbq platter. We were so stoked to see the fish and mango salad on the menu, we were eager to order it. What we got was a sliver of catfish filet covered in mango salad that was missing it's basic flavors.  The catfish was incredibly fishy-like an unfresh, gamey fishiness that was simply too overpowering, we didn't finish what little piece we were served...the fried rice and lok lak was perhaps the one dish we all agreed couldn't go wrong...and for that was probably the worst. The fried rice tasted of too much soy sauce and the lok lak was so over seasoned  we couldn't finish it. It's important to mention it didn't come with it's signature lemon pepper sauce which may have helped cut down the saltiness. Meat wasn't what it should have been either, not tender but tough and chewy. The bbq platter which consisted of beef skewers, bbq chicken and bbq pork weren't bad per se...the beef skewers were the only thing that we all agreed was actually good. Something we could imagine getting from hak heang, crystals, la line, riverside market or even how mom would make it. The pork and chicken weren't necessarily bad but definitely lacking. Overall, the experience or service wasn't bad but we're sad to say the food and price isn't something we'd come back for.",

Had the Jasmine iced tea which was good on my insides, egg rolls...both kinds and lemongrass stir fry with beef because it said traditional flavors of Khmer.  Delicious.  Addicting.  Staff, as has been stated by others, is amazing.  Little difficult to find parking, which is around back.  Advice...drive W past to driveway on W Side of building, look to your R...parking and restaurant entrance.  Next time promise to try one of the drinks people raved about.  Wonderfully clean for being on ISR.  Amusing, not a criticism, the music was Cambodian covers of OLD country and western standards.  Might ask about it.  Go, ask questions, live a little on the wild side.  You will be HAPPY.",

The restaurant is ran and owned by a family. The food tastes like it was made with love and pride. Its authentic from the basil seed drink to the decor of the establishment. Another aspect I loved is that its BYOB. So you can drink a bottle of wine from home without having to pay an arm and a leg for it while you eat. The food is so good and cheap. I've never had anything that i didn't love!",

I have lived in Phoenix 26 years and this is the first time I visited or ever heard of this wonderful dining spot!  Four of us dined here last evening and it was truly a palate party if If my palate ever had one!  The flavors were distinctive, not over done, the food very fresh and each dish we tried was unique from the previous one.  The mango fish was very special and the lemon grass stir fry had a fabulous aroma and taste.  The appetizing spring rolls are huge; each could be lunch meals in themselves.  We tried several dishes each one as good or better than the last.  My only complaint, we couldn't try everything on the menu!  Ha, ha.  The place is a little difficult to find at night since it is in a nondescript building and the entrance is at the back of the building.  None-the-less after driving past it twice we found it and were glad we did.  It was totally well worth our determined effort.",

The atmosphere is fun and inviting, and you can learn about Cambodia from the books on the tables!  Pretty much every time I've been here, I have been that annoying group (four loud girls drinking too much coffee) that may stay past closing time and love that the owner is super nice to us regardless. My friends and I have never experienced bad service and every time we come in, we are greeted like we are long lost friends! The food is amazing. I have to admit that I come here mostly for the amazing coffee, that is not the same anywhere else but here or Cambodia, and the giant and inexpensive spring rolls. Because I've been here multiple times, with a few different groups of friends, I've sampled close to everything on the menu and have enjoyed it all. This is definitely a place that makes me reminiscent of my Asian travels and that, combined with all the wonderful-ness of it, will keep me coming back.",

After seeing someone order the Crepes stuffed with pork, cucumber and cilantro we had to order them... 2 huge Crepes on a big plate with all the fixings..great start to our meal. I got the stir fried shrimp which was served with rice and an Asian salad with chicken.  Another got the BBQ plate which was a huge serving of steak, kabobs and a chicken wing. My buddy got the Fish Amok which was very good. The plates looked like a work of art and although we had to ask for basic table stuff more than I would have liked the little Asian waitress was so sweet..another great find I wouldn't have known about if I hadn't seen it on yelp.",

It was a bit toasty one night, but I asked for the fan to be turned up. No problem. I love the books at the tables and the quaint and cozy feel. I just read \"Jess W. \" review about cash only, but I have always paid with a debit or other card. Is this new? I alwasy eat there at night though.

My fave in here is the katheaw cha, fat noodles with Chinese broccoli, shrimp and beef in what seems like an oyster sauce. The papaya salad is refreshing, also. The place has two dining rooms, with the smaller one to the east side of the building complete with a tiny little bar area.   Excellent ambience for a date. Family-run, and family serves you.",

Bottom line, check this place out! Seems to be the only Cambodian restaurant in ALL of Arizona, so make reservations b/c it can get busy. The decor is a fun, eclectic mix of traditional with 40s-50s memorabilia. The woman who waited on us was incredibly kind and accommodating to my dietary restrictions.

    "text": "Service was friendly, but I thought the food was rather lackluster. I could tell that the dishes were made with care, but the flavors just fell flat and didn't inspire me to want to return.  Reathrey Sekong is located in its own little plaza, complete with a parking lot in the back. The entrance is also in the back, and the inside decor is dim and has a traditional feel. The menu is relatively small and possesses descriptions of each item without pictures.  Spring roll with dipping sauce: This was indeed an enormous spring roll, probably the biggest I've seen. It wasn't bad, but a bit bland even with the provided dipping sauce. The server was kind enough to cut it into three pieces to share, and even then there was plenty to go around.  Fried rice with beef: The fried rice was made well and incorporated soy sauce, which I'm not too fond of. The beef came in braised cubes and was slightly overlooked, as evidenced by its slightly tough texture and chewiness. The beef was also too salty, and when paired with the soy sauce fried rice, the whole dish had too much sodium for me.  Student Noodles: This was an interesting dish, as it had noodles soaked in a soy-based (I think?) sauce that was diluted. I hadn't had a dish like it before, and I thought it wasn't bad, especially when paired with the crispy bean sprouts. I don't know whether I'd order it again, but I'm glad I tried it.  Barbecue pork: This was supposedly ranked as one of be top ten foods to try on CNN or something along those lines (as the menu indicated). I wasn't a fan. Some pieces were well-cooked and tender, but the majority veered on the dry side that turned to a sawdust-like texture when chewed. This dish was also really salty, and I have a hard time believing that it ranked as one of the top ten dishes to try.  Chances are I won't return, but I think this is an interesting restaurant to try at least once, if just for the Student Noodles.",

    "text": "Since I eat Cambodian food every week at home, I wasn't tempted to dine here, but my sis and mom have been wanting to check it out for a while.    We dined here a few weeks ago and left feeling...underwhelmed.  Service provided by the brother and sister duo was friendly; however, the food, although decent, was a bit too Westernized for my taste.  As another Yelper has mentioned, the portions are too small for the advertised prices.    We ordered the following (shared between five adults and one child):  1) beef noodle soup (similar to the Vietnamese pho / $6); 2) lok lac beef (marinated pan fried cubes of beef / $8); 3) chicken fried rice ($8); 4) pleah (beef salad $10); 5) bbq platter (shrimp & beef skewers, chicken wings / $14); and 6) pork/pate sandwich ($5).    The good: * entrees were presented beautifully on green plates reminiscent of banana leaves * with the exception of the pleah (beef salad), the food looked good and tempting * with the exception of the lok lac beef, food arrived in a fairly timely manner  * the beef skewers were delicious (can really taste the flavor of the marinade, especially the lemongrass) * iced coffee I ordered was good (albeit a bit weaker than the Viet kind / $3) * basil seed drink was good (and interesting to look at / $2) * as previously mentioned, service was friendly * the restaurant is decorated appropriately with Cambodian items  The bad: * while the rest of the entrees arrived within 20 minutes after ordering, my lok lac beef was brought to the table an HOUR later * the portion size of the lok lac beef is more indicative of a lunch serving, not dinner  * the flavor of the lok lac was decent, but not as robust as usual (perhaps the beef cubes weren't given enough time to marinate) * the pleah (beef salad) was TOO tart and had us thinking, \"where's the beef?\" (it did not look nor tasted like the traditional pleah we're used to - Cambodian beef ceviche)  * bring your sunglasses because the lighting in the restaurant is bright!!!  I know it makes sense to tone down some of the Cambodian flavors, but it's too toned down for my taste.  With that said, if you've not had Cambodian food, Sekong would be a good introduction to the dishes of Cambodia.  Sekong is to be commended for offering Cambodian food to valley residents.    For authentic Cambodian cuisine, you'll have to go to the LA area.  They don't care about toning down the flavors there to suit Western tastes, because shoot, there are loads of Asians to fill up their restaurants.  (In addition to the food pics from Sekong, I also posted a pic of lok lac beef I ordered from one of the LA restaurants...for comparison.)",

    "text": "It's places like this that reaffirm my undying faith (and dependency) on crowdsourcing restaurant sites like Yelp.  Here's an establishment I would otherwise pass by without a second thought, serving a type of cuisine that doesn't compute for 99% of Phoenix area residents (myself included), and would get absolutely zero buzz otherwise.  Its finding hidden gems like this using sources like Yelp that help me constantly rediscover a love for my local hometown culinary scene.  My brother-in-law is pretty open minded about trying things once so he humored me when I picked this place for dinner.  It was near his condo and the Yelp reviews for this place were pretty stellar.  But even I was apprehensive about this place.  I know absolutely zilch about Cambodia or their cuisine and not a single foodie I know has been to this place.  This really was a shot in the dark.  So we ventured here on a Saturday evening around 6:30.  The building has the restaurant's name out front, but there's nothing about the exterior that really stands out.  Parking in the rear, we almost entered through the kitchen by accident, but the chef gently guided us to the main entrance and the restaurant itself.  The place isn't that big and was starting to get busy when we arrived, but we got a table next to the window overlooking Indian School Road.  Interior is very simple with what appear to be mini Buddha statues on the tables and seating for maybe 20-25 people.  We took awhile to survey the menu since they don't post it on their website (which they really should by the way), and asked our waitress for suggestions.  After contemplation and seeing a dish that was endorsed by CNN (?!) I went with a small order of their Grilled Pork dish (the large dishes are enough to feed two FYI).  My brother-in-law went with the Khmer BBQ Platter (essentially a sampler of different meats).  Both came with white rice.  For a drink I got the Mango Boba (essentially a mango smoothie, but there were chewable items at the bottom of my drink that had the consistency of gummy bears).  The Boba was fantastic and tasted super fresh.  The gummy bear stuff at the bottom was weird, but tasted good too.  The Grilled Pork was also great and came with a sauce that almost has a sweet and spicy texture.  The in-law loved his platter which came with chicken wings, a couple of skewers of glazed meat, and some sliced seasoned beef.  I had seen some of the complaints about slow service about this place.  But while there was only one waitress tending to the room that night, we thought she was pretty on top of everything and we didn't have to wait long at all.  All totaled for the two main dishes, a Boba, an iced tea and a couple of waters was $28 before tip.  Totally doable.  In fact I couldn't find any item on their menu more expensive than $16 (including the large dishes).  I'll definitely be back to try more of their unique cuisine.  I've said it before, but if you find a restaurant in your neighborhood on Yelp with more than 100 reviews and polling an average of 4.5 stars, just go.  Even something as random and seemingly out of place as a Cambodian restaurant in Phoenix can open your eyes.",

I can honestly say that this is the only restaurant that can outshine a majority of the Cambodian restaurants in the LBC.   My favorite dish are their baiynchaiv crepes, curry with french bread, and their beef sticks. A bite of each is like biting into a grenade filled with uniquely distinct flavors, blended up in age old traditions and culture. For them to go all out and use REAL Cambodian ingredients says a lot about how serious they are.   Unlike 99% of the ethnic restaurants in AZ, Sekong seems to be more concerned about making proper Cambodian dishes and could care less about \"Americanizing\" their food  and excluding ingredients to save a nickel.   Kudos to the owners for representing the Khmer community very well... despite the whole \"nazi\" undertone.",

My fiancee was tipped off about this place by a chef at The Henry who said this was his favorite place for ethnic food.  We drove by it today while running errands and went back in the evening.  The place is kind of a hole-in-the-wall, but a nice hole.  The waiter (a young Cambodian man) was very pleasant and friendly.  My fiancee looked at Yelp reviews and saw pictures of different drinks and dishes.  We ordered a Basil Seed Drink (a banana-flavored drink with basil seeds which are inside small gelatinous balls), which was very refreshing and not too sweet.  The absolute bomb was the Honey Dew Soba, a smoothie made out of honey dew melon with tapioca balls in it.  It was truly heavenly, the best thing I ever had to drink.  The food was also fantastic; egg rolls, spring rolls, grilled pork, beef skewers.  On top of all this the prices were very reasonable.   You absolutely must try this hidden gem!",

I stopped by for lunch on Saturday, and had:  Spring rolls Katheaw Cha (large flat rice noodles stir fried with Katna broccoli, carrots, beef, and shrimp) Tamarind-based soup (forget the name, and I can't find it on the online menu - I think it had lemongrass and a little bit of coconut milk for creamy texture) Poat Ang (roasted corn dessert)  The pace of the meal was a little slower than what I'm used to, but the servers (brother & sister team) were warm/attentive, and the food was delicious. The flavors and spices used are very different and interesting - a welcome departure from the norm. I wouldn't mind skipping out on some of the common, \"fusion\" items like the spring rolls next time, and trying more dishes whose names I can't pronounce. Maybe I'll learn more Khmer, too - the owner taught me how to write my name when she came by to talk with us. Highly recommended! Try the Katheaw Cha.",

The music is quiet so its no problem having a conversation at a normal tone of voice.  The food is sometimes like Vietnamese good in that the spicing is subtle and not heavy or cloying.  Other times it is more Chinese with heavier (and delicious) sauces.  Portions are generous.  We will definitely be coming back!",

They offered to convert nearly any dish on their menu into a vegan alternative, and it was delicious. The spring rolls are really big, and they swapped their fish dipping sauce for a vegan version. We had the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup with tofu & veggie broth (just like the Vietnamese pho!) and the Katheaw Cha rice noodles with tofu instead of beef - AMAZING.

Very nice decoration inside. The waiter- I believe was the son of the owner, very polite and respectful. He greeted us like having guests over his house. Hubby and I ordered appetizer- Bok Lahong Salad- this was our favorite. Then for the main entry I ordered Hu Tieu Nam Vang- which was a very signature dish if you go to a Combodian restaurant. I personally did not like it, no flavor compare to how I make it. My hubby ordered the sausages dish..it was very good. Then for desert, we got the fried bananas...DELICIOUS!!! I also got a grilled corn....it was ok. Over all experiment- It was worth a try. I would go back with my Girl Friends.",

The restaurant is difficult to find because there isn't really a sign and parking is in the back.  But it is definitely worth a trip.",

Actually, have been there a few times now, tried something new each time, and each dish was better than the next. And love the fact its BYOB. Their corking fee is reasonable. The atmosphere is so laid back, but so cool. Just chill and comfy. The owner is really sweet too. This place is quickly becoming our \"go to\" place when we want low key, but incredibly fresh, tasty food at a beyond reasonable prices. We always share an app, each get entrees, and sometimes dessert too, and have yet to pay over $45.  Sekong By Night, we love you.",

My dinner companion was hoping there would be some adult beverages, but they do not sell alcohol yet. However it is BYOB with a corking fee. The second time i went with my Mom since she is a huge fan of different cuisines from around the world. We shared a cambodian coffee (yuuum and strong!) the crepes and ginger chicken stir fry. The crepes were both our favorite dish, i would still recommend the stir fried chicken though too! Both were delicious. Just a heads up though the chicken used was mostly dark meat, i love this cut of chicken but my mom prefers breast meat (she still thought it was yummy though). All of the meals i had there tasted so clean and fresh, a steal for the prices they have. Both times the servers were super friendly and nice. The time between the two shared dishes was perfect. The ambiance is very pleasant. I'll definitely be becoming a regular at this place.",

I went last night (Monday, October 21st), with 2 others I dragged out for dinner on a Monday...we all loved it!  I cannot wait to go back and try more things on the menu...I was so hungry it was hard to decide what I wanted.  The building is nice, food is awesome, and service was amazing (it was Monday, so it wasn't busy, but not just good service...staff was genuinely friendly like they appreciated my patronage).  Support Central Phoenix restaurants, this place definitely deserves our business to make sure it stays around for a long time.  I have to be honest; I was a little eager to put a face with the person who replies to so many reviews on here.  If he was my server last night, he knows service and how to make his customers feel welcome.  I love the fact that he takes enough pride in his business to address any concerns people feel the need to share with the world.",

I thought the portions were lunch-sized.  The soup was similar to a Vietnamese clear noodle soup.  The spring rolls are very earthy and minty.  I am not going to lie - I kept looking over the menu a dozen times because the selection was about 15 items long.  I didn't think the food was amazingly special, worth a long drive, but it was a decent, romantic place with yes, plenty of Asians and downtowners visiting.

    "text": "My fiance, friend and I decided to try Sekong By Night. My fiance is Cambodian and we were pleased when our friend found this place. We went with an open mind and were delighted with the experience.    The restaurant was small and quaint. The decor was modern and traditional at the same time. Pictures of Buddah adorned the walls and the entry way had musical instruments on display. I loved the fact that there were Cambodian books on all the tables, great idea especially because most people don't know about Cambodia. The place was very clean and comfortable.   The staff was amazing. Friendly, cordial and genuine. You could tell that this family run business really takes pride in what they do. Our server who is the sister of the owner came by and we had such a nice talk. Everyone came out to greet us, the owner, the owners mother. We all felt comfortable and welcome.    The food was DELICIOUS. They paid attention to detail and presented the food elegantly which added to the experience. We tried different dishes and shared family style. For an appetizer we ate Bok Lahong (papaya salad) and for our main courses we ate Lok Lak (which was beef cubes on a bed of lettuce), Somlaw Majou Manorah (pineapple soup) and Bai Morn (chicken and rice). Everything was so yummy and we finished with Jaek Kteeh (Banana Tapioca Pudding) which was to die for!    The only suggestion that I have is that Sekong By Night should be added to google or have a website so that people can find out more about the place. It's a little hard to find, so this might help.   Overall this was one of the best restaurant experiences that I have had. The staff was extremely friendly, food was authentic and delicious, the decor was exotic and inviting. Can't wait to go back and try out the other dishes.     Kat, Chan and Emily",

    "text": "Hooray for Yelp, otherwise I might never have found this place even though it's in my neighborhood.  And to be honest, even if I had literally found it, I might not have tried it.  But I'm so glad I did!  My husband and I went for dinner on a Wednesday night, and although not crowded, the restaurant was pretty busy, which I'm happy about. I want this place to stick around.  I've never had Cambodian food before, but as others have reported, it's a lot like Thai and Vietnamese food with French influences, which is not surprising.  I had the crepes.  They were filled with shrimp, ground pork and bean sprouts, and they came with mint, lettuce, cucumber slices, and cilantro.  I used my hands to make little crepe/lettuce rolls and then dipped them into the fish sauce.  I'm not certain that's how I was supposed to eat them, but it worked for me, and they were delicious!  My husband had the lak lok (I think that's what it was called--marinated beef pieces on a bed of greens with a side of rice), and he really like it too, although I think mine was better. . . .  We also each had a monster spring roll to start.  We really could have shared one, but I'm kind of glad we didn't.  Finally, we each had the iced jasmine tea.  It was very refreshing, with a floral undertone.  I'm already planning my next meal here.  There were so many things on the menu that looked yummy.  Two final comments:  Yes, service was slow, but not horribly so.  And the food was so good and fresh that all was forgiven once it arrived.  And this is not a \"sketchy neighborhood\"!  It's central Phoenix, not Scottsdale, and frankly that's exactly why I live here.",

    "text": "This is my first review, so bare with me.  This place is very good (4.5 overall).  The service was pretty good (3.5 loses some on missing food and insanely hot inside at first, but cooled down eventually), although we were the only people in the place, it was about 5pm on a Friday afternoon.  I had read all the other 10 or so reviews here on this place and thought it was worth a try.  So why should you keep reading?  I'm Asian, yeah, seriously.  My mom is a crazy good cook, all flavors - every Chinese style, Vietnamese, Thai, and Cambodian.  My family is 1st generation immigrants so I've eaten pretty authentic dishes.  The owner shares the same background as my family except she's Cambodian and my family is Chinese living in Cambodia.  We chatted for a bit with the female owner and exchanged a couple stories.  I also let her witness my terrible Cambodian, which my family also gets a kick out of, our main dialect is Cantonese.  Let's get into the food.... Jasmine iced tea, very good.  I typically like mine stronger, but not a real complaint.  We had the spring rolls first, the non fried version.  Very good and the fish sauce is also delicious.  Personally I like pork belly in mine, but chicken and shrimp is good also.  For the main course; I had katheaw soup - steak, tripe, and meatballs.  This is the only place I know of in the valley that has japquie (sp), fried bread sticks, or what they call in Cali and Seattle - Chinese donut sticks.  This to me is the real way to eat noodle soup!  What is maybe a little lacking is the fresh herbs and bean sprouts, oh and get me some tendon in the soup.  I actually didn't get the fried bread as part of my soup meal, but I did order a side so my wife could try, so not a big deal.  My wife had the katheaw cha, stir fried rice noodles and beef, and we also tried the pate & pork meatball sandwich.  The stir fry noodles were good, a lot of garlic, so be ready for that, but I don't mind.  The sandwich was excellent and this will now become our regular spot for these type of sandwiches.  We also had dessert; banana tapioca pudding.  Sorry Mom, Sekong's is better=).  There wasn't Bahn Cha (sp?) on the menu when we went, I would like to try theirs sometime though.  There are a few things on a Cambodian menu I would want to see also, but overall I'm pretty impressed.  The son was our waiter and we shared what we considered our favorite dishes that weren't on the menu, he likes the same desserts as my brother and oddly enough they look a lot a like! Price is good and the food is very believable, we will be back again soon and will bring friends to this hidden gem.",

    "text": "I give it a 5 for value, for this price point the food is amazing, and for overall experience, the decor is nice and travel books about cambodia are on most tables are a neat touch.  While I have been using Yelp for atleast two years, this is my first review! That should suggest something about this place. My husband and I went for dinner last night and on the drive home discussed our reviews. He gave it a four - but only because he suggested the need for additional wait staff.  Back to my five, Value: we had 3 courses, all delicious and and wonderfully presented for less than $40 with a good tip included! Drinks: we had the house ice tea (very clean), basil seed drink (crazy fun) and with dessert  espressowith condenced milk (sweet and strong). Food: Spring roll (good)& egg roll (top notch); the Baiynchaiv crepes(at first bland but once we played with the side -delicious- so here is a hint, we took the mintand cilantro and wrapped it in the lettuce and dipped that in the sauce and ate it with the crepe) and the Katheaw Cha flat wide noodles with beef and shrimp (the beef is very tender- delicious); grilled corn (crazy fun and a perfect finish). Service: As others have pointed out this is a two person show that has only been open 6 months- there is one young man waiting all tables... so prepare yourself to wait for a table and for the food to come out slower than other places. Personally, that made me love the place even more. It was a meal that progressed at a leisured pace and gave us time to read the books at our table and learn a little about Cambodia. It is a double edge sword to write this review because I want this restaurant to succeed- they are doing everything right... but with more customers comes crowds and we anticipate an increase to a more accurate price point. So when you go be patient and enjoy this lovely experience, tip your waiter well and join me in the hope that this business is able to grow without changing a thing:)",

    "text": "Finally! A restaurant in Phoenix that serves my ideal banh mi! Technically its not a Vietnamese sandwich, but it does taste a lot like one. In the search for a wholesome banh mi, I've gone to about 6 Phoenix Vietnamese restaurants in the past year and have been disappointed in their banh mi's every time. Either the bread wasn't fresh enough, there was too little meat or there wasn't enough asian mayo, none were good enough for my liking. Today, I decided to try Sekong's Noumpang Saiko Ang, which is a grilled beef Cambodian sandwich. This sandwich was fabulous! The bread was just the right amount of crispy outside/soft center, the beef was tasty and tender, and the best part, enough mayo that has been so lacking in my previous endeavors. I would say the only thing missing is fresh jalapenos, which I am sure they would add if I request it. Now that this heavenly sandwich has touch my lips, my only hope is that the fresh ingredients remain consistent. I also want to come back and taste their beef noodle soup that looks a lot like pho too.  For the people that have not been here before, this place is not easy to find. I drove here with a GPS and still passed it. Its right next to the auto place, so if you see that you are very close.",

We walked into a door we thought was the front door but ended up being the kitchen.  We were welcomed and guided to the dining room by the kitchen staff.  The dining room was decorated nice with a stage full of instruments which made me wonder if they ever host music but didn't ask.   The waiter was extremely kind and the service was excellent.  We ordered 2 noodle dishes one with a flat noodle, shrimp, broccoli and beef and very good!  The second had a round noodle and beef.  We also ordered one rice dish that had a boiled shredded chicken on top of a fried rice.  The sauce to pour over the top was the same as the spring roll dipping sauce.  Although it was good I wouldn't order that for myself again.  Maybe a nice mild dish for those with simple taste.  Sorry to say that I failed at taking down the names of any of the dishes.  We also ordered spring rolls. What a great deal on spring rolls!  Everything was very fresh, delicious and the prices makes this a place we can return to feed a family at a decent price!     I'm a huge Thai food fan and this did remind me of a less seasoned versions of Thai.  I'm anxious to try the other dishes to see if there are some that are with more spice and flavor.   Will return often!  Worth a trip to visit if you're not in central phoenix.",

When we arrived (around 6:30), we were the only guests in the dining room--well, it was Halloween, after all--but within 30 minutes nearly every table was occupied. I can see why. The food is delicious and very reasonably priced. For a $10- or $12-dish, you get an enormous portion. We ordered the lemongrass soup and one beef dish, and even though we ate a ton, there was still some to take home! The dishes were delicious, the food was served piping hot where appropriate, and the servers were upbeat and attentive. I'm so happy to discover Cambodian food--a bit like Thai, a bit like Vietnamese, but all its own. Best thing: you get so much FLAVOR without it being way too spicy to taste anything. Nice homey atmosphere, low-key and authentic-feeling. I will definitely be back and will be recommending that others try this place.",

When my husband asked if I wanted to try Cambodian food- I had reservations because I had never heard anyone say that they had eaten Cambodian food in Arizona...and I certainly had never had anything classified as Cambodian food either.  We tried it anyway based on such a high amount of great reviews.  We went for lunch and I couldn't stop thinking about my meal afterwards.  It's also super inexpensive... the egg rolls are $1!  And worth every cent and more.  The sauce that comes with the rolls was really tasty.  The place is unassuming from the road and to be honest, I watched someone else try several doors before finding the right one to enter...thank goodness.  There are like 3 doors.    I had the mi cha, my mother-in-law had a tilapia dish and my husband had a pho dish.  We all thought our meals were really good and cooked perfectly.  I also had the Jasmine green tea- simple yet refreshing.  After we left yesterday, we both agreed we couldn't wait to go back- it's that good.  You should try this place out!",

I've tried a few dishes (baiynchaiv, loat cha, and something else) and a couple drinks (mango smoothie and cafe thuckdokdo). My favorite so far is the loat cha and cafe thuckdokdo! My only complaint for food/drinks is that the smoothie is a bit sweet. The service is great and it helps that my dad can speak Cambodian with the staff. The decor is fairly nice and they have quite a bit of decor representing Cambodian culture. The atmosphere is nice, bathroom's clean, but the parking lot is just a tad hard to get into because of the somewhat busy street you have to turn in from. We'll be back again sometime.",

It's a great spot for adventurous eaters, but at the same time...the flavors are still very familiar as you can easily order BBQ platters if you're bringing hesitant guests.    I've been here thrice now, and everything I have tasted has been phenomenal! Just like a True hidden gem, it's a little difficult to find their private parking lot.  It's a mom & pop type of space with some very friendly owners.   I highly recommend getting some freshly prepared egg rolls (ended up ordering it twice on the first visit because they were so scrumptious) and a honeydew boba.  You can't go wrong with the loat cha (rice noodles with beef) or the kebobs, but I've also had the intestine-filled pho, and you can't beat that fully flavored and deep broth!  Be patient when it comes to your food coming out, since they have a pretty small kitchen...but get ready for a flavor explosion.   Now they just need to update their website with a menu.",

    "text": "First time eating Cambodian food. I am not sure what it's supposed to taste like so it's hard to say if this is what cambodian food is....  Small, quiet place. Entrance was non-initutive to us for some reason, we walked in the kitchen. It's the door on the left if anyone was curious.   On a Monday at lunch, we were the only people in there around noon.   I didn't know what to order but I like shrimp so I went for it. I went  for the Shrimp Ling rice combo. It comes with soup, rice and a pickled salad.   The dish comes on a nice square plate so it makes the food 50x fancier just because it's on a square plate. Lots of shrimp in my plate ~ about 10ish and they're large. The shrimp was grilled and it tasted good but I wouldn't call it amazingly good that I was in love. I ate it and I like it but I thought to myself 'What is Cambodian food because the flavors don't seem unique? It seems like they grilled it in some soy sauce, maybe sugar, added more salt and maybe one or two other spices.\" FYI - There's bunch of green onions in the shrimp, I think they add that more flavor. They aren't chopped into small pieces, it's like the whole stem but I ate everything. I always eat everything - I don't waste my food (it's almost like a sin not to finish your food unless you take it home... so nevermind).  The pickled salad was refreshing. I like the soup, it was lukewarm and it reminded me of a Chinese wintermelon homecooked soup. It's like a mixed of Chinese style chicken broth with Vietnamese beef broth without the saltiness and msg. Adding the green onions to the soup definitely makes it 50x better as well - WOOHOO.   My dish was $8 - pretty good price. Thumbs up to that!  Overall, would I go back? Eh - I don't know. I need to try other Cambodian places or maybe I should just have googled about it...maybe Vietnamese food is better? Apparently, the countries are located near each other so it's similar to Vietnamese food.",

Keep in mind it can be very difficult to find any Cambodian restaurants so try it. As some one who lived among the Cambodian people, ate in their homes, learnd their history, language, traditions, attended weddings as if I were family, this place is quite authentic.  They also have pride the the Kampuchean or current day Cambodian heritage by the interior, decoration, numerous travel books, & informative literature placed in the seating area for anyone to take a look at.  Go try the food, it will make you happy.",

They both had really great flavors and I think it's a meal we'd enjoy again.    We brought our 19 month old but they didn't have a booster seat or high chair.  The service was decent though.  I like how each table had tourism information about Cambodia.    I can't really say \"if you like Cambodian food come here!\" b'c as I said before, I don't know how good it is compared to other places but as far as Asian restaurants go, if you are feeling adventurous, try it out!  There's definitely food selection there that's not too weird.",

If you enjoy taking in all elements of your dining experience then this is your spot!  I usually order the lemongrass soup or the curry soup. Large portion with sticky white rice provided to add if you choose. Both are outstanding. I've had the student noodles and the skewers. The spring rolls and egg rolls are fresh and substantial. The experience is reminiscent of being in someone's home, with Mom cooking.  Highly recommend",

This place is a little hard to find, I drove passed it on accident. Parking is in the back of the building. Place looks a little sketchy but it's safe.   Food was extremely fragrant and packed with flavor. My girlfriend and I ordered a few dishes to share together. We ordered eggrolls and spring rolls to start. & we ordered the chicken lemongrass stir fry & the BBQ combination platter. Everything that we ordered was pretty amazing. We ran out of rice and they gave us a refill for no extra charge. They offer a selection of different drinks but the soda's are either from glass bottles or cans, not fountain.   Service was kind of slow. One of our servers had a hard time understanding us while ordering but we were very patient with her.",

We've met almost every month for over five years.  We have only repeated one other restaurant.     Noticeably different this visit was the speed at which the food was served!  Wow!  Big time improvement over our first event.     I enjoyed the BBQ sampler plate.   Whew, talk about mouth watering deliciousness!  More food than I could eat in one sitting so I had the leftovers for lunch the next day.    For my fellow Yelpers, here is a driving/Parking tip:  turning into the parking lot is tight and close to the corner of the building.   There is no sign on the building that is easily visible from the street. Slow down as you approach because you can easily miss the turn.   If you miss it and think you can make the block north of the restaurant, you will get turned around in dead end street hell.  (Don't ask me how I know).  Ease off the gas and make the turn the first time.  Return Factor: 80%",

Fresh spring rolls were great and on par with what you would get at a good Vietnamese place. Also had the Jackfruit sweet rice desert. It's kind of like the mango sweet rice you would get from a Thai place, but they're wrapped in banana leaf and more \"sticky\". The stand out dish was my vegetarian noodle soup, which is a bit like Pho, but a little different spices. Even though it was a vegetable broth, it had a great flavor and depth like a beef broth. Comes with assorted vegetables and cilantro on the side, similar to how Pho is served. It was the best veggie soup I have had yet! My friend had Bai Morn which is chicken breast with a seasoned rice that she loved. I'm definitely going back to try some other things on their menu.",

    "text": "I was recommended this place by a friend of mine so my roommate and I decided to try it out for dinner. It was such a good recommendation! I started off with the basil seeds and grass jelly drink. I get nostalgic with grass jelly since my mom used to give me bowls of it when I was little for dessert. It came nicely diced up into little tiny pieces with the basil seeds in the drink. The drink had a light sweetness to it that wasn't over doing it. It's hard for me to explain the flavor but definitely try grass jelly at least once in your life.   My roommate got an egg roll to start and she insisted that I try it since it was so good. Omg it tasted so similar to my mom's! This is a rarity. Most egg rolls I try are complete garbage and filled with cabbage and really nothing else. This had meat, carrots, and glass noodle from what I can tell from just looking at it, but knowing how my mom makes them there is probably secret ingredients in there that are well hidden.   For dinner, we both got a bbq meat platter. They forgot to make both so we had to share one while they made the second one, which we then shared. The platter came with 3 different dishes and a side of jasamine rice and pickled carrots and cabbage. The meat dishes were 2 large bbq bbq wings, bbq chicken, and beef skewers. The beef skewers were ground, mixed with tons of delicious seasonings, and reformed before cooking. They were delicious! They tasted like they had lemongrass in them and I love lemongrass. The bbq chicken was a little on the drier side but I wouldn't say dry. It was marinated in something before cooking and it's flavoring was subtle but added to the chicken flavor. It was my least favorite of the three but I thought it was still good. The bbq wings. Omg. I don't know how they make the marinate or sauce or whatever they put on it before BBQing but I always love that flavor when I have had it in the past before. The was a subtly sweet, smoky flavor with a hint of something something. The wings were super juicy. Having to pick between the wings and the beef skewers, it's hard to decide which one I like better. If I had to, I would probably pick the beef skewers, but by a thin hair.   For dessert, I ordered the jackfruit and sticky rice. I've never had jackfruit sticky rice before. I'm used to the Thai style mango sticky rice so had to try this. I was surprised when the dish came out and they were wrapped in banana leaves. I thought the jackfruit was going to be fresh not cooked or mixed in with the rice. I wss still excited though. The sticky rice had stings of coconut running through it with pieces of the jackfruit mixed in. The rice was slightly sweet but the perfect amount for me. I loved every bite of this.   I would say service was a little on the slow side but I expect this from small family run restaurants. Really cute place on the inside. It clearly used to be a mexican restaurant before based on the outside lol   Will definitely come back.",

Amazingly flavored in every bite. The rice is from Cambodia served fresh with your dish. I officially joined the clean plate club that night.  The dining experiences after lead me to ordering the same thing for a while. Then I dared to try something new and was pleased by the ginger beef. It melts right in your mouth. Or the Beef lok lak which is a salad but also comes with rice. My friend is hooked on the egg rolls that they make fresh daily and the Beef and Shrimp noodles.   Everything I have tried has been amazing. No complaints at all. Now this place is run by three people. A family business with mom and pop cooking while the son serves. Service will be slow but worth the wait. You can sip on some tea or the variety of drink options they serve. Perfect place for a date or just to have a casual conversation.",

Our new surprise and delight is the bok lahong salad; green papaya & salted crab. The fresh tomatoes will sooth your mouth if you order it hot. We also like the BBQ Pork Chop and Lemongrass Stir Fry. The kitchen is run my Lakana In and her son-in-law Det does an amazing job waiting tables. I recommend this for lunch or dinner! It's amazing!!",

Really good, like chia seed drink.  Got a spring roll while waiting for amok fish. Spring roll was big and delicious.  The fish comes chopped up with Kreung spices . I'm not sure but I think there is an egg mixed and baked. It's really very good.  Great food, great ambiance, fast service.   I still had room for dessert so I tried the jackfruit. It was not so good. Taste was okay but texture too fibrous. They still get 5 stars.   I want to come back soon and try the lemon grass soup.",

Lok Lak beef and fins amok, two of my favorite dishes when I traveled in Cambodia five years ago, were not served -- very disappointing.  We ordered the student noodles, lemon grass stir fry (beef), and the grilled fish, and some grass jelly drink. The flavor and seasoning of The student noodles were absolutely spot-on. And we all liked the lemon grass stir fry. However, the grilled fish and the grass jelly drink were disappointing, far below our expectation.   Next time when we go, we hope that they have all the ingredients to make fish amok and lok lak beef ...",

Got to meet the owner and exchanged our typical Cambodian greetings. Being Cambodian myself, it'll be rude if you don't try to get to know your own country folks!! Represent!!   As far as the food, I went with the Beef Lok Lak with Veggies, my Sifu went with the Beef Noodle Soup and my Kim Sifu went with the Chicken Ginger Stir-Fry. Being that I'm Khmer myself and often cooked these dishes at home, I have got to say, their food here is marvelous. All the food tasted very very good. The sauce used in the dish was just right. Not too salty or bland. I didn't even have to use any dipping sauce for my Lok Lak. It was just perfectly made. Since I don't eat rice anymore, the owner was very accommodating with an extra serving of veggies in place of the rice.   If I'm ever back in Phoenix again, I'll surely visit this jewel of a place again.",

That won't be the case again as it is quickly gaining momentum as our favorite. My husband had the Chang beer and I had the jasmine iced tea, both very good drinks. We ordered the Kathiev Cha and Student noodles, both were amazing. The Kathiev Cha was a little more on the savory side and the student noodles were very saucy and a little more spicy. Both were excellent and great dishes to share.  This is a family owned and run business and they treat you like you've stepped into their home as a special guest. The food, service and atmosphere make it 5 stars in my book.",

Located in an older building does not take away from cleanliness as I had no problem eating there. They have a small staff doesn't detract from their service. Our waiter was great in making recommendations and answering questions. It may take a few extra minutes to get your order, but well worth it because it is all cooked fresh! We started with spring rolls and egg rolls. Both were great, the egg rolls flavorful with a flakey shell, the spring roll delish as well but huge! The main course was fantastic! I chose the stir fry with chicken and it was so smooth I want to go back again just for that! There are several things I want to try on their menu, and I will be back for sure! Great little find!",

I was in the mood for something Asian/not Chinese and found reviews on here and thought I'd give it a try.  I live about 6 blocks from the restaurant and have for 6 or 7 years and NEVER saw it until I went to look for it.  Whoever wrote that there is practically no signage was absolutely right, you park in the back and the entrance is in the back of the building.    I was a later-in-the-evening diner (maybe 9:15pm?) and when I got there, only 1 table was occupied (this was a weeknight).  I ordered one of their soups (which are basically all the same except for the choice of which meat you have them put in) and it was fairly good and enhanced with hot sauce.  I also ordered beef skewers and their specialty pork, which I was a bit skeptical about but for the reviews on here.  The beef skewers were what others on here have mentioned:  bland, and actually sort of hard to confirm that it was beef.  The pork was perhaps the best pork I have ever eaten in a restaurant.  It was grilled and sliced thin, kind of like what you would see with a flatiron or flank steak.  The edges were somehow carmelized which added a welcome and delicious infusion of flavor.  I focused on that and let everything else fall by the wayside.  As others have mentioned, the service was slow; definitely slower than what I would have wanted, and indifferent.  He may be working on improving his language skills which might account for the sense of indifference.",

    "text": "Over the past few years we've been fortunate enough to have so many tasty and diverse Asian restaurants open. Some of my personal favorites are Soi4 for up-scaled Thai street food, Northeaster Thailand delights at Thai-E and chewy hand pulled noodles at China Magic Noodle House just to name a few. Now there is one more specialty to add to the fold, Sekong by Night specializing in Cambodian fare.  Sekong has taken home to the old Fellini's Pizza space at 13th Place and Indian School. They've taken the space and turned it into a charming dining room that's comfortable and tasteful. Cambodian artwork graces each table along with beautiful patterned table cloths. Family owned son Yutheana In runs the front of the house while his mom Lakhana In cooks all of the delicious Khmer style dishes.  You'll quickly notice that many of the dishes might appear like Thai food, well reverse that, Thai food is heavily influenced by Cambodian cooking though the later is definitely not as spicy. However you'll also notice a Colonial and Vietnamese influence on the menu starting with their fresh Spring Rolls. Chewy rice paper is wrapped around a salad of vegetables and shrimp, complete with a delicately sweet flavored fish sauce.  If you've ever heard of Banh Mi you'll know this famous Vietnamese style sandwich. Its Cambodia cousin called Num Pang, though simply labeled as \"sandwiches\" on the menu, is just as tasty. They take a large slab of crust French baguette, sourced from Lee's Sandwiches in Chandler, and pile it high with lemon grass flavored beef, pickled veggies, cilantro and a squirt of siracha chile sauce. I think once word gets out how good Sekong's sandwiches are; there could be a line out the door.  Other hits included sweetened stir fried beef Lok Lak Beef and another dish called Loat Cha. The earthworm shaped rice noodles were so chewy and addictive Id order them every time.  Service was on the slow side since they've only just opened but I assure you, it was worth the wait.",

    "text": "Cambodian is not a cuisine that comes up for most people during the \"what to have for dinner\" discussion, so it's not surprising that this restaurant is still a \"hidden\" gem (though it does always seem to have customers, which makes me happy).   I'm not sure why Cambodian food hadn't really caught on. If you consider where it is on a map (or discretely pull up Google to learn where it is on a map), you'll see that it's wedged between two countries whose cuisines have done quite well for themselves (Thailand and Vietnam). Cambodian food has similarities to both Thai and Vietnamese food, as well as its own signature dishes.  Now, I'm no Cambodian food expert (contrary to what I may have previously led you to believe) but I have enjoyed everything I've had from Reathrey Sekong so I think it's probably a good place to get it. Their basil seed drink is something everyone should try. I've also enjoyed their beef noodle soup (I don't think they call it pho but it's similar with a bit more garlic) especially the large amount of tripe. I plan on eating my way through this entire menu, especially the desserts, and I doubt I'll ever be disappointed.   Finally, I enjoy a good owner response and Reathrey Sekong really delivers on that front so bonus points for character.",

I also enjoyed both the banana tapioca and the jackfruit & sweet rice for dessert. The boba smoothies are big enough for two to share (my parents had mango).  A great choice when you are not pressed for time. Sometimes it takes a little extra time to be served and we did have a few points of confusion before we received all of our food. Still, everyone is so kind, friendly and lighthearted that there was no tension at all. Highly recommended, this is a restaurant we will come back to whenever we are back in Phoenix!",

The Lemongrass chicken was bursting with flavor, Bai Cha (fried rice with choice of meat), Grilled Beef Skewers, Cha Kreung (lemongrass meat-your choice), Grilled Pork and Katheaw Cha (rice noodles with meat-your choice) were ALL delicious. Our tastebuds thanked us for choosing Reathrey Sekong for dinner tonight! Can't wait to go back!",

Reading all the 5 stars review I knew immediately that this is something I would love. Sure enough my first visit there today was everything I expected and more. The place is very clean. Our server was extremely friendly ( not sure if it was the Sekong By Night Nazi) And the food was fresh and very tasty.  We had the Spring Rolls as appetizer and boy those are yummy. I ordered the Curry Chicken and my partner had the Shrimp Ling. Both dishes again were fresh and very tasty. I will be back for more and can't wait to explore the rest of their menu.  BTW, I admire the owner brutal honesty, people who  give this place a 1 star are just naive and should stick to the McDonalds down the street. Why do you need to slander a business just because your taste buds are not used to freshly prepared food???  Two thumbs up!!",

    "text": "After reading all these raving reviews, we were excited to try Reathrey Sekong.  I had the basil seed drink, green papaya salad and the chicken wings, my husband chose the honeydew boba, egg rolls and the pork chops.   Pros:  - drinks were very tasty and refreshing  - the food was well seasoned  - service was friendly  Cons:  - As I wasn't able to find a menu online, I had oriented myself at the picture here from 2011. Even though most of the menu items are still the same, the prices have doubled for almost everything. The papaya salad was $13 ($5 in 2011), chicken wings and pork chops both $13 ($6.5). We payed $54 for the both of us.  - Where one pork chop was nicely charred, the other one was very pale.  - The chicken wings were tasty but VERY dark which made them a little dry.  - Service was basically nonexistent. The two servers seemed to be new and only came out of the kitchen to bring food out and immediately hid back inside.  - The light above our table was very bright in the otherwise dimly lit room. Remember when you used to tell horror stories with a flash light under your chin? Well, I very much felt the same way just that the light came from above. I was in a spotlight the whole night, blinded by its brightness.  All in all, it was an ok experience but definitely not a highlight.",

Since it was a Friday evening, the place was packed but we were seated immediately. We ordered basil seed drinks, spring rolls, green mango grilled fish, and a beef dish with a name I could not remember but which was described in the menu as a special preparation. The basil seed drink was pleasant and refreshing. After an understandably lengthy wait (Friday evening, remember) we got the entrees but did not get the spring rolls. The beef dish (see the photo I posted) featured a sliced, minimally-seasoned grilled beef that came with a very pungent sauce on the side, and raw vegetables. Perhaps this is the way the vegetables are supposed to be served with the dish and the accompanying pungent sauce, but I didn't care for cabbage wedges, whole string beans, and eggplant slices which are raw. And the beef was underwhelming, even with the very pungent sauce applied to it. This is one dish I know I will not be ordering again. The grilled fish with shredded green mango was quite good. The server apologized when we told her that we waited for but never got the spring rolls. Hopefully the next visit  will be an experience on par with my previous visits.",

There is not much seating, which wasn't a probably thankfully because it was only use when we went. The menu is not very large, but this was a good thing because I had no clue what to get. I actually went on yelp to help me decide . It seems like everyone orders the student noodles so I went with that as well as beef skewers and an egg roll. The egg roll was fantastic (I also really enjoy egg rolls). The beef skewers were fine, not sure if I would order again but they were by no means bad. Just not my cup of tea. The student noodles however, OMG. They were so good!! I had it with chicken which was a good choice because the chicken was very good. It had something most similar to a bbq sauce on it. The noodles were in a small amount of (I think) broth. I would highly recommend the student noodles!  Besides the food, the service was awesome as was the parking.",

We ordered the Lemongrass Chicken and it was really good. Similar to what my mother in law makes from Laos. I was a bit surprised the portion was a bit smaller than I am used to and it was priced a little bit higher.   Presentation of the food was great, not on a plain white plate but a nice colored plate arranged neatly.   The ambiance is nice, it has a relaxing feel to the whole place.

I am torn on giving this place a high rating my first time here but I will come back and give them another try.   The place is adorable, esthetically pleasing, quaint and kind of romantic and a bit whimsical. The service is extremely friendly and inviting. This is why I'm giving it 4 stars. If it was solely on the food it would be less.   I came for the pork dumpling soup and they didn't have any so I pouted like a child and reluctantly ordered the chicken soup and asked for veggies. The soup was bland no flavor at all. The vegetables were crispy and bright green, fresh but didn't do much to add flavor to the broth. The soup size was large and plenty with rice noodles, shredded chicken and chicken meatballs none of it had any flavor. It hadn't been simmered long enough nor salted/seasoned well enough. I added cilantro, lime and hoisin sauce and chili sauce until it turned bright red and then it was more palatable.   My partner ordered the student noodles with pork. The pork was savory, full flavor. I could eat and entire bowl. The noodles were cooked perfectly and were good. Still the flavor was a little lacking.   I will come back during dinner service to try the food after a long day of simmering and maybe have a better luck. I am not ready to dismiss this place and have high hopes!",

We got the summer and egg roll, and the ginger stir fry and grilled fish for mains. Everything was pretty average.

I wasn't really sure as to what to expect, people have told me it's a little fusion between Thai and Vietnamese food, but I don't think it would be appropriate to classify it as that. Cambodian flavors are quite complex but still delicious! Although the proprietors were very nice, it did take a little bit for our order to be taken (a little disappointing given that we were only one of two parties in the whole restaurant at the time). Nonetheless the taste of the food makes up for it.  I wanted to try the amok fish, but unfortunately they were out of the ingredients required to make the dish on the day that I came. I ended up trying a beef salad type of dish and it was delicious. It was a nice refreshing dish full of great flavors. I also had the fresh spring roll for an appetizer and it was like a vietnamese spring roll, except the dipping sauce was different. Overall it was a good experience (but the wait time could have been better), the decor is nice, and the music played is great. Overall I'd definitely come back here to try some of their other dishes.  PLUS: They serve coconut juice out of a real coconut.",

    "text": "Solid little family run restaurant tucked away in PHX (and by tucked away I mean I totally missed the parking lot!! - so nervous drivers out there: there's an AWESOMELY convenient lot & don't settle for street parking).  I'd highly recommend the BBQ platter to get a good sampling of the meats. I wish I'd gotten the seafood platter as well, but next time! Opted for the steak & thuck prahok but the dipping sauce was very strong - like 1000x stronger than concentrated fish paste (as the server warned). So if you don't have a very adventurous palette for fish - I'd stay away from that specifically. No worries though bc there are a TON of other delicious items to try out though!  For dessert, I was torn between the choices, but jackfruit sticky rice was an awesome decision!",

We again were a party of 12, and did have a reservation time of 6:30, but some of us showed up around 6pm, which Reathrey Sekong didn't mind.  Since we were already seated, and we knew it was a small kitchen, we just starting placing our orders in rounds, that way we didn't flood the kitchen with everyone ordering at the same time. This actually worked out well.  After checking out the menu I went with the Cambodian beef skewers with pickled veggies, I wasn't sure how the pickled veggies would taste, but I actually loved them, they had a perfect flavor. The beef was seasoned perfectly and just what I wanted. Next time I am getting the lok lak beef!   Again, service was outstanding!  Another great meal for the ISCUYE!",

Every single dish was so flavorful and delicious. I have never had Cambodian food. I was not disappointed. We ordered about 7 different dishes and they were all excellent! I would order any of them again. The lemongrass stir fry chicken is amazing. The fried rice was great. The fried egg rolls were perfect. There was a beef salad we ordered that was so fresh. You can't go wrong with anything you order. Highly recommend.  Update 8/31/19: Just returned from our second dine in experience here. It was just as amazing and delicious as our first time. We ordered new entrees and loved them!! We have yet to try any dish we didn't like. Our new goal is to try everything on the menu at least once. Highly recommend!!",

    "text": "To start, I am a tad bit surprised this restaurant is so highly rated. I came to this restaurant for a friend's birthday dinner on a Wednesday evening around 6 PM. I was pleasantly surprised since it was not too busy. We had a party of 8 and were immediately seated in their side room at a big round table. I was excited to see that they had such a table to accommodate large parties, but I instantly got worried that the service maybe wouldn't be as great. My fears became a reality as it took a while for a server to come in and answer questions about the menu and then to come back and take our orders.  Since this is a small family-owned restaurant, I expected the food to come out slower with such a large party, but it still exceeded the time I thought it should take to prepare our dishes. When our food started arriving, it came in odd waves. Between the first person's food and the last person's food arriving was about fifteen minutes total. As we didn't want the food getting cold, everyone ate as their dish came out and by the time my food arrived, some individuals were almost done with their meal. Another issue I had was that the portion sizes for the price was higher than I would have anticipated. The food was all okay, but for the price, I don't know that I would come back to try anything else. I was able to try multiple dishes: the student noodles with chicken, Lok lak beef, and lemongrass chicken stir fry (three of their most popular dishes) and bai cha with beef (the fried rice). If you do decide to try this place, do be warned that it is really easy to miss on Indian School because there are no clear signs outside the tiny restaurant.",

They tell you ahead of time that it takes about twenty minutes to prepare the fish. They were out of the light beer but the stout was still refreshing. The restaurant has a relaxing ambiance and it felt like I could sit there all day. It'd be a great place for 2-4 people to go since it's pretty small. I'm looking forward to my next visit!",

I ordered the student noodles, by far the best dish out of the 4 entree's we ordered. We ordered the Bai Cha (chicken rice) strange taste, yet very bland. Ordered the Kathiev Cha, flat noodles stir fry.  For appetizers we got the egg roll, fresh salad roll, chicken wings and the beef skewers.  Everything \"looked\" way better than it tasted. To me it was too sweet, and no \"fresh flavors\" it needed a bright flavor to conquer the sweetness.   I won't be back, but again, I don't want to be unfair to the authenticity of this type of food.

We were pleasantly surprised at the ease of parking, although we almost drove by (it was a quick, tight turn on the west end of the building into the parking area behind).  We both loved the peacefulness of the place and the decor.  There were only a few other occupied tables which is rare for a Friday lunch. We were actually able to converse. My friend ordered the spring roll to start.  It was large and fresh and stuffed with shrimp. She also had a chicken soup with rice noodles (Katheaw Saikmorn), which she said was delicious!  I ordered the Katheaw Cha, which had large, delightfully chewy, tender noodles and perfectly cooked beef, shrimp, and vegetables. I loved the sauce, too. The waitstaff was very helpful and polite, and we felt welcomed. They also refilled our refreshing Jasmine iced teas throughout our meal.  I would definitely recommend Sekong By Night.  I can't wait to bring friends and family here!",

Back to the review, the food here is good. Though an overall small establishment it is able the accompany a group of people  no larger than 30 customers. I believe Cambodian and Thai food share the same qualities when it comes to taste but has its own distinctions. The bbq platter is one I shall recommend as the meat is succulent, sweet, and of course tasty. Just a bit pricey when it comes to overall quality. If you are ever in the Phoenix area or searching for quality Cambodian food this is the place to be!",

The wait was SERIOUSLY long for the food for the amount of people that were at the restaurant when my wife and I visited.  The restaurant was clean and tidy however when we were there there was quite a bit of smoke coming from the kitchen area that seeped into the main restaurant (I think they had some ventilation issues).  Both the egg rolls were super small and they served it with sweet and sour sauce (not the traditional fish sauce), and the grilled pork was tasty but portion wise small for the price.  Overall, it was worth the visit but will most likely not worth another visit.",

    "text": "I admittedly don't know much about Cambodia. I know I want to see Angkor Wat at some point in my life, but that's about as far as my knowledge extends. When I saw there was a local Cambodian restaurant here in Phoenix, I was intrigued and wanted to stop by to broaden my knowledge base.   We walked into Reathrey Sekong on a Friday evening at 6:30pm and were sat immediately. For a 4-1/2 star restaurant, that impressed me. Especially since we had just left another place after seeing a horde of people standing outside.   The inside is small but charming to say the least. I ordered the Cambodian iced coffee which was recommended in other reviews. Greatness. I thought it was going to be too sweet, but it wasn't, the mix of coffee and condensed milk was perfect.   I ordered the large serving of the Cambodian BBQ Platter for dinner. It was basically a big plate o' meat that consisted of sliced beef, grilled beef skewers and grilled chicken wings. It's also served with a bowl of white rice. Excellent.   The two beef offerings were cooked so that they were still tender and the flavor was awesome. The wings were on another level. Probably in the top 5 of best wings I've ever eaten.   The only issue I experienced was in the order the items were served. I waited for what I thought was a while before my coffee came out but it was okay. I figured they were just waiting for it to brew. My coffee came out, but my wife's drink (coconut smoothie with boba) didn't come out for a few minutes later.  Then the same thing happened with our food. My food came out and hers didn't for about 3-5 minutes later. It wasn't a huge deal, but it's just awkward when you're sitting there with your food and your eating companion is sitting there watching you, twiddling their thumbs. She wasn't actually twiddling her thumbs. Does anyone do that anymore? Anyway... you get the point.   That was my only qualm. Other than that, this place was excellent. If Reathrey Sekong is any indication of the deliciousness that awaits in Cambodia... I can't get there fast enough.",

Tucked away next to a car shop the parking is and entrance is in the back but once you walk in its definitely a whole different environment you stepped in from. Its really flourished in old Cambodian decor which gives it a really great ambiance. If this is your first time and you're trying to play it safe definitely get the roast beef and thuck prahok! I'm only halfway kidding its a little intense for faint of heart since its sauce is made from fermented fish paste but it really is an amazing dish. If you're hungry or just adventurous start with Pleah or Bok Lahong. I'm Vietnamese so most of the dishes are very similar to our dishes which I always grieve Yuth, one of the family members who work in the restaurant, about like their lok lak which has their own Cambodian flair to the Vietnamese Bo Luc Lac(See the similarities don't end at the dish itself). The Khmer BBQ is probably the first thing I order every time I visit because it never fails to wow whoever I bring along. Admittedly I love Cambodian katheaw way more than my native pho so another go to is their Mi Keaw or Phnom Penh noodle depending on if I want egg or rice noodles that day. A very small gripe I have is the fish they used to use for the green mango grilled fish used to be different and I loved it way more but it still gets the job done.",

We go after every meeting. Today we did a photo shoot for our foot massage manual and brought our models. We just can't get enough.  The pork is amazing. The skewers are to die for. The Basil Seed drink is like desert. The young coconut is practically fresh off the tree. The Pineapple Soup is so refreshing. There's not a thing on the menu I haven't been absolutely satisfied with.   Bring your own wine. Nice, relaxed atmosphere. It's difficult to spot from the street and parking is in the rear. It's right passed the 99cent store and next to the Napa auto parts and the driveway to turn into has a cute little wagon parked there.   Go. Go now. You won't be sorry.  Oh, closed on Sunday. Don't go on Sunday ;p  *Last note: Sekong is family run with fresh ingredients. Don't come if you're in a rush. Enjoy the atmosphere and bring your own wine or beer. I promise it's worth the wait.",

Try everything and anything. In the short time I lived in AZ, I went here probably about once a month. Their catfish with green mango topping is definitely a must-try. The green mango topping alone is amazing! It's kind of reminiscent of Thai papaya salad but a little less sour and more salty. I would say Cambodian food is between Thai and Vietnamese, not quite as sweet and sour, but is a delicious, tasty and saltier cousin and I dieee for sodium. All day. Anyway, also any of their soups are amazing. Also try the sweet basil drink! For my Filipinos out there who might see this --- really tastes like sago gulaman but I guess healthier cause basil seeds instead of the sago balls. Anyway Reathrey Sekong I miss you so so much! This place is a hole in the wall that deserves your patronage!! You will not be disappointed",

I've ordered about 6 dishes off the menu now, and everything has been perfectly portioned and cooked.  Having never eaten Cambodian before, the closest thing I can compare it to is Vietnamese: it is very light, tastefully seasoned, and is best when the ingredients are fresh.  Everything from the shrimp to the herbs at this place has tasted uber-fresh, and the service hasn't seemed any slower to me than I'd expect at a restaurant.  Maybe some people are confused because the prices are so cheap.  As for atmosphere, the place is really cute.  There's always Cambodian pop music playing (which is often re-worked American songs), and the staff is always very friendly.  Great for lunch or takeout.",

It was also very warm inside the restaurant - they apparently have a/c issues, which they can hopefully fix since it's 112 outside... Each time I was there I saw people walk up and see the \"Cash Only\" sign, only to turn around, which is a shame because this is a good lunch spot!  Service was very friendly and the food came out quickly. The Fish Amok was delicious (after the fact I was told I shouldn't eat Vietnamese talapia due to high levels of mercury...oh well.) The meatloaf sandwich was very tasty - it reminded me of a Bahn Mi sandwich from Lee Lee's - and for only $5, you can't beat that! The iced tea is green jasmine, my favorite and one of the best I've tasted in a long time - very fresh! The Katheaw Cha - a stir fry noodle dish was just okay because the noddles were greasy, but the beef & shrimp were tasty.  I've heard the pineapple soup and crepes are must-trys, so I will probably return once it's cooled off outside. Until then, this is a good place, that with a few tweaks could be great.",

North side of Indian School between 12th St. and 16th St. Used to be Fellini's Pizza. Maybe Mexican food and/or hot dogs as well. Once inside, the place is nicely done. Very comfortable.   Second - The Food - Quite tasty. No insults intended, but it is best described as a less spicy version of Thai food. We all started out with fresh spring rolls. They contained shrimp, pork, rice, carrots, etc... Very well done and very good. One was plenty for me. I had Katheaw Cha. It is fried noodles with beef and broccoli. Again, very tasty. The two companions had crepes (looked more like a folded omelette) and noodle shop. Everything was really good.  I would go back and I would recommend.",

That said, I wanted everyone to know that the menu posted in the photos on Yelp is outdated.  Their prices are considerably higher now.  (Though the spring roll for $3 is still an amazing deal!)  For instance, the Papaya Salad on the menu posted is listed as $5.  But I went there today and their menu has it published at $10.  Double.

She has to come to the USA to experience Khmer food!!  I have eaten Khmer food in San Francisco CA, and in Siem Reap.  Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with Sekong By Night.  It looks like a tiny little forgettable restaurant from outside on the street, but once you step inside. you can see the owner put some thought into the decor.  It really looks Asian.  It is as though the owner went on a shopping trip to Phnum Penh and came back with tons of artwork for the place.    The Amok fish is really nice.  Reminded me of a cafe I had dinner at in Siem Reap some 9 years ago when I was seeing Angkor.  The fish was fresh.  My wife wanted to switch with me (she ordered the Katheaw Cha).    The Katheaw Cha is also very good.    I ordered a Coconut Juice as my drink expecting it to be canned.  It was fresh, and smelled fresh (a pleasant surprise!!!)  My wife ordered the Grass Jelly drink, and it was also good.    I really wish that this place was in Mesa AZ, as I would go more often.  Maybe so, I will make the drive again to this place from Mesa as appropriate.  This place was a pleasant surprise and I wish the owner great success.  I want this restaurant to succeed.    The only place where the Khmer food was better (for me) was Siem Reap, but then it is perhaps a little unfair to compare a restaurant in the USA to what really is available in Cambodia.",

On one of my ventures here I was with a group who decided to try the family style.  We had 2 fish dinners (amok & the mango) both were very, very delicious.  Loved the flavorings.  We also had a couple of the chicken dishes and a cold sliced beef with vegetables. I suggested to the 2nd group since they were not familiar with Cambodian foods to order family style.   Since I know pretty much what I like I wanted to order my own.  I ordered the fish mango again.  Had my standard mango bo bo and ended up taking about half my fish home for a late night snack. Will be returning next week again with another group of eaters.  LOL Never tasted anything here that I didn't like.  I guess that the fish is my favorite. It is a hard choice though. Service is excellent, but just be prepared, especially with groups, that the food is prepared fresh and it may take some time before you get your dish.  They do not bring all dishes at once as that would involve them sitting in the kitchen while they prepare the other dishes. Nobody wants food that has stood and is not hot. What else can I say except that I just LOVE eating here and will keep recommending it to my groups of friends. I just keep coming back!!!!",

This quaint little place tucked on the north side of Indian School is well worth the visit, despite the difficulty you will likely have in finding it.   While culinarily similar to the likes of Thai and Vietnamese food, it is different enough to stand on its own. There are standard spring rolls, but then you can get into the meat dishes and this pancake/crepe thing that is my new favorite. I'm excited for it to cool down just a bit here so I can justify eating more of their soups, of which they have many.   It's run by this young guy who is incredibly nice and is more than willing to give my girlfriend and I some advice on our hopeful and potential travels to the region. I think his mom is the chef, which makes this a great \"mom and pop\" (mom and son, really) place worth the trek from any point in the valley.",

    "text": "I am sticking with my four-star review, but I just read some of the owner's responses to other reviews and the remarks are simply mean-spirited, inappropriate, and unbelievably sarcastic.    Yelp reviews are there for two reasons.    The primary reason for a Yelp review is to alert other would-be customers about restaurants (or businesses) to visit and other restaurants to avoid.  Fortunately for the owner, it is the positive comments about the food that encouraged me to try this restaurant - because if it weren't for Yelp, I can guarantee 100% that I would have never tried this restaurant.  Not everybody is going to like your food, your location, your service, or something else, and that's OK.  Everybody has an opinion, and they are entitled to not only have that opinion, but they are entitled to express it as well.  As an owner, you also have the right to respond, but you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.  The best response is probably no response, and let the good reviews shine through.  Everybody knows that some people are sticklers and there is no pleasing them, so why bother getting into a shouting match?  Honestly, if I had read the responses that were left for other reviewers by the owner before I came here, I would have never stepped foot in the restaurant because the owner's responses were just downright mean and condescending.  I would not have wanted to patronize a restaurant that treats its customers like that before, during, or after a visit.  The second reason for a Yelp review is to provide extremely valuable feedback to business owners.  Consider yourself lucky to live in an era where people feel comfortable using Yelp.  It is literally providing you immediate feedback for which you would have to pay a market research company tens of thousands of dollars to compile for you.  And, Yelp does it for free.  Yelp provides a double-edged sword.  It can propel a little-known business into a huge success, and it can deter would-be customers from ever visiting a business based on the honest feedback of others.  Please do not respond to this critique.  It is meant as constructive criticism, to help you have a successful business.  I love to help local businesses succeed, and that is why I leave a Yelp review in the first place.  The food at your restaurant is wonderful, but if some people don't care for the food, or the service, or the ambience, then you can take the criticisms to heart or you can ignore them.  But, it is in your best interest to focus on the positive, ignore the truly negative, and use constructive suggestions to help your business succeed.  I sincerely wish you continued success, and I have already told several people about the amazing food there.  But, the treatment that other reviewers received really put a sour taste in my mouth.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch yesterday with the boss. I did a very cursory glance over the menu on their home page and was delighted to see that they had pho-style dishes here. Then only spent a second to check the Yelp star rating before heading out from the office. I read the reviews, as well as the owner retorts, after I got back home from the office - and laughed over the \"butt-hurt one\".. *8-) Reminiscent of the infamous Amy's Baking Company review and reply.. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.phoenixnewtimes.com%2Fbella%2F2010%2F08%2Fouch_todays_hard_lesson_on_yel.php&s=f720dfd5c99404e219407a7ede4a39d575fb4bb866b1f132e45ac669bb82d688\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">blogs.phoenixnewtimes.co...</a> for those of you who missed it the first time round..  Anyway, I've never had Cambodian food before, but I'm a big fan of pho and quite partial to Thai food as well. I'm going to agree with the hard-to-findness of the location. The boss let me know where it is, Google Maps AND Waze tried to tell me where it is, and I still had to circle back and triplecheck the map out front of a 99c store before I inched back out onto Indian School and finally dodged into a tiny catty-corner parking lot with a giant Mexican circular water fountain oddly set directly into the tarmac. No other vehicles except the boss' motorbike. Inside, greeted by the waiter (I assume Yutheana) and sat with the boss. Place was completely empty (apart from us) but I liked the decor - including the concave xylophone up front which reminded me a bit of a dinosaur's ribcage. At the table, I ordered a diet cola. It tasted a little odd - not horrible or anything, but sort of.. either the syrup was off or someone had put a tiny bit of honey in it? No matter. I found the description of their Phnomh Penh soup too amusing not to order it - \"Got guts? Wahey - so does this soup!\" Who could resist heart, liver, intestines, ground pork and shrimp in a pho broth? The boss ordered the Amok Fish.  The waiter came over for a bit of a chat and overheard us talking about how the place was hard to find. Apparently they used to have a sign out front.. which went away for some reason. This place needs blinking neon lights and perhaps a sandwich-board holder wearing a pig intestine costume or something, because it's absolutely nondescript when you're driving past and I'm actually very surprised to see so many reviews - must be word of mouth visits because it sure as hell wouldn't be people going \"Hey, check this Cambodian restaurant out that we're driving past..\"  Out came our dishes. High marks for presentation - it all looked quite appetizing, especially the fish dish. Unfortunately, flavour wise, mine was.. just a'ight. I honestly don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't as confrontational a flavour as I guess I thought it might be. In fact it was rather bland. I love spicy food - especially Indian - but usually with pho I drown it in lemon or lime. I put a squirt of lime down on the top and had a few bites. Shrugged at my boss. Surprisingly the lime did nothing for this dish - but a couple of big squeeze bottles of hot sauce had been supplied and I used that instead. THEN the dish came somewhat alive! Interesting.  Would I get the dish I got again? Probably not if I was hungry and/or after something with a little taste to it, but definitely if I wanted to shock friends. The boss didn't mind his but said there were probably four other dishes he'd like to try first before re-ordering the Amok. I didn't hate this place, I certainly didn't think the prices were too high like others observed, but it wasn't stunning enough to warrant more than a \"passable\" rating IMO.  Now if only someone would open up a MALAYSIAN restaurant - the last time I had a decent laksa was over a decade and seven thousand miles ago. Sigh.  Edit 20120414: I came to your restaurant looking for lunch. My review THEN went on to wish for a Malaysian restaurant, riding a completely different train of culinary thought. Imagine star number 3 on my review start to flicker as its batteries begin to run out.  Edit 20121030: Dropped to a single star based on the smart-mouthed and completely unnecessary response from the owner. Will not return.",

My second visit was great. I called ahead to order. The owner told me my food would be ready in 15. When I arrived he was standing up front, holding my food. I paid, and joked with him on how he was so quick to rebuttal the bad yelp reviews. He laughed, and said that he just wanted his customers/potential customers to know both sides of the story. I like that-  My food was excellent. Beef noodle soup is what I usually order from my top pho joints.. Sekong's is on par with them. I do notice slight differences between Sekong's soup, and pho. Sekong's toasted garlic gave their broth a delicious flavor. My spring roll was also delicious. My only complaint would be the sauce choice for the spring rolls. This is just personal preference though. Don't get me wrong, I like the sauce Sekong provided, but I love the hoisen/peanut sauce most Viet places serve up. Not knocking Cambodian tradition or anything :)  Note- Last time I got the soup with all the guts in it.. I wasn't a huge fan. Maybe someday I will acquire a taste for it. The intestines were a little.. ahem.. ripe. Rightfully so, I mean, doo doo has touched those pieces of membrane in your bowl at some point.. pretty regularly too considering how the digestive system works. Usually I am into all the tripe, and tendons..even gelatinous pig blood at my spot in Tempe.. Shit, throw a knee cap in there too. Intestines just aren't for me right now. I am glad I had the guts to try it though",

    "text": "I want to start this off by saying that my wife and I have been to this restaurant twice. We went for the first time a little over a year ago to try something new and swore we would become regulars, well for some reason that didn't happen, and we went again last night.  Anyways, our first visit we had an older lady there helping us get our order (we were getting it to go). She knew about everything on the menu, was not only helpful, but very willing and happy to help. We could not remember exactly what we had ordered, so I won't comment on the specific dishes, except the fact that we loved all of what we had (otherwise, why in the world would we want to become regulars, right?!).....  I lie. I remember one thing that we had, and it was their coffee. Delicious. It comes in a tall glass, with condensed milk at the bottom, and the coffee slowly dripping down on top of the condensed milk. Trust me, get the coffee!  So last night we decide we really wanted to go back here. We had a different server, and younger man. He was just as, if not more so, nice as the first lady that was there. He would explain the differences in the dishes, and when asked what he recommended, he didn't say \"everything\" (pet peeve of mine). I got the Che Kreung (sp?) and my wife got a dumpling soup. We also shared the Baiykung (sp again?) Crepes. They were delicious! Filled with ground pork, shrimp, and bean sprouts. Served with a side of lettuce, mint, cilantro, cucumber, and fish sauce. All eaten together is truly awesome.   My wife had Jasmine Iced Tea, and that was surprisingly really good. It comes unsweetened, and I don't think I would want to add sugar to it either.  My wife loved her dumpling soup. It has dumplings, and rice noodles. The broth alone was really flavorful without adding anything into it. If you like Vietnamese Pho, you can get this, or the Katheya (Cambodian version of Pho). The broth for Katheya is chicken and pork broth as opposed to beef broth. They also add fried garlic to it.  My Che Kreung which is a lemongrass stir fry was delicious. Came with pickled veggies (carrots, cauliflower, and cucumber), white jasmine rice, and beef which had onion and green beans mixed in. The lemongrass is definitely there flavor-wise. Everything was truly delicious, and again my wife and I left saying we will become regulars, but obviously, we are slackers :)  Either way, my wife and I really love this little shin-dig. Great service, clean, decent prices, can't go wrong. We will definitely be back, if not as regulars!",

We ate family style, a few friends and myself, and we ordered egg rolls and spring rolls to start as well as a classic Southeast Asian salad with cabbage, chicken, and a light vinaigrette. We shared the ginger chicken (but they kindly substituted shrimp per our request) and the flavors were amazing. Lemongrass and green onions. The ginger was subtle, but overall the dish very hearty. The student salad was next and was perfection. A sweet, sour, and slightly tangy dressing made it so classically southeast Asian. The lemongrass chicken came next and definitely was one of my favorites. The luk luk beef...? Was not my favorite. I enjoyed the combination of beef with red onions and tomatoes, but sadly it tasted like the beef had soaked in soy too long. A bit salty. Pork dumplings in a soup were good, but also not as great as the other dishes. Very bland and could have used acidity. Lastly we had a pineapple soup and it was divine. Definitely would get that again in a heartbeat! For dessert banana tapioca, warm with coconut milk. Very authentic and I loved the atmosphere. Quaint, not pretentious at all. A humble restaurant with excellent food. Service is on the slower side but it's because the kitchen is very small and they bring food out once it's made. I will definitely be back!!!",

    "text": "Having now got 2 people on my case I thought it would be best to clarify and explain perhaps in more detail.  First off, I didn't mean any offense to Cambodian people as a whole and if they are upset I apologize for my tongue in cheek attitude. I don't know any and from this experience I'm not bothered by that in the slightest.  Secondly, the selling off as Cambodian is an inaccurate statement which I'll happily retract here. It would be unfair to both Vietnamese and other Cambodian restaurants. I was more trying to make the point to those that were wondering what Cambodian food was like, that it is very much akin to Vietnamese food. It's not my fault there are more Vietnamese restaurants in the US and probably based on this I can see why.  Generally I've found that places with a higher yelp rating are harder to get into which makes perfect sense to me. This place was NOT full (about half full when we came in) nor happening despite what the owner says! Funnily enough, he has the cheek to call me a liar?! Insensitive comments - yes. Liar - no. (More on the owner's lying later)  The poor start relates to that and the poor service which the owner disputes (I have no idea why this fact is disputed). If you have to wait over 5 mins. in a restaurant before contact (not physical contact as the owner oddly suggests) then that's a poor sign. I've only been to 500 places so what would I know?!  Then the owner decides that because the food is brought out that makes it excellent service? Are you kidding me?! That was the funniest comment so far. That comment alone is enough to confirm to me that they have no clue to the meaning of the word service. Bringing out dishes is a given! lol Nothing to do with service - I will say the plates were put down on the table nicely if that's what is being alluded to?  The owner could just have asked where I'm coming from and I would have gladly responded with my opinion to which I am fully entitled as is the owner. Should probably think about \"customer is always right\" before launching a senseless tirade/defense of service! Try engaging your customers and explaining things if it is sooooo different?!!!  I'd add that the menu has a good number of items on it and never did I suggest that they should be able to make or sere every single type of Cambodian dish? That was funny too.  But by far the funniest is the comment about the egg roll coming at the end of the meal. Why would say that and then have a picture of the amok fish with an egg roll on yelp?! Yet the owner calls me a liar? Just own up - you forgot, had a bad day whatever. You think lying is going to make your place look better?!  If I were only judging this place against against other restaurants in the Phoenix area then I would have given it 2.5 stars. Not trying to be generous, I tell it how I see it. I'm glad other people had such an amazing experience but unfortunately we did not. The blame for that must primarily lie with the owner. I'd have thought you would want to satisfy your customers, not like to them!  I give it a 1 star because I am comparing this restaurant to the many others I have visited and base if off the entire experience from start to finish. Why wouldn't I compare it? That's how a rating can be generated! You have to know good to know bad, so that to me is the essence of rating a place, by comparing it to others. It's nothing to do with how fancy a place is or not. e.g. a hole in the wall restaurant with good food and service would get 5 stars to me, but a pricey steakhouse with amazing ambiance but ok food and good service would get 4. Lying to the customer gets 1 star.  To finish (finally!) I apologize for the Cambodian references mentioned earlier, I meant no offense and hope to have cleared those up. However the service was appalling and the food lackluster. That was our experience. Nothing can change that now. Let's see if the owner can come clean or will they have to resort to more petty name calling like they are in the fourth grade!",

I love eating it at the places back home so I was excited to try this place.  They may be similar is some senses to other asian cultures but they are uniquely their own too.  Tried the Loat Cha and pork pate sandwich. The loat Cha was a new Cambodian dish for me. Compared to other dishes I've had, I thought the flavor was just ok.  Nothing I'd get again. The noodles were fun shaped but the texture was a bit hard in the middle so not sure if that is normal or it just happened to not be cooked right that day.  The sandwich was good. Took it to lunch the next day so it held up pretty well when you have them separate the veggies. Very similar to a banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich).   Prices are higher than what I'm used to at home but I'm assuming ingredients aren't as easy to come by either nor is there a huge competition.  The place is nicely decorated.  They've got Phnom Penh noodle soup which is one of my favorites back home so it will be something I try next time to see how it compares.",

You don't have to travel far to experience a taste of Cambodia, you can get your very own taste of Cambodia right here in Phoenix, Arizona, at Reathrey Sekong.  Today, was my first dining experience at Reathrey Sekong based on the recommendation of a co-worker and fellow \"yelper\".  From the outside, Reathrey Sekong might be an inconspicuous restaurant, however this little gem serves up  some of the best Cambodian cuisine you'll find anywhere.   I will be the first to admit, I am not an experet on Cambodian cuisin, so I can't speak to authenticity.  However, I do know fresh, deliciously flavored cuisine, and that is exactly what you will get when you go to Reathey Sekong.  The menu is expansive with a variety of  soups, salads, sandwiches, noodles, fried rice, speciality drinks, and desserts.  On today's visit, I ordered the eggrolls, Bai Cha Beef Fried Rice, and Basil Seed drink, which is very refreshing.  Our entrees were fresh, flavorful, and absolutely delicious.  I can't wait to visit Reathey Sekong again.  There are so many more entree's from the menu I would like to sample, such as the noodle soups, sandwiches, boba, but, my taste buds will have to wait for my next visit.  So, if you're craving great food, attentive staff, prompt service, pleasant atmosphere , and reasonable prices, stop by Reathey Sekong.",

Please keep in mind this is not fine dinning. Do not expect great service as the focus is on the food. Do not go \"Hangrey\" as this will only make matters worse. Go to experience Cambodian food. There are not too many Cambodian restaurants in Phoenix, so enjoy without any expectations!  Great dishes #1 Spring Rolls!!!! #2 Student Noodles #3 Ginger Stir fry  If the services was on the mark, I would have given it 4 stars - Enjoy",

It's really hard to find and the parking lot sucks. But maybe they designed it that way--you have to work to find the BEST Cambodian food in the valley. It's worth it!   Service can be slow at times bc they have a very small kitchen. I am telling you the food is worth the wait!   I order the pork chop- 10/10 and the chicken fried rice, also a 10/10!",

    "text": "Reathrey Sekong is one of my absolute favorite gems in the valley. I recently set a goal to try more types of ethnic cuisine, which is what drew me to this little restaurant off of Indian School. I've never had Cambodian food before dining here, so I have nothing to base it off of, but after some research I learned that Cambodian food is a bit of a mix of Thai and Vietnamese with some French influence. I have now been here 5 or so times and it is my goal to eat everything on the menu - each dish is unique, surprising, and absolutely delicious.   I somehow convinced my not-so-culinary-adventurous best friends to come to dinner here with me. We ordered a myriad of things, including egg rolls, spring rolls, the basil seed drink, chicken fried rice, BBQ platter, and Bainyachav crepes. Everything was fantastic and even my picky eater bff's were impressed! So I quickly convinced my boyfriend to come back with me ASAP.   This time we both ordered katheaw cha- rice noodles with beef, shrimp, broccoli, and carrots. Yes- we both got the same thing and both loved it, and both thoroughly enjoyed our leftovers!  The third time I went with my team, and there were about 15 of us. It was a \"one of everything\" type of night, and everyone loved it. It was so fun to try things on the menu that I may not have ordered (now that I'm hooked on the Katheaw Cha and Loat Cha), like the Amok Fish. That being said, here are the dishes from Reathrey Sekong that I daydream about:  - Egg Rolls - Spring rolls - Katheaw Cha and Loat Cha, flavors of which are really similar but they feature different noodles  - Bainyachav Crepes - Beef Skewers  Give it a try - you won't regret it!",

    "text": "Wow.  After our aborted trip to Two Hippies one Sunday (it was closed), we looked around on Yelp for another spot for lunch.  Cambodian food caught my wife's curiosity, so we dodged the roadwork in the quest to make it here.  Decorated with antiques (some look like they were from 1950s Cambodia) this place was very pleasant inside.  Service was friendly and smiling.  The food was--quite unlike anything else I've ever had.  The fried rice had chunks of perfectly seasoned, tender beef that gave it. . .dimension (for the lack of a better word) that I never realized that a fried rice could have.  I know that this sounds kind of strange, or even goofy, but the taste was simply phenomenal.  When I spoke to my wife about her lemongrass soup, I realized that I she was having a similar experience with her food.  A previous reviewer referred to this restaurant as \"one of the True ethnic gems of central Phoenix\", and I can't put it any better.  If you're in the area and are thinking about Thai curry or a bowl of pho, may I suggest this alternative.  It's not the particular ethnicity that makes this place unique as much as its sheer outstanding quality.  It's something different, done deliciously.",

Unless it's Sunday, in which case they're closed, and you should go on Monday.  Reathrey Sekong is the sole Cambodian restaurant in Phoenix, and you'll quickly see why once you've eaten here: It would be really hard to compete with. The ambiance and decor are gorgeous, inviting, and tranquil, the menu's varied and intriguing, and the dishes come out absolutely delicious. Service can seem slow if you're used to being rushed in and out the door elsewhere, but if you're not in a hurry, you'll appreciate the attentive but laid back service that gives you time to unwind, savor each dish you order, and actually enjoy the company of whomever you're with.   My partner and I have been here many times and never been disappointed. Do bring your sense of adventure; this isn't some bland Americanized place. There's lots of fermented funk and heat (though also plenty of dishes without), and there's plenty of offal on offer if you're feeling gutsy.   Reathrey Sekong is great for date night, a family dinner, or even just being too lazy to cook for yourself.  If you're overwhelmed by the menu, start with an order of the Student Noodles: You can't go wrong with them. And don't be afraid to ask your server for suggestions!",

This spot is definitely a hole in the wall. When you're driving on Indian School, make sure you slow down a little bit (within safety limits of course), there's essentially only one entrance into their \"parking lot\" from Indian Hill. Once you walk in the door, you will be teleported to Southeast Asia.  Ambience: one of the cutest, most authentic Asian places I've been to in Arizona. From the decor on the wall to their plates and bowls and utensils. You can tell everything were transported from Asia. When you get your checks, they will be clipped onto these cute clippers. The place is the perfect harmony of East and West, modernism and tradition. I was hooked even before I ate the food.   Service: a little slow. They usually only have 1 server every time I've been there for lunch. The food is made with TLC to each order. So you gotta be patient! It's going to be worth it!  Of course, the food: This is what Cambodian cuisine is to me: it's Vietnamese food, meeting Thai food, fell in love, got married, and gave birth to Cambodian cuisine. If you like Viet or Thai food, you will for sure like Cambodian food!   Fried fish with green mango (5/5): my bf loves his fishes, this is one of my favorite dishes here. The fish is perfect fried. The sauce is sweet yet tangy. The green mango adds the perfect crunch. *drooling* Phom Phey noodles (5/5) their specialty noodles! One of my personal favorite because it's super similar to Vietnamese Hu Tieu. This item is not for the faint of hearts (puns intended) because it contains chalk full of... inner organs HAHAHA. I most definitely recommend though, especially for cold winter days! Spring roll (4/5) a little bit over priced for just one long roll, but it's one of the best spring rolls i've had in AZ. Vegetarian fried rice (4.5/5) my vegetarian friend ordered this and she was super impressed. She says that they replaced the seasoning but the dish is still packed with flavors. I tried a spoonful and it was quite yummy!  Chicken Salad (4/5) this is a safe item for you to order for your skeptical non-Asian friend who's not quite familiar with Asian cuisine. It uses Western ingredient with a hint of Asian dressing.    I wanna come back and try so many more items on their menu because I am sooooo obsessed with Reathrey Sekong. Keep on doing that you're doing! Yay for authentic Asian Cuisine in the land of cacti :)",

The noodles weren't soggy, they still had a nice bite to it. I'd definitely be back to try more of their dishes, it was tough just deciding on one entree today!",

Besides that, the ambiance is really nice. The food is excellent, and very reasonable in price. We ordered jasmine tea, fresh mango juice, two spring rolls, and 2 entrees; chicken wings and seafood platter. Our bill was $42. Lots of food and all delicious. The only thing that I thought was odd was the chicken wings, they were gigantic! Maybe turkey wings? Idk, either way they were good. Would definitely go back again.",

I called ahead to make a reservation a few days before and whomever I spoke with that day and day-of were quite polite (had to amend my count day-of). Have no fear if you feel a need to reserve seating since their dining room is small (maybe 10-15 tables total). It's kind of hidden off of the road and is highly likely you'll miss the entrance to the parking lot (shared with an auto shop).   That evening I was first to arrive and the young guy manning the room let me select wherever I wanted to sit. Since it was fairly quiet, we had our pick of spots. LOVE how cozy it is! The guy immediately started pouring water for my friends and I as we sat. He also ran thru the menu since we were all n00bs to Cambodian, his favorites and fan-faves.   Everyone started with a spring or egg roll. Since it is BYOB, I opted for one of their fresh juices as well- so delish! The rolls were a great start to our meal. All of us ordered our own meal. Wish I could remember the name of my plate, but it had chicken and lemongrass flavors. The four of us shared a biiiig bowl of rice, which was more than enough.   Since none of us had anyone to go after, it was nice to not be rushed thru dinner and take our time with each course and conversation.",

There was only 1 server but he did his best to keep up with the crowd. Really didn't have any complaints about the service b/c it's a small mom & pop restaurant. Prices are very reasonable for what they have.   I'll add that I've traveled to Cambodia and this food is authentic. It was as if I was back in Phnom Penh eating at one of their restaurants off the riverside. If you like different Asian dishes and love to embrace the cultural flavors, then you won't regret trying this place out.",

The place was packed on a Friday night, and we ended up being seated in the other room, the overflow space, which seemed as if we'd been seated in the owners' own dining room (we may well have been).   It took a while for our order to be placed, but we didn't give up because the food was supposed to be that good, and it was worth the wait.   Our waitress was also one of the owners, and not only was she very apologetic about the wait, she also told us about her super small kitchen with only a few burners. That is why we ate our meal one entree at a time with the crepes last.   I tasted five different dishes and all were excellent; my fave, however, had to be the grilled pork and the mango fish a close second, perhaps even tied with the noodle dish (mi cha). I doubt if you can go wrong with any item here! So enjoy!",

I would have never thought to order it, but during our wait for our food, I must have swiped past 40+ pictures of this and so of course I had to try it and I'm so glad I did. It was super yum.  Our food was super yum. I don't even like fried rice and I loved it here!   Egg rolls are a must try!   Also, I love the cozy decor.  The okay:  Super long wait for food. We had just flown in from the east coast and had a VERY long day. There was no wait to be seated but it took a very long time to get our food. They seemed to have 3 people manning the entire place, including the kitchen. It was worth it, but probably wouldn't be my first choice if I was super hungry and needed food ASAP.c",

Don't know what I was thinking since it was almost 90 degrees when I landed.  But noodle soups are always good no matter what.  I got the Basil Seed with Grass Jelly drink ($3).  It was cool, refreshing and just a little sweet.  I need to find a Cambodian restaurant in the San Fernando Valley just to get this drink.    I started off with an egg roll ($1) and then a spring roll ($3), it's nice that I can order one of each.  The egg roll was crispy and full of flavor and meat and the spring roll was refreshing.    Then I got the beef ball, tripe and sliced beef rice noodle soup ($8).  It had the cilantro, bean sprouts and lime add on's.  It reminded me of Vietnamese Pho but without the star anise flavor.  I am definitely a fan, when I go back to Phoenix, I will be going back.",

I love their huge bowls of chicken soup w dumplings and noodles. Their meat skewers and stir fry dishes are extremely flavorful. I highly recommended it. The portions, especially the soup bowls, are large enough that you can take half of it home for later. (And you can't beat the price for the quantity). This is a BYOB place, so there is a cost savings at dinner. Yum!  My only suggestions is the place is a bit dusty (the mother in me wants to pull Pledge and a rag out of my handbag and polish some of their artifacts), and they need a better alert system given there are so few employees to monitor when customers arrive at their doors.",

Awcko taco. The AC felt like it wasn't on and had to ask for the ceiling fan to be turned she didn't, so we turned it on ourselves. The papaya salad was a little \"too authentic\" for me.

I can honestly say you can't go wrong with anything on the menu and that they are truly unique dishes and not comparable to other Asian cuisine of that region, it just has more bold flavors overall. Also I recommend having a pot of tea with your meal, since it really helps keep everything moving and is delicious. I'll be getting the coffee next time as that style of coffee is a personal favorite of mine and a little goes a long way in keeping you energized. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area but be on the lookout for it because we drove past it at first but so so glad we were able to find it.",

Their spring rolls are a slice of heaven and their chicken wings are so large they must come from free flying chickens, and are so succulent and satisfying.  Student noodles taught me a lesson in yummy with ample lovely shrimps and the lemongrass soup was perfect.  Wash it down with a pot of hot jasmine tea or a selection of wine or beer and my spouse and I hope to be back sooner than the next anniversary for sure!",

Very clean and inviting interior full of Cambodian decor, there are even some Cambodian books on each of the tables to look at while you dine.  If you like Thai and Vietnamese food this place is basically a fusion of the two. I tried the Loat Cha noodles and they were excellent, with beef and eggs . Only downside was the small portion, would have expected a bit more for the price. For desert I tried the corn. Although to most people corn would be part of the main course this treat was essentially a roasted corn on the cob smothered in a sugary, and fish sauce type glaze. It was excellent and a great alternative to a typical desert item.  Place was a bit hard to find the restaurant name was on the side of a building and not facing the street, and the entrance to park is off to the side of a mechanic shop which is not very apparent.",

    "text": "As a lover of Thai, Indian and good Mexican food - with all the spice and aroma - a friend (who is also a great Italian cook) suggested we try her new \"favorite\" spot. In Central Phoenix and housed in a former Mexican restaurant, the food served at this little place is about as good as it gets. A family-run place (if it's busy, you'll need to be a bit patient), with tons of parking in the back and not much of a sign out front, that's easy to love after your first meal.   Not as spicy as Thai, with fresh veggies similar to Vietnamese food, and the richness of Indian, the Cambodian specialties are wonderfully prepared and extremely fresh. Even if you've never had Cambodian cuisine, there is a lot of familiar ingredients and the servers will be happy to help you. This is one of those places where everyone is quite proud of the food they serve and they understand their menu very well.  Try the spring rolls. Both types (fried and fresh) are perfectly made. The main dishes range from rich curries with rice, noodle dishes with chicken, beef or shrimp, and a number of salads. I find the flavors balanced. Not overdone, with the right amount of sour, sweet, salt and a tiny bit of heat. Where I find that some Thai can be heavy on the fish sauce for most American palates, this place seems to serve more delicate flavors.  If you're looking for a little hole-in-the-wall, unusual place, especially for lunch, I suggest giving Reathrey Sekong a try. I actually didn't even know the name until I looked it up here. We always just refer to it as the Cambodian Restaurant - not like there are a ton of them in Phoenix. I'm happy say that we have become regulars and try to visit every few weeks.",

It was bomb and surprisingly refreshing with the bean sprouts! Don't forget to order a glass of cold soy bean milk - not to be confused with soy milk that you can get at American supermarkets!

I love my mom's traditional Cambodian food and since I left my parents home to make a life of my own, I can never come close to making those foods to taste or look like my mother's foods.  I never stumbled upon a Cambodian restaurant til we moved to Pheonix and a friend told me about this place. My husband grew up with traditional Iowan foods loves this restaurant just as much as I do.  Hubby says its tastes fresh, flavorful, and healthy. The service does take a bit long most times but for us, it's worth the wait.  Pricing is good for the quality of taste.  Presentation is excellent in our eyes, but it is a small family own restaurant.  Everytime I am hungry for traditional Cambodian food, this is where I make my husband take the kids and I to.",

Best food I've had in a long time and very reasonable prices.  Everything was amazing except the roast beef dish.  It came with some dipping sauce that smelled really bad (but they warn you on the menu).  But the other dishes were so good it more than made up for the slow service.

Both were delicious and fresh, and we were especially impressed with the tenderness and the flavor of the beef. While Cambodian food is definitely a unique and distinct kind of cuisine, if you like Thai and Vietnamese food, chances are you won't regret giving this place a try.  In contrast to the plain, nondescript exterior of the building, the restaurant's interior features a distinct look, featuring fairly dim lighting, some paper lamps, and other Cambodian-themed decor. We found it very comfortable, and had no problems with the A/C whatsoever.  I'm surprised to read all of the negative reviews about service here. Maybe we were lucky because it was a Monday, but our service was prompt and responsive. Our waitress was on top of refilling our water and iced tea, and patient with us as we split our check up and each charged our portion separately. I'm impressed with the variety of options on the menu, and will definitely be back here to try more food.",

First off it should be known that this place is BYOB so that means you can bring your own beer or wine and maybe other booze stuffs but not sure. We didn't bring our own boozes so we had Coke and Jasmine tea. I had the Coke, bad idea. It's just regular old real sugar Coke, so you know what that's like. It's great if you're at a food truck, but this place has awesome teas and other asian style drinks that are sure to be much better than dang ol' Mexican Coke. I tried my wife's jasmine tea and it was seriously some of the best tea stuffs ever and I drink a lot of tea.   For food we split the Mi Keaw Noodle Soup, which is the pork dumplings and shrimp one. It was so dang good. You get some plum sauce and chili sauce to season it to taste. They also provide some veggies, etc to add to it. Think pho style stuff.  For our entree we split the Lakhana's Lok Lak Beef I think. It was these delish beef medallions served with a tangy/spicy/gingery sauce and fresh raw veggies. It was super good. My only disappointment is that I wanted to try everything else.   Anyways, you can bet we'll be back anytime we're in the area for a show.",

They have a small or large option and since we were sharing we went large. However, every time something came out we asked, This is the large?   Only been once, so I'll give it another go.

My friends all love their boba drinks and basil seed drink. The only item I would avoid is their iced tea - it tastes like a floral perfume.

I reviewed 3 stars for this restaurant and I get a whole novel, back-sass reply.    \"eventually you found us!  Your mom should be proud.\"  What does my mom have to do with anything? What are you trying to imply? Your restaurant was extremely difficult to find. Maybe you should get a BIGGER sign up because as you can read, MANY yelpers have gotten lost/ or stated that couldn't find this place.  The soup did lack quite a bit of flavor. It was BLAND. It was actually a bland version of a wannabe Vietnamese soup my MOM could make at home. The soup came out way before the dish. Sorry your butt-hurt because I don't like your bland wannabe Vietnamese soup. I said it, what are you gonna do about it?   Few meats on a stick, a bowl of rice, vegetables, and a bland soup for 8 bucks is expensive. I really DID feel jipped. I didn't expect Cambodian food to be this \"pricey,\" especially being in Central Phoenix. My bad, I AM comparing your prices to other asian restaurant in the area. Then again it was my first time actually at a cambodian restaurant and I wasn't satisfied. Again, don't be butt-hurt.   About your sandwich, I can in fact get it somewhere else for cheaper. There are loads of Vietnamese restaurants in Central Phoenix that don't make their bread and also sell it for 2.00 plus tax. I don't know why you are still calling your sandwiches \"Cambodian sandwiches,\" It may be called differently since it was sold at a Cambodian Restaurant but it's the exact same thing as a Banh Mi sold at a Vietnamese restaurant (my bad because I didn't call it whatever you named it on your menu) but except yours is over-sauced and very stingy on the meat.   Why would I have to complain about my sandwich to you when I was there? Shouldn't the staff know how to prepare the sandwich? Am I a criminal for stating my opinion and experience on yelp? YOU make me feel like I am a criminal for yelping three stars which means \"A-okay\". What did you want? five stars? The food wasn't \"As good as it gets.\" If you would reply saying \"sorry for being cheap and stingy on the meats.\" Then maybe I would want to actually return.   ATTENTION YELPERS: Do not yelp lower than 4 stars or the Sekong By Night Nazi will come and get you. Again, this is sarcasm. Don't get butt-hurt. Get a life that isn't so focused on the bad reviews you get on yelp. You have so many good reviews, be happy about it. Your reply ticked me off so I had to reply even if it's been months later.",

When he asked about the Lemongrass Soup, the waiter warned us that it was very \"unique\" but it ended up being EXACTLY what my boyfriend was looking for.   The second time we went in, my boyfriend again got the Lemongrass Soup (which has beef in it) and I asked if it was possible to make a vegetable/tofu or fish version because I don't eat meat but loved the flavor of the broth so much. They said they could make either one for me and I decided on the vegetable and tofu version. It was SO DELICIOUS! So fresh, so flavorful, mmmm! I was really appreciative that they were able to make that for me!  The waiter is always very polite and attentive which is great.  The only difference between our first and second visit was that within a week of our first visit, the prices were raised. The first time we went, we were quite pleased with the prices. I think my Vegetable Soup was $5.50 or $6, and my boyfriend's Lemongrass Soup was $10. Our second visit, the Vegetable Soup was $7 and the Lemongrass Soup was $12. Since we both got the Lemongrass Soup, it was much more pricey than the time before. It just means that we won't be able to come as often as we'd like! I totally understand a business needing to raise their prices based on the economy and being able to maintain their business. Once I am again employed and have the money to support a business with great food like this more often, I will!! Otherwise, when my boyfriend gets his cravings again, maybe he will take me here! ;)",

    "text": "We were looking for a Vietnamese food lunch while in Phoenix for the afternoon. This place popped up on a yelp search, and we figured, why not? We've never had Cambodian food before. The place seems a bit divey on the outside. The decor on the outside, well, it looks like they just took over an old Italian or Greek restaurant.  The inside was delightfully quaint. Lots of old Cambodian relics for the decor, cheesy Asian attempted rock and roll on the speaker system.  I had the lemongrass chicken, my wife had the green mango fish.  Both were absolutely delightful. The spices were kind of like Vietnamese, but earthier,heavier, I guess.  The waiter was friendly and attentive.    I am holding back one star because I would like to see a lunch menu with lunch prices.  (A bit cheaper during the daytime would be nice)  We will definitely be back next time we are in town.",

    "text": "What a great little spot! Off the beaten path and \"off the hook\" as well!   I had seen some previous reviews on Yelp but hadn't thought to check the place out. My parents were in town today and saw a full-page feature in the New Times on this place, so my dad suggested trying it. By the time we arrived after our delightful yoga class at Urban Yoga (how very Central Phoenix - I know, I know), it was about 1:40 and the place was completely empty. Sometimes, that can result in a less-than-enthusiastic greeting from owners or waitstaff but the man who greeted us was friendly and seemed genuinely happy that we were there. I love that.   He took our drink order right away. The sodas were a little under-carbonated but no big deal. Easily fixed, for sure. My mom raved about her iced tea, so no complaints there.   The menu was a little smaller than I expected (the owner later explained that he wanted to start more minimal and then branch out after getting a customer base, which is a good strategy IMO), but several things stood out to me. My dad and I ordered loat chat, worm-shaped rice noodles, but substituted tofu for beef (not immediately obvious that we could do this but we were gracefully accommodated), and the stir-fried shrimp (came with white rice, pickled vegetables and an egg roll). My mom chose the chicken noodle soup and we also got some fresh spring rolls for the table.   All of the food came out very quickly and was extremely flavorful and robust without being too greasy or salty. The shell-on shrimp were a particular favorite of mine - although they were very messy to eat, they were very tender and had a nice kick to them. The rice noodles were also great and the shredded egg on top was a delicious touch.   All in all, our meal was great - and affordable, to boot. All of our drinks, entrees and the spring rolls came out to only $34 including tax and tip. The owner was also great and we all loved his passionate approach to his business. He even told us that he opened the place because he was told that a Cambodian restaurant wouldn't survive in this city.    A rebel after my own heart. And, after all, doesn't Phoenix need more rebels?",

    "text": "Before I get to the reason for the 1 star review let me give you a little bit of background.  I \"Yelped\" banh mi sandwiches for Phoenix last night because I was craving one and wanted to find out what Yelpers out there think are the best.  I was a bit surprised to see Reathrey on the list as they are not a Vietnamese restaurant, but having patronized the restaurant at least a half dozen times, I decided to read through the reviews.    My boyfriend and I originally went to the restaurant after reading the glowing article in Phoenix Magazine.  Our first visit there was pretty uneventful.  We ordered the Mi Keaw soup, spring rolls and the crepe (which by the way was served slightly burned with that side facing down- but I never complain about my food and ordered it again on later visits).  My only real complaint that first evening was the incredibly uncomfortable bench seating.  On subsequent visits we opted for the tables in the center of the space.  I have tried a number of different things on the menu and while having no other Cambodian food to compare it to I find it to be just meahhh.  My boyfriend on the other hand loves the Mi Keaw soup and has ordered it as take out a number of times and is the reason for our repeat business.  In my opinion the Pho at many valley Vietnamese restaurants is much tastier.  Okay - back to the reason for the one star review.  So here I was reading through the reviews when I started coming across the owner's incredibly RUDE, SARCASTIC, CONDESCENDING, DISRESPECTFUL and downright UNACCEPTABLE responses to his less than stellar reviews.  I have three words for you GET OVER YOURSELF!!! I don't care if you are running a Michelan star rated restaurant (which CLEARLY you are not) that type of disgusting behavior will run your business into the ground.  I, for one, will be spreading the word and NOT in a good way.    Sincerely, A very disappointed EX-patron",

I went there and was quoted 20-30 mins, which was understandable, if not a little inconvenient since I could have avoided the long wait if they had just answered their phone to begin with. It ends up taking a little more than 40 minutes, which is again a little annoying, but whatever, it happens. I get home and realized they have forgotten my egg rolls, but by that time they are already closed so there is not much I can do about it. But dang it, I was really looking forward to those egg rolls! The rest of the food that I ordered was pretty yummy, but they really need to improve the service side of the business. I may or may not be back.",

    "text": "This place is a total disaster.  I liked the food here, and that is usually the only thing I base my rating on.  I'm fine with a dive that makes no attempts at great service.  My experience here was just so terrible that I can't give them more than 2 stars.  First, on a 116 degree day, the temp in the dining room was about 90 degrees and very humid (even though it was dry outside).  I'm not sure if their AC was broken or they were using swamp coolers.  Everyone there was sweating, patrons and staff.  It wasn't so bad when we walked in, but after 40+ minutes I couldn't wait to just get outside.  They also had broken credit card machines.  So, they brought out an iPhone to process my card.  The server stood over me and said I was supposed to select 15, 20 or 25% tip and sign.  It was very awkward.  I always tip 20%+, but that alone made me want to tip less.  I asked for a receipt because it seemed a little weird and they said their printer was broken, but that they could email me a receipt.  I gave my email and never received a receipt.  As for ordering.  I love banh mi, so I was excited to try the Cambodian sandwiches.  My dining partner and I ordered the pork sandwich, a lemongrass chicken, spring roll, basil seed drink and an iced coffee.  After taking our order, they came back 10 minutes later to say they were out of the bread for sandwiches.  This was odd because it was early at lunch time and this is one of the main categories of options on their menu.  I guess they just forgot to order some that day, it's not like they ran out.  We ordered the crepes instead.    The lemongrass chicken was awesome.  The melon soup it came with was very light and good, but almost impossible to eat because it was so hot in there.  The pickles on the side were the best part.  So good.  The crepe was ok.  It was like a vietnamese banh cuon, but not as good.    The coffee was good, but we didn't get it until after the meal was entirely finished.  We weren't eating fast or anything and we ordered it before the food.  So, I'm not sure what the issue was there.    I would recommend getting take out.  This place is a total disaster, but they have great lemongrass chicken!",

Probably because there was a lot of Thai food and influence on the menu. The staff is friendly and I like the experience they give. I think this place is rated so high b/c it is a novel thing in Phoenix (or anywhere for that matter) to eat Cambodian food or to say you've tried it. But really, it's not worth going there just to say it, b/c it really does not taste like most of the food I had in 7 days of eating in Cambodia, and there are better thai/asian places in the Valley.",

I was the only one there for lunch, and my server was attentive at just the right moments, but not obtrusive at all.   For $9, I got an enormous bowl of chicken soup (the Cambodian version of Pho, for reference), a gigantic spring roll, and a glass of grass jelly juice, which I can only describe as a boba-like drink.   I am so glad I found this little place, because it will be such a nice change of pace to get my southeast Asian food fix in a friendly, clean, cute restaurant instead of braving the health code disasters on 19th Ave.   Please seek this place out and give it your business so we can keep it alive!",

I also got the meat combination plate. It came out beautifully decorated. Each of the meats had a nice sweet caramelization without compromising the flavor of the meat. The blackened chicken was my favorite. It had so much juicy flavor that I couldn't help but to get down on it with my hands.

The stir fry was so flavorful and delicious, I thought I was making a scene as I scarfed it down. I love spicy, so I opted for the chili sauce with it,  but I ended up not even using it because it covered up the crazy flavor of the stir fry. It was like nothing I've ever had!
