I love that they make the food fresh every day and have whatever is left in a case so you can see what people liked and was popular or maybe wasn't as popular, but you get the sense that everything is good because there's hardly anything left!  Good sign that all the food is good.  So I tried the full plate with a lentil and spinach wrap and the kale salad. I'm mostly skeptical about kale salads because they are often very acidic in order to take away the sharp green bitter taste of the kale. I actually like the green taste of kale, so I really appreciated that this salad wasn't acidic. It was hearty and savory.  The wrap was so tasty. I loved the lentil mixture wrapped in spinach and cabbage and then held together with a wheat tortilla. So good, healthy, satisfying.  I would love to try this place again and see what else they serve.  It felt very community oriented but you have to sit outside if you want to \"dine in.\" I guess it could be cool to take the food to go since you really don't have to wait to get your food.   Can't wait to go back.",

The owner really knows what she is doing! She's wicked smart with the veggies - especially cooking kale and using great spice combinations.    I always get the dolmas with tahini, and if they have it, the kale salad (there are several variations) it never disappoints. The best option is to get the lunch plate with 3 items. It's almost too much food for me, but I can never just stop at 2 items. You are allowed to taste a few items if you can't make up your mind, my favorite special item was the apple slaw - so fresh and tasty.     On top of all of this tasty food, I can't imagine a place that has better customer service. The first time we went in my fiance wanted some fruit with granola and even though it wasn't on the set menu for the day, the owner made something up special for us and it was the tastiest fruit medley I've ever had - ripe, glorious fruit with freshly made granola. YUM.    I honestly have no criticisms... this place is great. My ASU co-workers all agree this is the best spot for a lunch date. I hope it doesn't ever change (unless they open dinner service, which would make my life totally complete).",

Fortunately, one of my friends knew exactly where he was going.  This place is a tiny store with no indoor seating. You go in, there's a menu and a glass case full of their (changed daily!) food selection, and you order and pay right there. Water is in a dispenser in the front, and they have glasses for you to serve yourself. At the end of your meal, you just quickly bus your own plates.  In terms of service, the ladies working here are great! They're friendly, helpful, conversational, and very generous with the samples. Any questions, feel free to ask them and be enlightened!  For food, most of my friends got wraps (custom and the wrap of the day), whereas I had just eaten, so I settled for a small hummus plate with pita bread. Despite being a small, I still got what I thought was a big serving for a very good price (around $5). Extremely good, and I liked their selection of hummus!  In general, if you're in the Tempe area and are craving some healthy vegan food, make the effort to find Desert Roots. I definitely want to make a return trip already.",

    "text": "I hate to be the party pooper but as someone who is a healthy cooking fanatic and always on the search for a lighter choice when I'm on the go, this place doesn't put me off the charts on my wow-meter. The portions are plentiful which is very nice considering the price. The ingredients do seem fresh as well and I very much like seeing the open kitchen. The staff has always been friendly, but when it comes to taste, texture and \"health\" I think there is room for improvement.  Most of the salads I have tried, whether potato, pasta or legume based, have been grossly overdressed. The adjective that comes to mind is \"gloppy.\" The chana masala chickpeas had a pool of oil sitting in the middle and the batch was overly salted. The thai peanut vegetables were overly coated with a viscous dressing, though the flavor was decent. Each time I see a beautiful creation and order it, my lips feel coated chapstick after a few bites. The wraps have good flavor, but I don't see the point of stuffing them with rice. Carbs and carbs don't feel healthy to me when coated in a coconut sauce. To be fair, the chili I had last week was fantastic. Earlier this week however, when it was 60-some degrees outside, they had no soup. Seems like an odd special to be missing when the season finally turns.  I think there is terrific potential and I hope Desert Roots fares well. Local food that is fresh made, open and honest, is what I live to support. There is absolutely no doubt that this humble cafe provides better choices than most of the options on Mill. But I can't sing praises quite yet. A few tweaks to thin out the sauce, adjust the seasonings and maybe some better carb/protein combos and I'll be a regular.",

Try to get here earlier than the lunch rush because they can sell out very quickly. The staff is very nice here, better than any other staff I've encountered and they are very accommodating and friendly if you have any questions. Some of their dishes can be quite oily, but the food is fresh and be sure to try before you buy. I have to say that it is quite expensive here too, so that is something to keep in mind.",

The food was great and you can taste the freshness in every bite. When I'm not bringing my homemade vegan lunch to work, you'll find me here!",

    "text": "I have come in 3 times now. I think I know what I am talking about....and what I am talking about is the most healthy, organic, and delicious veggie dishes I have tasted. Rather than masking their foods with mock this and Seitan that, this place dishes out ridiculously tasty treats. Come veg out with me  ~Fud/Drink~ The food here folks...so good. They hand prepare everything in store either the day before or the day of. I mean, literally the kitchen is open you can see them preparing the dishes in front of you. Because of the sheer size of the dishes they are doling out (usually at least 6+ handmade dishes) they are prepping all day long. Luckily I have tried both their breakfast and lunch (lunch twice). For breakfast I got a tofu scramble with potatoes...SO GOOD! I had some vegan dressing (from Whole Foods) that I dipped it in once back in the office, and it was heaven in my mouth. There were no byproducts, just straight up organic firepower.  For lunch please see my pics :-) I have gotten a couple wraps along with legume-filled sides. I absolutely adored the Baba Ganouche Salad as well, btw. The best side to date is the Quinoa & Israel Couscous....it is wickedly good. No complaints with my tummy either, which happily enjoyed the deposits of fresh veggies.  I want to point out I am not a vegetarian. I am more Pescatarian than anything else, but I eat a ton of veggies. I think I do veggies really well....but Desert Roots knocks it outta the park consistently. They do have random drinks to choose from, more natural and such...I just opt for water with it being so hot out. No liquor here, btw.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ Top notch service here. They welcome me each time like family and are more than willing for me to try. I see how hard they are working and always give a bit of a tip because it is such a small operation (maybe 5 people working here about?). I have come during off hours, so the atmosphere is pretty quiet, but they have a great back patio and I can guarantee this is an easy escape from the craziness on Mill. Keep that in mind, this is nothing like anything else on Mill, very quiet and relaxing space for the person who is more to themselves.   ~The Downlow/Extra~ Come here and eat some very healthy food...while not overtly realizing it :-D The staff here does an outstanding job and the quality...OH THE QUALITY.... top of the line. 5 stars goes for creativity in dishes, consistency in quality, top notch service, a quiet escape on Mill (who would've thunk it), and for proudly being vegan friendly through and through. Jefe star of approval goes out to Desert Roots!",

They have a range of foods to choose from; multiple flavors of hummus, tasty veg creations, quinoas, and for those with a sweet tooth, pies and cookies as well. The menu is ever changing and all made from scratch. Inside you'll see an open, clean kitchen full of fresh veggies and did I mention, CLEAN. This place got the 5th star for customer service. The staff is all welcoming and helpful. Aren't sure what to order? Don't worry, they offer samples of whatever you'd like to ensure a happy order. Im very much so looking forward to my next dining experience here.  *note: only outdoor seating is offered*",

It's not like some places where fake meat and a lot of sauces are used so I feel it should be healthier.  The tastes is very natural which I like but it might seem blend to some people.  The menu is ever changing so it's fun to just try it out every time you go and they actually allow you to try the samples!!!!  The price for the full plate/wrap+1item/half wrap +2items are $10 which is not cheap but it's not too bad. I was getting full even before I finished half of that wrap so it's worthy of the money. For me it wouldn't be my regular every day lunch option due to its price but if I want a good dinning out lunch this would be the place.",

One big negative, and I HOPE it's just because I just came at a wrong time, is that it took a real long time to get food.  Only two people were in front of me, but the whole operations came to a halt, and I waited about fifteen minutes before even ordering.    The lady prepping the food was a machine though, and smiling the entire time.  I have a feeling you'll never eat the same thing twice here as the menu changes rapidly, and she's serious when she says, \"I'll put whatever you want together.\"  I had a curry wrap with a pesto rigatoni (it had fancier names, but this is what it was) and it was delicious!  I had some crazy type of sugar cookie iced tea that I'd like to have a gallon of.  I sat outside underneath some nice trees and cute floral arrangements.  ZEN.    So, probably a solid five stars if it turns out that the wait was an accident.",

It is made fresh each day, and all day long. The other thing that was great is there was a big line when I arrived, and I thought that it being a small business, that it would take forever.

Found 'Desert Roots Kitchen' on yelp and was enticing by the name and the cuisine. Yay! It was Vegan. Was slightly hard to locate the restaurant but kind of liked the rustic location :). The display said open for Breakfast and Lunch. I saw someone inside(probably the owner) and got excited but she  said they had closed the kitchen in the afternoon. Was disappointed to hear. The sweetest thing was she offered me a display spinach and lentil wrap for me for FREE and asked us to try since we came looking for the restaurant. I was totally amazed!! She even told I would have offered you a soup to try. In every bite I could feel the freshness of the greens and lentils. The wrap looked simple but loaded with lot of proteins. I wish they had a branch in the Bay area, I'm glad to have tried something and the owner was really sweet to have offered the wrap. In my next visit to Phoenix I will surely go back and try other dishes. Recommend this restaurant to everyone who visits Tempe.",

I can't even properly describe what I had but here it goes.  One was a wheat pasta with red onion and jalapenos I think maybe a little balsamic in it, a lentil dish, and a rice pilaf with coconut and little pineapple and again I think jalapenos.  I mostly just pointed and said \"I'll take that\".    I half expected to not like at least one of the dishes but they were all stellar!!  So much flavor and spiced perfectly.    This place is small like your closet small and seating is outside which could be a little rough in the summer but there is shade.    Best part, the people here smile and are so friendly and you can tell there is a lot of LOVE put into this food. Oh they give samples too..",

The food and drink menus change daily at the discretion of the cook. I can't wait to come back and sample more creations.  My BF and I, both got the half wrap with two sides because we wanted to try as many different foods as possible. The dolma are to die for! The portions are large but you can stuff your face and not feel sluggish. Usually I am totally guilty of adding way too much sweetener to my teas, but the iced teas were so good that adding anything would have been completely unnecessary (FYI: Free refills!). Same with siracha, I tend to drown my food with it, but not here. The foods and drinks are just so fresh, balanced and good that it's completely unnecessary to add any condiments.    The staff is amazing, you could tell they took pride in their creations. When I asked the server what his favorite side was, he compared it to having to chose which one of his children he loved the most. The outside seating was like an oasis, surrounded by bougainvillea vines and the sounds of running water.   My single complaint are the opening times: Mon - Fri 10 am - 4 pm. Please consider being open on a Saturday!",

As one of my sides, I got a salad and I felt that it was really not worth getting the salad because you get way less food than if I had gotten two more heavier sides. Perhaps they should have done this by weight - otherwise I'm just going to order the three heaviest sides in order to feel like I'm getting the best value for my money.

Local in-season & healthy food.  The kitchen is open right there in front of you.  The owner/head chef is the cutest little happy woman ever!  The fellow that explains the sides/entree of the day - very gracious.  They have a constantly changing menu where you can do a half main dish (wrap is my experience) and 2 sides - it's been hard to finish my plate really - good portions in my opinion.  The sides are prepped on display - so your only wait is the main entree for lunch.  They let you sample the sides so you can pick the ones you want - I really appreciate that!  A very rare opportunity - the flowers used to decorate your meal - they are edible!  Yes they taste like flowers lol.    Only downside is seating is outdoors under a canopy (no misters) - if it's a hot day just prepare to order take out.    FYI it's off Mill Avenue in a courtyard - walk in and veer right - you just don't expect it to be there .  You clear your own plate when finished.  They have a key for the nearby bathroom inside.  They have books you can thumb through while you eat as well - nice touch.  I'm overall extremely pleased with the staff and the quality/flavor of the food!  If you're near mill - stop in!  Heck, just make the trip - lots to see/checkout afterwards too.",

Everything I have tried has been really good and satisfying.  The salads and hummus are always fresh and server up deli style from the case. So it's really quick to stop in eat on the patio and head back about your day.  The staff is exceptionally nice and helpful giving you suggestions of things to try and what they have for the day.  It's a little hard to find at first since it's in a back nook off the street, but well worth it once you know here it is.  If you are curious about vegan food or just want something not fried for lunch this is pretty much the best place on Mill.",

They offer samples of the sides. My bad. I like the changing menu and the outside seating. No inside seating available. Friendly staff and clean. I can't say anything bad about food other than it just isn't as tasty as the unhealthy stuff. Glad to have this option and I hope they stick around. Now I just need to go find a cookie shop cause my taste buds are addicted to the yummy stuff.",

The 2 sides we picked was some asian inspired noodles...not really something I would pick again, but I just didn't like the spices.  And a massaged kale salad that blew my socks off!

I dig the hippy vibes, but it is a food place so having hygiene as a priority should be something to consider. All of the male servers I've seen have facial hair, and it's just disgusting that it ends up on people's food. Just an FYI. If you don't mind a couple of facial hairs on your food, then have at it. Such a shame because their food is delicious, but I won't be coming back.",

Do you mind when your server who serves you meats or alcohol offensive if they smoke? Cigarettes, although not the healthiest thing on the planet, are not made from dead animals, or GMOs. Eating a vegan diet, for some, has more to do with a cruelty-free way of living, rather than a health choice.\" - Sally M.  Dear Sally M.,  The issue is not that I am judging you for smoking.  I assure you I do not care one lick of an iota if you smoke.  It's that you smoked right outside your restaurant, then waltzed back in and immediately went to serve up some hummus.  My issue is that this is unsanitary, and whether you're serving a veggie wrap or a ribeye smothered in extra GMO meat sauce, just plain gross.    Rebecca",

I'm not a vegetarian, but wanted a break from the crappy options nearby, so I decided to give it a shot.  I'm not very familiar with vegetarian dishes, so it took me a while to figure out what I wanted. She noticed that I was staring blindly at the menu and offered me samples of all 6 dishes she had prepared and made me try them.   I walked away with a platter of 3.",

When I walked in, I was directed to a cold case that had a bunch of side dishes. I guess you can shove these side dishes into wraps or bread if you like. Not many gluten-free options, so I was encouraged to try the potato salad. For $5, I got a small tub of the most average potato salad I've had all year. I really wish Mill Ave had a better vegan option, like a Green or Pomegranate.",

I walked in to order today with my lovely girlfriend and had the most pleasant dinning experience. I was welcomed by friendly staff and healthy options. I opted for the wrap for $8.50. Definitely a good choice. I did so because I saw a ready burrito there and it looked scrumptious.  I was given some very distressing information.  \"Im sorry but we are out of Mexican rice\", said the man at the counter. My heart sank. This was it. Its all over. We should of settled for the place downtown! But wait, a light shines. \"Why don't you just tell me what you want in it and ill make it for you in the wrap?\" There is a God after all! and he is hiding in my completed wrap of purple pepper, basil, Orzo mixed with coconut lentil soup and fresh green vegetables. This went so well with the alternating bites of my girlfriends delicious soy parfait (3.50) with homemade granola sweetened with honey and fresh fruit.

The menu changes everyday which provides nice variety, although I have had favorites that I wish I could have on a regular basis. I've never had a wrap that I didn't enjoy. It's a hidden gem and is only open during typical business hours which is sad if I'm having a desert roots craving over the weekend or evening. There is hardly any seating area, and it's all outside so be prepared to eat standing up or at another location.",

I came here with a vegetarian friend who loves the place. I tried a couple different things ive never had before. Some I liked and some I didn't but that's just taste preference I could tell that everything was fresh and was packed with flavor. The one thing I was was that it was more customisable. For someone like me trying something new , alot of it was stuff that was pre made or could not substitute out say onions or mushrooms. So I was more likely to not like something then if I could take it out. But for someone who is more onto veggies I'm sure that's not an issue",

Every time I eat here I feel ultra healthy, like I'm in that Seth Rogen meme. The prices are cheap and the portions are hearty.   The menu changes daily and they are pretty good with keeping their Facebook page updated with the menu, but sometimes they forget. I suggest calling ahead with any questions and/or to get the daily menu.  They do have desserts sometimes, but I have not yet had the pleasure of trying them.  The employees are friendly and helpful. It's a small cafe, but the patio seating is prime for warmer months. I suggest carry out during winter, unless cold is your thing. It's tucked in the plaza off Mill and 4th. If you've been to the Escape Room, it's right next door to that.",

    "text": "I was back and forth today on what I wanted to eat. In doing a \"healthy lunch\" search on here, I came across this place which I had bookmarked some time ago.  I called ahead of time after looking for a menu online. The lady who answered was very bubbly and willing to let me know, everyday is special here. By that she meant there aren't specials persay but a daily wrap item with a number of side choices available. She read me the whole list of things they had and I couldn't help but to check it out.  It has been awhile since I have visited Mill Ave. I was aware there have been many changes to what is available there but I must have missed the \"No Free Parking\" for anyone, no matter what. I am beginning to realize it is unfair to drop stars for the business due to a decision made by the city. Okay, so I pay my $2 for what I know will take less than 20 minutes. Parking lot off of 3rd st & Ash.  The location is hidden a bit in the court area, it does provide signage if you're paying attention and quite honestly, had I had the time I would have sat on their quaint little patio to enjoy my food. The gent was very friendly, explained the whole run down and chatted as he prepped my wrap for me.   Double dill chickpea wrap with a side of tomato lentil curry. It was difficult to decide on my side... the Southwest Tapatio Pintos sounded really good as did the Pineapple Jalapeno Rice Pilaf. However, if you've read any other reviews, I LOVE curry! With that said, there is not enough curry in the world to satisfy my curry needs. And so, tomato curry lentils... add some broccoli, shredded carrot, green onion, lentils, tomato and not enough curry (for me). The curry is there don't get me wrong, but I would douse it all over, in and on top.   The double dill chickpea wrap, I wasn't sure what that even meant. Whole chickpeas, likely for some substance and a rice hummus like filling? Zucchini, maybe a dash of cayenne, identifiable dill (thank goodness) and crispy crunchy romaine. Gone, in seconds! I feel like I had a pretty healthy bite to eat today. Oddly enough, it's the one time I may say there wasn't enough salt. That isn't to say the flavor was lacking because it wasn't by any means. It just means they likely use an appropriate amount of salt and let the flavors do the talking. Easier to put it in than it is to take it out, I always say so the salt part is really neither here nor there.   Some of the sides are the same as yesterday, which he said everything is made fresh, probably not necessarily daily, depending on their business from the previous day. I am totally good with a next day side although I did notice on their instagram posted menu from yesterdat. I like the thought that this minimizes waste. Rather than tossing tons of food daily, you get a few options that assist the undecisive customer and in the meantime prevent tons of wasted food. So, kudos to them!  My guess is that since the menu is ever changing and if you don't have Facebook or Instagram, it's best to call ahead to find out what they have for the day.",

Think lots of beans legumes and savory veggie items.  They always have a couple salads on board too which looked pretty standard.   I went with a full plate plus a full salad which was delightful. They use a flavor palate that played with ginger coconut basil and turmeric. Yes that sort of thing.   The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The vibe is relaxed and the al fresco dining is quite relaxed. There is a heavy peace and eco feel to the place. It is not full service so you'll be putting away your own plates.

To my surprise, the food served here was delicious!  On the day I went in, they were offering a wrap, vegan soup, coffee hummus, and a few other options. When I told them that I had never been in before, I was offered a few samples. I really liked them all but ended up getting a half wrap, teriyaki rice pilaf, and the potato salad. For a plate of three items, it was $10+tax.  The wrap and sides were all really filling and flavorful. All the veggies were super crisp and everything tasted fresh & healthy. I wasn't able to finish three items so I'd only get a half wrap with one side (or any two items) next time. It seemed a bit on the expensive side, but overall a good choice for lunch.",

The owner kindly welcomed me, explained the daily changing menu and served me a sample platter of literally everything she had. And literally everything tasted delicious. Vegan or not, this is a magical kitchen to visit! The owner and I talked for a bit and I came to really admire her and the kitchen's philosophy of intuitive cooking in which no menu is set until the day of and no measurements are really made.

I brought my meat-loving husband who really loved the lentil wrap and ginger potato salad. Great iced tea with free refills. And I found out this place does catering- good to know.

Overall, a cute little down-to-earth deli on Mill, with a small but tasty made-from-scratch menu which changes daily.  No in-house seating, but there is a decent outdoor seating area; there are cooling misters, but in the summer you may want to just grab-n-go.  I had the Thai wrap with honey mustard potato salad, and I wasn't disappointed.  The wrap was loaded with rice, beans, greens, and a touch of peanut sauce.  The potato salad was not your run-of-the-mill either, with tasty bits of carrot and celery mixed in.  Since the website is still under construction, I was told to check them out on Facebook for the current menu:  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FDesertRootsKitchen&s=316207d3eb014826ff338cc9731cbb75c2024202bb7ae5fd97f3408e1f519210\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">facebook.com/DesertRoots...</a>   Overall, a win for us vegetarians/vegans, with gluten and dairy free choices as well.

Found this through yelp, but almost missed the place because it's tucked back in a courtyard off the street. So happy we persevered and found the restaurant! I can't even begin to describe our experience. We were warmly greeted by multiple members of the staff, then guided through our ordering process. We had a red beet and apple salad, bagel with cream cheese for the pickiest kid, parfait with dark granola and fresh fruit, smokey mac n cheese, a buffalo lentil wrap, citrus cilantro pilaf and hummus with sides of fresh veggies. Because we had children with us and ordered the mac n cheese, the guy behind the counter made sure we knew it was a bit spicy. He also let us customize the veggies to go with our hummus.  The food was ready almost as fast as I ordered it. The few things that were not immediately ready were delivered to our table within a few minutes by yet another very friendly employee and with edible flowers to boot! The kids enjoyed their food so much we got another bagel and parfait. The sides and half wrap were perfect portions for me and my husband.  We spent a little over a week eating our way through Phoenix and Sedona and this was a favorite with most of our party of five!",

I had a simple pasta with a small salad, yet the flavors were full and fun. Fittingly, as with the food, the vibe of the cafe was organic as well, an outdoor patio lush with plants.

This place is good for takeout or eating outside on their covered patio.  There's no indoor seating so fortunately the weather was good and we ate outside.  This is a walk up counter ordering place so no waitstaff.  They had tofu scrambled burritos and about a half dozen items in a large deli case which you can try before order.  There's also a chalk board menu.  We had a Thai Peanut burrito, pasta and a pineapple Thai brown rice dish.  They also had fresh confetti cookies just out of the oven so we tried those.  Overall it was good and healthy food.  Owner is very willing to accommodate your wishes!",

This Saturday, I walked in a little after 2:30 (they close at 3:00) and had the warmest welcome and let me mention it was a warm welcome even before they knew I was a take away order!  Leslie and a man (didn't catch his name) waited on me and were so extremely friendly!! Excellent customer service! Now, for the food-so, so good!! Everything is super fresh and so much flavor! I opted for the cheesy peas and the bbq dill sides with a lentil wrap! It was all good, but the bbq dill pinto bean salad was amazing!!!! Smoky, dill, a little heat!! So, so, so good!! This place is definitely a must try!!!!",

They were kind, efficient, and Leslie even sent me home with welcome goodies. This place is where it's at especially if your vegan. I mean the food is scrumptious regardless of your meal preference and I think anyone would agree with that! But it's nice being vegan and knowing you have a place where everything is made for you. They made a fan and loyal customer out of me today. I cannot wait to go back.",

    "text": "This counter-serve plant-based restaurant in downtown Tempe packs a lot of flavor in a small space. The menu changes every day (check Instagram), but is usually full of interesting options including wraps, pasta salads, rice dishes, hummus (usually multiple types), green salads and other vegan options. You order based on how many items you want. I normally get half a wrap and one or two sides, depending on what's available. Most recently, I got a half herb lentil wrap that included rice and lettuce, along with a side of peanut curry rigatoni. You can try items before deciding, which is good because some of the items are very spicy. Whatever you get will be healthy, tasty and vegan!  I love how fresh everything they serve is. I've never had a bad meal. However, they have limited hours (just breakfast and lunch), and typically they are only open during weekdays. It can be hard to get to if you don't work or live in Tempe. They are experimenting with being open on Saturdays now though! They also sell frozen pupusas from my favorite vegan pupusa vendor La PupuSarita. And, there's free one-hour parking at the Hayden Square parking garage just west of Mill (behind the restaurant).   The service is always friendly and helpful. The only downside is that there is no indoor seating. The dining patio is shaded and has misters on during the summer, but it's best to get the food to-go during the summer heat.",

I work in the area so it is hard to find healthy food on mill. For a healthy place the options seemed to be mostly carbs - potatoes, pasta, rice. I am not a vegan but I do want to eat less carbs. The options are limited so I got a half wrap with a side of curry peas for $9 since this seemed like the only available option that wasn't more carbs. The wrap was also heavy on the lettuce. The flavors were bland. Everything is cold which is nice for summer, however it is a little cold outside. I just did not really like the food here. So this place is overall really frustrating for a person trying to eat healthy.",

I try to eat vegetarian for most meals and it can be tricky finding something that I look forward to, as most options are salads or visiting ChopShop.   When you visit, it's a \"pastry case\" of the food that is made fresh daily that you can choose from. The menu changes daily, so if you want to easily know what's on the menu before visiting you can visit their Instagram. I almost always order a full wrap, which is priced at $11, and comes with a side. Yeah, it's pretty steep for a lunch price, but I typically space it out for two meals by bringing my own side salad. Plus, it's hard finding a healthy lunch for less than that in downtown Tempe!   For me, the food is always delicious so it's worth it once a week or every other week. During the summer heat, the food is great because it's served chilled. The owner is always working and if you subscribe to their newsletter they offer deals. I definitely recommend! Support local",

I don't know, do we want sh*tty pizza or a sh*tty burger or some sh*tty Mexican food?  Enter: Desert Roots Kitchen, the tiny, unassuming kitchen of fresh awesome... now, I never have to have this conversation again.  With offerings like huge wraps, awesome dolmas, cous cous salads, noodle dishes, greens, fresh fruit, granola and yogurt parfaits, and baked goods like brownies, cookies and bars, it's reassuring to know that most everything is vegan (even the white chocolate chips in the cookies and the soy yogurt they have available for parfaits) but not particularly surprising. It's all very simple, natural food. No Tofurky isht. Not up in here.  The staff is friendly, helpful, enthusiastic, and most importantly, willing to let you sample things. I ended up with the vegan parfait for a anti-whopping fee of 3.50... the same price as Nami's! Except, Desert Roots uses fresh, seasonal fruit instead if a scoop of frozen berries, gives you about twice as much soy yogurt (but if only they had coconut milk yogurt...), and their lightly honey-sweetened homemade granola actually keeps breakfast nutritious, rather than turning it into a total sugar bomb. I'll definitely be ordering the parfait on da regular.  While we're on the subject of carbs, I'd love to see some additional grainless menu items, because as of now, it's entirely carb-based. I enjoy the idea of pasta and cous cous as much as the next person, but I'd rather not eat much of it, let alone make it my meal. Also, stuffing a flour-based wrap with grains is not on my bucket list. Plus, if I get dessert (and I am getting dessert, damn it), that's flour on rice on flour. Yikes. Hook me up with some vegetable/nut/legume-centric dishes and I'll be an ecstatic camper in the future. Keep the good stuff coming, y'all, keep it coming.",

Since moving to Tempe a few months ago, I am constantly on the lookout for new vegan/vegetarian spots. However, due to their very limited hours, I have never had a chance to make a visit to Desert Roots Kitchen until today.  I didn't immediately notice the restaurant from Mill Avenue because it is tucked away in a little square right behind the big store-fronts on the main sidewalk. Phew! This quaint, quiet location is totally befitting of their style of restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised at how calm the environment was considering its proximity to Mill Avenue in the middle of a school day. The front of the store has some patio seating where customers were easily able to sit undisturbed and read or chat over their meals.   Upon entering, the staff was responsive and very positive. I told them it was my first visit and they explained the menu and encouraged me to sample the food before ordering anything. ...Don't mind if I do!!   Everything I tasted was delicious, fresh, and made from scratch that same day. I ended up getting the Fresh Veggie & Kale Wrap with Lentils and their Garden Herb Spread. It came with a side of fruit, and the size of the wrap was very generous... I'm saving half of it for lunch tomorrow.  It was delicious. The flavors came together very well, and just thinking about those ingredients gives me a nice healthy feeling... a feeling that you don't frequently have after dining on the normal ice cream/burger/pizza fare served up at almost every other one of the restaurants on Mill. I'm incredibly happy with this new health-conscious, vegetarian-friendly addition to a shopping district that was in such desperate need of it.  Now go check it out!!",

It's located in the cove at Mill&5th, which keeps the noise level down, and has a great covered patio for eating/conversing/reading/relaxing etc. The staff is super helpful and friendly (I had no idea what to get the first time I went, but one of the owners kindly explained all that was being offered that day and what other people had recommended). Oh, and the food is amazing too. The menu changes daily and the food is fresh, bright, and light on both palate and wallet. For a special treat stop by on Taco Thursdays for a unique take on an old favorite.    Also I've left plenty of restaurants feeling good, because I just ate a really tasty meal, but it's rare for me to leave a restaurant feeling good about the restaurant itself. The people that run Desert Roots Kitchen care about what they're feeding their customers and it shows.  *Update* I need to say something about the vegan baked goods at Desert Roots. I've had some bad experiences with animal friendly baked items in the past (see overly dry and tough), but the cookies, brownies, muffins and dessert bread at Desert Roots are excellent. All the baked stuff is very moist with the right amount of chew vs. crumbliness. Also, like the rest of the menu it seems like new treats are whipped up every week, but there are some additional mainstays, like the oh-so-amazing apple oat bars,  that remain in the lineup.",

I have lived here since 2006, been on Mill a million times, and still had never seen the courtyard this place is in until I went looking for it. Love the blueberry tea! And they let you try samples which is really cool, that way you can test out some of the inventive menu items before you order them.

This is a small kitchen hidden in the back corner of a little interior mall on Mill, serving the best vegan fare you can find around town. They have a small covered patio to enjoy your food outside. Every day the menu is different, and the dishes the chefs make are all inspired from their individual, unique talents. There aren't any recipe books, just artists following their flow. They make everything fresh, with ingredients from local farms, and the folks who work there are the real deal. Everyone is so friendly and just naturally make you feel welcome. On your first visit, you'll feel like a long lost friend; one of the family. They're not trying to be found, but if you find them, you'll be glad you did. Those of you who think you can't get full on vegan, just try a full plate. I have friends visiting for Spring Training next week and will blow their minds bringing them here",

The hummus was also fabulous.  The dish is so large, I was able to share it (and not even finish the wrap).  That saved us a bit of cash.

The cafe, which has been open for about the past 5 months, is hidden in the plaza off of 5th St. and features a great case of vegetarian dishes, such as pasta salad, pumpkin pudding and dolmas. The spot also serves coffee and breakfast items and a changing daily special, which I got when I went there recently--the pinto bean wrap, with brown rice and peppers.  The joint is order-at-the-counter, and there's a little patio outside where you can nosh. Getting my food was super-quick, and the staff was very friendly. Most meals cost only around $10, and you can build your own meal with a variety of sides, an option I loved since everything looked so good. My pasta salad was really tasty, and the wrap packed a protein punch and was really filling. While the spot doesn't currently serve dinner, the manager I talked to said she anticipated dinner hours in the near-future.",

I really loved the simplicity of the menu (not too many options) but each food option had unique-seeming flavor combinations and seemed well thought out.  The day I came, they were serving a delicious artichoke jalapeno rice pilaf and fun lentil dishes.  I ordered a 2-item plate and chose the rice pilaf as well as a green chile potato salad that I didn't love.  However, I loved the flavors and would definitely come back again.  The iced teas are delicious too!  Definitely come and give this place a visit :).",

    "text": "A rotating menu consisting of A wrap of the day and many \"sides\" which are really dishes in themselves.   It had been some time since I had venture to this little courtyard hidden away from the hustle and bustle of mill. I was glad to see a small shop brining it back to life. There is a covered patio with a few chairs and inside a counter to order at. (this means summer time may be a problem)  The are a few options including a wrap 1/2 wrap with a side two sides or just many sides. Again the sides are well crafted dishes in their own right and not just chips.   I tried 1/2 of a warrior wrap which was filled with pinto beans and cactus in a green tortilla. It was pretty good which is high praise as I am not a wrap fan. The real star was the peanut and bok choy salad I had with my dish. Rich and great texture.   I was also pleased with the prices, $6.50 for a 1/2 wrap and a side is a bargain compared to other local organic veg places.   If the weather is nice, you can't go wrong by trying this place out.",

I had the blood orange and ginger dressing which was an absolute delight for the taste buds.  I quickly googled a recipe to try and recreate the dressing at home.

Most of the people there were extremely nice and friendly, but there was one woman who was putting the food together that was so incredibly rude to me.   The couple before me sampled a couple of foods and the woman was very polite to them, even cracking jokes. She gave them a ton of food and sent them merrily on their way. When it got to my turn, she took her sweet time putting ~15 signs in front of the food and ignoring me, asking me to wait multiple times when I hadn't said anything and was just staring from her to the menu. Then, when she finally decided she was ready for my order, she was really rude and seemed like she was so much better than me. Honestly, all I wanted to do was eat brunch in between my classes and I got that with a side of rude service.  Anyways, on to the food. It is SO good and VERY filling. I got the burrito/wrap thing with cauliflower, quinoa and lettuce. It was delicious and I felt so healthy afterwards. I also got their iced green tea which was also really refreshing. I don't really like tortillas, so next time, I think I'm just going to get the plate where you can get a combination of different things.   Everything they make is really good and they seem to be passionate about the food and their restaurant. With the exception of this one woman, I really enjoyed Desert Roots Kitchen.",

It's not very often I get hankerings for the food at one restaurant which can't be satisfied anywhere else on Earth (I used to get that with Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles, until they realized that most middle-class white people have no palates, and the quality started slipping).  If you bothered to read the above parenthetical remark, you'll note that I am not even a vegan. I'd *like* to be a vegan, because large scale farming processes are usually inhumane, but it's just hard to find the wide variety of culinary experience I enjoy when completely excluding animal products from my diet. That's why Desert Roots is so great: their food just tastes great. It's unique. And you're not going to get the same meal twice. Even if I didn't *want* to be vegan, I'd still eat here as often as I can.  The way the place works is as follows: 1) You walk in the door, and look at the items available for the day. 2) You go with the wrap-of-the-day, because it's going to be awesome, unless you're that person who inexplicably hated the wrap, yet her only other review was glowing praise of the super-shitty Green. 3) You nearly go mad because you're too indecisive to pick which other two items you want out of the four or five sides that look totally delicious. And you want the hummous too! Aargh! 4) You enjoy the hell out of your meal.  That's really all there is to it. This is just well-seasoned, fresh, home-grown food that's not gimmicky, not oversauced, and not something you'll easily find in any other restaurant.",

Not only is the food fresh made daily and soooo delicious but the staff here is totally worth going for...Heck I even give them all 5 stars for not being open all the times that I want to go there...limited hours closing at 4pm M-F. Not open weekends darn it!!  I love the small outdoor seating with the foliage...it's quite a relaxing place to sit and do nothing but eat! Tucked away inside so you can't see it from simply driving down Mill Ave. Park in the garage off 5th street for 1 hour of free parking and you can walk right into the courtyard where the restaurant is.  I LOVE this place!! Give it a try, even non-vegans will love the healthy tasty treats! Be sure to ask for a sample if one wasn't already offered to you. I drive 30 minutes to get here and Id drive further...but please don't move farther!! You could open another location and make me twice as happy!!

Of course, I had to try it along with a half wrap and the roasted veggies. My meal was topped with locally grown sprouts.  The only down side to eating here today was the outside seating because it was hot outside. It will definitely be a place to come back when the weather cools down. The patio was cute, tucked in a little courtyard in a shopping center on Mill Avenue in downtown Tempe.  Be sure to check in on Yelp for a free iced tea, which was also very good.",

    "text": "Delicious fresh food. Normally not a fan of this kind of vegan blah blah stuff but this was excellent! Had a half wrap and two different salads. $10! The guy behind the counter gave me some samples of the different salads to try, they were all excellent and they change everyday! The guy serving was really friendly, laid back and polite and told me all about the ingredients and where they came from. Definitely a must try place if you are in Tempe for lunch during the week. Will definitely be back",

    "text": "This place is a hidden gem on tucked away just off of Mill Avenue in Tempe and definitely my favorite Vegan restaurant in the Phoenix metropolitan area.  The menu is constantly changing so it's always a surprise as to what your options are going to be but I have not had anything there that I did not love (and they let you sample if you are unsure).  The food always taste fresh and you have a variety of interesting dishes to choose from that you are not going to find anywhere else.  The staff there is always super friendly and Leslie is a machine in the kitchen. You can tell she  puts so much love and takes so much pride in the food she makes and you can taste it. I would recommend this place to anyone. Seating is all outside but they have misters to help keep you cool or you can always take your meal to go. My only complaint is that I wish they were open longer during the day and on weekends but that's just me being selfish because I want to eat there all the time :)",

DRK met that criterion. food was really delicious and was very fresh. plenty of flavor and filling enough to satisfy my non-primal usual urges. great alternative to the everyday type of meal. I had a wrap - well prepared and had a wonderful texture. side of quinoa - was good, too! oh, and BRING UR DOG!!!",

    "text": "This place is a breath of fresh air in Tempe, litterally! Their food is not only all vegan, but it's fresh and amazing.... Everything is made  from scratch and with love. They allow the ingredients to shine, not covering up the beautiful grains and veggies with \"chi'kn\" replacements....believe me, vegan food does not have to mimic carnivore food in order to be delicious.  Everyday the menu is slightly different (actually, a good indication that their ingredients are indeed fresh and real) so, it's always a surprise to see what you are going to get. I have to say though, pesto day (whateverdays they decide to make it) is my absolute favorite...(maybe they can give me the recipe?? :D  ) Each day there is a different wrap made that you can combine with the wonderful variety of side dishes they make. Or, you can just make a full plate out of the side dishes. The people there are also wonderful, you can tell they put a lot of love in their food! Always smiling and happy to serve you, I never get tired of going here!",

This place is healthful and a great choice away from a heavy burger or some of the other more noticeable places on Mill. I highly recommend this place and the staff of the restaurant was helpful in making my choices.",
