The manager (who I swear to God is Stanley Tucci's twin -- which won over my Devil Wears Prada loving heart -- he even did an impression for me that made my night!), the waiters are fun, and go a great job. And even though Mill Avenue is dead and gone - it's nice to be down by ASU and see that some places are doing well. I'm crossing my fingers for the day that Mill is revitalized and the streets are lined with people like they used to be!  Try: Ginger Chicken, Orange Chicken & Chicken Lettuce Wraps",

After promptly being sat at a table with a view of Mill Street's finest, we were greeted warmly by our server, Lauren. I was  on the fence about ordering a cocktail, but Lauren suggested trying the Rockin' Berry martini and HOLY COW was it divine. We ordered our usual appetizers, but really wanted to branch out for dinner. Lauren sensed our apprehension and made a few recommendations from the new items on their menu. My date and I went with the Topical Sea Bass and Orange Peel Beef, which were two of the dishes she mentioned. Lauren really had a great attitude, was super friendly and we appreciated that she was always one step ahead. Food is always great, but this kind of service is why we will be back for more!",

It is so cruel to send food over them without them being able to do what they love and long to do. Seriously, I've had finer dining at a $8 all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet.   The Mongolian beef is to die for... I'm going to die 'for I ever have to eat it again. It's not that it's just a smidge bland, I've had spicier Big Macs, it was that it was drowning in a pool of brownish blandy sauce. I had to pepper my Mongolian beef! DID YOU HEAR THAT? Genghis and Kublai are very disappointed. I think maybe even a tear or 2. And the plum sauce for the Moo Shu pork was gawdawful. Scrape it off!!! My tongue hurts. Now the orange chicken wasn't too bad and maybe even moderately okay.   Now the service I had most recently, this one on Mill, (I've been to 2 different muthuh PFers just in case) was not all that great. The guy was a big stick but with a d instead of the st, ya get it? huh? huh? get it? But that's hit or miss at any chain.  And then the bill! I haven't felt that violated since grade school. Same kind of bad taste but only money was taken this time. It's one thing to pay a moderate amount for good food with good atmosphere but this place is just Panda Express in trendy clothes.   I should have gone to Taco Bell.",

It's those extra things that show a lot about a place. Clearly, they are constantly paying attention to their customers needs and they are doing a great job at overseeing everything that is going on. I wish more places were like this, excellent customer service is hard to come by these days. Way to go PF Chang's!",

Last night we had reservations for a certain time and being that it was a typical busy Friday night we had to wait about 10 minutes (which was really no big deal for us). The manager, Jewls, personally came over to get our drink order started. Our server, Alex, was a sweetheart; very friendly and nice. Totally on top of the refills! Despite having a party of over 40 people seated next to us, our food order was not delayed at all. After we ate the manager came by again to let us know she comped our appetizers since we had to wait to be seated! What a nice surprise and excellent customer service. The only negative (which has nothing to do with the restaurant) is that you have to pay for downtown parking and it's at a premium on the busy weekend evening. You may have to walk a block or two. Cheers!!!  UPDATE: We were here this weekend and Alex was our server again. He was just as sweet and charming. My mom accidentally left her CC on the table and realized it the next day. Alex made sure it got to the manager and put in the safe. Thanks Alex!!",

    "text": "We went here for dinner tonight before going to Wicked, and I have to say it was probably one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.   There were five of us; 4 adults and one kid with food allergies.   Usually, when going to a restaurant no one, including the servers, seem to have any idea what on the menu would be good for someone with food allergies. They hem and haw and guess at things. This doesn't work so well for someone with severe allergies. We explained our issue to our server, Lauren, who said she would get the manager who would print out a special menu for us. That's right, a special menu. So over comes the manager, Jeff Jensen. We tell him that our kid has peanut and egg allergies, and he leaves and comes back with a specially printed out menu that has basically a list of everything on their menu that is safe for someone with those specific allergies. I have NEVER had a restaurant do that before. Absolutely amazing customer service. Both our server and the manager came back a couple times to make sure everything worked out ok with the special menu, not just to make sure the rest of the food was good. Major kudos to both Lauren and Jeff!  Now about the food: The oolong marinated Chilean Sea Bass is one of my favourite dishes there. The sauce is fantastic, the fish is tender and flavourful, and the fresh, wilted spinach is the perfect veggie for it. Salt and pepper prawns are great too. Appetisers: get the calamari, fried green beans or crab wontons and you won't be disappointed. For dessert, the tres leches lemon dream (either the mini or full size) is just the right balance of sweet and tart.  Our service was outstanding and fast, even with the restaurant being packed right before the show. Our food was great. All in all it was simply a great night!",

    "text": "I hate to admit this, but I liked PF Chang's.  Before you go and lose all respect for me, keep in mind, this is coming from a vegetarian's perspective, whose choices at most chain restaurants are a salad with iceberg lettuce drenched in dressing with more calories than super sized fries at Mickey D's, and a minestrone soup that may or may not be made with beef broth.  PF Chang's at least, 1. recognizes vegetarians by offering a decent variety of veggie dishes, 2. labels them well, and most importantly, 3. tastes good.   We were able to sample the majority of the veggie menu.  The chow fun was the weakest dish on the table--your standard noodles--but the lettuce wraps, coconut curry, and stir fried eggplant were all delicious.  They also offer brown rice, which is a huge plus.  My only gripes were that the seating was cramped, and there was a bit of a wait for a table.  Other than that, the prices are affordable, and the service was prompt and helpful.     I'm all for the mom-and-pop businesses, but for what it is--a chain serving Americanized Chinese food--as a last resort, and as a vegetarian, or just someone who's conscious of their diet, you sure could do a hell of a lot worse.",

Trendy is another way of saying \"long wait\" and \"stupid employees\".  The Olive Garden : Italian food :: PF Chang's : Chinese food analogy doesn't even work here.  And I make fun of Olive Garden ALL the time.  If you are really determined to get mediocre Chinese food, find a Pei Wei.  It's owned by the same family and is the same food but for less.  And if you're looking for a Pei Wei in Tempe, AZ, just go to Tott's Asian Diner.  It's in the same strip mall and it's way way better.",

Shared the Salt and Pepper Prawns and Shrimp Fried Rice, and both were delicious. I've always liked their food. No, it's not the greatest or most original Asian food around, but it's pretty good. It's the service that I've struggled with - but if they're able to maintain the level they displayed the other day, I will definitely continue to grace their restaurant with my presence. Ha!  Oh, also told our waiter about my fortune-less fortune cookie on my last visit, and he apologized profusely, said they got a bad batch last month in which one out of every three cookies was empty. The problem had been resolved, he assured me, and sure enough this time I got a fortune. Not a very good one, something about me having a deep appreciation of the arts and music (Well, duh), but hey, it was a fortune. Sort of. Ok, not really. But it was a saying on a little piece of paper, which was all I really wanted..",

We had veggie dumplings to start, and I am a little disappointed that they've changed them from 6 small dumplings to 4 large ones. The large ones just don't cook up the same way and were not nearly as good. Bummer.   They have a few new things on the menu, one of them being Dali Chicken. I had this, and it was really tasty. Chicken stir fried with potatoes and red chiles....it's hard to screw that up! Surprisingly, this dish ended up being really spicy, which was a nice change from Chinese food posing as spicy when the peppers are really just for decoration.   Dad ordered the ginger chicken. It was good too, but it sure wasn't anything special.   Bottom line: There isn't anything here that you couldn't find in a Martin Yan cookbook and make 10x better, and cheaper.",

I was here visiting from out of town and they had plenty of these locations all over the US so I was familiar with the name.  Wow was this placed packed! It didn't seem like a rush hour of the day but this place nearly had every table occupied. I had to wait a short while for a table to be ready but that was understandable. The restaurant already smelled great from all the delicious food so I was eagerly waiting to be seated.  Once I sat down I was greeted by our friendly waiter who explained to me most of the popular dishes since this was my first time there. I decided on the honey seared chicken with rice and enjoyed a bowl of soup before the meal was brought out.  When we were served our meal, the presentation was great. The food tasted great as well. The chicken was cooked perfect, the outside has a nice crunch with a tender inside. The honey seared chicken sauce tasted great as well!  The only thing was that we wanted more refills with our drinks but the waiter didn't come back to our table very often after the meal was served to us. Not much of a gripe but the over all experience was very enjoyable!",

Why is it that places like PF Chang's are considered \"like, oh my god, sooo good!\"? Why?   I mean, the food is edible. It has flavor. The  menu offers variety. You get to eat your food in a comfortable setting with somebody waiting on you, refilling your glass, clearing the table... And then you get to go back to your ordinary lives.  Ok, so maybe I'm being a little too hard on PF Chang's. I'm not the first person to diss chain restaurants. I'm not even the first to secretly admit to liking a few. I do. But, when given the option of exploring a local eatery that sells more than the \"paint by numbers\" entrees, I'll pick the original, exciting and off-the-beaten-path place 99.4% of the time.",

I was here a little over a year ago and had a good experience as well but with so many places to earnings the Phoenix area I just haven't made it back. So glad I did.   Brought my mom and girlfriend here for lunch beige an afternoon matinee. They are doing work on the patio out front which could fool you to think its closed but its not, obviously, and it is supposed to be done in a week.   To the food, appetizers of chicken lettuce wraps, pork dumplings, and pork egg rolls. The lettuce wraps were complimentary since it was their first visit. The wraps live up to their reputation and I found myself skipping the lettuce and just scooping heaping portions of chicken into my mouth with the serving spoon. Lol. Can't be wasting time with prep ya know. Dumplings were frickin awesome, again, pan seared, and cannot think of another restaurant that makes them as good. The seasoning and sauce with just a little heat was perfection. Egg rolls were good. They were caked in grease like so many other places and they weren't dry.   Between the three if us we had the Kung Pao Chicken, Sesame Chicken, and. Broccoli Beef. Again, not a disappointment among them. I can eat. And I did. I was waiting for one of my luncheon companions to slap my hand or stab it with their fork but it didn't happen. I was perfectly content and ate just right without feeling miserably full, and then I looked at the dessert menu. You wouldn't expect to see things like Tiramasu, various cheesecake, and even Wontons made dessert style. Had to try the blueberry cheesecake and it was delicious.   To top it all off the manager came over tongue table and have us all $10 gift cards since my mom and girlfriend hadn't been here before. Was totally relieved and impressed to finally be able to write a raving review.",

    "text": "This last visit, we made reservations for 8pm for a party of 10, celebrating a birthday. The restaurant was about 3/4 full, yet they didnt seat us until 8:15pm. The hostesses were rather apathetic about the whole thing, and were saying we just needed to wait for people to leave, instead of them pushing some open tables together.  Our server was great, but a bit overwhelmed by himself doing a table of 10, which is understandable. It took 1hr 15min for our entrees to all come out. This was frustrating since by the time our food came out, the restaurant was about 1/3 full... so this wasnt at a peak time.   I wasnt going to complain, since we were just trying to have a good birthday, and were just gonna chalk this up to a off night in the kitchen. But this changed when the manager came by and asked us how our night had been. When I told her the food was good, but it took an 1hr 15min for us to all get our entrees, she decided to tell me I was wrong. I told her about our late seating even though we had a reservation, and she proceeded to tell me I was wrong about that as well, saying we were sat at 8:07pm. She then argued that since we ordered appetizers... which took forever to come out as well, that was why our food was late. I told her that since she knew all the answers, and that I was obviously just lying to her, that I didnt understand why she even asked us how our service was.  They comped our table 3 small desserts as a way to remedy the situation... Which was underwhelming. I feel for our waiter, because the manager seemed to give him a hard time, which we made sure to clarify he did nothing wrong.  Long story short... The management doesnt understand the definition of customer service. The food is good though, but its not worth going back to. Plenty of other places that we will have birthdays and large gatherings at.",

    "text": "We love P.F. Chang's but man did our server ruin our experience today.   3 big fails:  1) I ordered shrimp with candied walnuts. There were not any walnuts and they didn't  toss the dish in its usual sauce. So I got soggy fried shrimp with balls of lemon. I brought it up to the server and he went to ask the kitchen. A few moment later he returned and said that they had run out of those ingredients, and walked away. Now, Ideally it would be nice to know that you were out of ingredients of a dish I ordered prior to ordering it but I get it, shit happens. Here was my issue: After clearly seeing my disappointment when the dish was delivered he just walked away. Really? You're not going to give me the option to order something else? Maybe substitute the ingredient for something else? Anything? So much for customer satisfaction.   Now I'm with my lady and she's the type that never complains because she gets embarrassed by the scene. I get it. I hate complaining myself. So as annoyed as I am I shut up and eat the mediocre dish without my two favorite ingredients. He was nowhere to be seen for a while so I wasn't going to chase after him.  2) There was fruit flies swimming in the soy sauce. Seriously. I showed it to the server and he just picks it up and says, \"oh ya that is gross\" and takes it away. I can't make this shit up. He didn't offer to bring another one over, he didn't apologize, he didn't do anything that you would normally expect. I felt like I was experiencing culture shock.    3) How long does it take to get change? Did you go out for a smoke or something? If you're reading this you should find a new profession because you're a garbage server.    Side note w/ positivity. The calamari is always amazing and her chicken lo mein was perfect. It's a classy casual tasty chain worth checking out. Hope you have a better experience than I did!",

I went to a local restaurant (pf changs, right on mill) to do some work and de-stress.   The day was a pretty tough one for me, it was the anniversary of my mothers death. We used to always eat at pf changs together.   I ordered our favorite, lettuce wraps. They ended up bringing me veggie lettuce wraps instead of chicken, but it was so damn good I didn't even notice!!!! Next think I know the waiter brings out the chicken lettuce wraps, and let's me keep the veggie ones.   Moral of the story, it was nice to be sitting there with two plates of food. Made me feel like my mom was there in a way. I probably wouldn't have ordered anything else, so wouldn't have had that feeling if they didn't \"goof up\" my order. Little did they know they made my day.   The service was amazing. : ) definitely a must in Tempe.",

    "text": "Ok so it's a chain, but a reliable one. I came in around 2:00 pm on a Monday afternoon and the place was surprisingly crowded for a very late lunch hour. I grabbed one of several open seats at the bar and looked over the menu.   One thing I like about this chain is they frequently change up the menu just enough to make it interesting. The old favorites are still there, but a few fresh, new items show us as well.   Today, I decided to try one of these called Chang's Spicy Chicken. It was excellent. The server, a very nice girl named Brittany, asked me how I'd like my \"special sauce.\" Mild, medium, or hot? I went with hot, and had the privilege of watching her make it right in front of me.   And it was hot, but not too hot. Not the kinda hot where you need to grab the water glass. But I guess fire tolerances are relative. So maybe take a little sample first.   Had a hot & sour soup ahead of time, which came with the meal. It was also very good.   Like all PF Chang's, this is a nice & hip environment. The main drawback, which is not the restaurant's fault, is all the drunks that come into the place. Several servers told me it was a recurring problem, and I witnessed one while I was there.   This guy came in, sat at the bar, got up, stumbled through one side of the dining room and the other. Then went into the restrooms, then came out, then sat at the bar again. Babbled in a language that can only be described as Drunkese, then was finally asked to leave.   Lunch and a show.   But overall, a fantastic experience and very friendly and professional staff. I'd come back in a heartbeat.",

The floor was disgusting. It was covered in food. I watched someone clear a table and just push the food onto the floor. No one came by and swept it up. It wasn't just one part of the restaurant. There was food all over the entire floor and this is no exaggeration. It was really gross and off-putting.   There are other restaurants to go to down on Mill that are much cleaner.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I just had a very frustrating and degrading experience at the P.F. Chang's on Mill and University. We ordered an appetizer and our meals. The appetizer came and halfway through eating it, I noticed a small, black object sitting in the food. I asked Michael what it was and he said it looked like an olive. I picked it up and it was an ear bud, like the ones that connect to earphones. The server noticed we weren't eating and came over. We explained what we found in our food and she said she would bring the manager over right away. The manager came and said this has never happened before. He was very apologetic and ashamed. He said that obviously they would take care of the situation. He asked if there was anything else he could do and I said that I didn't feel right eating there after what happened. He said he understood, and insisted that we at least take the food to go. Reluctantly, we agreed. He told the server to box up the food. When she came back, she set down the bill. We were confused by it because they took off the appetizer but were going to charge us for the food that we didn't eat or want. We were at a loss for words that they were going to charge us for the food we didn't eat. We left the bag of food on the table with the check, unpaid for. As we approached the door, two employees, who must have been unaware of the situation, chased after us and accused us of walking out on our bill. We explained that we spoke to the manager and that there was a problem with our food. One employee said she was going to find the manager to confirm this was the case. The other employee stood at the door. As other customers watched, he assured them that he was just \"watching these two\" (referring to me and Michael). The manager ran over and apologized for the employees and said that we were not supposed to be charged, and that the server who gave us our bill was in the wrong. At this point, we were embarrassed and disgusted- not only about the ear bud in the food, but now the service. Clearly a lack of sanitation, customer service, and communication amongst the staff. We won't be supporting this restaurant any longer.",

I can honestly say, we will never come here again for any reason. Nor would I ever encourage anyone to eat here.  What has happened to P.F. Chang's???  I mean honestly! We were greeted by the hostess who put us at a nice table by the window. After sitting down I could see the table was dirty. There was grease all over it and I had a dirty plate in my area. When Kinnesy came to tell us she would be helping us out tonight. I asked if we could get the table wiped down and I showed her the grease all over it. She did come back and wipe it down,then disappeared, in her place came over a male server, who then told us he would be taking care of us instead.  He seemed good at first. He told us about a few things on the menu.  I got hot Tea and my friend got Ice Tea, they had Mango and regular.  He ordered regular. About an hour later he had to ask for another Ice Tea, he got it but, it was Mango. We got the 2 for $40.00, which does not include your drinks. It came with soup.  Somewhere after we received the lettuce wraps things went downhill. We never got any appetizer plates. We had to ask for them. That is OK because, things like that can happen. Then another server brought us out our main dishes. 2 meals one bowl of white rice. We had both ordered Brown rice. Again no Dinner plates. We had to ask for those as well. We never even got any water to drink. I have to say in all the time we sat there waiting for everything, I really noticed how dirty the floor was.  They would just wipe the floors down and paper ,rice, food, everything right on to the floor.  They were not even busy here, there were 11 tables occupied ours being one of them. There were 5 servers. We waited and Waited, and waited for the dessert to come out. I really wanted it to go at this point we had been there for 1 and half hours. I was so ready to go. It was a simple meal that took forever. The hostess had to go to find the waiter to tell him we wanted our check. I could see him in the doorway of the Kitchen eating. Just give us our dessert and check and we will be out of here like 25 min ago. The dessert were Wontons that had been micro waved. They were hard and the mixture inside was bubbling. Gross! We waited so long that we finally just left the $$$ on the Table and left. I have to say it was my very worst dining experience.",

    "text": "They were promoting a 20% off take-out special, so we ordered a few dishes to see what the buzz is about.  I have eaten there 1 other time for lunch.  They had a \"seasonal\" chicken curry that was to die for. But, they discontinued it, of course.  Anyway, we ordered the Saigon fresh rolls, which were okay but the sauce made no sense.  They put fresh veggies in there, lemongrass chicken and Thai basil, which I couldnt taste, and peanuts.  Why not serve it with Thai sauces?  They came with a bland creamy sesame sauce that didn't taste like sesame.   We also ordered egg rolls, which came with a yellow mustard with mayonnaise sauce.  Barf.  I asked for sweet and sour and hot mustard, but got packets.  We also got curried vegetables and added chicken.  Again, the sauce was bland beyond belief and had the color of chinese mustard.  The bok choy was so chewy, I had to spit it out.  I asked for extra spicy, but it was so mild, a 2 year old could eat it.  They did throw in some packets of chili sauce.  I guess that's what extra spicy means to them.  Also, sweet and sour pork.  Sigh.  Strange sauce that was neither sweet, nor sour.  The orange beef, Korean BBQ chicken, and singapore street noodles were okay, but again. Extra spicy meant packets of chili sauce.  How can they charge an average of $15 to $18 per plate?  Our horrible meal cost us $80 and unless they do something great to make me give them another chance, I will not be back.  I don't know whether it was the chef or the restaurant, but OMG!  Why discontinue a great curry dish in favor of this food?  Tsk tsk tsk.",

And what a friendly employee you have there . So with temps outside at 120 degrees, but delicious filets, to the spicy Tuna rolls, and Brown rice, and lets not forget our very Cold Kirins in then keepsake glasses,  ive said to much.

Ordered a pear Mojito as well, loved the flavor of the pear however I would have liked to taste a little more mint, I'm guessing the pear masks it pretty well. Dessert was delicious, I love strawberries and cream so the shortcake was right up my alley, strawberries nice and fresh too! For the price of an appetizer, entree, dessert and alcoholic beverage it wasn't bad so I could see myself returning.",

We came in last weekend for an early dinner before a movie, and I left with a bad taste in my mouth. My husband ordered a Woodford reserve on the rocks with a splash of soda water and I ordered a Woodford reserve Manhattan; my husband's glass seemed really full and watered down and I received a very sweet old fashioned. I let our waitress know about the wrong drink order, the harm no foul, but it took awhile to get my correct drink. My entree had good flavor but it was overcooked. The worst part was the bill. Two cocktails, an appetizer and two entrees cost $63 ($75 after tip)?! Each Woodford cocktail cost $10.75, what is this, scottsdale?? I bartend at a bar in Tempe and know this is price gauging.   This will be my last visit to pf Chang's for a long time. There are too many great restaurants in the valley  to throw my hard earned toward mediocracy.",

We finally found parking in a nearby garage and crossed our fingers that we'd get it validated. Good news: PF Chang's had a sign right on their hostess stand saying they validate. Cool!  We were there a bit past 7 p.m. on a weeknight. I was surprised at how empty the place was given the number of people out on the nearby streets and evidence that other, nearby, restaurants looked pretty packed. OK by me, just meant we'd get seated and served quickly.  Service was good and prompt. We tried the salt and pepper prawns for the first - and last - time. The \"pepper\" was red hot chili peppers but that flavor wasn't at all in evidence and I don't have it in me to down a whole chili pepper. The salt was way too intense. The sauce was liquid horseradish. This one just didn't work. The rest of the meal was good.  Happy enough. No reason to stop coming here.",

The staff was happy which really kept the mood up.  If we needed something we didn't need to ask.  When I looked up to find our server someone would make eye contact smile and inform her.  Oh yeah and the food was great, but that's why you go to PF Chang's, because it's delicious. Beef and broccoli, Beef al Sichuan and some chicken and shrimp deal with vegetables were had.  The first two were so good if made the chicken/shrimp dish seem lacking.  Healthy but lacking. I wouldn't expect that kind of service from anyone, so, well done.

Well, they DROWNED the dish with enough salty sauce (maybe 1.5-2 cups) to make it more like a soup than anything else.  Also, It was a struggle to find more than a few shavings on meat in the dish, disappointing.  I'm pretty sensitive to salt in my food because of my blood pressure and my best estimate is that this one dish probably had 5,000mg sodium in it.  Ambience - I appreciate the effort to be helpful, but we were brusquely interupted 9 times during our lunch.  Come on people - if my water glass is empty then discreetly fill it up, don't ask me LOUDLY if I want more water while interupting my conversation. At that point, you're not providing good service, it's just amateurish crap.  Would I go back? If I did, I'd order something very lite on the sauce, but then I'd discover that I'd ordered a meat and veg dish with minimal meat and veg.  So, what's the point coming back?  So PF Changs - BFD that you sponsor a marathon!? - what good is that when you make people sick afterwards with your insanely salty food, eh?",

Well, not the best restaurant experience. It was still wonderful, since I was with his company:) Food was great and our waitress was ok. And they are the reason i'm giving it two stars. Otherwise, i'd be giving it none. Costumer service when we first walked in was HORRIBLE. We totally got ignored by the manager, who's name i believe is johnny, rudely bypassed us and decided to first sit the people behind us. He had clearly seen us. Ugh! So rude! First impressions are so important, and i was already ready to walk out seconds after walking in. But decided to still give this place another try and  waited for the real hostess to seat us, but it was still a challenge since she said we couldn't get our seating of choice, when clearly there was free tables. We had to wait until there was one \"available\" seating of our choice. Upsetting. I had lost my appetite... I think that's why we had to doggy bag most of our food. I've never had such bad experience at any restaurant like here, specially not within my first min of walking in. But, decided to stay and enjoy our dinner, inspite. Food was really good and our waitress was friendly and kept checking up on us. But, we will definitely NOT come here again. Don't expect good service here. Prepare to be ignored. Also utensils had dry gunk on them waitress had to bring replacement, no iced tea refills until we were about to pay our bill. \"Uh, no thanks\" Oh, as we were walking out the same \"manager\" was at hostess station.  We asked for parking validation to hostess; and manager just stared, no words, while the hostess bid us good evening.  Ps. Check your doggy bag before you leave, seemed like not all my left over food was there. And they had to add something that was left out from a separate to go order.  Good luck! :)",

The food was delicious, I ordered the 2 for 40 with my mom; she got the broccoli beef and I had the spicy chicken. The 2 for 40 came with an appetizer, soup, entrees and one sweet treat. We had their veggie spring rolls, my mom had the egg drop soup and I had the hot and spicy or whatever. We were satisfied with all of it. I also ordered a Long Island and omg, BEST LONG ISLAND I'VE EVER HAD. I wish I took a picture of it, because it was pretty too lol our service was great, we had Zach and he was a fantastic server. This place was delicious and would love to go again.",

    "text": "I work in Tempe, and every day I bring my own lunch to work - except Fridays when I get take out from PF Changs. The crispy honey chicken lunch bowl is delicious and the employees are nice. The manager is always walking around with a big smile on his face.   I'm really picky so I modify my lunch bowl to remove the sauce and other parts of the dish and to also skip the soup. So basically I eat chicken and rice and ask for some sauce on the side. Today the manager told me that I can no longer order that because they can't have people \"taking advantage\" of the lunchbowls with modifications. I think this stinks for two reasons - one - they are actually saving with me because I don't take the soup and accoutrements.  Two - I come there almost every week and now..I guess I don't get to anymore unless I order the full size (which is wayyy to much for this belly).   Oh well! La Bocca is delicious and it is right across the street!",

    "text": "Treachery! Seek it out:  Let me begin this review by saying that mine is not an indictment on this particular location but on every single P.F. Chang's I've had the misfortune of being dragged to.  P.F. Chang's is effectively the Cheesecake Factory of bad Chinese food, with the disadvantage of not being as capable of delivering passable food. They bill themselves as a \"gourmet\" Asian experience, which is a bit of a laugh when they turn around and sell you their equally horrible frozen entrees right from the convenience of your local Wal-Mart. Everything is bland, overcooked, and ridiculously priced.   Once you've paid nearly $14 for their \"orange peel chicken\", you may privately hope to yourself that they might have the audacity to include some fried rice. This is your second mistake. Sadly, the bistro calls you on your bullshit. You get white or brown--fried rice is several dollars extra and not at all worth it.  Everything seems to be cooked just wrong--things that shouldn't be are too crispy, things that should be sauced are too dry, things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods, all the while you find there's no way to escape the treachery.  Things get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper: P.F. Changs, while sounding vaguely Asian, is a wholly American creation. It was founded by Paul Fleming (in Scottsdale, actually) with SOMEone with some Asian influence to spice it up a bit, named Philip Chiang. (They literally cut out the poor bastard's \"i\" so that it would \"fit on the signs better,\" or, as I like to believe, not scare away the flyover-states-white-folk so.) It's highly Americanized (and yes, I've had Chinese food in China, but I've also enjoyed great \"American Chinese\" food here) to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of \"wok charred beef\", listed as one of the saltiest foods in America.  The decoration is clumsy and their famous inclusion of terra cotta warriors are literally symbols of death. From Jennifer 8 Lee's Fortune Cookie Chronicles:  'But not everyone finds the terra-cotta warriors charming. \"Chinese people would never put that in a restuarant,\" Jim told me, pointing at the statues. \"It's not lucky. It's something you put at a burial site! But in America, they think it's a Chinese thing.\" From a Chinese perspective, P.F. Changs is decorated with death.'  Which is just fine, because everything there tastes like death anyway.",

    "text": "After another lunch meeting that I didn't quite have the gumption to suggest be moved, I figured it is time to finally review this place.    Once upon a time, I was a poor college student who ate at cheap places, but loved \"gourmet\" food.  P. F. Chang's somehow built a reputation, albeit hardly deserved, of offering high quality \"gourmet\" Chinese food.  So, naturally, I decided that I wanted to try P. F. Chang's.  One evening before I graduated, the team decided to celebrate our impending freedom from Michael Crow's tuitionary grasp by dining at the P.F. Chang's across the street.  I don't recall what I had, but I think it was a Singapore Chow Fun (or something to that effect).  It was...passable I guess, but it cost $15, and wasn't even close to being as good as the Singapore Chow Fun I've had at Chinese take-out places in New York, and it cost over twice as much.  This poor college student could tell right off hand that this place is incredibly overrated (its average 3-star review is still too generous).  Fast forward a few weeks, and I'm in Houston for a job training regime.  The group decides to hit up P.F. Chang's for dinner.  I figured, since the company is reimbursing, I might as well give it another shot.  The appetizers were the best part of my meal, and the rest... well, it was the same drab, flavorless ennui we have all grown to expect from this place.  Then, of course, there was our lunch last week (once again, I didn't pay.  P.F. Chang's now occupies an important spot on my list of places I would never pay to eat at).  I had the honey garlic chicken, which didn't taste honey, garlic, or anything else besides deep fried chunks of chicken dipped in a lame sweet and sour type sauce.  I only ate half of it, which is worth mentioning, if you knew me at all.  And don't get me started on those lettuce wraps.  Those are the most overrated dish in the history of corporate faux-ethnic cuisine.  The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because their less expensive offering, Pei Wei, manages to be EVEN WORSE!  I swear, Pei Wei has only one sauce, whether you buy the Thai or General Tso's.  Do yourself a favor and just stick with your local neighborhood Chinese take-out place.  You'll get better food for a lower price.",

The bar was \"dead\" when I got there on a Wednesday night at 8pm, but the hostess and bartender were both very friendly and helpful.  The drink (a Mai-tai) was very good as well.  The dynamite shrimp appetizer was as expected anywhere else - not disappointed! However, since I was alone, I got the salmon and asparagus dish as I wasn't sharing with anyone.  The first time, the salmon was dry and overcooked.  They immediately apologized, and the manager brought out a fresh dish a few minutes later, cooked correctly, but still very dry and tasting not at all like salmon.  Maybe I'm just used to fresh salmon from the west coast, or really good seafood places (even Albuquerque and Salt Lake City can get fresh salmon).   In any case, I told the manager that I was being picky, and asked if I could have the Chang's Spicy chicken instead - it was excellent!  Their rewards program is very nice, and the dynamite shrimp is free this month to members (I didn't realize that).  Unfortunately, PF Chang's corporate has not seen the wisdom in bringing back the old \"shot-glass\" desserts as I call them. They used to have about (10) different single-serving desserts that were PERFECT for any size table so that everyone could get a few sweet bites after a large meal. They only have regular-sized desserts now, so needless to say, I did not partake after all that food.",

I hadn't been to any PF Chang's location in more than 5 years and after my meal here, I remember why.   A large group of us went out for a colleague's last day. The waiter was efficient and took our orders quickly. He even asked if we wanted separate checks and was very accommodating. No problem there. He was great.  I ordered the lunch size chicken satay with the side salad. Peanut sauce came on the side. The first piece chicken was tender but the peanut sauce was under whelming. I kept dunking just to be sure I had enough sauce on the chicken but it was still lacking in flavor. The second piece of chicken was full of fat and just had a weird texture. I didn't eat it. On to the side salad which should have been fresh and crispy. The menu promoted it as \"fresh\" and it was anything but. It was wilted and not appealing at all.   Lunch with my colleagues is always fun, but I'd like to get my money's worth. PF Chang's was a disappointment. Will likely be another 5 years before I try it again.",

As I paid for my food I asked who answers the phones. I didn't receive a clear answer. I calmly and respectfully said, \"you guys gotta provide better service on the phone.\" He said, \"ok we'll try.\" No \"what happened?\" No \"what can we do better?\" No \"I'm so sorry.\"  I won't be returning to this or any other PF Changs.

Our initial seating and server left us wanting to leave. After I presented my experience to the manager (Kylie), he promptly corrected our issues and provided us with a great server (Alex) who made our night. The food was excellent and we all had a great time. Thank you Kylie and Alex for a great evening.!",

There was a cast of characters behind the bar that stumbled all over themselves attempting to serve people but the result of this totally uncoordinated effort was that none of the guests received good service LOL. We waited over 10 minutes for one of our cocktails and it was not a specialty drink. Soup was ok but not hot. Spring rolls were good lettuce wraps were what you expect. The shrimp fired rice dish was terrible. So I am over PF Chang's. Plenty of local restos to support!!",

Ross was professional, kind, expedient and knowledgeable. He treated me like I was a guest in his own home. How unbelievably refreshing!  Thank you, Ross, for making my visit to P.F. Chang's, so utterly enjoyable!",

    "text": "This is the worst P.F. Chang's location I have ever visited. I live on Mill and have gone to P.F. Chang's once a week for 2+ years.  A new bartender started, I don't know her name. But I typically order a to go order and a drink and smoke a cig on the patio while I'm waiting.  Again, I've been doing this for 2+ years.  And many times there are other patrons on the patio doing the same thing. One day (when the female bartender was working) I placed my order and go outside to do the same as I've always done- and she comes out and says that's not allowed (smoking on the patio).  I'm obviously surprised as I've never had an issue before but I obliged- maybe there's a new rule? I dunno. I come back the next week,the bartenders are like that is not a rule, you are fine.  The next time I'm in there after that, i ask about the smoking policy. A different bartender says there isn't one, you're good.  So I say to him, that's funny because this female bartender a few weeks ago said I was breaking rules/policy.  He said no, that's not True, you are fine.  As I'm having this convo, the female bartender pops up out of no where and gets in my face.  She got crazy- why are saying this about me? Why are you talking bad about me to my coworkers- literally in my face.  I was honestly taken aback by the lack of professionalism and requested  a manager immediately and refused to talk to her.  The manager on duty refunded me and apologized,  I didn't feel comfortable getting food from this location and I never will.  Im disgusted by the unprofessional of this location and the inability of this restaurant to secure a safe environment for its patrons.",

    "text": "Took some people out Pre-valentine's day.  Ordered chicken wraps which were good.  We had a dirty martini which was very well prepared with enough olives.   I ordered my favorite salt and pepper shrimp.  The other dishes were beef with broccoli, pork fried rice and spicy beef.  The broccoli tasted as it was taken out of the frozen broccoli bag and dumped on the plate.  No flavor.  The pork fried rice lacked seasoning and had chunks of pork that were dry and hard to eat.  Why not make the chunks smaller so that it integrates into the rice as the large chunks were almost inedible (they were so dry and hard).  And for $12.95, I expect fried rice to be spectacular---hey folks, it's just rice--I expect you to do a bang up job at this price point.  Most restaurants charge $8 at most.   The spicy beef was tasty but it was overwhelmed with just celery and carrots which my dining companion would not eat. After a few pieces of celery you have had enough and since there was no variety of veggies, he left them.   My salt and pepper shrimp was good but I did notice that the size of the shrimp was not consistent throughout the dish.  At my Scottsdale location, the shrimp are all large--here, some small and some large.    To be polite my companions packed their food and took it home, I hope they didn't dump it as I paid a lot of money for this meal.   I belong to PF Chang's loyalty club because I love their food most of the time.  Today, not so much.",

Because we don't know exactly which dish caused us to get sick, I won't be coming back to this location. We paid over 100 dollars just to get sick.",

    "text": "I hesitated to give this place one star.  I think it is just a sentimental thing.  I used to love this place. However, I must agree with many of the lesser reviews on here.  The food and service at this location have gone south, really south.  I went last night by myself for an early dinner since my spouse was out of town.  I was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar or at a table and I asked for a table, not really in the mood for the bar scene.  They sat me at a little table in the bar right next to the bar/waiter station.  Not a great seat in the place considering there were only three or four other tables occupied in the entire restaurant when I arrived.  Next, I ordered some shrimp dumplings and some Street Noodles.  The dumplings were OK.  They really lacked for some sauce, so I tracked someone down for some hot mustard to add some kick.  This only helped some, so I thought that the lettuce wrap sauce would do the trick, but could never get a hold of anyone to get it for me.  The bartender who took my order became busy with his side-work and with his girlfriend who had happened into the bar.    The street noodles weren't nearly as good as they sounded on the menu.  The noodles were kind of a dry/sticky combination of an odd curry mixture and there were green onions that were literally a whole stock with the ends cut off, then cut in half.  How am I supposed to eat that?  I only had water with lemon to drink.  The bartender gave me a glass with a very little and thin slice of lemon in it (not really meant for more than appearance).  When my glass was empty I had to flag him down for a refill and he summoned a bus boy to fill my water.  He grabbed a pitcher from a nearby ledge and proceeded to fill my glass with room temp water that melted the little ice I had remaining there and looked completely shocked when I requested a separate glass filled with ice.  Lastly, I just have to throw in a side note.  They have stopped preparing any dishes with sea scallops in them.  May seem a little like I am whining, but the kung-pao scallops and orange peel scallops were some of the best dishes I had ever experienced there.  Unfortunately, I think I am going to have to let this place go.  I desperately want for it to go back to the great restaurant with amazing food and even better service that I recall from only a few years ago.",

    "text": "Nope. Nope. Nope.  Hey Yelpers, JP here with an honest to god review about this PF Changs, Tempe.  I called in at about 630pm for some takeout and Emma answered the phone with a horrible unwilling attitude transferred me to another person that could take my order which the first flag came up b/c you'd  think \"its PF Changs, of course, they've got their s&!t together\" and every employee should be conscientious and know the menu that is on the internet it been THEIR OWN WEBPAGE! I said that I was interested in their meal for 4 which again is on their webpage as a take-out option. Would you believe that the girl on the phone had absolutely no idea what I was talking about? and magically to my dismay, the call dropped, or probably I was hung up on.  Naturally, I called again. The same girl answered the phone and I mentioned the item again and then she put me on like a 2 1/2 minute hold.  Afterwards, their manager answered the phone I went through the whole thing again but this time I got the feeling he did not know what I was talking about I was starting to get upset b/c, how hard can it be to know your menu!!!, I literally had to explain what I was seeing on the internet to him like a 5y/o. He was not accommodating at all and did not offer details about stuff I guess he should know out of the top of his mouth him being in a leadership position and all. My wife realized that 15 minutes had passed with this simple ordeal with no headway and completely  scared away any present and future cravings for this place so we hung up b/c if they can't get an order right, why would I want to give them my business.    So this part goes to them bc I know that they read these reviews. =====Get your S^!% together PF Chang, you have 1 job! know your menu, be prepared. which clearly your not! Will go their personally this week to put a face on these idiots voices and personally express my discontent with the way the handle themselves not only on the phone but also profesionally.",

Another amazing dish! Loved the heat from the chili and the crunch from the peanuts. The portion was really good enough for two people. I want to give a special mention to the way the rice was cooked. It was perfect! It had a bite to it but wasn't chalky. Beautifully done! The ambiance is beautiful too!

I called and they told me that they wouldn't deliver and that I had to comeback and pick up what THEY forgot to put in my bag - so I had to ask for a refund for that item.

    "text": "PF Chang's has always been a favorite, but it had been YEARS since I have been back and able to make a dinner reservation. We did so for my birthday. And it was a very pleasant experience!   They were very prompt in seating for a reservation. The service staff was on top of it and knew exactly what I was referencing when it came to my favorite dish that is no longer on the menu (but still served when requested). We really loved the new cocktails including raw, local honey! The mojito w/ cucumber & honey was outstanding. I would absolutely go back just for cocktails because of that gem of a drink!   And when it comes to birthdays, they probably have the best, most unique free dessert! Banana stuffed wantons w/ cinnamon sprinkle & pineapple vanilla ice cream... SO good!!! Plus, they have a really good rewards program you can sign up to join for free.   The only complaint we both had, was the bathrooms. Absolutely gross. That is the only reason I can't rate this a 5. I understand it gets busy on Friday and Saturday nights... but having to wade through toilet paper all over the floor, with \"water\" all over the floors & sink counters along with unflushed toilets was pretty gross and made us pull out our portable hand sanitizer even after washing our hands. Please clean & upkeep the bathrooms!   But,love this chain, and this location had a great staff and good service! Thanks for making my birthday a very enjoyable evening!",

Table put together in 3 minutes. We sat down and a minute later we were ordering drinks. 5 minutes later all the drinks showed up and the order was spot on. Took a bit to decide what to get. Finally we did and our waiter was so helpful in figuring out what some us really wanted. So much food was ordered. All came out hot and in a very reasonable time. Tasted great. Slightly over priced but I think ok for the area one could argue. Well seasoned and full of flavor. Even enough to take some home with us. Best part was the coconut ice cream and banana egg rolls. Delicious. Definitely a place to come back to next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. While the dumplings I got were good, the amount of rage I'm feeling toward tonight's dinner service is immense. I ordered the Mongolian beef expecting to enjoy myself and my meal. I came to PF with a larger group but was one of the first people to order, so when I was the last person sitting at the table without any food I was worried. After 10 minutes of waiting I had to ask the waitress where the heck my food was. After a half-hearted apology and more waiting i was given a small plate of food that could never be considered \"family style\" let alone equate to $17. What's worse is that the plate didn't even come with the rice that the menu said would accompany the meal. The beef tasted alright but the meat was very chewy. I would have been better off going to the campus Pei Wei and getting food there. I'd had paid half the price and the food would've been much tastier.  So between bad service, poor quality of food, and the price, I won't be coming back here voluntarily. (One of the other friend's who was dining with us also had problems, enough so that she had to send her entire meal back and get something else to go.)  Pro - tip: If you want inexpensive Asian cuisine that tastes amazing, check out Mekong Plaza in Mesa. There are tons of amazing restaurants whose prices aren't going to gut you and the food is worth returning for.",

Freezing outside (unnaturally so) for Phoenix, and the door opening every 3 seconds with people sqeezing in/out.  Family wants to stay because of course every other place on any sort of main strip is going to be the same wait.  Finally sit: waiter looks 13 and wet behind the ears, seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown (running frantically, cursing under his breath), stops by after 10 minutes to let us know \"I will help you later, Im busy,\" meanwhile the kids have already eaten at Krispy Creame across the street or else they would be pissing all over the table, no room to even get out of your table except to go all the way to the back of the place since its packed so tight with people.  3 hours later, finishing up, no time or room for desert with mega-sized fried portions, escaping back out in the cold to go home and feel ill.  Is this worth the 300$ bill?  Is this what we call entertainment and family time?  At least the orange peel chicken was excellent, but after starving that long anything would taste like fried manna.",

    "text": "I must be the only person in Phx never to eat here. Ok, so we did finally go before Phantom. Mixed reviews here.I love Peiwei so assumed I would love this place too.I did not.  I am at a crossroad as to give it a good review or a bad so I  will just say what happened noting what I liked an disliked about the experience.  We got here at around 4:45 which was good because by the time we left the place had a long wait and was packed. The first thing I did not like is the way it is set up. Tables all over the place with no spaces to walk in between. It was very odd. I found this very annoying and I am sure a nightmare for older or handicapped people. It seemed very weird for me to be banging into people's elbows as I walked by their tables. The service was very good at the start but died when they got busy. Although the manager here was great, printing out nutritional value menu for me and another waitress walked me to the bathroom. Our server was ok, seemed a little ditzy but was ok, not great just, OK. I ordered a wedge salad with chicken and got a wedge salad with no chicken. I ate it all before I realized it. (I know don't ask. I guess I was starving and the blood drained from my brain) I did not want the waitress to think I was trying to scam her. I pointed it out and said it was Ok since I did not point it out sooner and after all I did eat it all but just an FYI for the cook. She did not seem very concerned and I think this is a huge mistake for a place to make. They did not comp the bill the difference which I think they should have even though I said it was ok.( The salad was good but there was a three dollar difference in price) I worked in the restaurant business for years and comping the difference would  have been the very  least I would have done. I also thought that was a huge mistake on the part of the cook and server in an expensive place such as this. . Of course, I do take partial responsibility for not noticing it until it was to late and the food was good. The dressings make it. I had these awesome cucumbers too that tasted nice.  Again, it is their sauce. My friend had a noodle dish that was very tasty too. The service took along time to get the food to us though and the place was horribly noisy. Yikes! Two large parties sandwiched around us. One where children kept clinking knives on the glasses non stop and the other table had people clapping every minute about something or another. This was horrid! I like a quieter dining experience please.The last straw was when a couple with 2 very naughty kids sat down in back of us and I got wacked in the back of the head with the kid's paper that he kept flinging around and hitting his father with.A father that did not do one thing to discipline the kid.  Please if you are bringing out the kids leave if they are misbehaving. All in all the experience was not horrible but not great either. I might go back for lunch and try some more of their dishes. However, to be honest there are other good restaurants in town that are better suited to me. Since I love Peiwei i will eat there more often and skip this much pricier option.",

I arrived 3 mins after it was suppose to be ready. The nice bartender was packaging it up. I got pepper steak with brown rice and egg drop soup. When I checked my bag - all that was in there was the pepper steak entree. I asked the bartender for the egg drop soup. While he went to get the soup, I decided to check my bag to ensure I received the right entree. I'm glad I did, because there was NO rice in there - just the plain pepper steak entree!!! So when the bartender came back with the egg drop soup, I had to ask him for the brown rice!! Truly frustrating and a pain. Especially since I placed the order online 30 mins prior.  As if the experience itself weren't bad enough - when I get back to work (which is literally 2 mins away), the food was cold. The pepper steak was ice cold like it had been sitting there for hours or made a long time ago.  Very disappointing - I will not be returning to this PF Chang's or any other one for a long, long time.",

Just varying degrees of high fructose corn syrup and modified corn starch. I usually stick to vegetable dishes to avoid the meats that seem boiled, overly soft and bland. No texture or flavor except sugar and salt. The vegetables taste precooked and reheated since they never have any crunch. They are soft too so there is no texture to the meal. The soups like the hot & sour are so thick and gelatinous that they are more like dipping sauces. Tasted like the same sauce thats on the food, but more like a thick jello version. There is no redeeming value here. I have asked them before to not make the sauce so sweet and they said it wasn't possible because they're all pre-made. So weird since it IS expensive, it would make the most sense to stir fry the meals fresh and their problem would be pretty much solved. But, I think they're in the business of making money, not food.",

We have 32 people 12 of which are picking child eaters that eat like birds and we STILL ran out of food!! The pans were in many cases not even half full!! This is the 12th catering order I've placed in two weeks and Pf Chang's is the only one this has happened with and yet, I paid the most for.

    "text": "Ive eaten at PF Changs many times at the East Mesa location and always had a great meal.  On 5-5-19 my family and I stopped in at the Tempe location for lunch.  Everything started out just fine, and we were really looking forward to some lettuce wraps.  When the waiter shows up at the table with the main course, I ask, \"So I guess the appetizer isn't coming?\"  He replies, \"Did you order one?\" \"Yeah.... the kitchen didnt get that done I guess.\"  It was obviously too late at this point, so i just told him to forget it.      The main course tasted on par with any 2.5 star chinese take out joint.  The quality was not  what I was used to from the location in Mesa.  Then just to top it off, once the waiter realized I was less than thrilled with things there, he decided the best course of action was to ignore our table.  Couldnt get drinks refilled, and after a long wait I had to result to waving my arms at him just to get his attention long enough so we could get the check so we could leave.       The biggest mistake I made was not checking the bill.  $76 for 2 chicken dishes, 1 beef dish, and some fried rice?  Thinking back on it, I likely paid for the appetizer i never got.  Honestly I just wanted to leave, and didnt think to make sure I wasnt being ripped off.       Incredibly disappointing experience.  If I wanted low quality food and service, I would have gone somewhere cheaper.  I will not be going back.",

I ordered from here the other night and I got the Honey Chicken which, I'd never had before but sounded very good. Wrong! It taste like alcohol somehow and then was spicy, which this isn't marked to have either. So that was a major let down. But then I ordered sides of fried rice and lo mein, end though they switched up the protein, they were delicious. So when Saturday came around, I was craving it again! So I ordered two sides of fried rice and two of lo mein. Holy crap they're lucky I wasn't in-house dining because I would have caused a scene! ALL of my food was burnt. All of it! Both rices, both noodles. I couldn't get past the char burnt taste. I tried but I couldn't. They also forgot the won tons I ordered. One of the noodles had ONE piece of meat, that then was burnt (see photo to get an idea). I fought to get my money back from DoorDash but, this was a joke! I don't care if it was a busy Saturday night, don't care if it was delivery, the quality should always be the same. I used to get P.F. Chang's ALL the time and now every time is a let down. I don't think I'll ever have interest in going again, and definitely not if it's this location! STAY AWAY!",

Still had to pay a couple dollars because I guess we stayed longer than what they cover.   Our server was a super friendly, younger gentleman - maybe a college student? He did a great job with our party of 7 and was knowledgeable, attentive and kind throughout our dining experience. Made sure we got to take advantage of their happy hour specials. All our main entrees came out together and everyone was pleased with their dishes.   Since this is a chain restaurant, you pretty much know what to expect in terms of the menu. What can vary from location to location is the service and ours was great this visit! Would definitely return.",

I know that it's a chain, and I know that it is not even remotely authentically Chinese.  (I lived in China, so don't even get me started on what Americans try to pass off as Chinese food...)  HOWEVER, I am all about the lost art of service in the service industry; and I am here to tell you that, as long as Gideon is running this PF Chang's, I will be coming here to eat!  The food is good-- you know it is!  The firecracker shrimp-- yum!  Spicy eggplant and garlic green beans  and the tofu lettuce wraps kept the vegetarians in the group happy.  We mostly just ordered lots of apps for sharing, enjoyed some drinks and bemoaned the fact that PF Chang's no longer sponsors the Phoenix Rock 'n Roll half marathon... so Gideon, who was just coming by to check on us, agreed that running races and seeing friends after too long apart deserved celebrating-- and he not only gave us the discount we used to get with our race bibs, but he even honored my expired coupons because I have now moved to northern New England where the nearest PF Chang's is three hours away!  I tell you: this kind of manager is too rare in today's world!  My sister is the local, though-- and you know that she'll be back!  As will I every time I come for a visit!  Next round is on me, Gideon!  You know how to do things right!  Cheers!",

As soon as I finished one another was on the way. They were very friendly as well. They accommodated me in every way possible, sometimes i'm a lil difficult so i commend them.

Every single place out here that I have tried (other than PF Changs) uses low quality meat, large amounts of MSG, and overall is disappointing in every aspect. This is why I go to PF Changs.  I come from Philadelphia, which has a pretty large Chinatown. When I first learned of the Chinese situation here, a tear rolled down my cheek. Chinese food is a staple to my existence (as someone who is Jewish, my Christmas's would be lost without it!). I try my hardest to allow PF Changs fill this void while I am here.  While I admire the service and the atmosphere, and some dishes are alright, it just doesn't do it for me. The portions are very tiny, the prices are high, and I hate the commercialization.   My personal recommendation is to get the Chicken Chow Fun. For the price, this is the largest thing on the menu. This is a dish of wide egg noodles with large white meat cuts of chicken.  Here is a picture for reference (though this is Beef Chow Fun):  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjadecafe2565.com%2Fyahoo_site_admin%2Fassets%2Fimages%2FBeef_Chow_Ho_Fun-3.29102408_std.JPG&s=85a868b4892497eadf80efd0fcde09aebd6208e591722d6b1cac10218d815df0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">jadecafe2565.com/yahoo_s...</a>  Sometimes this comes with the noodles undercooked. Sometimes this comes drowning in sauce. Though most of the time it comes just right.  I grew to love this dish after my time over there. It is a staple street food that I could get for 5 RMB at the most (around 70 cents). Nothing PF Changs can come up with even touches the lowest tier of Chinese cuisine over there.  PF Changs and myself were in a marriage of convenience. Once I leave Arizona, I don't see myself ever setting foot in one ever again.",

    "text": "One of the worst restaurant experiences I had in a while. The service was incredibly slow. Our first dish was the chicken lettuce wraps. The white noodle crisps that come with the chicken lettuce wraps were so hard and burnt, and when my mom ate some of them in her wrap, she chipped her tooth! We politely told our waitress about it, and she just LAUGHED and walked away. No apology, no \"I'll talk to the cook about that.\" It's like that was her plan all along , and she was so happy that customers were receiving bodily harm from the food. The rest of the food took forever to arrive, to the point where we eventually had to find SOMEONE that passed by to ask what was going on. The sea bass that arrived was the worst cooked fish we've ever tasted. It tasted old, rough, and the spinach it came with was the worst spinach ever (the sauce tasted like a cigarette,  the spinach was raw, and parts of it had giant amounts of salt piled on!). I mean, how do you screw up spinach? I've tasted this same dish at the P.F. Chang's at King of Prussia in Pennsylvania, and it tastes so much better and so completely different. Our mongolian beef dish here was very rough and again had an overwhelming amount of burnt white noodle crisps. The only dish that was semi-edible was the beef lo mein, and even that had a lot of salt. Our waitress eventually came over to ask how we were liking the food, and we hesitated. We could kind of predict that she would just laugh and walk away. But she kept standing there, so we eventually told her the spinach was too salty and under cooked. And guess what - she laughed and walked away. Again.  Awful service, awful food.",

So I got wonton soup (for the throat), the BF got sweet and sour chicken and we shared some dumplings. The soup was so bland.... possibly the most bland wonton soup I have ever tried. The BF thought the sweet and sour chicken was alright.... but the menu says it is pan fried and the chicken is clearly deep fried... yuck. Also, They really don't give you a very large portion for what you pay.... most places I can eat the food for at least two days on what they give you, but the BF finished all maybe 10 pieces of chicken that were on his dish.  I would never pay to eat at this restaurant. Their food is so ridiculously bad for you and expensive. Their double pan fried noodles have just about a full day's worth of sodium and calories... ugh. I do not understand how the PF Changs all stay in business.... they're just not good. I had better chinese food yesterday and the entrees cost 5$....",

    "text": "I am not a fan of P.F. Chang's because it is a mega chain. I do, or I used to, like some of their dishes but now that I am a veggie/celiac I am no longer a fan.   Although P.F. Chang's has a gluten-free menu which is very helpful if you eat meat the option for a vegetarian is the Buddha's Feast which is a bowl of bland steamed veggies. Blah - you don't even get the option of any tofu or any spices or herbs...  And although normally I am willing to give 3 stars to a place that at least tries to accommodate a variety of diets, this particular P.F. Chang's gets a 2 star due to the terrible delivery of food. My full order of garlic snap peas (which is really quite good) came out as a half order. I had to ask whether it was a half and finally they sent out another half. Good thing I caught it otherwise we would have paid for the full. Then when I ordered the Buddha's Feast, I was asked if I wanted it stir fried to add some flavor and I said sure - that sounds great! But, when I received my dish, it was a bowl of steamed veggies (and not even fresh looking). When I inquired what happened to my stir fried version, another server explained something about a matrix and that the kitchen would have to do some stuff and yadda yadda. Well, in the end, I had to eat these boring, bland and flavorless steamed veggies.  I was also promised the gluten-free soy sauce which only came after I asked for it twice.  I gave P.F. Chang's a 2 star rating because the rest of my group enjoyed their meal for the most part. The beef and broccoli was so salty they couldn't eat it. The chow fun, the sweet n sour shrimp and the chicken lettuce wraps are what allowed me to give a 2 star rating.  Please make the mushroom lettuce wraps gluten-free and then I will be a fan of P.F. Chang's - buddha's feast just doesn't cut it.",

Great dish with marinated white chicken and rice sticks and an array of sauces. Saved 8 bucks on that order. We ate at the bar on New Years day and luckily the lunch specials stretch out to 4pm every day. One order was shrimp potstickers with whole pieces of shrimp inside. They don't let you order the Dim sum special pan-fried, so steamed is your only choice. Crispier is always better. My dish was Ginger chicken with broccoli, but this was chang's upscale style and I found cherry tomatoes and red onions along with a subtle ginger, garlic sauce. The fried rice on the side was a buck extra and probably not worth it, but the hot and sour soup was one of the better versions i have had over the years. Brittany at the bar was very nice and helpful as the bar got crowded close to her shift end and she even made sure to figure out what was the delay in our mains without me having to ask. Things got resolved and this was a great lunch to start the new year.",

As a matter of fact authentic Chinese food is really not all it's cracked up to be. this is a great place to go with friends or right before the move. I love the steamed pork dumplings with lettuce wraps and c'mon now the Mongolian been is the ish! If people give this place a bad review because it's a chain then that's just silly. Everyone already knows it's a chain and frankly Changs must be doing something right to be as big as they are.  There are time s I get \"Chang-ed out\" but I will always end up back there for some yummy spring rolls!  I did choose to review this spot because it is my favorite I love the atmosphere in here and because it's in Tempe it's a younger crowd and laid back so I do prefer this location to others I have been to in my short time in AZ.",

Food and service has always been as expected with this comfortable chain.  My favorite entrees are the garlic eggplant and the kung pao chicken.  On one occasion, the steamed dumplings that we ordered during dim sum happy hour were delivered cold.  Upon further inspection, they didn't appear to have been cooked.  The server quickly took them away and brought new ones, and the manager stopped by to tell us that they'd been comped.  During a busy period at the restaurant, it's easy for this to happen (particularly with steamed, which look about the same when cooked as when not cooked), so I appreciated that they handled the situation expeditiously and graciously.   This location has great windows that look on to the main street.  They do have a patio, but either the street is too busy or the heat is too intense for it to be pleasant, so we always stick to eating indoors. There's parking in the deck nearby (they validate) or on the street if you're lucky enough to snag a spot.    #Yelp365 - 195/365",

    "text": "The Tempe PF Chang's has always been known for poor food. We've eaten at many other locations in both CA and AZ. We have compared the various dishes and the service at other locations, and last night confirmed our worst fears about this location. Let's be clear, I'm only reviewing the Tempe location. Our waiter seemed odd from the beginning. We were seated in a very empty restaurant. Maybe 10 guests in the whole place. Yet our waiter didn't introduce himself, or ask for our drink order. Instead giving us a quick hello, and telling us he'll be back later for our drinks. After ordering drinks, our server returned 6-8 minutes later saying the \"bar is slammed, and please be patient.\" Note: The restaurant and bar were fairly empty, and we only ordered 3 beers and a wine. Our server finally took our appetizer order. We ordered lettuce wraps. Having ordered this over a dozen times, I know the look and taste. The white gelatin noodles weren't fully cooked and hard, and server didn't ask to mix the sauce to our preference. BUT when a bug crawled out from the lettuce we almost screamed. It was crawling around while a tried to flag down a waiter (or anyone) to witness the bug. Another waiter came over, and saw the bug and whisked the dish away. When our server finally appeared, we told him of the bug. He replied, \"Was the bug big or small?\" Hug??? We decided enough is enough. When the bill arrived, the lettuce wraps were still on our check. We questioned this, and our weird waiter said he wasn't authorized to remove the cost. \"Well, find the manager then!\" The bug infested appetizer was eventually taken off our bill, but the manager never stopped by to smooth things over. There's plenty of great dining options in Tempe, so don't eat here.",

    "text": "When you want to park for this restaurant you have to use the parking garage on Ash but as long as there isn't an event you can get parking validated.   As soon as we walked in I hated our hostess, she was not polite at all asked us if we wanted indoor or outdoor seating, it was a nice day so we chose outside and she sat us, we didn't run into her until later...  As far as our waitress goes (the blonde from Michigan) she was nice.   It was lunch, so our meals were under $10 dollars, that's cool I guess. I ordered the Vegetarian Fried Rice with a salad. The dressing was good, and the meal was good as well, I always add sweet & sour sauce to my rice and this was all fine and dandy.   The downfall to sitting outside is the restaurant sits on two very busy crossroads. Mill Ave and University. So enjoying the outside isn't as much fun with all the hooligans walking around and all the cars honking (because people in Arizona don't know how to drive)  I thought we were gonna leave on a good notice, but that's not how it ended. The hostess that I was telling you about in the beginning, just let's call her skin tight mini skirt girl, was the one giving us our validated card and when I asked a simple question just to make sure I would be doing it correctly, and he response made me feel like I was a dumb ass. \"Ummm no, you stick that in the machine.\" Anyone who is gonna start a response as an \"Um\" is completely unprofessional. She then started dancing around for one of her co-workers about how she was \"off work\". This girl was no doubt a party college girl who only cared about getting one night stands with bro dudes.   At the end of the day I'm really disappointed that as a company they are hiring girls like that to represent them.",

    "text": "I really love PF Changs!  And no, I don't think its really authentic and that is not even a reason why I love this place! So without further ado, my four favorite dishes.  First: PF Changs, has the BEST chicken noodle soup EVER. Forget the egg drop, forget the hot and sour, try this delicious soup! It's a lemony, spicy-ish, chicken broth with cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, pieces of chicken, cilantro, and these weird looking noodles. It might not sound good but TRUST ME it is.  Second:  the fried green beans...YUMMY! Super crunchy and delicious and the dipping sauce is phenomenal!  Third: shrimp and candied walnuts. OK, I never thought I would like a dish with melon balls in it [unless it was like a fruit bowl] but this has definitely changed my mind! Basically, battered and fried shrimp with this creamy sauce with candied walnuts and melon balls. I can't convince you it's good with any of my words, you just need to try it lol  Fourth: Dalhi Chicken. It's super spicy [spiciest dish] with sliced potatoes. If you don't like spicy, DON'T GET THIS. Try the chang's spicy chicken instead... [which is not spicy to me] lol  YOU'RE WELCOME. ;]",

I did like that our drinks were refilled without notice and that we only had to wave him down to ask for the menu again, ordered to go. Our waiter Alex did an amazing job, very friendly and upbeat about his job. The food was very delicious, we finished more of the food but still ended up taking left overs. Always a great experience at this location.",

I get back there after driving another 15 minutes back to this location and the girl apologizes and I have to wait for my order as I told the girl on the phone prior to me coming back that I do not want my food to be cold so they remade it which I appreciate but come on put a priority on this as I already was given the wrong food when I got there initially .  What really irritates me is that I had to ask for part of my bill to be taken care of because the girl gave me the wrong bag when I 1st got there. I guess I learned my lesson too never trust someone knows how to give you the right bag before leaving.",

    "text": "Holy slow as hell!   My mother in law and I had tickets to go see Wicked this past Sunday. We parked and then walked down to PF Changs, we got there at about 445. They were already slam packed. We were quoted a 30 minute wait time but I think we only waited 15 minutes, score!   Once we go to the table, we waited and waited to be acknowledged. Once we were we waited again for another 10 minutes just for our drinks. We ordered an app and it came out fairly quick. However after they cleared the app plate away we waited at least another 20 minutes for our food. As we were getting our food people were quickly clearing out to go to gammage. We had to eat pretty fast. We got to gammage just as they were making the announcement to be seated.   Moral of the story, we got to Changs an hour and 45 minutes before the show started, so if you plan to go here before hand, maybe get there 2.5 hours before hand as the service is sloooooow.   Food was great!",

We have come for their happy hour special which starts at 3pm..and that's great because our work group gets out at 3pm.  So, it's a nice option within downtown Tempe that it starts early.  Not too many places start at 3pm.  All in all this location does everything to give great service, especially if they know your work within the area.",

    "text": "I would like to start by saying I love P F Changs, so much in fact that I ate at this location twice while in Tempe for a five day stay.   Day 1 (Five star review) Two days before valentines day. The server, Jennifer, was excellent she didn't miss a thing. Drinks were always full, good recommendation from the menu, and overall good personality. I had changs spare ribs to start and shaking beef for dinner. It was great, no complaints. everything came out as you would hope when going out to a restaurant.  Day 2 (1 star review) The day after valentines day. We went in looking to sit in Jennifer's section, but she wasn't there. The server we got instead took our appetizer order and suggested the hunan hot fish as my main entree. I had never had the hot fish and was excited to try it out. After waiting about 10 minutes our appetizer, came out. The appetizer was the spare ribs, they usually come with a salty cinnamon mix that you put on the ribs. this time it was like someone forgot the salt and it was almost all cinnamon. not bad, just not as good as usual. After waiting another few minutes we asked our server what was delaying the entrees. He went to check and the manager came out to advise they were out of the fish.   I can't imagine how embarrassing it would be to recommend a dish only to find out the kitchen had ran out. Part of the mangers job is to make sure the wait staff is equipped with that type of information.  Anyway, I ordered a different dish and it came out pretty quick, but they forgot about the spicy green beans we had ordered. On top of that, in the confusion of getting the fish thing sorted out, our drinks had run dry.   The two upsides to the meal is that everything came out tasting good and the manager gave us the green beans for free.",

That being said I still eat here about once a month because it is the closest restaurant within walking distance to my work.   This is the 3rd time I have ordered online and every time the order is incorrect. Today for example, I ordered the double pan fried noodles with shrimp, ONLY SHRIMP, what I received was beef, chicken and shrimp. I walk to Chang's and back to work so walking all the way back to complain is a major inconvenience.  3rd time is the charm. I won't be back. _________________________________________________________ Update to original review. I called and let the manager know what happened and he not only offered to make me a new dish immediately, but he had someone run it over to my work.

So your child can eat for between $2.95 and $4.95, including a drink.  The happy hour is decent.  I had a coconut lemon drop (YUM) for $6, hubby had a large sake for $4.  Plus I shared the edamamme and tofu potstickers with my girls.  There are three small ones for $3.25 but they are GOOD.  One child had the lo mein with tofu, one had buhdda's feast with tofu.  The buhdda's feast was just steamed carrot, broccoli and sugar snap peas.  The rice and sauce (she got sweet & sour) was on the side.  My birthday boy ordered off the gluten free menu and had the mongolian beef.  He scarfed it down.  Hubby had gluten free spicy chicken.  It wasn't hot enough for him so he added more pepper sauce but he did enjoy it.  I had the vegetarian spicy eggplant.  It was DELICIOUS.  $7.95 and I couldn't even finish it.  For my son's birthday they brought him a free mini dessert.  He chose triple chocolate mousse.  Usually they are $2.25 each.  Total bill was $70.",

The broccoli chicken dish was in a bucket of sauce and it was \"bland\" with hardly any broccoli. The eggplant dish was like eating soggy bread in a bucket of sauce. Both dishes had more sauce than food and not spicy at all. I guess they ignore the online instructions. I will never go to this PF CHANGS again.

    "text": "Literally...the worst dining experience of my life. So much went wrong (I will TRY to keep it short).  I made a reservation for 8pm, 8 people on a Saturday. I called at 5pm, giving ample notice. Walk in at 7:58 (2 minutes early) and the table isn't ready. No bother, we wait outside, chit chat but happen to notice a very sparsely occupied patio, which we could have sat at. 20 minutes later. No table. Finally at 8:40 we sit down. What use are reservations? But this isn't the worst part...  We sit and wait for another 10 minutes and are approached by a frantic server: Can I get you drinks? Sure. We order an excess. (You're about to get tipped well if you can make this happen tonight).  Waiting on the drinks...my throat is getting parched...where are the drinks? We get them another 20 minutes later (It's already 9pm folks...an hour after I was supposed to have my table). Here comes Mr. Frantic again - Brings 2 drinks...we're missing some.  He apologizes and confesses he forgot to ring in the other.. Ya kidding me? Finally drops it off. Cool...   But the fun doesn't stop there. My friend orders an appetizer. Expresses she wants THIS to be her entree...to be brought out with everyone else's. It does not happen. He just stares at the table, his mouth agape. Say something. Fix this. Send the Manager over. Do something.  Next up? I don't eat meat...I am served meat. Cool. Frantic Server Dude is now blaming someone else for this transgression and has the Manager come over to drop off my meager  portion of food. The MANAGER says nothing. Not \"Sorry, not how are you this evening? Apologies n such.\" Just drops it off, and forces a smile. What are we doing wrong here as patrons? Am I on freaking Candid Camera?! (what happened to that show anyway...)  Ugh...At this point we all just want to shovel food down our throats and get the hell out. We do the 2 for $40 deal. Where's the dessert we ordered? Blame the Cooks Magoo has his back turned to our table, and is chatting away with his friends. This is not a joke. We sit...and sit...and sit...Ya think he would have turned around at some point to, I don't know: Check on his customers who are going to be tipping him.  Finally my friend taps him on the shoulder and asks if he can box up the dessert so we can just take it with us.  I open my leftovers today and not everything's in there. I hate this place. Hate. Slow...yet the servers run around like chickens with their heads cut off. The food isn't great, that's IF they can get your order right in the first place. It's pointless getting a reservation. OH and IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY.  They knew this! Their home office should really make a secret shop and see what's happening at the Mill Ave location.  Ya suck.  Don't eat here. I know it's Mill...but save yourself the 2 hour shit show I experienced.",

Don't bother making a reservation, they don't honor the system. The food is ok, but the experience? There are SO many better places in Tempe. Give this one a miss.",

I had a brief flashback to my time spent hosting, and I felt as if our roles had been reversed.  But, I digress. Our server, Taylor, was very sweet and helpful with explaining our sauces, and even checked with the cooks to see if I could get spring rolls without the duck (which, sadly was not possible). Their vegetarian options were decent and clearly labeled. Food was good. Ginger beer tasted like bar sweet and sour mix.  I might come back.",

I came here with my boyfriend for a date night and we ordered the honey shrimp, spicy chicken, fried rice, and egg rolls. Everything tasted great, I really just wish the portions were bigger.   Our server was Matthew and he did a great job. Was on top of our drink refills, kind, etc.   Will definitely be coming back often.",

I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and they were delicious as always. Service was great, but I'm always disappointed when waiters try to pick up a plate as I'm still savoring my last few bites!!! I find this to be very rude and it reflects poor customer service training. I understand that table need to be turned over, but rushing customers off is a big no-no in my book.",

Then she assigns us the worst waiter I've ever had ... really ... EVER!  Then the food comes, and we know from experiencing it before,  that something was missing.  So we called the manager.  Our waters completely empty and she seems annoyed that we were complaining but NOT surprised it was \"David\".  She did not apologize or offer anything except a bad attitude.   BEWARE OF THE NEW MANAGEMENT AT THIS LOCATION.",

Paul Flemming had a good idea back in the early 90s and its come to be what to expect in mid-level Chinese...but as with most restaurants there is a level of obsolescence that has touched this chain.  Its still a great go-to for meeting up but there are a lot better options out there.",

    "text": "Cheapskate bartender tried to rip us off on a busy Saturday night, hoping we wouldn't see that he had overcharged us on our bill! Thankfully we did catch the \"error\"  and pointed it out to him. And guess what, the dude wasn't surprised at all. Didn't even pause a moment to check what we were telling him. Just mumbled some excuse and said \"OK, I'll get the manager to fix it.\"   The food was strictly average. We ordered shrimp in lobster sauce and Chang's spicy chicken. Both orders came with a side of rice. We had lettuce wraps for appetizers, and though a lot of reviewers have commented on the lack of their authenticity, I liked them. A party of 20 or so near our table was celebrating some sort of farewell, and their laughter and talk made conversation impossible. Service was extremely slow, which I will put down to the Saturday night traffic. All in all, an average overpriced experience.",

From crab puffs, calamari, lettuce wraps all their starters hit the spot! Never have any complaints with anything i have ordered..and if you're a picky eater you are bound to find something since the menu is large. Shrimp with candid walnuts is prob my fave!   Service is pretty good at this location..it is right by  ASU so it can be hit or miss on being really busy or not..   p.s Reverse happy hour is ONLY at the bar, they have some things that are not on the regular menu that you can only order if you sit at the bar",

I guess I should have thought to ask if we should push 2 tables together because with all the condiments and stuff on the table I only get like 4 inches of the corner. The waiter announces how excited HE is because we're his last table. So his focus was on him I guess. It was a crummy experience and I'm sad about the decor and layout change. Next time I'll walk the restaurant and find a better roomier table or sit at the bar. Eating at the bar would have been more room.",
