Had the classic just to taste a basic no real frills (I.e. extraneous flavors) burger.  Burger was flavorful and the cheese was a little too much, but that's just me.   Bun was pretty good but did have some bun-failure toward the end of mowing down the burg..   Nice presentation of burger and frys (I.e. not in cheap plastic trays) in wire serving trays.   Con's: dagnabit, the frys were nothing special.  I had the \"fancy\" frys (tossed in rosemary and olive oil), no big deal, actually disappointing.    I enjoyed the meal and will be back when I have a craving for cow.   Still have to give Lobby's a second chance (first round goes to Smashburger....no hype on special sauce, good burger - a draw between the two... But like the decor and presentation on SB...",

    "text": "We finally stopped at Smashburger this evening. I'd heard a lot of good things about the place and was looking forward to it.  The food was good. The burger reminded me of Steak and Shake back in Indiana, or maybe the old Wendys of the late 1970's. The onion ring things were good, with the same sort of yummy sauce you get with the Bloomin' Onion at Outback Steakhouse. The other people with me had the fries, which were also good--garlic on them, I think.   The atmosphere was a step up from a typical fast food place, but only a step. The prices were, I thought, really high for what you get. That is the reason for three stars instead of four. I would expect more for the money--better yet, knock 50 cents to $1 off of each item. That would be a winner.  All in all, it was okay. Everything good, nothing great, and almost as expensive as a full service restaurant.",

Our hosts, Kurt and Christina, whom I'd met previously, at the SmashBurger location on Cambelback, were again amazing. Very attentive to everyone's needs. Quick to pass you a sample of their DELICIOUS shakes, or a cup for some soda while waiting in line.  Tonight I opted for the BBQ Bacon Cheddar Smashburger, with an added fried egg, and chipotle sauce and mayo. I also added some Cholula, because it's so damn good!  We also had an order of their fantastic haystack onions, and an order of their signature Smashfries, which I described in my other review; \"The smashfries are pure goodness! Tossed with garlic oil, rosemary, garlic, and other herbs, they were fantastic!\"  Sadly, they were out of their veggie frittes, which was sad, but understandable, given the popularity of the free food event. :D  I have been really wanting to get back to SmashBurger since the previous @PHXTasteCasting event, but life and finances have prevented me. I was OVERjoyed at getting the VIP invite!  Thanks again, Kurt and Christina!!!  P.S. I did not see, and did not inquire about, any beer or wine. I know it is available at the Camelback location. Perhaps they are awaiting a license?  P.P.S.

The burgers are great, sweet potato fries & fried pickles are amazing, and they are one of very few fast food places that offer alcoholic beverages. The line moves quickly but seating is limited so be prepared to take your meal to go. Prices are a bit high, and there can sometimes be a wait to get your food which increases the risk of items not being as fresh or even arriving cold. Overall, worth going back again & again.",

I'm a huge advocate for this stuff, I've tried almost their entire menu with only a few quarrels. everything is reasonably priced, you're looking to drop about 10ish dollars a person for burger, fries, and a drink.  The only small issues I have is that when ever I get the BBQ Ranch chicken sandwich its normally drowning in sauce making it hard to eat. Also making the bread some what soggy, of course you could prolly just order light sauce and fix the problem, I normally am rushed and forget until I get back to my desk  X0   Also as incredible as their burgers are certain ones can get a bit greasy (especially my favorite the Sin City Burger) so if your not used to eating greasy foods which I'm actually not, it can do a number on your stomach. So if your a first timer just start with The 1/3 Pounder Smashburger with smash sauce, and your choice of toppings. Pick a fry, all are good, none are anything to freak out about but there all tasty.  Also plus sides normally pretty quick wait time about 5 maybe 10 min. Service is friendly and helpful, and you can buy beer and they have some pretty good brands there. I feel this is a Win, Win, Win type situation.",

    "text": "Yes, I like Smashburger.  It is not the best hamburger I've ever had. It is not the fastest hamburger place you'll go to. It is not trendy and fancy.  What it is, is a great sort of fast-casual (read: slower than McDonalds, faster than a sit-down restaurant) restaurant.    The burgers are high quality for a casual dining restaurant.  They have a few different varieties of burgers, all coming in either 1/3lb or 1/2lb versions.  You can also build your own using any combination of their available toppings.    Highlight of the entire meal for me :  Adding a fried egg on top of my burger.  My wife makes fun of me for it, but toss a fried egg on a burger, and I'm in heaven.  This place tosses a perfectly fried egg ontop of a delicious burger...fantastic.  The fries are quite tasty as well.  Our super-friendly cashier informed us that the fries are actually McDonalds' old french fry recipe, before they switched to canola oil, etc.  She says Smashburger bought the recipe/etc and now use it as their own.  Who knows if that's True, but it sure did taste True.  Delicious, crispy, salty...amazing.  Just like McD's used to make - you know, before they took out the trans fats, etc.  Maybe they aren't health food...but as a time-to-time indulgence, not so terrible.  They offer regular varieties with sea salt, or they have \"SmashFries\" with olive oil, rosemary, etc.  They also have Sweet Potato fries...  Hard to choose just one, as they are each great for their own reasons.  Honestly, I think the regular salted fries are my favorite, but not by much.  We tried the Smashchicken crispy too - not bad!  Hard to order chicken at a place that does such good burgers, but it was quite tasty.  Not the highest quality cut of bird, but it was white meat and tender and pretty darn good.    Finally...the milkshakes.  Nothing earth-shattering, but definitely quality.  The chocolate was smooth without being overpowering.  They also have a \"cactus vanilla\" which is a blend of vanilla and prickly pear.  I loved it.  Subtle prickly pear flavor with a good strong vanilla.  I really enjoyed it.  The prices aren't fast food low.  Between 2 of us, we were easily over $20...but we didn't exactly skimp on anything either.  2 burgers, 2 fries, 2 milkshakes.    We'll definitely return, and I suggest you give it a shot as well.",

    "text": "My wife and I were invited to the pre-grand opening thing here last night.  It was pretty much like I expected; free food, pretty busy, etc., etc.  The actual location is very nice, very new and very clean so no complaints there.  Their entire staff from the people running the event to the managers to the cashier were all very fast, friendly and helpful.  I didn't really know what to make of this place.  Is it fast food?  Is it a nice, sit-down type of place?  I think it is a small, more \"upscale\", \"boutiquey\" Fudruckers.  I'm not saying that is a bad thing.  Just saying that is what I thought of the place.    Anyway, about the food:  * Smashwedge Salad - my wife and I shared this and it was very good.  Very odd though (in a good way) for a fast food place.  * Classic Smashburger - Excellent.  Perfectly juicy and tasty.  Definitely one of the best fast food burgers I've tasted.  You can see and taste that the ingredients were very fresh.  * Smashfries and Sweet Potato Smashfries = No bueno!!!  I was really looking forward to eating these, but I didn't think they were very good at all.  I just do not enjoy rosemary on my fries.  French fries shouldn't taste like soap or something.  I don't know - maybe I'm just not fancy enough to like random herbs on my fries.  At the very least they could have went farther down fancy lane and provided some aioli which would have been nice.  Next time I'm going to hold the flowers and order regular fries for sure.  I know I wasn't paying but I feel this place is overpriced.  An average of $6-$7 for a burger or chicken sandwich seems a bit high.  By the time you add fries and a drink you are over $10 which is way high for a fast food place.  I really wanted to try the veggie frites but they were out so maybe next time I'll give them a whirl.  I may give the fried pickles a shot as well because I am very curious as I had never tried one before.  Anyway, my first Smashburger experience was a pleasant one and I would like to return to get another burger, try their regular fries, get some veggie frites and maybe a fried pickle.",

It is hit or miss with the staff as far as friendliness, and that goes for management as well. The burgers are very small, and need seasoning! The chicken is very bland, with no seasoning as well. The breaded chicken always has a burnt taste and is never juicy. I am about ready to boycott this restaurant. They have very overpriced food for what you get. I also don't like the fact that every time I go in there to eat most of the tables are dirty. They always ask how your food is when you have a mouth full of food too. Someone should teach the servers the 101 basics of serving. I believe they should lower their prices for what you get. The whole like concept of smashed just makes me think of them being cheap. The thin burgers and the super smashed chicken are not what we want to pay for. I think it's time Smashburger did a revamp of their menu!!",

The burgers are some of the best around - I think that most of the people who are complaining about greasy burgers are mistaking the juiciness of the burger with grease.  These are juicy, drippy burgers....Yum!  We've never been disappointed.  The kids love this place.  The only downside that I will definitely agree on is that for a restaurant of this caliber, the prices are a bit higher than some places.  That being said, most restaurants are raising prices and will probably continue to do so.  MUCH better than The Habit, but the tradeoff is that SmashBurger is also more expensive.  I recently scored a deal on DealChicken which was $12 for $24 dollars worth of food.  Keep your eyes open for coupons and offers on Groupon and DealChicken!  Contrary to what most people said, we have NEVER waited in line and have always received immediate service.  We have only eaten in, never take out.  That being said, we've aways gone in the evening for dinner and not for lunch.",

    "text": "I stopped by on my way home tonight to give Smashburger a try.  I opted for the 1/3lb Arizona smashburger (hooray for spicy!) and an order of sweet potato fries, and the bill came out to almost $9.  This was certainly more than I would normally pay for a burger and fries (and no drink), but I was curious to try a smashburger, and I had known going in that it would be more expensive than the average fast food fare.  After I ordered, the girl at the counter said that it would be ready in about 8 minutes.  I went to the bathroom to wash my hands, and when I came out, my food was packed up and ready to go.  Sweet!  They must have used the super heavy duty deluxe edition smasher for my burger, because it took about 30 seconds for the order to be completed.  One thing I did like about the to-go box is that it is waxed on the inside, so the oil isn't seeping out and soaking the cardboard.  I hate going to In n Out etc., getting an order bagged up, and by the time I get home, the bottom is just grease.  Moving onto the food...the burger was actually pretty good.  It had the perfect kick to it with the habanero cheese, chipotle mayo, and fresh jalapenos.  It was a little messy, but I guess when you pile on all that stuff, plus onions, lettuce, a tomato ring and guacamole, it's hard not to make a mess.  Reminds me of the Carl's Jr.'s \"If it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face\" campaign!  Oh, the good old days.  The sweet potato fries were just okay in my book.  Maybe it was just my batch, but the kitchen seemed to go a little too trigger happy with the salt.  The order was pretty small also (think somewhere between a Mcdonalds small and a medium order of fries), so I was a little underwhelmed.  All in all, I'd still prefer In n Out for their consistency and price, but I'd hit up Smashburger once in a while just to get something different than a #1 w/grilled onions, fries well-done, and a pink lemonade.",

The fries seem like they would be good. However, after you eat a few, you are just done with them. Your tatse buds are saying eeee, that is enough. However, I did like the burger that I got, it was nice and hot when I got it as well. The Truffle Mushroom Burger was my choice today, though I did not get the mayo on it . I do not like Mayo for any reason. High price, not too bad , but still not my favorite.",

There was a line the whole time we were there but the restaurant wasn't full. It took us about 30-40 minutes from getting in line and then sitting and waiting for us to get our food. Luckily there were no issues when it arrived, but we were really hungry :(  It seemed like they were very short staff, sometimes there would be no one taking orders because someone would have to run to the back to help deliver food. I will probably give them another try but based on other locations I've been to, the service was not up to par.",

It wasn't much of a wait today but I've been there before where there is a good long line. The wait staff is always very friendly and helpful. My order came out within 5 minutes. I usually get the sweet potato fries but I opted for the regular fries this time, next time I'll stick with the sweet potato.  Because everything is ordered separately it's a little pricier than some burger joints. I paid $9 for hamburger and french fries, but it's worth it because everything is fresh & they're always juicy.",

The fried veggies are just baby carrots and green beans deep fried that glistened in oil and had no seasoning. The chocolate milkshake was good but not worth the ten minute wait in line.",

    "text": "Went into Smashburger for a late lunch yesterday with my hubby. He had eaten there before but it was my first time there and I was excited by all the fun options to customize your burger. I got a 1/3 pound burger on a chipotle bun with ketchup, mustard, pickle and haystack onions. I also got an order of sweet potato fries and a chocolate shake.   The girl taking the order was extremely friendly and offered me a cup for water since my shake would take a while. But it really wasn't long at all before someone brought out our food. Unfortunately they had forgotten the haystack onions on my burger and it took a while to come back after that. While we waited, I took in the ambiance of the place. I know some reviewers criticized it as too trendy but I have to say that I liked the decor. And I also enjoyed the music selection. Given that kind of vibe and the fact that they serve some good bottled beer, this would almost be a place to meet some friends after work. However, instead of that kind of crowd it was mostly middle-aged couples, obviously out on a weekend excursion to the nearby Lowe's, each with 2+ kids in tow.   However much I do enjoy trendiness, I think the food is still the most important aspect of a restaurant. And I did not enjoy my burger half as much as I thought I would. I don't mind the fact that it is smashed thin and overcooked - I like them very well done. But it was so greasy, it just really didn't have a good flavor at all. And the chipotle bun tasted like a regular white bread to me, I did not get any spiciness from it at all. I love sweet potato fries but these were inconsistently cooked. Some were burnt and saw were almost raw. The chocolate shake was just ok. Overall, I think I would have preferred the burgers/shakes from Jack in the Box.",

I ordered the Colorado burger which was the limited time special with the seasoned buffalo fries. First of all, as previously stated, the burger patty was small and not flavorful (especially for the price!!!) jalepenos were one of the ingredients on the burger and there was more jalepenos on the burger than meat. I had to take half of them off to even taste anything besides jalapenos. Next the buffalo fries.... they were possibly the worst fries I've ever tasted in my life. I love franks sauce and usually like my fries with it but the powdered crap that they put on the fries is pure salt. So much salt that it left that tangy sour after taste. We sent the fries back and asked for the original ones which were no better than McDonald's. we also ordered 2 kids meals that my children did enjoy, the patty was the same size as the one that was on my adult meal. Do not recommend this place.",

The entrance and exits are completely out of whack.  Get rid of the wall that is directly in front of the door when you enter, please!!   The place needs to be redesigned, excepting the back half of the restaurant is  not changeable by any restaurant standards, it's narrow, dark and not a good eating atmosphere.  If nothing else, they need to change the lighting in the place and give it a MUCH different ambiance.   But let's get past that and get to the food (still, the setup of a restaurant can greatly increase or decrease your appetite and your enjoyment of the food you are eating).   Burgers and fries, they go hand in hand. You don't really have one without the other. So, the fries are also pretty bad.  Unbelievably greasy.  To the point the grease drips off the fries and into the bottom of the cup they are served in and pooling.  Fingers covered with grease.  The fries are skinny and short. I don't mind the skinny part, I do mind the short part.  Hard to dip into ketchup.  I was in the semi trying to just eat the fries and constantly using a napkin to get the grease off of my fingers.    I ordered an Arizona burger. Now I'm going into the positive mode. That thing was awesome.  I don't know what kind of bun that is, but it's very good.  The burger was a perfect blend of various ingredients and it was delicious.  If the burger hadn't been as  good as it is, I would have given this place a 2 star rating.  I did have them add grilled onions to mine, but even without them it still would have been a very good burger.    That's it.  This location has great burgers.",

First off, I couldn't even finish my overpriced burger because it was making my stomach turn. The terrible shoe-stringed fries didn't help either. Oh yeah and the iced tea tasted very watered down and gross. The bathrooms were not cleaned whatsoever, there was toilet paper and paper towels all over the place, and the toilet seat top itself wasn't even on.   Bottom line....take my advice and go to IN N OUT burger instead. Better food, happier wallet.",

Both myself and my significant other work in food and we've come here a few times only to be very uncomfortable with the service. The cashiers are incredibly rude and unhelpful. We had to wait for her to finish texting before she could take our order on a busy Saturday afternoon. The line was out the door and food was stacked up on the counter, but there was no one in sight to take orders at the counter OR serve food. When someone would come up to take orders, they would walk very slow and the whole vibe made us feel anxious and uncomfortable. There were only 4 people working on a Saturday afternoon but none of them seemed to care about falling behind or being busy. I'm not sure why they treat their customers this way. People are always visibly disappointed with the quality of service- even though interactions with cashiers and servers happen for a brief time.",

I had the dog with me so I didn't want to be in long, so I placed an online order so I could just walk in and get it. I came in 20 mins after the order was placed and it wasn't done. There were maybe 2 people ahead of me but the employees seemed mostly new so it wasn't a big deal that it wasn't ready.  When I finally got my food I left and checked the food in the car and found out I got the wrong burger.  Again, the employees seemed new and mistakes happen so no big deal. I went in and asked for the right sandwich. It took some time to get the kid at the counter to understand what to do, but eventually he got it. He went back to ask to have my sandwich made again and the manager Tony comes storming up demanding to know what was wrong. I explained again that i got the wrong sandwich but they were remaking it. Instead if accepting that, tony brought me over to the screen where they show the orders and condescendingly tells me about how the orders placed online show exactly what was ordered (I guess he was trying to accuse me of trying to rip them off). I let him know that the order on the screen was correct but the burger was still wrong. Eventually I got the correct thing but there was no reason to be rude about a freaking cheeseburger,  especially as a manager.",

My partner and I have gone there on several occasions, and it's all been consistently decadent.  Yes, the hamburgers are a bit salty, but isn't that the point?  Aren't you supposed to have a greasy burger after a night of fun?  I've had a number of items on their menu--from the fried pickles to the haystack onions to one of their delicious shakes--and nothing has disappointed.  Everything's been made exactly like I'd want it to be and nothing has failed to delight.  Sure, you don't want to eat here every day.  It's meant as a sinful treat, like on your cheat day during your regular healthy eating schedule.  I'd stay on the meat wagon, just to have one of their delicious burgers on an egg bun with sharp cheddar cheese any day!",

Waiting is a bit of a pain, but it's typically not too long. The food takes a few minutes too, which is a positive in my book. The food here feels a lot fresher and better than fast food, though if you've seen their burgers, it's not a place that's super healthy.  They also offer chicken sandwiches (crispy or grilled), and salads, so there are some healthier options, but the winners here are the burgers and fries. Definitely try the smash fries. Tossed in olive oil, garlic and rosemary, they are delicious. Burgers are really good and juicy, and the ingredients they use seem fresh.  Cons are the long lines, and it's also not a place where you'll be in and out in 15 minutes. It's also not inexpensive. A burger, fries and a drink will run you $10-11, which seems high for \"fast food\", though I think it's worth it. What's nice though, is that you sit down with your number and they bring you your food, and they'll bus your table, so it feels like a combo of fast and full service...I suppose this is a perfect example of \"fast casual\".   It's pretty close to my office, so I'll be back often. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area and craving a burger.",

I was really glad to see the choices available to me when ordering. I chose the  1/2 lb BBQ Bacon and Cheese SmashBurger. IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST BURGERS I HAVE EVER HAD.

After being lured in by the clean signage (which looks remarkably similar to gamestop... in fact this is originally how we found out about this place...) the simple menu, and a decent smell I must admit I am completely dissapointed.  Court ordered a 1/3 while I splurged for the 1/2 pound burger, we mixed it up with sweet potato fires, and onion strings what we found was the following.  Every person who eats here must be;  Fat and used to having to dig around the grease pool our burgers were swimming in. Stupid by being conned into paying $25 dollars (we shared a drink) for $5 worth of burger materials and $2 worth of the measliest portion of fries possible....  My 1/2 pound burger was flat as a pancake and had literally 2 inches of meat in a ring around the bun.....slothered with a sickening sweet BBQ sauce, cheese and a single onion string, it had completley (I mean literally) soaked both sides of the bun with grease to the point where I removed the bun and squeezed it our as you might ring out a towel.....gross.  The onion strings were okay for pre bought stuff, you can get the same thing at chilis except they charge $1 less and actually strain them before serving.  Courts burger at least fit the bun (points for that) but was salty as anything which suggests they are keeping the meat way longer than they should......same issues with the grease.....literally I feel acne growing on my face just thinking about it....  The sweet potato fries were uninspired and greasy again, I have never had a bad sweet potato fry until yesterday......I guess it had to happen sooner or later.  I must admit after eating at literally hundreds of burger joints this is by far the worst which is sad because there is major potential  We got about halfway through our meal before we couldn't stomach it anymore....I have a stomach of iron....and felt sick all day after eating just 1/4 of a burger and a few onion strings and fries.....  Main Complaints;  Grease and Ingredients Measly portions of sides (for $3 a side I would expect more....) Smallest Drinks I have ever seen ($3 for a 'Large' for what McDonalds calls a small.... come on people)  Long story short if this was my only option I would starve.....best of luck to all you facing this grease burger the only thing I wanted to smash after finishing was my face into a toilet bowl.....",

    "text": "I was able to go try SmashBurger for the first time the other night at the Sin City Burger VIP Party. I have to say, it was pretty darn good.   Staff was super friendly and helpful in letting us know what they're favorites were. The location is clean and very contemporary, but it still had a 50's burger joint feel. I liked it.  My husband and I both ordered the Sin City burger, since it was the guest of honor. I got the 1/3 lb (there was a 1/2 lb available too) and it was stacked with sauteed onions, thick cut apple wood bacon, a fried egg and then their shoestring onion rings on top of a golden kaiser roll. Holy crap, the 1/3 was huge! I couldn't imagine the 1/2 pounder. I could only eat half (which of course made my husband happy). Anyway...it was good! I was curious about the fried egg aspect, but it was like breakfast on a burger. Burgers good. Breakfast good. My only thing was it was a tad salty for my taste, but luckily for me they had Four Peaks Kilt Lifter available with a frosted cold mug. :) :) :)  We also ordered the rosemary fries and the shoestring onion rings on the side. I was a fan of the fries...I loves me some rosemary. They were cooked to crispy yet mealy perfection. The onion rings were okay. I liked them better on top of the burger as opposed to the side. Would like to try their sweet potato fries next time.  We were also given the Cactus Vanilla milk shake to try. Again very good, I had no complaints, I just wasn't sure I tasted the cactus. I could have and not known it, but it tasted like a regular vanilla milk shake to me. Next time the hubby and I decided will order a vanilla milkshake and a cactus vanilla and compare. Can't go wrong with two milk shakes too.  Did I mention they had frosted cold mugs for the beer?  So yup, we will go back! Try it, you'll like it!",

Third time, yesterday? Enough to say we wont go back. Ever.   Lovely and I sat in a sticky booth, he ordered 1/3 lb classic, me the bbq grilled chicken - both with a small soda. Soda was disgusting, flat, watery, gross. Upon the lovely's complaint, the bus boy brought him bottled water. I took one bite of my sandwich and was assaulted by hair. Gak. We got up and left our food. Jeff told the manager about the food and the soda, we got our money back with an apology saying they were sorry we 'didn't have a better experience'. Um. A better experience??? Seriously? 15 dollars?   Ugh.",

Second, waited 20 minutes for food to cook (just two burgers!) and heard \"Victor\" quietly called by the female employee with shorter shoulder length reddish hair next to the pick up counter. My name is Victoria, so I didn't try grabbing the order because Victor is NOT my name. Now, I understand it could've been cut off or something, but my receipt said my full name and this employee didn't try calling the name a second time or see if she had gotten the name wrong, so I figured \"Okay, that must not be my order\". Lo and behold, 10 minutes later after people who ordered after me were getting their orders, I approached the counter and asked nicely \"Do you have any orders for Victoria yet?\" And this inconsiderate employee barely glances at me and shoves the bag towards me without a single word.  Won't be returning because of that employee specifically.",

Add on a side of smash fries and I walk away a happy carnivore nearly every time.  The other night, I gave the Arizona Grilled Chicken a try. The meat was surprisingly good for grilled. Cooked through. What made it remarkable were the spicy toppings. I don't consider myself a \"heat wimp\" but the peppers had me chugging coke after each bite. It wasn't the most pleasant experience, but I was still satisfied with my choice.   Aside: One of the cashiers was quite pleasant while the other guy, who took or order, acted like it was forced labor. Or, like he was too good for taking burger orders, literally taking a long swig of his beverage as we concluded our order.   Smashburger is not the best of the best in terms of burger establishments, but for the speed and price, it does the trick.",

    "text": "A burger for me is a once or twice a month type deal. The rotation generally includes 5 guys and In and Out, with the occasional guilty pleasure of a \"4 for 4\" deal at Wendys. I think I tried Smash Burger when it was newer in Chicago 4 or so years ago and wrote it off as overpriced and poorly executed. My return trip was motivated by an aggressive coupon, but again I arrived at the same conclusion.  The main gripe was my $8 \"big smash\" had less beef as the little cheeseburger at 5 guys, it was a pretty serious disappointment that their larger option was super thin and didn't extend past the small bun. Also the term smash, really shouldn't apply to what I was served. The patty was spongy and lacked any type of smashed crust that is supposedly this chain's signature. Because the patty was flacid, it was just dripping with excess grease. It wasn't that far away to what a Wednys would serve on good day. My burger was bundled with both bacon and crispy onion strings, but I maybe received a pinch of each. Portion control to the extreme really brought this burger down a notch.  The positives include quality customer service, and I was served surprisingly quick. Maybe 3 minutes after my order was placed. Perhaps they substituted a pre-cooked regular size for my \"big\"? The fries were quite enjoyable, as they are so thin and small they are guaranteed to be hot and crispy.  Smash burger was a terrible value, my basic and underwhelming bacon cheeseburger combo was $12.50. No thanks.",

    "text": "Seeing that there isn't a Smashburger near where I live, I like to make it a point to visit the house of smash at least once every time I'm out in the Phoenix area. That being said, I think it's pretty clear that I enjoy a good smash.  The burger itself is good, you can tell that the meat is of decent quality and it tastes good to boot. Maybe a little more seasoning to really make the flavor pop, but that's just my opinion. What really makes Smash that much better is the various toppings that go on the burger. There are so many different options that there's bound to be a combination that you're going to enjoy. The toppings are also really good. Now I know that it sounds a little strange to be praising the toppings more than what should be the star of a burger, but in all honesty, that's how it rolls here, they really change the dynamic of what essentially a naked burger.  Oh, and the sides, kinda hit and miss. The Smash fries, I personally feel are a little overrated. I like my fries to have a saltiness factor in them, and with their signature smash fries, it just wasn't there. The flavor was alright, don't get me wrong, but the parmesan and rosemary flavors didn't do it for me. Now the fried pickles and veggie fries? That's where it's at. The pickles may have been a little on the salty side (even for me), but they were packed with flavor, and were really delicious. The flash fried veggies were also a real treat. Who knew that plopping raw veggies in a fryer for a few seconds would make them amazing?  All in all, Smashburger is a darn tasty place to get a burger. Just make sure to load it up with some decent toppings to round out the flavor. Oh, and get fried pickles on the side. You'll thank me later.",

    "text": "I'm a huge Smashburger fan, my frequented stores located at Norterra and Desert Ridge. This location SUCKS.  I went for lunch with someone who has never had Smashburger before. I wish I had been paying attention when he ordered because he ended up getting a pretty plain burger, no fixins. He said he assumed they came with lettuce, tomato, etc. and that the girl at the register did not ask what he wanted on it.  Second problem, the ice was being filled in the beverage dispenser and some genius employee unplugged the machine first and decided to not tell anyone, not even the girl filling the ice! Several customers asked staff what was up with the drinks, but nobody investigated the problem until I made sure someone understood, \"The beverage machine does not seem to be ON.\" Took a lot of head-scratching before Mr. Genius came out and said, \"Oh! I unplugged it! Haha...\". This whole fiasco led to about 20 customers needing drinks all at the same time.  THIRD and possibly the most inexcusable problem. My fries... were SWIMMING in oil. I was able to eat most of them, but there were quite a few that were inedible. I will post a picture. It was really gross. You can clearly see the oil slick on the fries, what's harder to see is the POOL underneath them, but it was definitely there. What kind of half-assed, lazy fry-cook allows this to happen? I really wanted to complain about this, but given that it was A. very busy and B. low-caliber employees I'd have to deal with, I figured it was just not worth the hassle.   Avoid this location, especially if introducing someone new to Smashburger.",

    "text": "First time visit. I got a classic on egg bun with cheddar, tomato, grilled onions, ranch, and mayo. Also ordered a small drink and reg fries. The fries were shoestring and I prefer the fatter ones but the real issue was that they were cold. I don't like any fries that aren't hot when they are put in front of me. Also, they brought my soda in a plastic glass so I could not take it with me when I left; normally I would ask for a to-go cup but they were so busy I couldn't be bothered. Just serve it in a paper cup and be done with it! Now, the burger - really good. I would not order the grilled onions again as they were cooked on a dirty grill and tasted weird. However, the meat was great along with all the other toppings, and the bun was delicious. Had to take off a star for the price though - $11 something for my meal. Ouch. I will try this place again to see if I can bump up the stars to four.",

We started our experience in the restaurant with a woman who was already at the counter explaining her disgust with the presentation of her food. As we picked up our order and took it home, we experienced the same unsatisfactory service. The patties themselves resembled asphalt after an 8.0 earthquake, just cracked, crumbled and tossed onto buns that were apparently picked out of a bag that was used as bean bag chair. I'm guessing this is why it is called \"smash\" burger? The toppings presentation must have been applied by a school cafeteria worker as they were completely separated like a lunch tray. I only rate this experience 2 merely because they at least served everything ordered, although it seems they kept it in an active clothes dryer to keep it warm until we came to pick it up. (which was set on delicate because the food was still luke warm.)",

    "text": "Tried Smashburger for the first time a few weeks ago. I have to say that I really enjoyed it. I ordered the Arizona burger (chipotle mayo, habenero cheese, jalapenos, guac, lettuce, tomato) and sweet potato fries. The burger was spicy which i loved. The burger patty had alot of flavor which was surprising because I always thought that smashing a burger makes the juices and flavor run out. This was not the case. The sweet potato fries were really good and I liked that they put rosemary and oil on those. The sweet potato fries were a great compliment to the spicy burger. The hubby had the mushroom swiss burger with smash fries. He enjoyed both as well. Decor was cool and the service was fine. The only complaint I have is the price. It was 21.00 for my husbands 1/2 pound burger, my 1/3 pound burger, and the two orders of fries. Its actually cheaper to go to Fuddruckers and we get more food from Fuddys as well. I will say though that Smash burger was mighty tasty so I would still go back.",

There's a small sink right there too (it had dirty dishes in it) so they should be required to wash hands in between handling money and preparing food. If you order the BBQ bacon cheddar burger get extra sauce because mine only had a tiny smear on the bun. My shake had more milk than ice cream so I'd skip that $4.50+ item altogether. The fried pickles are the only reason I'd return, and to a different location.",

Took 30 minutes to get through, the bag with fries and tater tots was leaking grease all over the counter, and ... I had ordered online, but didn't pay until I got there - big mistake. They claimed the order had been paid for by someone else, then they fixed it, but it took 10 minutes to fix the order and get a new total for me.   Orders are almost alway wrong at this location. Like if I order online and change what comes on a burger, it's never right. They do stuff like leave the BBQ sauce off a BBQ cheddar burger.   Everyone that picks up a go order goes off to the side to go through it, I guess because they get it wrong so often. I have emailed complaints several times, but I don't want a coupon - I want fast service and the order be correct. How hard is that? See \"In and Out\" if you want some training.",

I have tried many of their menu items and liked all of them.  Two burgers are my very favorite burgers ever!  One comes with bacon, avocado, tomato, and lettuce-- and I sometimes get it protein-style, on lettuce without a bun.  The barbecue, bacon, haystack onions, etc. with a biggie burger on an egg bun is a special treat!  Sometimes I will get these burgers with smash grilled  chicken -- also delicious!  And the salads are equally tasty.  The greens are always fresh, and there are many combo choices.  It is my favorite place to get lunch or dinner, either to eat there or to take home.  Tony is the General Manager and his standard is to make everyone feel welcomed and happy to be at Smashburger.",

The ordering process was pleasant and the cashier was nice. The floor was greasy enough that I fell, mind you I'm was wearing a boot with no heel, and sober as the day is long. Every table was dirty except the one the manager was giving an interview at and once he had left the dining room after the interview he did not help get any tables clean or delegate anyone else to do so. The chicken sandwich was good. I mixed it up and got the goat cheese and spinach with the balsamic glaze. The only food complaint I had was the fries were extra greasy. Below average experience for a concept I genuinely enjoy.",

My husband ordered the Arizona burger and said it wasn't spicy at all...his fries were also COLD.  The restaurant itself was kind of a train wreck.  I know it's supposed to be trendy, but Ke$ha at full blast doesn't help an already mediocre experience.  The ice maching was out of ice and there was no silverware.

As I was waiting for my to-go order (quoted 5 - 7 minutes, took 10 - 15) I saw numerous patrons attempt to leave the same way they came in, which is where the line was.  The traffic pattern inside is very poorly designed.    I was greeted nicely by a cashier  that looks like she needs to remove her funky earring and get back into high school and get her diploma, but she was friendly and efficient, until she needed to count out the 46 cents in change.  Yes, some people still use cash.  I ordered a mushroom-swiss SmashBurger for me and a Classic for my father.  I added on the sweet-potato fries and a shake.    Since the burgers took a while I had time to savor an outstanding milkshake.  Handmade & mixed, and it tastes of quality.  After I got back to my office, I tore into the burger, which was moist, jucy, and flavorful.  A really outstanding burger that befits the fast-casual restaurant.  Not as impressed with the sweet potato fries though - as my colleage Jason B. mentioned, it seems that they are trying to do too much with them.    2 burgers, a shake and side of fries was almost $20.  Of course, you're paying for quality, but that is very pricy, and I'm not sure it fits the demographic of the area.  I'm certainly down to go for a special occasion, but I just don't see this as any more than an once-a-month place.",

It may have been the presentation (open-faced on a chrome wire rack).  It may have been the ultra-soft bun.  I subconsciously held the burger with my little fingers aloft, much as if I were eating a cress sandwich at a British high tea.  The patty was a bit crusty around the edges--not burnt, just texturally unusual, much like a Butterburger at Culver's.  The meat grind had a rather loose texture; I expected more density to the patty, but it had good flavor and wasn't greasy.  The sharp cheddar was proper sharp cheddar.  The dill slices were far and away the best part of the burger--where did they get those amazing pickles?  It was a good burger.  A pricey good burger.  A pricey good burger with a molecular gastronomy vibe about it.  Two stars because I want a burger, not a post-modern burger experience.",

    "text": "****Don't go here!*****  Well here we go with some amazing customer service. My lady and I went here a couple of weeks ago and our burgers came out pretty much raw. Not med rare, but not cooked. The manager on duty a younger gentleman came and apologized and had our burgers remade and they came out tasting amazing! After we ate and before we left the manager gave both my lady and I a free entree coupon that didn't expire till December 2019. Awesome right?! Nope! We went back today May 5th 2019 around 615pm and the place had all of one guest. My lady went first to the counter since the coupon only works one per order so we were gonna buy our own each. My lady gets done placing her order from a younger kid and then gives him the coupon. He tells my lady that it's already been used and we both look at him and say we got these about 2 weeks ago the last time we were there. The kid goes and gets his manager and she then tells us they updated their system and it no longer takes coupons. We both say okay we can we use these and she tells us since her system won't take it that she isn't going to do anything about it with a huge attitude like she was better than us. Not only did they try and call my lady a liar, but even though they initially tried to make up for something that probably happens a lot to a completely off putting vibe and manner of treating customers. Needless to say we cancelled her order and walked next door to Chipotle. I will never go back to this location of this lady manager in a red shirt is gonna continue insult and treat people with utter disrespect.",

The Assistant Manager rang me up. Got my order in quick and fast. No hassle with the coupon. Got my drink and sat down. Kid you not, less than 10 minutes later my order was at my table. Talk about fast. Sweet Potato Fries were cooked perfect. My burger was very juicy. A little over cooked but no complaints. I was in and out in 20 minutes. Well done! Great job to this team.

The wait for the burgers was longer than it should have been first off.  Then my partner and I got our bags with burgers and fries, and both of our orders were wrong.  My burger had tomatoes on it but even worse, they gave my partner the wrong fries and sandwich.  Even after going back and switching the orders they messed up our sandwich putting on mushrooms when my partner has a life threatening allergy to mushrooms.  Had he eaten this burger without paying attention, he may not be here.  I am so sad and disappointed that the manager specifically swapped and messed up these orders.  If he cannot keep orders correct and in line there is no wonder why the restaurant was backed up when we went in to eat.",

These were full of pink undercooked meat. I even heard the guy bagging the food \"double check\" with the cook. Yep, all good...not! I also ordered 2 sides of smash fries. Guess what? NOT Smash fries...regular fries. How sad. I can see messing up one thing, but two?! Thank goodness my order didn't have anything else to it.  On a side not, they have changed their fries. They used to be thin and long and now they are the medium sized ones you get at any fast food place. I have to say, I won't be back to this location. You dodge homeless people out front, parking is horrible and the inferior level of food service justify my decision. The only thing good about this visit was the girl who took the order, she was very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, she wasn't preparing the food! For the $19 I paid, I could've gone to McDonald's and got better, hotter, fresher food and probably more of it! Oh well, live and learn and avoid this Smashburger. Not worth it.",

My service and my food suffered from the staff being so eager to close that they failed to provide anything that was quality. Closing up shop an hour early will help get out out right at closing but ensures you won't have repeat customers.   Asked to wait to give my order. Asked what I wanted while the cashier walked away to talk with a peer instead of listening for an order. Made fun of for ordering friend pickles to go along with my food. Told that I made the wrong choice and i should have gone with Brussel sprouts.   Food came out fast but now i know why. Got home and there was no ranch for my pickles. Pickles were drenched in oil cause they clearly closed up the friers too early and oil temp dropped. Without ranch they were garbage anyways.   Entire bag was sopping wet cause they gave me some chewy bacon and quick cooked chicken that was sopping wet. With a soggy sandwich, no sauce, and oily pickles I was not able t enjoy my meal and will 100 not be back.   Kudos to Culver's for never giving such horrible sevice and food like Smash Burger. I suggest everyone take their business to Culver's.",

The bathroom and areas around trash cans looked like a storm had hit.   After ordering, we sat down and realized there were several people waiting on food. Also, the servers were noticeably arguing with the kitchen staff. We decided to look on Yelp to see reviews. That's when we realized we had stopped at the wrong place.   When we received our food, the hamburger was raw, as you can see in the picture below. We had them make another hamburger, which was fine. Also, the onion strings, pictured, looked as if they were picked up out of the trash. We didn't eat them out of fear for our health. We also had fries, which were cooked ok.   When we left, we let the shift manager know they should be embarrassed by the experience and food they are providing there.   We have a Smashburger in our neighborhood, Laveen, which we love. It is well run with good service and great food.   We have sent an email to the corporate office.",

One under salted. Not one, not two but three burgers. All under cooked.

Probably the closest to my favorite (\"Steak and Shake\" - none in the Valley or west of Texas) I have had. Opted for the  1/2 pound and it is too big.   Big  question is - worth more than twice the price ($4.99 for 1/3 pound and $5.99 for  1/2 pound) as for \"In and Out\" double-double and unfortunately the answer is no, I don't think so. Much like Fudruckers, which I would rate ahead of Smashburger for taste, it will be a \"once in a while place\" for me.  The \"Haystack Onion Rings\" were to die for, but a VERY small order, that without a sandwich are priced at a very pricey $2.99 ($1.99 with a sandwich)! Excellent!  Very clean, lots of help and nicely done, but prices are a bit much for fast food Hamburger.",

The burgers and fries are awesome, but honestly, we usually tend to lean towards the chicken sandwiches.  The grilled chicken is good, but being a southern girl, I can't resist the fried filet.  And the fried pickles!  If you've never tried these gems, you need to!  They're cheap (only $2.95 if memory serves) and they are amazing, especially with ranch to dip.   The staff is always friendly and the food always comes out quick and hot.  I've seen a lot of complaints about people waiting a long time for food, but in all the times we've gone, this has never been an issue.  Perhaps people don't understand that when there's a line to the door, you aren't the only person they're cooking for.   Anyway, if you're in the mood for a good, cheap burger, skip Burger King and hit up Smashburger.",

Usually most place if you call in your food you can skip the line and pay and collect your food. Not the case here. If you call in your food and wait the time for it to be ready your STILL have to wait in the 15+ min line to pay for your food. All this while your food is sitting there getting soggy and cold. Should maybe work on that part since they are flooded with a lot of people in the work force trying to get in and out first - hence calling in the order...",

    "text": "I really hoped this place would be better.  My biggest gripe is the food--everything else I can forgive. All burgers are served the same temp (well), which means the meat is frozen. For the price, I would expect more. That said, my mushroom swiss burger was good. The AZ smashburger had too much going on--a lot of conflicting flavors that didn't make a cohesive burger.   Fries: Smashfries: yum. Veg Frites: pass. They truly are still vegetables and taste like it.   Okay, and all the rest...  Service: an inefficient model. None of the workers seemed to have assigned posts, and milled around aimlessly. This probably caused the dirty seats. Milkshake delivery was similarly inefficient, tying up the people assigned to the cashier's desk until they finished blending the shakes. I would fix this, especially for busy high-peak times.   Practical advice: bring a sweater! there was quite a wind-tunnel in the place.",

The menu say that it comes with habanero cheese, but there was no cheese at all on the burger.  I went to the Smashburger website to provide feedback, but the feedback link didn't work.

The patties are on the thin side and are not cooked to order so they always come out medium well.  On your next visit make sure to check out the smash fries, which are their normal shoestring fries with a special seasoning blend and olive oil. They are a great departure from the norm. The service is usually pretty good which is impressive because it's a very young looking staff. I've had my order come out wrong one time out of the dozens of times I've been there which is forgivable. The facilities seem to be kept pretty clean which is a good indicator.  But while facilities and service can ruin a quick service experience they won't make the experience. The food is the main focus and Smashburger makes a delicious burger.",

The BF and I shared some smashfries which were weird tasting.... not really good.... just weird. I was hoping for more garlic flavor. Overall.... it was just a meh experience.",

    "text": "This place sucks. I have no idea why they seemed to be fairly busy when we were there on a Sunday afternoon.. the only feasible option being every person in there was either hungover or still drunk from the night before and needed something bland and greasy to coat their stomachs.  First of all, they don't offer a veggie burger. ..Seriously? Yet their menu online states they do. SO basically if you're vegetarian you can get something somewhat resembling a grilled cheese; or they'll offer to put a runny fried egg on top- appetite whetted? Note to the veg*ns: Not worth your time.  The boyfriend got the biggest burger possible and was thoroughly disappointed in everything on it. Somehow it was piled high with seemingly interesting ingredients yet he swore up and down it was less than lackluster, no taste at all. He also got their haagan dazs chocolate shake and it had only the slightest hint of a chocolate taste and was runny. Runny. Haagan Dazs, Shake. Doesn't make sense, right?  The bread is super gross and gets soggy. The only semi-redeeming item(s) are the fried pickles and flash-fried asparagus. But honestly, how can you muck that up?  Waste of money! Bring your business somewhere local.",

So, during my Tempe/Phoenix visit, I had to stop by a Smashburger to try the regional burger, the Arizona Smashburger.  I'm so pleased that the creators of Smashburger ran with the idea of a regional burger; that means I can try new burgers in new states.  (Okay, so I still have yet to try the Colorado burger, but I'm working on it!)  And the AZ burger was definitely a taste bud pleaser:  kaiser-type bun, guacamole, Pepperjack cheese, chipotle sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and jalapenos.  So freaken' tasty!  I wish I could get this burger more often.  Haven't tried Smashburger yet?  Get off your bum and get moving to your nearest location because you'll be hooked on these delicious burgers in no time.",

This place is good though, they immediately recognized that we had no idea what to do and walked us through the who order process.  Food, BBQ bacon and cheddar burger, smash fries and a side salad; came out quick and were tasty. Side salad had actual greens on it!! Wow, most burger joints just throw iceberg on a plate and assume you are annoying for ordering salad.  I wasn't super happy with the kid's straws (straws cut in half, which ruins the illusion of sterility completely) and the bathroom was a mess (despite the sign claiming the importance of a clean bathroom).

Unfortunately, I had a bad service experience, and, even though I will probably return, I'm upset after tonight with this specific location.  Here's why:  I got here around 5:30 and went with the all american burger with a haystack of onion rings.  There wasn't a whole lot of people in the place when I got there, but it soon started to fill up after I sat down and started to eat.  Halfway through my meal, I had finished my drink and needed a refill. I also figured since the onion rings were small, I would also grab a fork while I was up at the beverage station.  Mind you, the place was full at this point.   I stood up, took my purse, grabbed my drink and walked to the beverage station.  As I turned around, I saw one of the bus boys clearing my table. My burger wasnt even half eaten.  I started to go after him to leave my food, and he did not hear me.  He walked right by me with my dinner and continued on into the kitchen.  I was FURIOUS.  I had just paid $10 for a full meal, and this kid was taking it away.  (it was half the burger and half the fries, not the whole burger.)  While he walked into the kitchen, I grabbed one of the burger girls and told her what was going on.  I explained that I had gone to the drink station to get more pop and this kid took away my food and I wasnt done.  She told me to hold on a second, and grabbed the kid (who appeared to be in high school) and told me to tell him what I had told her.  I explained to him that I was NOT DONE EATING and he had taken away the rest of my dinner.  He apologized, as did the server.  I was still upset, and told him I didnt want an apology, I wanted the the rest of my dinner!  They offered to cook me up another burger and fries.  I decided to pass, as I was mostly full from what I had already eaten.  I asked them to get the manager and the kid ran in the back of the kitchen and never came back out.  I wanted them to know what had happened, so that way they would know.  I left and called the store when I got home and talked to the manager. I explained that I was upset, as anyone would be, and had wanted to talk to her about it in person, but the kid who went to get the manager never reappeared. It was upsetting for me all the way around.  The manager apologized and took my name and number.   They said that if I come in, I can have a gift certificate for a free meal there, which is what I had wanted in the first place.  Anyways, even though I love the food here, I dont know that I will be back to this specific location any time soon, due to this whole thing.",

Worth it?  Of course not.  Burger is okay, not great but not bad.  In n Out level?  No.  As good as Lobby's up the street?  Hell no.  The 5oz burger for $6 is almost insulting.  The bun is much too large for the amount of meat, the burger almost gets lost in there.  It is called a burger, please make it the main ingredient.  I got the Arizona burger and everything on it was good, but due to the small burger it kind of overwhelmed it.      I got the Smash fries which have rosemary and olive oil.  They were not good at all.  Very very greasy.  Not sure why you add oil back on to something that was just fried in oil.  Maybe the regular fries aren't as oily.  This is in the same category as Habit Burger.  Worth trying once, completely overpriced, very confused at how they grew beyond one location.    The friendly staff is the best part of the place but I can spend $5 at In n out for better fries, and a better burger all while sitting in my car.  Why pay double for something not as good?

    "text": "Being a Vegas resident I have heard a ton of positive about SmashBurger.  Before I continue this review, I need to throw out the disclaimer that I have difficulty ripping friendly people.  SmashBurger was very friendly.  Experience starts by walking into an utterly confusing design with no one behind the counter, no one to be found.  I stare at the menu plastered above the cash register for 3 whole minutes before the girl working the counter arrives. I have no idea that everything is a la carte, I am college educated, and  I am betting this is not a reflection of my intelligence.  The girl working the counter (no name tag) is incredibly friendly, and apparently quite stressed over the very limited supply of customers in the restaurant.  I order \"The Classic Combo\" and am quickly informed that no such item exists in SmashBurger.  Obviously the girl working here has limited fast food experience because she proceeds to ask me item by item what I want.  We narrow it down, after some discussion, to a hamburger, fries, a drink.  Add chili.. what the hell.  I just drove 309 miles, lets splurge!!  Price is circa $10.50.  A bit stiff, but hey if the food is good, no biggy...  I get a plastic cup (noteworthy because this is the machine washable style, not the to go style) then take my seat at a table covered in filth.  This is the cleanest table I could find, however.  I am certainly not ADD, but I made 3 trips to the soda dispenser to wet napkins with water to wipe down the table.  I am being watched by employees the entire time.  Food arrives:  Burger looks pretty friggen awesome!  Chili is in a cup, coated in cheese.  No fries.  Long story short, she did not add fries to my order, extra $2.18.  Meal grand total now circa $13.  A bit high for a hamburger.  You aren't Ruth Chris.  After more discussion, I get fries ordered, they show up about 5 minutes later.   The food:  Chili:  I love chili.  It will be the death of me.  This chili was very watery (I know, I should not have eaten it.  Everything in the last paragraph is my fault) and as the copious amounts of cheese melted it became very greasy.  I added a spoonful of chili to my hamburger and sampled the chili a few times until I realized my GI tract was preparing for war with me.  Hamburger: Excellent flavor.  Good job here.  Hard to mess this up, however, and not worth $10.  With the fluid drained chili that I put on it, it was pretty solid.  I may actually crave this item.  Better late than never French Fries:  Stiff, stale, no flavor.  I tried to dip them in chili for flavor, but it was watery to the point that they only came out brown, no real meat to them.  Doused in ketchup and salt, slightly tolerable.  Will not take this add on next time.  Service:  Very friendly.  The flighty girl working the counter was also apparently the server and expeditor.  Maybe they were short staffed today.  If not, horrible business plan.  When she is trying to get food out and to tables, people ordering are waiting. Likewise, when I can clearly see my food is ready and I am starving, I am waiting for an indecisive idiot to order.  This DOES NOT WORK!    Will I be back?  Probably not.  Do I hate them and would I steer you away?  Not really.  They have decent food but....  they lack value and need operational help.  In the end, the only thing SmashBurger smashed was my colon.  My fault for eating the chili!",

A lunch hour consist of 60 minutes which is nearly impossible to make at smashburger.  We always order food to go.  They always say there is a 5-7 minute wait which really ends up being AT LEAST 25 minutes.  You stand in a crowded little area waiting for your food with everyone staring at their watches or cell phones grumbling about how this is the last time they are coming here. However; you do get to watch the circus act that is the staff running around like a chicken with their head cut off.    That place is a revolving door.  There are new people everyday!  This place seems to be poorly designed.  I am a frequent visitor at popular restaurants I can handle the wait.. but to me ... burgers are something I go for when I need food quickly.    Now on to the food.  I usually order a chicken avocado club.  I cannot handle all the grease on their burgers.  That sandwich typically is good if someone decides to cook the bacon thoroughly.  The fries however.... well, let's just say I just got done cleaning off my desk because of the pools of grease.  Like I get it guys in the kitchen you are busy but man... it's like I ordered a cup of grease easy on the fries...  Needless to say I couldn't eat it. I prefer Lobby's Burgers or Five Guys over Smashburger just because of the service alone.",

Since I mentioned it was my first time here, the very helpful attendant gave me a brief tour of the menu and gave me some of his personal recommendations.  One of which was the \"classic\".  I also ordered the \"Smashfries\", and a chocolate milkshake.    It was served quite quickly despite how busy it was, and the server was very polite.  Then, the moment of truth, I bit into the burger and... All I can say, indescribably good.  Think In-N-Out, but with a better bun and less grease. Very, very tasty.  The fries, just wow. Thoroughly flavored with rosemary and garlic, but a little heavy on the olive oil.  They were absolutely delicious nonetheless.  The shake. Oh. My. Gosh.  The shake was rich and creamy. Perfect consistency!  My one and only complaint:  it is a teeny bit pricey.  I probably won't be a frequent customer due to that fact.
