It's just off the 51 @Northern so it's in a great location (driving wise).  If you are in the know, the joint is owned by the same guy who just opened Thirteen North restaurant a few doors west in the same plaza.  On to the food itself, my usual order in this place as my family swears by it is the whiteout pizza (ricotta, mozzarella, romano, garlic, tomato and fresh basil) baked on a freshly tossed dough.  Amazing.  We had the chicken wings as well as hot roast beef sub on italian bread before and we were quite pleased.  Yes, you can always go to Bianco, Parlor, Cibo for some fancy artisan pizza but for the value:taste ratio, my money is on Stumpy's.  A great neighborhood pizza joint.",

Not only did they charge my card with tip included, but they also charged my son when they delivered the pizza. (I was at work) when I came home I found out what happened and immediately called them, and never got a call back from the owner Chase like I told he was going to. I had to call back two days later, and finally talked to him. He then stated he would return the money for me as I deserved, because I only purchased one pizza. At the time I was understanding, but now two weeks later and still no refund. Then to find out he's been on vacation so that must mean he forgot.. I basically said I would stop by in person tomorrow and expect my refund in person. Not only have I had to deal with awful customer service, but I must say the pizza was not even good. Little Cesar's pizza is 100 times better including their customer service. Do not go there, and usually I am about supporting your local vendors, but not this one they break promises.",

I'm not a huge fan of any red sauce but they mix in a lot of cheeses which gives it more of a blended flavor.  Usually when I see \"baked\" and \"pasta\" I expect a soft, mushy mess, but the ziti had a lot of firmness to it which is what I want.  I didn't get around to eating the garlic bread until an hour after I ordered and I was expecting a brick, but somehow it managed to say soft.  Nice bonus.  I got a slice as well to try it out.  They serve thin pizza, but I'm more of a thick crust person, but it was good overall.  The crumbled sausage is just what I like.  The staff was friendly and they seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Nice place to take a family.",

Try the plain pepperoni (don't need to get too fancy, this is a winner).  Addon the antipasta sale, and \"suicide wings\" and you are good to guy.  For the courageous at heart - go with the Philly Cheesesteak pizza (a super surprising treat).  If you get delivery, don't forget to ask for parmesan and peppers (they never bring it no matter how much I tip - which is always very generous).  Oh well.  Have fun, and find your sizzle!

My only qualm is that they close a little early (for a pizza place) and they aren't open on Sundays. BUT, it's a small \"mom and pop\" shop and everyone needs a day off and some family time, right??

The wings were ordered hot double baked BBQ, and I must say they were pretty good, I'll definitely other them in the future. The BBQ sauce had a touch of spice and the wings were a bit crunchy, and made a great combination. The pizza we order was okay... I will not be ordering a pizza with those toppings in the future.   The cook recommended to order a cheese calzone, and boy was that good! I ordered both calzones and the cheese one was a hit, the other one would not be order again, the reason was because it had pepperoni , veggies and bacon, and it overpowered the taste of the cheese plus it tasted very similar to a pizza.   Their customer service is great! It was our second time there and they remember my boyfriend's last order. The cashier was very kind and helpful as well .",

The pizza is always ready prompt and piping hot and fresh and they very frequently have coupons available which is an added bonus to their already reasonable prices!  Love this mom and pop!",

I decided to order a pizza from Stumpy's.   Meh. It wasn't awful, it wasn't inedible, but it didn't knock my socks off. The sauce was a little plain and I ordered extra cheese on my pizza and got just enough cheese to cover the sauce.  I am willing to try Stumpy's again because the service is so friendly and the pizza is prepared right in front of you. Maybe I should start with a plain pepperoni before going into the sausage and onion realm. Maybe I got a little crazy on my first trip. No...I don't think so, but I'm willing to give them another shot.",

I have a NEW pizza spot while I'm at my girlfriends now, I HIGHLY recommend (if you already haven't) you try it!",

The service was prompt and friendly!   EVERYONE should give this place a try, especially if you are from the East Coast and miss Italian grinders. I know they call it \"classic\" and I'm not sure what the original recipe for Italian grinders is, but I know back home they use different deli meat. It's similar but BETTER!!!  1/13 Ordered a hot pastrami on Italian without onions and one word DELICIOUS!!!! 5 Stars   1/20  Ordered a small bacon and pepperoni pizza well done!  4 Stars  Oatmeal cookie - soft and delicious  5 Stars",

Unassuming, in a nondescript strip mall, but as soon as we walked in, and I smelled the sauce, I knew I was in for something good!   The employees were all super friendly, giving recommendations, getting our order to the line fast. Our food was out pretty quick, considering it was during the lunch rush and everything is made fresh.   Our group got a few different slices and we all loved them! Thin, crispy crust, flavor packed sauce, fresh cheese, awesome toppings. The pizza was so, so good! They even offered to cut my kids slices into small pieces to make it easier for them to eat, which was so nice!   I love that they offer slices, but make them fresh, sauce, cheese, and toppings, instead of reheating slices of a premade pizza like other places.   Our group left all giving it 5 stars!!",

Stumpy's most definitely is neighborhood spot and possibly make the best Italian Cold Cut sub I've had in Phoenix. What I loved abut it was nothing about I the sub taste \"classic\". It was certainly an Italian sub ... Thick cut salami, provolone (smoked), but it didn't taste like a Classic Italian sub from back east. I loved it!!! Absolutely loved it!!   Will definitely go back in a few weeks. Oh... I ordered by Italian sub cold ... Yelpers love it hot!! I'm trying it hot next time!",

They told us it would take 15-20 mins. It was less than that. I bought a medium cheese pizza for the kids, and ordered a large half \"Works\" and half \"Philly\" pizza. We were charged $1 extra for having two sauces. But that was cool because we got to try more than one pizza.  Really small hole in the wall. They were very unorganized on the phone I will admit. I was put on hold while the waitress talked to someone else. She didn't put me on mute so at first I didn't know who she was talking to. I called back a second time and the same thing happened. I was about to hang up again but we were hungry, and hunger won out. I could hear that the delivery time would be about 45 mins. for a late Saturday night and decided to pick it up.  Our pizzas were about $35 for the two. Great crust, lots of toppings, good amount of sauce. My husband came back to the hotel with the yummy goodness and was stopped several times by people asking where he went. He gave them the coupons from the top of the box. I hope they got business from that. We'd definitely order from them again when in AZ.",

Missing 1 bad wing was not a big deal but the feeling of your order was messed up when you checked it out at home was unpleasant.

As a born and raised New Yorker, I'm pretty judgmental on pizza and am very picky.   Although I haven't seen claims of Stumpy's modeling their pizza after NY pizza like most business do out here (and epically fail), I think their pizza is phenomenal and definitely the best in town. It may not be New York-good as far as my absolute favorite places in NY, but very close and comparable to the pizza I grew up eating. For a great price this is definitely my go-to neighborhood pizza and sandwich place!",

    "text": "When I first moved to the Phoenix area, a co-worker directed me to this place. I had an amazing club sandwich on the freshest bread possible. Despite telling everyone how delightful it was and driving by frequently, for years I never went back! Fortunately, my husband and I moved relatively close and are lucky enough to be within their delivery area.   Our first delivery consisted of The Greek pizza and The Big Dipper sandwich. Our second, The Big Dipper. The third, The Big Dipper. Seeing a trend here? The Big Dipper is amazing. It's sliced Roast Beef, Smoked Provolone, Garlic Butter, and Au Jus all toasty and warm. We've also had their Homemade Meatballs and Garlic Toast with Mozzerella and Marinara. The meatballs definately satisfied a craving, and while the sauce really makes the meatballs, I thought the beef was a little dry. The garlic toast was highly addictive and we've ordered it again.   I would recommend Stumpy's to anyone and everyone. Sure, it's tucked away next to my dentist and doesn't look like much from the outside (or inside) but the food is delicious. Also, the employees are friendly and look happy. The best part is that Stumpy's is a local business!",

It's cheap if you have one of their coupons that they give out so often, and it's better tasting and a lot less greasy than any of the chain pizza places you usually go to.  My advice would be to spend the extra dollars on their specialty pizzas because they are definitely worth it. They and huge and loaded with toppings, and there is something for everyone. Stumpy's is really good for their prices and I go here for a movie night or a birthday party or for a little guilty pleasure. I love The Works pizza.",

Great crust, super light.  Great cheese, yes, the quality of cheese matters.  Sauced perfectly and topped accordingly.  It's really an art people.    Best subs.   Really big subs, you can share, but you're not going to want to.  Best wings:  I've always maintained a wing should be fried, not baked.  They bake their wings here and they are the best wings I've ever had.  Their wing sauce is amazing... super garlicky with just enough kick.  Cons: I live outside of their delivery area.

The crust was toward the thin side, but crisp and good.   The bread sticks were definitely covered with olive oil and cheese. Some might think it was a bit greasy, but I was digging it.  Not sure, but I am guessing that the bulk of their business is delivery.   N*joy",

I ordered a chicken salad and have some food sensitivities so I asked the girl who took my order if the dressing had oregano in it. She said no, none of the dressings have oregano. I discovered my sensitivity through a blood test, and now if I have anything with oregano I experience dizziness and just feel out of sorts.  I ate the salad, which was fine...nothing spectacular, but it was a good salad. As I waited for my daughter to finish, I started to experience dizziness. I asked the cook if there was oregano on the chicken. She said yes, and there was oregano in the dressing as well. I told her that the cashier told me there wasn't, and her response was, \"Oh, she's new..she doesn't know.\" Another cook said to both me and the cashier, \"This is an Italian restaurant. There's oregano in everything.\" No apologies, no concern...nothing. Won't be going back.",

I ordered it for pick-up and it was ready when I got there, customer service was on point, they had the National Corn-Hole Championships on (well done management, well done) and the food was still hot when I got home.

    "text": "I'll be honest: I'm more than a bit of a snob.  When I'm in Phoenix, I hit two or three places for pizza, and that's about it: I'm very picky about what, in my opinion, constitutes good pizza and I don't stray far from it.  I'll occasionally explore other pizza places to see if they might make the cut, and it's rare that the list expands.  Stumpy's?  I honestly wouldn't have given it a second look, except my dad had a card good there for $20 and they're in our neighborhood (sorta).  When he mentioned doing dinner there, I pulled them up here on Yelp, and I was pleased by the ratings.  I have to admit that I am a little dubious of my dad's taste in restaurants.  And I was VERY dubious when I saw mention of their belt-fed pizza oven.  But there were so many positive reviews that I was willing to go for it, especially since my dad was buying dinner.  First impression: atmosphere.  There really isn't any.  It looks like a lunch place like a Subway, four-top tables and chairs, not a big place.  At least they weren't slide-in benches.  Small amount of indoor seating, but at 4:30 on a Monday it was more than enough.  Some outdoor seating, I think they do a good amount of business with deliver and pick up.  You place your order at the counter and I immediately saw what I wanted: the special #1: two slices of two item pizza and a soda.  I got a pepperoni and a Hawaiian.  And they were good.  My dad also got two slices, though I wasn't able to identify what abomination he got. ;-)  My wife got a cold meat lover's sub (cold), and my mom a hot Italian.  I also ordered a \"pizza crisp\", essentially a cheesy bread pizza, which was very good.  There were no complaints.  And aside from me, plenty of leftovers - I hadn't had lunch and pretty much inhaled my two slices, which hit the spot.  My two slices were quite good, though I wanted double pepperoni and didn't have as much on the delivered slices as I would have liked.  I have an automatic knee-jerk reaction, nay, hatred, to those belt-fed pizza ovens, but that's because there's this chain in the area where I live that leases the ovens and other apparatus for making alleged pizza that is an absolutely horrible example of what a pizza should be.  But here, that oven works.  Stumpy's pulls off very good thin crust pizza, so I won't argue with success.  It just so happens that I normally prefer thicker pizza, which requires a more traditional pizza oven for a longer bake time.  And a bonus for iced tea fans: three kinds!  A straight black tea, a green tea, and a blended black tea.  The latter two had some great flavors.  Still, when it comes to Stumpy's definitely recommended.  And when I'm back in Phoenix, good likelihood that I'll be returning for lunch some time.",

I got the special that comes with 2 slices and 2 toppings with a medium drink. I got bacon and pepperoni which was AMAZING. The pizza is so fresh and cripsy i could eat it everyday. I CRAVE this pizza all the time and im not really a pizza person. They have ranch which is extra but so worth it. Its more of a garlic ranch but not overpowering, but i love garlic so the hint of it doesnt bother me.  My mom got the special with a sub and a drink which she enjoyed. She likes her bread crispy but not burnt. They did that perfectly.   Sydney was amazing at answering our questions and had a great customer service atittude. She made our experience worth it. My mom is a hard person to please and can be very harsh when judging food or the customer service and she was even pleased with everything.  Its small inside with some seating outside, if you have a large group it wouldnt really work out. Its cute and homey inside with oldies playing.",

Good heat on anything Hot or better.  You cannot go wrong for take out here. Best in the neighborhood.",

The service has always been wonderful and they make a great pizza.  Our favorite happens to be the works: topped with fresh ingredients, sausage, onions, pepperoni, mushrooms.  Yum!  They know me by name, know what we like, and always have a great big smile for us when we come in to pick up our order (even though they deliver, I enjoy going in to see everyone).  UPDATE:  Stumpy's is still offering wonderful pizza and subs. They have added delivery within a certain area, but I still like to go to say hello and watch my pizza come out of the oven.  Fridays are busy, so don't be surprised if you have a bit of a wait, but it is well worth it, as they make everything from scratch.",

We had a B1G1 pizza so did a half & half for the first one (Medium 1/2 Hawaiian and other 1/2 canadian bacon and onions) and the other pizza, a small Philly Cheese Steak. The pizza toppings were plentiful for both pizzas and the crust was very good. It was enough food for the four of us with leftovers, too. On top of that, they make fresh baked giant chocolate chip cookies that I am still salivating over. Ugh, so good. This was a good local pizzeria that beats out the typical delivery spots. Speaking of delivery, apparently they do, too! I wonder if they make it down to 7th and Osborn????",

And as soon as I saw the pizzas on the tables around me, I knew that I had found something special.  Having phoned-in my pizza order for take-out, I stepped up to the register to pay and noticed a sign suggesting that I try a cannoli for dessert... Cannolis! Are you serious?! It's like someone took my favorite fattening foods (minus cheddar goldfish crackers & McDonalds fries) and crammed them into one easy-to-access location.  I'm sensing a lot more exercise in my future to offset the caloric intake (and yes, I did have them add a cannoli to my order)... anyway... back to the pizza!  It's probably good that I drive a stick-shift car because it was all that I could do to not grab a piece and start munching on my ride back home. After seeing all the other pizzas at the restaurant and imagining how they tasted, the smells permeating my car were like an intoxicating siren's call. After an extremely long, ten minute drive back to my house, I was finally able to open up the box that contained my treasure: a Greek pizza... Kalmata olives, banana peppers, red onion, artichoke hearts, feta & mozzarella cheeses piled on top of a crust that I would call just about perfect.",

I keep looking for decent pizza that is more accessible and less expensive. Read the reviews here and decided to try Stumpy's.  First disappointment - I ordered online for takeout and was charged roughly $2.50 extra for the privilege of ordering online. They ought to give discounts for that.  Second disappointment - the pizza. Ordered a large with ground sausage, mushrooms and black olives. We got home and discovered that we had a large with pepperoni, some mushrooms, and a few scattered molecules of sausage. No olives. We don't hate pepperoni, but we don't like it either and we didn't order it because we didn't want it. We tried to remove it but it was the bottom layer and they were VERY generous with the ingredient we didn't want. It literally appeared as if they took a pre-made pepperoni pizza and tossed a little mushroom and sausage on it rather than make the pizza we ordered. We love black olives, which was why we ordered them. Other than the fact that the crust was limp we can't say what the pizza is like - we could taste nothing but pepperoni, and we didn't like it.    Third disappointment - the salad.  It has it's good points - the lettuce was fresh, but it was all ribs, no leaves. It has things your usual side salad doesn't have - green peppers, mushroms, black olives - yeah, there were a lot of them in the salad, none on the pizza - but the salad would be improved by the addition of other standard items oddly missing at Stumpy's - carrot and red cabbage.  I doubt if we will try Stumpy's again, but if we do we won't order online, we won't leave without checking that we got the pizza we ordered rather than someone else's leftover pepperoni pizza, and we will skip the salad.",

When it did finally arrive, it was cold and we were missing about 1/3 of the items we ordered. I even pre-tipped them a 30% tip in the hopes that it would arrive a little quicker. Nope. I emailed GrubHub, they said they spoke with Stumpy's and the missing items were on their way. Well nothing ever showed up, the restaurant never refunded our money for the missing items and GrubHub shrugged it off with a \"we're sorry, here's $5 off your next order\" canned reply. That was a fraction of the value of the items we were shorted. This fly-by-night service is DOA in my book. I'll use other local delivery services going forward and steer clear of shady-Stumpy's. I cannot believe they would say they delivered items when they did not - TWICE!!! The whole experience was pathetic and disappointing.",

    "text": "I quite like their pizza.  This tiny little shop on Northern Avenue has a seating facility for approximately 16 people but they have quick turnover during lunchtime and the place is exceptionally well run for a small business.   When I went there I wasn't very adventurous with the toppings, just stuck to plain old pepperoni and mushroom. They prepared the pizza right in front of us, the service was quick and the huge slice was so hot that I could hardly hold it with my fingers. They seem to be making changes to and improving their business every week.  My colleagues and I are definitely going back to Stumpy's to try their subs and more.",

This time, was very different.  30 minutes past the suggested arrival time, still no pizza and wings.  I called and the employee I spoke with blamed the fact that I ordered online.  She said that the \"computer\" doesn't know how busy they are, she tried to say they are limited on drivers during the week. I quickly pointed out, that the orders I have placed have only been during the week.  She was not a good example of customer service.  The owner/manager is the only responsible party but he doesn't work past 5. So no one to talk to.  I was told that the food should be excellent.  This was the first time that the pizza was cold and the wings were soggy.  She got down to my level, and that was great.  She had some redemption there.  But I am concerned about a business that uses a \"service\" for their online orders, that does not know what is going on at the location.  I am not sure if I will give them another shot.  I feel really let down, compared to the past experiences.  I have ordered pizza from a competitor nearby for years, never had such a problem.  So who knows.  Stumpy's needs to take ownership, even if it is a third party doing their online service.",

    "text": "I love wings..prolly my favorite comfort food- wing pizza, a good idea in concept- extremely difficult to get right in execution.   I moved to the area about a year ago, and found Stumpy's on a hungry wednesday night. They have a pizza called the \"wingding\"- easy to glance over. But worth a second look. - This is NOT your typical wing pizza. From the bleu cheese base, to being able to add any of their house wing sauces- it's the most unique, and delicious \"Wing\" Pizza I have ever had.   At this point you might be thinking- ok great- or big deal- that does nothing for me, \"I'm not a wing person, so what?\"- Soooo.. This little pizza got me to try just about every pizza they make, their desserts, and their bread sides.    I've ordered online, (easy, though an account is needed), over the phone, through grubhub at one point, and have dropped by and picked things up quite a few times. Their service has always been exceptional and delivery on time (or early) and the delivery driver courteous. - when ordering for delivery everything, through them has been accurate (there was a confusion on garlic breadsticks once through grubhub)- whether that be online or over the phone.   4/5 for Excellent food, all around, and great consisted quality, both in service and food.  -1 star due to a somewhat clunky online ordering experience, and their crust compared to some, needs the toppings, to make it whole (not the tear it off and munch crust, or cheese and pepperoni pizza crust)- also somewhat pricey com paired to larger chains, no coupons for speciality pizzas that they give out- which would prolly make me come back for a lot more.   All in all, this is my favorite neighborhood pizza spot. Highly recommended!",

He's moved to the south end of Phoenix so it's no longer convenient to go to Stumpy's, but I crave it all the time and hope to go back soon.  Love their pizzas! The only pizza I've eaten from there that I didn't completely love was the Philly Cheese Steak pizza. An interesting idea that suffered a bit in reality, I thought. Their other pizzas are great though! If you're not in a pizza mood, their hot sandwiches are amazing as is their chicken salad. Definitely get it with the house dressing, this was the best chicken salad I've ever had!!  The guys that work there are very friendly and always remember the regulars and treat them like old friends. Check this place out if you're in the area, or make a special trip if you're not nearby. It's worth it!",

I was impressed with the online ordering as it was easy to order and allowed me to choose the time I wanted to take delivery of dinner.  It was 3 pm at the time of my order and I specified 5 pm for the delivery.  This would give them plenty of time to plan to get my order on time.  At 5:35 there was a knock at the door and it was the Stumpys delivery guy.  He handed us a few bags and brought out a pizza.  We ordered two large pizzas (a black olive and a ham and pineapple) and an order of 12 breadsticks.  We were given one ham and pineapple pizza, a salad and medium chicken wings.  I told the delivery guy that we had another pizza coming and we didn't order a salad or wings.  He said that he would be right back and left.  He was nice and apologized.  I think that he was new and just trying to figure things out.  I called the store and let them know.  They apologized and said that they would send out a whole new order and pick up what they dropped off.  I told them that wasn't necessary.  I just wanted my black olive pizza and breadsticks.  Frankly, the wings were stinking up the room and I wanted them gone but the kids were excited to get an unexpected treat.  The delivery guy came back with the black olive pizza and breadsticks.  All this by 4:55 pm.  So, they were still on time and the pizza and breadsticks were awesome!  I would definitely order from them again since they handled the mistake so well and their pizza was great!",

The pizza is great, has a thin crust which usually I don't go for, but the flavor of the dough, cheese, sauce and topping are primo.   It's always a hard choice whether to get a sub or pizza, but just recently me and coworker figured it out. We get both. We order a sub and ask them to split it and get the 2-slices combo deal and ask for that to be split, and add an extra drink. It comes out to about $22, and we both get the most satisfying meal we could as   The only con to this place is it is small so there is very limited seating.

Delicious pizza, and my son ordered a warm sub (which was amazing and a huge portion size). Not only was the food delicious- the service was also great! Everyone was EXTREMELY friendly and helpful- super casual and friendly vibe, and they were very patient with our questions about what size pizza to order for our kids  etc. The staff seemed genuinely happy and glad to be there, and glad to see us (the mark of good owners, in my experience). Thanks Stumpys- we will definitely stop back the next time we are in Phoenix!",

    "text": "Listen, the pizza is amazing. Pizza is my absolute favorite food, and this pizza is better than any other pizza I've had before (quote me on it, I'll stand by it). But the pizza isn't what makes this place, it's the people.   A sign on the wall calls it a neighborhood joint. I love that humble neighborhood vibe. The walls are decorated with cards sent to the company, drawings from Girl Scout groups, pictures of people I assume are regulars and/or locals. The vibe is off the charts. More than that, I was lucky enough to bear witness to an event that restored my faith in humanity.   A man had come into the joint, asking for a cup of water, as he was down on his luck, homeless as far as Phoenix is concerned, as his family is in West Virginia and he has no way to get there. He didn't ask for anything more than a drink, but one of the employees asked him about himself a bit to reveal this information. She asked him to sit outside for a minute. She made him a loaded sub sandwich and she and another employee pooled enough cash together to afford him a greyhound ticket back to West Virginia. I am so deeply touched by the amazing kindness the people at Stumpy's share with their community.   If you're in the area, please give this place and it's people some love.",

Their food is just ok. The husband and I got garlic sticks, pizza, and wings. We are in the restaurant, so we could see that they use a conveyor belt pizza oven and a microwave for a lot of their cooking. The pizza was ok, very greasy, but not terrible....just not a pizza I would go out of my way to get again. The wings were tasty and had a good tasting sauce. The best item was the garlic sticks....these things were crazy garlicky. Anyway, I may go back to Stumpy's if I were in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.",

We took a look at their menu and decided we would share a medium pizza. We ordered the butcher pizza which had all the meats on it. I must say that the pizza was GOOD! The crust could be a little thinner and a little more sauce could be added. Then it would have been a GREAT pizza. The Italian sausage was very good along with the rest of the meats actually. I heard about this place from a friend of ours. We had just purchased a house in the area and was told by him to give it a chance. I'm glad we did as it was only $21 dollars for the medium butcher and 2 medium drinks. We can't wait to try out their delivery service since we are only 5 blocks away. Thank you stumpy's for a great first experience at your establishment. Ws",

It's not comparable to Cibo or LGO but this is a different kind of pizza joint.

I called prior to coming to ensure they accepted Amex (which they did) even though it was a busy Friday night the woman that answered the phone was polite and pleasant. Once we arrived I order the family deal which is a large cheese pizza and 24 wings.. I added pepperoni to the entire pizza and bacon and sausage to half, my wings I wanted extra crispy and was kind of leery to even order them after seeing their wings were baked and not fried, total for everything was $33. My wings arrived just like I asked and the pizza was excellent. We opted to stay and eat in and the experience was pleasant, no rude employees or customers. So glad I listened to help on this one and this is definitely worth the drive and our new go to spot. I totally had every intention on talking pics but once the pizza came all my intentions went out the door lol.",

It's baked with the Mozzarella Cheese on it, and it melts all over the sandwich. Although, that makes the bread under the cheese kind of soggy which I didn't like, but the rest of it made up for this. Otherwise I'd have given Stumpy's 5 stars.  The meatballs were good and I could actually taste them. They don't douse the sub in marinara making it all soggy, which I also like. I barely finished my sub and I should have stopped eating it earlier but it was too good!  I was watching them make pizza in the back, and it looks like they make pizza slices to order. They even roll out the dough for each individual order. And like everyone else mentioned, they staff there was really polite and friendly. All said and done I spent $10, and felt like it was worth it. I'll be back, and next time I'll try their pizza.  UPDATED 5/22/12 - Had the meatball sub a 2nd time, and the bread was not soggy even with the extra cheese. I had a (3) slice of \"The Butcher\" pizza. Loved it. This place is extremely friendly, small, and good food. Updated from 4, to 5 stars.",

After looking at reviews we decided to give Stumpy's a try.    Let me tell you....the pizza is incredibly good.  It is what pizza used to be.  We had the classic pepperoni and cheese.  The sauce has that great tomato flavor with a little bite.  It is a thicker sauce and holds well to the pizza.  There is plenty of it too.  The cheese is a thick, stringy, melty goodness you don't find often.   The pepperoni had a great flavor and didn't cause the pizza to be greasy.  This pizza is really good.    We also got a couple chocolate chip cookies and they were the bomb!  I don't know that you can go wrong with this place.",

They also have some of the best rice crispies treat I've ever had. (I got a great insider tip that on the first Tuesday of the month, there's even chocolate rice crispies treats)  Awesome specials/combos, delicious iced tea options, quaint interior, and tasty fucking pizza.

'Sup with that????  Smoking deal on their lunch special.  If you're nearby and want a quick bite of tasty pizza, stop by.     They deliver to the 85020 area, which I work but don't live in, so when the family wants their pizza for dinner, as in tonight, I pick it up.    They now have a great online ordering tool, although it has always been easy to call in my order in the past.  And pay at the time of pickup.   We've had the Works, the Butcher, The Veggie, The Greek, and tonight will be trying the Whiteout for the first time.   Thus far all have been tasty. I've also had their wings which come in several different flavors and are good.   Their housemade ranch is available in a pint jar.  Get some.  My wife agrees it's some of the best out there.   Also, their large 16\"?  Well it's huge.  Prepare for SOME EATING!  And some leftovers :)   Oh, I almost forgot, they'll partially bake your pizzas if you want to finish them up at home!  If you've gotta do pickup and have a half hour drive like I do, they're gonna need to be reheated anyway, so just ask for the par-bake!     Great pizza from a great local joint!",

Stumpy's had an option for sliced sausage and it is FABULOUS. I will get it again for sure!! The Realtors in the area should mention proximity to Stumpy's as a selling point for houses!

The second time was sandwich delivery to Swizzle Inn and I was starved, so whatever sandwich I ordered was incredible.   This most recent Stumpy's adventure was pick up for my office. We decided on subs and, oddly enough, every single one of us ordered the hot Italian sub. All of us. You know why? Because we know how mf-ing delicious their Italian sub is. Someone suggested getting two different subs to try and split, but no one took the bait because WHY.  Pick up was quick and painless. My coworker ordered a side of the habanero mayo (they charge for side sauces of any sort). That stuff is spicier than we expected, so tread lightly.   In conclusion, why aren't you ordering your Italian sub right now?",

At an hour and 20 minutes we called to check status and they told us they weren't sure what was going on or where their driver was. They told us they would give a discount on the next order. The driver showed up at the two hour mark with our pizza. The pizza was okay, but would not order again because of the service.",

The place is small and no frills, but they are churning out some huge sandwiches with quality ingredients and some delicious looking pizza.  While $9.50 including tax, for a sub, drink and chips sounds a bit pricey, the sandwich can easily cover you for 2 meals.  While I waited for my to go order, the slices of pizza I saw coming out of the oven where huge!

I ended up getting a pastrami hot with provolone on Italian bread and it was so delicious. I know if they don't have pre made pizzas ready to go, they only have pies with sauce and then they put the toppings on as you order. The pizza oven is one of those conveyor belt type which I'm not crazy about. But the slices that were coming out for other customers looks pretty delicious. I'll have to come back and try to pizza you're going to have to be pretty damn good cause I'm spoiled when it comes to pizza. So if you're in the area, give something to try. Let me know how good the pizza is.",

Take out pizza always seems to prevail... lately. Being the foodies the way we are, we pick and order wisely. We peruse menus and almost treat this like a science experiment! Who do we turn to?? Yelp, of course! Stumpy's was this weeks choice for our pizza, as it's very near my loves office complex in North Phoenix. They have a great Italian and a great Pizza menu and salads too. You know, for that balance. We decided to order the Greek Salad , lots of Greek items like peppercini peppers, kalamata olives, green olives, feta cheese , sliced tomatoes and an amazing house dressing adorned the bed of lettuce. I kept dipping my pizza bones in it , it was so tasty! We ordered The Butcher as our 'to go' pizza. It is loaded with meats: pepperoni, salami, sausage, Canadian bacon and meatballs , ( although my 4 instead of 5 stars, is only because I didn't see the meatballs, and the sidenote on my note, I get that they aren't to be HUGE meatballs!.. but I saw none.At all!). We added mushrooms and this pie was almost pure perfection. The crust was good and crisp after we finished baking at home. Yes! Stumpy's is a rare pizza place that does a '3/4 bake' so that you can have fresh baked-ness at home! The crust had the perfect crisp and light garlic taste to it. We loved this pie and our salad, which was big enough to share generously! As far as our 'moving pizza addiction month' ... I guess that's what my workouts will be for next month! Should this move ever be over! Return factor.. completely a yes!",

Found Stumpy's on Yelp and couldn't resist the opportunity to eat at a place with such a name! Plus pizza is our favorite food group.   The space is not very big but they were quite busy while we were there. We ordered a pizza to split and grabbed a table. All the workers there were friendly and seemed to genuinely enjoy being there. Even late on a Friday night.   Everything smelled wonderful and we drooled over a couple of sandwiches we saw. Our pie came quickly and was just the right size for sharing. The crust was crispy with a chewy-ness - not quite a thin crust but not a thick crust either. The flavor of the sauce was good, not overly sweet or spicy, a happy medium. The amount of cheese and toppings was just right. It was not my favorite pizza pie of all time but  I do think it might be my new #2 for pizza in Phoenix!",

The chicken wings are good and juicy. I like the pizza dough and they make it not too thick, not too thin, just right. I hate all pizza crust, but my dog devoured it without a problem. Nice sauce, quality toppings  I find this a great choice for pizza and I hope hope their dishes are as good as the pizza, but I'll have yet to try them before I can review.",

The pizza dough is not too thick, not too thin, great consistency, and excellent taste.  The toppings are always fresh, tasty, and cooked to perfection.  The people/service is excellent.  The restaurant itself is very small inside, so we usually get our pizzas to go.  We have been getting our pizza at Stumpy's for 6 years now.  We love you -thank you!!!",

    "text": "Looking at all the great reviews I was excited to try Stumpy's. I don't know if we went on an off day or what but after our dinner, I can't join the accolades party.  My guy and I ordered a large pizza - half whiteout, half pepperoni and ricotta, and an order of breadsticks. We ordered pick up on a Saturday night and they quoted us 35 minutes.  We started with the breadsticks. They were okay. Lots of garlic and parmesan topping and they come with sauce for dipping. I guess I was just hoping for a softer breadstick. This was more like the pizza crust.   Next up was the pizza. The whiteout had huge chunks of ricotta. Some people might be into that but it was too much for me. Otherwise, I just thought it was kinda blah. The other half with the pepperoni was definitely better but again, nothing that really blew us away.  When we were done we both felt just kinda bloated and gross. I mean I realize I'm not eating salad here but it was too heavy and greasy for us. I don't think we'll be back.",

They are right down the road from our hotel (Hilton Pointe) and my husband went for pick-up after we came down with the crud on our last day there.   I had a single slice, and my husband and son devoured the rest of the pizza. One month later, my husband is STILL talking about that pizza. It is the sauce that is compared to all others. Even the local Italian joint suffers in comparison.   So if you want to get a pizza that you'll be talking about weeks, even months later, go to Stumpy's. I can't vouch for the service or even the other food, but the pizza will be once in a lifetime.",

I also recently tried the wing ding pizza. I'm not sure what a wing ding is but holy hell it's delicious! It's chicken and cheese with a buffalo like sauce. That's the best way I  can describe it. One of my favorite pizzas now.   And the service is always A+! It seems like it's mostly high school kids that work there but they are trained right and held to high standards. I have never had a bad experience here!",

Only the ambiance is a problem; it is crowded pizza joint decor and the tables are very close together. The prices are excellent given the quality. We do a Butcher's Special (meat lover) with added ricotta. It is as good a pizza as I've ever had. There is ample parking, but their few outdoor tables are on the sidewalk of that parking lot, so it's a mixed blessing. I usually have a side salad to make believe that I'm eating healthy. The ice tea is way better than most. We don't eat pizza often, but when we do, this is one of our favorite places. Highly recommend it.",
