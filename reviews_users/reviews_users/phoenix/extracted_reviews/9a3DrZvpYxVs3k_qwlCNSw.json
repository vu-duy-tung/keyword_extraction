My favorite pizza is the Tartufata - prosciutto, mushrooms, truffle oil, simply wonderful. Stop by for a unique and exquisite dining experience.",

Cibo is house that has been turned into a pizza restaurant, but they also serve other food. They are known for their pizza though. I didn't think their pizza was to die for, but it was quite good and a bit unique.  I actually asked for ranch (because ranch and pizza = awesome), and the server looked at me like I was stupid, so, keep that in mind. lol  The prices are fair, the atmosphere is awesome, and the live music was well done.   This is a good place to take your signification other on a date!",

I can't say enough about the pizza...the crust is perfect in texture and taste and the ingredients that top the pizza (including the ooey gooey cheese) are of the highest quality.  I highly recommend this traint (trendy AND quaint) Phoenix eatery.  You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Okay so Cibo's is really good, let's get that out of the way right up front.  Their salads with pine nut goodness, their sandwiches with the bread that holds up no matter the insides, the iced tea.  Oh good lord almighty that tea is great.  So yeah, after two lunches at Cibo with Jesse, I am definitely sold on the joint.  BUT that is not to say that Cibo is flawless.  Let us proceed...  Jesse was having a crazy busy day, and I was bored.  We decided to lunch early and headed over to Cibo, since Jesse had been craving it.  We arrive in the neighborhood north of Van Buren where the quaint little sandwich/pizza house is located, and immediately I note the line of cars up and down one street, along with the line of tractors ripping up the intersecting one.  There at the corner lies her beloved eatery, with many chin-up suits and aging re-debutantes making their way towards it from all directions.  Jesse, sensing the parking challenge that was soon to present itself, slammed the brakes.  \"Go get us a table.\"  I'm out of the car like a greased-up salamander out of a Mexican Coke bottle.   Scuttling across the street to get ahead of all the winners, I'm considering my seating preference.  It's a little warm out, but all the shade trees in Cibo's courtyard would fix that right up.  Then I remembered the close quarters the last time we sat outside, not to mention Jesse's disgust at being seated next to a table with *GASP* a child.  I didn't know what things were like inside, but it hardly mattered.  My mind was made up, and when the hostess showed me to our window table in the small dining room near the bar, I realized it didn't matter at all.  The whole place was close quarters, except now we were gonna be inside, which meant way better acoustics!  Full tables all around.  This place is way above the radar and has been for some time, so this was to be expected.  What I didn't expect was the high-haired doughy woman in the electric lime muumuu sitting directly in my line of vision.  She ultimately heightened my experience a great deal just by showing up, although I couldn't help wondering which tribal casino was calling all the hospitals, looking for their most loyal customer.  Jesse ended up ordering the caprese sandwich with added prosciutto (server was happy to oblige), and I had the BBQ pulled pork.  Jesse's sandwich was pretty good.  My sandwich was MAGNIFICENT.  The spice was a pleasant surprise, and also gave me a bit of good old-fashioned sweat-face.  I wasn't really feeling the couple of flies buzzing around us during our chewing time, but to be fair I didn't know who they belonged to, so I can't in good faith pin it completely on the establishment.  Also, the server seemed to forget we were there a couple of times, which is always fun.  But hey, I'm sure the Carries outside needed their lemon water refills real bad, having just played their freckle-tanned backs off in the breast cancer tennis match they just came from.  It may seem from my review that I didn't have the best time.  This absolutely IS NOT the case.  I don't think lunch at Cibo could have gone any better.  The cramped eating space, outspoken clientele, somewhat negligent wait staff, all these should be, well, kind of expected when partaking of a place like Cibo.  It's almost like dinner theater - get in, get settled and get ready for the show.  And whenever possible, watch for muumuus.",

I read up on Cibo in a recent Phoenix Magazine article and felt it was time to check it out and expand my pizza-horizons. My man and I drove down and were in love at first sight.  The atmosphere of this place is perfection. Right up my alley. The twinkly lights and warm patio was almost as cozy looking as the inside of the old home. A delicious pizza place in a quaint bungalow in downtown Phoenix? Yes please!   I love my wine almost as much as I love my pizza. So when I asked my server for a recommendation, she provided a sweet, flavorful glass of an Italian white wine. The wine combined with the Caprese Salad and a fresh Margherita pizza...I was in heaven. This will be a favorite of ours for quite some time to come. Thank you, Cibo!",

    "text": "It is axiomatic in Phoenix that the better the restaurant is, the worse the parking. The parking at Cibo is atrocious. Aside from the cutthroat street-side parking, there are something like six parking places in the back.   That being said, the food here is amazing. Cibo has two distinct menus: a lunchtime and dinnertime selection. Sandwiches are during lunch and Pizzas are dinner. Pizzas are not served here during lunchtime since the wood oven requires different temperatures for sandwiches. If you NEED a pizza, arrive in the evening.   This is not to say that the sandwiches are worth skipping. They are delicious. The bread is a perfect blend of crisp and soft. A lunchtime visit is definitely recommended.   However, the star of the show here is the pizza; their pizzas are amazing. There is JUST enough char from the wood ovens to give the dough that brittle crispness that is a sign of a great thin-crust pizza. Their ingredients are fresh and each bite gives a discernible taste for each ingredient in the pizza. It is not a mish-mash of grease and spice like so many other pizzas are.   For dessert, you must get their crepes. Their crepes make a perfect end to a wonderful meal.  The service here is extremely friendly and accommodating.   To give an idea of how good this place is, here is an anecdote. We went to Cibo in the middle of summer late in the afternoon. It was about 113 degrees Fahrenheit outside. When we arrived we found out that their air-conditioning was out.   We stayed anyway.",

It was a somewhat chilly night and we sat outside but I love the heaters nearby which is awesome because outside is the place where you should sit. It's romantic, pretty, cozy, just perfect whether you are on a date or out with friends. We started with the Arancini appetizer which is arborio rice with creamy mozzarella lightly fried & served with marinara. It was absolutely perfect! It was hard to decide between a pizza or a pasta since everything sounded so amazing but I was definitely in a Pizza mood and opted for the Genova which is pesto, mozzarella, potatoes, white onions and parmesan. It was really good but for me it got a little too greasy after the 3rd slice. This is just my personal opinion as I don't do well with foods that are greasy, however it's a really great pizza. I absolutely love their crust, that is definitely something I will be thinking about for some time. There are alot of pizza's I'd love to try in the future for sure. My friends had a pizza as well but I don't recall what they ordered because frankly, I was just having too good a time focused on conversation and possibly dessert. The service was good. They were pretty busy when we got there being a Saturday night and all, but when our server came over she was lovely. A mistake was made with our order but she took ownership and made it right. I love when someone does that! No one is perfect, but when you own up to something and make it seamlessly easy for the customer to be happy it means a lot! For dessert we had a Nutella crepe w/icecream & an order of Palline (small donut balls) NICE!!! We shared all of it, and the crepe was way better than I even expected. Definitely will visit Cibo again in the future.",

Hmm is this my first or second glass?  I don't typically eat ham but the prosciutto pizza had me stuffing my face and disappointed when it was gone.  Now what's really to die for at this restaurant is the fruit crepes.  They're HUGE and they don't skimp on the fruit or toppings. Nom Nom Nom Nom... polite burp.  Kiss kiss smotch from the girlfriend for taking her to a romantic spot for dinner.  Oh if the temperature is right sit outside, it's dimly lite with vegetation and hanging lights.  Not for the faint of heart in terms of $ but worth every penny you spend.",

Don't skip the bruschetta and go with a group. Why you ask, so you can order quite a few pizzas and get to taste a slice of each.  Besides, pizza and wine with a good group of friends on a beautiful night on the patio...that sounds awesome.  Oh there you go, that's what more your could want, Fantastic Friends.

    "text": "Sadly, I'm not impressed with Cibo other than the very pleasant, kid-friendly outdoor patio. It's been over six or seven years since I last dined here, and back then, I was never really impressed by the food, but, after like 100 people telling me over the years how awesome the pizza was, my family and decided to give it another try because I must be crazy if I'm the only one I know who did not love Cibo, right??   My opinion has not changed. The food was edible, some fresh-ish such as the mozzarella on the margarita pizza but it was not explosively so and frankly lacked any flavor at all (as compared to other fresh mozzarellas which can be incredibly delicious despite lacking much \"flavor\".... ) The prosciutto my four year old ordered as a side to his kids' pizza (hey, he's a foodie!) was sub par quality but he gobbled it! The sauces on the pizza and pasta were \"spaghetti'o\" tasting per my husband and I kind of agree. No fresh Parmesan... disappointing.   And overall, while it's a kid friendly setting, my husband an I both felt like our server was merely tolerating the existence of our two kids who were at her table. She was pleasant enough and was in no way rude or sub-par as far as her duties, but really didn't seem to be into having kids in her section. I get it, we're a pain, we're messy, we know it ... but we tip well and would prefer to feel like we didn't have to leave asap. The busser at the end of the meal was super cool with our kids, engaging, friendly and happy, so sad I didn't get his name to thank him.",

The atmosphere is difficult to beat; it's essentially a little old house with a huge front patio, complete with several outdoor tables, strings of those medium sized \"yellowish\" lights. Inside is so adorable, with a few different rooms with tables in each one. It is always clean and can be a great place for a date or get together with family or friends. So worth it. I've never bothered to wait to eat at Pizzeria Bianco, so I can't say from personal experience but I suspect they wouldn't be any better than this little gem, CIBO. From friends who've been to both, I'd say they'd agree!",

Got there and were struck by the gorgeous patio and cute interior. Had two salads (huge and and delicious) and 3 pizzas (2 gluten free and one regular).  Our friend ranked it as one of the best gluten free she ever had, and my wife said she couldn't decide which crust she preferred.  Can highly recommend the Salsiccia, capricciosa, and the tartufo. Truffle smell was to die for. Also an excellent choice of very good quality wines at reasonable prices. The Scarpetta Barbera was great.  It was chilly when we went but the beautiful patio was crowded with people and heaters. We will be back for the patio as soon as the weather warms up!  Our server was perfect - knowledgeable, efficient and really fun to banter with. She's been there 6 years and perfect for the job. Couldn't have been a better night!",

We ordered their margherita pizza and M&M. The margherita pizza was OK, nothing too special. It was also a little salty in my opinion.

The cheese is just enough. They have nailed what pizza should be. Even their gluten-free pizza is amazing. I could eat their pizza everyday. The hot olive oil is definitely a wonderful add to the pizza, just ask for it.  The atmosphere is quite refreshing. I very much prefer to sit outside, weather permitting. Especially having little children they can get a little rowdy inside and they echo. I also think the seating inside is a little tight. Especially with a larger group more than five. Which is why we really like the outside seating. Sometimes still a little close depending on where you are seated but less likely to notice the noise level on the group we always have.  The prices are very reasonable for the quality and size of the food. Two thumbs up.",

We got seated inside and they really set the mood... the lights were so dim I almost whipped out my phone's flashlight app to look at the menu.  We started with the pesto salad (mixed greens, pine nuts, tomatoes, roasted potatoes and parmesan cheese). I thought the salad was excellent. The potatoes were warm and paired with the cooler ingredients was really interesting (in a good way). The server brought out bread and our choice of olive oil. We chose a red chili flakes infused olive oil. This was nice and spicy had a good kick to it.  For our entree we shared the margherita pizza. Really good thin, slightly charred crust. Good classic pizza.   For dessert we split a nutella crepe with strawberries and bananas. I was in chocolate heaven!   Overall a great place for dinner... and they have complimentary valet parking!",

Everything we ordered was very good - there were 4 of us and we ordered a few things to share:   Pear salad - an arugula salad with balsamic, pears, honey, cheese, and toasted almonds - Very good, would definitely recommend!   Burrata - creamy mozzarella with a balsamic glaze served with prosciutto and toast  - so good but not enough toast in the cheese-to-bread ratio!   Vegetariana pizza - a pizza with mozzarella, artichokes, zucchini, roasted red peppers - comes with mushrooms but we asked for it without. This was good but the veggies are separated by section - so you only get one type of veggie on a slice of pizza, rather than having it mixed.   Prosciutto Crudo pizza - sauce, mozzarella, topped with prosciutto. Very tasty but the pizza is cut before the prosciutto is added to the pizza, so you have to recut it to avoid ending up with all the prosciutto on one piece.   Pizza is good - very thin crust and all the ingredients seem very fresh.   Service was pretty good - although they must have been training when we were there, they seemed to get the tables confused and kept attempting to drop off items we hadn't ordered. But normally the service is great. I'll definitely be back!",

A beautifully lit patio for dining, which we very much enjoyed this time of year!  I had the Procida pizze bianche...Mozzarella, prosciutto, Asian pears, arugula, and goat cheese.  Paired with a Pecorino white wine, it was a melody of flavors in my mouth!  I wish I could've eaten the whole thing in one sitting, but you get a lot for the money and I had to take half to go.  Why four stars and not five?  Service was not bad, but not impeccable either.  Parking isn't that great and it's a small place.  However, I don't know about you, but I go to a place for food and service...not available parking.  ;-)  I will definitely go back...especially because I didn't have room for dessert!  Maybe I'll start with that next time...",

    "text": "One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix! The ambience is lovely and magical. Indoor seating is nice if you want that homey downtown vibe, as it is located in an old house with fun creaky floors and warm mood lighting.   Outdoor seating is my personal favorite. I have always gone on weekend nights so there is sometimes live (but not overwhelming) music and quaint lights wrapped around the trees surrounding the tables.   And as though the ambience wasn't enough, oh my god the food! My favorite pizza the is the diavla (spell?) which is a spicy salami pizza, and it tastes like what dreams are made of... The crust is crispy and the ingredients taste fresh! And the dessert! I HIGHLY recommend ANY crepes. They don't mess around. Fluffly and not to sweet, and always a perfect compliment to the nutella or fruit or vanilla ice cream. Honestly, they could probably put a pork chop in one of their crepes, and it would still be fantastic. Hahaha.  Perfect date night or girls night out or a good \"show your parents from out of town an awesome place\" restaurant.   Only downside? The wait... But I can't say I don't understand why there is one, and believe me... It is WORTH the wait :)  UPDATE: We have since moved from Phoenix, but whenever I have friends that are visiting, Cibo is first on my list of recommendations. Also, whenever we are in town, we always try to hit it up. Also, I'm gluten free now, since this original review, and Cibo has GF pizza nowwww!! YES!!! And it's good! So, I STILL highly recommend (It's worth the wait).",

    "text": "Last night, I took my mother to Cibo for her first time. It was my third time. First of all, there is complimentary valet (which we did not use), but the parking lot is TINY. We ended up parking a bit away at the Salvation Army establishment. Once we walked to the entrance, we signed in (they send you a text message once your table is ready), and we were lucky enough to sit at the two chairs outside the front door. But please be aware; the waitresses carelessly kick the door open as they walk outside, and after we watched this happen over and over again, we decided it to be a danger. So if you have little ones, DO NOT let them wander by the front door. Her initial reaction to the loudness inside the restaurant was shock. Beware; the sound levels on a busy night are near-deafening. Also, the tables are situated very, very close to each other, so this is definitely not a good idea for a romantic dinner. We both ordered the pulled-pork sandwich made with fresh charbroiled buns. The pulled-pork was delicious and the buns were tough, but was okay, because we ate our sandwiches with a fork and knife. After dessert, we ordered crepes! I had the Nutella and Banana, and she had the Nutella and Mascarpone (fancy cheese). My crepe was excellent, and cost $7.50, which is worth it in my opinion. Her's cost $8.00 and was great, but she complained of not being able to taste the cheese. All in all, we enjoyed our food and dessert, and ultimately, recommend you try Cibo, and if at all costs possible, during a non-busy time of the day.",

Finally got a chance to check out Cibo tonight and man am I happy as a...well you get the rest.  Took wife and kids out for dinner before first friday.  I got this great glass or red called Valpolicello, which was AWESOME!  Wifey had a glass of Rose' that was legit.  We decided to have the pesto salad, Di Notte Pizza and Prosciutto Crudo. The salad was pretty good. I didn't taste much pesto, but it was still good. The crust on the pizza was something magic, seriously dope. The Prosciuto crudo was just like when I lived in Italy. Simple, straight forward and dope. Di Notte on the other hand literally tasted like buttered popcorn. No seriously, if you try it watch and see..not my fave. Overall the pizza was awesome, I'm stoked to try some of the other pies. They were busy but we managed to get an inside table right away, score!  If your looking for a legitamus prime pizza spot in cen-pho, you've found it.",

    "text": "Some of the last negative reviews are just plain whining.   I've been eating here for years and the food has NEVER disappointed. The service is always consistent and friendly. The owners Tony and his wife, along with their son - treat you like family. Many of the servers here have been here for years.  The restaurant is located in an old vintage house - so those complaining about the atmosphere or grounds are way off the mark as the antique and rustic feeling is part of the vibe.  Is the Pizza as good as Bianco? No.  Is the pizza outstanding? Yes - no question.  Those comparing this to Bianco again again ad nauseum are missing the point. The pizza here has an extremely flavorful thin crust, and the pies are made by a real pizzailo chef straight from Italy. The pizza is generally perfectly charred, with a nice depth of flavors. This pizza is very similar to the pizza you might get in any good restaurant in Italy.   So stop the whining and comparison to Bianco... sheesh! These are yummy pies any way you slice them, with some interesting twists like sweet aged Balsamic onions that my kids especially love.   The salads here also rock - especially the Pesto salad with small crispy potato bits. Yum!  When you come to Cibo you will be treated like family. Sitting outside among the beautiful mature trees and the cool lights at night makes for a wonderful evening out, and few restaurants in Phoenix can match the consistently great food and ambiance.   Desserts are outstanding, and the Nutella Crepe with vanilla ice cream is simply delicate and melts in your mouth - I like this one better than the Fresca (fresh fruit) crepe as it has a direct route to my sweet tooth.  So for the last few whiner Yelp reviwers...  I say go get yourself a pizza \"to go\" at Panne Bianco and pick up a Red Box movie... and just stay home!  They do not put Arugula on everything btw - goofy comments, what can you do lol.",

    "text": "First visit and I have to say, the food was outstanding and the ambiance was perfect.  I had heard good things about Cibo in the past so I was a bit confused by the less-than-stellar reviews showing up lately but decided to give it a chance anyway and I couldn't be happier I did. The evening's weather was beautiful so my date and I sat out on the patio. Twinkling string lights and lush plant life complimented by the trickling of a few water features really helped set the mood. Giving the patio almost a Naples feel to it.   We decided to order the caprese salad to split and a couple pizzas (one veggie, one mushroom) to share. First out came the salad and I was already impressed after the first bite. The tomatoes were sweet and juicy and the mozzarella tasted so fresh I swear I heard it moo. Next came the pizza. Now, understand, I consider myself a bit of a pizza snob so It takes a pretty good pie to impress me. That being said, Cibo impressed the hell out of me! The crust was airy and elastic with that perfect rustic baking taste. Again, the fresh mozzarella and ripe tomatoes made an appearance and with the addition of our toppings I was a happy man. I only wish I wasn't such a hog so I could have saved some for lunch the next day.   The only reason I couldn't give Cibo a five star rating was the service. Although our server was as nice and the food came out timely, there was a definite lack of attention. We were in a bit of A time crunch and I had to end up tracking her down to ask for the tab, then again to actually pay it. That being said, everyone has their off nights and the food was so delicious that I well be back many times.",

    "text": "Let me say right off the bat, the food here is phenomenal. The reasons I'm giving it such a poor review is everything I experienced this evening - outside of the food - was awful. They don't accept reservations which I think is a quack. Usually when a restaurant doesn't accept reservations, they have a bar area or a patio where you can sit, relax, and wait to be seated. Cibo has a bar - a tiny one - inside the home. There is almost no place to sit and wait to be seated for dinner. We arrived at about 7:30 and were told there would be an hour wait...I think it was closer to 75-80 minutes. As I was the oldest in my group with some health issues, I was the one chosen to get to sit in the one and only (metal) chair by the front entrance. I was thankful for that.  There was no wait staff who came by to see if we wanted anything to drink, so my friends and I waited the entire time, badly in need of refreshment.  We finally were seated on the patio about ten feet from a fellow with an electric keyboard. Call me old and cranky, but when I come to dine in a restaurant, I want to be able to talk in a low voice with my dining companions. Granted, we didn't have to yell to be heard with the music right next to us, but it was definitely hard to hear each other.   We did receive our menus after about five minutes, but I think it was another 30 minutes before we got our meals. The waitresses did keep our water glasses filled which was nice.  Our table was metal, sitting on a paver-type floor, and was uneven. My friend had to keep her foot on the bar of the table to keep it from wobbling. The table had cross bars on either side so you couldn't even sit dead-on to the table. I had to sit sideways and was very uncomfortable. The chairs were horrendous...plastic, skinny, and barely enough room to seat your behind. I think those chairs are there to encourage you to eat and run.  I loved our food...we had the Burrata, the Tricolore and the Tartufta (sp?) pizze which was extraordinary. We didn't get dessert as we were stuffed.  I would return to Cibo but only when they first open. I don't appreciate restaurants that don't take reservations and then expect you to stand the entire time until you can be seated.",

I am going to start with the dessert menu.  Really - every dessert is served with Nutella?  There wasn't one faux authentic Italian dessert on the menu.  Coffee - regular coffee that was exactly like the coffee I had in a hospital cafeteria.  I asked if they had cream for the coffee and I was told \"Yes, we have half/half.\"  It was liquid Coffee Mate? Uh, that is not half/half.  While I wait let me give you \"our cold stale bread\" served without anything not even butter.  We had the Latina pizza and the tomato on the pizza was not even ripe nor near the color red and it was cold dropped on the pizza like a wet noodle.  I bit into a piece of rosemary and felt like I was immersed in a Vicks Vaporub mozzarella pizza.  If this place is owned by a native Italian he/she would be the laughing stock of his former Italian neighborhood.    Hang on... I didn't taste any of the wine.  You might be redeemed with a decent selection of Chianti but I can't imagine this is possible.    Wait wait wait.... the actual restaurant is very quaint in appearance.",

And Cibo has a much larger pizza selection- which doesn't make that necessarily better or worse. They just do.   The one and only thing that I don't love about this place- their beer selection is lacking. I would love to see them Offer more beers. As a local restaurant, Why not offer some Local brewery stuff - 4 peaks, SanTan?  if you're into wine- their wine selection is extensive!  I'm just not a big wine drinker when I go out to eat.",

This is a cool Romantic setting type of place, but last time we brought out 1 year old and it is family friendly too.  We just wish it was closer!  We live in Gilbert so it is a bit of a drive, but WELL worth it.  The crepe Suzette is amazing if you like marmalade.",

Since this is an old bungalow that has been made into an eatery, this place is smack dab if the middle of a residential neighborhood. Their menu consists of pizza, salads and sandwiches made on fine Italian bread with some awesome Italian meats and cheeses and fresh local ingredients. I love the meatball sandwich so much that I can't bring myself to order anything else. I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu. The service is friendly and the atmosphere homey. Their outdoor patio is really a pleasant place to enjoy lunch. I really need to come here for dinner or their new breakfast. Cibo is truly among the best that Phoenix has to offer.",

I did make reservations due to its popularity, but Sunday night at 7p wasn't busy for a table for 2 on the patio. When we arrived we were asked if we wanted indoor or patio seating. Definitely sit outside, esp if it's nice out. Enjoy the fresh air and the beautiful ambiance.   We decided to order the Sunday dinner special - lasagna, and the Diavola pizza - red sauce, mozz, spicy salami and definitely add the ricotta cheese for an extra $2.   I didn't care for the lasagna much since the insides had a lot of veggies (carrots and celery). Yes it is different but I live my meats!   I did enjoy the pizza very much. I added more chili flakes for an added spice. The spicy salami had a good kick and the added cheese made the pizza really creamy. Delicious. Unfortunately, the crust was soggy with all our toppings. I would have preferred a crunchier crust.  Our service was great and we got good recommendations from our server. Cute \"house\"/restaurant with lots of charm and character. Busy on Sunday night and good home cooked food.  Street parking, but be mindful of the meters and red fire lanes!",

There were a lot of leaves being blown onto the table, but it's a worthy tradeoff for getting some shade.  The service was great; they were generally unintrusive, but were available to bring new water jugs and clear plates in a timely fashion. I also really loved the fact that our waitress announced loudly when she passed out the checks that the gratuity was already included. I would've expected that with a group as big as ours (14 people), but it was nice to have it be declared and not assumed.  I ordered the contadino with a side house salad. The cheese on the salad was 10/10, and it was light on the dressing, which I appreciated. The sandwich had amaaaaaazing flavors (man, do I love egg), but it was a bit heavier than I had expected, which made it impossible to finish.",

I was VERY disappointed on Saturday night when we brought our out of town friends to Cibo. It was around 8pm and we had a party of 6, totally understand a wait with a larger party- they quoted us 45 minutes. I was a little thrown off because the night was settling down and there were multiple open tables. I have worked in the restaurant industry, so I know how it goes. When I asked if they were under staffed, the hostess snapped with some major attitude- totally uncalled for. When I asked to speak with a manager, her response was \"he's over there, you can go talk to him\" instead of having him coming to us. I am not sure if she was having an off night or what the situation was, but I did not appreciate the bad attitude. It was embarrassing since we had talked Cibo up ALL day to our visitors and we were looking forward to the always amazing meal.   We ended up going to another pizza restaurant in Phoenix because the hostess made us feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome.   I will definitely give Cibo another try and not let this hostess ruin my view on this restaurant.",

However, having had it so many times before, this was a fluke.  The Rustica is phenomenal as well as the Salsiccia, Diavola, and my favorite... the prosciutto crudo.   The best part of the meal on any given night is, of course, the Nutella and strawberry filled crepes. I always have the gluten free crepes and nobody has ever been able to tell the different. The crepes are warm, soft, fluffy, and somehow hold up again getting soggy for longer than expected!!   The restaurant is a converted house which is adorable and cute. However, this makes for a LOUD experience.  Everything is wood and the acoustics around bad. It's loud and hard to hear across the table.",

The Jolly Diners rated Cibo at a 4 out of 5. For couples, Cibo had a great outdoor dining area with live music.",

Flavors were perfectly combined and the crust was thin but not floppy. Took another 20 minutes to close out the check...  Patio was beautiful though!",

Cibo is a restaurant set inside of an early 20th century bungalow with beautiful hardwood floors and exposed brick. When you walk through the main doors, you are greeted by the hostess stand and a small quaint bar... there are several dining \"areas\" throughout the restaurant, as this was a \"house\" that has been renovated in the historic Filmore area just off the main downtown area of Phoenix.    The pizza here is fantastic.  People often compare this pizza to another popular pizza restaurant in Phoenix.  I don't think that there is a comparison.  Cibo is so much better.  I have tried several pizzas here, but my favorite, surprisingly, is the Genova.  I always order the pizza well done and the crust comes out nice and crisp.  I love the Pear Salad as well.  The salad is huge and can be share between 2 friends.  You must also try the lemoncello.  It is divine and the best in Phoenix that I've tried other than homemade.    Bon Appetite!",

I have only gotten pizza here and that is because I can't justify getting something else because the pizza is so good. One pizza is large enough to split between two people with an appetizer or some bread.   Highly recommended.",

    "text": "I love Cibo. I'm not fond of pizza and I don't like long Yelp reviews, but I've got to preface this with a ten-second backstory so you'll understand why I was there in the first place. I'll make it fast:   Amanda M is one of my favorite Austin Yelpers, who has since transplanted to London. A couple of weeks ago she sent me a totally random text: \"I accidentally deleted all my pictures of a wonderful restaurant Andi & I went to in Phoenix, and I just want you to sympathize with me.\" Well okay then, I can do that. I feel your loss, been there, done that. Incidentally, Andi is Amanda's fiance and a cool guy.   So here's how Karma works: Two weeks later I find myself in Phoenix, I have to eat somewhere, and I start thinking just because I'm a cool & sensitive guy, wouldn't it be fitting if I went to that restaurant and made a surprise photo montage for Amanda? Of course it would. That's what makes me a cool & sensitive guy.   But what caught me by surprise is Cibo really is a remarkable place. It appears to be a converted house, and the outside patio/garden/dining area strewn with tiny lights is truly a wonderful place to be. On any given evening, it's easy to see why Cibo is a popular Phoenix destination.   And it's also the best pizza I've ever had in a restaurant. I got a half Vegetariana and half Diavola, because Amanda said their spicy salami was really, really good. And she's correct. Perfect crust, perfect toppings. I'm pretty sure their cheese isn't coming from a can. The house salad and Nutella & strawberry crepe were just bonuses, and superb ones at that.  I wish I could be a little more specific on what made Cibo - and everything about the place - a wonderful and memorable experience for me. The quality of ingredients? The magical ambiance? The precise yet transparent service? Maybe it's as simple as completing my mission - I knew what Amanda's montage would look like before I even pieced the pictures together. And I posted it for you here.   You know that classic storybook rhetoric about the planets lining up correctly, and then everything falls into place in perfect harmony? Well, that's pretty much how I felt walking into Cibo, and that's exactly how I felt walking out. I'm not sure it gets much better than that. In proper Yelpspeak, that makes Cibo as good as it gets.",

You just can't go wrong on that menu. Portions are generous but not absurd and service was great; friendly, thoughtful - eager, even.

I get nervous going out to trendy places because I'm scared of getting dirty looks from rich people, but this was not my experience at Cibo.

    "text": "I had been here before and the food was pretty good, patio is amazing and they have gluten free pizza (someone in my party has an intolerance), so I decided to take my family here for dinner. There were six of us and when the first two arrived, they were told they would not be seated until our entire party arrived. This seemed a bit strange, and I felt bad, as I had told them to order drinks and an appetizer while they waited for us. Not the end of the world, though. When the rest of us arrived and went to the host, I asked if we could please be seated on the patio, he looked at me as though I insulted his mother, and in a curt, very rude tone (with a facial expression to match) said \"No, you can't\". Then he said that they were booked due to a concert (there were several empty tables on the patio) that he was sure I was going to. When I said I wasn't going to any concert he just rolled his eyes and turned away, handed some menus to an embarrassed looking waitress and we followed her to our table. We were all in shock at how rude this guy was. I can't stress the shock. I have never, ever, ever had any employee at any restaurant I have ever been to be this rude. I was not upset about the patio (maybe a little disappointed, because it is very nice), I was just blown away that this guy had been this rude with absolutely no provocation. We only took a few minutes to talk it over and everyone agreed to leave, and everyone was in as much disbelief as I was. Before leaving I asked the waitress who the rude man was and she responded \"Michael, the manager.\" What!!!! The manager?!! When I asked how that guy ended up in a managerial position there, she explained that it's a \"family business\". Wow. My advice to that family is to hire somebody who actually deserves and wants a job to run your restaurant. We ended up going to Bianco (about 2 miles away) and received amazing service and amazing food (I mean, AMAZING food). No gluten free pizza, but a delicious antipasto that met our gluten free needs quite nicely. I will NEVER go to Cibo again and I promise, I will tell everyone I know to avoid that place like the plague.",

    "text": "Cibo is actually a house that's been converted to a restaurant. There is seating and a small bar area inside, as well as outside patio seating in the front yard. The outdoor area has white lights strung up among the trees, very cute. This all makes for a wonderful atmosphere: charming during the day and romantic at night!   The service is also great. Our waiter was friendly, knowledgable about the menu and made some solid recommendations for us.  On to the food: The pizza is AMAZING! I think Cibo is way better than Pizzeria Bianco. The crust is thin, but it's still doughy and a little chewy. We ordered the Salciccia (tomato sauce, sausage and cheese) and the De Notte (4 cheeses, spicy salame, no sauce). The sausage tastes like it has rosemary in it and the salame is indeed quite spicy.   Delicious!",

So we decided to give Cibo a shot.  Great choice.  They sat us on their beautiful patio immediately and they had live music.  James was our server and he was wonderful.  We started with the Il Tagliere and the 3 pairs of Bruschetta, amazing.  Then I think for our party of 6, we got 7 pizza's, they were all delicisous. I think everyone's favorite was the Procida, it was light and fresh and simply amazing.  I would come back here again anytime.",

The interior can get a bit cramped, but the outdoor seating is lovely with a gardeny-feeling and twinkle lights.  Each time we've gone, we've gotten the burrata and it's FANTASTIC. I highly recommend it to all the cheese lovers out there! We've also gotten several different pizzas (all of which are excellent) and the Tartugata and the Genova are particular favorites for us. The pizzas are a bit small, so we usually get a few appetizers or a pasta to go with our pizza. The price for the quality of food that you get is well worth it. Also, Happy Hour is a great value - I got a (generous) glass of the house red wine for $4 and it was quite good.",

The entire restaurant has an intimate, homey feel - from its candle-lit outdoor garden seating, to its wooden porch entrance, cozy seating inside.  Visited to sample their handmade pastas (Tuesdays), gnocchi caprese-style with cherry tomatoes, fresh mozarella. Was impressed by their extensive, reasonable wine list with unexpected finds.

Di Notte is indeed spicy and balanced by the Gorgonzola while the sausage on the Salsiccia is springy in texture and the crust beneath a bit limp (if you like crispy, this isn't for you---it's up to personal preference). Enjoyed the ambiance of the house and outdoor garden. And the stiff froth on my cappuccino convinced me the barista knows his/her stuff. Great service, too! I'll be back.",

The good news is I had a class near this place so I went there for lunch finally. The bad news? It was just okay, talk about a big let down.   First, the good is the excellent atmosphere. The place is just beautiful and the setting is in a nice and quiet neighborhood that you never thought is Phoenix. Luckily the weather is gorgeous at this time of year and the servers were very nice. You just can't beat the atmosphere, it is a great place to take out of town guest to impress just make sure they don't expect the same from the food.   The food, Now to be fair, I do not know where all these wood buring or what I call rustic pizza craze is coming from. From grimaldis to lagrande orange to other places like these, their crust are just awful from my point of view. I use to live in Chicago and those were real crust that you can actually see and taste and feel the textures in your mouth from the buttery thick crust to the crispy and light thin crust. All I can ever feel are just the toppings, the crust is paper thin with no texture or taste. Please the outside crust don't count, who eats that with the ingredients huh? Well all I can say is that if it is thin crust, it should be nice and crispy, not barely able to hold up the pizza that you have to eat it with a fork.   I have to say their ingredients is top notch and the salami was excellent on the Davoda pizza. Else everything was alright, the sauce was good, but not the best I have had by far. Beside that there is nothing to judge off really in a pizza, crust, toppings and sauce really is all. It was average, but again, next time that  I have outside visitors from out of state, definitely taking them here to enjoy the atmosphere.",

The iced tea is delicious. The only drawback is the service - it seems to be either hit or miss here. I've had more misses than hits unfortunately!",

You feel like you are having dinner and your buddy's house with his folks preparing a meal. We showed up for a late lunch, no wait or crowd. Pizza was fabulous. Nice texture to the crust, a little floppy so using a fork isn't out of the question. My son had the crepe, which looked amazing and tasted just as good. I would imagine parking could be beastly during a rush, since you are in a neighborhood, so plan accordingly.",

Their pizza is some of the best I've had in the Valley- chewy, tender crust with that wood-fired taste and it's obvious that all of the toppings are high quality.   Luckily I came here on a night when they were serving up handmade pasta and got to try the Orecchiette Bolognese which was delicious all around, perfectly sauced, and came with a small side salad. The portion was a bit small which was a tad disappointing for the $14ish price.  We rounded up the meal with the Banana Nutella Crepe with Ice Cream...the perfectly sweet way to end the meal! Cibo has a gorgeous patio space and live music on some nights. It was a bit chilly but there were ample heaters to keep us comfortable during our meal.  The service was a bit spotty and our waitress wasn't very sincere and seemed rushed, which was a bit irritating, but the food made up for that and that's why Cibo gets 4 stars in my book.  Will definitely be returning!",

Carved into an old house, Cibo offers a stellar patio from October to March where giant trees studded with lights and providing a seductive canopy create a romantic or intimate setting (depending on who you are dining with).  Inside small two or four seat tables nestled into every nook and cranny of the adorable former house provide the same feeling as the outside but with a few dashes of warmth and cozy.  Now comes the food.  I feel in love with prosciutto at Cibo.  I rediscovered why I loved pepperoni here.  I remember each time I come just how perfect pizza can be.  I have had about 7 different pizzas here.  The one with arugula on top is delicious.  The one with just cheese (4 delectable kinds) and spicy salami is delicious.  The one with walnuts is delicious.  I could go on and on.  Perfect for a date. Perfect for an out of towner.  Perfect for a birthday.  Perfect for any occasion.",

However, as good as Cibo is, it isn't even in the same league as Bianco. With that said, Cibo still gets 4 stars from me because of the adorable converted house it occupies, the decent service, and pretty good pizzas. Not my favorite pizzas in the world, but they're not too pricey and they get the job done. I also enjoy their crepes for dessert and appetizers. Their beer and wine could use a little upgrading, and I stay far away from their limoncello (which is just too harsh when it should be velvety and smooth). I like to sit outside on beautiful Phoenix nights and soak in the smell of the desert, but only nights when there isn't any live music. And by live music, I mean the nights when second or third-rate Phoenix bands play half-assed cover songs in exchange for drinks from the bar...no thanks.  Good for special occasions, large groups, and for trying to impress your parents when they come to visit.",

Unfortunately, I can't give Cibo four or five stars becuase the service continues to be awful.  I was in the restaurant last Saturday night, it was busy and there seemed to be a complete melt down with the bar staff and the wait staff.  The Bar tender refused to serve us.  She sent us to a drab coach house in the back of the restaurant.  The Coach House did not have the full wine list available.  Really, there was not much available.  The bar tender kept dissapearing, he ran out of glasses, it was too crowded, noisy...I expect much more from a restaurant.  After we were finally seated, things improved.    I think I'll avoid Cibo on the weekends until it can work out its service issues.",

    "text": "Not really necessary to add to the compliments but why not if they deserve it. Food was phenomenal. Really. It was. Best pizza I had in a long time (ever?), and my husband shared that sentiment. Grilled veggie appetizer was very good too. Next day we went back (not our M.O. in a city where we only have 2 days) and got pizza and desert, crepes. Hmmm. Only complaint we had is the first day, the service was really rushed. Girl wanted to take our plate while there was still some olives on it, and when she brought us the check, while she was thanking us she was already turned away to the next table. A few extra seconds go a long way here, I'd say. Also, they \"switched out\"  some beers without telling us when we ordered, which I didn't like. Service next day was better and all in all, I'd very much recommend the place!",

When I called I asked if they do anything special for birthdays and they said they could bring out a dessert for him. I also asked if we could reserve a table outside, and they said no problem.   I called an hour before our reservation and was told everything was good to go. When we arrived, the waiter almost said \"everyone is seated back here\" and I kind of had to shush him, being that it was a big surprise for my bf... So he walked us to our table, which was inside even though we reserved an outside table.   Everything went well, the food was okay but no dessert was ever brought out. I wasn't too impressed with my first visit but I think I'd return for a casual dinner date or something.",

Service had always been pretty much par and the whole experience just kind of enjoyable. Then I saw the reviews on here (1200+ -- so why am I even bothering with mine?) and was really glad I hadn't Yelped Cibo first.  Look, the food is good and the atmosphere is inviting. Really, it's good. But it's a restaurant. It's got a small space and you are going to get the fallbacks that come with a popular and small place. Now, I know some people feel like they aren't going to a worthwhile establishment if they aren't waiting -- I disagree. But I will say this is -- if you are looking for a good dining experience, Cibo is there. If you're looking for the out of this world experience that some Yelpers have had, I can't provide a roadmap for that.",

Very nice outside patio/garden area but we opted to eat inside as they allowed smoking right outside the perimeter of the patio area. We had 3 out of our party of 6 who are gf by choice to myself, being very gluten sensitive & extremely sick when ingesting even small amounts of gluten. Most of us had pizza & were very satisfied. I had a gf Basil pesto pizza that had roasted potatoes on it. I wasn't a huge fan of the potatoes but they did not allow substitutions & did not have build your own option. It would have been amazing with some org. chicken breast on it & I did tell our waiter that.  The crust was amazing for a gf pizza crust, you would never have known it was gf if it didn't come out with a gf flag on each gf pizza. 5+ stars on the crust. One in our party had a calzone with sausage & the sausage was very spicy hot. She had to pick most of it out just too hot for her. Would have been good to warn those ordering sausage about that. One in our party had calamari as his entree & it was just okay, not great. Looked like french fries, different than any I have ever seen. Most of us got crepes for desert. They had a buckwheat gf version, which I got. They were all amazing! All in all a good meal with great service. We will def go back if ever in the phoenix area again.",

Not only are they a nice date place to go before a night out, but they also can accommodate our toddler with finger foods and friendly service.    Baby B loved his meatballs and chewy pizza crust, while momma had the Di Notti, and I had the Rustica because it has arugula on top which makes me feel I'm eating healthy.  The sparrows got a healthy dose of pizza crust too because B is a bit of a messy eater.   We always do the patio, and love sitting outside in this nice old Phoenix neighborhood.

With its grape tomatoes, pin nuts, red, peppers, onions and more with balsamic and mixed greens. For dessert we had the Crepes filled with marsclpon, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries, sprinkled with powdered sugar! So yummy. To top it all off we had a nice Cappuccino, so foamy and warm! I think I had already fallen in love the second we turned the corner and all you could see was this beautiful place draped with lights and vines. As you walk up through the beautiful patio setting there were misters and a live band playing. Then the waitress took us through the little maze of what use to be a house to our cozy little table.

My one thing would be that because I try to steer clear of pork, maybe more chicken or fish plate options might be nice?",

From the unique atmosphere, to the awesome servers, to the food that makes you moan in a \"sweet-mother-of-pearl-this-is-insane\" way, Cibo's is a MUST. And this rarely happens to me, but I CRAVE Cibo's on a weekly basis. The pizza was to DIE for, but the prosciutto-mozzarella sandwich was by far the BEST thing I've eaten in years.   I love you, Cibo!",

    "text": "Being the pizza connoisseurs that we are, we decided to try Cibo a few weeks ago after reading some pretty stellar reviews on Yelp. As you can tell by now from the sheer amount of 4 and 5 star reviews, this place has got it going on like Donkey Kong (sorry).   In no particular order, here are some of my favorite things about Cibo:   1. It's right next door to Tammie Coe! We love us some red velvet cupcakes that Ms. Coe bakes up, so it's almost a little too perfect that two of our most favorite things in Phoenix are right across the street from each other!!   2. The pizza of course silly! Last time we tried three of their pizza's and they were all phenomenal. You could order cow dung and bird feathers on pizza and they would make it taste moist and delicious, that's how good they are! This pizza reminds me a lot of the pizza they serve at the almighty Pizzeria Bianco....and that's saying something.   3. Simon Crown! Who is Simon Crown you ask? Why, he's only the greatest keyboard player west of the Mississippi! Well, that might be a slight stretch, but he is a really cool black dude who plays catchy and happy melodies on weekends while you eat in the outdoor patio and wait to be seated. He even sells his CD there for $15, but he only accepts cash so make sure to bring some extra spending money next time you go to Cibo so you can support a unique local artist!   4. Great for people watching. Cibo was voted one of the best places to go on a first date in Phoenix, so you'll be sure to see lot's of awkwardness between couples of all ages. It could even turn into a fun game while you wait to be seated....like, who can be the first person to spot the couple on their first date?   Well, even if none of the aforementioned reasons for visiting Cibo strikes your fancy, you've just got to bite the bullet and try this place already! I promise you won't go home disappointed (unless you're a real jerk).",

Great place for a date night if that's what you're looking for. The only reason I rated this experience a 4 out of 5 is because of the time it took for the server to take our orders and bring our check.

    "text": "Let me add to the chorus of awesome.  This place sets the Neapolitan pizza standard in Phoenix (amidst quite a bit of competition).  Bianco, yeah yeah, it's good, if you've got the patience to wait and know well in advance that all the hype is more than just a wee overstated.  I've eaten at Cibo probably 50 times in the last 5 years and, without question, it is safe to say that it's better than Bianco.  Guido has established a standard of excellence and consistency with the pizzas that is beyond compare, really at any restaurant I've ever frequented.  And then you have ever-changing pastas and (in the winter) soups Tuesdays and Wednesdays?  Out of this world sandwiches, served only at lunch?  And have you HAD their breakfast?  It's all ridiculously excellent.  And stupid reasonably priced.    If you're in any way freaked out by the neighborhood, it says a lot more about you than it does about the 'hood.  Stay in Chandler, there's a Chili's there waiting for you, with lots of ranch dressing.  Enjoy!",

Wow, they seem to have expanded. Very nice atmosphere. Nice place to eat outside. It really wasn't pizza... More like a pocket pizza or almost a calzone. Regardless, they have a nice menu variety, reasonable wines, and the desserts look terrific (did not try). This place may move up to 5 stars after my next visit. The fact that I say \"next visit\" should tell you something. We really liked this place. Parking is in the street with high curbs. Watch for door scrapes unless you are driving a truck or an SUV.",

Between four of us (2 adults and 2 children), we split a salad and two pizzas. The salad was the pesto dressing house salad which had mixed greens, shaved parmesan cheese, nuts, and lord if I can't remember the rest. It was very good though. It was too bland for my husband but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The pizza was Di Napoli and the Crudo. The white pizza was super greasy and too heavy for me. The crudo was good but be warned that the salami was very spicy. I had a glass of rose which was okay. I tried to get the Cioccolotini but they were out so we split a Limoncello instead. I loved the location and that it was a historic home. That adds such character.",

The ambiance of both inside and outside is excellent & so is the food. At night Cibo serves pizza (and gnocchi pasta on most Tuesday nights, call first though to ask).  On weekdays they are open for lunch and serve amazing sandwiches, the bread is based off the pizza dough. But no pizza during the day.  We love the pizza! Our favorite is the sausage / \"Salsiccia\". The sausage itself is exceptional. It's a thinner pizza, but not a hard crispy bottom. The sauce is not one of those over-spiced sauces, it is mellow and very fresh. They have an excellent wine selection. My favorite right now is the Barbera (spelling?) that they carry.  Just like most places, if you are there with a few people, it's a better deal to just get a bottle.  Favorite salad, the Pear Salad.  Spinach leaves, light balsamic dressing, pears and pecorino cheese (kind of like a hard parmesan cheese). It's so good!  Also anitpasto plate is also great, but getting two appetizers might be much here.  They serve crepes for desert. If you have room, go for it. If you like desert crepes, and who doesn't, you won't be disappointed. The nutella / banana is our fav.  Excellent place to bring  a date.",

Wrought iron tables and chairs on a brick patio surrounded by green shrubs and birds a chirpin, it's got a relaxed type of vibe. Our server was cool, and did a good job of being attentive and getting out food out to us. We ordered the PLT and Salsiccia both with side house salads. The food came out a little under 10 min after we ordered! We were very impressed by that. The portion sizes were great, and I almost couldn't finish all of mine.

Mind you there were 12 of us but it wasn't busy at all. There were several empty tables. We asked for split checks and with an attitude she said she would split them. We all ordered pizza at the same time.   We ordered the margherita pizza and it was okay. I mean they really put a whole basil leaf on the pizza instead of shredding it or making it into smaller pieces on other slices. The crust is really thin and the cheese kept sliding off. They also don't have pepperoni which is odd for a pizza place.  Two people in our group still didn't receive their pizza as the majority of us were already done eating. They also got the same pizza and it came out 15 min later! The waitress never came out to check on us during our meal and took foreverrrr to bring our checks and bring our cards back after we paid. Also, our waters were empty during our meal and the lady who brought the last pizza out filled it since our server was no where to be found. Needless to say with the poor service and just okay pizza we will not be returning. I'd rather go to Fired Pie for the same type of pizza for cheaper.",

From the caesar salad to the pizza to the gnocchi or the charcuterie board or... pulled pork sandwich or sausage sandwich or even the oil truffle fries, it all deserved a five star in execution!  Most of the staff was outstanding! Unfortunately our waitress Amanda was mediocre, made us feel unwelcome and made us wait for everything we ordered.   Never mind her, we loved experiencing Cibo especially on our daughter's graduation, she earned her Master's degree in Literacy from ASU today , woot woot!",

I ordered the Salsiccia Con Patate and was pleasantly surprised! I've never had potatoes on my pizza but now I wouldn't have it any other way.   They have a cute little barn looking section that is separate from the restaurant for private parties at a very reasonable rate! We almost had our wedding dinner party here as I was looking for the rustic look, but we decided to have a destination wedding instead. The private section has its own mini bar area, lots of seating, a bathroom and it's own backyard section which was my favorite! Cute string lights and a perfect ambience for live soft music.   Side note: service is always outstanding!  I will definitely be taking my hubby here soon and will find an excuse to throw a party here :)",

The service by Tommy (not to be confused with the amazing musician Tommy Connell) the server at Cibo is lacking table service. Has been asked several times for beverages.  Also disappears before we can order.  I had to have another server come take our order. Very sad that each time I come the service has been underwhelming.   Previous review below.    I went  to see a local musician named Tommy Connell last Sunday. The patio was lovely. Dimly lit with white lights and large trees. Thankfully we could still use the heaters as it was also cold out from the rain earlier that day. Tommy played a variety of classics and some originals on his Gretsch guitar. What an incredible sound and way to wind down after an intense weekend. He is a musical wizard as his fingers make their way across the strings. During his break he came over and chatted with my group. What a class act, a very humble man. A friend of mine mentioned later that he also won best jazz guitar for the Phoenix New Times. That is a award he certainly deserves.   As per the restaurant itself. The food was delicious with large portions. The service started out very disorganised and quite unprofessional until about an hour in another girl took over and things ran smoothly.  I will be back though to see Tommy play again and will being a new group of friends each time. He is worth it!",

    "text": "The food at Cibo is amazing. The artisanal pizza is made to order and very fresh. It tastes great. When you think of Phoenix, pizza isn't really what you think of, but Cibo really puts it's stamp on our valley.  The food and plates are very picturesque and when using an iPhone in Portrait mode, it really makes the picture pop! The pizza reminds me of a little pizzeria in Rome, Italy.   The atmosphere and space hinders on this restaurant getting a perfect 5  review in my book. It is not a great place to go for a quiet date night especially if you like eating inside with A/C. The tables and space is very tight and cramped. You're so close to other parties that you can hear and be apart of their entire conversation. When other diners are so loud it puts a damper on your date and meal, that it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and ringing in your ears.   I would definitely recommend eating outside if you want to enjoy a date night.   Overall I would give Cibo a 3 and revisit when it's cooler outside so we can enjoy our meal outside on the patio area.",

    "text": "This quaint restaurant is resemblant of a little house turned into a little Italy cafe. What failed for me was the cleanliness. All our dishes were dirty, when we asked for new, we continued to get dirty dishes, glasses, and silverware. Frustrating, because you automatically put off, before your food even arrives. (Hopefully this was an off day, and the dishwasher was broken?) giving them the  benefit of doubt here. Next was a trip to the bathroom to wash up, didn't help that it too was dirty and smelly. Hint, light a candle, put an air freshener, or plug in, it will go a long way! The waiter seemed like he just rose from bed, messy hair, and wearing old blue jeans and wrinkled shirt.  I'm giving them a three star, because the food really is great! I think you eat first with your eyes, so had this been a neat and tidy restaurant, starting off with clean dishes, and a more professionally dressed waiter, it definitely would of improved the rating.  We started with the bruschetta appetizer, really good! Grape tomatoes marinated in garlic, olive oil, and fresh basil, drizzled with balsamic, accompanied by grilled Baguette slices, and freshly made mozzarella. The pizza is wood fired, and simply Italian dressed with quality ingredients. The margherita was delicious, nice chew and char on the crust, and fresh cheese and basil! The Pasta Bolognese was great as well, homemade pasta, which is a must, makes all the difference and really sets this dish apart from others in the valley.   Conclusion; Cibo has so much going for it, in my opinion, it just needs to be executed better. The kitchen seems to know what their doing, everything else is failing. We go out for the full experience, to sit and enjoy our company, food and atmosphere. We don't want to worry about clean dishes, and dirty employees, that's your job! Get it right, because your food is really delicious, especially when served on clean dishes:)",

We met my parents and our seating was outside. The server (Katie) had a noticeable snarky attitude from the onset of our parties interactions. Katie was sparse with a touch of cavalier with her attitude and interactions (what more would you expect from a freaking server at Cibo) She did not bring us bread for the table originally. When compounding  the  waiting for our request for bread, the attitude, and my stupid expectations... I finally asked for the manager and no longer wanted to eat their. Katie did me one better and got the owner of Cibo himself (Michael K.) came to finally provide the service I was expecting. NOPE. Michael was obviously dismissive in tone and nature. He ignored the fact that his employee had sub-par service and leaned on the fact that he believed we got our bread in the ample amount of time. Extremely unprofessional behavior that cemented my decision to never come here again. Will not recommend.   Birthday wasn't ruined at all despite 'condescending Katie' and 'smug Michaels' efforts! My family walked 50 feet to The Vig and had a great meal with great service (check the Vig for my review on that experience)   DO NOT waste your time or money at Cibo. It 100% comes from the top down. So no fix in sight folks. Michael was in a powerful position as the owner to fix a situation and he made it clear he could care less about getting resolved.",

The patio seating was really charming and the twinkle lights were pretty. I went for dinner with friends but it would have been a nice place for a date as well.   But our service was less than stellar. Once we got our food, we had to flag people down to get any more attention. Someone took our empty water carafe and never brought more water. One of my friends got the margherita pizza which she described as \"ok\". My second friend got the  rustica pizza. She said that she wished she could taste something. I got the tartufata pizza. I liked all the toppings but it just didn't have much flavor. The pizza was also soggy in the middle. The slice just kind of flopped down as I picked it up and all the toppings fell off.   Worst of all, there were two stray cats wandering around the patio as we ate. It was so disgusting to feel them brush against my leg passing under my chair and under our table as we tried to enjoy our dinner. The staff didn't seem to care or attempt to keep them away from people; everyone simply walked past them. It just felt very unsanitary.  Maybe I came on an off night, but Cibo definitely did not live up to the hype.",

    "text": "Adorable, cozy atmosphere and amazing food. HOWEVER, we had a pretty poor experience with waitstaff. Everyone there last night was completely apathetic and seemingly unwelcoming. In situations like this, I try to give the benefit of the doubt that perhaps the place was busy and the people working are a little stressed out and worn thin. But that didn't seem to be the case at all. It was barely 5pm and there were virtually only a handful of patrons. We walked in without a hello or directions on how to be seated. Just a gentleman standing there waiting for us to finally ask where to go. Our waitress seemed to be overly involved and enthusiastic with a table that had a family, and yet my boyfriend and I sat there with barely any acknowledgement and sparse check in. When we spoke to her to order, she didn't really acknowledge anything we said she just kind of wrote it down and turned around and walked away when she was done. At the conclusion or our evening when the bill was paid, a stone faced young man came to our table to collect my boyfriend's plate, and though I was still eating, stayed standing there waiting until I was done and as he picked up my plate the second I finished, hastily let the fork drop down on the table in front of my face.... as we left a young woman who seemed to be the appointed hostess (was absent when we first came in) was now sitting there scrolling on her phone as we walked out, not lifting her head to even say goodbye or show acknowledgment of any kind. I feel like we were pleasant customers and truly loved the food, but unfortunately the general feeling when I left the restaurant was unsettling and an overall feeling of apathy by the people who worked there. Either the waitstaff didn't want to be there, they were young seasonal summer staff who couldn't care less, they were overly tired, or they didn't want to invest too much effort in a table that only seated 2. I'll give it some time before I ever return again if I actually do because the food was fantastic and the place was adorable; hopefully we might catch them on a better night.",

There's also a couch for you to sit while waiting! :)   At first I was slightly skeptical of ordering a pizza with no sauce, but I am so glad I tried it!! They have a wide variety of pizza to choose from and I wish I can try them all. Although, I wish there were more options for pasta...  Overall great experience, very good food, romantic and cute ambiance -- Would definitely come back again!",

However, it was 110 degrees in Phoenix but the inside is nice and cool.  The bar is cozy and it was refreshing to get a local brew from Oak Creek Sedona.  I think there was only 4 choices of pizzas on the menu, I chose the one with sausage and it was delicious.  The parking lot can fill up but there is lots of parking on the adjacent streets.  It was a relaxing stop with nice service from everyone there.",

My mom and I didn't need it to be romantic -- but it was still lovely.  We split the Linguine Cacio e Pepe.  The pasta was clearly VERY fresh, and each of the cheeses expressed themselves with distinct yet subtle flavors.  We also split a crepe with nutella and added bananas and whipped cream.  It was heaven in your mouth -- and they did not skimp on any ingredient.  Abundant banana slices, whipped cream (also fresh), and absolutely slathered with Nutella.  We loved Cibo!",

One slight issue: fried calamari starter - nicely breaded & fried however the calamari was cut into thick strips (not a fan), needed salt & thought the red pepper aioli didn't match. Drinks very nice. Sausage pizza was one of the best we've had...crust was delicious & only slightly charred, good mozzarella, simple tomato sauce & house made fennel sausage.

    "text": "My wife and I made our first visit ever on Wednesday, February 13th (2019). I am big on finding good service and restaurants with \"Yelp\" based on the star rating and the number of raters. Cibo looked outstanding with 4 1/2 stars and over 2000 raters. It doesn't get any better than that. I was so excited to take my wife there. We went for lunch at about 1pm. Our first shock was the neighborhood, it was a bit scary. Next was the parking ( why the city even issued a permit for this restaurant without sufficient parking, I don't know). I was told that on Friday/Saturday nights they had additional parking a block away. Parking is by valet however, I would not want my car parked a block away in this neighborhood, and the wait to get your car? My car was parked so close to the car next to it that I could not get in to get it our and had to have the valet get in and pull it forward.  We entered the restaurant and it was basically an old house that had been converted to a restaurant. Maybe it is the part where they sat us, but it was not romantic as advertised. It was very noisy and cramped, and there weren't even that many people in there.  Now, our waitress and the service or lack of.....It seemed like all the help was young kids wearing old levis jeans. The waitress came to take our order and wammo.....they were out of the wine that we ordered. We went through the wine list, both red and white and were told that they had NO sweet wines. (???? the names were odd and we couldn't tell). We finally ordered a wine that was a little sweet. We ordered a pizza and a salad as they advertised, gluten free, and every body raved about it on the Yelp site. WE FORGOT TO ORDER GLUTEN FREE WHEN WE ORDERED, and that was our fault. I have to say that the pizza was excellent and the bathroom I used was clean. Our salad and bread came, then the pizza. We were not given a separate plate so that we didn't have to put the pizza on the oily salad dish. We were give no serving spoon for the salad and when we asked for a serving spoon we were told that they had none, \"would two forks be ok\"? No butter was given with the bread, we had to ask. I am not done yet.....she forgot to bring our wine and 3/4 of the way through our meal we had to ask her if it was coming. She brought our wine a short time later with nothing even resembling an apology. Throughout our entire meal the waitress never returned to see if all was good or if we needed anything.  I must tell all who read this, that the menu does state that there is no pasta until after 5 pm. You also can't order a large regular pizza until after 5 pm. Be warned!!!! You will have to order from a \"LUNCH\" menu only.   I am going to have to trust that over 2000 people who rated this restaurant at 4 1/2 stars can't all be wrong, maybe we just hit them, and their \"B\" team of waiters on a bad day, My wife and I will not return and can hardly recommend this restaurant to anybody.  WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!",

On the way down there we launched the app and attempted to put in our group, but the app maxes out at 6 for this particular establishment, we put 6 and added a note.   When we arrived they were a bit shocked at our group size, but they took care of it. We waiting no more than 15 minutes and we're seated in a sort of guest house out back with 2 other large groups. It was great!   Now to the food. Sweet mother of all that is holy, the Diavola pizza was AMMMAAAZZZZINNNG!!!!!  We opted for Gluten Free crust and it was out of this world. One of the best pies I've ever had. Then we got crepes and they made he pizza look more humble...which I wouldn't have bet was possible.    This place is stellar! Staff is world class, food is other worldly and it's super cute and charming.  Stop reading, go eat.",

However, she didn't give us much in the way of promoting the food or guiding our decision. She didn't go over the specials or any of the dishes.  What We Liked: -Atmosphere: elegant without being pretentious, nice outdoor and indoor, simple decor, charming home converted to restaurant -Pizza: we enjoyed the pizza, thin crust with a nice wood-fire char.   What We Disliked: -The Gnocchi: although the texture was perfect to me (pillowy, soft, handmade), the flavor fell flat. I didn't feel it was special the way a good gnocchi dish is. It is also very small in portion. And although I do agree with the waitress that it was filling, part of enjoying a dish is the initial appearance, and the initial appearance was sad, served in a small cast iron skillet, and looked a bit \"cheap\" with a bread crumb crust. We confirmed it was actually the entree because first glance we thought it was an appetizer.  -Opted out of desert because we were underwhelmed by the food.  Overall, the service and food fell flat. Which I think is challenging to do with a cream gnocchi dish. I appreciate simple flavor and although  it was certainly rich, the dish just lacked too much in flavor.The pizza was good, however it is comparable to many other pizzerias in the Valley. I want to like this charming place, and I would come back and give it another try if someone else suggested it and wanted to check it out.",

    "text": "Holy mother of pizza. When I travelled to Phoenix on business and asked the Phoenix yelpers where to go, I was a little surprised so many people said Cibo. I was even more surprised when I saw how many reviews it had. Well, Phoenix, I understand now. I have seen the light. You have converted me to Ciboism.  It's. Phenomenal.  The location is in a neighborhood and it's obviously a converted house where the outdoor seating is actually on the front lawn with some nice lights in the trees. Very cool to sit outside on a cool night in Phoenix and enjoy great company and delicious food!  When I was looking at the menu I was so excited to see so many options for Pizza Biancha (white pizza!). I can't eat tomatoes so it was like a kid in a candy store for me. Once I saw the Di Notte I knew it had to be mine. A huge portion, wood fired pizza with fontina, pecorino, gorgonzola and mozzarella cheeses along with spicy salami. It was to die for. I enjoyed it at the table AND I enjoyed the leftovers. My co-workers even stole a slice each and couldn't stop ooo'ing and aah'ing over it.  One of my co-workers got a meatball sub which he swore up and down was as good as his authentic-from-Italy grandmother's. He said it might be sacriledge to say it, but it was True. My other co-worker had a half vegetarian and half ham and she said the whole thing was delicious.  For dessert, even though we were full, we couldn't pass up the opportunity to try the Nutella & Marscapone crepe. It was a warm crepe filled with nutella and marscapone cheese, covered in powdered sugar and drizzled with chocolate sauce, with a dollop of ice cream. It was sinfully delicious.  I completely agree that this might be the best pizza I've ever had!! Thank you Phoenix, and thank you Cibo!!",

We started with the calamari which was perfectly cripy and had the perfect amount of salt and bright lemon.   The funghi pizza with red sauce was to die for. The ultra thing crust is dangerously easy to chow down on. The white pizza with truffle oil was great too, but I'm personally not into truffle anything.   The ambiance is adorable and unique - a converted house to give a very homey and warm feeling. This is definitely on the short list of perfect date spots.",

I finally became tired of waiting in the line at Bianco's Pizza for hours on end, and wound up at this amazing pizza joint. It's a restored 1913 bungalow on the corner of 5th Avenue and Fillmore with outdoor seating in the cozy front yard; it even has a fireplace to relax if there happens to be a short dinner rush.   I have been coming here with friends for a few years now; it is consistently delectable artesian pizza. I believe the chef is from Naples. It is very close to most pizza joints in that region of Italy. Some of my favorites, in this order, are: the Rustica, Tricolore, and Capricciosa pizzas. The balsamic onions are great on some pizzas too for an additional charge.   Hands down, the best thing and reason for coming here, is the Burrata appetizer. Average meal is around $17-25, add a $30 bottle of wine and split costs with friends.  Mon : 11am - 2pm / 5pm - 9pm Tue - Thurs : 11am - 2pm / 5pm - 10pm Fri : 11am - 2pm / 5pm - 11pm Sat :11am - 11pm - pizzas all day  (brunch from 11am-2pm) Sun : 9am - 2pm",

We came after dusk so the lights were very pretty. We were seated in the more exposed outside area... There's another side right nearby that's more enclosed and looks much cozier.   We had a 1/2 Tartufata and Capricciosa. I wanted something familiar and tasty and that was hard to find. I chose tartufata because I like mushrooms and the prosciutto.   Um, the pizzas were barely ok. They weren't terrible, but nothing like the reviews suggested. It's thin crust, but was floppy. The only thing telling me the two diff pizzas apart was that one had olives. I THINK there was mushrooms but I didn't taste it. The pizzas, sauce and toppings, were one homogenous thing. I HATE that when it comes to pizza. It didn't come out cheese-bubbly and charred.   It's an expensive small pizza. It should taste better than Dominoes. I'm hoping it's a bad day because it tastes like soggy leftover pizza. No cheese stringing away after you bite it or anything. It was an even layer of firm sauce  and toppings.   The dessert was good. We had the fresca. The sliced peaches tasted it came from a can but the rest of the fruit was fresh and the ice cream and whipped cream was good.   One last note. It seems the server dresses in whatever they want and there are a lot of them so it's just a flurry of people walking around, all wearing regular clothing. Sometimes we didn't know if they worked there to flag them down. I went to Clever Koi recently and the staff there was so friendly and really knew their menu. The servers here were curt and disinterested. However the people cleaning up our plates after each course were prompt.   Pros: Ambience (though we were on the \"less nice\" side Dessert  Cons: Pizza  Service",

Too many things with the service were off which leads me to believe there is a serious issue with management.  Every member of staff was dressed in raggedy clothes and they didn't look very happy at all either. The majority of them were frowning... our waitress was nice and smiled a lot but looked stoned and reeked of bad b.o. (yes it's hot in AZ but try to prudently refresh yourself every hour or so if you know you're getting sweaty). We waited 10+ minutes to be greeted by her despite her coming to check on the tables right next to us. Her service through the night was very erratic and left a lot to be desired.  We ordered the lasagna as an appetizer and a Salsiccia pizza for dinner but the pizza came out first! Needless to say I was very irritated that a pre-made lasagna failed to make its way out of the kitchen before a pizza.  The pizza was barely above average. The fennel sausage and the mozzarella were good but the crust and sauce didn't prove to be anything memorable. There are far superior places in the valley including one just blocks away and even a nationwide brand of pizzerias so to not even beat out a large chain was very disappointing.  The lasagna offered nothing special and was quite worthless being ordered as an appetizer but arriving after the entree.  Bland food, low staff morale, and terrible service just made for a bad experience and with these many problems in one night I didn't even want to waste my time giving a manager feedback. I just wanted to run out as fast as possible.",

The place is beautiful no doubt, atmosphere is 4 star but as far as the pizza goes you can get higher quality and price at The Parlor. We also had the calamari which was too tough and over cooked. The Parlors calamari was perfect and juicy. Our servers were also not friendly despite us only saying thank you whenever they stopped by our table.

The crust was leopard spotted, perfect hydration for their oven, salted cornichone... Just perfect.  The sauce was excellent.  Not sweet, fresh, tangy, bomb.  Their mozzarella is milky goodness, and they throw the fresh bail on last after it's cooked. Magnifico!  People go around talking about their favorite pizza spots and it always boils down to some certain pizza configuration; however, a True pizza person must see through this fluff in order to see the True greatness.

We eventually found the valet behind the building but found a spot on the street at the same time so went with that.  The give you bread to share which was just ok. The pizzas were all overdone (the crust was burnt) otherwise it seemed like the crust would have been good. Also, some of the pizza toppings were poorly distributed. One had 2 slices with huge chunks of prosciutto but none on any of the other slices. Kind of annoying when you're splitting. The pizzas were all mediocre. I also found it irritating that they don't use those little elevated pizza holders. Our table was PACKED. It was hard to eat.  We split a bunch of desserts. I thought the tiramisu was ok but a little dense. If you hate Nutella you're pretty screwed on dessert because 80% of the dessert was heavily Nutella based. The strawberry and Nutella crepe was good, but the banana and Nutella not so much. It had way too much Nutella (which is saying a lot because I can eat Nutella by the spoonful). We also had the doughnut spheres (which were actually more like triangles... who cares but I thought it was weird that they called them spheres). They were not the best doughnut holes + dip that I've had.  The atmosphere was the high point - nice patio if a bit crowded and there was live music. I thought our service was not spectacular but sufficient.",

    "text": "Sigh. This place just isn't as good as I remember it from a couple years ago. I don't know if the quality has gone downhill or my tastes have changed, but it just wasn't the experience I was hoping for.   During my recent visit, I split the pesto salad and funghi pizza with my cousin. The bread brought out was ok, crusty but a little too chewy and cold. I appreciate having oil on the table to dip. The salad was good. I absolutely loved the roasted potatoes on top. Way better than traditional croutons. The dressing was ok; I thought it could use more of a garlic kick.  Overall, the pizza was just good. I remember it being excellent. The sauce was bad. Bland and a bit too bitter. Good quality cheese. Again, I needed more of a \"kick\" from the toppings. No strong earthy flavors from the mushrooms. Crust was by far the best part.  Service was slow and inattentive but friendly. Value was good since we only spent $22 for our items. I was very full the rest of the night and even had leftover pizza for my husband to sample.  If anyone wanted to go to Cibo before an event downtown, I wouldn't argue, but I certainly wouldn't drive into Phoenix just for the food.",

We were first greeted by the hostess, then shown to our table. Once we sat down, we waited for our server, who's first question was if we were ready to order. Not hello, not even his name. We place the order for a Margeritta pizza and the salsiccia. The Magueritta was oily, with few basil on top. The sauce tasted as if it were from a can. The Salsiccia was a different story, it was saucy, tangy from the tomatoes and a bit of smokiness from the sausage and the crust. Overall our favorite. What brought this to a 3 star would have to be the 5 flies hovering our table, the greasy table top and dirty wine list. Overall an average experience. Not worth the 20 minute drive.",

The charm of this place makes you feel like you are distant from reality. The dessert wine I ordered at the end was the icing on the cake!   However, on my next visit, I sat outside on the patio for brunch and it was not quite as great of an experience. The weather was great, but the sun was shining pretty bright so I am guessing that is why our server only came by to get our order, drop it off, and bring our tab. No refills, no feedback requested on the meal, nothing. She was a very sweet lady, she just didn't seem to want to serve our table. The food was just ok. Nothing exciting. And probably more disappointing since I had already been there once and had such an awesome experience.   Overall, I'm not sure if I would recommend it. I recommend the pizza, but I guess it is kind of hit or miss.",

This place is cute, nice atmosphere. Service was ok, we waited a while to be seated even though they were not busy. Took several minutes to get us menus. We ordered a white pizza and a margherita pizza. Both were OK only. I found the crust hard and dry. The desert menu had only nutella products...   The taste was blend for the most part. You could not taste quality or freshness out of the pizzas and appetizers we had. The taste was Americanized for sure.   The menu had a huge selection, kind of overwhelming. Nothing special about the food or the place, over priced actually. The pizza sauce tasted like a can product. We will not be coming back. We will keep POMO Pizzeria as our place for good pizza. To add, the place is a bit too dark. The live music outside was nice but we wish the guy had a better sound/voice so we could try to enjoy being there. The kids liked though. Other reviews that say this is a good place they never tried Pomo yet. Side note, this is NOTHING compared to Pizzaria Bianco or Pomo. You can compare Pomo and Pizzaria Bianco, not this place! This place was all looks and show, nothing else.",

Well, this year, Cibo is being awarded its most prestigious award to date.  And that is the Craig R's Favorite Dinner While Visiting Arizona Award   Cibo, which is located in a residential neighborhood in Phoenix, is actually an old restored 1913 bungalow. The inside of Cibo has hardwood floors, beautiful stained glass paneling, an all wood bar and a fireplace. Since it was such a warm, beautiful Phoenix evening, my fiance and I decided to dine in the front yard of Cibo, which is covered with tables, Christmas lights and a fire pit. Cibo also has local Jazz bands come in and play live music in the front yard, which gives Cibo a super relaxing and romantic vibe. In fact, this was one of the most romantic evenings my fiance and I have shared in a long time.   To start out the night we shared their famous Burrata appetizer, which tends to sell out every night. The Burrata consisted of fresh mozzarella topped with a balsamic glaze, black label prosciutto crudo and toasted bread. This app was extremely flavorful and fun to eat. I can see why it sells out almost every night. The mozzarella was really creamy and had an awesome sweet and tangy flavor because of the balsamic glaze. When you combine all the elements of this dish together you get this awesome little sandwich that is sweet, tangy and salty all at the same time.    Cibo is known for their homemade wood fire pizza's that they prepare with only locally grown organic produce and imported Italian products. Every pizza on their menu sounded amazing so my fiance and I each ordered a different one so we could share them. These are the pizza's we got:   Diavola- Tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy salami, and Italian sausage  Tartufata- Mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and truffle oil. I also added Italian sausage and ricotta cheese.    Both of these pizzas were phenomenal. They were both huge and cooked perfectly so the crust was thin and crispy, with slightly burnt edges. The spicy salami on the Diavola was actually really, really spicy. The tomato sauce on this pie was extremely flavorful too. The Tartufata  was really cheesy since it contained both mozzarella and ricotta cheese. The truffle oil and the white mushrooms that were on this pizza gave it such an amazing taste.   The service at Cibo was top notch. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive. Since we had never been there before she was very helpful in explaining their menu and giving us suggestions on what we should try and what some of their most popular dishes are. She also always made sure our drinks were always full and that we had everything we needed.  The prices at Cibo were good too. Their pizzas range anywhere from $12 to $15 dollars a piece, which is great considering how big and delicious they were.   Whether you live in Phoenix or just visiting like I was, if you're looking for a romantic place to take you significant other then look no further than Cibo.",

The tables are terribly close together- but cozy. We had brought two kids with us- not really kid menu friendly. No highchairs, boosters or anything of that nature. I wished I had known that prior to going- perhaps a note on the website regarding their inability to accommodate small children.  The waitress was not friendly at all- she seemed annoyed that there were kids with us and rolled her eyes at us a few times.  The pizza was good- but enjoyed the antipasto plate more than the pizza. The patio was nice, but it was closed because it was \"only 64 degrees\"-- shorts weather for us.  They seemed like they were trying to rush us out of there to turn the tables quickly-- or to get rid of the kids, I am not sure.   I would not go out of my way to visit again.",

Usually I give restaurants another chance if something went wrong the first time, but I am never, ever coming back here - that's how bad it was.",

Atmosphere is laid back and friendly. Pizza is light and airy with the perfect amount of seasonings. Dessert menu is very limited as they only serve crepes but they are delicious. I always get the banana, strawberry, and Nutella crepe.",

To be fair to the restaurant, the appetizers (especially the burrata) was fresh and of quality. Additionally, the dessert special (tiramisu) was above average - though a bit cream heavy. Atmosphere was probably the highlight, being tucked away in a cozy home with outdoor seating that would serve as a good date spot.",

    "text": "I read Cibo opened in 2009 so they must have been a little ahead of their time when they opened this quaint little italian pizza and sandwich restaurant in downtown Phoenix area.  This seems to be the trend in 2010+, find an old house or business and convert into a comfortable, home-style, eating experience.  The house concept was relaxing, in a old neighborhood of brick homes and full-grown shade trees and at the same time, seeing the downtown Phoenix landscape on the near horizon.  The Drinks: n/a Didn't feel like any drinks on this visit although the menu selection looked decent.  The Food: **** We started with the Pear Salad, organic spinach, pear, pecorino cheese, honey and toasted almonds.  Very refreshing, and probably could have stopped here.  The bread basket was a little weak.  Didn't feel bad not getting seconds,   where normally I would.  I had the Calzone.  Much bigger than I expected.  Good pizza dough/crust, smooth and not too spicy sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, prosciutto and salami.  I don't recall any other ingredients in the calzone like onions, bell peppers or mushrooms.  More of a creamy texture like folding up a slice of pizza and eating it.  Very good.  Kat had the bolognaise.  Again, good flavor in the meat sauce, homemade noodles and healthy portion.  The Dessert: ***** Mostly crepe menu items like Nutella and berries or moscapone and lemon zest with powered sugar.  Nice end to a good meal.  The Service: ** Our waitress was nice but the rest of the staff seemed a little \"tired\" and unexcited.  We intentionally left our water bottle on the edge of the table to see if they would offer to refill.  No such luck.  Super bowl week is just starting so they better step up their game.",

The pizza is very good and the spicy salami is the icing on the pie! Good crust, good cheese, good sauce. And I've never had bad service.  My one complaint is that the salads aren't all that - they're passable, but the salads at Forno 301 and even Grazie in Scottsdale are much better. If you improve on these, you'll have a really good thing going.  I always try to pass it up, but never can - the nutella and mascarpone crepe. DELICIOUS!

    "text": "It's taken me way too long to write about one of my all-time favorite restaurants in the Valley, Cibo. I love everything about it: the phenomenal pizza, the beautiful decor, the on-top-of-things servers and the charming neighborhood location -- it's a must-try, for sure!  Cibo is in a historic home-turned-restaurant, with the most gorgeous twinkly light-lit patio (there are misters, so you can even sit here during the summer.) The interior is just as cute, with a small bar overlooking the open kitchen churning out perfect wood-fired pizzas. There's also an area that overlooks the backyard garden, and the rest of the inside seating is quaint and cozy -- you'll most likely be sat close to another table, so prepare to get intimate.  The obvious menu draw here is the pizza, and they're pretty close to perfect. You can get pizzas for dinner (their lunch menu consists mostly of sandwiches and salads.)   A single pizza alone is a huge meal for one (though I can happily finish one myself and still manage to gobble up some dessert), so consider splitting an appetizer and sharing a pie. My favorite kind to get is a simple Margherita pizza with olives added ($12.50). The dough is always my favorite consistency -- thin and soft and with crispy edges. The fresh basil is amazing -- I love it!  Plan on having a crepe -- they're definitely a must-have if you go to Cibo. I love getting the Nutella and banana one and adding mascarpone and whipped cream to it, too ($10.50). Every bite is incredible, and it will have you coming back for more.  The atmosphere combined with the mouthwatering food solidifies Cibo as one of my go-to restaurants. It's truly a Valley gem, and I hope it stays open forever!",

My boyfriend had the Oak Creek Hefeweizen (one of our favorites) and I had a Pinot Grigio, which was the perfect choice for the warm summer night. I started with the house salad, which was delicious and fresh. Then, we got a pizza and a pasta to split. I had the pasta del giorno (whichever the pasta of the day was for Saturday) and we also got the La Noce pizza, which my boyfriend raved about (and wouldn't let me try because he enjoyed it himself so much!). Overall, it was a very enjoyable dining experience. The food was delicious and the servers were very friendly and helpful! We'll definitely be returning and I'll be joining my friends in recommending it.",

    "text": "Loved, loved, loved this place. There's something so rustic and romantic about it, with it's quaint cottage look and glowing string lights above their outside seating. I was visiting my old roommate in Arizona and she took me to this place for some authentic Italian eats, the usual catch up wine and dine.  It's a little nondescript as the street holds no other restaurants, but it adds to the homey vibe. We went for simple and grabbed the cacio e pepe (a dish of noodles with pepper and parmesan that allows the homemade pasta to shine) and the Tartufata pizza. The pizza was amazing with a woodfired crust, crispy prosciutto, and the light taste of truffle oil. Definitely get it if you're a fan of white pizzas. Altogether, I loved how classic the dishes were.  As for service, it was solid. Our water was always kept filled and they were really patient when we were struggling over what to order.  This is definitely a place with a really intimate feel and is a popular date spot, as we were surrounded by parties of two. However, don't let that deter you from grabbing a bite with old friends.  And finally, if you had any doubts like I did, it's pronounced CHEE-boh. You're welcome.",

On the night we went they had low jazz playing and then a live guitarist playing along with it and it make the song and entire mood so much better.

    "text": "My husband had been bugging me to check out Cibo for a while and strangely, I haven't been in much of a pizza or pasta mood of late so I had dismissed it every time he brought it up. His persistence eventually paid off clearly, cause we wound up at Cibo last weekend and I've been kicking myself since for not checking them out sooner. I usually have a list of go-to restaurants that I take any guests I have from out-of-town, and Cibo definitely made it on the list.  Getting to the restaurant at a little before prime dinner time, we were seated almost immediately. The patio was gorgeous but since we're still at the tail end of summer (yeah, I know, it's Arizona, when does summer really end), we opted to sit indoors. When it came to placing our orders, we consulted our waiter for his recommendations. I love that he legitimately had an opinion on the dishes, on top of telling us what the popular dishes were, and was able to give us a very layman's description of each dish, leaving me salivating just listening to it (internally, thankfully. I hope).  To get the best of both worlds, my husband and I ordered a pizza and pasta to share. Specifically, the Tartufata, which is one of their white sauce pizzas topped with mushrooms, prosciutto, and truffle oil - you really can't go wrong with that. As for the pasta, we had the Saturday pasta special (the name escapes me right now) but was our waiter's absolute favorite - that's when you know you have to try it. It was phenomenal. When my husband asked me to pick which I liked better, the pasta or pizza, I was at a loss. They were both amazing in their own right and in my mind, they were tied for first.  Will I be back, if it wasn't clear, hell yes. And as I mentioned before, with any out-of-town guests I may have in tow.",

There are a shocking amount of tables they managed to fit outside without it seeming too crowded, though the inside seating does get a tiny bit tight.  They've got a pretty hefty wine list, and I've never been disappointed by any that I've tried. I typically lean into the Italian red blends to go with my meal.   The boothang is gluten intolerant, and Cibo has the best gf crust we've ever found. I straight up love gluten, and even I'll admit that it's good. That being said, their normal pizza crust is damn near perfection. Fluffy and doughy, it's perfectly proportioned to the sauce and cheese and toppings. My personal favorite is the salsiccia, with mushrooms added. The tartufata is an excellent white pie, but I usually lean red sauce. The salsiccia sandwich during lunch is also amazing. I've never had their pasta, but it's definitely on my to-try list. Their salads are good but not necessary -- my advice is to forgo and just double down on your entree.   They also do a free Nutella crepe for your birthday! And I don't think they mention on the menu, but you can also get this gluten free. It's amazingly every bit as tasty as a normal crepe.   The perfect date night spot, I highly recommend everyone come check Cibo out.",

    "text": "Okay. I'm sure in 2005, Cibo was probably a ground-breaking culinary concept for Downtown Phoenix. But in 2018? Eh. Okay, I guess it still has its charms to a certain degree, especially if you're new to the area.  Although the ultra-trendy bungalow setup has now become somewhat of a hipster cliche in Central Phoenix, Cibo was there long before the downtown scene started picking up. Locals seem to flock here for their pizza and wine fixes. Based on the conversations I've overheard while eating, it's clear that Cibo not only serves as an ideal first-date place, but a somewhat secretive hideaway for middle-aged couples having mid-life marital affairs (I've witnessed both first-hand at nearby tables).  Unfortunately, if you strip the ambiance out of Cibo and just look at their food for what it is, I've found it to just be only slightly above average. Their pizza is your standard-fare wood-fired style that can range from \"good\" to \"just okay\" depending on the day. On the positive, I do like that Cibo has no problem with letting you order half-half pies. Most places will arrogantly scoff at the mere mention of the idea. In fact, they even let you combine a white pizza with a red one, which is very rare, but incredibly convenient given all of their different choices.  While I give Cibo credit for offering some interesting creations, is it really necessary to have 22 different pizzas (sans the calzones) on the menu? Oddly enough, despite all of these ridiculous options that give me anxiety at first glance, their best pizza is a traditional margherita. Their calzone, which is rather alarming at first due to its massive size, is also fine, but nothing that can't easily be obtained elsewhere.  I've found a lot of inconsistencies with Cibo's pasta to the point where I'll only order it if I'm up for taking a risk. After my girlfriend and I recently ordered a taglietelle that ended up being undercooked, I was reminded of why I can't bring myself to give Cibo anymore than three stars.  For desserts, their crepes are one of the few things that I feel they've got down to a science. You really can't go wrong with a Nutella-banana crepe with a scoop of ice cream thrown in.  Their canned sodas seem like kind of an odd choice, especially considering most pizzerias opt for the glass bottle selection. It seems rather ghetto in comparison to everything else on the menu. Not everyone drinks wine, you know?   I feel that Cibo is worth an occasional visit, especially if you're new to the city and not really familiar with the Phoenix restaurant scene. But in present-day, us dining veterans have become so spoiled with quality pizzerias and pasta joints that I feel Cibo is just kind of running on auto-pilot.",

    "text": "Cibo is my favorite restaurant in the valley for wonderful pizza and a relaxing night.   I definitely recommend coming here for dinner over brunch/lunch because they have a very limited menu for brunch/lunch(I'm talking only 2 or 3 pizza options as opposed to their 20 for dinner).  Inside seating is very cute and romantic but noisy. Outside seating is amazing at night and the live music on weekends makes it the perfect date night spot.     Tonight, we ordered the Tartufata and Linguine Cacio e Pepe. My fiance and I always order the tartufata because we love mushroom, anything truffle, and prosciutto. The pizza here is just amazing and even though the white pizza doesn't have sauce (we didn't know this even though we've eaten here like 5 times) it's still the most tasty pizza out there.  Maybe one day we will branch out to other pizzas but the tartufata is our guilty addiction and I don't think I'll ever be able to give it up.  Tonight was also our first time trying the pasta. The linguini cacio e pepe was a very mild but pleasant dish. It's mixed with butter, cheese, and pepper and while the flavor doesn't knock you out, it's still very good. Next time we'll try the bolognese.  Cibo is the perfect date night spot. The outside view is amazing with all of the twinkling lights and the live music makes everything more romantic.",

We didn't have to wait at all for our table and the table was ready for us! Love their set up at nights and the music band on weekends! The lighting make the yard so pretty! The restaurant was super busy that night and kitchen was backed up! We had to wait for our food for a while but with their great customer service and hospitality they offered 2 of our dishes to be on the house and our waiter apologized for the serving our dish later than expected so many times! I felt so bad because I could see how busy they were! It seemed like they have few big parties going on that night. But we enjoyed our food and the bottle of wine suggested from our waiter. And we will definitely go back aga",

    "text": "Finally I get a chance to wrote this review. And it really is with a heavy heart that I have to present Cibo with three stars. But in my opinion completely justified.   My girlfriend and I decided to go there this weekend and revisit our first date spot. We live in Gilbert and this is a bit out of the way but we decided why not. This is one of her favorite spots so we made the trek.   First and foremost I really don't understand why they would not take reservations unless it's a party of 6. We waited 45 mins to be seated.   Once inside we were seated at a tiny table that is within body odor smells of the person next to you. In other words you are very close to other tables.  We also had the unfortunate pleasure of being seated between a drunken whiny birthday celebration in front of ya and a cackling hyena behind us. If you can mentally visualize this you will realize that it creates a very loud atmosphere. I literally had to shout a few times across the table.   Now onto the pizza, what everyone comes here for. First I want to say that the Caprese salad is one of the best I have ever had. Anyways, we ordered the Tartuffata and Procida. The tartuffata came out with the crust and the bottom being burned. The Procida had some asian pear slices on it which were very tasteless. Furthermore when I grabbed the slice it seems soggy and wet the toppings all fell off. I was left with a soggy pizza slice.   Needless to say we left a little disappointed.",

I read a few reviews that they were slow, but we were greeted, served, and brought our check in the perfect sequence. Not rushed and not waiting around, so I'm not sure what happened to those reviewers.  I can't wait to go back to this place in the fall and sit on the patio!",

    "text": "We came to Cibo last evening, before heading over to the Herberger to see \"Man of La Mancha\", aka a takeoff of Cervantes' Don Quixote.   Cabo is located in a former dutch colonial residence on W Fillmore near The Vig.  It's a fun and inviting setup that can be both romantic and classy in a bohemian sort of way.  Got it?  We arrived around five-thirty and Cibo was busy, but not crowded. I would certainly recommend the Yelp App to determine what the wait time is if you arrive after seven. When we left two hours later, there was a dozen waiting to be seated.   We started off with some Italian Red wine, Rosso Poggione ($13) and a House Salad ($5). Both were tasty and complemented each other. For our Entrees, we chose the Fra Diablo pizza ($14), with a few dollops of ricotta (for two extra dollars) and the Pappardelle ($15) pasta with a Bolognese sauce.   Both were clearly different, but outstanding.  The pizza had a nice kick, but wasn't a fire breather and didn't overwhelm your taste buds. My favorite was the pasta. The Bolognese was meaty and had nice layer of flavor. See photos.   Our tab, ran us a reasonable $61 before gratuities and taxes. Our server Cubana was friendly and on top of things, even though she was simultaneously handling a table of sixteen. Nice.   After seventeen hundred Yelp Reviews, you can see and read why everyone loves Cibo. We do, too.   Enjoy!",

The inside may be a little noisier, but it's still charming and a great place to grab a bite.     Cibo is a one-stop restaurant that not only has great pizza, but also fantastic salads and desserts.   And cheap wine.  I'm partial to the margherita pizza with the fresh basil followed by a nutella and strawberry crepe.  That way, I can say I've had at least one serving of fruits and vegetables for the day.

I brought my now wife last Valentine's Day here and we showed up a little early before they opened and bottles and glasses that were left out from the night before. So we came back and there was a line, which isn't bad but we got sat right under the tree. We ordered a  salad that was had pear's as the main ingredient and there weren't many pears and dabs of honey. Just thought it was a little cheap.  Then the pizza, there wasn't much cheese on there and the ingredients seem to be again cheap. The dessert seemed to be the same way. Finally when the waitress brought our check and came back with the change she said she didn't have time to get us the change so we could add that into the tip. So she shorted us .40 some cents. I will try this place again given the reviews and telling my friends about my experience, will probably sit inside.",

Bartender recommended we each get a pizza as one was too small.  My friend is a social butterfly and makes friends with everyone else at the bar (fortunately) and we kinda decide we'll share each other's pizzas.  We each order a pizza.  Here's where things start going badly. 1. The pizzas are large enough to share between 2. 2. My friend's pizza (white pizza with some stuff and truffle oil).  WAY too much truffle oil as we can't taste anything else. 3. My pizza doesn't arrive.  A few minutes later I ask the bartender where my pizza is.  \"Should be out any minute\" 4. 10 minutes later - \"Should be out any minute\" 5. 15 minutes later - \"Uh, we are making it now\" - Note that all of these were at my request for an update, not proactive by the bartender.  Since we shared pizza amongst the bar, I don't want it anymore.  I tell the bartender to stop the order.  \"uh, ok, we won't charge you for it\".  No kidding!!  The other pizza's were good but not great.  I did have some spaghetti from one of the other bar mates and that was better than the pizza.  Maybe sitting at the bar was a mistake.  I wouldn't go back anyway.",

I dropped 2 stars because honestly the last two times I have been there the service was downright slllllloooooooowwwwwwww....I don't like putting minutes on the time that I was waiting because honestly (and let's be honest) you can pretty much bet that if you are thinking \"I was waiting 20 minutes for a glass of wine\" it was probably about 7 if that, however it felt like 45 minutes and that is considering that the ambiance was amazing and I had great company. Love the food, love the outdoor patio, but I probably could have made wine at my table faster.",

But since it was my birthday, my friend took me here for dinner...and when someone offers to take you out for your birthday, who says, \"hell no, I'm not eating that!\"  So I went.  Let me start with the ambiance of the place. The restaurant is actually a house, it looked very homey. We opted to sit outside in front because it was late evening and we saw they had misters...plus, the decorations outside looked so romantic and sweet. Definitely a good choice for a first date! Or ...the 100th date.   Now on to the food.  He ordered for us but I got to choose the dessert, and yes, I asked for it to come out FIRST.  It was a crepe filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit.  At first I said, \"damn, $12 for a crepe?\" Man, that was amazing.  And well worth more than $12.  We got two pizzas, they were about 8 inches around and it can probably feed a party of 2 (but since we had a huge crepe before, we had to take some pizza togo). My pizza had prosciutto topped with fresh, organic arugula. The crust was thin and very tasteful. I couldn't get enough of it. His pizza had salami, mushrooms, and mozzarella cheese. Also quite delectable.  Our waiter was very nice, he knew we were talkers so he left us alone to do so. After we were done eating, we wanted to get some coffee but it was 10:30pm on a Sunday night and no one was opened.  Again, our waiter came to the rescue and told us about a local coffee house down the street, about 5 minutes away.  We went there and it was amazing too!....but that's a different review.  :)  To say that I recommend Cibo would not express how I really feel about my experience there.  Let's just say, since that day, I've had dreams about my prosciutto topped with arugula pizza EVERY NIGHT!",

The dinner menu is more extensive and along the lines of what Italian food I like. They also serve cacio e pepe, which I've had difficulty finding outside of Rome. Overall, however, we enjoyed our meal and would consider going again if in the area again.",

After trying multiple different pizzas I have come to the conclusion they are amazing and when you can't decide which of two you want from the menu, they have no problem letting you do half and half which is great. They will even let you mix the sauce pizzas with the white pizzas.  However, it isn't just pizza that is outstanding here. They have some of the best menu items I have tried anywhere, generally speaking. One of the best being the most tasty cheese plate I've ever had.  My suggestion is that if you have not yet been here that you stop whatever you are doing and head there now - your stomach will thank you.",

Of course we chose to sit outside to not only enjoy the weather(rare in AZ since it is generally hot) but the scenery as well. I imagine it to be quite romantic had we gone at night. Nonetheless the food was great, we decided on half tartufata/capricciosa. The truffle oil in the tartufata was definitely an acquired taste because the smell of it was something else. I am by no means an expert on these types of oils but I thought it was interesting while the girlfriend thought it smelled, and not in the good way.   I would definitely come back to not only experience the atmosphere again, but perhaps try their other pies.",

Neither of us had been here before, but since it seems to be a popular joint, and we had an idea of what to expect.  The place is an old house turned restaurant, and its really well decorated.  Nothing over done, but done just right.  Our server was real a real cute guy, and he told us all about the menu.  If you want to get one pizza and do half and half, you can do that.  They also have a great wine and alcohol menu as well, and I wish I would have ordered something to go with my pizza.  I went with the dovita pizza, which came with cheese and salame.  Tasty!  My friend got a half and half pizza, but I can't remember which one.  Food was all around good, and service was awesome.

They offer the regular stuff, drinks and some appetizers but everything we tried was very good.  Cute place for dinner too. Their patio's decorated with lights so it has somehow a \"festive\" touch but it also makes a cute spot for a date. It's really loud, though and very crowded. We were seating outside but all the tables inside were taken too. If a place is that packed, it can't be bad, right? Give it a try. You'll understand why it has so many good reviews.",

The salad was good with cherry tomatoes and mozzarella.  The pizza were mediocre. They were very soggy in the middle while being slightly burnt on top. Lastly, the sandwiches were good, but the PLT was too salty.  This place is probably better for dinner.",

The BBQ pork melts in your mouth with warm fontina cheese. The bread is like pizza dough and is cooked in their brick oven. Its crispy, juicy, a little spicy, and so warm. I never write reviews on yelp but for this restaurant I had to. I can't wait to visit again and try the spek or Pastrami or really any of the saltimboccas.

    "text": "My sister has ranted about Cibo for weeks now, and how much she LOVES it. So needless to say I was excited to find out that one of our friends was having a group birthday dinner here this weekend.   The decor of Cibo is so cute and charming. The lights outside on the trees are a good addition to outside lighting. The environment is good for a date night, wine night with girlfriends, or family dinner.   Since this was a large birthday dinner we were seated outside. When we first arrived there were no seats available for my sister and I. While they figured out how to add a few extra seats we decided to go inside to order a drink from the bar. While standing at the bar our waitress from outside came up to us (who we had not even seen yet) and \"barked\" at us that we can order drinks from outside. She then very RUDELY asked what can she get us. We order our drinks and my sister proceeded to ask her is we can start a tab, she again barked at us and said NO they don't do tabs. I could not believe how rude she was being. My sister casually said \"ok I will pay cash, I feel like I am starting to annoy you\" Her response was \"ok thanks\"!!!! I was appalled!!   Once we got seated outside the waitress' rude behavior continued. She just kept barking things at the guests, such as \"are you ready to order?\" in the rudest tone of voice! It was not just us, I witness her rudeness towards other guests at the table. My boyfriend ordered a beer and she brought the wrong one out. I corrected her and she says \"oh we were out of that one, but this beer is pretty much the same thing\". I am sorry but when is it EVER acceptable to do this. The correct thing would to come back tell the guest and recommend the similar beer or ask if there is anything else they would like.   Through out the time she continue to reach over guests without saying excuse me. I witnessed her spilling water on a guest without apologizing. I realize we were a larger party but if you cannot handle it ask for help or trade tables with someone. I am sorry you got the largest table in the place and made a hefty tip (not from me however)   The ONLY reason I rated Cibo a 4 instead of a 2 was because their food really was fantastic and my sister promises that she has never received anything less than great service from the waiters.   Recommendation to Cibo, fire your bitchy server I have NEVER received worse service in my life!! Being so rude to your guests is not good for your business!",

The bread was so amazingly soft with the crispy edge, no roof of my mouth scratches. I really wanted to ask for a loaf to go. Luckily the couple next to us got their pizza before we ordered because we almost ordered two.   I've only been here once. This was our starting point before checking out a show at the previously named Dodge Theater. Tried some potato, arugula, and sausage pizza. It was incredible. The crust had just enough fire burn crustiness to it. The ingredients were super fresh, I wanted more more more, although, my tummy said STOP the maddness silly girl!   Can't wait to go again, it got pretty busy, i think we got there just in time cause there isn't a whole lot of seating, and seems to be pretty happening. Actually, my BF was at a trade show in Worcester, MA, one of the guys in a booth next to him, said \"Wait, you're from AZ?...Have you tried Cibo? I go there every time I'm in the valley!\" We had to try it, thank you.",

Apparently the sauce will taste different if it is not cooked with the food. Ok.   My boyfriend ordered the Parmesan sandwich and it looked quite tasty. We both had the house salad which was good. The house chips are Miss Vicky's and brought to you sealed in their original bag. The patio is so beautiful on a nice, cool day with plenty of shade provided by the over-sized umbrellas and trees. I enjoyed a great lunch complete with tiny birds and a glass of white wine.",

    "text": "Phoenix is lucky to have a spot like this to claim. Cibo is a house built about a hundred years ago near downtown Phoenix that was converted to a pizzeria. The inside is fairly small with dim lights and wood floors. The outside is a little bit bigger with lots of trees lit up with Christmas lights and filled with swamp coolers. The restaurant is both intimate and casual at the same time. It almost feels like you are in another city that people actually congregate together instead of stay spread out miles apart.   The service is pretty good for how busy they can get. They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night be prepared to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to over an hour.   The price is fair to moderate depending on how much you want to taste. I recommend tasting as much as you can preferably with at least a group of 4.   The food is really good. Two of the appetizers that are hits are the antipasto which comes with meat, olives, mozzarella, and roasted peppers spread out on a large plate. The other is the burrata, which comes with this awesome bread slightly burnt, two home made mozzarella balls with a soft center and balsamic vinegar drizzled on top, and some prosciutto on the side. Both are really great and enough to share for 4 or more. If you can only get one definitely go with the burrata.   The pizza is what people really come here for but maybe a bit of a disappointment depending on what you are expecting. My favorite is the margherita with spicy salami added. The pizza is about a 12\" artisanal style. The toppings are good but honestly could be better. The sauce is a tasty but on the thick side. The dough is nicely charred but too chewy. Don't get me wrong, the pizza is delicious and blows away quite a few other options in AZ but it doesn't take the cake for me.   For dessert Cibo offers a few different crepes with nutella and fruit that are popular. Tastes like crepes filled with chocolate and fruit. Tastes decent but nothing special.   For two people with drinks, appetizer, pizza, and dessert you are looking right under a bill with tip.   Here's how I round it out:  Appetizer - 5 (burrata)  Service - 4  Price - 3.5  Pizza - 3.5  Dessert - 3   Overall - 4",

    "text": "Sweet Pea and I decided to have a relaxing night at Cibo last weekend, as we often do when we feel like just staying close to home, walking, and having insanely good pizza.  I'd been craving a good pizza to get the bad taste of The Parlor out of my mouth for a few weekends now, and Cibo is our favorite.  We've been here dozens of times, and it never disappoints. It was a perfect night for waiting outside, and it's a good thing, because when we got there at about 7pm on a Saturday night, the wait was already an hour and a half.  Man, I miss those days of not waiting.  I only hope that this place doesn't become the next Bianco.  At any rate, an hour and a half passes quickly with good wine and prosecco, and a table outside on a beautiful night, and we were seated outside on the patio in no time. We did our usual- our own salads (I have to always get the Caprese which is the best I've ever had with fresh tomatoes, delicious fresh mozzarella, and just enough pesto), and splitting a pizza- half diavolo for him, and half margherita for me.  He swears by the diavolo- being a pepperoni lover, he's obviously a fan of cured meats, but says this is way better than pepperoni.  Margherita is always so good with the sauce, just enough mozzarella, and whole basil leaves.  Then the usual desserts- the fresca for him which is a huge heaping crepe full of fresh fruit, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream, and the crepe Suzette for me, which comes flaming.  Crepe Suzette is my favorite dessert, and Cibo does it as well as any Parisian restaurant I've been to. I hate to Yelp it so high because it really is that good, and I hate waiting.  But Cibo deserves it.  It is, bar none, the best pizza in town.  And the atmosphere doesn't suck either.",

    "text": "Cibo doesn't appear to need my review, since they have a lot of fans here and other places.  This is a good lunch spot if you can get there early enough to avoid a wait.  The patio is particularly nice when the weather permits.  I work about five blocks from here and I've only been there for lunch.  I've wanted to try dinner but something about coming all the way back downtown after I've driven home to Gilbert just doesn't appeal.  Maybe on a day off sometime.  The food is great.  I like the speck sandwich.  Speck, for the uninitiated, is just another kind of cured ham like prosciutto.  The bread is always perfectly toasted.  Currently they offer as sides a salad, fruit, or chips.  An orzo salad, a la Carly's, would be a nice addition.",

Still haven't made it to Bianco, but why bother?  I've been to Cibo 3 times in the past few months and wouldn't have it any other way.  The service has always been spectacular.  There's a good selection of beer and wine, and an almost impossible-to-choose-from selection of pizzas.  We're not talking New York thin-slice sauce-and-cheese, we're talking locally sourced ingredients and artful combination.  Perfect crust topped with the perfect combination of delicious meats, cheeses, and veggies galore.  Your least favorite part of the meal will definitely be trying to pronounce the names of the pizzas.  Your favorite part of the meal might be the pizza, or it might be the ambiance (hard to decide between the cozy outside with live music and fire pit or the quaint inside that boasts everything downtown Phoenix is good at).    Go with a group of friends and stay a while.",

With so many reviews, I find it hard to bring anything else to the table with mine, but Cibo is so adorable I had to write a review anyway. I visited Cibo for dinner and fell like I was swept away to an adorable village in Naples. It was dark when we arrived and upon seeing the outdoor lights sparking on the courtyard patio, I immediately felt welcomed with open arms. When walking inside, the house was singing with visitors and staff alike. It felt like a home rather than a restaurant and what a good feeling that was. Although still a bit on the warm side, we sat outside underneath a grandfather tree and between the patio decor, glistening lights and secret garden-like atmosphere, it was already a positive experience without even tasting the food. The other visitors eating outside were regulars and immediately greeted us and began offering their suggestions when they realized they were talking to first timers. During the course of the dinner we started with Bresola and wine and contemplated about the pizza. But the regulars insisted that all first timers needed to try the Genova so we went with it and they were more than right. The Genova has mozzarella, homemade basil pesto, roasted potatoes white onions and grated Parmesan. All I can say is Grazia to the regulars because they know how to point newbies in the right direction!   Prior to visiting, I was told that Cibo beats most other pizza restaurants in Phoenix and all it took was one taste to agree. I'm adding this to resident and visitor must lists alike because I'm deeming Cibo a staple Phoenix restaurant for anyone who enters our desert oasis!",

The place feels \"cozy.\" As previous posts have pointed out, the restaurant is built into an old house. It's got a nice atmosphere. You can go with friend or take a date.  My group all ordered a pizza (Margherita, Prosciutto Crudo, and Salmone). No one had any complaints. Everyone liked the crust and the fresh ingredients. I'm not a big fan of ham, but the prosciutto was fantastic!  For dessert, we ordered the Nutella and Mascarpone. It was refreshing (on the day we went, it happened to be 115 degrees -- gotta love summer in Phoenix).  I'm glad I went, I'd go again, and I'd recommend the place to a friend.",

Quattro Formaggio pizza add balsamic onions for a total treat that is kind of like the best french onion soup ever. The antipasto is so good (I get it without meat). The Burrata is really creamy and delicious, I sub the meat for tomatoes with pesto. Ho shi! Last recommendation, the crepes. Any of them.

And that is what some restaurants in Phoenix have  - character.  And I think that is one of the things I like about Cibo.  First off, it is in this weird little neighborhood in downtown Phoenix and a little hard to get to if you don't figure out the one way street thing and wind up going down a street the wrong way.  Not too good an idea.  Then there is the fact that ya kinda wonder if your car will be up on blocks when you come out because of the neighborhood.  But Cibo is in a little 1920s bungalow and absolutely charming.  Another great date place!  Shrubs with those little white Xmas lights in them all around the old brick patio, cool old trees outside and the inside is pretty vintage-y too (I made that word up).. I have never eaten inside as the weather has been so darn great everytime I have been there that the patio is where I have wound up.  Anyhoo, on to the food- I think it is great.  I was suggested that I have their white pizza and add red sauce and it was amazing.  Lotsa cheese, gooey, and you could tell that the crust was made there, not prepacked and frozen or something like that. Seriously, that is the only kind I have had there so far and I have been there about 4 x.  Pretty sad...I should try other stuff but once I find something good... 'nuf said.  Their salad with fresh figs was great too.  Add a glass (ok, a bottle) of red wine and you are set.  Oh, and I think that it is the owner who hangs by the door outside and helps with the seating, which btw I think is a great touch.  Whenever an owner cares enough to be there and watch out for the place and assist, I think that is always a good sign.  Obviously the kitchen is doing good without her being back there! :)  Only one thing that I wish they would change/add:  different desserts?  I like Nutella but in everything?  There has gotta be something else you can do?  Buy?  Import? Just a thought....  I just wish that they would move that little house up north so that I can actually enjoy the evening without worrying about the looonggg drive back to Scottsdale..but I guess that is my problem!",

Service began slow, which my wife and I don't mind because we actually enjoy a less rushed meal.  The owner saw things getting backed up, and helped get our salad order expedited to our table.  The pizzas and wine were great, and the outdoor patio was unique and cozy on a cool April evening.  We enjoyed it so much we dined there again Saturday night.  This time we sat in a cozy corner and enjoyed another delicious pizza.  The owners are very nice.  We spoke to them during brief wait for our table.  Highly recommend the food, the atmosphere, and the service.",

    "text": "First things first.  A \"pizzeria\" should serve pizza all the time, including lunch, not just for dinner.  Where I'm from a \"pizzeria\" offers you pizza by the slice.  That being said I did enjoy some of the aspects of my dinner at Cibo.  The atmosphere and the service were fantastic.  The antipasto appetizer was great and puts the antipasto at Caffe Boa to shame.  (Although I did find the mozzarella in the antipasto to be rather flavorless which is bad because its my favorite type of cheese) The nutella crepe with bananas was heavenly, but then again anything with nutella is.  However, there are some pretty major drawbacks here for me.  The wine I had was pretty awful, which could have been my own fault.  I swear it was Franzia, or else came out of a box. Then there is the pizza.  We ordered the vegetarian pizza minus the mushrooms and were slightly shocked to discover when it came out that the toppings were spread individually on the slices.  So you have two slices with a single slice of roast zucchini, two slices with a single piece of artichoke, and two slices with a meager portion of red peppers.  For $11 for a 12\" pizza, it should be covered with toppings. I have never in my life seen a pizza constructed in such a fashion.  I like my toppings to be mixed together so you get all the flavors coming together at once on every slice.  With the size of the antipasto I was surprised to see that there were so little toppings on the pizza itself. We also ordered a calzone which was constructed in a similar fashion- a lot of meat on one side and cheese on the other.  And I have to say that there was a lot more dough than I would have liked there to be with the calzone.    I would be willing to go back to try some of their lunch sandwiches but as far as pizza goes its not going to work out between us.  Update:  I suggested Cibo to a friend over the weekend....only to find out they don't serve lunch on Saturday?  What?  If its so \"urban\" they should be serving lunch on the weekends!!!  Update:  I recently went to Cibo for lunch with Melissa H.  I have to say that I was completely underwhelmed by my sandwich.  The prosciutto was flavorless.  The mozzarella was almost non existent.  The tomato slice was huge.  I basically had a pressed tomato sandwich.  I didn't think it was possible for a sandwich to lack flavor that way but apparently it is.    People need to start eating better sandwiches if you think these are great.  They are mediocre at best.    Meh.  I'm so not impressed with this place. I'm sitting betwee a 2 and 3 right now but I'll give them the 3 since the service is always friendly and they have Miss Vicky's chips.",

Can you say Nutella crepe!?!?!?   Not to mention the meal complementing selection of spirits...   Cibo, I love you. My life would not be complete without you.

Our waiter, James came over and immediately we could tell he enjoyed his job and his love of the menu.  He had lots of suggestions and  we ended up with the following:  Arancini (fried stuffed rice balls) - to die for! Burrata Pear Salad Cappricciosa pizza fried dough balls with nutella Nutella and mascarpone crepe  Wow - to say we left happy is an understatement.

My friends each had sandwiches (of which I can't remember) but they all liked them.  The parking is a little rough, as there are only 6-8 spots in the lot behind the restaurant (a converted house in mid-town), but there is street parking nearby.  I suggest going early, as it is popular.  And I can see why.  The staff was very nice, and we were seated right away on the patio.  Our glasses were always filled.  I will be back!!!",

They were all super nice and very efficient. The person who does the hiring has a good eye for talent.   Focaccia appetizer was just okay. Bland even with the side of balsamic vinegar.   Pizza...  Excellent crust!  But again, bland. Mine had potatoes which I like on pizza but usually they are applied in thin slices. These were big chunks which made for a pasty, starchy texture.   Nutella crepe dessert was slimy. I felt the problem was an undercooked crepe. Maybe the kitchen is also too dark.  I wouldn't go back. Plenty of other good Neapolitan style pizza joints in Phoenix.",

    "text": "OK, my girlfriend and i were wanting to eat some Italian food, as she had just flown in from Chicago and the place that we really like has closed. Once we figured out that it was closed and got over the fact that we were going to miss eating there, we got on \"Yelp\" and started looking for an alternative. I also have a POI in my car that will give you names and locations or places close to where you are, between the two devices the place that both suggested was a place called \"Cibo\".  We live downtown and we thought, \"What the hell, it's close to the house and we haven't been there\". The only prerequisite that my girlfriend gave me was \"NO Pizza's\",as  she had just gotten back from Chicago and had pizza the night before. We get to this place and we had driven by it a million times, great patio and just packed on a Friday Night. We went in and decided to just eat at the bar since the wait was so long, she went to wash her hands and I took a look at the menu, 100% Pizza. By the way, she is Gluten Free, so I'm thinking were out of here and back to our search. Well the bartender comes up and we tell her our dilemma, she explains that they have the best \"Gluten Free Pizza in the World\". She just so happened to be \"Gluten Free\" also. So we decided let's go for it.  I am half Italian and was raised with Pizza, it was left overs on a pie crust., my grandfather put everything in the fridge on his Pizza. I'm not a big fan of Pizza for that reason, i still think of it as a way to get rid of leftovers.  Simply the best Pizza i have ever had in my life, \"Gluten Free\" or otherwise. This place is a gem and we will be spending a lot of time at this place moving forward. All weekend all we could think about was how good the Pizza was on Friday.  Go there if you haven't and you will love the atmosphere and especially the Pizza. If your \"Gluten Free\" it's a bonus because your in for a treat. I have found my only Pizza place from this moment forward. I will not go out to eat Pizza unless it is at Cibo's. I just can't even tell you how great it is, you will have to just try it yourself.

    "text": "I have been eating at Cibo for about 5 years now and had not been to Pizzeria Bianco until yesterday. I have been dying to participate in the Cibo vs Bianco challenge but the long wait at Bianco rarely fit into my schedule. That is, until my friend and I were able to stop in for lunch on a weekday when there was no wait...  The verdict? CIBO WINS!  Better menu, much bigger selection of pizzas, salads, and antipasti. Better prices (Bianco's pizzas are either $13 or $16, Cibo has many more choices ranging from $10.50 to $16.50 but most of their option avg. $14). Cibo offers a fantastic variety of pizza toppings.  The food at Cibo has never let me down. I have tried a number of things on the menu and it makes ordering very difficult these days because EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS!! But, if I had to create an All-Star Meal it would be as follows:  Pesto Salad (or Pear Salad; dammit, this is already tough) Antipasto Speciale (meat, cheese, olives, roasted peppers...and I remember these balsamic onions that I can't get enough of) Salsiccia (the BEST sausage pizza) Nutella and banana crepe (enough said)  This meal would feed 3 people, EASY!! My husband and I typically order two pizzas and a salad and still have a couple of pieces to take home.  I should also mention that we got married at Cibo almost two years ago. The food and service was impeccable that day (as always). Prepare to be impressed.",

It's located in a what looks like a residential neighborhood, with older nicely kept homes around it.    They have a very nice patio with a cool ambiance to it, right off the street but not noisy. And lots of heaters on the patio.  The inside of the place is really cool as it's an old bungalow house, with very few apparent modifications, so it retains the original charm.  Service was very good, with great knowledge of the menu and ingredients, since there were definitely some things on the menu I didn't know about.  The server was attentive, but not overly so.  Given their menu, I think they're aware that people often have take a bit longer to decide what to order.  And of course the food..  Awesome antipasto, fresh ingredients, a REAL Italian menu.  This would be a good place to bring people from out of town to show them we have some cool ambiance and great food right in central Phoenix.",

My first impression upon seeing the place was very good; for as busy as it was, it still felt small and intimate.  The 30 minute wait wasn't terrible considering the crowd, and after that, we were seated in a small corner of the house with only a few other tables in view.  When we arrived, the table on one side of us was empty, and the table on the other side had a family with a screaming baby just finishing up their meal.  When the waitress arrived, she took our orders.  I went with the marinara and a bottle of root beer.  The root beer came back barely chilled with a glass of ice.  First mistake.  Bottled soda should be served cold.  Pouring warm soda into ice leaves you with watered down soda.  At some point, someone at the table noted that we should have ordered appetizers because our food was taking so long.  Both of the other tables had received new parties, and their pizzas.  The waitress returned to apologize for our pizzas taking so long, but we must understand, there is a very large party they are serving outside.  Now, I don't like to get too philosophical when reviewing restaurants, but if the reason for the delay is a large party, why do the two tables, who were seated 5-10 minutes after us, already have their pizzas?  Eventually, of course, we received pizzas.   I noticed right away that all of the toppings could be found in a small region near one side of the pie, while entire slices contained nothing but sauce.  Clearly this was hastily assembled; no problem, I just took a few seconds to spread out the toppings.  Certainly the kitchen could have taken a little more care with my pizza.  As it turned out, the pizza was underwhelming.  It was a fine pie to be sure, but there are much better artisan pies in the valley.  If you are going to wait, you might as well go to Bianco.  If you want a crowded environment, go to Pomo.  Those places also have their issues, but they have better pizza.  Unfortunately, despite all the hype this place gets, I left with the realization that there's really no reason to come back.",

    "text": "Cibo is the CUTEST eatery I have ever been to in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area.   My boyfriend and I happened to be in the area, and turned to our trusty pal Yelp for some assistance. With four and a half stars and over 500 reviews, this place definitely caught our attention.   Located just minutes away from Downtown Phoenix, we were almost deterred away when we found Cibo located next to residential properties. But when we walked in, we were definitely down. It looks like a little tucked away cottage, something you wouldn't find next to the city.   The place is literally built in a refurbished little home. We walked in and were seated immediately. The menu was a tad difficult to understand, but wasn't that much of a deterrent, as we used yelp photos as our guide.   My only complaint is that they don't serve pizza until 5 p.m., but that wasn't really a big deal, as we made choices on the menu regardless.   I got the cous cous salad and the boyfriend got the meatball sandwich with chips.  Cous Cous salad came with fresh spring mix lettuce, diced grape tomatoes, pine nuts, cous cous, onions, and some other ingredients, and was dressed in a light lemon dressing. The dressing really was refreshing and light, but the salad itself was super filling and extremely flavorful! I would recommend it!   The meatball sandwich was really delicious as well. The meatballs seemed authentic and fresh, and it came with melted cheese and warm marinara sauce in between the crispy, yummy bread.   The bread that they served on the side of the entrees wasn't bad at all-- but it was served cold, which wasn't very appetizing, so I only ate one piece.   Service is friendly and helpful, and unique. I like places that allow their employees to dress how they wish. It adds a homey flare to the restaurant.   We definitely need to return for dinner on their cozy little patio! When I'm in the Downtown area again, I'll make sure to stop by at Cibo",

The location isn't in the historic district, but there's a larger patio, and the inside of the building is simply more comfortable in my opinion. I personally really like this spot in Phoenix. I can also personally recommend it as a great double- or triple-date spot!  Family friendly, yuppie friendly, hipster friendly, all with good wine and good food. Walking distance from downtown venues and clubs, it's a great way to kick your night off with good taste and class. If you're a pizza fan, and you're in Phoenix, this would be the place I'd call a \"don't miss.\"",

I also love love love the di notte pizza, but I add arugula. This past to ewe had our kids with us and we ordered the Blanca pasta off the kids menu and it was amazing. I think I will bring the kids again just so I can order it. The wait staff has always been gracious as well (which is necessary when dining with a 3 and 1 year old!) Love this place!  Update 7/28/17: continues to be one of the TOP restaurants in the valley. Celebrated my husband's birthday there last night and Megan provided exceptional service for our special date night. The food, as always, was an amazing experience. The fresh pasta with black truffle special was on point. Also the dolce vita white pizza will now be my new go-to entree. Exceptional. Call ahead if you want to know pasta specials, as their selection has changed, but they continue to impress.",

    "text": "Dear me, what HAS happened to Cibo? This darling place used to be a favorite among my colleague group, with delicious, fresh food and excellent service. However, today's visit for lunch was quite disappointing. While I was seated promptly, it took 15 minutes for a server to ask if I wanted something to drink other than water, then another 15 minutes transpired before the wine was brought to the table. The arancini, a long-time fave, tasted as if they were made last week, shoved to the back of a cold shelf, and reheated today, with a stale-tasting crust that could have broken a capped tooth, and nary more than a lilliputian morsel of cheese inside. The tomato sauce served with the rice balls was tasty, but there was barely enough for one arancini, let alone the 6 they served. The pesto salad was very good; however, the kitchen seemed to have tossed only the lettuce in the pesto dressing--no other ingredients--leaving the roasted potatoes, cheese, tomatoes, and pine nuts mostly devoid of dressing altogether, and I had to ask for more dressing. But mostly, for close to an hour, I couldn't raise a single server to ask for a second glass of wine, and finally had to get up and walk to the main entrance to flag someone down. While this glass arrived promptly, it was another 45 minutes before I finally had to get up again to see if the place had closed while I was eating, or, if the servers were on a break, or, if I might find someone otherwise unoccupied to bring me the bill so I could pay and get back to work. Good food means nothing if the service is so inattentive that diners feel as if they are intruding to ask for basic things like drinks and the bill. It's summertime in Phoenix--why alienate the locals on whom you depend for patronage during the slowest time of the year? There is simply too much competition among pizza places in the metro Phoenix area for this kind of lethargic service and the downturn in the quality of food, and I'll need to think intently before returning.",

    "text": "The day after Christmas, Mr. M and I met up with Tim S. to give Cibo a try.  We got there a little early to get a table and right away I was taken with how the restaurant looks as we walked up to it.  With all the white lights, outdoor seating, and the pretty bungalow, it felt very welcoming and a much appreciated respite from the typical strip mall setting.    We were greeted and seated right away by the host, and our server, Jessica, was there right away to take our drink and app orders.  Since it was still happy hour I took advantage of those great deals and ordered the Straccetti ($4) and the Polpette ($6).  We also ordered a glass of house red, which I think is a montepulciano, or maybe a sangiovese...I don't know.  Both are fun to say and it was only four bucks.  Those apps are both 5 star!  I aspire to make a meatball that good.  Flavorful, moist, and accompanied by a nice red sauce and some crusty bread.  The Straccetti are completely addictive and I highly recommend those as well.  The little touches of fresh basil ribbons and slivers of fresh parmigiano just made that one even more perfect.  I would order both of those again anytime.  Delicious!  My husband ordered the calzone and I thought, for almost 15 bucks, that better be one damn good calzone, and it was!  Absolutely excellent blending of flavors and it's huge.  It made for some great leftovers the next day.  The best item we ordered.    Tim and I decided to order 2 pizzas to share and the pizza margherita disappeared in a hurry.  Simple, and perfectly done.  Now, the pizza rustica on the other hand was better as leftovers because it was underdone when it was brought to us.  I am familiar with the fork and knife style of pizza, but as I tried to take a slice of this one, the crust just kind of smeared across the pan and was almost gooey even though it was very thin.  The prosciutto was good quality, but because it was underdone as well, its flavors really didn't come alive.  An edge of crust was burnt, which is fine if the rest of the pizza is done, but the middle and the overall pizza was not completely finished.    I warmed it up the next day in a hot oven on a stone, and then it still had that chewy crust consistency, but the great flavor of the prosciutto was there.  The arugula was wonderful.  Fresh and peppery as it should be.  They were extremely busy, which was expected, and I think they took that one out of the oven just a minute or two too soon.  No complaints, but it was noticeable that it was undercooked.  I am a big fan of leftovers so it was not a big deal.    Jessica took good care of us and we had a great time.  I would most definitely make a return trip to Cibo.",

    "text": "Finally got to try this place out tonight.  Long overdue, but I was glad that I made it down here.  My Yelp buddy Kate and I had planned on coming down here a few weeks ago but it didn't pan out.  Tonight worked though and we met here for some dinner.  I found parking on the street (randomly, right behind their car lol..St. Louis Cardinal fans can smell each others cars I guess) and walked a block down.  The restaurant is really cool.  It's an old converted house which is funky and awesome in it's own way.  Kate and her husband got there before me and grabbed us a table inside.   I sat down and ordered a Diet Coke to drink.  Kate and her husband had already ordered some appetizers for us (Polpette- Meatballs and Straccetti- Fried pieces of pizza dough topped with tomato sauce and parmigano and basil).  We then placed our order for our pizzas.  Me and Kate decided to split 2 pizzas so we could try out some different things.  We went with a basic Margherita and we also went with a white pizza called the Rustica which came with procsiutto and arugala.  Kates husband ordered the Calzone.  Here is how everything tasted...............  Appetizers:  Polpette-  They serve this dish with 3 meatballs which were topped with some grated cheese and a few slices of crusty bread.  These meatballs were very good!  They were tender and delicious.  The sauce these were in was very tasty too!   Straccetti-  These come about 9 to a plate.  They are little strips of dough...think, funnel cake/churro bites, but made out of regular dough.  They are topped with their delicious sauce and basil strips.  These were great too!  They seriously reminded me of little churro pieces but without the sugar on them.  Great fried dough and a definite repeat too.    Pizza/Calzones:  Margherita-  I usually order a plain pizza when I'm trying a new place out.  You can tell a lot about a pizza place just by their cheese pizza.  This rendition was pretty good.  Not as good as some other places in town, but still a tasty pizza.  I liked their sauce, cheese and crust.  I didn't like that they put too much basil on it plus it was cut really odd.  There were like 2 huge gigantic pieces and then 6 real small ones.   It was a tad thin in parts too.  Still, a good pizza but not a \"great\" pizza.  Rustica-  This was a white pizza (olive oil base) topped with prosciutto and arugala after it was cooked.  I didn't like this one nearly as much.  It sounded way better than it tasted.  It tasted like regular ham on pizza plus the arugala threw me off.  I don't need no stinking salad on my pizza!  I never had this kind of pizza before so I'm glad I tried it but wouldn't get it again.  This one was cut irregularly and a bit thin in spots too.  Calzone-  This may have been the best item ordered.  Louie chose well!  This calzone is a huge, football shaped pocket of goodness.  It had a great outer crust and it was stuffed with mozzarella, ricotta, some kind of spicy salame/pepperoni and some other stuff too.  I only had a little sample of it, but I would definitely get it again if I come back.   It was tasty and better than the 2 pizzas we got.  Total bill was ?.  Louie grabbed the check before I could see it.  I threw in some money for a tip, we sat around and talked for a bit and then we were on our way.  Service was very friendly and attentive.  I liked the vibe of the place too.  I could see myself coming back for sure.  The food was like a 3, but the vibe, company I was with,  and the service bring it up to a 4 star joint!",

Wonderful wine selection, and the food is amazingly fresh and delicious!  Menu ranges from light bites to full on meals that'll load ya full of carbs.  Pasta dishes are great and the chef often whips up new and exciting things.  Highly recommended...",

The crusts on both pizzas were good with a fair amount of char but could have been a little crispier. I would highly recommend this place if it there weren't better pizza places in Phoenix (Bianco?).  I would give the pizza 3.5 to 4 stars.  However, their pizza menu is quite extensive and I would like to revisit and try some other pizza styles.    We did have the Nutella and Mascarpone cheese crepe and it was great.   Note, most of the patrons there were having salads and sandwiches which looked really good!",

The only gripe I have is about the difficult parking situation, but I won't deduct any stars because this is really beyond their control. Food is fantastic. I highly recommend the Tartufata (sp??) pizza and a nutella crepe for dessert. Customer service is always great. This would be an excellent choice for an occasion- date night, anniversary, birthday. Not great for a bigger crowd- better for a small/intimate duo.",

I will keep the 10AM weekend opening in mind.  The weather was predicted to be a bit warm so we opted for an interior seat. The service was prompt. I mentioned that we weren't in a hurry and would probably take our time and chat.  The waitress returned timely with drink refills, but we felt no pressure to hurry our meal.  Plus #1.  We had the Saltimbocca Freddi and Fritatta Melfitana for the main course. Very fresh ingrediants prepared to perfection.  Plus #2  The BIG Plus #3 was the dessert.  Dessert for breakfast...YES!!  We decided to try both sweet crepes and share. This is a great option because both were so good that I couldn't have picked just one.  Nuttella and Mascarpone was warm. The waitress mentioned topping it with ice cream which was a perfect recommendation.  Frutti di Bosco was topped with mixed berries that were so perfect that you wanted to pick them off the crepe with your hands and just pop them in your mouth.  Maybe that is a good reason to get one of your own?  I also noticed that the hostess seated people throughout the restaurant, giving everyone a lot of personal space.    Highly recommended for a weekend meal if you are in downtown Phoenix.",

We decided to sit inside as it was a rather warm morning and we walked (trying to burn some of the calories we were about to consume). We sat at a table right buy the window over looking the patio (which is dog friendly). As we perused the menu a fly kept buzzing around the table. I understand flies get in and I'm OK with that, BUT this one fly turned into about 8 full sized flies and a million little gnats. I was actually killing the bugs as they flew around our table there were SO MANY! We even had some fall in our drinks. Ugh! The food was good. we ordered the Uova Arizona and Fritatta Melfitana. They were both good but the Uova Arizona was the best.  I am so sad that the flies ruined an otherwise wonderful breakfast. I guess we should have sat outside...there would have been fewer bugs.",

The pizza came with zucchini, mushroom, roasted red pepper, and artichoke. When the pizza came, it was strange because each slice only consisted of the one topping, it was not distributed throughout the full pizza. Having a slice of pizza with one thin slice of zucchini on it was not what I expected. As we were down to the last coupe of slices, we also noticed there was a long black hair on it - really gross. This place has a cute and cozy atmosphere, but I probably would not go back. Maybe if I ordered something else it would have been better, but overall I was very disappointed with my meal.",

I have been here one other time 6 years ago on a blind date and had forgotten just how good the food was.   We started off with the ever popular Burrata, which is- fresh mozzarella with a creamy heart topped with a balsamic glaze served with black label prosciutto crudo and toasted bread. From what I understand it is goats milk cheese that is flown in fresh daily and they have limited quantities. To say this is like butter is an understatement. It was delicious!!!!! Next I ordered the Rustica which is mozzarella, topped with prosciutto crudo and arugula after pizza is cooked. It took everything in me not to eat the entire damn pizza. Dottsy ordered the Prosciutto Crudo which is similar except hers has red sauce and no arugula. My goodness. I am still shaking my head and kicking myself for giving Dottsy all the leftovers. What in the world was I thinking? I will be back again very soon and not wait 6 years for another visit.",

Every item seemed to come with several side dishes and Nutella is always an option for your toast!! They don't have many vegetarian dishes, but what they do have they cook to perfection.    The thing that really gets my panties in a knot is that they charge $6.50 for a mimosa!  How is a girl supposed to nicely toasty before noon at that price?!

We dined outside in a lush setting which also allowed our grand children the room to be out and about. We ordered multiple items from the menu some of which was the pulled pork sandwich on focaccia bread, a sausage sandwich also on focaccia,  an antipasto salad, a caesar salad and a pizza with prosciutto. I can't say enough words to describe how great everything tasted. The salad ingredients were fresh and the breads and pizza was over the top. Im so glad we chose this place to celebrate our daughters huge achievement. We'll definitely be back. If there was anything negative I'd have to say it was our server Amanda. She never had a smile on her face and we felt like our group size was too much of an inconvenience for her. Maybe we got her on a bad day....it happens.

    "text": "Seriously, WOW AND YUM. I am one of those \"Poor unfortunate fools\" that has to follow one of those very strict diets to prevent inflammation. It was an Italian place so I was worried that meant pizza and spaghetti. THANK GOODNESS I was wrong! I had the most beautiful antipasto board (See picture). I couldn't eat the tomatoes or zucchini, but the rest was all wonderful.  For the first time in a long time, I'm FULL! Plus, my tastebuds are sooooooooo happy. The meats, cheeses, veggies, nuts, fruits all made for a fantastic meal. Now let's talk service, VERY attentive without being annoying, no pressure to get me out while I sip wine and write this review. It's November and the patio is cool and charming. I would return here often if it wasn't in another state. Thank you Cibo for making my week brighter! I'll be back next time I'm in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Cibo is a very hipster, new-age pizzeria in downtown Phoenix. They have complimentary valet and indoor/outdoor seating.  We sat outside, which was decorated for Halloween. It was REALLY HOT and there are no misters. The live music was a nice touch, but it was WAY too loud. The tables are arranged oddly and you're often side-stepping to get around people.   The pizza was okay, but nothing over-the-top. The \"Il Tagliere\" was a good mix of an appetizer. Lots of different cheeses and meats to share for the table.   Overall a 3 out of 5 stars. I won't be back.",

Tonight: The Saffron Scallop Papadelle. Is it possible to concoct a more deliciously simple yet exquisite dish? This dish was off the hook amazing. I would eat it every day.  Never had it?  Get your ass down here and get it before Chef moves on.  Second great thing about tonight: The live music. Two dudes playing some extra entertaining interpretive classics. A keyboard & guitar is all. Brick House & Use Me, both classics and skillfully adapted by these guys. Anyone know who they are or where else they play? I mean these guys were Rhythm Room worthy.",

    "text": "Food: 3.0 Atmosphere: 5.0  I dropped by Cibo on a Friday afternoon to grab pizza with a friend. Having never been there, I didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised by the gorgeous outside patio! My friend and I were seated under a charming little tree all done up with lights and were really taken with how pretty everything looked. It was a slightly chilly night, but the outside heaters were more than adequate to help keep us warm throughout dinner. We're both cat lovers so we loved the roaming cats that were walking around the patio as well!   Now, for the food. Let me start off by saying that I am a giant pizza FIEND. Pizza is what I crave almost all day, every day so I'm always looking for new, great places where I can get some delicious pizza! I also love arancini balls to death and basically jump up and down if I see them on a menu. When it came down to ordering, we grabbed the arancini, the margherita pizza, and the genova pizza. The arancini balls were good, but lacked a bit of inherent flavor and the margherita pizza was similar in the sense that it was good, but definitely on the blander side. The genova pizza, to me, was honestly a bad idea. The potato on the pizza was rather chunky and not sliced thin as I'd expected. Furthermore, the starchy texture of the potato mixed with the grainy texture of the pesto made it a really strange mouthful to swallow. Also be warned that the onions on this pizza are basically raw. I love onions, but there are only so many bites of raw onion that I can tolerate per meal.   Service was good overall and we were definitely attended to quite well throughout the night. I loved this place for the patio, but not so sure about the food.",

The food was great although my rigatoni, which was a featured dish could have been a bit sweeter for my taste. The bread is the kind of crusty bread you find in authentic italian resturants. The house wine very good and crepes for dessert were wonderful. The coffee \"Americana\" is expresso and quite tasty. Prices were not bad however, finding parking is a bit difficult.",

The patio was romantic and even though it was a little chilly out they had plenty of heaters around. We started with a nice bottle of Chianti which was delicious. And then had the burrata which was the perfect amount for two people to share to start. Then we had the salsiccia and the diavola which were both amazing! After having an appetizer two pizzas were a little too much food but still tasty and nice to try a couple things. Service was quick and very friendly!",

I also Order through post mates when I don't feel like going out.   The reason I am updating my review is because of my recent visit here over the weekend. My husband and I decided to go here for dinner this last Friday night to have a relaxing evening and to enjoy some great food. We wanted to sit out side because the weather was amazing and they have a great ambiance outside. When we got there we asked the hostess to be sat outside and I pointed to a table that I wanted to sit at because it was close to a heater and in the corner. I'm all about ambiance and felt this was an ideal table to sit at. I understand that sometimes hostesses cannot put people in certain sections because they don't want to give some waitresses more people over others etc. when I pointed out the table, the blonde hostess was extremely rude and said \"no, actually, you're going to sit over here, we already double sat over there\". I would have waited until a spot opened in that area, but she didn't give any options. We were shocked she was so rude and went to Pomo instead, which was a good choice, because we always neglect Pomo and forgot about it. We never walk out of restaurants, but this time we had to. The second we walked in Pomo, the manager told us to pick a seat, any seat, which was ironic.   Good food, bad service. No one wants to go to dinner and be treated that way. Especially when you support their business often and encourage others to do the same.",

Cibo ended up being a cute spot for date night, located in a converted house complete with cozy nooks to get some privacy with your partner.   Cibo speicalizes in Neapolitan style pizza, with blistered edges and a \"wetter\" middle. If you don't like that type of pizza, you might not enjoy your experience here. We shared an the meatball appetizer (three huge balls!) and a glass of wine, then split the Capricciosa pizza,  topped with proscuitto, mushrooms, artichokes, and olives, the dough miraculously remaining light despite the ton of toppings! Our meal was filling and reasonably priced ($40), but we opted for dessert elsewhere, as all of Cibo's options are sweet crepes.",

Maybe I'd come back to give it another try if someone else invited me. Maybe I just got the wrong kind of pizza?",

    "text": "Cibo is great.  I've been coming here since 2005 and it's been a favorite for casual and intimate nights out.  The pizza is good, but not my favorite in Phoenix.  I really enjoy their salads and desserts.  The crepe with Nutella inside, fruit on top and icecream is absolutely delicious!  And I usually don't even like crepes.  The cons - no parking lot, so you have to search for street parking or use their valet service; also poor ventilation inside, so your clothes and hair end up smelling like their pizza oven; the noise level inside can get pretty loud.",

Must say i was impressed.  Lively atmospher. Fantastic food and wine.  Melissa was a great server.   We had some wine at the bar for an hour then got our seat outside.  Perfect night with great food and service with a fun  atmosphere.  I now tell everyone to check out Cibos if in Az.   The people working here also love dining at Breadfruit.  It's refreshingly cool to see local businesses support each other.  This place is a converted house.  Thanks Cibos for a great saturday night.",

San Diego has its fair share of incredible Italian restaurants, but Cibo has met and surpassed our expectations.  The pizza was nothing but authentic, crepes to die for, delicious Caprese Salad, and homemade Limoncello just iced the cake for us.  We can't wait until our next visit to Phoenix so we can come back",

I would come here just for a special desert date, without a doubt! Pizza here is pretty classic, so I can't complain. The only reason I took off one star is because our waiter was kind of scatter-brained. He was definitely nice enough, and maybe it was just his first day. However, the service suffered a little bit. At one point, he asked my party what we wanted drink, just to  neglect the one person that quickly responded with her order. He handed people the wrong orders and kind of disappeared a lot. Lastly, it took him forever to get our checks out at the end because he \"lost track\" of a beer that one couple in our group ordered. All in all, I would still come back. I enjoyed myself.",

It is in an old house possibly early 1900s near downtown Phoenix. I have eaten in the dining room, the parlor and out on the lawn. My favorite was on the lawn, it was a beatiful day and we had the antipasto platter. They also had live music that evening and the vibe was fabulous. The other dish that stands out in my mind was the Nutella Crepes, I had them for dessert and they were scrumptious. The wait is sometimes long and parking can be a little tough but it is well worth the wait.",

Delicious! We also had the wood fired Margherita pizza. The crust was incredible! Could have used a little more mozzarella, but overall really delicious and then comfortable dessert we had the crepe filled with mascarpone al limone cheese with fresh berries- a must have !  Go! Make it a date night, sit on the patio, they have live subtle music too. And it's totally an affordable place. Enjoy!",

You can spilt the pizza in half which was cool but it was honestly a crappy pizza. They don't offer ranch because it's \"authentic.\" It was bland and dominos honestly is way tastier! I didn't get the crepe because the pizza alone was a whopping $22. You're better off going to fired pie.... Or dominos. Disappointed I didn't get the crepe, I'm sure those are delicious.

The acoustics was unappealing for people who just wanted to relax and dine. Our server was very friendly and informative regarding menu. We ordered Calamari which tasted rubbery. Ordered the Meatballs and when they came with the Pizzas, they were only like warm at best. My wife ordered the Margahrita Pizza and the other was the Salcchica. The crusts were very good on both pizzas. The sauce was very bland. The Sausage was wet or very juicy which made the center of pizza soupy. Being in the restaurant business for over 40 years, including 3 Pizza restaurants, I was very diasapoited with all the hype Cibo was getting on FB saying they were the Best in Pizza in Phoenix. La Orange Cafe in Arcadia is so much better. Positive note was that the sandwiches and salads looked very good. Again our server was super friendly and sweet. Both of us being in restaurant management, we were kinda diasapoited that when we were leaving, the male who looked like a Manager, standing by the front door, didn't even acknowledge us or say thank you for coming or hope everything was delicious. He was just standing there. That's a No Brainer if you want to keep Guests coming back. Being Pizza lovers, we were not impressed. Sorry. Not recommending to friends and family.",

    "text": "First of all, I have to say for all those comparing it to Bianco what a compliment right off the start for this place.  Being compared to a place that was I believe voted the best Pizza in the USA by USA today (I think) should right away tell you something about this place.  I am not going to compare the two as both are fantastic places with excellent food.  If I had a last meal and one of these two were served I would not die unsatisfied!  So after about a year of trying to find the right time to go there my wife, 9 year old daughter and myself along with a few friends, we made it to Cibo last eve for dinner.  We goti there at 5:45 pm on a Saturday night, thankfully had reservations and sat right down.  First impressions, am I back east at a great eatery.  The ambiance being downtown outside was just fantastic, something I have not experienced here in Phoenix since moving here in the mid 90's.  Very old world, loved it!  We started with two appetizers, the meat plate with cheese, some grilled veggies and some fruit and the eve's special the fried rice and cheese balls with marinara sauce.  Both were spot on, delicious and loved by all at the table.  Onto the pizza's, what more can you say than spectacular.  My daughter and her friend had the margarita pizza with no basil, my wife the spicy salami red pizza, they all raved and devoured theirs quickly.  Myself I wanted to try two pizzas and was amazed that at a place with individual pizza's like this you can get 1/2 and 1/2.  What a treat and beyond what I expected at a artisan pizza place like this.  So I LOVE white pizza and went  with one half of the potato and sausage pie and 1/2 of the 4 cheese and spicy salami pie.  WOW is all I can say.  Now the sausage and potato half was very good, but it did not even compare to the 4 cheese and spicy salami.  The cheese on that side had great flavor, salt and spice, I sadly shared one (yes only 1) slice of the pie with the rest of the table and the reaction was the same.  Why didn't I order that?  If you like cheese, salt and spice, this is the pie for you!  All that food and yep we still had to try dessert.  My daughter LOVES nutella and they have about 4 or 5 crepes with nutella in them.  She and her friend went with the nutella, strawberry, banana and chocolate crepe with vanilla ice cream on top.  DELISH.  Glad they were kind of full after 1/2 way thru it as the rest of the adults at the table gladly finished it off.    The adults went with the Fresco dessert, crepes with fresh fruit and whipped cream on top.  It was also fantastic (but next time I would go Nutella), very light and a perfect ending to a great dinner.  Its quite a drive from my house in S.E. Chandler to this place, thankfully we had an event downtown.  Would I make this trip for dinner with the wife on a weekend eve, without a doubt worth it.  Would I make sure to go there next time I am downtown for anything.  Heck yes!  This is just the kind of place that I love.  Great food, great atmosphere.  One of the most enjoyable dining experiences I have had in Phoenix.",

I love good bread! I ordered my sandwich with the fruit salad as my side and was in love with it. It came with yogurt and granola on it and was more like a dessert, which I always love!

The place is nestled behind a row of trees that afford some privacy for the patio diners.  The menu is mostly comprised of pizzas but it offers a wide selection of both red and white sauce varieties.  There is also a decent selection of salads to accompany your meal.  Tonight I shared a salad with goat cheese strawberries and cartelized walnuts. Very delicious combination.  For dinner I had a red sauce pizza with artichokes, prosciutto and olives(whole). Quite a scrumptious flavor explosion. I didn't sample the desert menu which is made up of crepes of various flavors, although most of them entail Nutella.  The servers were extreme knowledgeable about the menu and provided excellent service.  Although I have to admit that the service was a little slow at the end. Overall this was a great place to spend a dinner with friends and celebrate a birthday.",

The location is excellent too. Plenty of parking nearby -- a treat for Downtown Phoenix.   The food is phenomenal. Any pizza you order at this place is sure to be a home run. I recently got to visit them on an anniversary of the shop and they had plain ol' cheese pizza and even that was out of this world.   The wine/beer selection is also top notch. Not many places have great wine and fantastic craft beer to go along with some awesome pizza.   The ONLY thing I wish this place did was serve their pasta every day of the week. I'm pretty sure they only have it available on Tuesdays(?) which, if you just so happen to be there for pasta day, DO IT.   All in all Cibo is a great place to go with a loved one or just some friends. The food is great, wine and beer is good, awesome atmosphere and reasonably priced.   Highly recommend.",

The salsicca and the margherita pizza are my favorites here.  I know everyone always questions the crust when reviewing a pizza.  Well, it's not a gourmet crust like Pizzeria Mozza in LA.  It's probably the closest thing I've had to pizza I've found in Rome.  Not too thin crust, slightly crispy and slightly chewy, minimal toppings & a great sauce.  The fresca or the Nutella and banana  crepes complete a great meal!",

Our group of 4 headed there Saturday night, and were immediately charmed by the atmosphere with the cute patio seating and white lights.  We arrived at 7ish and got a drink at the bar (a plus - Nimbus beer from Tucson!  And a $5 glass of Pinot Grigio!)  before being seated outside in about 20 minutes.    Our waiter was super friendly and helpful, suggesting the indecisive BF order half Prosciutto Crudo and half Salsiccia.  The rest of us ordered the Margherita - I know, I know, original.  More points to the waiter, who didn't look at my friend like a weirdo when she ordered her Margherita sans the cheese. Also, there was one woman who seemed assigned to water distribution only, and was on top of refilling our glasses.  And for me, that was every 5 minutes.    We started with the Caprese Salad, which was different but oh so delicious.  The cherry tomatoes were soaked in the pesto, oregano, and olive oil and were very flavorful - great with the mozzarella.  I could've used more basil leaves or arugula, but whatev.   The pizza's were mmmmm, mmmmm good but didn't blow me away.  Again, I could've used more basil leaves, but my fellow margherita eaters took theirs off, so again, personal preference.    I would definitely return for the overall ambience and uniqueness of Cibo, as well as the friendly staff and owners.  Definitely a downtown treat!!",

Classy, great vibe and delicious food are some of the highlights to this charming little restaurant. We had a big group and even two that arrived late and the staff was able to accommodate everyone. We ordered at least 5 pizzas and everything was fresh and flavorful. They have a good selection of drinks as well. I wanted a white wine spritzer and they didn't have club soda so I was offered sprite instead to mix with my wine and it actually tasted great! For dessert we all shared one that had nutella AND bananas. Mmmm. I would definitely come here and again and recommend it to all my friends.",

Even before you sink your teeth into one of Cibo's sultry pizzas you will fall in love with the quaint yet fun atmosphere of this little gem of a restaurant. Then, after you are seated, you will fall in love with the two cutest waiters ever! As if that weren't sweet enough, the fresca crepe is the absolute most delectable dessert on the face of the planet!  All of Cibo's courses are fresh and flavorful. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu. The last time I was there with my five friends, we sat outside at a table next to the fire pit. We ordered the house salad, the pesto salad, the vegetariana, the diavola, the margarita, and finished it off with two frescas. The only thing that could have made the night better, was if the cute waiters would have joined us ;-)  I can't say enough good things about this place!",

    "text": "Was craving pizza and this was my last night in Phoenix. Yelped nearby restaurants and this one caught my eye. I love wood oven pizzas and dessert crepes and having both in one place was a dream come True. Went with my neice, who lives nearby and had never been here. The restaurant is in a great space though the location is a bit odd. This combination, for me, adds to it's appeal. The place was packed but we had a very short wait. By the time we left, there was quite a crowd gathered outside.  We started with caprese salad with homemade mozzarella. The texture of the cheese was spectacular and the tomatoes were good but not great. Perhaps that's because I'm from California, home of the sweetest tomatoes around. We decided to order two pizzas, one with red sauce and one with white because it all sounded and looked so good. We ordered the capprioso and the white pizza with pear (can't remember the actual name) The crust was the key. I'm giving Cibo 4 stars because the actual flavors of the toppings and sauce on the pizza are not as flavorful as I expected and not as bold as I like. Everything was very mellow. But man, the crust rocked my world. I might try some other toppings that have a stronger taste to see if they are better but what we picked was on the border of bland. The True highlight of the mean was the dessert crepe we ordered. We ordered two pizzas and one crepe but we should have ordered one pizza and two crepes. True, we got nutella in the crepe which is a gimme in terms of tastiness but we added strawberries and whipped cream which took it over the top. The crepe itself was light, airy and just melt in your mouth good.   I thought about giving Cibo 4 stars but I just couldn't do it. I wanted to love everything about this place but I just didn't. When the best flavor I had was nutella, you know there's a slight the problem. I honeslty wasn't impressed with the toppings and the flavor and the quality of the pizza sauce but the crust won me over. I would definitely come back for both the atmosphere and the food and perhaps a different pizza would be better. The servers ran around and seemed to work hard though the food came out slower than I expected and the wait staff, while flying around and by often, wasn't actually attentive. If ever in Phoneix again, I look forward to trying more things on this menu but until then, I can only say it's good but not great and certainly did not blow my socks off.",

My father and I were greeted and promptly sat but it went down hill after that. Staff hit all 3 tables around us before we were able to meet our new server. Maybe it was the shift change.

Perfect for Phoenix since it's perpetually warm almost all the time during the summer, fall and spring months.  We came here because of the phenomenal reviews, and also because everyone said it was better than Biano.   I have to say, their daily pasta specials are amazing because the pasta is homemade! I am a sucker for homemade pasta even though I don't like Italian food for the most part ... sooo delicious. The food comes out extremely fast!   The pizza here is the thin style wood-fired oven kind, which is great, and their overuse of truffle oil is totally ok with me. I loved the truffle mushroom pizza, and we got ricotta on the Diavlo.

The food, like I said, is good but I think part of what gets this place its charm is the cute outdoor lights and homey placement; it's literally a historic home turned restaurant. Parking can be a hassle during their peak hours, but they offer free valet if you're lucky enough to land a spot. I've been to Cibo many times and I've tried many of their dishes, but for the price you're better off checking out some other downtown italian places that offer amazing quality in their food. There's even a sweet little trattoria in Scottsdale that offers these same prices, except there a heavy accented Italian owner comes to your table to check on you and the authenticity and ingredients are unbeatable.",

The pizza sauce isn't overwhelming and doesn't get in the way of the pizza.  It's like sitting around late at night reminiscing with an old friend. My only gripe is that the crust gets a wee bit soggy. I don't like the soggies.",

Pretty much everything on the menu is amazing. My favorite pizza (which is pictured) is the margherita + Italian sausage. Today we weren't feeling dessert (super rare because it's soooooo good) but usually we also have the Fresa. Trust me, get it. It's amazing. Aside from the delicious food, the service is always on point despite how busy it may be. Everyone is super friendly, welcoming and it really feels like you're at home when you come here! Cibo is certainly a gem in the heart of Phoenix!!",

Our server informed us that it was still happy hour, so we had arancini and gnocchi as an appetizer, and we split a margherita pizza for dinner. All of our food was delicious, but our pizza had a few very burnt black spots on the edge - that could be normal for the style of pizza or the type of oven they used. I will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items and maybe one of the five Nutella-based desserts.",

It was within walking distance of the Hyatt Regency..Phoenix has lovely weather in February.   This place is super cute with all the lights outside, fire pit, little water fall/fountains for the birds to play in. Definitely cutesy plate for dates and couples! We got there at just the right time, because soon enough, the place was packed and everyone had eyes on our table. The owners are constantly serving people and accommodating everyone, super cool. Even though we were pretty much done with our meal, we didn't feel rushed to leave ASAP.   Several people in our group got the Pesto and Pear Salad. I tried the Pesto Salad and loved it. The potatoes are yum! I got the Funghi pizza and added sausage (posted a picture of this one), a friend got the salmone, and another got a calzone (huge btw!) The salmone was interesting, I've never had salmon on my pizza before - but I liked it. We all wanted to get crepes at the beginning of the meal, but ended up having a lot of pizza leftover and no room for dessert. When I come back to Phoenix in January, I am going to split a pizza and salad with someone and get dessert - no doubt.",

The menu is super confusing unless you speak Italian. I am warning you because you won't find many pasta options. For example, they don't have Lasagna, Ravioli, etc. Then they gave us jugs of warm water (105 degrees outside).  Who wants warm water on a hot night?  Next, the Asian waitress we had was very impatient with our menu questions.  I thought it was just me that noticed that, but then 2 other people in my party mentioned that she was quite rude. Also, no bread was served while we waited for our meal.  I guess they only serve bread for an additional $2?  The food was so-so, light on the sauce for the pizza I ordered, but my appetizer was good.  I had to complain to the manager, who was nice, about our rude Asian waitress.  I don't normally ever complain but she was that rude.  I was ready to walk out, but I was with a large group of 11 people.  If it was just me and my family, we would have walked out.  Don't go there is my advise.",

And when you factor in wait times (15 minutes on a First Friday night at 7pm), parking (much better, being on the west side of downtown), and leftovers (the pizza crust holds up remarkably well under microwaving), it's really no question.  We started with the burrata, and I really can't recommend this enough: two mountains of creamy, fresh mozzarella, sliced prosciutto that melts in your mouth, and toasted bread that's just soft enough to keep from dicing the roof of your mouth. The only problem was, by the end of it (and we scraped every bit of cheese up) we were hardly hungry. Between the two pizzas we ordered between my wife, me, and our daughter, we finished less than half. From now on, we'll go with the burrata, and split a pie...though then we'd miss out on the leftovers. I'll have to rethink this.  A few minor quibbles: it'd be nice of the beers were on tap. My Lagunitas IPA wasn't quite cold enough. Also, the main entrance is a tight fit, but it's worth it for the ambiance, I think.  Beyond that, though, everything about Cibo, from the food to the charming owners, was exceptional. I only half-jested that I'd like to go back today.",

After hearing SO much about it and working downtown for 10 years, it sure has taken me a long time to get there!  Even the deserted patio (at 5:30 on a Thursday in August) made me happy.  Walking inside, instantly greeted by a friendly host, followed by an equally friendly server.  Service was stellar, attentive, kind, informed, relaxed but not lazy, and suggesting menu items which I always appreciate.  We decided on the special pizza of the night.  Pizza Marechiaro : Fresh Bufala Mozzarella, San Marzano Dop, Chopped basil and Sea salt!  Like a \"super-margherita\" the server said.  How could we NOT get it?  We also go the Pesto Salad which came with roasted potatoes, a light pesto dressing, and delicious bread to go with.  The salad was delicious as was the pizza!  The ingredients were super fresh, the crust was the perfect amount of chewy, the prices were reasonable, and YES there was not a two hour wait to go with the food (even though, I still love the other place too!).  The only part that I didn't love was that the super fresh tomato-ey sauce made the crust a little droopy when I picked it up.  My favorite is a crispy crust that doesn't fall when you take a bite, but hey, small price to pay for perfection every where else.  Even the tiny little flowers in the tiny little bud vase on the table made my day!  I can't wait to go back again . . . and again . . . and again.  Lucky me I work about a mile away!  You (may or may not) know me, I hardly give five stars on just one visit, but trust me, this has five stars written all over it!!",

It had zero flavor and the bread that it came with was stale. I never use extra salt on my food but found myself putting salt on the burrata. It was very bland and the center was not creamy like it should be. I still like the atmosphere but that doesn't make up for the lackluster food.",

Attentive, gracious wait staff. The portions are plentiful and delicious. I ordered the Calzone- enough for dinner and lunch tomorrow too. My son was able to finish his Pappardelle Bolognese but hubby has leftovers for tomorrow too. We split the Fresca dessert 3 ways-more than enough for all of us. And very reasonably priced as well.",

    "text": "Until I discovered Cibo's gluten-free pizzas, I thought I had to give up pizza forever.  Their gluten-free crust is tasty, and perfect for their variety of toppings.  My preference is the vegetariano.  The sauce is just the right amount of spicy, and the vegetable toppings are fresh.  Cibo has been my go-to restaurant for pizza for several years.    I called in a take-out order today, but the server did not note that I wanted a gluten-free crust.  After discovering the problem, I had to drive back to Cibo to get a replacement.  The server never apologized and seemed to treat it as no big deal.  I was upset with the way the server treated me, and phoned the manager / owner, Guido.  He was so apologetic and helpful.  He promised to talk to the server and make sure this doesn't happen again.  Guido handled the situation expertly.  I am confident that he will give the server more training - or get rid of him.  Guido exhibited great customer service.  In spite of the potentially severe medical problem that could have been caused by the server's lack of attention or interest. I know every restaurant will have problems once in a while.  When they handle it well and make sincere apologizes and amends, their customers will return.  I will return to Cibo knowing Guido is aware of what happened and will remedy the problem.",

    "text": "It took me way too long to make it here.  Many years ago I was at an event where Cibo was sampling food along with many other restaurants.  They were hands down the best food I had at that event.  I took their information and planned to go there for a full meal and never did.   I am so disappointed in myself that it took so long to get here.  I took my boss here for lunch on a beautiful Phoenix day.  It would have been great to eat outside, but we opted for inside instead.  It's an old downtown house converted, like so many awesome places downtown, into a restaurant.  It's cozy and unpretentious.  A+ for atmosphere. Just an fyi, during lunch, pizza is not served.  That just means I have to come back for dinner.  (Hopefully it won't take me another 5 years to do that).  At lunch, their delicious sandwiches and salads are available.  If you're not with your boss, you can also get a glass of pinot noir or chardonnay for $3.  I got a delicious lemonade and found a breakfast sandwich on the menu:  eggs, spinach, and ricotta on wood fired bread.  So good.  I got the fruit salad as my side which was yogurt, granola, and fruit.  My lunch ended up being two items I make myself for breakfast all the time, but elevated to gourmet deliciousness.  I can only strive to make my breakfast or lunch this great.  My boss got the pastrami sandwich and fruit salad and thanked me for bringing me here. Looking at the reviews, I need to come back for dinner, brunch, and dessert.  I can't wait and definitely won't.",

    "text": "Let me tell you about Cibo..  We went last night after seeing Kathy Griffin so we were both in dazzeling moods having laughed all night.. well leave to someone to suck the good out of your mood right quick.  We arrived at Cibo right at 10, they close at 11. The usual host and hostess sat next to the door chatting with some friends. The waiters were sitting at the large table in the front wrapping silverware and the bartender well he just ignored us completely. Finally one of the waiters asked if wanted a table.. no we would like to stand their and smell the pizza! Duh! So we asked him to hold one moment as we used the restroom real quick. Then when we came back he was gone and we were standing there once again being ignored. Finally the bartender made a huge sigh and asked of there were only 2 of us.. so he takes us to the left dining room and there are only 2 tables in there.. guess where he sat us.. right next to a couple that looked like they getting VERY romantic.. so they gave us crusty looks.. I then asked the bartender if we could just sit at the bar (I can appreciate someone wanting space, I didn't want to sit next to them either).. so he turns and looks to me, sighed again and said \"if you want\".. like those words were somehow causing his hair to fall out. So I said \"Oh wait, I wouldn't want to put you out!\".. he then just turned and stormed towards the bar.. the Mr stopped him and said never mind.. (he didn't want him waiting on us after that little episode) so we sat next to the couple.. they looked at us like we had just interrupted a marriage proposal and she hadn't quite answered yet.  So Im mad as all heck.. Ive been treated badly before but I gotta know you before you can walk all over me! Im SO over Cibo at this point and ready to leave but the Mr talked me into staying.. he has this special talent of calming the beast, not that I turn green and tear my clothes off or anything but my tongue has been known to be very sharp!   Waiter arrives takes our drink order.. nice wine list though very small.. he returns with the drinks and takes our dinner order.. antipasti, a rustica and a tricolore.. I asked if I could have prosciutto put on top.. you know what he says.. \"Ill ask the chef if you can have that.. he doesn't like changing HIS pizza's\".. I cocked my head at him (I think the vein in my forehead was ready explode) \"he doesn't like to change his pizza's\".. if you offer toppings on the menu for an up-charge, wouldn't you think they would actually give them to you? Talk about the dang pizza nazi! The waiter returns a few moments later or the 'chefs messenger'  (I think he was sweating) tells me that the chef has agreed to let me have the proccutio but only on a plate. Oh thank you thank you oh lord oh messiah!   Can you believe this place?  While the food was good the attitudes here has really put me off.. so the 2 stars are for food only.. the Mr and I will never come to this place again.. Cibo has officially been scratched from our minds. Oh, I will be sending this review to them as well.. that way if they even care, which I doubt, they will address not only the bartenders attitude (little scruffy guy) but the idea that the customer pays their light bill and tells all of their friends about the place!",

I ordered the Rustica Bianco Pizza and i believe he ordered the Diavola add basil. The food was delish however my Rustica had so much arugula on it it looked like a salad on top of my pizza. I'm talking a VERY unnecessary amount.... whatever, I just removed 3/4 of it. We had almost finished our first bottle of Pinot Noir before being seated so we had another along with dinner; it was a great compliment to the food. It was a Friday night and the wait wasn't more than 45 minutes, not bad in comparison to Bianco. All in all we had a quality experience.  The bar seating is very \"close quarters\" and if you're like me and you don't like strangers sitting in your lap I recommend imbibing someplace else.",

Fresh ingredients made my food hole want more. Try the Rustica pizza with basil. I find Cibo to be comparable to LGO and Bianco, but without the ridiculous wait you find at Bianco. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Cibo is a really adorable place, but I can't say that I think it is extraordinary.  The atmosphere and ambiance is totally five star, but too much goes wrong after that to give it an overall five star.    Food stuff:  I've been twice and both times I liked it, but it wasn't love.  We got the bruscetta plate and I wasn't really thrilled.  The traditional tomato one was the most solid choice, the bean one was strange and soggy and I don't eat pig so I can't comment on the third one (though everyone else seemed to enjoy it). The pizzas are pretty decent except that they lay out the toppings in a weird way, for example, if you order the vegetarian rosa pizza, if you like zucchini, it is all chopped up on two slices and so on.  It doesn't really make sense to top a pizza in such a way, to me.  I prefer draft beer over bottled beer, and all they offer is bottled.  I did enjoy a couple glasses of the Rossi Cabernet Sauvignon which was a solid wine choice.  Service:  The host/ess was a pleasant person, and the time quoted was less than we actually had to wait so that rocked.  While waiting, we attempted to get a drink.  The bartender was cool about getting our drinks in a timely manner despite the fact that it was busy.  Our actual server was super attentive at first and then lost for a good chunk of time as well.  Too hit or miss.    Cibo is an adorable spot with awesome ambiance but it isn't quite that awesome when it comes to food and service.",

    "text": "The things that stuck out for me with Cibo are the great staff and the warm, cozy ambiance that this little house-turned-into-restaurant provides.  Our waiter was on top of things, from taking drink and food orders, to bringing the cake out (we were there for a birthday).  He even said the menu items in a very distinct Italian accent, which always makes me giggle a little bit on the inside.  Tell me you've never said \"It's a me, Mario!\" in your best Italian accent.  When I went to the bathroom to wash up (the men and women bathrooms are single occupancy), one of the waitresses told me to just hop in the women's if it was empty.  Little things like this really help to give this place a cozy, inviting feeling.  On to the food.  The pizza was pretty good (though I found the crust to be a bit on the salty side), and the appetizers were excellent.  I had the geneva, which consists of basil pesto, potatoes, white onions, parmigiano and probably some other stuff that I don't remember.  But it was good.  My only minor complaint was that our table was a little cramped.  Certainly not Cibo's fault, since we were a party of 13,  but just something to consider if you go with a large party.  If it's cool enough outside, the patio would be perfect.",

    "text": "You cannot be disappointed of this place at all, whether it is the decor, the ambiance, and especially the taste of the food. The reason why I would give this a 5 star review is because they hit every expectation of a great restaurant on point. And this is based on both times that I have been here.  From the look on the outside and even inside, this screams romantic, but also gives a nice casual feel if you are going with friends or family. It feels like a welcoming place to almost anyone. And the wait isn't even too bad. During a time that they were busy, both a Friday night and Saturday night took only about a max of 30 min to get a table. Only thing is that they don't do reservations, but this isn't too bad of a wait in my opinion and compared to other restaurants. The staff is extremely nice and attentive when it comes to getting your order, bringing your food, and even refilling water and taking your plates back.  If you can't decide between what pizzas you want, you can easily do a half and half here! Just keep in mind that they charge for the more expensive pizza, but that makes sense. The Genova pizza is probably one of my favorite pesto pizzas there and elsewhere. It has potato on it as well, and with the onion makes such a power-packed combo on your palette. That was definitely the consistent one. Then I have tried La Noce and Da Vinci. I am a lot more of a fan of the Da Vinci because it is like a Margherita pizza with Burrata cheese instead I believe, but it's only because I am not a huge fan of arugula or nuts on pizza. Though even the La Noce was pretty tasty if that is what you prefer! The first time we came, the middle was kind of soggy, but we made sure to ask them to cook it a little more the second time, and the crust was much nicer. However, there were certain parts of the pizza where it tasted a bit burnt, but I think its because we asked for them to cook it a bit more to make the middle of the crust firmer. The Linguine Cacio e Pepe was one of the tastiest white pastas I have ever had! That is what brought the taste to a 5 stars. Never did I have a pasta that felt so light in terms of sauce but yet still be so tasty. I think there was some cheese and garlic flavor, but that is definitely worth a try.  As a vegetarian even, there were so many options to try from, and they don't do a half job at it. I loved coming here both times, and will definitely continue coming here again and again :)",

Our guests were enthralled by the 5 course meal prepared by the remarkable chef Guido and his staff.  I can't say enough good things about this place, from the authentic, beautiful paintings on the walls by the notorious owner Tony himself, to the delicious special handmade gnocchi pasta every Wednesday night; there is much to appreciate from such an authentic Italian restaurant. My favorite pizza pie is the Margherita - so classic and tasty. I also like the Diavola if I'm in the mood for some spice. Both pizzas are complimented nicely with their spicy olive oil which I like to drizzle on my crust for a nice finishing touch. Also, don't forget to add ricotta into your pie, you will not be disappointed!!!",

The gnocchi was excellent. The arancini was a bit off. It was more like sushi rice stuffed with cheese . Needed a little more flavor but presented well and wasnt awful.  The straccetti was good. Palline 2.0 was very good. And the peroni beer nice and cold and a bargain. The service was excellent and it is a beautiful outdoor spot.  We were indoors because it was 108.  It was a little hot in there but again it was 108 outside.  The only issue I had was when we came out  valet had set up and was blocking the passenger entrance to my vehicle in the handicapped spot. There is that space so a wheelchair can get through . The. Valet worker didnt seem to care.",

    "text": "The classic wood-fired pizza at Cibo is to die for. Not to mention dessert: Nutella crepes!?  I've been here twice for dinner with a couple of girlfriends and am eager to go back. Whenever I crave pizza, I crave Cibo. Both times I have been to Cibo, we ordered bottles of wine with our pizza and had dessert.  Pizza:  On the menu, the pizzas are separated into Rosse and Bianche (Red and White) pizzas. One of my favorite things about the pizzas besides the toppings and cheese is the crusts. The crust is soo soft, yet delicately crispy on the outside. The bread pulls apart perfectly.   *La Noce* this pizza is a red pizza, has mozzarella, ricotta, arugula, and walnuts. I probably would have preferred if the walnuts were chopped into smaller pieces, but nevertheless, the pizza was still scrumptious.   *Tartufata* if you love mozzarella cheese, this is the pizza you should order. It's a white pizza, so cheesy it strings up as you pick up a slice from the pie. The other ingredients are prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and a drizzle of white truffle oil after the pizza is cooked.   Wine:   The pizzas pair well with the wine. I usually get a Cab, and their Cabernet is amazing. The dryness of the Cab complements the moistness from the cheesy pizzas.  Dessert:  *Strawberry Nutella Crepes* Yes, I just had 8 slices of Cibo pizza, but I have an extra stomach for dessert, okay? These crepes were the perfect ending to an Italian dinner. I was stuffed and satisfied, but I can always, no matter what, use dessert. The crepes were so soft, Nutella warm, and strawberries so fresh!   If you are looking for a local pizza place in Phoenix/Scottsdale, please come to Cibo! You will not be disappointed.",

The toasted bread was dynamite. Onto, the main course. The magherita pizza was stupendous! Boiling hot, almost burned my tongue. Sauce, great. Cheese great. However, the crust was out of this world! I could have a whole plate of that. Absolutely terrific! I will be back soon again for it.",

Pasta is handmade at 4pm ready for dinner service. We had their margharita pizza and the pastrami sandwich- both were lovely! We then split a banana and Nutella crepe with a scoop of ice cream- it too was delicious. Thin and flavorsome. So good that I forgot to get a photo before we tucked in - so the photo only shows the remnants of the crepe  We will definitely come back to try their handmade pasta for dinner..",

The ambiance is really nice and is located near downtown. It's in a charming old house that also has a great outdoor seating area where lights strands are hanging from tree to tree. A great date night spot! If you come on the weekend they sometimes have jazz musicians playing outside near the fire pit.   When you're done with your meal, don't forget the banana nutella crepe!",

I looked over at the tab on the other table because they were closing out too and she wrote how much to tip her on their tab as well. Also, we asked her to get a straw and she replied \"sure\" she couldn't even say \"yes\" or \"of course\". We've always had pretty bad service at cibo but the only reason we go back is for the food.

My boyfriend and I shared the caprese salad and the Prosciutto Crudo pizza. They were both good, just nothing I would rave about.   While the service was prompt and friendly, it seemed like the servers were all racing through the restaurant without regard for the diners. It made for a hectic experience every time you got up from the table, especially with the close corners of the restaurant. Our particular server was nice and attentive. Something a little weird though, he was wearing a blue jumpsuit reminiscent of a prison uniform or a house painter. Kinda strange.   I would be happy to dine at Cibo again in the future, especially due to it's close proximity to my office. But I'm not jumping at the chance.",

    "text": "A month ago, I had no idea Cibo even existed. Hidden in the alleyways of Downtown Phoenix, nestled on the corner of a residential street, it can be easy to miss. But I am so glad I was invited to a friend's birthday dinner to celebrate here and uncovered the charming spot.   The place is actually huge, with beautiful string lights decorating a romantic outdoor patio and an interior that mimics your favorite cozy Italian joint, there is plentiful seating to enjoy the wonderful ambiance. The wait staff that served out table of 12-15 was so kind and extremely helpful. Our food was ready quickly and the pizzas I tasted were quite good. A little burnt dough on the bottom and very thin crust, but that wasn't enough to turn us off to the menu. Good portion sizes as well. They also brought my friend a crepe with an ice cream scoop on top as a free birthday treat.   I'd love to come back here and sit outdoors, experience the live music, and try more of the menu. Well done Cibo!",

The outdoor patio was well heated and comfortable. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the bartenders are terrible. They were not pleasant and not attentive. Note....it wasn't busy at the bar. At age 45 I can say I have been to enough bars and restaurants to know how a bartender should act. I pay $5 for a $1 beer and I am fine with that. When going out I kind of want to be welcomed and not a burden on the bartender. Overall, I would recommend the restaurant, but avoid the bar.",

Our waitress helped us with our wine selection and we decided on the burrata and calamari appetizers. - burrata app - delicious and recommended! Came with crunchy pieces of toast, burrata with balsamic vinegar, heirloom tomatoes with arugula and prosciutto.. can't go wrong with this one  - calamari app -just ok.. not going to rave about this one - calzone - the bread was soft and had char from the oven.. prosciutto coto, salame, mozzarella, ricotta filling was good too.. we also added mushrooms.. a solid choice I loved the environment at Cibo. Would definitely dine here again if I came back to Phoenix!",

I'm a girl with a pretty sizable appetite and these pizzas left me feeling full and satisfied. Ordered the magherita and added italian sausage to it. Everything was great, even the crust and I'm generally not a crust girl. Basil was fresh and the sausage tasted excellent. Our server was well-versed in the menu and knew exactly what she was talking about. She recommended to get half of the Di Notte and half of the Tartufata since my friend was wanting a pizza bianche but was unsure of what to get. She also hooked it up with this spicy oil to dip our pizza crusts in - yum!",

Last night, we order two pizzas, a red and a white. For the red we got half Funghi and half Capricciosa. For the white we ordered Dolce Vita and Tartufata. I thought I would enjoy the red more, but it was the two white ones that were the winners.   Both pizzas came out warm with burnt crust. The pizza is thin and a little soft in the center, which made for a soft, doughy crust. If I had to pick a favorite of the night, it would be the Dolce Vita. Creamy burrata cheese topped with spek, arugula, and a slightly sour/sweet balsamic glaze was the perfect combination. The other three were old delicious and flavorful as well.  To go with our pizzas, we ordered the calamari and assortment of grilled mixed vegetables. Both were average but I was disappointed that the vegetables were cold and did not taste grilled. I would not order either again.   Parking can be difficult in this residential neighborhood and the wait to get a table can get long as well. The outdoor seating area is beautiful with twinkle lights making the place sparkle  every night. Cibo is a great place for date night or just a casual get-together with friends.   What I recommend: - using the Yelp app to hold your place in line - Dolce Vita (pizze bianche)",

First of all, dining al fresco in Phoenix is a \"thing.\" A lot of restaurants have outdoor seating, and especially on nice, warm nights, it really adds to the overall dining experience. The ambiance at Cibo is amazing. There are lights strung in the patio, with the lowkey sounds of a live band in the background.  We were fortunate enough to be blessed with a nice, warm, May evening, so everything really worked in our favor.  The pizza at Cibo is amazing. Amazing. I can't emphasize that enough. We ordered the pizze rosse diavola (tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy salami and ricotta) and thepizze bianche tartufata (mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and a drizzle of white truffle oil). Both were delicious- savory, and packed full of flavor with every bite.  I'd come back to dreary Phoenix just to have another slice of one of these pizzas.",

I ordered the homemade roasted pork belly sandwich I think it was called after asking the waitress what her favorite dish on the menu was. It came out soggy she didn't offer ketchup or anything to put on the Fry's but I wanted malt vinegar her she provided it i'll sonic vinegar.

I tried the Tartufata pizza which has mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and a drizzle of white truffle oil after the pizza is cooked. I do appreciate the uniqueness of the pizza. HOWEVER, I do think that the crust was too dry. There is thin crust pizza and there is doughy pizza -- but this pizza seemed a little burnt? I did only try one pizza, so perhaps there are more tasty pizzas than this one.   I was a fan of the Nutella and Strawberries Crepe! Added a spoonful of vanilla ice cream on top! Yum!  Overall, I love the feel of this place when eating here at night. They've got pretty lights that sets the mood! Great alternative to Pizzeria Bianco's long wait lines!",

Pizzas: Out if the Salsiccia (red sauce) and Quattro Formaggi, we enjoyed the latter. You can taste the individual cheeses and the flavs all blend together perfectly, add some fresh arugula and life is good! Very Gorgonzola-ey. Our server was okay, kind of not really friendly, but our orders were perfect. Would go back just for the Nutella crepes. Valet..at 830pm they tell us the lot is closed, even though there are spaces(?) then when we left at 945pm and valet is open and parking cars. I don't get it. Just street park!",

Lunch was excellent. I had the Polpette (meatball sandwich) and my friend had the PLT, both with a side salad. My sandwich was one of the best meatball sandwiched I'd ever had. The bread was chewy; the meat was flavorful; and the cheese was melted to perfection. The portion size for the sandwich and salad was perfect.  The only thing this place has going against it is a lack of parking. I got there early so I could get free parking on the street about a block away (I don't believe in paying for parking when possible). There were meters and they have a complementary valet too for people willing to pay to park.",

I just recently ordered a lunch pizza with spinach, and they ended up forgetting to put it on till the last second, so when I bit into my pizza it was cold spinach.

The building setting is a house turned into an eating establishment. The service was good and the food was GREAT! In reality, 2 people can share a pizza and large salad and be good. Mr. B and are selfish and greedy so, sharing was not an option on the pizza situation; we did share the salad. The bill was a little hefty for 2 pizzas, a large salad and 3 glasses of vino but, you can't put a price on good food and service. The servers were extremely attentive, which was a huge plus. We will definitely be back for date night. Definitely a must try if you're in the area.",

For pizza, they'll let you do half and half, so each of the four of us picked out a pizza and then got to try one slice of each kind that we ordered. Super yummy. My fav was the Capricciosa while boyfriend was obsessed with the Salsiccia Con Patate.  We couldn't resist the dessert crepes and split two orders between the four of us. They're pretty large, so we didn't have to fight over the last bite. :) Nutella and mascarpone tasted like hot chocolate crepes (holy moly), and the fruit and mascarpone were yummy as well.  The ambiance is so cute and would be a perfect first date spot. Cute and kinda romantic without overdoing it!",

    "text": "After so many rave reviews of this place, we decided to give Cibo's a try. In a nutshell - the most underwhelming and flavorless meal we've had in a very long time. We should have anticipated what kind of meal this was going to be, by the dirty side plates brought to our table.  We had the Ostia salad - \"Romaine hearts tossed with our homemade chick pea dressing, topped with oven roasted herbed croutons, shaved pecorino romano, crispy parsnips and black pepper.\" Our romaine lettuce was spoiled, and rotting, the dressing had absolutely  ZERO flavor, and the salad overall just generally lacked any flavor at all. We then had the Procida pizza -\"Mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, asian pears, chopped arugula, goat cheese and black pepper.\" It wasn't bad, but it was just - eh. Again, lacked flavor. The goat cheese had no flavor whatsoever.   Our service was fine, but the girl who cleared our plates was very unprofessional. We let her know (and showed her) our rotted salad leaves, and she just replied with - \"Oh...sorry.\" That was it. Also, as she was clearing our plates, she put others' dirty plates on our table as she tried to stack ours. At that point, we knew our complaint was going to fall on deaf ears.   We've been to just about every pizza joint in the valley, and this was subpar, to say the least. I have no idea what all the hullaballoo is all about. We will definitely not be going back, which is disappointing, because we truly had high hopes for Cibo's after all the amazing reviews.",

We were seated behind some obnoxiously loud lady who was over-explaining to her friend how poorly her coworker taught K-12 chemistry...and was getting almost everything wrong herself (I have a PhD in molecular genetics, so the convo was like listening to nails scraping a chalkboard). That's neither here nor there. Our bad experience was enhanced by this.  So barely being able to hear myself think, I try to order a drink. The cocktail selection stinks for a place that appears to have an open bar. Plus, the waitress wasn't very helpful at all. She offered the peach bellini and then quickly retracted when she noted that they were out of the peach ingredient. Really?  Then trying my best to speak over Loud-Talker explaining that all you needed to demonstrate \"splitting atoms\" is two styrofoam balls and a toothpick...nuclear fission with toothpicks...I asked the waitress if they had anything akin to an Italian soda, or maybe a soda/ seltzer with a splash of vodka and some flavor. What I figured was a simple request was impossible at Cibo.  We left as Loud-Talker proclaimed that grade school kids don't need to learn chemistry, just general science...and we wonder why AZ's 8th graders rank #45 in the nation in STEM topics.  All in all, our waitress was aloof from the moment we sat down. She was either spaced out or just had no people skills. Having the atmosphere ruined by Ms. Loud-Talker was our own bad luck, but I still give this place one star for the poor service.  We left and went to The Vig next door. That place rocks.",

Next we ordered, a pizza margarita, pizza with spicy salami, a meatball sandwich, pesto salad, cous cous salad and a mele salad. The order took quite awhile to come out, but was definitely worth the wait. We all shared the food. And the reviews do not steer you wrong. The cous cous salad and pizza was amazing!

Meh.  2) lady has a pesto salad, could not taste the pesto and nuts very well. Meh.  3) I had the genova pizza which left a lot to be desired. Overwhelmed by too much cheese and an over-olive-oiled crust, I barely tasted the potato. Meh. 4) banana nutella crepe was excellent however.  5) service? Again, meh. Not terrible, not great.   If you come in with 3* hopes, you will get a 3* return, maybe 4* if they are not going during peak hours",

The mozzarella cheese was so delicious and paired perfectly with the prosciutto. However, as a personal preference, I probably would've preferred the waitress had told us that 1 order of burrata is enough for a meal.. for 2 people.   When the two pizzas were served, my colleague and I were too full.  We managed to each eat one slice of the pizzas.. then I just picked out the toppings for the procida pizza.  Well, I guess that says how good that combination is.   Definitely coming back next time, but 1) with a bigger group or  2) order less food",

So yes, of course after 700+ reviews, you're going to know the product is amazing. It just IS. I've not yet subjected myself to the wait of Bianco but I can't imagine it's leaps and bounds better than Cibo. Cibo is dreamy.  First off: I want to plan a fantasy fairy wedding party in their front courtyard on a cool spring night. It's just so cute and perfect! The twinkle lights and the wrought iron and the fountains and everything is awesome. Too bad both times we've been there it was approx 48403 degrees out. Sometime soon.  Second off: The food is just sublime. What I've partaken in...  - Sardegna salad - \"baby spinach topped with goat cheese, carmelized walnuts, and sliced strawberries with prosecco dressing\" The salad was dressed lightly, the walnuts were plentiful, the strawberries were JUICEAAAAY! A perfect way to start a lunch (along with a glass of bubbly)  -Genova pizza - \"mozzarella, homemade basil pesto, roasted potatoes, white onions and grated parmigiano\" HELLO, YES, I LOVE YOU. I saw a few reviews wishing the potatoes were thinly sliced, rather than the small cubes, but it just seemed perfect to me. The gooey fresh mozz and pesto were the perfect blanket of taste under the potatoes and onion. The crust is wood-fired perfection  -Their take on the Margherita: Simple and classic. That's all there is to say. Mine had the perfect amount of basil and again, the charred underneath of the crust was on point.  So why 4 and not 5 stars if the food and ambiance seems so flawless? I just got the sense (on both visits) that the staff just didn't care to be there. I understand, late lunch is kind of annoying time to be working, especially on the weekends. But I mean...on our second trip our server came to our table chewing on a mouthful of food. What? Wait times just seem a LITTLE steep., especially with only one or two other tables occupied at both times. One time we got bread, one time we did not. I just wish things were a little more streamlined and a little more careful. I love places that let the staff be laid-back and casual...as long as their job is done. You know?   In any case, it certainly won't stop us from visiting again. The food is too good to not! We'll make sure to make our next trip a dinner event in normal dinner times to see if things shape up just a few tiny notches in order to bump them up to 5 stars!",

Maybe I had too high of an expectation or something but I didn't think it was that special. Perhaps their pizzas would blow my mind.",

I guess it's not always on the menu so get it if you can. We also had the di note pizza and the nutella and mascarpone crepe. Everything was perfect and made with care. Thank you, mike and Karen for taking such good care of your customers! I will definitely be back.   I've been sneaking bites of my leftovers and they are still just as delicious!

We didnt want to wait, so we went some where eles to eat. Last nite we waited for about 30minutes.  We were seated inside. and quickly ordered. I had the omero salad, one firend had sausage pizza and a glase of wine, and the other had pear salad.  Ok food arrived promptly. my salad was good a bit on the small side for 11 dollars, but had lots of greens and onions, strawberries, and walnuts. it was good. my only complaint would be the candied walnuts........... couldnt even taste the walnuts too much sugar. When mentioned this too the waittress; She informed me that i could of requested plain raw walnuts and without any problem they could replace the candied walnuts with raw ones. That was nice to know. for the next time. My two firends both loved their food. I just thought mine and my firends salad were on the small side for 11 and 12 dollars. Other then that. Every thing at Cibo was very good. i recommend giving this establishment a try. I will be back. Just be prepared to spend 20 dollars or more. per person. Also depending on what time of day you go, be prepared to wait for a seat very popular with the  local folk. Lots of parties and groups coming and going. They serve wine and beer. not a full bar.  good place for eye candy of the both sexes. All ages here young and old.  Very nice atmosphere.  If if they offered organic whole wheat pizza they would get another star from me.",

    "text": "If someone tells you there just isn't good pizza in Phoenix, you can tell them they aren't looking hard enough. Tucked away in what seems to be a residential neighborhood, Cibo transforms its early 1900's bungalow into a legitimate contender for the best pizzeria in town. If you're looking for great pizza and a great ambience for date night, your search ends here.  The pizza itself is heavily Neapolitan styled, but has a few small twists on the classic VPN formula. It's most distinguishing feature is its tomato sauce, which features a slightly muted tomato flavor. Cutting down on the bright acidity typically found in Neapolitan pizza, the sauce allows other elements of the pizza to come forward. I don't know if \"sweeter\" is the right word, but there seems to be a something that takes out the highest end of the tomato bite. It'll be a hit with every type of pizza fan.   The other elements of the pizza do come forward and do not disappoint. I tasted the fresh mozzarella more on this pizza than on other local places. Cibo finds a good balance where the sauce is not overtaking the milder flavor of the cheese, which is perfectly melted without starting to brown. The basil on the pizza works just slightly better when the cheese is brought to the front of the flavor too. It's just a really tasty combination that just works on this pizza to slightly different level than on similar pies.   The crust was probably the weakest point of my visit. Of the two pizzas I tried, one was overcooked and one was undercooked, which was strange. I like a good amount of char, but one half of the pie was dark brown/black. The undercooked pizza had the beginnings of leopard spotting but was too soft on the bottom. Looking around the room, I saw plenty of well-done pizzas, so the oven was working well that night, I just got a couple of duds. The flavor of the crust was pretty average, and I felt like there was a chance for more flavor development. Maybe better texture would have been enough to satisfy me though. I will note that I've been here many times and this is the first time I've had this issue, so I won't ding the star count (though this visit would have been a 4/5). I'm also not personally a fan of pizzas where the center of the pizza is wetter and soggier- I prefer a crispier crust throughout. The pizzas at Cibo trend closer to soggy than crispy in the very middle.   I tried the Margherita on this visit, and I've had other offerings with different cured meats on top. All of them excel, but the Margherita is my favorite; it's possibly my favorite Margherita downtown. The antipasto board is also fantastic, as was the house bread and Nutella crepe dessert. Service was average but the ambience is wonderful, especially if you sit outside where there is frequently a live musician.   Cibo might not be VPN certified, but their style of Neapolitan pizza is a must-try for Phoenix pizza lovers. I've yet to be disappointed by anything I ordered off their menu. If you love pizza, you owe it to yourself to stop by. You'll be treated to one of the highlights of the burgeoning pizza scene.",

    "text": "You want great authentic Italian food at a decent price? This is the place. Every pizza on the menu is terriffic (I think we've tried them all by now) but our favorites are the Tartufata (white pizza with white truffle oil) and and Diavola. Or maybe the Quattro Formaggi and La Noce. We ALWAYS begin with the Burrata starter. More than enough for two people. In fact, I'm tempted to ask if we can get a 1/2 order. The wine list is modest and won't make you wince when you see the prices. If you're still hungry, the Fresca from the Dolci menu is simply amazing. The fruit crepe is MORE than enough for two people. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Chef Guido make 3 homemade pasta dishes, usually around $13-15 per plate. Amazing stuff. The service and servers are second to none. All very friendly and helpful.",

    "text": "I stooped in for a Friday lunch with my boss. Parking was a bit of a pain as usual. The only table available was in direct sunlight and it kept us squinting though our entire conversation.   The lunch menu consists entirely of sandwiches and salads. I was in the mood for some hot food, this along with my love affair of cheese lead me to try the hot multi cheese sandwich. I did not know what to expect as on the menu it sounded like a grilled cheese sandwich.  My arrived on a plate with a small side of Cesar like salad.  The salad had a nice topping of shaved Parmesan, and the sandwich had a generous amount of micro greens in addition to the cheese. The micro greens gave the sandwich a nice bitterness to contrast the fattiness of the cheese. The crunch and slight char taste of the brick oven chibata style bread tied the entire thing together.  My bosses meal came on a old chipped plate, as if the kitchen had run out of the nice contemporary plates. This was troublesome as it was against health code. His meal of a cold meat sandwich and fruit salads looked appetizing as well.    I look froward to returning at night to try their pizza again.",

Located in a small house inside of a beautiful courtyard area, you can enjoy the sounds of live music while paying a bit more than you should considering the quality of the food.  Ordered a pizza and it was pretty \"meh\". Thin, not very tasty, and not crunchy even though you'd assume it would be considering how thin it was. Service was also pretty lackluster. My drink was empty for majority of the meal and I waited to use the restroom for a good 15 minutes because there was a waitress taking her break in there. If you're not a big fan of good food, go for the atmosphere. It's a cute little place. The valet was awesome since it's a pain to park in the area.",

The pizza here is truly authentic to Italy and is not overly sauced, cheesed, or garnished. I love the simple and tasty flavors and wood fired pizza. Same room for dessert, the nutella and marscapone crepe is just about the most amazing thing you have ever had. Reasonable prices and good happy hour selection.

The chickpea dressing is different, but in a good way.  Think runnier hummus.  The fried parsnips were a unique touch and the croutons. wow.  The highlight was the Tartufata pizza.  White Truffle Oil. That's all I'm gonna say there. I detest mushrooms so I had my half without the fungus.  The prosciutto was crispy and the truffle oil made the pizza decadent and rich.

I usually end up going in the evening time-the ambiance is always right, the lights in the trees and the gentle breeze.   The thin crust pizza is just wonderful! I love the Procida, Rustica, Margherita for all right reasons, perfection! I've had a sample of the homemade pasta that too was just wonderful.  BUT if you want to know the real reason I go...I go for the Nutella shake...I mean the Frappe alla Nutella. What a great piece of heaven on this Earth! I'm not even kidding you, I'm hooked!  I've been there when its busy but game plan ahead of time and get ready to have all of your senses say thank you!",

The Nutella and banana crepe is also a MUST, so save room for dessert! Love their outdoor seating, but inside is charming too. They have a nice private eating area too if you have a special event. I will definitely be hosting a rehearsal dinner there when my wedding time comes! It's truly one of the culinary bests in the Phoenix area, I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys good food, wine and company!  The only thing I can say though is that on Friday and Saturday nights, they fill up quickly! But it is definitely worth the wait! And normally you don't wait as long as they quote you :)",

    "text": "Cibo itself is a oxymoron. Very cozy but large. Very romantic but busy. I will explain that later. This Italian restaurant is that but much more. On the corner of North 5th Avenue and West Filmore. At night, you will see a house lit up with strings of white lights and the sound of a guitar playing sweet melodies.  Getting there was a small challenge for me. Not being from Phoenix and not being familiar with side streets. My main route was using the freeway. Which I am not a particular fan of.  This night, Friday, was filled with a lot of ambulances, cop cars and fire trucks with lights and sirens blazing. One incident, my wife counted around 12 of these emergency vehicles going the other way on the freeway at the same time. I just pray that they all got there on time to help the people who were in need. Getting closer to the restaurant. You can see the tall buildings of downtown. We were following the maps app but a lot of the streets are not well lit. So we missed a street or two. Luckily we did find the restaurant. Again the strings of white lights and the guitar music were a good indicator that we were here. Plenty of parking on West Filmore street. Besides the front patio dining. They have a small bar once your inside. The bar itself holds, at most, 9 individuals. A good selection of bottled beers, wine and shots of different cocktails. My wife tried a limoncello drink that she thought was real good. Too bad she got the last one so she couldn't order another. What makes this restaurant cozy but large is the inside of the restaurant is broken up into smaller rooms. So you never see everyone who is dining there. You can just focus on your present company and the meal you are sharing. This also explains the being romantic and busy part. Waiting for your table you see servers and patrons going back and forth. It's not until you get seated into one of those smaller rooms that everything starts to slow down. The crowd that eats there is a very diverse crowd. From hipster guys and gals to men in suit and ties and women in dresses. Young and old come here. And they come for the atmosphere but mainly for the food. Great Italian fare. Pizzas, pasta dishes, colorful salads. The food is amazing. House chop salad is great, 3 pairs of different prepared bruschetta is great and the bolognese sausage dish that I had was so good. It was all delicious. If you come here. You will not be disappointed.",

First of all, though;  If you are on a gluten free diet and want pizza YOU HAVE TO GO HERE!  And now:  The staff was brilliant, up to and including making sure our water never ran out.  The atmosphere outside was festive without being overwhelming. The inside was cramped and too loud... but if you line the party atmosphere it's 199-% you.  The food was perfectly done and arrived at the table right on time. The beer was wonderful (I had an oatmeal around from a brewery in Tucson). At one point Ton thought he had served me the wrong beer, so he was going to buy me what I had ordered. I checked and it was what I had ordered... but he bought me another round anyway.  My girl ordered the calzone - which was huge, fillings in a perfect balance and perfectly done.  I ordered the Diavolo, I believe - gluten free.  If you are on a gluten free diet and want pizza YOU HAVE TO GO HERE! I would t have known it was GF. It was incredible. Damn near miraculous.  Not cheap, but worth every penny. 2 people with all the trimmings will hit you for a Benjamin... but when the prosciutto and tomatoes are imported from Italy you know it's an awesome value.  EASY 5 stars. Good job, Tom! :)",

We were seated in the small room to the left as you come in and there was a big noisy party next to us which made it difficult to have a conversation without shouting (a turnoff), but made for a lively, happening atmosphere. The grape tomatoes on the house salad were so sweet and fresh tasting that even my tomato-hating son urged me to try them. The 3 Bruschetta had even more tomatoes, as well as a bean mixture that was tasty, and prosciutto for the third. The pizza crust was crispy, just like I prefer it, and the sauce with just enough spice to give it a little bite.  There is outdoor seating which seems like a lovely idea on a cooler evening.",

I believe I went here w my sister like the first year they were open or was it just me not remembering any details I have no idea.  Anyway we got here first time pretty early or it was holiday so they weren't open yet or something like that years ago. Then we came back and everything was pretty much taken and it was so busy. I loved the decor and the feel of the place that puts you into a storybook or some other space and time.  I also thought I would see a ghost of some kind, but it all went well ( this is not Hollywood either).  So I reserve this place especially in my heart for its old wooden floors and the decor and lots and lots of flowers.  Hmmm that is what I remember anyways, half the stuff is prob made up. #reviewno4",

Price is very reasonable for the quality/quantity and atmosphere.

We had the pasta, I highly recommend either - and the servers were very knowledgable, super friendly. Found the perfect bottle of wine to go with our meal from Sicily, and the salads were unbelievable. Limoncello was mind blowing, the chef makes it himself and shows a lot of attention to detail. This place does NOT disappoint. We felt like we had an amazing meal - really an experience - for a very reasonable price tag.",

    "text": "When my husband and I were looking for a place to host our casual rehearsal dinner in May, we knew we wanted to take our small wedding party to one of our favorite local spots. Cibo came to mind, and we discovered their wonderful, private carriage house.   It's located right behind the restaurant, and it's perfect for groups of 30 or less. It's everything you love about Cibo--delicious food, attentive service and cute ambiance. Inside, the Carriage House features exposed brick walls, wine racks, a cool bar and art created by local artists. Outside, there's a private patio with string lighting, cozy seating and a fire pit. Oh, and there's a private bathroom, too.   Michelle at Cibo helped us coordinate the evening, and she was super helpful. We chose a menu that featured an antipasti, a couple of delicious pizzas of our choice, and a sweet nutella crepe for desert. The food, of course, was amazing, and the service was even better. We had a dedicated bartender/server for our group of 20. She was awesome, and made sure our wine glasses were never empty, which was critical for our group of lushes.   The cost was also really reasonable. There was a fee of $50 to reserve the private carriage house, and the cost per person was a steal. The in-laws were hosting the dinner, so I don't know the exact price, but I think the food was around $25-30/pp, excluding beer and wine.   If you're looking for a casual place to hold your next private event, I highly encourage you to check out Cibo's carriage house. So, so awesome.",

One weak link is a male server who consistently spaces out and gets orders wrong. I am a fan of people who don't need to write down the order, but then when you get multiple things wrong- it's not so bueno. Luckily the food is so good, it eclipses occasional sub-par service.  I recommend the Diavola pizza with anti-pasta to start. Enjoy.",

After reading the rave reviews on yelp, my family and I decided to drive out to it from our hotel in Scottsdale.   We obviously came for the pizzas, but were told that we would be unable to order anything from the \"dinner menu\" although both yelp and their menu stated that the lunch menu ended at 2pm, which is when we got there. Our waitress told us that those were both incorrect & if we had checked their actual website, we would see that it is actually 3pm (as if we weren't thorough in our research and must triple check). We explained to our waitress Erika that we were from LA California & if they would be able to make an exception. She said no, but upon further requests and asking to see a manager she left and did not return long enough for us to realize that service is clearly not a priority at this eatery.    My sister cleared the bill for the drinks and we left without a single apology or accommodation from the restaurant. Very disappointed.",

    "text": "I am happy to update my very poor review of Cibo from several months ago and get on the fan bandwagon with all of my fellow Yelpers. I also want to thank the proprietors who took my previous review seriously and encouraged me to give them another opportunity. I wish it hadn't taken me so long to get back to Cibo (life tends to get in the way!!) and believe me, it won't be long before my next visit.  We returned for lunch today and were seated right away. The place wasn't near as busy as the last visit because many had Columbus Day off work. Our server welcomed us promptly and took our drink orders. We decided on hot sandwiches: Sicilian sausage and pulled pork. OMG - they were soooo delicious!!! The pork was lean, tender and in a wonderful spicy (but not overly) sauce. The Fontina cheese was a great touch and tasteful. The bread...ummmmm good. I'm tired of getting sandwiches on so much bread that you can't open your mouth wide enough to bite - the grilled saltimbocca bread was so good! The sausage sandwich was super flavorful with the perfect amount of peppers and onions. Again, the bread complimented the sandwich.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it took a while to get our bill. While we weren't in a hurry, the server walked by our table a couple of times and didn't check in on us. As I mentioned the place wasn't overly busy at all so I would have expected a tad more attentiveness. But overall, the food was outstanding and the quaintness of the little house made for nice ambience.   I'm not a fan of eating crow, but if I have to, I will. I bet the chef at Cibo could even make crow taste phenomenal!",

Each of us ordered a pizza and I also had the house salad which was amazing. The pine nuts added a nice touch. The Margherita pizza was as close as the pizza in Rome,Italy. The Latina was not my favorite, the slices of tomato had no flavor, but my husband enjoyed it. My son ordered a spicy one which I am sad to say I don't remember the name but it was great! My son's girlfriend got the pizza with anchovies and capers.....she loved it but the rest of us thought it to be disgusting. Tasted way too fishy. Their Pinot Noir was excellent. All in all it was a great evening. live music was nice too.  They offer valet parking as well.",

All that disclaimer being said, go to Humble Pie and get their Fig & Prosciutto pizza. It really is the exception to the rule. Plus, there's the not burnt bonus, and crust I'd consume. It was hard for me to admit out loud that the cacophony-pizza craze had a desirable item for a guy who would still like to enjoy his food if he's having to pay for it in duplicate all for the atmospheric air of trend.",

And the pizza was flavorless (the sauce was terrible, and the veggies were not much better). Sorry to not jump on the love bandwagon here, but I can't do more than 2 stars (two visits, two strikes).

    "text": "I've been meaning to update this since my last update. After posting my last update, I received a bit of a nasty email from someone affiliated with the restaurant, scolding me for not notifying them of the burnt pizza and saying they *probably* would have given a free dessert if I had (\"probably\"?! Wth?). So, whoever you are who wrote to me - first of all, it's not my job to do YOUR job. There were enough people involved in the making of my burnt pizza that it should have been noticed before making it to me. Second off, the waiter initially forgot to put the pizza order in, so he had to come back and ask me what I had ordered. So I wasn't too keen on complaining considering it was difficult to get the d*mn pizza to begin with. Thirdly, my toddler was eating it and I certainly would not have ever considered taking it away from her. Anyone who has ever eaten with toddlers would know this. Which leads me to my last point. Eating with a toddler at a restaurant is not easy to do. The last thing I would ever do is make the experience longer than I needed it to be. WTF.   So, thanks for your nasty email. And here's some advice to you: the next time you receive a less than stellar review from someone whose hard-earned money pays your salary, respond like this: \"Dear customer, we are so sorry your experience was below our standards. Please see the manager the next time you visit so we can take care of you.\"  If I had received an email like that, you better believe I would have been back just for the customer service. As it is, I will never spend another dime there.",

The wait was only 30 minutes and the pizza was so much better than the well known and televised local competition (let's just call them pizza B). The ambiance was fantastic and it was the perfect date spot for the wife and I to sit back and relax. They even had a local musician playing live music to even better the mood for dinner. Service was fantastic and every part of our dinner made the wife and I happy about our dinner choice.  Let me start by saying everything I ordered was perfect.  The ostra salad was plenty as a starter for the wife and I and it was fresh with fantastic tasting ingredients. The diavola spicy pizza with ricotta added was the best pizza I have ever had. My wife's white pizza was fantastic as well it had mushrooms greens and pork I believe on it The banana creepes with Nutella and ice cream was oh so yummy. The fresh made iced tea was also unique and fantastic.  We left with a 3 course meal for around $60 which is not bad at all for the experience and food we received  I would most defiantly recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

    "text": "Wow -  I must admit, Cibo impressed me more than I anticipated... even after reading the 100 reviews that came before mine!  I had plans to meet my friend and future yelper Leslie F for lunch on Monday, and when she suggested Cibo since it's near where she works, I jumped on it... after all, I'd never been and I'd been wanting to try it for ages!  Maybe lunchtime is the time to go, as we didn't have to wait for a table and our service was right on... Sara was our waitress and she was just the right amount of attentive; she gave us time to peruse the menu per our request but brought our iced teas out right away.  They stayed full too... thanks to the attentive rest of the staff.  I felt like I drank about 5 gallons of tea (it's really good by the way).  I opted for a vegetariano sandwich served hot with a house salad.  The saltimbocca bread is worth breaking the wedding diet for, and the grilled zucchini, roasted red bell peppers, grilled eggplant and mozzarella are just the right amount of flavor in between the fresh bread.  Each bite was uhhhmazing.  I love when restaurants choose not to skimp on the quality or the quantity.  The salad was the perfect compliment as well.  Leslie chose the Sicilia salad.  She is a Cibo regular but this was the first time she had this particular salad.  It comes with organic mixed greens, orange slices, goat cheese, and toasted almonds with Grand Marnier dressing and a side of fresh bread.  She seemed happy with her order as well.  The other salads and sandwiches looked appealing as well.  We skipped dessert although Leslie told me that the mini crepes they serve are fabulous... I'll have to return to try those as well as the pizzas one evening for dinner.    I know Jared will also love the bungalow style house and laid back ambiance that Cibo offers in addition to the fabulous menu and service we received.  I can't wait to share my new find with him!",

It has a really nice feel to it almost like you are eating at someone's house. I had a rigatoni special with fresh pasta, marinara sauce, and ricotta cheese. It was excellent. My friend had a pizza that was obviously hand made with care. The wait staff was very friendly and patient and everything was fresh and served promptly. This is a wonderfully place with great food and atmosphere. The only reason why I did not give them 5 stars is because I wished the portions were a little bigger. This may not be fair to them because I am a big eater. Great place, I'll be back.",

If you like real Italian/Naples style pizza, this is your place. While they also do a specialty pasta dish a couple days during the week, pizza is really the heart and soul of the place.  I like to dine here when the weather is nice and we can eat outside. On Friday and Saturday nights, they have a live jazz band outside. This can be a very romantic place to go and I highly recommend it for a date.   All the deserts (except one) are using Nutella as an ingredient. I am not a fan of Nutella, but I must say the Pellani 2.0 is most excellent and only about $6. What is it? Imagine donut holes being served in a little metal basket with four wooden spears. You spear the donut hole with the little stick, then dip it in the ramekin of Nutella to your taste and enjoy! or, feed each other - very romantic.  The prices for what you get are very reasonable. Parking can be a challenge or you can use their complimentary valet.  Lot's of stuff to do downtown very close to this place (Film Bar, Angel's Trumpet, Crescent Ballroom, Breadfruit bar...too many things to do in this area that I can list here).  Highly recommended, but very limited menu. If you like REAL pizza, in a unique and romantic atmosphere and very affordable. I only wish I knew about this place sooner.",

A surprisingly amazing combo. The crust of the pizza always seals the deal. Fresh with a hint of smoke from the wood firing oven. The customer service here has gone down in the past year or so. The restaurant is in a historic house with original wood floors. The front patio is also great to eat on when weather permits- it is too hot out right now. I prefer going there in the spring or winter when they have heaters turned on. The trees on the patio have little white lights strung through them giving a romantic vibe. This would also be a fun place for a girls day out, birthday dinner or any special occasion. When relatives come from out of town, this is where I take them. The most recent downside I've found to Cibo is their breakfast/brunch. I ordered an omlette- forgot the name of it, was topped with tomato sauce and some spinach. The egg tasted old and the sauce wasn't warm on top. I paid around $10 for a plate I picked at. I recommend only lunch or dinner here, which are excellent in terms of quality, selection, price and ambiance.",

I didn't give it five stars because I like my pizza  with a little more tomato.  The other reason, but like the first one it is  a bit subjective, is that the menu selections for dinner are limited - basically pizza.

Bianco is about a 3 hour wait, and while I'm not saying that it would have been wonderful, I was able to come to Cibo at around 5:30 and get in with my party of 4 no problem.  Walking in, your greeted by your host, right behind her, a bar, and then a glimpse of their coal burning pizza oven.  When I saw the pizza burning right next to the coal, I knew I was in the right place.  After a couple of cold Peroni's we ordered the buffalo mottzerlla with prosciutto and baguette.  It was wonderful.  The cheese is sourced from Italy, and I have to say it was the best I have ever had.  Stringy, soft, lightly salty goodness.  For our main courses, we shared the spicy pepperoni pie, while my in laws opted for a Greek pizza with artichoke hearts, feta, ham, and olives.  Both were good, but the pepperoni was a must have.  The crusts were really something special, with a nice crisp and a slight burn from the oven.  For dessert, we had some creaps.  Don't leave here with out having the nutella and bananna one, it was to die for and went really well with my last few sips of wine.  As we were leaving, there were about 5 couples waiting in the court yard.  I'd say to insure a seat, come down around 5:15 and you'll get in fo shiz.",

As of late I've developed a taste for the True taste of Neapolitana style (real italian pizza)...  I have become quite expert in making my own neapolitana style pizza at home too, but when I do eat pizza out Cibo's is my very favorite.  It is set in a converted bungalow for a very homey atmosphere.  The proprietors Tony and Karen Martingilio and their son Michael Krasner are the most gracious and caring hosts I've ever encountered.  Guido Saccone is the Italian born and trained pizzaiola.  He crafts fine neapolitano pies my favorites are the margherita and sausage.  They also have great salads, antipasta, and at lunch time great sandwiches on homemade bread.  If you still have room, defintely try one of the crepe and Nutella deserts.  My favorite is the one with bananas.  Cibo's also has a carriage room suitable for private parties and can hold up to 60 people.  Also on Tuesday and Wednesday they are offering pasta specials homemade and handcrafted by Chef Guido.  So for a great all around dining experience you should check it out!  Tell em Lloyd sent ya!",

We are not from Phoenix, but visit often. We have heard of the mythical, never ending line that Bianco possesses, but I couldn't imagine the pizza being any better than this, maybe it's the selection they have, I don't know. My daughter savored the marscapone and nutella filled crepe that she got for making a happy plate! But it was much to small to satiate all  three of us without wanting to order 3 more, and at $5 a piece, we'll just stop at the store and get the ingredients. Overall really good dining experience, a little pricey but worth it.",

(If traveling by public transportation), don't be discouraged by the slightly awkward walk from the light rail station (Van Buren) to the restaurant (5th and Fillmore).  Cibo sits right on the corner and is built into an old house.  Visually pleasing -- lowlight, original artwork -- I liked the ambience.  It was refreshing to get away from the contemporary desolation that is downtown Phoenix.  Granted, my friend and I dined on July 4th (a quiet night for many restaurants), but the service was wonderful.  Our server struck up conversation and seemed genuine in recommending her favorite antipasti, pizza and wine/beer combinations.  The antipasto speciale was full of interesting flavors and the Prosciutto Crudo pizza was simple yet tasty.  Great dough and black label meat is always a plus.  I stand for beer with pizza so the server pointed me to a micro brew that's right out of Tuscon (forget the name, but second of the four).  Since it was a mellow night, we were allowed to lounge outside on the patio with the Nutella and strawberries.  I probably could have gone without dessert (considering I had a few slices to take home), but my sweet tooth said otherwise.  Overall a really pleasant and peaceful experience.  I also appreciated the server's comment that contrary to popular belief, Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco are not rivals.  Rather, they endorse each other in front of guests.",

    "text": "ah yes another review. Went to Cibo with a large group of 14 current and past co-workers to hear our co-worker and friend play guitar there. Everything was great at first. Nice  service, nice atmosphere, as allways, good food. There was another large party on the patio with us and it was still quiet and relaxing. My co-worker brought his dog and it was cool that they allow that. Then I looked down and realized it was 7:30, and I needed to go. Some people were going to stay and drink more, but I had to go. So I asked the server if she could put $20 of our bill on my card. Um, I guess not. Get this- they DONT SPLIT CHECKS, and only take 4 debit/credit cards per bill. So not only could I not leave until everyone paid, but we were going to have a hard time paying the bill +20% added gratuity b/c most of us ( being 40 and under) only carry credit/debit cards. The. best part was when I asked her to put $20 on my card she looked at me and said \"What do you want me to do with the card?\" hmm, I want to pay for my food lady. GEEZ sorry. ALL of this on a Monday night. Apparently we were $2 short ( go figure with 10 different people) and she actually brought out a calculator and tossed it at us... treated us like we were bums.The servers attitude alone was rude and ruined for us.I will go back (if I'm allowed) as the food is good and the service, usually, is good too.( At another point she said she couldn't go inside and check on something b/c \"its too busy in there\". Hm sorry your place of work is busy on a Monday night during a recession. Don't worry, I doubt it will last for long.)",

Chris Bianco had better stay on his side of Central because Cibo is bringing some serious wood-fired heat with their two-person pizza kitchen stashed away in a restored home on the corner of Fillmore and 5th Ave. Lunch and dinner only here (for breakfast pizza, check out Pie-sano's) in a unique pizzeria that makes me feel like I'm eating at home. The pizza is cooked up in a wood burning oven (like Bianco's) so expect that same taste. They are smaller, typically for two people, and can range from a classic white pizza to the strangest concoction your mind can dream up. The seating is limited and there is a crowd perpetually from 11am to 10pm. Don't even try on First Fridays or Suns game nights. Cibo is out of the way but easy to access from 7th Ave. Parking is limited and only getting worse. Be careful crossing the street, the corner is dark and I drive fast.",

    "text": "Decided to make the rare drive out to downtown Phoenix to check out a highly recommended restaurant from my friends called Cibo. I am a self proclaimed pizza connesiuer/snob and this place hit my fancy right on the pallet. Started off with the 3 pairs of bruchetta, the bread was toasted perfectly and the toppings were plentiful. Followed that up with the Diavola; spicy salami pizza! Fantastic! Fresh mozzarella, simple red sauce topped with great tasting spicy salami and cooked perfectly in a wood fired brick oven. Unfortunatly I didn't have any room for the great selection of crepes which judging by the looks at the table next to mine looked out of this world. I only gave Cibo four stars cause unfortunatly our server was a space cadet. The server assistants were on the ball filling our waters cleaning up the dirty plates and delivering the food, but our waitress failed to notice our empty cocktails, make any return trips, and offer up any desserts. But all in all I would return. Keep up the good work CIBO!",

Lastly, for dessert we had the banana nutella with ice cream. Delicious.  I will definitely be back more sooner than later!!  Oh yeah, did I mention that the atmosphere is adorable!  I cant wait for the weather to become nicer here in Phoenix so I can sit outside on their beautiful patio.  Cibo is my new favorite restaurant.",

    "text": "took my mom, grandma, and the mrs. here for the kickoff to my birthday weekend. my family doesn't experience much downtown (they're *gag* scottsdale) so i chose cibo as the perfect introduction to the wonderful cuisine and atmosphere cen pho offers.   went at 6pm on a friday night and the wait wasn't bad - maybe 15-20 minutes. it wasn't too crowded in there so we managed to huddle around the bar and have a drink and chat for a bit before we were seating. i had almost forgotten how absolutely charming this place was - you feel very at home inside, and it makes for a comfortable meal and dining experience.  although the service wasn't as good as i expected it to be - our waiter disappeared for long periods of time and didn't check on us very often - it wasn't bad enough to the point of knocking the place down a star.   first up came the bread and olive oil, and when we asked for butter, we were denied because they didn't have any. what restaurant doesn't have butter? we ordered two salads to share - the house salad and the pear salad. both were superb. the large chunks of parmigiano  on the house salad were tasty as was the balsamic dressing - not too much and not too little - just right. we went with two pizzas, a red and a white. the capriciossa and the other one i forgot the name (it had fontina cheese and pepperoni, and it's not on the online menu). the white pizza was definitely  my favorite, as i am not a fan of pizza with a lot of toppings. i just can't get over how delicious these pizzas are - the crispy wood-fired crust and the cheesiest of cheeses - cooked to perfect. we couldn't leave without desert, and settled on the nutella and fresca. both were to die for; i prefered the fruitiness of the fresca to the somewhat overly sweet nutella.   oh how i heart your pizza, cibo. no need to try pizzeria bi-crappo, you treat me and my taste buds perfectly.",

When it came to the pizza - ummm, I expected better.  The toppings were pretty good (we ordered 3 different pizzas) but the crust fell short.  Thin crust which when done right is excellent,sadly this wasn't one of those times. I have a couple server pet peeves and one those peeves popped up at Cibo;  throughout the dining experience (and no matter where you are, whether it be In-N-Out or Le Cirque, it should be a dining experience) the server takes no interest in your table other than to take your order and deliver - then suddenly out of no where, 5 minutes before he/she is about to present the check, this new person emerges.  He/she now has a personality where absolutely none existed before and they want to know about your needs.  Now I really understand when the restaurant is so busy that you're lucky to even recognize your server, but if there isn't a wait...C'mon.",

    "text": "I recently tried Cibo for the first time, and I am really impressed.  It was suggested by friend, but I'm a little leary of Italian and Pizza places here.  I have my own favorites, and I've been let down by a lot of other restaurants.  Came in on a Tuesday without a reservation, place was busy but not packed, got a table right away.  They've got a cute little patio outside, but I opted for an inside table.  The restaurant is a remodeled house in an historic neighborhood, and nicely done.  Cute and cozy without being kitschy or smarmy.  Okay, I lucked out, Tuesday is their fresh pasta night.  Had a choice between a Tagliatelle dish, or Gnocchiette with fresh tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil.  Made fresh from scratch by hand, and clearly the staff was enthusiastic about it.  Chose the Antipasto Speciale (the smaller one of two sizes), the Il Notti Pizza (from the Bianche pizza offerings, but we added a little sausage), and the above-mentioned gnocchiette.  Fan-freaking-tastic!  Super-generous Antipasto, with bright flavor to everything on the plate.  Not one misstep.  Pizza was rich, spicy, lots of cheese and salame and sausage; crisp yet chewy and in no way soggy.  Gnocchiette:  Perfect.  Texture, flavor, presentation.  Not doughy, not acidic...just perfect.  Add two glasses of Fuedo Arancio Syrah for 7 bucks a glass, and I'd have a hard time recalling a better Italian experience in Phoenix.    I'll be back.",

    "text": "Had to write in response to Tom H.  I'm a regular at Cibo, even though I live 25 miles away. It seems to me that this was a table that was just not going to be happy no matter what. Without exception, every time I've gone to Cibo I've been warmly welcomed by both the owners and the wait staff and the level of service they provide is laid back and exceptional. They're not hovering over your table waiting for you to take your last bite so they can whip the plate from under your nose but they are discreet and attentive at all times. There is a family atmosphere in this restaurant and just watching how much the wait staff love their bosses and what a good time they seem to have at work makes me jealous I don't have a boss like that!  I have brought countless friends and family to Cibo for all sorts of occasions and am made to feel like a VIP every time I walk throught the front door. As someone who eats out quite a lot and has been in the service industry, albeit many years ago, I find it amazing that a group of six would argue with a busy waiter about splitting a check six ways, how embarrassing. What is the problem with just putting in cash for your share when you know you're eating as a large group? Or even splitting it evenly between three couples on credit cards. And complaining about a 20% gratuity? Show me any good restaurant that doesn't charge an inclusive gratuity for parties of 6 or more. As for the comments about refills-always have my water and coffee refilled as soon as it gets low-and the portion sizes, well I've yet to bring anybody to Cibo who can finish a whole salad and pizza, the portions are more than generous. Overall I feel I'm a discerning diner who has high standards and I've found a real gem in Cibo, so excuse me if I'm a little overprotective but I feel that Tom H's review was completely unfair to the amazing ambience and fabulous staff at Cibo.",

    "text": "Cibo's pies are ambrosial.  Wood fired, thin crusted and a chewy crumb all combine to produce a pizza that will rival any of the famous New York eateries, including Rays. Their pies in a word are simply delectable.  Situated in a 1913 ranch house, your seating options are limited to:  * Small bedrooms, appointed similarly to a 1913 small bedroom; about a half dozen     tables with about 15-20 people to a room. If you want an intimate experience, these    rooms aren't the place. Despite their talking softly, I still overheard the next table's    plans for In Vitro, and since my wife was absent any form of communication, I     can proudly say I know just about all there is to know about In Vitro fertilization.    Thanks bunches to you two for speckling my lunch with all your sperm speak.  * The bar area is also small but quaint and nicely appointed. I'm guessing you need     to time your arrival with the exact moment they unlock their doors if you have    any designs on bar-flying it.   * The patio area, where no misters abound, is certain to transform your date into     a sweaty Betty just moments after being seated. Perfect for old hippie chicks who     still sport patchouli as their primary cleansing function.  Cibo's parking is limited. Your choices are street parking or street parking. And remember, you're in downtown Phoenix...the same streets playing host to every ass-wart of societal humanity, so be sure to lock your car, set your alarm, and put your valuables in the trunk.   Overall, Cibo wins high praises for its fare, despite its quirkiness, lack of parking, and low sperm count patronage.",

The waitress was very short (not in length), not attentive, and fazed from her job. Water glasses came 2/3 full, which was weird. I found the pizzas to be just overdone enough to have an off-putting bitterness. And I did not like the tiramisu. It was just thick heavy cream without the nice texture of freshly soaked ladyfingers.    So I don't know if I'll be back..maybe with a smaller group on a not-so-busy night.",

    "text": "Cibo is a pizza place that faithfully replicates the Italian experience of eating pizza. It is *not* a place that tries to do deep dish or thick(er) crusts like they do back in Chicago. Lou Malnati's will always rule the day in that department, with Gino's East running a close second (and Giordano's a close third!)   But as far as straight-up Italian pizza is concerned, Cibo is as close as I've had since coming back from Naples.  First, their pesto salad: Excellent. Fresh greens, intensely flavored tomatoes, and sheets upon sheets of parmaggiano reggiano, which one can never have too much of. The basil tasted fresh, the olive oil had character, and they didn't spare on the pine nuts.  The pizza came soon after. We had the salsiccia con patate, a pizze bianche with potatoes, mozzarella and spicy sausage. Once again the ingredients were top notch and melded nicely, the sausage in particular having a great, complex flavor. The mozzarella melted perfectly and wasn't rubbery or greasy.  Ah, but the crust. It was thin and slightly charred on the bottom, like it should be. The dough had some \"give\", and chewing through the toppings brought an interior that was soft and had excellent texture. It should take two hands to eat this pizza. Very well done.  The interior of the restaurant can be loud, (very loud, depending on the intoxication of present company) and they're usually very busy. We had to wait 45 minutes for our table, and the weather outside was certainly threatening to pour at any moment (although it didn't). \"Urban\" also seems to have a different connotation, since the restaurant sure seems like it's in a low-density, suburban part of town (that happens to be a mile away from downtown Phoenix).  But the wait was worth it, and I'm giving a thumbs up to Yelp for drawing me to an excellent pizzeria.",

There was plenty of extra seating and live music, too, which made the wait more enjoyable. The patio ambiance was so nice and pretty. I'd like to check out the inside next time.  Our waitress recommended the burrata appetizer, which was awesome and filling, but light at the same time. We ordered the Diavola and Tartufata pizzas at other Yelpers' recommendations. Of course added ricotta to the Diavola- also after reading reviews. They were both amazing. The crusts were light and crispy, the toppings were flavorful... even leftovers the next day were great! (and you WILL have leftovers) It's very hard to pick a winner, but I might go with... the Tartufata? But try both! Our waitress even told us we'd picked the best red and the best white pizzas they had.",

    "text": "Finally tried this place, and I definitely get what all the fuss is about!  I really like the atmosphere at Cibo. I was gonna say it's a \"cute little place\" because that's how it feels, but I think it's a lot bigger than it actually appears (as I was leaving I noticed that the patio really does have a lot of seating). It seems like there's a lot of separate little rooms each with a few tables, which I kind of like because even though this place gets busy you still can carry on a conversation with your party without feeling like you have to shout over loud noise.   As for food, I can honestly say the calzone I had was one of (if not THE) best I ever had. I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to calzones, but the one at Cibo isn't quite as \"heavy\" compared to most places (the crust surrounding the cheese & meats is thinner), but it's HUGE & very filling. The lighter crust (& cheese) doesn't make you feel like there's a huge rock in your gut when you're finished even thought you just finished something so mammoth (and yes, I did finish my calzone). The other people I was with all had pizzas & they all found them to be yummy. I should note (and I'm pointing out my own stupidity here), the calzone at Cibo is listed on the menu w/the pizzas (they only have one calzone listed). The pizzas at Cibo all have special Italian sounding names. I actually thought I was ordering a pizza called the \"calzone\" and planned on sharing it w/the others in my party who were all sharing pizzas. I was a little surprised when I got an ACTUAL calzone (I know, silly me). Anyway, my friends had more than enough pizza to share with each other and I ate the whole calzone myself!  My friends ordered a couple of desserts, which I didn't plan on trying, but decided when in Rome, why not! I had a couple of the donut ball things dipped in nutella (sorry, don't know what they're actually called), and they were heaven. A couple other friends split whatever the crepe w/fresh fruit & whipped cream is called, and well, I probably ate at least half of it. So, yeah...  The service at Cibo is a little slow, but it gets crowded so that's understandable (I was here on a Friday). Our server was very friendly & helpful, though. I'll be back!",

Although there was a larger party seated next to us, it did not distract from the over all experience. I was very pleased, and look forward to returning again!",

    "text": "Cibo has a great patio, a few quality happy hour offerings, and the exciting promise of gluten free pizza. Sadly, the good things about it didn't make up for the not so good things. On the plus side, the polenta fries were fantastic and the wife was a big fan of the gnocchi. On the minus side, the pizza was relatively tasteless (like it needed salt) and I'm pretty sure it made me sick. I don't know if it was the gluten free option or the cheese, of which I rarely eat, but I woke up the next morning violently ill. My wife ate the same thing and didn't have a problem, so perhaps it was a fluke. Either way, it just didn't excite us the way the Yelp reviews did. Much sadness ensued.",

The pizza also was burnt. I love brick oven pizza. It's just that it's not supposed to be burnt. There is an art to it.  I'd maybe try it again, but after trying some of the other places in the area.  Service was super, super slow.  We waited for our check for like 25 minutes while our server ignored us and attended to a larger party instead. She also wasn't too attentive with drinks, etc.",

Ask for the crushed red pepper infused olive oil - it is glorious. Dump the crushed red pepper on that spicy sausage.  Heat lovers dream.",

We had heard a lot about Cibo and how great the pizza is, and it did not disappoint! We were out in the little carriage house behind the main restaurant due to the event being a private one, and it was so stinking cute! We had an open bar so we were just drinking the basic white & red wines they had, but whatever they were they were tasty! We were also happy to find that they carry Deschute's Fresh Squeezed IPA which is by far one of our favorite beers. For the food, we had lasagna, the meat & cheese board, a mixed salad, several types of pizza, and nutella crepes as a final treat! Basically, we were absolutely STUFFED by the time we left, but it was because the food was so good we wanted to keep eating it even after reaching the full point haha. I can't speak much to the cost of things, since again we were lucky enough to have all of our drinks & food taken care of by the hosts, but I can absolutely say that we will be giving Cibo another try for an upcoming date night!",

    "text": "I visited this dainty little restaurant on what looks to be a not-so-nice area of Phoenix built into a house with an adorable front seating area while visiting family in AZ.  My friends were raving about this place while we sat at Gino's East in Chicago dining on what I like to think as some of the finest pizza around.  So for someone to suggest there was good pizza, in Arizona, I had to see it to believe it.    The inside is literally the front of a house with a bar area immediately to your right, a table for a large group set front and center, with the kitchen behind it, and bathrooms that in any other setting someone would have viewed the cracked toilet seat and floor tiles as grotesque, but here, the added bouquet of flowers and wall mirror made for a rustic, inside-someone's-personal-house, geriatric feel.    We sat outside, as the temperature had cooled down to a manageable, sunless 90 degrees and my friend's fiance was meeting up with us with her puppy (yes it's dog friendly). The outside patio was separated into two areas with the main walkway down the middle.  The floor was made up of mismatched bricks, some jutting up, with small two to four seat, wrought iron tables strategically placed around the center where a tree was unruly growing out of the brick and mud.  They had decorated it with a string of white lights which gave the atmosphere of the perfect place for a date.   Everything at Cibo is cooked in their fire-grill oven, and they mostly have wine with a few specialty beers brought to you by a rather odd waiter.  We first ordered an appetizer of Schiacciata Maremma, half without eggplant and our little sandwiches came with just enough time to gobble them up before my friend's fiance arrived and even knew we ordered.  The crunch of the bread from the wood-fired oven with the melted cheese holding the vegetables in was the perfect start to a fantastic meal.  We then ordered pizzas, the Pizza Rosse Vegetariana and I believe my friend had the Di Notte pizza, adding potatoes.  The crust was thin and had just the right amount of crisp, but still strong enough to hold the massive amount of toppings.  I wouldn't compare it to Gino's East, but overall, it was a pretty good, healthy pizza.  It felt almost homemade.    We finished the meal off with a nutella and strawberry crepe which was to DIE for.  There are few restaurant chef's that seem to make a crepe the correct way, thin, less like a pancake, and still strong enough to hold together your ingredients. They managed to get the crepe and ingredients just right and we walked away extremely full and satisfied.  Not before her 3 month old puppy went to sit on the neighboring tables lap after they picked her up.  An extremely chill, relaxing atmosphere.  I highly recommend finding this Phoenix gem while you are in town.",

I had very high expectations for this place because everyone is always talking about it and telling me how amazing it is. I finially got a chance to try it out for the first time this past weekend.    So we ordered the prosciutto pizza.. I wasn't that impressed as I would hope to be. I felt like there should've been more on there. Maybe some basil, veggies, mushrooms? Something? It was just a pizza topped with some prosciutto.  I also got my favorite type of red wine. Pinot noir. Delicious. I definitely love their wine here.   It really is a perfect spot for a date. Super romantic. Disappointed about the pizza we got but I'll definitely come back to try the others. =)",

No idea what it was called but I it was fantastic! Cream filled mozz ball with tomatoes, bread and of course balsamic reduction.   If I lived closer I'd be broke! Nough said.",

I know to order more next time, but all in all. It was soooo delicious!! My new favorite pizza spot. Thanks cibo.",

Not only does the restaurant have the feel of Italy but the food is simple amazing. My wife and I enjoyed the place so much that we are taking six other friends and introducing them to Cibo. I have mixed emotions about posting this. The upside of the posting is that it allows others to read about the restaurant and then indulge in its fine food and atmosphere, the downside to the posting is that the word gets out and it becomes harder and harder to get a table. Oh well , the wait is worth the reward.",

Everything was authentic, not from a box, and had fresh ingredients.    We sat on the patio and it was secluded, quiet, and romantic.  A perfect end to the work week.

The moment I walked in, I thought I'd be going back frequently. But the food is very so so. The pizza crust tastes good but is far too chewy. The meatballs (we got them as an appetizer) were too large and too uneven in consistency. The meat didn't appear to have been blended thoroughly with whatever other ingredients they used. And everything was a bit cold. This all might be okay in the far flung reaches of Mesa. But if you are going to be down the street from Bianco and Pomo, you need to get this stuff right.

Lol when we picked up our food we were expecting pizza boxes. They were sandwich boxes! What a let down!  We hoped that the saltimbocca will be deliciousoso!!   Shared half of the hot Vegetariano (grilled red bell pepper, eggplant, zucchini and mozzarella) and the  porcellino (pulled BBQ pork and mozzarella). I enjoyed the vegetariano because it was all veggies and much lighter than the porcellino - which was siting on the heavy side. Also comes with a side of house salad of greens, pine nuts, red onion and shavings of cold cheese.   I guess I'll have to try the pizza another time....for dinner. :)",

With a range of vegetarian options that taste just fine, CIBO is a go-to spot in downtown Phoenix if you're looking to get out of the hotel but not venture too far into the desert.  CIBO feels like one big home. Well, that might be because the restaurant exterior looks like a home. My server was a bit quirky: he had jokes, but also had a knack for stopping by our table at the most inopportune times. He reminded me of the mom calling about the squirrels in the GEICO commercial.   The food at CIBO is affordable: I paid $14 for a plate of pasta (linguine cacao e pepe) and $11 for a margherita pizza. I wouldn't recommend the pasta - it was as plain as a white t-shirt. The microgreens on top were a nice touch, but out of place. The pizza was tasty, but I avoided eating the crust.  I would return again if I were staying in downtown Phoenix, but the food wasn't particularly memorable. My strongest memory of CIBO was of the two people making out outside the restaurant as I was leaving. The food? Good enough, but not as memorable.",

    "text": "You mainly come to Cibo for the pizza which I personally feel is arguably better than pizzaria bianco without it even really being their main specialty, it's just what people know this place for! I split a pizza and a pasta with a date and had the calamari appetizer.   The appetizer was not that impressive to be honest. It was steaks of calamari about 2 fingers width fried up. The batter itself was good but I think if you're an Italian place you should have calamari that's rings and tentacles.   Their pizza here is incredible. It's about a 12 inch serving good for and appetizer or splitting along with another entree. The pizza is thin crust that's dough while also maintaining a thin and crispy feeling. Pretty much perfect brick oven pizza.   Their pastas are extremely well done and the server said their pasta is all made in house which you can truly taste.   The wait staff here is incredibly friend and nice, the atmosphere is very cozy and intimate though you can definitely bring a larger group if your heart so desires.    Parking is extremely easy with complimentary valet. Definitely recommend this place.",

I'm a huge sucker for an awesome, crisp to perfection, deliciously stuffed, delightfully tasteful crepe & I will tell you this, they are HARD to find.  Before calling it a night last night, I didn't want to take the chances of missing the opportunity to enjoy one of these babies before our departure back home. So, I called in an order around 10pm (luckily they close at 11 on saturday nights). I ordered the banana & nutella crepe w/strawberries added to it. I didn't want the 'a la mode' as I didn't want the ice cream melting on the drive home.   O.M.G.......This was delicious! I HAD to open it up in the car to see what it looked like (wish I hadn't, it made me hungrier) it looked amazing! As soon as we got back to our rooms, I couldn't help but start indulging it. It was perfectly crispy on the outside with drizzled chocolate and powdered sugar on top, the inside was even more of a delight being completely stuffed!   I'll definitely be back, you've won Cibo. Let's see what your entree's have to offer next.",

On my most recent visit I asked them to bake the crust longer to make it crispy.  It was soggy again.    Please note one point of caution regarding the other reviews of this restaurant.  This place may be quicker to get into, but it is most definitely NOT anywhere near the caliber of Pizzeria Bianco.  Would every pizza chef in town who has a James Beard Award please raise their hand?  On March 18th I received this message from Karen Martingilio:   Dear Ted, thanks for giving us a couple of tries, everyone has their opinion about what they like in a pizza, in Italy they use a knife and fork, we make our crust more soft and chewy more Italian style, and that does not appeal to everyone, however to imply that our other reviewers are just coming to us because the wait is shorter, or that we take less pride in our product then others is somewhat mean spirited, I m sure you didn t intend to insult our dedicated chef or our restaurant but unfortunately it could be misinterpeted by other Yelpers, you are intitled to your opinion and so are our fans on Yelp, thanks again for your imput, Karen Martingilio  Yelpers, as Karen notes above, I am entitled to my opinion.  Her email does not change my opinion in any way.",

The service is horrible and our waitress didn't seem to listen at all. We ordered some bruschetta. It was ok at best. We then said we were probably interested in trying the lasagna, but to come back in a few more minutes. We told her we changed our minds on the lasagna and wanted to share a four cheese pizza. About 5 minutes later, we get lasagna. She said sorry it came out so fast and the pizza would be out in 10 minutes. We decided it wasn't such a huge deal and we could take that home. However, it is totally rude for one person to get their food and not the other person. Who does that?? We then get our pizza.  On to the awful food. Like I said, the bruschetta was ok. Postinos is 100 times better. The lasagna, we just boxed. My boyfriend ate it the next day and said it was horrible. I make much better at home, and this was some extra special dish they had. The pizza.......oh my. It SERIOUSLY tasted like I took a bunch of cheese and melted it in the microwave. It was some of the worst pizza I have ever had.  I will never go back. Horrible service and horrible food. I don't get why they have such good reviews. Maybe because it is in downtown and its a cool place to go hang out. Go to Angels Trumpet.",

We ordered 4 pizza's for the table .. they all were under cooked soggy  a real mess.. The taste was bland..  Our waitress seemed like she was somewhere else.. would disappear a lot.  It was almost impossible get water refills..  oh  I forgot mention ... the pizza had a burnt flour taste.. which means they need to clean there ovens..

    "text": "2 words--not impressed.   I called ahead to see if we could make a reservation for our party of 3 as we had show tickets and was informed that they do not take reservations for parties smaller than 8. I was assured however that we should have NO PROBLEM being seated promptly at 6PM on a Saturday evening. Our show was at 8PM so I figured a 2 hour window should have been ample. It's just pizza--how hard can it be? Boy was I wrong.  Well guess what? The restaurant was P.A.C.K.E.D. We waited 20 minutes to be seated which wasn't too bad for a Saturday evening at a popular spot but when the expectation was already set that it \"wouldn't be a problem\" to get seated, it was annoying.  The hostesses were friendly and pleasant tho so it was hard to be outwardly annoyed.   We were finally seated inside and proceeded to wait some more for a server to come by and take our drink order. 10 minutes passed when I flagged down a busser to ask if we could get someone to take our drink order. A few short minutes later, our server arrived and so it began...the glare. The \"can't you see I'm very busy and you'll just have to wait\" glare. Sigh. Because we were seated in a smaller room, it was very noisy and our server REFUSED to speak louder to share with us the beers they had available. We aren't deaf...it was just loud. She wouldn't move closer to the person asking, she wouldn't speak louder, nothing. And then she walked away...and 10 minutes later, she passed by to inform us that the bartender was backed up and it would be a few more minutes but didn't stop long enough to take our appetizer or dinner order. Fortunately, the busser was VERY on top of keeping our water filled so at least we had SOMETHING to drink. Drinks finally came out and we had to ask her to take our appetizer order. Again the \"can't you see I'm busy\" glare. It was 30 minutes after seating that our appetizer finally came. We ordered the Burrata which is fresh mozzarella with proscuitto and toast. Although the mozzarella and proscuitto were delicious, the toast was burnt...visibly burnt. I'm not even sure why she put it in front of us that's how burnt it was. But, we couldn't send it back because no one ever came by to check on us.   More time passes and everyone in the room has received their appetizers, entrees, and have moved on to dessert except for us. We are still waiting for our entrees and are watching the clock. At 7:20, I flagged down our server who gave me the glare again to ask her if our pizzas were coming out soon as we had show tickets. Instead of \"I'm so sorry for the wait, let me check on that for you\" I received the \"I'd call you a bitch if I wouldn't get fired for it\" glare and this time the glare was accompanied by a lecture that there was a party in the Carriage House. I had NO idea what the Carriage House was or why a party there had any effect on our meals but our server had already huffed off before I could ask. So we googled. Turns out Carriage House is part of Cibo where they serve large parties. Good to know...would have been better to know back when we were getting seated about these delays but so be it. Our pizzas arrived at the table at 7:30 PM. We have now been at Cibo for 90 minutes. Our show was at Comerica and was starting at 8PM. We scarfed down that pizza as fast as we could and Ms. Glare left us the check at least when she dropped our pizzas.   After all that waiting, rudeness, and more waiting, honestly? I've had better pizza at Picazzos. This pizza was thin looking but was doughy. The sausage on the Salsiccia was sparse at best. The Rustica wasn't cut properly so we were fighting with the proscuttio. Both were just ok. It was really very anti-climatic.   Cibo was a major disappointment. Considering all the rave reviews here on Yelp, I am that much more disappointed that our experience was so dismal. I wish I could tell you our server's name. If she said it, we sure didn't hear her and I'm pretty sure she didn't say it. There are lots of other options downtown. You might consider not going to Cibo unless you go with a larger party because apparently that's the only way to get good service and properly prepared food.",

We were told by some locals to come here rather than waiting in a two hour line for the other favorite pizza spot in the area.  the atmosphere really made the dinner!   It's an old house redone as a restaurant... we sat outside and there were twinkly lights everywhere and a great jazz musician playing live music in the background.   Our group of 10 ordered 8 different pizza's plus a couple of the special pasta dishes.  Both pasta dishes were out of this world, and the pizza's were tasty and above average.  (but i'm super picky about my pizza's) It was a great meal and a great atmosphere, and next time I visit I would go back.",

    "text": "After reading all the favorable reviews, we decided to make reservation for our party of 7 one month in advance.  The restaurant is located in downtown Phoenix to what looks to be a residential neighborhood.  It is ranked as one of the top first date places and the ambience is very romantic.   It reminds me of one of those restaurants that you stroll across with a beachfront dining in some romantic resort town.    We ordered a total of 5 pizza's, 2 appetizers, and 3 desserts for our party.  The pizza's were phenomenal, much better than the other place that has a wait of 3 hours.  The pizza's that stood out were the one with truffle oil and a red spicy sauce with ham.  Sorry, I don't have the names of the pizza's as I let my friends do the ordering.     Be sure to save room for dessert!  We ordered 3 crepes (nutella with banana, creme cheese, and fresca).  Each was delicious.  Upon leaving we were stuffed, but left with the satisfaction that this was one of the best pizza's we've ever had.  The service was great,  our waiter provided some really good tips and recommendations.  We'll be back on our next Giants Spring Training trip!!",

Every pizza I've had from Cibo is excellent.  The decor and atmosphere is fantastic and perfect for a romantic date.    They have a great outdoor area and on a nice night when the weather is right, you can't ask for a more perfect/romantic setting.    Just so you know, if you are in the mood for some pizza for lunch, this isn't your place.  Pizza is only served at dinner and I think it's only sandwiches and salads for lunch.

The unassuming location made me feel like we had found this hidden spot only the lucky few knew about. The service was spectacular. Our waiter was attentive, water glasses were always filled (much appreciated since I was not used to AZ heat), and we felt welcomed. The waiter gave us some much needed guidance with the menu since everything listed sounded unique and amazing. I decided to go with a pizza that had potatoes on it and was thrilled with my decision. Both of our pizzas were delicious and we enjoyed some suggested wine.   I thought the meal couldn't get any better... but then we ordered the nutella and banana crepe. Seriously it was one of the best crepes I have ever had. We sat outside and the atmosphere was charming and inviting. I felt as though I was sitting in my own garden or backyard. They have twinkle lights in the trees and you feel like you should be on a movie set. Next time I am in Phoenix Cibo will be my first stop!",

    "text": "We came for dinner and it was a cute place. We weren't expecting it to be in a home, but it added to the charm. We ordered the burrata appetizer which had a ton of the cheese but not enough bread so ordered extra bread. Last time I had burrata at a restaurant the cheese was warm which I enjoyed... it was cold here but that is fine. I'm not sure what the norm is for serving it.   Sadly, we didn't enjoy the pizza very much. We ordered it half \"Tricolore\" and half \"Tartufata\" -- the tartufata side was heavy on the truffle oil and a bit too strong/oily for me. The tricolore was okay.  If I were to come again (if I ever visit Arizona again) I think I would try the pizza Rosses over the Bianches. The bianches just sounded fantastic (these had no sauces).  Our waiter was nice. I felt bad for him trying to explain the special as it took well over a minute to describe just the soup. It was amusing as I'd hear him at each table explaining it, but what a mouthful! It sounded fantastic and we were very tempted to order it but we already had too much food.",

We were seated promptly. Waited promptly. And got our food promptly.   We ordered a pizza (you can choose two \"flavors\" so it's half and half) and the meatball sandwich with fruit salad. Everything was so delicious. Prices are reasonable. And this place is clean!  There is no pasta served during lunch. Only dinner. And there are more pizza options and dessert options during dinner.   We want to go back already! I recommend this place!",

    "text": "What a cute place. It's a wood fired pizza restaurant in the middle of a residential neighborhood, really random!  The pizza was very good, a lot better than the huge waits at Pizzeria Bianca.  I have never had their pizza so I can't compare, but this is really good pizza with no wait. Saturday at 5 pm, walked right in and got to sit outside.  I haven't seen the inside so I have no idea what it is like in there, but outside is really nice, the birds even walk right up to the table and then fly away.  They have \"root beer\" it's not root beer, it's sarsaparilla marked root beer, it was one of the best sarsaparilla's i've had though but I would not really have it again as I prefer real root beer.  The salsicca and genova pizzas were both great.  Salsicca was salami and cheese and the Genova was cheese and some dark greens.  Both were really good tasting and not burnt.  I also had the Cioccolino which is a thick chocolate liquer shot.  It was strong but pretty good, but super thick, almost too thick.  I must say it's hard to find normal pizzas here, which speaks to the authenticity, but be careful if you bring picky eaters.",

I would skip the fried dough pieces. The fried rice balls are excellent, and the drink prices are really good. Oh, and the little salad that comes with the sandwich is perfection.

    "text": "Cibo has a really cool patio area - neat to sit outside.  We had a table near the entry walk - as the crowd built up, some of the people waiting to be seated were kind of crowding our space (I had the seat closest to the walkway).  Other than that, nice environment.  (Be prepared to walk upon arrival - we had to park a couple of blocks away - nice evening, so no worries!)  We came because I was told Cibo had the best gluten-free pizza crust.  (I tasted it, and it tasted very much like the not-gluten-free crust - not at all cracker-like as most places seem to have).  This is one of those upscale wood-fired places that has pizzas with all kinds of things you may not associate with pizza toppings (e.g. prosciutto crudo, capers, artichokes).  That's great for some folks, but when you've got a teenager with coeliac, it would be great to have simple pepperoni as an option.   I went with the aforementioned prosciutto crudo topping for my pie.  It's added after the pizza is cooked (makes perfect sense).  However, it's also added after the pizza is cut, so you have to cut/tear the prosciutto to fit the slices (doesn't make perfect sense).  My pizza didn't have a terrific 'upskirt' and the gumline on the crust was pretty high - I think they rushed it a bit.  My wife's crust had better leopard-spotting.  It was nice that they had crepes available for dessert, and that gluten-free crepes were available!  The crepes were a nice finish.  My iced tea only got refilled once (turned out to be a blessing, as it's a longish drive home).  Also, great 'hipster watching', if that amuses you.  I'm going to lump Cibo into the same category as Pizzeria Bianco - if that floats your boat, this probably will too.    As for me?  Not my thing... overrated/overpriced.",

The reason why I'm only rating one star is because of how unprofessional the staff/ hostess is. I tried to place a pick up order four times in the last month and I was put on hold for over 10 minutes each time.. when I decided to hang up. I even tried to call back, and I was put on hold again. Their line is obviously busy, since they leave costumers on hold until they've had enough.   If they're trying to lose business they are doing it right because me and family won't come back. There are so many authentic Italian pizza places in Phoenix, Pomo just to mention one. Cibo clearly doesn't want our money",

    "text": "Yum, yum, yum! This place was SO good! I had been to Cibo before, and loved it, but after trying their life changing Neapolitan-style pizza, I felt so compelled to write a review! Me and my two friends shared the La Noce pizza + one of their homemade pasta specials. We were told they only serve these dishes twice a week (& that's when you know a place has fresh food)! Everything was spot on, and we had no complaints or regrets!   The location itself is as cute as it gets. The first time I came here I sat outside and enjoyed every second I spent on their adorable patio. This past time I was in, I sat inside, but still thoroughly enjoyed my surrounding environment! Our server was very friendly, patient, and helped make my friend's birthday so awesome. At the end of our meal, she brought us a Nutella crepe with a candle on top! The crepe was so delicious that we decided to try one more dessert... Because what the heck! We got the Frutti Di Bosco crepe with mascarpone filling. The flavor was simply intriguing and all I have to say is YOU HAVE TO TRY IT.   Thank you Cibo for a memorable evening. Everything was amazing, and I will continue to come here for years to come!",

The crepe was perfectly fluff- not dry nor soggy. The amount of naturally sweetened fruit was a great pairing with a side of vanilla bean ice cream. We came as a group for a surprise birthday party and the ambiance during the evening was just stunning. There was a live performer, lights were on, the temperature out was just right with some heated lamps. The waitress was very helpful in recommending dishes and making sure everyone was accounted for. Dishes came out all at the same time and the waitress even brought out and helped slice our cake. Amazing service and food!",

The setting was perfect: candle-lit outdoor setting with some easy listening live music playing in the background of our conversation. The pizza is delicious and fairly priced, given the atmosphere and ingredients (some said to be shipped from Italy). Our server was kind and genuine. Cibo was everything we'd hoped it would be, and maybe more.",

The staff were nice and fairly attentive. It's got a nice laid back vibe.   We started off with a Caprese salad and I think that's why I rated this place just average. For me an Italian restaurant shouldn't ruin a caprese salad but this one was just not good. Something was seriously missing - maybe a little balsamic drizzle but it lacked all of the fresh flavors I was hoping for. The pizza I ordered on the other hand was so good. I was really bummed I couldn't bring the rest home (headed to a concert after dinner). It was the Di Norte and had a nice kick to it so you if you like a little spice in your life this is the thing to order.   I would come back here again but it's not at the top of my list. Great if you want to sit outdoors and enjoy the nice temperature and good conversations.",

I have been here several times, all for lunch, so I have NOT tried their pizza yet but the sandwiches and salads they serve up for lunch are nothing short of phenominal! On my last vist I tried the Ai Spinaci, which is a garlic lovers dream sandwich topped off with wilted spinach and toasted prosciutto! All I hear is great things about Cibo's pizza, so I can't wait to finally give it a try!  The restaurant is a beautifully converted house in a historic downtown area, but that also equals very limited seating inside. They have a great patio with more than ample overflow seating outside, but it's pretty worthless during the summer days. The servers here are all friendly towards the customers, and work as a team to make sure the lunch and dinner hours run smoothly!  Also, the crepes are amazing! We never had any intention of ordering dessert but our server insisted on bringing us a complimentary crepe with the assurance that it'd be worth it! WE LOVED IT! Make sure you save room for dessert!",

We had the Di Notte pizza and there was wayyyyyyyyyyy too much Gorgonzola in it. Couldn't taste anything else except that. $17 pizza and I had half a slice.  Also got the Friday special which was a truffle ravioli... it actually was pretty good, BUT, came out cold- which for $18 is absurd. All that said, the Nutella crepes were pretty good which is why I'm giving this 2 stars.   All in all, I will not be returning. Simply for the fact that I know numerous pizza places in the valley that I can spend $30 less and get 30x better pizza.",

The restaurant is basically a converted house with string lights on the trees, and I totally recommend dining outside with the live music.   Once I got over how beautiful the place was, I turned my attention to the menu. The pizzas are split into reds and whites, and you can do half half. We got the half and half with la noce (red) and Genova (white). The former had walnuts and arugula and was pretty good, but man the Genova blew my mind. I can still taste the Genova - the flavors were literally so tastefully put together. The potatoes, pesto, and white onion blend together so well for a light but satisfying pizza. The only thing I'll say though is that the pizza was extremely thin/kind of soggy to the point where it was difficult to pick up and eat. You could eat it with a fork and knife but ours was just a little too soggy. Still yummy though - just wish it was a bit firmer!   We also got the linguine cacio e pepe, and it was equally as good as the pizza. The presentation was so nice and it tasted just perfect. Honestly probably one of the best white pastas I've had.   I'd 100% recommend this to anyone looking for a date night spot or even just a nice dinner outing with friends/family/colleagues. It's not overly expensive for how good it is. I look forward to coming back here and trying the wine pairings!",

They forgot our pizza (gave it to another table) and we waited another 20 minutes for that. Our crepes took 20 minutes from ordering. All in all, it took 2 hours to leave the restaurant when it could have taken 1 hour.  They gave us a little discount, so that is why it is not two stars. When you are having kitchen/service issues, it is always a good idea to update your table and provide transparency into what might be going on. Instead, the server avoided any eye contact with us. Their pizza was okay, but it was soggy and not properly cooked because they rushed it, when the server realized that we had never received it. Their pasta special was 10/10. Delicious.  The arancini was horrible. The cheese inside of it was cold and it was flavorless.  I will probably not come back, unless friends drag me here.",

We were a little bummed to find out they don't have pasta during lunch, but understandable since it is handmade daily. We ordered the pesto salad, two pizzas (salsiccia and di notte), and the polpette saltimbocca freddi. The pesto salad was surprisingly delicious! I'm normally not a fan of ordering salads when I'm eating out because they aren't normally super special, but this particular one was topped with delicious sharp Parmigiano cheese and lots of pesto dressing. The salad was so flavorful! The pizzas were definitely my favorite orders. The salsiccia is a tomato sauce pizza with mozzarella and sausage. My favorite was the di notte pizza, which is a white pizza with mozzarella, fontina, parmigiano, pecorino, and Gorgonzola cheese topped with spicy salami. The blend of cheeses offered a strong taste that some may dislike, but I thought the mixture of different cheeses had a unique taste that paired well with the spicy salami! The polpette hot sandwich was delicious as well. The bread was crispy on the outside and the meatball was flavorful with delicious tomato sauce and gooey cheese spilling out of the sandwich with every bite. We unfortunately didn't have room for dessert, but I will have to come back because those Nutella crepes are calling my name!",

The waiting area outside it is nice but not a lot to keep you entertained. The bar is small, with maybe five or six tools there so it's tough to wait there either without feeling extremely crowded. There after, we were underwhelmed by the service. Took a while for the waiter to come around and get our orders. Same thing to get our check at the end. They didn't exactly come around to see if we needed anything additional after our food arrived.   As for the food, the pear salad was delectable! However, the pizza is that they are so well-known for where underwhelming. The dough in the center was soft and chewy the way it supposed to be. But the crust was also a little too soft. It needed to be cooked just an additional minute or two in order to make it crispier. The mozzarella cheese they use on the margarita pizza was also average and certainly not one of the best I've had - definitely not AVPN quality.   Overall a pretty mediocre experience.

    "text": "For the past year and a half, it seems like every article, TV program, and person I know who raves about pizza in Downtown Phoenix that isn't at Bianco has been telling me that I must try Cibo.  \"It's amazing! The food is fantastic! The service is wonderful! They're so friendly there!\" they all cry with passion.  After my experience tonight, the only things I can think of are either (1) I somehow entered a parallel universe around that block and entered a different Cibo, kind of like that episode of \"Star Trek,\" or (2) every one of those sources from my first paragraph is full of beans.  Given that no one working in the restaurant had the necessary Evil Spock-esque goatee, I'm going to assume the latter.  Lest you think I'm being too negative about this place, let me say this: Cibo is definitely a place that serves food.  We (there were three of us) came in at 6:45 on a Friday and were able to get a seat within 5 minutes, even though the patio and inside were both packed - score!  It was a table tucked away in a corner, which we felt would be good for keeping ambient noise to a minimum,  After scoping out some of the food at the other tables, it was determined that a shared appetizer and two pizzas should have been enough for the three of us.  We chose the Schiacciata Maremma, which, besides being impossible for me to pronounce, was described as a roasted vegetable on focaccia-type sandwich, and the margherita (traditional) and funghi (mushroom) pizzas.  The sandwich came first, and we thought that the order may have been put in wrong.  While it was definitely two pieces of bread (that looked and tasted nothing like any focaccia that I've ever had, and not in the good way) with stuff in the middle, it seemed to be missing half of the ingredients.  Billed as being filled with \"mozzarella, roasted bell peppers, eggplant and zucchini,\" we discovered that there was neither eggplant or zucchini anywhere to be found.  Additionally, the whole sandwich was cold, depriving us of gooey, melted mozzarella-y goodness.  We would have complained to our waitress, but she had disappeared, deciding early on to abandon our table after taking our order, serving every other table in the section except for ours.  When the pizzas came (brought by a different waitress), things looked up.  THIS is what Cibo is known for, right?  Quality pizza with fresh ingredients!  Tasty, simple pizza.  Maybe it was a bit TOO simple.  The margherita pizza was a disaster.  The sauce was thin and runny, tasting like the tomato water left over from the can after the tomatoes were used to make the actual pizza sauce, with a lot of salt added in to attempt to cover for the lack of actual spices and seasoning.  The basil was haphazardly thrown on top, most of it still attached to one sprig.  I suppose that if Cibo was billed as an interactive cooking and eating experience, I might have appreciated that a bit more.  After the first slice was eaten, I figured that maybe I had grabbed a bad one (which can happen sometimes with pizzas), so I tried a different slice from the other side of the pie.  It was cold already, and quite soggy.  Since Cibo makes their pizzas with those \"brick oven blisters\" on 'em, this means that the remaining slices all had that watery charcoal flavor that tastes like the cooled-down grill you licked on a dare while drunk last Memorial Day.  The funghi pizza was passable.  The mushrooms did a good job of hiding a lot of the issues (mainly the sauce) that the margherita pizza had.  It too, however, decided that it should freeze up like the surface of Hoth (sans tauntaun innards) after the first slices were taken.  Fifteen minutes after we'd decided that we were done eating soggy pizza, our server decided to stop by our table again.  After all, the folks who were seated ten minutes after we were had completed their dessert, so she realized that she should probably see how our meal was going.  Drinks that had sat un-refilled since our appetizer was served were topped off without warning, and she walked away again, our napkin-covered plates still waiting to be picked up.  \"Do you want any dessert...\" she muttered in an almost muted tone after a different waitress cleared our table.  We said no and asked for the check.  Seven minutes later, she remembered to bring over the check.  We paid in cash and got the heck out of Dodge, wondering how so many people could have led us wrong, how the place stayed so busy, and if maybe, our taste buds had betrayed us.  After all, the denizens of the Arizona Republic, Yelp, and even \"Check Please! Arizona\" had vouched for this place, to say nothing of our friends and work acquaintances.  We decided that there's a massive conspiracy going on, and Cibo has either paid you all off, or laces their food with hypnotic suggestion drugs to which we are somehow impervious.  The food is bad. The service is awful. Stay away.",

    "text": "The Keg at San Tan Village, Gilbert, AZ - Thursday Sept 5th, 2013, about 7:00pm. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  I have been a huge fan of this Keg for many years, so that's what inspired me to write this review. In our party of five I ordered the Classic Filet, medium. When it arrived the first few bites were OK, but on the 3rd or 4th bite I bit into some grizzle. I thought that was odd, being that this was a filet mignon, but I decided to ignore it and kept eating. The last 1/8 of the steak however, turned out to be one big piece of grizzle. That's when I stopped eating and mentioned it to the waiter who in turn called over the manager (he did not offer his name, I did not ask). That's where the biggest disappointment came. I explained the problem to him, and tried to show him how tough the last piece was. He seemed uninterested in examining the offending piece of meat. As if reading from a prepared script for disgruntled diners, he admitted that once in a while a little \"silver skin\" may escape the notice of the chef (this remaining piece was easily 1/2\" thick). And then he proceeded to lecture me TWICE about how I should have let them know early on so they could have corrected the problem, completely ignoring the fact that the problem piece was at the end of the meal. It felt as if he was implying that I was trying to scam a free meal.  To their credit, they took the meal off the bill, which was the right thing to do, and no else in our party had a bad meal. But grizzle in a filet? Really? I have never encountered grizzle in filet mignon. There are plenty of other steak places in our area to try out - DC Steakhouse comes to mind - but The Keg has slipped a notch, a BIG notch, in my book. It's a real shame.",

    "text": "Pizza in my mouth hole! Okay I should probably start off with a classier intro, but let's get real and put some Cibo pizza in there all ready.   Cibo was lucky enough to set the stage for Andrea K's birthday on Saturday night and I was lucky enough to attend for the first time. The restaurant is a converted house in central phoenix that looks very cozy and warm. I say 'looks' because I had to eat outside in the freezing cold dressed inappropriately. Come on Phoenix, I didn't move here for culture, I moved here for a promise of HEAT!   Um, anyway, our group was too large to fit in any of the rooms inside, so we were seated in the front yard with space heaters sporadically placed around us. Our server was very friendly, and though he seemed to be serving the ENTIRE clientele of the restaurant, made his way over to us frequently.  The ladies who delivered the meals weren't terribly effusive, whispering what the order was and trying to set it down in front of whoever was closest, instead of the right person, so I ended up shouting out everything and directing the traffic.  But at the end of the night Cibo was VERY cool about the various methods of payments we utilized for the bill and with such a large group that is generous.  I ordered the Smoked Salmon pizza with arugula and capers added. It was great, I ate almost the entire pizza myself. I did manage to take some home, and what I noticed the next day was that it was uber salty. I love salty food but this was way more than I remembered from the night before and off-putting.  I liked Cibo and I would go back there (in warmer weather) because I think the 'designer' pizzas are fairly reasonable in price and the ambiance is nice.",

The crust...so thin and soft! The cheese...so meltyl! The proscuitto....so salty and perfect!! 6 of us split 2 pesto salads (delicious), and 3 pizzas: the Rustica, Salsiccia and Margherita. The Rustica was my favorite, followed by the Margherita then Salsiccia. The cheese was just so....authentic. The service was delightful. When we arrived, I told them we had 6 people, and I am obviously very pregnant, so the owner was incredibly polite in making sure I was comfortable with where we were sitting and I was cool enough and everything. My only disappointment was that I didn't get any acknowledgement that it was my birthday, but oh well. That's the worst of it. Overall, it was delightful...and I'm looking forward to having a leftover slice of pie right now!!",

We eat at all the local joints in Phoenix and eat all the amazing food we can find. The only issue . . . we always . . always . . get the worst customer experience.   So my wife is 40 weeks pregnant and her birthday was Monday. She wanted - homemade pasta. So we went to Cibo. Everything started off well, greeted right away, service was up to speed - it was looking good. We ordered the house salad, Diavolo pizza and a homemade pasta.   We got the salad first - it was perfect.  Then came the pizza - it was even more perfect than the salad. That's when it happened . . . AGAIN. The waitress came back and asked us if we were ready for dessert - she FORGOT our pasta.   Normally, I would have said something. But this literally was the 5th consecutive time we have gone out to eat at a local joint in Phoenix where they completely forgot us, or something we ordered.   We tipped the waitress well, even though she forgot to place the right order and left. Unfortunately for Cibo - I will once again be looking for the local Phoenix restaurant that is consistent, not only with their food, but with their service. I should NEVER have to ask for my food twice .  . . hopefully they will learn.",

    "text": "As I'm preparing to write this review, I'm experiencing flash backs of how delicious the food was, and I'm salivating as we speak....  I recently visited Cibo while visiting my parents in Arizona. It was a recommendation by a colleague, and I had to share the experience with my lovely parents. Although there was a wait for sitting inside, we didn't mind, because we enjoyed a nice chilled glass of their House Chardonay. Although they said it would be a 20 minute wait, we were seated after 10 minutes. I loved the atmosphere, vibe and feel of Cibo. It's so cozy, and welcoming.   On to the juicy stuff....the FOOD! We started with the Caprese Salad and Pesto Salad. They were both so amazingly delectable. The Caprese salad served it's purpose more than I imagined. The ginormous slices of fresh mozzarella were drizzled with a light olive oil, and accompanied by tomato slices and basil. It was served with some thinly sliced toast that the perfect compliment. On to the Pesto Salad! The Pesto dressing was phenomenal, and to be honst, I don't think I've had a pesto quite like this. It wasn't too thick, but complimented the bed of mixed greens, grape tomatoes, shaved parmigiano, pine nuts and roasted potatoes, perfectly!  For our entree's we ordered the Fughi Pizza, but added Spicy salame and Balsamic onions. I just went into dreamland thinking about how the pizza tasted when I took my first bite! Again, they had mounds of fresh mozzarella, mushrooms and a great tomato sauce. The addition of the balsamic onions and spicy salame took this pizza to a whole new level.  I love how thin the crust of the pizza was, which allowed you to enjoy the True beauty of their pizzas; the fresh cheese and sauce.   I'm going to start a new paragraph just to describe how AMAZING the dessert was that we ordered. Since it was a belated Birthday dinner for my mother, we ordered a Crepe for dessert. It was filled with Mascarpone cheese, and my most favorite thing on earth, NUTELLA!! After all, life is much better with a spoonful of Nutella! It was dusted with powdered sugar, as well as melted chocolate sauce. We decided to forget all of our inhibitions, and added a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream. The warm crepe, accompanied by the ice cream, was delectably sinful!   Before I give myself a heart attack describing the food any longer, I'm going to stop myself. Cibo is definitely a win/win situation. Two thumbs up all around! I can't wait to go back!!",

[This could very easily be a pizza joint found in any neighborhood in San Francisco.]  Picture this: soft, low lighting, faint, hip music playing overhead, ecclectic flair for decorations, friendly staff, amazing aromas wafting from the kitchen -- my heart was all a flutter from the moment I walked in.  I came here based off of a recommendation of one of my best friends and absolutely loved the Quattro Formaggi pizza; the gorgonzola cheese gave the pie a full-bodied flavor.  Trust me, it's a must for all you cheese-lovers out there like me.  ;-)  I would most definitely come back here on my next trip to Phoenix!",

The patio is incredibly cool, and a great place for a date, inside is no less cool and is awesome in decor. All the old bedrooms making the dining rooms is awesome. Antipasta is great, and pizza has always been great. I do take out here a lot and never mind eating inside either.   Last night though, was my first visit in months, and it is just not the same. The pizza was overly doughy, and lacked that crisp wood fired taste and texture. The sauce wasn't the same, as it tasted very bitter in comparison to prior visits. I ordered the Salsicca and what used to seem like a high quality pizza, no longer did. The sausage was some sort of ground meat like substance, compared to what I remember being a high quality sliced sausage. Their wine list has changed since my last visit, and now only has one Cabernet... a rather shitty one at that. My friend had a white pizza that she enjoyed, though my observations about it were mostly the same as though it had gone downhill.   I can't tear into the place though, as the atmosphere is too perfect. Service is spectacular as well, and though I'm bitching about the pizza, it's still great pizza. It's just not what I remember... maybe I've been eating Metro and Bianco too much lately.",

I was excited to try the Nutella and marscapone crepe....what an utter disappointment! There was barely a full teaspoon of Nutella and I couldn't even find the marscapone.

My friend told me that it was the next best thing to pizzeria bianco, so after hearing all the raves about that place (but I still unfortunely havn't been myself) I was certain the Cibo would be really good.  Everything in there is nice and cute, the kitchen, design, even the bread they serve before the meal. But my firends and I spit their house salad which sounded really good to me, but the greens were really stemy.  Then we got a pizza and I loved the crispy crust, but it wasn't anything to die for. But then again my friend took it upon herself to add garlic to it, which I think might have ruined it, so I defintiey want to give this place another try and eat a pizza how it comes.",

The place is very a charming, a converted house with brick wall, chandeliers, and cool art.   They serve sandwiches and salads at lunch time. I got the pastrami and mostly enjoyed it. It was actually a little too rich with the fontina for my liking, but overall pretty good. The bread was toasty and incredible.   The staff was great- nice, genuine and friendly. I love when servers know how to strike the balance of being attentive while giving you time to talk with your company.  Last, but best, we ordered dessert crepes. This is where the 5th star comes in- oh my freaking god. We got a suzette which has orange marmalde folded in and is topped with gran marnier which they light at the table. We also got one stuffed with warm nutella and topped with powedered sugar. It was absolute freaking ecstasy on a plate. Let me tell you- if you ever have a hot date, or an apology to make, do it over wine and dessert crepes at Cibo.",

The patio was packed for lunch so I opted to sit inside and catch up on some news while sipping on a Palagrino, the server recommended the hot Italian sausage sandwich with the house salad, being that I had never been to Cibo, I followed it and was soon in love with the aroma, tangy spices and uniqueness which danced on my palate.

I ended up going here because I was planning on going to Pizzeria Bianco, but the wait was waaaaay too long. The wait here seemed long also, but I got lucky and got a seat at the bar to eat dinner pretty quickly.   I definitely enjoyed the pizza. It's a tasty thin crust and the sausage topping had a lot of flavor. However, I did not like the calzone very much. The inside did not seem cooked like it should be. I was in the mood for ricotta cheese and was regrettably let down. In hindsight I should have tried two different types of pizza, maybe next time, if there is one.",

Took her and a couple of clients here today and the place was awesome!  Cool people, very laid back atmosphere, kick ass food and at a totally fair price. I could stop there but I will go on....  The guy who met us at the door- cool. Our waitress- cool. The nice lady who filled up my tea like 7 times without giving me the \"seriously dude\" look- yup, cool.   On the location- We met at 11:30- way early by downtown lunch standards so I was kinda freaked out from the look of things out front, not much happening. Once we got inside, it made me feel like I had stumbled into the kind of place I wanna be in. Nice and clean, but totally got that old converted house feeling (in a good way). Oh, and by 12:30 when we left- packed!  The food- Yum! At our table there were two PLT's (one of them mine), basically prosciutto, lettuce & tomato, a pastrami sandwich and another sammy that I cannot recall. What I can recall is that everyone liked them- me especially. It was great... perfectly toasted bread, great fillings and a nice little salad. And for desert since my lady companions insisted- a crepe suzette and a crepe with nutella. And of course- damn!  The price- Bout $60 for all 4 of us. I would have spent that easily at some place that I would not have been half as happy with.   Final thought- go, eat, drink tea and enjoy!",

WE LOVE CIBO!!!!!  Everytime we go in everyone is amazing.  This last time in particular was just amazing, we got Matt as our server-he's amazing, he takes such great care of his guests and I was so excited to get to have him again, he's like a celebrity and doesn't eve know it.  Now that the weather is cooling off we sat outside, drank some wine, enjoyed lots of yummy food.  I love the funghi with salami and one of my friends got the calzone... bombdotcom :) of course we got dessert and again mind blowing!  See you all next month for some amazing food, service and atmosphere.  xxoo",

The food is just as good (similar, rather limited menu, so make sure everyone in your party is up for pizza & salads & wine), but the wait to get seated is MUCH shorter and the patio setting is LOVELY. Even the indoor seats are preferable to Bianca's open room brick box.  My husband and I get so excited for the cooler weather in Phoenix because we know that Cibo's patio is now an option for Date Night. Try the calzone and one of their great salads (i'm partial to the Omero but the Pear Salad is wonderful as well). A glass or two of the house Chianti makes it complete.  Oh, if you have room, the Crepes are delicious--share them with someone you love for dessert. Service has always been attentive, but not overly friendly (it's not that kind of place).",

Cibo is located in a residential area so parking is limited around the neighborhood. As walked up to the restaurant I became very impressed with outside seating setup. Very intimate with a romantic feel.   When I walked in to be seated I was greeted right away. This is always a plus for me. The setup inside is nice. There are dinning areas in each room of the house with awesome art work hanging from the walls.  Now for the main attraction! The PIZZA WAS THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD!!. He waitress was very kind and helpful. She made great recommendations and I was also impressed with the cheese ball appetizers. I really love cheese... Lol. The pizza was cooked to perfection. I had one side that was a kind of cheese pepperoni and the other covered in bruschetta. Awesome choice I really recommend.   I will defiantly be back to donate more money!",

    "text": "Been to Cibo a couple times, but not for several years. Took the hubster for his first time last night and was slightly worried it may not live up to how much I had hyped it up. Sometimes restaurants, over the years, stop paying attention to detail and loose their oomph. Omg. Not Cibo. Everything was so delicious. We had the pesto salad to start. A little bland for my taste, but very fresh tasting and the fried potatoes, while a little weird sounding in a salad, added a yum savoriness. Hubby loved it. We then ordered the Diavola pizza and the Tartufata. We are both big time red sauce believers. Very rarely will we order a pizza that doesn't have red sauce. The Diavola had a fresh delicious crushed tomato sauce that was just perfect. The spicy salami was perfect, not greasy or too fatty tasting (which I still love but maybe more on a charcuterie). The Tartufata was the white pizza. Mushrooms, procuitto, mozzarella... and... truffle oil. TRUFFLE.OIL. Omg. So good. Both pizzas' crust was perfect. To end the super healthy feast, we decided we would go out with a bang and get the mascarpone and Nutella crepe with ice cream (because obv). Life changing. The mascarpone smooths out the Nutella perfectly. Not too sweet, but still rich. Anyway, I want another crepe for breakfast and if Cibo was closer right now, I would order two. No shame in my game.",

I loved the chick pea dressing.  I have experimented with making my own version, but have come no where close to this.  Genova Pizza- Potatoes on pizza is a great thing.   La Noce Pizza- Not as wonderful as the Genova, but still a solid pizza.   Both pizzas had a crunchy chewy crust, fresh sauce and herbs, and creamy cheese.

However, the best part of Cibo is definitely not the decor or ambiance. it is that food. Their appetizers are a so very delicious way to begin your culinary experience here. Then when it is time to pick your main course, just start with the top and move down the list. I can guarantee that once you've eaten here you'll keep coming back for more. I know I do.  Their wines are not too pricey either which is great... especially if you can take advantage of their happy hour. it is a valued place for sure. thank you for making every experience a good one... that's why I keep on coming home to you!",

You walk up to the beautifully lit and cozily warmed outdoor seating space and either wait or get your table. We had a 5 minute wait. Not bad for a Friday night. We shared a bottle of the wine on special and ordered the Il Tagliere to share. This app is highly recommended. It was my favorite part of the meal. A wooden charcuterie board was placed in front of us filled with cured meats, olives, cheese, artichokes, walnuts, and apple. Perfect!   I also ordered the Siena pizza. I was generally satisfied with the flavor of the crust, cheese, and toppings, however, they added the large slices of spek and zucchini after cutting the pizza which made it difficult to maneuver. Cibo is a winner. I'd be back.",

    "text": "Cibo is one of my favorite restaurants here in the valley.  It has everything that I'm looking for.  Excellent food (pizza), good prices, great vibe and scene.  I have been here several times, but we last visited Cibo the other day so it refreshed my memory.  Plus, I realized that I never reviewed it before!  Anyways, we came on a Tuesday afternoon during happy hour.  It was such a nice spring Phoenix afternoon that we sat outside in their patio.  Actually, this is all we have ever sat at on our prior visits.  It's because I absolutely love their patio.  It really feels like I'm eating in a outdoor garden.  Such a cool and great feel, one of the main reasons why we keep coming back.  The inside is also very nice, Cibo is a converted home into a restaurant, but we just prefer to sit on the patio.  For the happy hour menu they have several appetizers from $4-$6 dollars, plus $4 house wines and $2.5 Peronis.  We ordered the Polpette (meatballs with bread).  It was great, Cibo's sauce was amazing and a great compliment to the meatballs.    We also ordered from the pizza menu, the Diavola with added ricotta cheese.  It was a tomato based sauce pizza with spicy salame.  Our server recommend that  we add ricotta cheese.  I'm glad that we did, this was a great pizza.  it was perfectly cooked.  Crust was flakey, yet soft.  The ricotta added a nice creamy texture.  We really enjoyed our pizza, and with the appetizer it was a good amount of food for my wife and i to split.  We ended up passing on dessert, but have had their crepes before and they were excellent.  I really can't say much more about Cibo.  Again it is one of our go to places to eat while we are in downtown Phoenix.  This is a perfect place to enjoy a nice romantic meal at decent prices.  Can't really beat the value here, nor the food.   We look forward to coming back sometime soon!",

Cibo serves Italian style pizza in a cozy classic downtown house with a darling yard. If avoid the busy night (Friday and Saturday) it is usually fairly easy to get a nice table outside.  They have a good list of salads, I usually go for the pear salad but their burrata is also quite tasty. Their pizza use simple ingredients and are delicious - stay classic with a margarita or add a little fun they are all delectable. Can't speak for their other dishes as I go there for pizza... And desert, the \"fresca\" which is ice cream, crepe, whipped cream and berries is just a nice way to end your meal and probably your diet.  The wine selection is intriguing I usually go for a glass of red from Friuli because... It's good and quite unusual to find.  A classic to go back to!",

I love the spicy salami pizza and their homemade lemon cello is very delicious. Their pizzas are reasonably priced, and you get a pizza that can feed 1 to 2 people for about $14. They cook their pizzas in a wood fire oven, and even cook their sandwich bread in the oven. I would definitely recommend for lunch or dinner.",

I am not a fan of the calamari strips (versus the tubular presentation with the tentacles included).    My husband had a delicious tasting salad with chicken and walnuts.  We shared a giant fresh fruit and ice cream crepe.  It was very light and extremely good.  We will go back again to sample additional things on the menu.  I bet it is beautiful at night!",

    "text": "Finally, I got to try the pizza that everyone has been raving about!    Being a pizza snob, I take my pizza seriously!  I had been to Cibo long ago but was discouraged by the fact that this place, which labels itself as a \"pizzeria\" did not serve any pizza during lunch.  A fact that was never mentioned over the years by all the rave reviews, in advertisements, or even on their own website.  I'm sure many others experienced the disappointment of finding this out on their first visit.    The news that they had recently started to serve pizza options for lunch prompted me to finally return.  Though I should note that (at this point) your pizza choices are limited to only four selections, nothing like the nearly two dozen options available at dinner.  Cibo's pizza harkens back to the traditional pizza from Napoli, however it falls short of accomplishing this feat, and for those who have experienced \"authentic\" pizza, this comes across as a failed attempt.  However, it is definitely a step up from average pizza place.  I ordered the Salsiccia Pizza, which has tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and sausage. The crust is made from \"00\" flour, cooked in a fired oven and is soft and appealing, however it fails at the trademark chewiness, and is lacking any type of character development.  In other words...bland.  I was very happy with the fresh mozzarella and more so with the real fennel sausage, however the tomatoes lacked any brightness, and were lost under the other, more aggressive flavors.  My pizza was barely seven inches, and was cut in eight pieces, which made the slices too narrow to handle the toppings, so attempting to eat this by hand resulted in more toppings returning to the plate, than were entering my mouth.  Cibo resides in a rehabilitated home on 5th Avenue, which is small, but inviting.  They have a small lot, and on street parking is shared with other businesses and residences, so parking can be an issue.  Overall the pizza is decent, however, why would I bother to return here when I can get much better (and larger) pizza at either of the two \"Certified\" authentic pizzerias that are just blocks away?",

The house wines were a bargain at four dollars a glass. Three gigantic meatballs in a delicious tomato sauce along with slabs of grilled fresh bread were an amazing appetizer. So were the arrancini, oozing with fresh mozzarella!  We decided to stick with appetizers, and got the mixed grilled vegetables and the fried calamari. Both were remarkably good (so I was grateful we decided to share!)  The grilled vegetables were a large portion,  artfully arranged and cooked to perfection. Zucchini, yellow summer squash, fresh mushrooms, grilled red peppers, and the most amazing grilled vinegar onions ever!!!  The fried call Amari was strips of calamari steaks tender in a crispy breading that stood up to the spicy sauce it was served with.  We could not resist espresso and Polini for dessert. Those were a little sugar encrusted donut holes that came along with a ramekin of Nutella for dipping.   Cibo was like a visit to little Italy in New York City, without the airfare!!! Service was friendly and personal, and converted house the restaurant occupies is full of local art and views of either the garden or the patio. There is even complimentary valet parking.   We are going to make Cibo a regular stop on our  trips to Phoenix---and we haven't even tried the pizza yet!!",

Obviously they have a fierce pizza oven in there! The pizza and the salad were both excellent! We were so impressed, we ordered dessert. I can't find it on the online menu so I don't remember the name, but it was a warm crepe filled with ricotta and piled with lovely fresh berries. Delish - and not terribly heavy.

They have a text system to alert when your table is ready, so that was nice. We ended up walking around the neighborhood to kill time.   I would have preferred to eat out on the patio, but I didn't want to wait any longer. The patio looked very nice lit up. They also had live music which would have been a plus if we ate outside.

Throughout our lunch the waiter became less attentive. My husband ordered a second beer that he waited for, about 10 minutes. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen so my husband kindly ordered from the bartender and noticed our waiter sitting at a table on his phone. My husband came back to sit down and then our waiter came right away with the beer and our pizza. We tried the Capri salad which was sadly, very bland. The pesto dressing definitely needed a bit of salt to balance the flavors. Our family shared a Margherita, Diavola, Prosciutto Crudo and the Di Notte pizzas, they were all very tasty. The crust was chewy and had a great flavor. Overall the food was good but I would not say the best. We live in north Phoenix so if they were closer to us we would go back but we wouldn't make the drive to come here again.",

The ultimate creamy delight. We had the \"Quattro Formaggi\" and it was wonderful as well, it had, \"Mozzarella, Fontina, Parmigiano, Pecorino and Gorgonzola.\" We also had the \"Genova\" which had, \"Mozzarella, basil pesto, onions, roasted potatoes and grated Parmigiano\", plus I added Bresaola (cured beef) to it, loved this one too!   They have a lovely wrap around patio with large trees and lights creating a cozy and enjoyable atmosphere. Inside, there's different areas to sit as well. For parking they have their own small lot for valet or you can park along 4th Avenue for free, no parking meters there, and it's a short walk to Cibo.  The service was also excellent. Although it was busy, staff was still friendly, was always helpful, and smiled!  This is definitely a beautiful spot for a date, with friends, or family!",

Parking is street parking only though.   When ordering ... get a pizza. I feel like you can't go wrong. We got the truffle pizza and it was absolutely delicious. I think one of or THE BEST pizza I've ever had. The thin crust was crunchy and not soggy. Toppings were fresh. We opted for half and half of a pizza. This is allowed but be advised they do charge you the price of the more expensive pizza.   Trust me, this is a must eat place in Phoenix and this is coming from me ... someone who does not like Italian food.   The other dish we got was a pasta. It was ok. Not as memorable as the pizza so ... get the pizza now!",

This has got to be my favorite dining experience during our one week stay. One of the few to truly deserve the 5-stars during my perusal of the yelp app for breakfast, lunch, and dinner spots.  I got their Pappardelle Bolognese & the waiter served me some wine to go with it and it was fineeeee. As a Houstonian, this food is good.   That's it. That's all I really got to say.

To start off, we ordered the cheesy rice balls as well as the burratta-- both were excellent.  The burratta comes on a bed of cherry tomatoes, with about 5 pieces of toasted bread.  At first it seems like little but there is plenty to go around.  Same goes with the rice balls-- 5 are in an order, which is plenty.  We ordered the margarita pizza as a shared entree as well as the fungi.  The margarita included fresh roasted garlic, which added so much flavor to this classic pizza.  Highly recommend!",

We really wanted to sit outside because it's so cute with all the lights and music playing but after waiting 40 minutes, we decided to just dine inside and got seated right away.  There were literally so many open tables inside and I totally get why because if you could just see how the restaurant looks outside, you would want to dine outside as well.  Perfect spot for a nice dinner date!  We shared: -Il Tagliere (5/5)  Basically a charcuterie board and wow, it comes with so much food! Not only do you get a selection of cheese and italian meats, but it also comes with a variety of nuts, fruits and roasted veggies as well.  I would definitely recommend this board to share.   -Tartufata Pizza (5/5) I saw that a lot of people ordered this white pizza so why not.  It comes with mozzarella, prosciutto, white mushrooms and is drizzled with white truffle oil after its been cooked.  Literally so freaking good.  The truffle oil just really tops it off.    If you're in the area and looking for a really good Italian spot, this is the one!",

The ambiance of this place particularly the outdoor seating area is absolutely gorgeous! The inside seating area appeared very homely and cozy. The wait was approximately 35 minutes for an outdoor table. Our server was very helpful.   We ordered the Arancini and the bruschetta as starters. The Arancini was nice and crispy with a flavorful marinara sauce on the side. The bruschetta was my favorite! It came with so many delicious grape tomatoes. Would highly recommend getting the bruschetta.  Between 4 people, we ordered the funghi and marinara pizzas which were just enough for us with the appetizers. The funghi was amazing! The marinara was flavorful with its fresh garlic and oregano.   Overall, loved this place! Is a great date night spot as well. Will definitely come back when in town again!",

After seeing the awesome performance of Shen Yun, I was 8n the mood for some fine Italian food. So, I got on Yelp, and found this place to be less than a mile away (in the index, the hours are not shown).  So, I headed over, and as I drove by, there were several cars in the small parking lot, and the gates were open.  So, I parked down the block, walked back through the parking lot, and the courtyard.   When, I walked around to the front, and tried to pull the door open, it was locked. :-(   Only then, did I see the sign that they didn't open until 5. And, since it was 3:52, I was too hungry to wait around for over an hour.  So, why so many cars in the parking lot? And, why was the courtyard open?  Maybe I'll come back here for my birthday dinner, and I can update my review to include the food and service.",

    "text": "Not going to lie, I was a little disappointed with my Cibo experience. I had super high expectations though so that might have been part of the issue. It is really cute in here! I love the aesthetic. I liked the grape vines outside! It's very cute here. So I have always wanted to try arancini so we got that to start. I am a vegetarian so I thought it was helpful that they mark everything that is vegetarian. Or so I thought..saw that the arancini was vegetarian and it was supposed to be a fried rice ball with cheese. The server brings it out and says ok here's your arancini! We also added beef and peas! I am grateful she said something..but ew. I wanted a rice ball with cheese like the menu said. Not beef and peas. She didn't ask us if that was ok. So I asked her if we could just have cheese ones and she said yes but they all are going to have peas. The peas are not like ground up and mixed in so I didn't really understand that. I was thankful she got us new ones though, that was nice. They didn't taste good though, they were way too fried and the peas felt out of place. For my meal I ordered a sandwich that had mint, arugula, tomatoes, and cheese on it with a side salad. I liked the salad! The sandwich was alright, the mint taste was a little too much for me. I loved the bread though! My boyfriend got a margherita pizza without basil. The crust and cheese were delicious! I thought the sauce was gross though. Both on the pizza and on the side to dip the arancini in. It tastes like it's straight from the can, that metallic-y taste. I personally did not like it. Our service was not too bad. Not the best ever, but not bad. I would give this place a second try but I think I'd need to order something different off the menu, not involving tomato sauce.",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place so badly, but I can't give them more than 3 stars unfortunately. My wife and I are new to the area and wanted to find some good neopolitan pizza. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table for 2 which is completely reasonable considering we were there at 6:30pm on a Saturday.  I will say this much: Their pizza is delicious and the prices are fair. The atmosphere outside is really nice in the evening. They had some live music and the lighting is very romantic. It's a nice date night.  We were put in a very very small room up against the wall. It felt extremely cramped. We ordered the Arancini for an appetizer. The portion size was great, the deep fried balls were huge. However they were far too crunchy to the point where they hurt our teeth biting into them. They lacked any real flavor and there wasn't enough cheese inside. The marinara sauce that came with it was really good though.  The service was god awful. The appetizers took a little while to come out as did my salad. The waitress was fine and continued to let us know that the pizza would be out soon. \"Soon\" turned into and hour and a half though. I get it, they are busy, but a table of 4 was seated down next to us about 30 minutes after us and they had their pizzas before us. I'm not sure if she forgot to put in the order or if the kitchen lost it, but it was entirely too long of a wait.  After the pizza my wife wanted to order a crepe for dessert. It was 45 minutes between placing the order and receiving the dessert. There's absolutely no excuse for this. It takes about 60 seconds to make a crepe. The waitress continued to service other tables near us as we waited but never once stopped at ours to give us an update or an explanation as to why it was taking so long. After it came out she stopped at the table and said \"oh it finally came out? how is it?\" It was to the point where we were considering canceling the order and asking for the bill before the dessert came out.  Even getting the check and paying the check took forever. We watched other tables come and go without issue, so I'm not really sure why everything took so long for us.   I'd love to eat their pizza again, but I don't think any pizza is worth that type of wait.",

I took a picture of all the items we ate. We visited Phoenix Arizona  for the first time and found this place on yelp. We loved the ambience outside.  And enjoyed eating inside too. We went two time during our trip.   Eating inside was very loud but outside was very lovely. It seemed to be busy all the time, we stayed at a near by hotel and did drive-by's. Two times, it looked too busy and we did a take-out one time, too.  It was sooooooo good!!   They had a Secret dessert menu.  We had two desserts from that list. Both were delicious!   It's busy for good reason. If you are in the area, get you some good food from there.   Aloha from Hawaii! See you on our next visit to Phoenix.",

We sat down and my friend had a few slices of their margarita pizza and of course I got to share.  All I can say is that this is definitely and totally a five star pizza experience. The crust was perfect the cheese was amazing and the sauce was absolutely the best around. So if you're in the area definitely stop by because you won't be disappointed.",

For an enhanced enchanted night out, sitting outside helps set that romantic, candle lit dinner. Price is reasonable per person. I went with a couple of friends before the Ariana Grande concert at Talking Stick and had the tomato, Mozzarella, basil, and pesto sandwich. It was warm and fresh with each crunchy bite. Please! Do not get me started on the Truffle fries! Crunchy, thick, delicious French fries.   What I love most is that it's a whole in a wall. You have to really look around to realize there is a restaurant. This place is pretty busy on First Friday's, but you will never regret waiting to eat here!",

Cute little historic home converted into a restaurant, tons of charm little space as is the norm in downtown suburbia. Main entrance..11 o'clock 3 two tops..bam right there not 5 ft from the door. 12 o'clock kitchen, 1 o'clock bar, 3 o'clock  two 2 tops lining the wall. We were offered one of the 11'oclock tables but there was no way. There is nothing I hate more than sitting on top of another table. They were so close even Nicole Ritchie couldnt squeeze between them. This space would be better served by 3 small high bar tables, allow for more traffic space and you're not forced to dine with strangers. Needless to say I would rather wait for a table that avoids the potential of being bumped and or drinks/food being spilled on me. We were seated in a side room and it was perfect, not too close to fellow diners yet still feeling a part of the energy. From the seating to departure was excellent. Service, was impeccable. Pizza's take a bit but they're made from scratch and worth waiting for. I ordered a white pizza (Salsiccia con Patate) and it was perfection.. My friend ordered a red pizza which I tried and you can taste the fresh tomatoes, no canned sauce here. Although extremely tasty Im still loyal to Spinatos on the red pizza. But white pizza they have my vote. Made sure I didnt gorge because I was dying to try their dessert. I am a HUGE fan of Nutella and they have 3 or 4 variations on Nutella crepes..I had the banana/nutella concoction with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and Im salivating being reminded of it. Nice call on the dessert Cibo, if not the white pizza I will return for the dessert. Either way I will be back.  P.S. We let at 8pm and there had to be at least an hour wait. If you have somehwere to be on Saturday night and this is your first stop. I suggest you get there upon opening at 5pm to avoid any interruption in your plans.",

    "text": "Cibo... surprisingly earning 5 stars from me.  This is overall a great place to EAT!  The setting:    It is on the corner of the street on 5th ave near downtown Phoenix.  It is in a house, that's right, someone's house turned into a charming little restaurant where the front yard has tons of little tables weaved around trees and patio heaters in the winter.  They also have a beautiful set up with the lights hung from the trees that gives you that intimate feel as soon as the sun hides out for the night.  On weekends you'll get some live music, calm accoustic music from nothing but reguar joe's outside on a picnic table entertaining the old fashion way, with guitars and other instruments to soothe you into the delicious food that awaits.  Inside, as soon as you walk in you notice the Chef, through a small opening, a glimpse into where the magic happens.  He is there on weekends for sure.  And yes you want to eat there while he is present.   The food:  It was a busy friday night for us and it was FAST.  Not too fast, we did not feel rushed out of there.  The pizza's had that wood fire smell I grew up with, it reminded me of the pies this Italian man used to serve out of his van (which had a wood fire oven in it), when I was a child.  The best pizza in the world, somehow Cibo duplicated that taste and brought back some childhood memories just like Remy's ratatouille did for Igor.   Don't miss the Buratta appertizer, big enough to share with 3 or 4 people at $14.  The cheese was simply bliss, if you love good fresh mozzarella you've had nothing yet, this buffalo moz is outstanding... creamy and perfectly balanced with grilled bread and prosciutto.  You will not be sorry.  The Burschetta Trio is also a very nice size portion, it does come in six pieces for only $10.  That's a bargain.  If you have the buratta and then taste the mozzerella on the bruschetta you will find it bland and the mozerella will taste like a cheaper cheese  so eat the bruschetta first.    now to the \"Pizze\"...   Just triumphant.  Don't look any further this has what you need, just keep your order simple and you will not dissapointed.  The Service:   Folks there sound Italian, from the greetings to pronouncing things the correct way to us butcher the beautiful language.  Everything sounds and taste better when you know how it is meant to be pronouced.  They were friendly and efficient.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Italians know that if you want to sit there for a while while you eat... go for it.  Don't miss:  The burarta app and of course the pizzas.  Sit outside and enjoy the neighborhood feeling of dining in your front lawn.  REMEMBER:  If you want to try some of the best Mozzerella you've ever tasted, call in advance to see if they have Burrata in that week... They can run out of this little piece of heaven...  Cibo, you are a strong restaurant, a gem.  Keep up the good food and the tradition that flows in your menu.",

For a $17 pizza, we expected it to be loaded with meat. It was just the opposite and tasted mediocre. Fresh & Easy pizza tastes better than Cibo. The service was also horrible. The girl who brought us the pizza just plopped the pizza onto the table and walked away. She didn't even ask if we wanted another beer. For good pizza with fresh ingredients, check out Grimaldi's. My next adventure will be Pizzeria Bianco.",

The food was fantastic, the staff friendly and efficient, and the environment (a bungalow-style house) was charming.   We had another engagement so we ate early and were able to be seated immediately.  I'm told the restaurant is very busy at a later time.  We ate indoors, although the patio looked inviting as it was quiet and had misters.   My party shared the bruschetta appetizer (two each of three different kinds, one better than the next), a pizza, and the house salad.  All were delicious.  My niece opted for dessert and chose the Nutella and marscapone crepe with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  (She can do that ... she's still young.)  Mom and I each had a bite and pronounced it heavenly.  I can't speak to the beverages as we just had water (which needed to be filtered).   The meal wasn't inexpensive but most restaurants in that area are pricey (if they even serve dinner, as that is an office neighborhood with many places serving breakfast & lunch only).  I will definitely return as my sole complaint was with the complimentary H2O.  The next time I'll pay for bottled water.",

Maybe it was the fact that there were 15 of us that our server was never around. Maybe it was because it was my birthday they decided to give attitude whenever we requested more drinks.   Pizzas were sub-par from what I had expected, don't throw a couple slices of bell pepper and bits of zucchini and call it a vegetarian pizza. Plain cheese pizza was on the very-salty side. Drinks were not getting refilled and not once was I checked up on after food was served.  Not cool, Cibo!  Not cool at all!",

The atmosphere is just perfect. Our part actually sat outside, which the patio is just beautiful on a AZ October night. I didn't even feel like I was sitting in Phoenix. The restaurant is in a cute historic house and the patio is filled with older trees and plenty of plant life. There was even a cute little white cat running around. I felt like I was sitting in someone's grandma's garden. Someone's grandma who makes kick as freaking food.  For dinner, my party of three of us split the 3 Pair Bruschetta. The waiter made it sound like it was going to be small, but it's not. These are three GOOD sized pieces of bruschetta topped with a ton of toppings. I really enjoyed the Prosciutto one. Melt in your mouth good. Then we split the De Notte pizza. It was a white pizza with spicy salami, mozzarella and tomatoes. The top of the pizza was burnt just enough to give it that perfect flavor. I don't remember the last time, if ever I had a pizza THAT good. I was a little disappointed we didn't get to try a red pizza, but we were plenty full from the appetizer and main entree. Not too full to split a nutella crepe topped with vanilla ice cream..oh yeah baby, can't go wrong with a little nutella in your mouth. That's what she said.  Service was great. Our waiter was quick, despite how busy the place was. He was very friendly and very helpful, except for telling us the brushetta was small not that I'm complaining :). And I think the price was very right. I couldn't believe how inexpensive dinner was for 3 people and all the food plus drinks we had. Very reasonable. I plan on taking the husband there soon!",

I was impressed by the ambience of the restaurant and the overall presentation. But the pizza itself was not great at all. It's definitely no where near the taste of Bianco's and I was hoping this place would be a good alternative.  My friends go here a lot for lunch to get sandwiches. I may give that a try sometime but I would advise against coming here for dinner.  Instead grab dinner somewhere else and come here and grab a nutella & banana crepe for dessert! Now that was good.",

We sat in the back and had a beautiful view of the city and the small garden area surrounding the restaurant.  (There is a small area just to the right of the entrance that has four tables in close proximity with stone floors and, I believe, brick walls.  The sound in that area is overwhelming so I would not sit there.)  I had a white, gluten free pizza, called Procida that was really delicious: mozzarella, prociutto crudo, asian pears, arugula and goat cheese.  My son had gluten free crust with pepperoni and sausage and he loved it and my husband had one of schiacciata sandwiches, maybe romagnaola - it seemed like it had sausage in it but I don't see that on the menu.  Everything was savory, warm, crusty, and really enjoyable to eat.  We had the fresca for desert and it was really like a party on a plate:  artistically folded crepe around ice cream and fruit, covered with multi colored pieces of fruit and whipped cream and also very pleasant to eat.  A really enjoyable dining experience!",

    "text": "I would suggest that anyone who lives here and has not been come, and if you're in town and looking for a great local non-chain restaurant that has quality food prepared the way it should, then try Cibo!    I took my man here for \"mystery date night\" as a surprise since he had never been.  No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes! take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool.  I love the atmosphere of the patio also, lit with those great off-white lights, and fire pits.  We shared the burrata which was gynormus, easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us.  The wine was tasty and reasonable.  I was drinking a pinot grigio, and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version.  It was very good, definitely not from grandmas!   Now for the pizza - it is just perfection.  It has that amazing combination of char on the crust, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings.  It almost melts in your mouth, it's not heavy at all.  It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint!  So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella, ricotta, AND a scoop of ice cream on top.  I don't typically die over dessert, it's my boyfriends thing.  I'm an app girl - but this, it wasn't too sweet, it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness.  I would never eat here without dessert again!    I have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour, but they don't fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why I prefer that here.  You will feel at home at this spot in a group or on a date - hell, maybe even a mystery one :)",

I had a friend visiting from San Francisco and she, along with my husband and I, arrived on a Saturday evening just as the (previously mentioned) wedding party had departed. We were greeted by the super sweet propietor and his wife. We ordered a drink (wine and beer prices were really reasonable) and took in the early 1900's bungalow where the restaurant is housed. There was so much character here (and so few TVs!) I really felt like I was back in Oakland.  We were seated quickly on their lovely patio. It was a gorgeous night and the ambiance was absolutely perfect. Our server admited to being a bit overwhelmed but still managed to give us prompt, humorous, and personable service.  We had brushcetta and a salad for an appetizer. Both were good. For dinner we each ordered a pizza - margarita (excellent), capricciosa (good), and salsiccia con patate (excellent). My SF friend was not as impressed as I was, but I truly enjoyed the food and the overall experience. Will definitely be back. Oh! And we found it on Yelp!",

    "text": "Apparently, I've not written my review of Cibo as yet.  Cibo has excellent pizza in a charming atmosphere - it's a great date restaurant, Girls-Night-Out restaurant, or \"Place to take your hip Mom\" restaurant.  Not a ton of testosterone here.  Which is fine, we're secure enough to come here and sit on the spindly little patio chairs and sip wine and munch on pizza and idly agree with the dining companion du jour about how cute everything is.    I lied in the previous sentence.  I never munch on pizza.  Perhaps I shouldn't be hungry as I write this, but I tend to devour my pizza in such a way that embarrasses anyone with a good view.  I imagine it must be like a train wreck.    The service here has some issues.  They always take care of me, per se, and they do it with a degree of aplomb, but I have gotten some attitude here previously.  Maybe they have elephantine memories and remember that time I brought my plastic cup of iced mocha from Fair Trade and refused to let them take it until halfway through my meal (I wasn't done with it!!!!) or the one time my friend asked if she could get a side of Ranch Dressing (not kidding, seriously you should know by now I honestly couldn't make this stuff up [to which request the waiter replied with a terse \"Umm, no.\"])    I have yet to find the perfect pizza ingredients here - Diavolo is too spicy, other things I've tried are too sweet, not enough flavor, or have other drawbacks (vegetables, for instance) which prevent them from being favorites.  I guess I come back for the overall experience, despite the occasionally uneven service.  Plus, it's almost magically easy compared to Bianco's.  (probably the only comparison with Bianco's it will ever win).",

I guess this place used to be a house and you can tell by the layout and the inside is just as cute as their patio. Highly recommend this as a date spot.  We ordered the pear salad, which was surprisingly good...I don't usually like arugula. Very tasty indeed! I was disappointed by the pear in the salad. If you are going to have a pear salad you should try to ensure that the pear is ripe and that it actually tastes like a pear. We also shared the vegetarian pizza which was also good. Something about the crust or the sauce or the cheese it just had a distinct flavor. It was a bit weird that the pizza was separated by the veggies i.e. one slice of red pepper, one slice of zucchini. I would have preferred for the veggies to be cut into smaller pieces and sprinkled throughout the pizza. Random? The italian beer was refreshing and lite...perfect for a hot summer night. I would definitely come back to try other things on their menu.",

I dont remember the fancy terms used to describe it but basically it was a ham and cheese sandwich on some sort of flat bread. It was pretty good, and for a restaurant with a lot of fancy sounding food the price was really reasonable. Less than $10 per person as I recall.  The only downside was that its very small inside and the sound of people talking crescendos to the point that I could barely hear myself think, let alone hear what my lunch colleagues were saying.   In the end, I left well fed and happy. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for something new and interesting.",

I've never been to a restaurant that has that much LACK of service, its amazing how many people actually come back for more bad service, I guess its because of the food, which I can understand. We had Divola pizza, great fresh cheese, salami and fresh tomatoes. For dessert we ordered a freshly made crepe, w/ marscarpone cheese and nutella.. it was heavenly!

So the waitress seemed easily overwhelmed, gave us the wrong bill, the wrong drinks, took a while getting our food-ok, a REALLY long time, and also dropped my friend's credit card, luckily I saw it laying on the ground. But the sandwiches we ordered were amazing! Went for lunch. So no pizza on the menu at this time. You will have to find parking, which can be a little tough. There is a lot behind the \"restaurant\", which is really a little bungalow type house and gives it the character. I had the Salsiccia sandwich which was fesh hot and amazing! The Italian Sausage was probably the best I've ever tasted and they feature fresh baked bread in a wood burning oven. The greens were also crisp and fresh and they feature creative salads which could be a meal in itself. Overall, the place is unique and delicious and perfect inside for a date, a lunch meeting and I can't wait to go back for dinner. Yum!",

The anitpasto was okay...but, we were seated at a table so dark that we couldn't see the antipasto items. Our  waitress knew her wines and we enjoyed one we chose with her, but she forgot a soda order and we waited nearly half an hour before we saw her again. We didn't receive serving utensils with eirther the appetizer or the pizza. We were told their pzza service was 'casual'. No utensils? I enjoyed the food but I would get it to go next time.",

On one of the first pleasant mornings of the fall, is there a better way to have tasty food than outside with friends.  My omelet with Schreiner's  sausage hit the spot.  A couple of other folks had the Uvoa Arizona - eggs with chorizo and green chili, which were quickly scarfed.  A mimosa topped off the morning while the friends headed to disappointment in Glendale, Gale and I treked home for an afternoon of Sunday newspapers and pleasant company.",

My recommendation: If you only take one thing from this review, you must order the \"Burrata\" appetizer.  It's a creamy ball of mozzarella, drizzled with some balsamic vinegar, served with proscuitto and magnificent toasted bread.    All of the pizzas we've ever ordered have been tremendous, and the dessert crepes with nutella are absolutely to die for.  You'll love this place!",

Just amazingly tasty, simple, pizza with quality ingredients made the right way in a brick oven.  Pizzeria Bianco might have em by an inch just based on pizza alone, but if you don't want to wait 2.5 hours for a pie, Cibo is the place to be, and almost as good.  And although Bianco has a 2.5 hour wait whereupon i generally drink wine for the duration(which might be part of the reason the pie is so good), the limoncello at Cibo generally floors me just as well in a quarter of the time..",

It was tough to find, as it feels like you're just cruising through purely residential areas when all of the sudden one of the old victorian houses has a humbly posted \"Cibo\" sign on the corner.   The decor is fantastic. It feels like you're in an old restaurant in northern California with clever ornamentation. The menu was a little confusing, and apparently there are some limitations on the lunch menu as compared with dinner, but we thought we were ordering pizzas and somehow ended up with sandwiches. This wasn't really a problem though, since these sandwiches were exceptionally tasty and served on pizza bread.   Definitely a great find and a new item on the list of places to take out of town visitors.",

Cibo has a lovely patio (perfect for spring/summer, but even w/ the heat lamps it would have been too cold), a cute tiny bar (not much room for waiting), and great thin crust pizza. I like the light feeling of the pizza, but I think it could be more flavorful. Still, for Phx, this place is pretty great. I recommend trying a couple pizzas and sharing. Also the pear salad is fantastic! I think I enjoyed it even more than the pizzas.",

We went there on a Saturday night and the waited  for an hour for a table while being able to meet the friendly owners. We ended up with a small table on the patio. Our waiter was half attentive to us throughout the night. The thin pizza crust was not as crispy as we would have like it. My husband's pizza was on the salty side. My pizza with spicy salami was good, not the best pizza ever.  After all the great things I've heard about this place, I was a little disappointed with the food. I wish the great atmosphere was matched with great food. I'd say it's a really nice place to hang out with friends for some wine and pizza while supporting a local business.",

My room mates and I went to Cibo on a thursday night and got right in as we chose to sit inside, i.e.. the place was not swamped as it is on a weekend night. We waited so long to even be helped in the first place that had to finally ask someone if we HAD a server as we would liked to have ordered a bottle of wine. When we ordered apps, as we couldn't pronounce what we wanted, we pointed it out on the menu to the server, so she clearly saw it. However when an antipasti platter came out and we said that wasn't our order, the food runner took it back to our server, who brought it back out to us and continued to argue with us that we did in fact order the antipasti, which we hadn't. Our pizza took so long we actually had time to finish the bottle of wine and could have fallen over if we'd gotten any eye contact or mention of our pizza and where it may have gone. I don't care how amazing the food or how popular the restaurant, servers with poor attitudes are never worth the time and money.",

We have been going for years and between our friends we tried everything on the menu. I  keep having the margherita and it is amazing.The sauce is just right,the fresh mozzarella is to die for, the the fresh basil leaves on top and the crust send me in culinary haven. The prices are good for the quality ingredients ,atmosphere and service. This is the pizza you dream off and can't wait to go back!!

Very attentive at the beginning, forgot about us throughout the meal but showed up again at the check/dessert time.  We had the Burrata with proscuitto for an app., which was awesome, melt in your mouth, almost sweet cheese, and the proscuitto was like pork butter, lovely.  The pizzas were good but not what i expected when i hear thin crust.  The ingredients were definately quality but the crust was a little fluffy and chewy for my taste.  Bianco still tops the charts on pizza, but for the lack of wait, and quality of food, ambiance, and service i would definately recommend Cibo.  I plan on going back to try some more selections.",

    "text": "I'm really torn with Cibo's. The first time I went there was after a First Friday. Perhaps the crowd had thinned out some, but we were seated inside in the right-hand side room. The ambiance was great. Our server was friendly, informative, and attentive. My friends and I got a great bottle of wine and some appetizers. The pizza I got was the special of the night: pesto with grape tomatoes, baked and then topped with slowly melting boccincini mozzarella balls and pine nuts. It was excellent. A huge fave. I left a big fan and raved about it to other friends of mine. \r \r A return trip was in order. But this time all went wrong. Really wrong. Our waitress was a complete space cadet who didn't once tell us what the specials were and would disppear at odd times, raising our tweak alert. We were seated at the same table as last time, but this time the side room was full and so damn loud that we were straining to hear ourselves talk. Everyone at the other tables decided to compensate for the noise by raising their voices and thus making things even worse. So, to say the least, we were stuck in an endless cyclone of noise, getting stronger and stronger by the minute - fueled by all the hot, loud earsplitting air being exhaled by 20 people. We were miserable. We ordered a margherita, a quattro fromaggi, a proscuitto, and a sausage pizza. Three of the four came back with the crusts completely charred. I don't mind a little burn here and there - I like the crust a little crunchy, but this was ridiculous. Not helped that the waitress was serving our pizzas by reaching over the table and putting her arms smack in front of our faces. Talk about disappointment, and a shot-down credibility on my part because I took three friends who expected great things.\r \r So I've got two trips to Cibo's which ended up on the opposite ends of the spectrum, even though I sat at the exact same table. Thus the three stars is an average of the two. Don't know if it's worth another go around. Maybe on a slow weeknight when tweaker chick is off tweaking elsewhere. \r \r Too bad. The co-owner knew it, too, when she hesitatingly asked us how that second night went. I wish I could have said \"Great\" but I had to be honest. I could see the disappointment on her face, but hey, still not as disappointed as me.",

Was it an aberration? Will I look douchey to someone else who, based on more visits, has deemed this place mediocre?  But if you had the grilled spek sandwich (proscuitto, tomatoes, cheese) that I just had on the sublimely amazing bread they have at cibo, you would indeed feel it obligatory to give them all five stars.  The fruit that is served w/ the meal was whatever but I don't care, because it has been a long time since I had a sandwich that good.",

With seasons tickets to the Diamondbacks he can meet me at Cibo for dinner before he catches a night game.  I love Cibo's location in downtown Phoenix.  I love that it's in an old house.  I love the staff--so welcoming.  My grandfather is a little disappointed that they only serve wine and beer so that he can't get a gin and tonic, but I like sitting at the bar and drinking a slow glass of wine.  The food has always been delicious (we're pretty snobby when it comes to any kind of Italian fare...)",

My husband, daughter and I drove up to a beautifully lit yard with music and people sitting around a fire pit all happy in conversation.  We had a wait, not too long, but the music and great wine helped it pass quickly.  The owners were in and out checking on everything:) We were seated inside the house next to a table of locals who made us feel as though we were at a comfortable dinner party.  We ate wonderful food in an atmosphere that made us feel relaxed and at home. When we left we were all smiles as the owner hugged me and said goodbye and our new friends at the table next to us did the same.  Fantastic dining experience!",

Try the margarita pizza for a taste of a pure italian wood fired pizza.  Each serves 1-2 people.  Local favorite.",

Also has a small bar and outdoor seating (with heaters for the winter).  The pizza, salads and dessert are all fantastic, they have a pretty good beer selection and the wait at dinner is never more than about an hour. I guess my only complaints would be the parking...just like anywhere else downtown it's limited; and it can get a bit loud inside when it's busy.   Thinking about taking your date/out of town guests to Biancos?  Don't bother...head over to Cibos for better food, better atmosphere, and a shorter wait.",

Mozzarella (that's what they call the cat) came and sat on my girlfriends daughter's lap. We hadn't ordered yet so it was ok. Then the cat left to the grass and allowed us to enjoy our meal.",

I think it's way better that Pizza Bianco. The selection is far greater, the staff is friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is welcoming. I love that the outside dining area is smoke-free. This is one of my favorite places to go. The crepes are amazing. We ordered the banana & nutella crepe and added strawberries on top. This is the kind of place where you can enjoy yourself and relax.

Love the outdoor seating and the decor. One complaint is that a homeless person wandered into the outdoor seating area and the waitstaff let her hang around for an HOUR! They gave her water and she sat down by the fire and they never asked her to leave. It was really awkward and uncomfortable and the guests at the birthday party were weirded out, as was I. Still giving Cibo 5 stars because the food was impeccable nonetheless.",

There is a server named Tom who is severely lacking the \"service industry\" bone... He is by far the worst server there. He has ruined several of our experiences. To the point that we specifically request to not be seated in his area. When we complained about him we were told that he is apart of the owners family. Despite the many complaints he is still in the front of the house. So sad. His communication skills are more suited for the computer world. Today is mother's day and I brought my family there to eat. The food was cold and we were surrounded by flies inside of the restaurant. Horrible first time experience for my family. We keep trying to give cibo the benefit of the doubt but we are running low on chances as of now.  I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer. The service and quality of food is not consistent.",

Funny, sad, etc. But I thought I'd put a different twist on it since I'm not looking to leave anyone any time soon. I had a lunch meeting here instead (sorry Jason).   We decided to eat outside on the patio and I was immediately reminded of that nuisance that is Phoenix restaurant misters in the summer. We had to move tables cause it would have been hard to have a lunch meeting, take notes, etc with our papers soaked! But really that shouldn't be a slam against Cibo per say because I know sooo many restaurants use those wasteful, ineffective, highly annoying devices.  Anyways...once we moved tables I really loved the ambience. The patio is gorgeous. I ate under a big tree that looked like you could climb in it, read a book, and be perfectly content.   I had a salad (I can't remember the name now) with apples, candied walnuts, and gorgonzola cheese. It was delish!! The iced tea was amazing as well. Our server was really pleasant and not over attentive or too chatty, as she recognized that we were there to talk shop.   I didn't get to poke around inside too much. But a restaurant in an old home seems to work well for Phoenix.   We went at about 1:30pm and there was a small crowd. It seemed to be about the perfect time to hit them up. Enjoy!!",

    "text": "\"Kismet:  (Islam) the will of Allah  - kismat  An event (or a course of events) that will inevitably happen in the future  - destiny, fate\"   That's the word that popped into my head after a wonderful evening at Cibo. A motley group of friends met up for dinner and left very, very happy.   We met around 7pm at Cibo. We were immediately seated at the front of the house next to the bar. The bartender was our waiter and he was super friendly and very helpful. We decided to each order a pizza so that plates could be passed around and pizzas shared! I'm glad that was what the decision was because I tried several different pizzas that night.   The server was very helpful in selecting the wine that I chose to drink that night. He asked me what I liked to drink as far as American standards and suggested great Italian wines. He even came to suggest certain pizzas as well as aperitifs!   I ordered the Bruschetta... it was delicious. The entire table enjoyed that appetizer. Once the main meals arrived, we realized that appetizers weren't needed.   For my meal I ordered the Prosciutto Crudo. The dough was well cooked but not too hard that you could take a good chewy/smoky bite out of it. There were plenty of toppings and everything was high quality. I was amazed!   At the end of the meal we just HAD to indulge in the crepes. I chose the Nutella and chocolate crepe....heaven. Of course I shared and everyone agreed that the crepe was amazing.   To finish our dining experience off, we indulged in aperitifs of Lemoncello and some kind of yummy chocolate liqueur.   Of course from start to finish I was happy. Our service was spot on, the food was FANTASTIC, and the drinks were wonderful. It was fate that our crew hit that spot right then, right there... I honestly do not have one complaint, one criticism, one bad thing to say about Cibo.  I hope to catch a moment of kismet again!",

We then tried all kinds of different pizza which was all pretty good. I would not say the best pizza I have ever had but pretty good. We got a couple of deserts that were made from crepes which were good as well. Not to die for deserts. Overall great spot. Would go back again.",

I felt like I was sitting in my own front yard catching up with a Lon lost friend over lunch. The food was good but overhyped. Judging from reviews I honestly expected more and so did my taste buds. But the atmosphere was nice and the hot sandwich just okay.  I'd recommend if you prefer a more serene and less crowded lunch date.",

    "text": "Felt like I was back in Italy!  Very authentic menu, just like you would find in Italy.  The Pizze Bianche (white pizza) is more of a olive oil based pizza as apposed to a more traditional red marinara sauce or even an alfredo sauce pizza.  They are delicious and very traditional!  You cant go wrong with any of their choices.  The wine list was very nice and the pinot noir we enjoyed was excellent.  The waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable and helped us with our selection quite a bit.  This is a very popular spot in downtown Phoenix, so if going on a Fri or Sat night, expect to wait a little.  We waited (with a glass of wine) about 20 min to get a seat for two at the peak time on a Fri, but was well worth it!  The outside seating was very pretty and the whole establishment was quaint and really took you away to Europe.",

Upon arrival, we were told it was going to be a glass of wine wait so thirty minutes later and a glass of wine, we were seated at a nice table in the front of the restaurant.   Our waitress Jessica was extremely attentive, friendly and helpful.   Shared a few salads and three pies.   The caprese was mediocre along with the sausage pie(not going to spell it correctly) but diavola and capricosa were great.   Really liked the flavor and crust.   Very nice interior and pleasant staff, had it not been as cold as it was, the outdoor seating looked very inviting.",

This is a great place for sharing. My favorite night at Cibo goes like this... The delicious pesto salad. ( I am not usually a big salad person but this one is quite interesting.) Then on to the pizza. I generally get the margherita pizza but had the diavola the other day and now I am hooked. For desert all of the crepes are amazing. And if you've never had limoncello I highly recommend you try it! And of course you can always share a bottle of wine for dinner.   Great food, reasonable prices and beautiful patio!",

My boyfriend told her it was my birthday, and she said, \"....ok. I'll bring something out at the end.\" She didn't not even look at me or say Happy Birthday. Okay whatever. We ordered the Palline 2.0, the fried dough with a side of Nutella, and a pizza that had potatoes and sausage on it.   The fried dough: I expected it to be soft and fluffy...but it was a lot harder than I thought. It was hard to chew.  Pizza: Meh...It was good? But it didn't really have a taste to it. I can taste the potatoes a little, but the cheese flavor was very mellow, and so was the sausage surprisingly. I did, however, taste the burnt crust very well.   Free Nutella crepe: At least I got this for free for my birthday...but the crepe isn't as good as other ones I've tried.  The entire time, our server didn't not ONCE look at me...WHY? My goodness...how upsetting. If I wasn't trying to have a nice birthday dinner, I would give it 1 or 2 stars.",

It's a cool old house, and probably not a place I would ever stop if not for the amazing reviews (which were spot on by the way).  Within fifteen minutes I was enjoying one of the best pizza pies I've tasted in Arizona... and the gorgonzola almost threw me off.  I'm glad I went with my instinct, the pie was perfectly cooked and the flavors were out of sight.    Add to this an ice cold bottle of Peroni - and I was quite pleased with my decision.  Between this and Pomo, I'm convinced that it's the best couple of pies within a half mile anywhere in AZ.  COME EAT HERE!  You won't regret it.  Also, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but if you like Nutella, you must try their Nutella crepe... it's pretty freaking tasty!",

The problem with it was once she checked on my beer choice that was the lady time I saw her until I was completely finished. Small mistake to an almost perfect meal.  The food was insane-very tasty!! The pizza combined typical Flavors of fresh sauce and cheese with pepperoni with less used ingredients of blue cheese and raw garlic. Crust had a perfect chewiness. Very good.  There beer selection was ok-really would have preferred a draft selection but they did have great selection of local bottled beers.  All in all a nice meal",

There are SO many reviews, I will just give you a few tidbits that stood out to me: - there is no chicken on the menu, so if you're going to order a salad, forget chicken.. you'll get prosciutto or sausage but no chicken... but their Omero Salad was *outstanding*.. delicious and so flavorful and great mix of textures and flavors - place is adorable, small and intimate.. and at a 100 years old, there's no sound absorption.. my cackles were resounding... I had to purposely laugh softly (very hard for me!)... FYI - you can do half-half pizza orders...  I tried a slice of all the 5 pizzas at our table and found them all unique, flavorful, and definitely delicious - their Il Tagliere meat and cheese board is a fantastic appetizer idea.. burrata was outstanding and loved by all  We would absolutely come here again!",

We called ahead and made reservations for our group of 7 and were seated right away when we arrived. Unfortunately their parking lot was full, but we were able to find street parking not too far away. First off, it was way way too hot and stuffy in there. They really need to work on their air conditioning, or at least get some fans in there to circulate some air. Second, the finishing on their tables makes them appear dirty. It was so sticky and uncomfortable. We tried cleaning it, but it is just the table finish. Even the napkins stuck to the table. Third, I had my one year old son with me and no one ever offered a high chair. We eventually found one on our own. Fourth, it took forever for the waitress to come see us and get our drink orders.   In regards to the food, I had the pizza and it was decent. Nothing too amazing, but it was good and it was gone before we left. As a group we also tried their crepe, which was also tasty, but not worth the money in my opinion. The thing I loved the most about this place is its location and decor. It is located in an old house with a lot of charm. I love the bar area as well, maybe I'll try to come again sometime for drinks and an appetizer. Overall though, I was just not impressed...",

    "text": "Cibo provided a mixed experience on a Sunday night.  My son enjoyed his pizza, Da Vinci (?), while my DIL was disappointed with her Di Norte.  The child's pizza looked good and was enormous.   My pasta and red sauce was very nice.   Service was good, price point was excellent, and the atmosphere was casual and comfortable.  Sitting outside was lovely.    I looked forward to a Crepe Suzette and introducing my family to this delicacy. The Crepe Suzette was a disaster.  The server couldn't get the syrup to light in order to flambe, which destroyed the presentation, in addition to the flavor.  The syrup didn't have the rich fragrance of Grand Marnier, just alcohol, the crepe had marmalade in it instead of the decadent orange, butter syrup, and was a soggy, doughy mess.  My DIL described it has an alcohol soaked tortilla.",

But there were so many people in this little room that it was warm so it made it uncomfortable.  Our waitress was polite. A little timid which sometimes made her unhelpful but all in all she was ok.  We got a appetizer which was this fried rice ball with cheese. Nothing special. Pretty bland. And we got two different pizzas the margarita and the pesto potato one.  The margarita pizza was awful!!!! It had so much sauce that was the wrong consistency on it that it made the pizza a instant droopy mess and totally soggy. It was gross. The pesto potato pizza was actually very good and it is what we ended up eating. The rest of everything else we just left there and was a total waste.  We probably won't go back here just cause there is definite better options out there then the experience we had here.",

Cibo has excellent pizza, the closest to actual Italian style you'll find in the valley. They have a great wine list and also have gluten-free options now, which is really nice! I've also had great service. Their outside eating area is one of the more romantic and fun spots in the valley and is perfect for dining during the Phoenix \"winter\".",

Haha we got a salad (I forgot the name) but it was almost like a Caesar but not quite and still to me even better!  The pizza we got was a Diavola? With added Italian sausage. The pizza was gone in minutes!. It was really good the salami had a small kick but a good kick. You can tell everything was fresh the taste was just so much better. The crust I loved it wasn't too crispy but just right.  Dessert we got a Nutella Crepe with Ice Cream. Omg! Love love this simple dessert!   The only reason why no 4 stars I got a latte and that was no Bueno. And parking is all street parking. The waitress at first was a little rude but then that's her fault she didn't ask if we have been there before especially since we were asking amateur questions. Lol other than those will be coming back for more.",

    "text": "I really want to give this place a higher score, but I'm torn because while I have been here a great many times, and often bring visiting friends and family, I was pretty peeved at the service last Friday night 6-12-2015.   I genuinely got the feeling that the management had taken the night off, and the inmates were running the asylum because despite the fact that the place was somewhat empty by the time we got there, late in the evening, the front-of-house staff was out-to-lunch so to speak.  The place was really noisy despite being half empty. The water they brought was warm as were the three glasses they brought. We also had to push pushes to the adjoining empty table because the staff wasn't removing them.  One thing they don't put on the menu is that if you opt to order a Coca-Cola vs. say some beer, etc., the soda comes in a can (which had a weird smell to it), and at $2 for a can and a warm glass, it's a pretty extreme 10x markup.  Food-wise, the pizza to get remains the tricolore.  We tried the arancini as an appetizer, and it lacked seasoning. The server brought a small tin of marina, which wasn't enough for the 4 balls, and when we asked for more, they failed to bring more. In the end, we didn't finish the appetizer because the balls got cold.  My father got the bolognese, which I didn't try, though he said mine had more flavor.  I'd really like to try the other pasta dish sometime, as it looks quite good.  It would seem this restaurant has seen better days, but I'm not sure. If they make some small changes in the kitchen and retrain the wait staff, it might be worth visiting again.",

The homemade pasta is good but I promise you won't be disappointed by the pizza. I also love the house salad..its so simple yet delicious due to the fresh shaved parmesan and its so much more than a house salad. This is a great special occasion place but that doesn't mean we don't just go on a Tuesday! One tip...its pretty hot here in the summer due to it being an old house.",

Live music in the patio and beautiful lighting/atmosphere helped pass the time.  Sat at a table near the bar, greeted by the waiter and promptly served waters and given menus. Started with the 3 bruschetta appetizer. Delicious! Prosciutto and fresh mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and basil, and a savory bean topping. For pizzas we ordered the Rustica and another with prosciutto and Italian sausage. Crispy crust and fresh ingredients, what more could you ask for? The arugula on the Rustica was a nice green and great aroma.  Cheese was perfectly melted as well. For dessert, enjoyed a simple Nutella crepe (light and fluffy) with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream.    The lighting and decor of the refurbished homestyle restaurant is comfortable and inviting. Definitely recommend for an evening out and delicious food.",

    "text": "We have been to Cibo many times, we have also rented out the Carriage House for our company Christmas party and have never had any issues, ever. Until today.   Grab yourself a nice glass of wine, pair it with an assortment of exceptional cheeses, and have a seat for this glorious experience.   We walked into Cibo, were immediately greeted by the hostess; she was very welcoming, a smile on her face, sat us within a few minutes of our arrival. Then, boys and girls came our waiter, Ross. He had a smile on his face, seemed welcoming, however, the freshly smoked cigarette odor lingering off of him was extremely unpleasant. Restaurant dining is meant to excite your senses; sight, smell, taste, touch. I mean, there is nothing like, here is your glass of iced tea, with my cigarette fingers all over it.  We were a table of 4, we all ordered our individual dinners, three ordered salads, as an appetizer, in addition to their dinner. Out came their salad AND my dinner. Wait, why is my dinner coming out with their salad you ask? Not quite sure kids. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen. I asked a different staff member to take back my meal, as the rest of the parties dinner had not arrived at the table, and that they were just served their salad. The look of bewildered confusion came upon her face. She took back my dinner, and out came our waiter, Ross telling me that \"it would be five minutes tops\" before the rest of my parties dinner came out if I can just leave my hot sandwich in front of me until their food came out. Well, fifteen minutes went by, their dinner never appeared. We asked Ross to take back my dinner, as it was now cold, also because the rest of the parties dinner has yet to come out. During this wait, the parties dinner came out, with mine in the abyss of the kitchen. Almost fifteen minutes went by, my dinner never made it out of the kitchen. I asked Ross for the manager. She came to the table, with a smirk on her face. I told her what is going on. Wait for this.... she did not even apologize, or offer to make it right. She stood there with her smirky face, saying something about the way the kitchen works. Not my problem. During all of this banter, my dinner finally made its way to the table. The manager never offered to make the situation right.   Listen, I was not looking to have been offered anything for free, or have my meal comped. I just wanted my dinner at the same time the rest of my party was eating their dinner. I did not want to sit and eat my dinner, while they are eating their appetizer. A simple sincere apology would have made it better.   Needless to say, we will never again step one foot into this establishment. As a paying customer, there are plenty of options for dining in this city. I get better customer service at my local grocery store then I did in this restaurant. We have rented the Carriage House for a company Christmas party, I promise you this, they have lost all future business. We work hard for our money, and it will never again be spent at Cibo.   To the manager; not sure what your name is, you need to educate yourself on proper customer service etiquette. The way you treated me was horrendous and extremely unprofessional. You never made it right. You never even returned back to our table after our dinner was finally served, just to ask how everything was. Shame on you. What kind of example are you setting for your staff? To lack empathy to the customer. Shame on you.",

They have opted for smaller servings, their bread and pizza is inconsistently cooked each time, and to be specific their calamari has gotten to sports bar standards. All this can be overlooked because we love the atmosphere and overall the food still tastes good. However, when this is paired with horrible service and rude employees it's definitely enough to make us not come back. The food is brought out too quickly and thrown on the tables and they check back too inconsistently. Not to mention our food is brought out at inordinate times, we have found ourselves with a full table with unfinished salads, cold appetizers and a hot pizza if we are lucky. This is not pleasant it's as if they want us to leave and do so quickly all the time. This happened on many occasions, too many times. If you don't ask specifically for when you'd like things to be brought out you won't enjoy your stay. Also the servers all seem angry or uncomfortable, and it's very unpleasant not to see anyone smile. All they have to do is be a lot more attentive and kind. We just had this happen to us again on a slow Sunday night at a reasonable hour so customer traffic has not made a difference. Just please have better service and have people who actually want to be there.",

The pizza that has pears and arugula on it was good the very first time we went but this time was just LOADED with arugula and they put it on right before bringing it out vs right after it came out of the oven. So it never wilted. The pizza just didn't seem very fresh and was fairly dry.  We also had the antipasto and it was fairly lackluster with unripened olives all over. Huge ratio of olives to everything else. A bit stingy with the meat.  Service was sterile. Still not sure who our server was. We probably had 3-4 diff people come by from time to time. Had to get up and find someone to ask for a check. Being seated outside here you really feel like you're fairly forgotten about.  Hopefully won't be back. Too many better offerings now in the valley for pizza.",

As I was walking here from my hotel (16 minutes away) I thought I had gotten lost because it just somehow turned into a neighborhood. Very cute place and tucked away; I guess it used to be a house!  I got the Lunch Di Notte Pizza and it was delicious. Buttery cheese, salty, and sweet. If you drizzle it with some olive oil it's perfection! The crust is charred wonderfully and there's just something about this place that makes you happy every time you take a bite. Great flavors. Simple and not overpowering.  You don't need to order anything else for lunch, it was the perfect portion to make me feel satisfied.   The bartender served me cause I sat alone at the bar and she provided great service. The hostess was nice too but a Welcome or a Good Bye would've been nice (yes, I notice those things -1 Star).  I would be more than happy to return if I ever ended up in Phoenix again!",

A huge portion at a reasonable price.  I had the tartufata pizza.  I loved the white truffle oil.  It would have been great to have porcini mushrooms rather than cremini mushrooms, but it was great nonetheless.  We also had the calzone and vegetarian pizzas.  They were also very good.  The limoncello wasn't great -- they use Everclear which is too harsh of a liquor.  They have a great selection of wines.  Good values and less common finds in the US.  Our server was very good, it was very busy, so he wasn't always right there, but made sure that we were always taken care of and the food came out on time and hot.",

Other reasons why I like it: - cheap, good bottles of wine - dog friendly - light rail accessible - romantic vibe (but not too romantic, totally ok for just casual dining with friends) - friendly staff - free of Old Town Scottsdale douchery - desserts with nutella - fresh & often local ingredients - no ridiculous wait times like Bianco (usually 30 min or less during peak times)  Highly recommended.",

Ok so the place and atmosphere was probably my favorite thing about the experience... I just like being in old buildings... this one was built in 1913... so I personally enjoyed just looking around. Plenty of seating inside or out... so thats all good...  The food was pretty good, I would not go back to order the Margharita pizza again, but I'll definitely go back to check out the rest of the menu... just to throw this out there... there is another very well known pizza spot down the road in which I WOULD go back just to get some more of that Margharita pizza... this one is good, but not as good as the place down the road! The Genova was freakin great... pesto, mozzarella, onion, potato... kind of like we had in italy... No regrets about the food, it was good, the salad was $14 which was good, but not 14 bucks good! The pizza is worth the trip and the money. If you read my reviews i base my rating on my desire to return... i give it 4 stars because the food was good enough that I'll definitely go back to taste the rest of that good sized menu, but not 5 because it wasn't upto par with other pizza ive had around the area!   *** i will say this though... CIbo seems more accommodating for larger parties... just sayin'.",

I know it's strange for a pizza to be juicy, so let me explain...the fresh ingredients melting perfectly in the brick oven for an incredible burst of flavors in your mouth - JUICY!!! For apps I was introduced to the Burrata, which is outstanding and give the bruschetta and caprese a try, also yummy. Dessert wise the crepes with nutella are lip-smacking good as well as the nutella shake. (yep, I'm a fan of nutella)  Delightful atmosphere, patio lit with strands of lights, charming historic house inside.  Sometimes they have live music but I'm not sure how to find out this information. Also, they serve homemade pasta on a selected day :)",

First off the crust is very hard and chewy, your jaw becomes sore after half a slice. Not sure what they put in their dough but this is way too tough (maybe need a little more yeast?)  It's almost like eating a cold hard sourdough with tomato sauce on it.  The toppings were non existent, a few little sprinkles of sausage, and pepperoni that's it!  The sauce bland, and the cheese just okay, We ordered the meat combo, I don't mind paying for good quality, but for this small little pizza, and for the little amount of topping this was unacceptable.  I have been to good quality \"wood fired\" pizzerias and they were loaded with toppings and full of flavor and wonderful sauce and cheeses. Cibo pizza lacked in all areas, I will not come here again - the ambiance was quaint and nice however the pizza and salads and the rest of the fare is unacceptable.    1 Star for the ambiance  1 Star for the pizza  I will not be back...unless I am going for drinks..",

Probably the only thing I might not order again would be the pear salad as it didn't seem to be the greatest value.  The pizzas and crepe were PERFECT!  Soft, yet chewy crust delicately supporting the toppings with just a bit of gorgonzola on the quattro pizza!",

If you don't get there semi early though, they typically run out by 6 or 7 on Fridays and Saturdays.  All of the pizzas I've had are super tasty, with local ingredients for toppings.  My favorite has to be the Diavolo with ricotta.  The salami has a nice spicy kick and the ricotta balances it out nicely.  Its a little warm during the summer, as most of the seating is outside.  But once the sun goes down and they turn on the decorative lighting, you forget you're in downtown Phoenix.  I'd recommend this place over Pizzeria Bianco anytime.  Half the wait and twice as good.",

Six of us dining and requested two bills. A tip was added onto both bills, but it was not easy to see that it was added...two of us looked for it before adding a tip and neither of us saw that it was added. Of course the server did NOT have the courtesy to tell us. We added 20% and she still didn't say a thing, resulting in an almost 40% tip!! I tip very well if the service is good, but I'm very disappointed that a server wouldn't point out that it is included in the bill already. We had to find her and request a partial refund of our double tip, which was embarrassing. She knew exactly what she was doing. Management be aware of your employees pulling this on customers.",

    "text": "What to say that hasn't been said? My husband and I visited Cibo by chance. We had driven by about a year before while we were kind of lost downtown, and said \"that place is really busy, we'll have to try it some time.\" I am SO happy that we did tonight. We were seated promptly outside tucked in the corner. It's December, so you would think we would be chilly, we kept our jackets on during dinner but there are plenty of heaters surrounding the outside tables, so we were kept warm. The ambiance is beautiful, the outside tables are lit how you wish every restaurant you visit would be.     I had the green tea, real tea, nothing that they bring you in a bag, but they actually pour the hot water over the real tea leaves, it was very good. My husband said the coffee was rather good as well.   As an appetizer we split the pear salad: Spinach, vinaigrette, almonds, cheese, pears and honey. I'm not horribly adventurous when it comes to mealtime so I was nervous, but it was so good.   I'd say 1 pizza can heartily feed 2 people, but we opted for separate ones to try anyway. I had the Salsiccia (sausage, mozzarella, and red sauce), while my husband opted for the Salsiccia con Patate (sausage, roasted potatoes). The crust is soft and chewy, not overdone like so many places. His was a bit drier than mine, no sauce, but both were still good and we walked away with a whole pizza left over between the two of us, yummy yummy left overs!   The Dessert: All we could say was \"Oh My!\" We had the Fresca Crepe. A delicious crepe filled with vanilla ice cream and fruit, topped with whipped cream and more fruit. Fresh peaches, kiwi, and strawberries. We had the Nutella on the side but it was quite good drizzled on top. I'd go back for the dessert alone!  Our server, James, was very polite and there was one girl going around always asking people if they needed more water. I never felt neglected by the waitstaff and it is Friday night after all.   Overall, I have to say this is a favorite thus far!",

    "text": "This place is awesome! It's very quaint as it is a house converted into a restaurant. We sat outside but didn't realize that there had been construction being done on the street. At times it was so loud we just didn't bother to try and repeat what we had said. The other thing was the offensive smell! The dumpster sits right by the parking lot of the restaurant and if you sit outside you get a disgusting whiff of it every once in a while. Very unappetizing.   The food itself is delicious! I got the mele salad which has caramelized walnuts, blue cheese, and apple slices. The dressing perfectly complimented the other ingredients. The pizza was had a delicious crust and ooey gooey cheese. One of the better specialty pizzas I've had.   Definitely would go back and have!",

They menu offers a variety of flavor combinations that one would never think of when cooking at home.  The service staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. They have great suggestions and offer explanations of the ingredients in English.   The moscato de asti is WONDERFUL. It is so sweet and goes so well with any meal. It is very reasonably priced and is more cost efficient when ordered by the bottle.  Be adventurous, try something new, DONT ASK FOR RANCH and make sure you order the nutella and banana crepe for dessert!",

    "text": "I typically agree with Yelp ratings, so the cognitive dissonance I've experienced twice now going to Cibo is really strange for me. I have to chalk it up to going both times during lunch, when they don't serve pizza, because people seem to be crazy for the pizza here, but everything I've had at this place just plain sucks. From a mushy \"meatball\" sandwich that played more like an Italian sloppy joe to the criminally dry, flavorless salad topped stingily with tiny, cold chunks of bland chicken. I don't have any good words for any of the entrees I have tried here and nothing my companions ordered looked especially appealing either.  Oh cool! They start you out with some bread on a cutting board. Ask them for butter though, and you'll be informed that they don't have any. No butter! A restaurant that is devoid of butter. Let me talk about this for a second. First of all, I don't believe it, so just right there, I think you're lying to me. Saying \"our policy is to not give our customers butter when they ask for it\" doesn't sound so good though, so I understand. The service was otherwise acceptable, if not terribly friendly.  If you ask me, and I know I'm only one small voice amid a chorus of four and five star reviews, this place is long on atmosphere and location and short on everything else. Expensive prices for the stingy portions of mediocre food. I don't even know if I'll go back for the pizza.",

    "text": "Man... what happened?  My wife and I felt pretty bad, after hyping Cibo up to friends for the past couple weeks, only to be treated fairly strangely and shabbily by our waiter. We were the only two in our group who had been there before, and luckily the only ones embarrassed when things did not go as smoothly as we would've hoped.  Our large party would agree that the food and the atmosphere are still top notch, as are the wines and that delicious homemade limoncello... But the service just fell off, due to one person in particular. Read Nader A's review for the full story, but the gist of it is there was a (rude) miscommunication on the waiter's part, and he was so steadfast (attitude) about not admitting his mistake that it cost him any additional tip he might have received. He also chose to do this at peak volume coinciding with the entertainer's break, so not only did everyone at our table get an earful, but so did the surrounding patrons. it was like a scene in a movie when a bunch of people who do not belong walk into the wrong bar and the needle scratches right off the record. To Nader A's credit, he remained cool, but the damage was done. Later on we found out that our waiter also dissuaded others at the table from customizing their pizzas because \"they are perfect the way they are.\" I don't know if he had something else going on and decided to take it out on us, but to snap at us the way he did was truly unacceptable.  We were planning on having the table sample some of Cibo's delicious crepes for dessert, and I'm positive we would have certainly drank a bit more as well, but instead we chose to leave early and take our business elsewhere. Will we be back? Eventually, but in all honesty not anytime soon, and definitely not in that guy's section.  I in no way would dissuade anyone from trying out Cibo. They excel at what they do, and my experience was most likely out of the ordinary.",

    "text": "Cibo is just a couple blocks from my office and I have to say it's some damn good pizza. I visited there with a couple work buddies for their birthday party a couple months ago. The owners were there hobnobbing with the patrons as the passed out FREE Margherita pizza and two dollar beers. Good beer too! I got a Lagunita's Little Sumpin.   Aside from their awesome basically free birthday bash I have been several times before.  The starters are delicious and usually change with the season's (I believe). The charcuterie plate is a great way to get your night going with some red wine. It's called Il Tagliere and it really gets me going. The other starters are great too (honestly the starters are better than the pizza)  The pizza is delicious but not my favorite in the valley. They do Neapolitan style with a nice sweet dough that is a little chewy. I really can't say much about the pizza besides the fact that it is really good but i prefer the  za's at POMO, Bianco, and strangely La Grande Orange. That being said I have only tried the margherita and the fresco...  ALSO! If you happen to be there when they are serving pasta, ditch the pizza and get the pasta you will not regret it.",

    "text": "I keep meaning to review this place.  Every time I go, as I'm sitting, devouring what I have proclaimed \"might be my favorite pizza, ever.\", I commit to reviewing Cibo, but somehow, in my post-pizza bliss, I forget.  Not this time!  Time to give credit where credit is due.  Cibo is 100% adorable... the repurposed old house, the charming patio, the live music in the evenings.... just adorable.  It's small(ish) but I think that's part of it's charm.  Somehow we've been lucky and never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated, even on Friday and Saturday evenings.  (By the way... this is one of the main reasons I prefer Cibo over the highly-touted Pizzaria Bianco).    Antipasti-- I've had both the pear salad and the caprese salad and both are delicious.  Of the two, the pear salad is my favorite-- the honey adds an interesting element that compliments the rest of the salad nicely.    Pizza- La Noce is what I'm referring to as \"might be my favorite pizza, ever.\".  I love the flavor of the arugula, ricotta, and walnuts-- and the red sauce is perfect.-- an interesting blend of flavors that just works I've also tried the Pomodoro Fresco-- also delicious, but La Noce is still my favorite.  Others I've eaten with have ordered other pizzas as well and all have proclaimed them fabulous. The crust is perfectly done, thin without being soggy.    Service- The service is reliably good-- not amazing or remarkable, but good.  No issues here.    So if you like awesome pizza in an adorable atmosphere and you don't want to wait ages, this is your place.  Just do it-- you won't be sorry!",

    "text": "My wife and I traveled to Phoenix last week to spend Spring Break with my daughter who is attending ASU. During our visit we had the \"privilege\" of eating at Pizzeria Bianco Tuesday night... after a 2+ hour wait. My father had suggested we go eat there after seeing this place mentioned on one of his Food Network shows. I must say the atmosphere is decent, the service so so, and the pizza just OK.   So, the next night I took my wife to a place I had eaten at last summer named Cibo which is just a few blocks away. After the first taste of her Siena pizza she turned to me and said \"this place blows away Bianco\"... she is right.   When you are there you must try the Burrata appetizer. I had the pleasure of trying it last summer when it was just added to the menu and was glad to see it stuck around. I seriously doubt there is a pizza on the menu you will not like but that night we had the Diavola as well as the Siena mentioned above (both fabulous). Make sure to finish off the evening with some homemade Limoncello and you will gladly thank me later...  We got lucky enough to find a seat on the patio and were able to dine under a perfect Phoenix sky. Our server was named Melissa and she was great. She suggested the perfect wine for our meal and was very attentive the whole time we were there.   We cannot wait to go again!!!",

That being said, I absolutely love having lunch here the other day. I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really, really delicious.  I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable, though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby.",

But definitely a good decision to check out CIBO if you're in the mood for a good pizza in Phoenix! One key to good pizza is the dough and the crust is soft!  Great atmosphere, ambiance, quaint any time of the year. Love the outdoor seating on the patio with fire areas, live music and an assortment of lights. Service was okay, I had an empty water the whole meal.   I would definitely come back here and try some other pizzas and maybe an entree. For dessert, we had the strawberry banana crepe with Nutella - I mean a crepe with chcoclate, yum. But they were out of their other chocolate dessert :( Let me rewind back to appetizer, caprese salad is enough for a handful of people. The mozzarella tossed with pesto, oregano, EVOO, chopped fresh basil and grape tomatoes is absolutely scrumptious.   Check it out !",

Look no further Cibo is the place for you.   Every pizza on the menu at Cibo looks amazing. I cant wait to try them all.  So far my favorotes are the Salsiccia and and Diavola.  However, I would be neglectful if I  didn't' mention the calzones which are absolutely delicious, the best I ever had.  You have to start your meal with one  of Cibo's aperterisers.  Try the Arancini or Burrata, its more than enough for two people.  Cibo offers a modest  wine list at prices that  won't make you cringe  when you see them.    The serving sizes at Cibo are very generous, however that didn't stop us from ending the night with a fruit crepe which was more than enough for two people.  The service at Cibo is second to none.

The potato gnocchi was delicious, tender and plenty of sauce and mozzarella. We had a pizza halved between the red Diavlo and the white Tartufata, bon apetit! We sat outdoors which is somewhat secluded with the lit up treesand quiet chatter ambience. This place is a MUST! Erika was our waitress,she was superb!",

Food orders weren't taken accurately or timely and some people were billed incorrectly. The food was just okay... no one in our group raved about any of their items. Another bummer was that they only service wine and beer, but lacked a strong list of either. My bf and his friend hated the beer that the waiter recommended and I wasn't thrilled with their Sauvignon blanc. I had high hopes for this place bc of the great reviews but sadly it didn't live up to its stars.",

The parking lot is full of very nice BMWs and Audis. So it must have done something right.  The pizzas at Cibo remind me a lot of those at La Grande Orange: gourmet toppings, thin sourdough crust, and fragrant cheese. We ordered three pizzas for the table, all tasted great, except that... they were awfully similar.   Granted, I probably shouldn't expect too much of a variety when we were having pizzas (for a birthday celebration), but I was hoping for something life-changing, like the slice of pizza I had in Rome. Well, Cibo is no food hauled from Rome for sure, but it is nonetheless a good place to chill and get solid food in central Phoenix.",

They wanted us to have a great experience and gave us passionate recommendations! They are great!   ATMOSPHERE: This place is so warm and inviting!

The rice ball was a tad salty but still delicious. we ordered diavalo (spicy salami) and tartafata pizza. The spicy salami pizza was our favorite. It had just the right amount of kick to it. The tartafata was a bit too salty for us. We loved the thin crust pizza and had just enough sauce go with it.",

Exterior and location is one of a kind in the area--and appeared to be the only restaurant or just a generic place taking customers in.  We of course took advantage of the cute scenery outside and decided to eat near the band. The waiter was very accommodating and patient with our seating decisions since we became a bit indecisive on where we wanted to sit in order to enjoy the entire environment. Food! tried two of their pizzas: Margherita and Salsiccia Con Patate (sausage and roasted potatoes on their white sauce pizza, this was superb!!) I thought I would end up feasting on the Margherita in case the Salsiccia Con Patate didn't pan out well, but this ended up being the dish of the night.

I wanted to order a pizza but couldn't decide between the Funghi and the Da Vinci. The waitresses let me know you can you do half/half which is just what I ordered. I highly recommend the Da Vinci! My bf got the Genova, a pesto pizza, which he really liked! Also recommend the spicy oil as a nice dipping sauce! I will definitely be back to try the other menu options!",

    "text": "Came here for lunch while we were in Phoenix. We looked at restaurants in the area (downtown), and Cibo kept coming up due to the amount of reviews and the high ratings. Overall, I thought it was pretty good, especially relative to Phoenix restaurants.   FOOD: 4 stars. The food here was really good - better than I was expecting. The only thing I didn't like was the Bruschetta three ways. One piece comes with the traditional tomatoes, basil, and olive oil (really good), one piece had prosciutto (?) and cheese on it (second best, not great) and the third piece had something with olives on it. I didn't even try it because I absolutely hate olives. It would be a lot better if they stuck to the traditional tomato, basil, olive oil one. The Caprese Salad was also really good and it came as a pretty large portion. we ordered the pizza due to the recommendation by our server. The pizza was really good, especially for having no pizza sauce. It was light and didn't give us a food coma feeling. The only drawback was that their lunch menu didn't offer any pasta, which was a little disappointing. Apparently they make their own pasta in house for dinner only, which I really wanted to try but didn't get to. Everything we ordered was really good and I would order it again!   SERVICE: 4 stars. Service was really good and really patient. I appreciated our sever's patience while we had a lot of questions and a lot of requests. Everything came out quickly and was really good!  LOCATION: 4 stars. Cute restaurant but I was so confused walking up to it. I thought it was someone's house, honestly. It was hard to find the actual front door for the main restaurant, because there is a smaller side of the place adjacent to it.   This place is really good and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for Italian food in the area.",

I will give them a 5 out of 5 on service and ambiance.  We sat out on the patio with twinkling lights and live music from the flute player. A very nice and romantic setting.  We had the meatballs for a starter and they were really good and a very generous portion. We had to take some home in order to not spoil our appetite for the pizza.   We got the capricciosa pizza that has mozzarella, prosciutto cotto, artichoke, black olives, and mushrooms. I guess it's  shame on me for not realizing that prosciutto cotto was not prosciutto as I know it but sliced deli meat ham, and the artichoke tasted like it came out of a jar. Over all the pizza lacked any distinguishing flavors, very bland and a lack of texture in the toppings.  The pizza crust was thin and crispy, maybe we just ordered the wrong thing?   I won't say don't go, but I'm not rushing to go back.",

The restaurant is tucked away on a residential street, but the outdoor lighting and patio seating give it away.  Misting devices are sprinkled throughout for dining out on those hot summer nights.  The decor inside is quaint and cozy.  The staff were friendly and the food came out promptly.   I wouldn't hesitate to return.",

    "text": "Been here once before and enjoyed it so took friends Frid. night (Jan. 20th).  One of the friends has Celiac's Disease and therefore must eat a gluton-free diet, which I inquired about the previous night I was there.  I called ahead to confirm their gluton-free menu and a very snotty girl informed me they \"could make anything on their menu gluton-free\" and they \"did not take reservations.\"  We arrived at 7PM and were told of a 30 min. wait; 1 hr. later we were seated.  Another 10 mins. and a waitress asked about drinks and we ordered a bottle of wine and menus.  Another 15 mins. later our wine was brought and immediately opened, and when we asked about the gluton-free menu again, the waitress told us \"Oh, unfortunately we're all out of our gluton-free dough.  In fact two people before you just asked and couldn't get any.\"  She stared at us expecting to order something else, to which my friend said \"it's not like it's a diet I'm on, it's a lifestyle.  I can't eat anything then.\"  So after all that we walked out, drove to La Grande Orange on 40th St. & Camelback (known for it's fantastic gluton-free pizzas) and had a wonderful time.   Note to Cibo:  for a restaurant that RUDELY tells you they can make anything gluton-free, and at $15 to $16 for a small pizza, you'd think you would make enough dough that you could afford to throw some out rather than run short on a weekend night!",

Honestly, I cannot think of one thing that I would change about the atmosphere, service or the food. The sandwiches at lunch are absolutely incredible, they actually bake the bread for each order, then assemble your sandwich (name one other restaurant that does that). I really try to give good feedback on Yelp, but this place is flawless.  That being said, don't go into it expecting it to be flawless- you're always disappointed when you do that (like an over-hyped movie). Expect it to be a solid \"8,\" and it will blow your mind. That's good advice that you can use in life ;-)",

    "text": "3 stars for food and ambience.  Minus 1 star for service.  Cibo is the average answer to Pizzeria Bianco.  I can't believe they've even been compared  - the only similarity I can think of is geography.  The crusts are worlds apart - at least on the night we went.   We chose to take some out of town guests to Cibo last night because of: (1) all the praises we read on Yelp and other media (2) the fact that it's one of the few well-regarded independent places open on a Monday night (3) it looked cute from the outside  Apparently, other people thought the same.  All the tables for four were full inside so we took a table in the patio, which turned out to be a blessing because we got lots of privacy to talk.    The downside though was getting the attention of the waiter.  Ice water was poured and menus were handed out as soon as we sat down but the waiter appeared over 15 min later.  When we ordered a refill on a glass of wine after the appetizer, he came with it almost at the end of our meal.  We order the antipasto speciale, large ($17) to share.  The plate was huge:  generous slices of prosciutto, 3 slices of bresaola with shaved pecorino on arugula, 4 slices of grilled zucchini,  mounds of balsamic pearl onions, giant olives, grilled red peppers with capers and parmesan, and cherry tomatoes with bocconcini and basil.  Pizzas are split between Rosse (red) and Bianche (white).  On the waiter's recommendation, we ordered these:  - Red: Diavola (tomato sauce, mozz and spicy salame)  $13 - White: Siena (grilled zucchini, mozz, speck (smoked proscuitto) and pecorino)  $14  VERDICT: Cibo vs Pizzeria Bianco  The toppings were generous and tasty but the major complaint we had was the CRUST.  Pizza's all about the crust.  This was more like charred bread - it was not crusty in the least bit.  The dough had a nice chew to it but no crunch whatsoever.    Chris Bianco's dough is so brilliant because there's an awesome contrast between the crusty exterior and the pillowy interior.  Chris' crust is so thin that you can inhale slice after slice but here we had trouble eating more than 2 slices.    Even though this pizza was baked in a brick oven, there was no smokiness to it - almost as if it was flash-baked.  Pizzeria Bianco's crust not only has texture but a complex-flavored interior and smoky exterior.  Eating pizza will never be the same again...  WINNER:  Pizzeria Bianco",

Not only is their wine selection to die for, but if you have never had the pleasure of tasting a fine Limoncello, than saddle up partner: because Cibo is your destination of choice! Their Limoncello and Chococello are like nothing on this continent. I would say that they give Naples a run for their money. Shit, they give your Italian Grandmother a run for her money!  When you go here, try the 4 cheese pizza. If you love cheese, this is for you. There is a kick there, that will have your mouth watering for more! And their crepes, please. No comparison anywhere in town.   I heart Cibo. This is my restaurant of choice in Arizona. When friends or family come to visit I bring them here. Hot date with my man? Cibo! My birthday? Cibo! My dog died? Cibo! .... you get the idea.  Romantic, fun, girls night out, boys night out, family night out, work night, school night, hot night, cool night. It's raining men night and so on. Cibo!",

Not only was the food great, but the service was amazing.  They put us in the back \"Carriage House\", with our own waiter/bartender.  The ambiance was perfect and it was in a central location for those of us who wanted to continue the night at a nearby bar.  -Date.

Sure, we needed more time to peruse the wine menu and decide what to order, but when I told the server to give me a couple more minutes to pick my wine of choice, she never again asked me if I wanted a glass. In fact, she hardly came to our table at all. Didn't even ask how dinner was, if I remember correctly. Pity.   I wanted so badly to like this place, and, in a way, I really did. I love the concept and the history of the bungalow. That gets an A+ from me. And the pizza we ordered was pretty amazing. I can't vouch for the wine. It seems like the menu is created for those who understand Italian or know alot about Italian food. Or, it's designed to be accompanied by an intelligent server who can walk you through the wine offerings and pizza choices. Even the specials sounded complicated. Maybe it's just me, but I don't want to feel less intelligent when I eat somewhere. A simple conversation about the restaurant and food would have been perfect, especially since neither Kym S or myself had ever been here before.   As we dined, the place filled up quickly. And then I discovered that while this is a great little place to eat, don't expect to hold a conversation with your friend or date - it gets LOUD inside! If the weather permits, I recommend sitting outside. I'll take my own advice on that one. As for cost, I thought it was pretty reasonable. $20 between 2 of us for a caprese salad (which had two types of tomatoes and mozzarella - yum), a white pizza with smoked prosciutto and zucchini (who would have thought this combo would be so divine?) and one glass of red wine.",

    "text": "Its easy to get into an Us vs Them, West Downtown vs East Downtown, Cibo vs Bianco pissing match, but truly these places are so unique and valuable in their own way as to coexist in a culturally void downtown in a soulless metro.    Cibo, however, does indeed take the lead by a very significant stretch over Bianco.    First and very much FOREMOST, the owners are absolute treasures.  They have never been anything less than engaging, charming, and overtly polite.  Whether my gf and I eat there or take out, they always greets us as friends and seem to be genuinely appreciative of our business.  On one visit when i was with a large party of about 10-12 people we kinda had to squeeze into a small area in the front room, which was still quaint and comfortable, but i made an offhand joke after the owner looked concerned about my smallish seat, that she could \"make it up to me with a beer\".  I was completely embarrassed as she REALLY DID bring me a Celebration Ale on the house.  She's just an awesome lady.  Their building itself is enamoring with a large patio for the pleasant autumn nights of Phoenix and their interior is very cozy for a more subtle dinner.  The restaurant can be both romantic or merry.    Their tiny bar is perfect for a short wait (never waited longer than 5-10 mins at most), especially during take out where we like to enjoy their Sangiovese Chianti blend.   Their pizza itself is delicious.  The Rustica is my go-to and they tend to use generous amounts of meat and cheese (the prosciutto being my favorite).  Their portions are perfect for two people and are well-informed on how many pizzas will be 'just enough' for your party.  Also, their marscapone/Nutella crepes are insanely good.  If you ever have a chance to host an event, see if they will let you use their carriage house in the back, where, come to find out after we used it for our own holiday party, had a \"recent tenant\".  Lucky dude to have Cibo as a neighbor.    The back carriage house has a wine bar and a private server as well as a small patio for outside drinking/smoking.  Cibo is a perfect little neighborhood pizzeria.",

They've got these awesome sandwiches in homemade bread, kind of like fancy hot pockets or empanadas, but a bit bigger with nice ingredients like homemade meatballs.  They also have a really cute bunch of waitresses...:P.  It was a bit loud, but more lively than disruptive...they also have espresso and a variety of sweet crepes with Nutela  for desert, which is really cool.  I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "I tried Cibo because of all the reviews on Yelp and because I don't want to wait in a long line for Pizzeria Bianco which I keep hearing about.  I am not a very patient person and 3 hours for a pizza is pushing it, even though I love pizza it is one of my favorite foods.  Back to Cibo it was a little hard to find at night because it is dimly lit.  Which is nice and romantic when you get inside, especially since it was my girlfriend and I.  It is a located in a re purposed bungalow house, which is great to help keep part of downtown's history.    We ordered the Anitpasto Speciale which was really good although the roasted red peppers were overly done and mushy.  We had trouble picking a pizza and the waiter was very helpful.  He told us that they were individual sized pizzas but since we split the Antipasto platter we could share one.  We ordered the Salsicca pizza which came with tomato sauce, sausage and mozzarella. It was a really good thin crust pizza.  The crust was crispy and had a little char it actually tasted like a fresh baked tortilla (like mom used to make).    We did have room for desert so we each ordered our own crepe, thinking they would be a single rolled crepe.  We should of shared one because they were as big as the pizza.  I ordered the Nutella and mascarpone crepe which was good.  My girlfriend ordered the Nutella and banana crepe which was delicious.  We definitely will be back again for another romantic dinner.  Oven fired pizzas, fresh and imported Italian ingredients and reasonably priced.  It can't be beat.",

    "text": "After a year of debating whether to make the drive downtown for this place, I am happy to say that I finally did. I'm sorry it wasn't sooner.  When you approach the entrance, you get a good feeling, unlike the rest of the overly bright, pretentious, ubiquitous strip-mall restaurants around the valley. No, this is a house, surrounded by other houses in a real neighborhood - so the setting is beautiful.  Now the food:  We started with the bruschetta. Outstanding. I think while we were eating it our eyes were rolling back in our head! I had a Lagunitas IPA, it's nice to see they have a good IPA to complement their Fatta in Casa cuisine.   We move along to the infamous pizza (though the pasta specials were tantalizing - but had to try the pizza since it's my first time here). We ordered the Diavola with ricotta cheese. This pizza took me back to Trastevere in Rome. Crust was tasty, browned with a slight char, but not too much. Sauce was fresh but not watery, and the cheese was delicious. And though we were both full after a couple of pieces, we could not stop eating it.  Of course we had to try the dessert ( Nutella desserts will always be a winner). We split the Nutella Crepe and each had a cappuccino - and no dirty looks from the waiter when ordering a cappuccino after dinner in America! Delicious, a great way to end the evening.  I will travel from Chandler to Cibo any night of the week because this is a place that does it right. I almost never give 5 stars on a first time visit, but this wasn't a \"lucky\" night. Everything was top quality with genuine care and love put into it and that was quite evident. Bravo!  Grazie mille per una bella notte! Ci vediamo presto!",

We ordered what the server recommended and the pizzas arrived within five minutes. The flavors were bland and the crust was soggy and wet-so much so that we did not finish our order and definitely did not take any leftovers home.  We were looking forward to advertised interesting flavor combinations and pizza that would keep is coming back.

This restaurant is a great option for date night or dinner with family.  You can't really go wrong.  I recommend the nutella strawberry crepe for dessert.

    "text": "I will preface this by saying that I went here a couple years ago for lunch and thought it was very good, which gave it an extra star over my True opinion of my dinner there last night.  The BF and I went here before seeing Louis CK for our anniversary. We were seated right away, so that was nice, but it was like 5:45 so that isn't too shocking. We sat outside, which was nice and had pretty christmas lights on all of the trees. The waiter comes by after about 5 minutes and asks us for drinks or apps and we ordered the burrata as an app. The menu said it was topped with a balsamic glaze, which sounded wonderful. We were also ready to order our pizza but the waiter disappeared immediately after taking our app order. So we wait. and wait. and wait. And I swear it felt like it was a half hour, but it was probably more like 10-15 minutes later (we were super hungry) the waiter came back to take our pizza order. We ordered the La Noce and he left. Well.... we waited some more. Finally got our burrata and it was a mess. Two giant globs of cheese with the lightest drizzle of balsamic dressing (not vinegar, because there is no way this weak stuff was straight up vinegar) surrounded by bread and prosciutto. It was large, so I'll give them that.... but too large in my opinion, because there isn't enough bread for the toppings. The burrata was good, creamy.... but it didn't taste like balsamic at all, which was the most appealing part of the app. The prosciutto was alright... it didn't have a ton of flavor, but it was fine. The bread had a burnt flavor... not my fave. Then we wait about 20 minutes.... waiter did not check on us.... Finally get the pizza. The pizza was good. That was the redeeming item of the night. It had arugula, walnut, ricotta, and mozz. It was a tasty combination.   Now, the whole time we were there, there was a table of about 6-8 extremely loud, drunk, possibly old sorority girls sitting near us. All we could hear is their conversation, so much so, that we knew one girl was named rochelle and one was Tina and one had been divorced for 4 years and they had a friend named Lori who was just sooo crazy among many other details that we should not have gathered from sitting in their proximity, which obviously puts a damper on the experience. The waiter was so occupied with them, that we felt forgotten about all night. He was not attentive, he did not ask how things were, and he disappeared for long periods of time to go do who knows what for this other table (they had a bunch of ridiculous requests like splitting the bill 6-8 ways when the menu says they don't do that... hmmm). We sat down at 5:45 and barely got out of there around 7 to make it to our show (we were walking). So the experience wasn't a good one, BUT I would be willing to try it again, as I did have a very nice lunch there a few years ago.",

Great place for a date or just hanging with friends. Cibo's use of architecture and food is one of the signs phoenix can move in the right direction in city life.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to Cibo last Friday for dinner for what I think is our third visit.  We had an excellent experience again, as we have the other times we've visited.  Given some of the reviews below, we tried to decided what it is about Cibo that we really like, and concluded that in this case, the whole is bigger than the sum of its parts.  In particular:  * Food - the pizza is very good.  We particularly like the \"Salciccia\" with the home made sausage; the sauce is on the sweet side with fresh tomatoes, the crust is thin.  We also had the bruschetta trio, also good, and of course the dessert - this time it was the crepe with nutella and strawberries  (and ice cream!) but we've also had the fresca (all fresh fruit).   They have a selection of reasonable wines by the glass as well.   Also?  Try the home made cioccolino (a thick alcoholic chocolate drink) for fun.  Love that you can get all that at one place.  * Service - contrary to others' experience, our service was great.  Our waitress was helpful and attentive without being invasive.  The place was quite busy and yet we never felt rushed.  * Ambiance - the home-like setting (I hesitate to call it 'homey', lest it bring up images of stale couches) makes it feel like you're at a fun dinner party in someone's home.  It's the combination of all of these things that really make Cibo a winner for us.",

I am a picky ex Nyer so I did not think the pizza was all that great. I could not put my finger on it. I just found it to be bland and flavorless.  The crust was doughy in some places and burnt in others.The sauce was thin. However,  I liked the fennell sausage topping. Also the calzones are huge! The crepes are a different dessert choice from your standard dessert menu served at most restaurants. They are not out of this word though. I have had better. Caprese salad, again ok but I have had better.  So in a nutshell try it. We had fun, the service was excellent, everyone was having fun. In our room most of the customers were regulars, so that is a good sign. I just did not think the food was that great. Ok for the price. Dinner was 45 bucks for dinner, apps, dessert, and coffee- not bad!Oh here is a tip- get there at 4:50pm no wait. At 6:30 there were a lot of people waiting to sit down. I would go again, especially for lunch, I heard the sandwiches are good! So until then. Sweet little place if you are not picky about great Italian food.",

The last time I went was for a friends birthday & although they take reservations, they will not seat you until the entire party has arrived. It was a Saturday night & they were jam packed. We did mention once we were seated that we had tickets for a comedy show & were on somewhat of a time crunch. They took note & were able to get our meal to us promptly. Most of us shared pizzas & they were excellent! Real mozzarella, tasty red sauce & fresh ingredients. One of the girls had the wood board mixture of meats, cheeses, veggies & fruits. It was such a huge plate that it could have fed the entire table of 9 as a nice appetizer. Drinks were good but as mentioned in a previous post, they should consider having another bar open on busy nights. We felt like we were crowding some of the folks who were eating at the bar while we tried to order drinks before we were seated. Overall great place!",

    "text": "Cibo is a good pizzeria that I have visited on several occasions. Their pizza crust is above average and their location in a renovated house with great patio is very enjoyable.  Now, the reason I won't give Cibo 4 or 5 stars has to do with service.  (a) The \"small\" antipasto is for 2 people. When you order the \"large\" antipasto for 4 people everything comes divisible by 3. 3 pieces of bresaola, 3 pieces of prosciutto, etc. This does not make mathematical sense. (b) You have to pace the servers. That means absolutely do not order your pizza until you are finished with appetizers. They just don't understand the issue with bringing out a pizza 60 seconds after giving you the anitpasto. (c) The person clearing off the table after antipasto will ask you to hold on to your silverware instead of bringing you a fresh fork and knife. I hate this and never understand why restaurants do it. What rubs salt into the wound is that if you order one dessert to split between 4 people they will then bring you 4 fresh sets of silverware. (d) On two occasions we split a bottle of prosecco to start. on both occasions the flutes had hard water stains and these are accentuated by the collection of bubbles from the liquid trying to breakdown the hard water calcium deposits. Just like removing acid from around a car battery but not what I need as a first impression at a restaurant.",

I've been wanting to eat here for a couple years and we made the trip from the east side all the way to downtown. Sat down and were immediately greeted and I ordered a beer. The server walked away and came back about 5 mins later and asked us if we were ready to order sans beer. As soon as he asked us if we were ready to order you could see that he realized he forgot the beer. No big deal. I work in a restaurant and am very patient as I understand that sometimes shit happens. We order a bottle of wine and a salad and 2 pizzas. He says he'll be back with the beer and the wine and we are totally patient at this point. After about 15 minutes we are still sitting there waiting for our drinks. I can see the bar from where I'm sitting and there is no beer or wine in the service well so it's not like he is too busy to grab it he just never rang any of it in. At this point we look at each other and on cue both stand up and walk out. Ive never done this before but everybody around us honestly looked at us like they wished that they had done the same so their experiences couldn't have been any better. I'm not gonna bash this place and say that it's horrible but I'm just relaying my experience and I won't be back. Personally I'll wait the 3 hours at Bianco where I've never had a bad experience..",

    "text": "If Cibo was located in a large urban city like NY or SF, it would be lucky to get 2 stars. However, in Phoenix, this place gets a 3.5 stars for it's ambience. The restaurant is a very nice cozy mix of a pizzeria, a ski lodge and a patio bar.  It has a very unique and fun feel. It's also located in downtown Phoenix.  It has a very Northern California house type of feel. The wine selection was excellent and it was served chilled. The service was excellent and they were very laid back.    However, the pizza was disappointing.  The crust was soggy and it could have been much crispier. It definitely did not taste baked and there was no substance to it. It felt you were just picking up slabs of cheese with sauce. The cheese was good but not great. It almost passed the authenitc test but it's still lacked the texture and flavor of authentic mozzarella. Normally, I wouldn't criticize cheese so intensely but this place is trying to compete with the likes of authentic \"Italy\" Italian pizza with the likes of pizzeria bianco yet it failed to measure up. Nonetheless, Pizzeria Bianco is incredibly hyped in my opinion too.  Still, I would recommend this place because it is fun and unique. And people should check it out. It's not a cookie cutter chain that Phoenix is known to have. Furthermore, you will get the same experience as Pizzeria Bianco without the hype and the 3 hour wait.",

    "text": "Pizza reviews on Yelp are usually not all that helpful to me. There are too many different styles, preferences and expectations for comparing different pizza places. That being said, if you're looking for the \"artisanal\" style of pizza (small, relatively thin crust, simple but flavorful toppings, fired in a very hot wood oven), Cibo is a winner.  I love trying different pizza places (usually limiting myself to artisanal or new york style), and, for me the trinity of pizza perfection in Phoenix is Cibo, Bianco, and La Grande Orange (and NYPD if I need a lot of pizza). Bianco is great, but has long lines; La Grande Orange is a bit heavy on the toppings, but Cibo seems to get things just right for me.  Their crusts are flavorful, chewy around the outside, with just a slight bit of charring. However, the crust could stand to have a bit more structure toward the middle of the pizza (the crust will go limp if there are too many toppings). The toppings are fresh, flavorful, and of obviously high quality. If you want a pizza that is comparable to the legendary Bianco pizzas, Cibo is an excellent choice.  For dessert, try the strawberry (or banana) nutella crepes. The ambiance is great both inside and out, although the inside can get a bit loud. Also note that they allow you to order their pizza for pick-up.",

First came our salads, which he insisted we get.  All I can say is yuk.  They just were weird and not that good for the price.  Then he disappeared.  Two non-english speaking girls brought our pizzas, but wouldn't take our six dirty salad plates and utensils.  What fun it is to eat your main course with dirty dishes all over the table.  Our waiter had GUARANTEED us that the pizzas would be the best we had ever eaten.  Meh.  I've had better at NYPD Pizza.    But what really ticked me off is that we could get no refills on beverages, no dirty dishes cleared, and nobody would get me a clean fork to eat my calzone.  For this price I think I'm entitled to a clean utensil.  Yes, the menu states that parties 6 or more will have gratuity automatically added.  I'm cool with that, except that at Cibo's that means \"after we take your order we don't have to offer you any more service, and we still get our 20%.\"  I'd never go back.

    "text": "Not real sure what all the fuss is about this place...It is a restaurant which used to be a old house which was built in 1913....there are more tables outside then inside and it is located right on the corner of fillmore and 5th ave......we went there today for lunch only because we happen to be downtown, we would never drive a long way to eat here, not sure why anyone would....We ordered the hot veggie sandwich which tasted pretty good and it comes with fruit or a side salad, we opted for the fruit but be careful and know the fruit comes with vanilla yogurt and granola on top, for those who have nickel allergy ask for no pineapple and no granola which are both very high in nickel...Then we also ordered the white pizza...the thin light crust was the highlight of the pizza, it was very boring and a bit salty....it was nothing to write home about and there are many many other places in town who have amazing white pizza, this just is not it, it totally misses the mark....the pizza is limited during lunch only offering 4 different ones.....we tried the fresca crepe for dessert who is enough for three people, you will need a knife to eat it as the crepe sticks to the plate and it is hard to cut without a knife...I wish there was lots more fruit, it was okay it needed some kind of chocolate or other sauce as the crepe was a bit dry,,,,,,the wait staff was real nice, helpful and able to substitute other foods for my allergies with no added charge....they have hot green tea leaves and the beverages are only $2.00 or less for unlimited refills which is a good price....parking is limited in the back of the building with only about 9 spots but there is metered street parking.......the atmosphere is quaint and the seats inside and out are hard seats with no cushions....if you like atmosphere go , but I was very disappointed in the foods especially after so many people on yelp raved about the pizza, I guess they do not know good pizza, or the cook was having a bad day........",

    "text": "Huh, so I'm clearly in the minority with this review. After hearing about this place repeatedly, I was excited to give it a try. End result was a \"meh\". For 6 of us, the total was $133. Holy crap! For pizza and iced tea?! Really? I tried the asian pear, goat cheese, etc etc pizza--which was odd. That's really the only word I can come up with...not bad, not delicious, just odd. Also tried a slice of the sausage/potato combo as well. Again, not bad, but not amazing.  Restaurant is oddly located as well, you're driving along...and then there it is, in a corner house. Most of us drove past it and had to circle around. Likely won't be going back, but don't think they'll miss me, since it was packed on a Wednesday night.  Large restaurant, but seems like a small space. People were constantly bumping into each other, some guy was almost sitting in my lap while he was waiting for a table (and I was eating), employees were weaving in and out of people and crashing into each other. They have pasta specials on Tuesday and Wednesday nights and other random specials on Thursdays (according to the menu).",

    "text": "It's hard to write a review for a restaurant that is loved by so many others as an Elite Yelper, and have to give it a \"Meh\" review. Cibo initially won me over with its great atmosphere, fantastic hosts and delicious appetizers, but it did not last. Be prepared for a lengthy review because I'd really like to describe my experience in full.  I wound up at Cibo with a decent-sized group (12 total, I believe), and everything started off great; the drinks began flowing and the appetizer was being passed around for all to share. The process for ordering was a little slow, but busy Friday night, large table...no biggie. I completely understood, and we kept ourselves busy with conversation. After a bit we got our entree orders in and everyone went with pizzas, and not 10 minutes later, they began to arrive.  Now, being the first visit for me, I decided to ask for recommendations. That's just what I like to do because I like to hear a server get really excited about one of their favorite dishes. For the white pizzas, our server suggested the Di Notte. I was instantly sold, so much so that I asked for a suggestion on the red pizzas. He then mentioned the Capricciosa, and after a brief chat between him, my girlfriend and myself (Important Note: about the artichokes on the pizza), I told him that we'd take it.  Going back to the arrival of the pizzas...they came out staggered, which made sense since there is only one pizza oven. We all began sharing as each pie came out, and life was good. First we got our Di Notte (a delicious mix of cheese and spicy salami) which was cooked perfectly and tasted great! A little later, after other pie orders began filling the table, came a vegetarian. The runners are slammed, and they just call out the names of the pizzas and wait for a hand to be raised. Not really hearing the name correctly, I asked if that was the pizza with the artichokes. The runner said yes, and I took the pizza (Note: I was the only one at the table that had artichokes on my pizza). This all brings me to the most awkward moment at a restaurant for me in a very long time.   We decided to wait on touching the vegetarian pizza because we thought the runner just delivered to the wrong table. It happens, and I was totally ready to hand that pie over unscathed. But when our server came back and I mentioned the potential mistake, he told me that was what I ordered and continued to repeat it over and over. This was an embarrassing situation mostly because I took HIS recommendation because it was my first visit, and we had never even mentioned the \"Vegetariana,\" and because during the conversation we were having the whole table fell silent (funny little extra - the musician just started his break as well...complete silence). He caused a scene even after I had told him it was alright and we'd just take the pizza because it was a mistake. I tried not to place any blame and talked to him with a \"this happens\" kind of demeanor, but he insisted that that's what we ordered...PLUS he said that he specifically remembered us ordering that because we weren't interested in artichokes. Guess what's on the Vegetariana, folks? Yep. Artichokes. A whole fourth of the pizza was covered in them (I love artichokes, by the way. This posed no problem.). Once that was pointed out, instead of any sort of apology, he decided to explain how the artichokes were only on one \"quadrant\" of the pizza. C'mon now...I can see a bullshitter, and that was just blatant. It's ridiculous to claim that we ordered a different pizza because of one particular ingredient only to order another with the SAME ingredient. I hope you, the reader, is understanding the uncomfortable situation that I was in because it was a weird one. I kind of couldn't wait to get out of there for the remainder of the dinner.  That all being said, the woman at the cash bar, Melissa, was great, and she really made an effort to make our table feel a little more comfortable after the whole incident. I hope the owner of Cibo can take note of that because it wasn't really her job, but she was sweet, personable and took it upon herself to feel embarrassed and responsible for our server.  My first trip to Cibo was a bust, and it's really hard to want to make a return visit, but in time I'm sure I will. I can't let one bad experience dictate how I completely feel about such a beloved local restaurant. Sorry for the length, but I hope this review can be of help to someone. The food and the atmosphere was good, but my experience with the service totally overshadowed them.",

The salads were huge and not overly expensive considering the size. Our server (who I think was the manager possibly) was very friendly and the service was relatively fast. They brought out a massive Nutella crepe for the bday girl and the entire table promptly consumed it. Overall, wonderful evening and will definitely go back.",

At first they were very accommodating, they let us see the room and discuss how we were going to set it up for our party and went over the menu's with us. It came as a big surprise to me when we showed up and had to wait over an hour and a half for our first course to come out! Everything just went downhill from there. We complained to our server multiple times (we had 1 server for a party of 40) that the room was extra hot and there was nothing done about it. I had about 10 guests having to get up to try and cool down outside, fanning themselves and sweating throughout the dinner. Then when half of our guests left I realized they never sent out dessert and we had to ask for it! I was then told we should have requested dessert to come out, what kind of restaurant waits 45 minutes to bring dessert after a meal is finished?  My BIGGEST disappointment was how the catering manager, Michelle, handled everything after I sent her an email. I understand that she is the owner's wife but I've had teenagers talk to me nicer than she did. She was brash and offensive. Not only did she not take blame for anything she blamed our party for all of the issues. You can count on the fact that I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone and will have negative things to say when asked; which is unfortunate because I work downtown and a lot of people always ask me for recommendations. I sure hope the lack of customer service turns people off from dining here, you are better off going to Cheesecake Factory!",

Cibo has all the right stuff but it lacks consistency. One of our visits will be nearly perfect with great customer service, good food and a decent wine selection. The next time we take friends for the first time, the service is lousy, the food is average and the wine doesn't make up for it.  I feel in general it's a cool spot to hang out but for the service and food quality it is overpriced. Some time ago we happened to be there on pasta night. Apparently the chef makes all of the pasta from scratch which is cool but because it is labor intensive, they rarely have it as a special. If you get the chance to enjoy their house-made lasagna...don't delay, it is worth every penny!   Check it out but be prepared to park and walk since parking is scarce and it can get pretty crowded especially on Friday & Saturday nights.",

Caprese Salad - 2.5 star Not a good experience, the mozzarella was not soft, can't taste the freshness at all...$10 for four big piece of white yet no flavored cheese,,such a mistake.the tomato tasted much better on the other hand...and hello, are you running out of olive oil? I can barely see a few drops on the bottom of the plate...  Salsicca con Patate - 3 star Pizza with mozzarella, sausage and roasted potatoes. It was surprisingly good for the first slice, the potatoes were soft, cheese was melting, and sausage was pretty tasty...but that's because I never had it before, starting my 2nd slice, I realized that no sauce pizza can mean tasteless, the flavor started losing...err, can I have some chili pepper?  Fresca (crepe) - 5 star!!!! This would be my only reason to go back if I did..thin crepes with fresh kiwi, strawberries, peach, vanilla ice cream and whip cream! Yum!!! It was heaven for any crepe lover! Must try!!   Service - 2 star The place seemed to be very busy yet I only see one real waitress that was running around to take orders, the rest were just servers who don't talk to you....we spent so much time to wait for her to come, to bring us a menu, or just deliver the check....  Wait - 4 star Compare to Bianco, the wait is short. We arrived around 7:30pm on a Saturday, the wait was only about 15min,,sweet! But the indoor seating was kinda squeezed in...  So it comes to a 3.58 average..I had a much higher expectation when read the previous reviews, meh, I hate to admit, but I definitely love Bianco and LGO a lot more..",

When we were seated, we enjoyed the warm sunshine and live music they were providing on s Sunday afternoon. I ordered the Porcellino sandwich: homemade  BBQ pork with fontina cheese. The service was awesome and kept our ice teas filled up at all times. A little history on this place: Set in a restored 1913 bungalow, Cibo (pronounced \"CHEE-boh\") has hardwood floors, exposed brick, a stained-glass panel and a fireplace to set the mood while revitalizing the downtown Phoenix area with beautiful salads, antipasto, artisanal pizzas and housemade fresh pasta.",

Well, call it whatever you want, because it was all that and more.   There isn't alot of room there, it's a renovated historic house, but they make every bit of space work for them. Sorry for the short review, but I'll be sure to update this next time I go!",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I went to Cibo tonight for dinner.  We got the bruschetta, the Vegetariana pizza, and then the Fresca (crepe filled with fruit, and topped with more fruit) for desert.    Since we shared everything, the proportions, except for the dessert, were perfect.  The dessert was a little large, but very delicious.  The fruit especially tasted fresh.  The pizza was good, though there were many spots the cheese didn't cover.  It was hardly a problem however, as the crust is extremely flavorful.  The vegetable toppings were cooked to perfection.  The bruschetta was good, though I'm not too sure about the beans.  It's a personal preference, but it was just too many beans.  The tomato was very good.  The inside and outside of the place is nice, though the neighborhood seems kind of sketchy.  The music inside the restaurant was...interesting.  Both of those can be dealt with though, as the food (and service!) is worth it.",

There is no need for those little papers that you use to tie up the napkins and silverware. It really is not only wasteful of the environment, but entirely unnecessary, and also cumbersome for people to have to open them. You can still be a beautiful fancy restaurant without using a piece of paper to tie up your napkins. I suggest that you do away with this pointless custom, because your food is great and the quality of your restaurant speaks for itself. Do your part for our environment and do away with the needless paper wastage.",

We met right as they were opening so we got a great table. I ordered the hot (Contadino) sandwich which was scrambled egg, spinach and ricotta cheese with a glass of prosecco - my entree came with some fresh fruit. This was my third visit to Cibo (in the last three years), my first visit I had the crepes and the second I had the caprese salad. Everything has always been fresh and delicious, I probably should go more often but it is downtown and I have a couple regular spots a little closer to where I live. I would definitely recommend this place for a bubbly and fun lunch date  I have not had dinner here yet.",

My girlfriend and I sat in the outside seating area that was nicely lit with lights strung about the trees. There were also heaters near the tables the keep us Arizona folk warm during these cool winter nights. The live musician played great background music that wasn't too loud or overpowering which made it easy to converse across the table without straining to hear. Our waitress was nice and didn't make us feel rushed. I would highly recommend both the bruschetta as an appetizer and the genova pizza to share. The genova pizza is topped with roasted potatoes which is actually REALLY good! Definitely planning to return to try out the crepes. Overall, highly recommend if you're looking for a casual and delicious night!",

Light and crispy. I also love their caprese salad. As for pizzas: I love trying new ones each time and taking them home. The crust is thin which I love! I highly recommend: the Funghi, Genova, n Tricolore. And make sure you ask for their balsamic glaze and drizzle this on top of your pizzas!! It is heaven!! And I always top it off w a pasta dish.

Caprese has a lot going on. Interesting creation where the ham and artichoke and olives are just thrown into the pizza willy nilly and therefore some pieces have a ton more of the toppings. I like the lottery of grabbing a piece, but it was weighted a little too abstractly and would like some of each on each piece. The white mushroom truffle pizza was fantastic. Hardcore truffle oil taste and the mushrooms were perfectly slimy. Bread is loose but still tasty. Not as much crunch as I'm used to on the base but crust had the goodness. The farro salad we began with was actually really good as well and surprisingly large - big enough to feed 3 as an appetizer. Had a lot of veggies going on and a grate opener. Cibo is dog friendly and quite large with a nice patio as well as tons of indoor tables. Perfect for an office event or romantic meal. Parking is Street mostly but safe enough area. One of the better pizza spots in town.",

    "text": "One of the best places in Phoenix for lunch, dinner or brunch!! I've eaten here a couple of times and forgot to write a review = bad Yelper..  But after hearing back from a friend that I suggested this place to, they loved it and have since been back here 3 times within the past couple of weeks!!   Food~ yes their pizza is DELISH however they offer many other dishes that I think you will find just as delightful or maybe even better!  For lunch, please consider ordering the PLT - toasted prosciutto, mixed greens, tomato and spicy roasted bell pepper aioli.  Ask them to add some cheesy mozzarella goodness if your a fan like me : -)  It is one of the best sammiches you'll find around the Metro.  For a lighter lunch but just as filling go for one of the awesome salads;  The Capri, or the Couscous salad or my fave the Mele ~ organic mixed greens topped with chopped chicken, walnuts, apples, blue cheese and an apple vinaigrette dressing = yum-fest!!   For dinner, start with a either their grilled veggies or the antipasto special; meat and cheeses!  Both are wonderful!  Have fun choosing a pizza!! They are all too good for me to mention one over the others.  Seriously!! Just save some room for one of the Nutella crepes!!  They a couple of different ones to choose from ~ they are a super way to wrap up a wonderful meal!!  Restaurant~  This place is loads of fun yet it is somewhat romantic too! Sit outside and enjoy their terace - patio when the weather permits. It's a wonderful setting and a great place to have fun convo with a date or with friends.  Their indoor seating is also wonderful.  There's not a bad seat in this place.  The service is excellent!! They are very attentive, they know their menu items and help even the pickiest eater find something they would like!!   I'm looking forward to going back to Cibo very soon!  I hope to see you there!",

I want to move in! We both started with a cocktail, I had the Bellini and we looked over the menu and both decided on the Fritatta Melfitana, an egg omelet filled with Schreiner's sausage, mozzarella cheese, Schreiner's bacon and topped with grated Pecorino Romano and chives.  Our dish came with roasted potatoes with chives, toasted bread, marmalades and a side fruit parfait. The price point is just a tad higher than most places BUT the quality, taste and presentation make it well worth the extra change.    I posted a pic, yeah...THAT GOOD!",

    "text": "I was visiting from California, and only came to Cibo because it seemed like the only edible place (that had good reviews) in Arizona. The exterior was surprising, it was basically a house that was converted to a restaurant. Once you walk in you immediately feel at home. I also loved how all the awards or that they have won were placed on the wall.   Now... on to the food. I ordered pizza, I got half Diavola and half Genova. The Diavola is Tomato sauce - mozzarella and spicy salame and the Genova was Mozzarella - basil pesto - onions - roasted potatoes and grated parmimgiano. Hands down the Diavola was probably the best pizza I have ever had in a restaurant. It is a must get! Now the Genova, was good but it could have been better. I've never had potato on my pizza before but I felt like they were a little undercooked. Besides that it was also really good and had good flavor.   If you are visiting AZ then definitely go here, you won't be disappointed. I just hope they expand to San Diego!",

Prepare to indulge and do not count count calories.  You're eating quality ingredients with remarkable flavors.  The Barrata is superb! Smooth creamy Barrata with aged sweet balsamic vinegar and thin cuts of prosciutto on toasted bread is a must! Pizzas, oh the pizzas...are made in a wood fired oven and offer the perfect toasted yet chewy crusts. I highly recommend the Diavola if you like spice.  You can always add a touch of coolness by adding ricotta cheese. Secondly I recommend their Salsiccia con Potate. Baked chunks of seasoned potatoes with sausage and mozzarella.   All desserts are wonderful, great coffees and homemade creamy lemoncello.    Notes: Sunday brunch is offered with a slightly different menu. They also serve chorizo that is remarkable! They serve a pizza much like the Salsiccia con potate with pesto & onions.  Sounds strange but it's delicious!   Homemade pastas served only 2 nights a week. Check their website. Currently it's Wed & Thurs.   Only beer & wine; except at brunch where they offer Bloody Mary's.   Bon Appetit!",

My dining companion and I sat inside in a cute little corner of the restaurant.  Our server, Tom, was great! Attentive but not hovering, funny, and accommodating.    I ordered a glass (or two) of the Pillsbury Wild Child, which is one of my faves!  We started with the grilled veggie plate (lots of tasty grilled/chilled veggies lightly drizzled with olive oil and a side of bread), then we ordered a mushroom pizza on the gluten-free crust.  We asked Tom if we could sub goat cheese for the cow stuff and he totally made it happen.  What a guy!  It was effing delicious, I couldn't even tell the crust was sans gluten.    The look of the place and adorable, very cozy and cute.  Good location and really nice for a date:) I'm sure most of you have already enjoyed Cibo, but if you haven't....well, get yourself together and head down!",

First time was to celebrate my b/day & it was with another couple. We ordered 2 pizzas & salads & shared. The salad was really goo-ood. The bar service was a little slow. Over all a good experience & we made it back. The second time we were seated in the bar area & the wait for everything this time was tremendous. We ordered the 3 Pairs of Bruschetta & it was phenominal btw.... I would eat that every single day. We also had the Tartufata pizza which was good but this time I was beyond irritated with the wait for everything. Long wait for drink order to be taken, longer wait for appetizer/pizza order to be taken, refills on water long, extra long wait for drink orders, etc etc There was seriously  a couple seated after us in the same seating area with a different wait staff that was served & left while we were still waiting for the check. Very disappointed in the service & deflated after a long day of work & spending 2 hours for an appetizer, pizza & 2 beers is not the way I went to spend my evening. This was not on a busy saturday night either. We returned to the lot behind the restaurant & some schmo parked behind us. The hubs had to go in & have the party located so we could leave. Apparently this is norm because there were other cars double parked. RIDICULOUSNESS! I won't write Cibo off today just because a staff had a bad night or because I didn't know that double parking was expected in the lot. I now know that I should park on the street not the lot but if the slow service is consistant with either the bar or wait staff then sad faces I will have to abandon that delicious Bruschetta which is the only reason I gave 3 stars.",

We went around 8 and the place was packed, staff was running in and out and each plate that walked by looked better than the last. It took about 15 minutes to be seated but the patio was perfect. I got a glass of red wine and my friend and I split the antipasto speciale appetizer. With many small morsels like prosciutto, Caramelized onions,  mozzarella, and olives it was a nice starter platter.       We ordered a half and half pizza with the La Noce and the Capriciossa. The Noce had arugula and walnuts while the Capriciossa was covered in artichoke, prosciutto, mushrooms and black olives. We took our pizza to go because it did take a bit to come out, but over all it was an enjoyable, relaxed setting.",

I can tell this is a place I would come to often with my husband if we lived here, but I'm from indiana. I ordered a root beer and margharita pizza. It was ready really fast. It came to the table very hot and topped with huge basil leaves. The cheese was sparse-the way it should be. The cheese and sauce were of excellent quality.  The crust left something to be desired so I didn't eat the edges. It tasted like toast. Not bad, just not ideal. My bill was $14.50. I would definitely go back.  A side note/caution: don't walk there by yourself. It is not a well lit area and there were a few times I thought I should not be alone. This however, should not reflect poorly on the establishment.",

    "text": "The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the following reasons.    When I called to make reservations 10 days before wishing to dine there, the man told me that they don't usually take reservations for parties of five, \"but that he'd see what he could do.\"  He had a vaguely condescending tone.  Then when I had the nerve to ask him if we could be on the patio, he kind of laughed and said, \"the patio fills up quickly but again, I'll see what I can do.\"  Seeing as though I made the reservation 10 days in advance, I'd think the patio wouldn't be booked up that far out....but maybe I'm mistaken.      When we got there the night we dined, it was a perfect night and the patio was beautiful with twinkly lights on all the trees.  When we gave our names for our 7:30 reservations, the owners,( I'm assuming they're the owners, they seemed to be a couple) seemed very stressed out and told us they would seat us as soon as possible.....and we waited....and we waited.  I was the designated driver so I ordered a club soda with lime, but this establishment only has $6 bottles of Italian sparkling water, which certainly added up throughout the evening.  We had cocktails as we stood on the ramp leading from the restaurant to the patio, being jostled about by waiters and patrons frequently.  My brother asked me if I knew what the word \"Cibo\" meant.  I said I did not.  Then he said with a sly grin, \"It means SLOW.\"  Finally, after waiting about 40 mins., we were seated.    We seemed to have 3 or 4 waiters.  It didn't really affect the experience too much except that we didn't know who to ask for what.  People kept coming up and asking us things we had already told the last waiter who'd visited us......strange.  The only other issue I have is the napkins are paper.  When you are eating pizza at a kinda fancy joint,  it is my belief you should have cloth napkins.  But again, maybe I'm being picky.    The food, however, was absolutely wonderful.  We ordered an antipasto plate which was great,  a salad with chick pea dressing, awesome croutons, Pecorino Romano and parsnips.  Out of this world!  Our second salad had pears, honey, more romano cheese, and roasted almonds tossed in balsamic vinaigrette.   My dad, the pasta freak, ordered a simple thick spaghetti-like pasta, fresh and not available every day.  It had browned butter and black pepper and herbs on it.  He was very happy.    The rest of us split 2 pizzas.  The simple Margherita, just sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil.  (They forgot to put the basil on the pizza however and had to bring us a cup full).  The other pizza was the Tartufata, a white pizza with prosciutto, mozzarella, mushrooms and drizzled with truffle oil.  We fought over the the last piece!      Seeing as it was my sister in law's birthday, they brought a crepe filled with chocolate which tasted like a big chocolate chip cookie.  I've never been that big of a fan of the crepe but everyone took a few bites.  There was also a jazz trio playing on the patio and even though they were a bit loud at times, we were not seated close to them and they did a version of a Radiohead song which I appreciated.    So, a bit of a pain in the ass logistically and service wise.  (They do have valet parking)  But the food is absolutely awesome.  If they would just get some club soda and those cloth napkins.....",

    "text": "i have mixed feelings about this place. there were good and bad things that i saw for example the wine and beer list was pretty extensive and so was the choices of salads and appetizers. now as a person that has traveled all over Italy the Italian cuisine is quite extensive meaning you have a lot to choose from anything from pasta to seafood and everything in between. but here the only 2 things that seemed to be on the menu were pizzas and sandwiches. which in itself wasn't to bad but i just felt that their could have maybe been more options available on the menu because not everyone goes to an Italian restaurant for pizza or subs especially since those are considered lunch items so you might be dissapointed  if you are going there for dinner. but hey overall it wasn't to bad of an experience.",

    "text": "Late night running around Phoenix wanted to get meal and found this place still buzzing late night.  We stopped in, it was a little cool, so we sat inside, and service was excellent.    We started with an Antipasto Speciale - a mixed dish with prosciutto crudo,bresaola with arugula and parmigiano, roasted red peppers with black olives and capers, Cipolle di Rosa, fresh mozzarella and grape tomatoes served with a fantasy of olives.  This was one of the best antipasto dishes, we fought over who got the last bite.  Next we ordered a pizza, my husband had done his homework and read the reviews, so we decided to try the Di Notte - fontina, pecorino, gorgonzola, mozzarella and spicy salame, thin crust, good texture, flavors were different, we ate it all.  And finally for desert we had to try the neutela crepes, we got two, a warm crepe filled with nutella and sprinkled with powdered sugar and chocolate sauce and the Nutella and Banana - a warm crepe filled with nutella and sliced banana, topped with powdered sugar and chocolate sauce.  These were a great end to a good meal.",

    "text": "I really wanted to give Cibo 5 stars from the minute we drove by and saw the place. The delicious smells, the live music, the twinkly little lights draped all around the yard...I just knew it was going to be wonderful.   We were quoted 20 min for a party of two for first available, but I read on yelp to expect that to be off -and it was...closer to 40 minutes- but it was a nice evening, and I was mentally exhausted from the long drive from Las Vegas, so I didn't mind that.   We are seated and I was excited we wound up with a nice patio seat. Our server brought us some menus and when we ordered water she sort of rolled her eyes at us. I don't know how the serving situation works here - one young lady was handing water, wrapping silverware, and apparently picking up all the slack of the actual waitress. She brought us water, and about 15 min later, seeing we still had menus, kind of shook her head to herself and got the actual waitress. We ordered and she disappeared again, but the girl with water checked on us and brought us a little carafe.   The people beside us had ordered dessert as we ordered our food, 1 dessert to share. The people from the kitchen ended up coming to ask what they had ordered. Our food showed up, and it was really good. We got a quattro formaggi and the pizza with speck, Asian pears and goat cheese. We finished and waited for the bill, and then waited to pay. Finally ready to leave, we realized we needed to break a $20 for the valet. I walked back inside, (where by the way wait staff runs past you each time you walk in the door and makes you feel tremendously in their way) and the host acted like I was really bothering him by asking such a menial question and said that he didn't have any change to give me and I should has asked my server, to which I almost replied \"I would, had I ever seen her for more than 2 seconds.\" (Like I said, almost told him that, I try to be friendly and polite though.)   I walked back out and saw my server, asked her to break a 20, she said the valet should have change, then threw her head back laughing? I don't know, it was very odd. The nicest person i encountered here was definitely the young lady (I'm 31, so the younger-than-me lady) handling water and silverware. I hope she is getting a cut of the tips, and had I been able to get change before walking out to the car, I definitely would have slipped her some of it.   Those poor people beside us might still be waiting for their Fresca, whipped cream on the side.   Ambiance: 5 stars Food: 4 stars Service: 2 stars",

    "text": "Very quaint and romantic pizzeria located in Downtown Phoenix. Has a very urban and rustic feel with the brick, vines, and tree lightings. Request to eat outside in the evening when it is much cooler as you enjoy the sunset and live music playing in the background.  We started off with the pesto salad, which was amazing. I'm a major carnivore and prefer having meat, but this salad was quite satiating even without.   For pizzas, we had the Procida (mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, Asian pears, chopped arugula, goat cheese and black pepper) and Salsiccia (tomato sauce, sausage and mozzarella). Pizzas crust were thick for \"thin\" crust pizza. I enjoyed the Procida most, since I love goat cheese, but would probably opt out of the pears next time. I usually prefer a very crunchy crust, but it's a bit soft here.   My verdict? My favorite pizzeria is still Grimaldi's in Peoria, but in terms of ambience, this is definitely a very cute place for a date or even an evening out with friends, so I would definitely come back.",

The atmosphere out on the patio was amazing and there was also live music!  It didn't feel like I was in downtown Phoenix.  We ordered the pear salad, Diavola (add ricotta and garlic), and the special pizza of the night.  The special was a white pizza with broccoli rabe and sausage.  All the food was delicious but I must say that the Diavola with ricotta and garlic was out of this world!    Now that I've FINALLY discovered this little gem, I will definitely be back!",

We normally get gluten free pizzas that have a thin cracker-like crust that is at best \"OK\" in my opinion.  I am a bread lover and I really appreciate a great brick oven fired pizza with a big crispy crust.  In my limited experience, all of the gluten free crusts don't even have this.  This is the exception everybody!!  This tasted just as good if not better than most pizzas that I have had.  We had a rendition of their vegetarian pizza with added olives and oh man, it was SO good.  The waitress told us that the gluten free flour was imported from Italy and the owner of Cibo (as I understood it) went the great lengths to ensure that the crust was just right before releasing it.    Again, I was a huge fan of this.  Finding good gluten free food can be tough for those who have an intolerance.  This is the absolute best gluten free pizza ever!!!  Well done Cibo!!",

I have never experienced an anchovy pizza, and i finally had a chance to try a piece at Cibo.  Surprisingly, it was quite good! If you like salty things, you'll love the anchovy pizza.  One downside for me is that they have so few pizzas that offer meat as a topping.  I think there's only one on the menu! Other than that, though, the quality of the food is excellent and they have some very good wines to choose from. I recommend the Candoni Pinot Noir:) /Art",

Best part of the visit was the atmosphere. Cheese and basil pizza came out to the table quick. I found lacking in flavor. No pepper, garlic, olive oil, or herbs in the sauce. Yet with the complete absence of seasoning, it was packed with salt. Also had the frittata which was had a nice texture and eggs were cooked perfectly. However, again, lacked seasoning.  I asked for ketchup and tabasco and mixed it together for a spicy ketchup that saved the dish. I was disappointed they didn't have a homemade ketchup or other homemade sauce for the eggs and potatoes. I would go back on a nice day because this is a charming corner garden in which to sit outside with an iced tea and sandwich.",

    "text": "Consistent above average quality. In my book, that's a 5 star.  Is it my favorite pizza? No. But not having my favorite pizza doesn't disqualify them from a 5 star rating from me.  I love the quaint atmosphere, and the fact that the owners are there working, and interacting with the guests. I ventured out of the norm and had their calzone (I added sausage) on Friday, and I loved it.  I actually prefer their lunch menu, and wish I could get one of their wonderful sandwiches with a nice light salad for dinner. If I have one complaint it's that I can't get their sandwiches from the dinner menu.  Cibo gets repeat business from me, and that says a lot.  ***ENTERTAINMENT VALUE**** It's often fun to sit outside (when it's not super hot) so that you can see people trying to head North on 5th Ave (a one-way South street at that part of town).  My last time at Cibo, I witnessed a woman with her boyfriend in the passenger seat heading West on Filmore and attempting to make a right onto 5th Ave (i.e. trying to go North). The driver behind the woman laid on his horn to get her attention. The woman was completely baffled, and her passenger contorted his body around so that he could look back that the driver behind his girlfriend and give him the finger. Heading North on Filmore, driving head-on into oncoming traffic, the woman got several more honks from cars going the right way on the one-way street. She finally took the hint, pulled into a driveway, and turned around. 5 minutes later, they took a seat with their friends, seated at the table next to mine, and sheepishly admitted to their friend that they were the ones who caused all the disturbance.  Calzone with Sausage: $15. Iced Tea: $2. Witnessing a guy defend his girlfriend's honor by flipping off some guy trying to help her only to later be almost killed by on-coming traffic: Priceless.  Cibo is the only restaurant I know that provides this type of live entertainment.  NOTE: If you are looking for a quiet spot to eat, Cibo is probably not it. If you are seated in certain parts of the house, it is often hard to hear what other people at your table are saying, and the reverberations make it possible to overhear other tables' conversations. I don't view this as something that takes away from the rating... just something the diner should be aware of about the ambiance.  Also, parking is a bit of an issue. If you don't like dealing with street parking, Cibo might not be for you. I don't like dealing with street parking, but I will for Cibo.",

They have this guy (Guido) come every Tuesday and he starts making hand made pasta early in the morning. He picks 2 unique dishes. It was one of the best pasta I have EVER tasted. I crave it all the time. I had a fettucini noodle in a alfredo creme sauce with herbs and pine nuts on top. I can't even describe the taste (wow what a good food critic i am). You just have to go check it out. I am going TONIGHT!",

    "text": "Spring is absolutely the PERFECT time of year to visit Cibo. I just can't imagine a better atmosphere than the set up they've got going on out on the lawn - picture intimate tables set up amidst the winding branches of mesquite trees dressed up in strings of white lights. Some may say cliche; I say it's down right charming!  Our party was seated pretty quickly (especially considering there were seven of us that showed up around 7:30 on a busy Friday night). Our waitress was awesome; answering our questions and giving us plenty of time to peruse the wine list and menu. Since pretty much everything looked tasty, we decided to order a variety and share. Most of us ended up splitting the Capricciosa, Salsicca, Pomodoro Fresco, and Salame pizzas, while one of our group opted for the Antipasto Speciale (because who can resist a dish that boasts a \"fantasy of olives\"). All were yummy, but the spicy salame had to be my favorite - they aren't kidding when they say \"spicy\". The Capricciosa was a close second, but, alas, had too many toppings to eat without a fork. The four pizzas, along with a generous quantity of vino, were plenty for six to share as a main dish, leaving just enough room for dessert. The Nutella crepe can't be beat, especially when embellished with a scoop of ice cream and the obligatory birthday candle (happy birthday Lisa!).",

    "text": "4/10 - Updating this to 5 stars.  Went here again and I just love, love, love this place.  We ate inside this time because it was cold out, and the inside is just as great as the patio!  And once again, such great starters, pizzas, and desserts!  This time tried the braesola pizza (fan-fricking-tastic) and the fresca crepe (filled w/ vanilla ice cream - YUM).  Will keep going here again and again while I'm in town!  *********************** Once again, another solid place in Phoenix!  I know this is going to sound really disloyal to my city, but I think that SF could learn a thing or two from good old Phoenix in terms of casual but upscale restaurants..... This is in addition to the lack of good patio options in SF - which of course is abundant in Phoenix , in addition to space heaters that are turned on if the temp is anything lower than 70 degrees (yes, Arizonans consider this to be chilly - sounds ridic. to us SFers).  Anyway, my co-workers and I had a great meal here the other night on the beautiful front patio.  The starters (pear and pecorino salad, antipasto platter) and pizzas were all yummy!  My favorite was the Rustica - yummy prosciutto with arugula, but I also really liked the Diavolo(sp?), with salami, sharp tomato sauce, and just the right amount of cheese.  And the dessert crepes were fab!  We got the Nutella + mascarpone, and the Nutella with  bananas - both very good.  All in all a great meal!  All served outside in the balmy Phoenix evening, on a quaint patio.... I was loving it!!  I want to come back again, and save time for some drinks before dinner - there are also cute little nooks on the other side of the patio, with couches / chairs and even a firepit!",

Next time I'll try to get a table in her section :-)  The food was pretty good. I had the Omero salad. Goat cheese and strawberries among other great ingredients/ It was really good.

The toppings are well thought out...they're not throwing a bunch of strange stuff on a pizza just because they can; the flavors really meld well. The crust is chewy but not difficult to eat. My pizza was a tad overdone on the bottom, but it was easily overlooked. They have a good wine selection but I was looking for a local brew since I just moved here and they didn't disappoint there, either. Service was a little slow but super friendly. The patio is absolutely lovely and the funny slumped over tree with twinkling lights is a nice touch.",

It was Sunday morning & a lot of places were closed for the day. We were so grateful for their Sunday hours!   Well, we just loved the place, but I'm partial to restaurants in old houses! The music and decor were delightful and relaxing. Menu options were very interesting and authentic and our brunch omelets were delicious! Our server was very pleasant. Only wished I lived in the neighborhood and could stop by regularly; Cibo's feels like the home of a good friend. And luckily, that friend is Italian, mellow and a great cook....",

    "text": "I heard high praises on their cheese pizza, so I had to come in and validate that claim.  It just so happen I attended a birthday celebration here, so perfect time!  We started off with some apps, meat-cheese platter deal--pretty good.  Entree--I had the Salsiccia Pizze, tomato sauce, sausage, and mozzarella.  I like to critique heavily on the crust which I thought was a nice, thin, but a little chewy with slight bubbly, char for the authentic, coal-brick oven touch.  The sauce was covered lightly but still had enough tomato flavor while the cheese was nice and soft.  The sausage was cooked nicely with porky, good flavors.    Situated near downtown, you are limited to parking on the side of the road, so no real parking lot.  The decor is artsy and charming creating a friendly, warm mood when dining inside or out.  Once inside you are greeted by a friendly staff.  There is a bar, but it's a bit small.  Depending on where you are seated, you may find it difficult to move around in terms of the air space.    So for a little Italian in the desert, it's not too shabby.",

I must say I'm more of a NY style, by the slice pizza kind of guy.  So the pizza did not hit the spot.  Maybe a little too fancy for my palette. (You can take a boy out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of the boy, so for me simple food is always better.)  Obviously, there are enough people who like gourmet pizza as this place has amazing reviews, so I'm just one simple man.  The obnoxious fat chick sitting right behind me proclaimed to her friend, \"I'm no longer investing time in men who aren't available!\"  Put down the pizza and grab a dry salad and shut up!!  That's not really the restaurants fault though but I did have to endure that convo through the duration of my meal.  Our server was very nice however seemed very rushed and at times we had to wait for refills on water and for the check.  The atmosphere is very romantic outside with light trees and live music.  They even turned on one of the heaters on the patio for the lil lady.  We has the Crepe with Nutella chocolate powdered sugar and ice cream and it was very very good.    Bottom line.  I'd be willing to come here again and try something other than pizza.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try this place, such great reviews.  As soon as we got there the excitement turned to disappointment.  My husband and I decided on a last minute date night when I get off work.  I had been looking at this on yelp and it was on my list.  We went last night, Sunday, and got there about 8 pm (they closed at 9 pm).  First we walked in, was not sure where to go since it was out first time.  Someone walked by and said the hostess will be back in a few minutes.  So we waited..and waited.  About 15 minutes later a hostess arrived.  We asked to be seated outside since it was beautiful out.  She was annoyed that the table she sat us at was directly against a bench which I kept hitting my elbow on.  We asked to move (there were a lot of tables) which annoyed her even more.  About 15 minutes later our server showed up (granted now the close in 30 minutes).  We asked for a cup of ice and lemons for our water multiple times...never saw those the whole meal.  She came to the table for our order and stated they only had 4 pizza's left so if we wanted pizza we needed to order immediately.  Since we had never been there, looking at the menu for 3-4 minutes was not enough time, but we wanted pizza.  We got a pepperoni like pizza and a sausage and potato white pizza.  We also ordered calamari as a appetizer.    When the food came out, all of it came at once.  This is my biggest pet peeve of restaurants!!  Appetizers come before a meal...not with it!  The calamari was nothing to talk about...frozen and bland.  The best thing about it was that we got the lemons with is, so we used those in our water.  The pizzas came out at the same time...again nothing great.  The crust was actually delicious, but there was hardly any cheese on them at all.  We asked for parm cheese, never got that either.  On the potato pizza the potatoes were still hard (under cooked) so we peeled them all off.  The pepperoni was okay, just needed more cheese.  The crust was the best part of the pizza.    The food was okay...the service was horrible (never got what we asked for, drinks empty whole meal, and rushed to get everything since it was close to closing).  I think with this experience we will not come back here.  We drove over 30 minutes to try this place and it was a disappointment.  I know there are a lot of good reviews, but this is my view, which is not great.",

Overall, I would come here again and I definitely recommend it for a date spot.. Especially when the weather is nice and you can take advantage of that glowing patio ambiance.  The only gripe would be that after a bottle of wine and splitting a pizza, we were asked twice if we wanted another pizza. Really? 2 pizzas in one night for 2 people? Granted they are not that big, but it's 4 pieces each.   I didn't comment on the absurdity of the suggested portions, but as we got the check the girl said something like, \"guess we're eating light tonight\". I really felt like saying- \"no, we're not stuffing our faces tonight and instead eating appropriate portions. Though obesity is an epidemic there is an easy preventative measure that can be taken.\" But, I decided against being bitchy.

    "text": "I didn't have a big appetite and wasn't really into stopping at a restaurant that my girlfriend wanted to go to cause she went there a few years ago. I'm glad we stopped. The place is located at the end of a neighborhood. It was so odd going through residential (or maybe those businesses that look like little houses) streets and arriving at the restaurant.   Cibo's a really cute place and it is probably super popular. The patio, at night, I can imagine is hopping and it is set up to accommodate a good amount of people (from what I remember, this was after driving 10 hours from Austin to Santa Fe and then another 8 from Santa Fe to Mesa).   We went in the dead of the afternoon, way past lunch, and the staff was hanging out in one room and we were by ourselves in the other room. Cute place. Repetitive but it is legitimately an intriguing atmosphere because it teeters between cute and cool. I had some thin margarita pizza and I remember being a little disappointed in that the pizza itself was a little on the soggy doughy side.   Girlfriend had... I don't remember what but she did order a huge chocolate crepe for dessert. That monster was super rich and sweet and I think at least 3 people can share it. If I wasn't staring at another 10 hour drive, I think it would have gone really well with a nice espresso.   I would definitely recommend people to check out Cibo.",

    "text": "So I got married downtown at the Icehouse last month - prior to that I have to say I had actually visited downtown Phoenix zero times.  I live in Scottsdale/PV so never thought there was a reason to go \"downtown\".  Boy was I wrong.     While vetting out a location for our rehearsal dinner we dined at a few cool spots downtown, one of which was Cibo. Coming from Chicago I consider myself a pizza snob/aficionado so it takes a little bit to impress me.  I was drooling over Cibo's menu before we even arrived, and they did not disappoint.  First of all, the restaurant and patio are just freaking adorable. I had no idea Phoenix offered neighborhoods such as the one Cibo is located in. Rows of cute bungalow homes just like back home! And located in one on the corner, there is Cibo!  What a romantic, special setting.    On my first visit, the server was knowledgeable about the menu, ingredients, as well as the vino.  I like that they use local and organic ingredients mixed with authentic Italian items that are imported and impossible to duplicate.  We started with the Ostia salad which I am now obsessed with and have tried unsuccessfully to duplicate at home.  The chickpea dressing was so well balanced, and the crispy parsnips on top were such a creative was to add crunch.  We ordered both a red and a white pizza, because we just couldnt decide. The pizza crust was just the right mix of crunch and chew, and the toppings and cheese were fresh and flavorful.  Ahhhhh and the Nutella Crepes. So simple yet so divine. Warm crepes stuffed with Nutella with a scoop of ice cream. Hard to find anything wrong with that.  So midway through my 3rd glass of vino the decision was made - we were going to host our wedding rehearsal dinner here.  We asked them to show us the location, which could not have been more perfect. Private parties can be hosted in what is basically a guest house converted into a party room. It was just too cute for words, needed little decoration, and has a bar, private bathroom, and a great patio. They told us they were planning to host small weddings in the space as well.  The service that I received with regard to our rehearsal was great. Michelle was quick to respond to my questions and I really appreciated her guidance on the menu as we had a few vegan/vegetarians in our party.   The value of hosting our dinner there was fantastic.  Our $20/pp package included house salads, a trio of bruschetta choices, a variety of pizzas, and those Nutella crepes I had been dreaming about.   To keep costs in check we decided to serve soft drinks and a selection of a couple of beers and wines for our guests to chose from . All in all, with gratuity and drinks included the bill was around $1000 for about 30 people, which I felt was a great value. The bartender and wait staff made sure everyones waters and drinks were full, and the timing of the service was great.   Our friends and family raved about the location and food, and had a blast enjoying the beautiful evening weather on the private patio.  Cibo will always hold great memories of a fantastic night with friends and family, and I look forward to my next visit to this little treasure. I have yet to go to Bianco despite all I have read, but honestly would have a hard time justifying waiting in line and dealing with all the hoopla involved with dining there when I know Cibo is around the corner and well deserving of my business.",

But it's worth the wait!  The food is consistently excellent and the service is pretty fast.  I absolutely love their pizza and their appetizers are also delicious.  If you plan on going in a group larger than 4, send someone early to put your name in to make sure you're not waiting too long!",

    "text": "Am I the only person in Phoenix who thinks Cibo is just ok? Probably.    We decided to book a reservation at Cibo to celebrate a birthday since we couldn't get a reservation at Pizzeria Bianco and my parents are not fond of a wait.  The restaurant is cute and welcoming.  The neighborhood it is in is just a little sketchy, with a lot of vagabonds roaming around and a halfway house nearby.  We were not shy in ordering several appetizers and a few pizzas plus dessert for our party of six.    Here's what we ordered and our impressions:  Appetizers:  Il Tagliere (an assortment of Italian Meats and Cheeses) - 4*, this is absolutely the best thing on the menu for a group  Bresaola - 3*, the table seemed to devour this one  Caprese Salad - 3*, standard deal, the pesto was a nice touch  Entrees: La Noce - 3*, the arugula did not seem that fresh, the crust was very plain and flavorless, the sauce was a little sweet  Prosciutto Crudo - 3*, my parents asked them to add some pecorino on top.  They liked this pizza, but it was a little bland to their liking  Siena - 3*, the table seemed to like this pizza the best, the spek was an interesting addition (though I don't eat pork) and DH liked it  Desserts: Fresca crepe - 5*, this was absolutely delicious and we ordered a second one for the table!  The service was okay, but we were left many times wanting drink refills.  Would I return to Cibo?  Honestly, No.  There are so many options out there for better food.  For \"higher-end\" pizza, this just doesn't impress.  I will stick with Bianco!",

Both meals I had were very good, the Apple salad was delicious! A 5-Star for me and served with some fresh baked bread (that the birds were demanding from me throughout the entire meal). The next day I tried the personal pizza; the crust was nice and crispy but to me the sauce seems a little too bland... maybe a 3-Star rating. I'm a big pizza fan so I'm quite picky with my pizza.  Overall it was a nice place; great patio space with lots of nature (aka - attack of the tiny birds LOL). Parking is the biggest problem here... I had to circle the block 3 times looking for a curbside spot and I still had to walk about 3 minutes to the place.",

I ordered the Diavola pizza and it was spicy, just as promised. My husband ordered one with sausage and he really enjoyed it. We ordered a bottle of wine and everything was just dandy.  Make sure you make reservations, it get pretty packed, especially this time of year. The only thing that I wish were a little different is their bar. It gets very crowded and it's tough to get through to order something if you're waiting to be seated and it's hard to wait in line because their space is small and people need to wal;k by. So, like I said, make reservations for the evening.",

    "text": "In my disappointing and down right horrible experience with my last favorite pizza place, I decided it was time to set out and explore new horizons. Yelp brought me to this place and I found a little peace of heaven.   I REALLY wish Yelp had 1/2 stars because this place REALLY deserves 4.5 rather than 4 stars, but not quite 5, and only by the slightest of margins. Here's why:   Jessica was our server. She was FANTASTIC! It's a rare server these days that can identify a customer's pace, adjust on the fly, and not make you feel rushed in any way on a busy weekend night - Valentines day no less. Expertly done, Jessica!   We were unable to get a reservation, so we put our name on the waitlist. They are very technologically forward and sent a text message when out table was ready. The allowed us to wait in areas other than the benches, the tiny house's foyer or the cramped bar. As we were waiting a musician began to play by the fire pit and we migrated there to listen. He was a wonderful choice, and it was quite an enjoyable wait time as much as wait times can be enjoyable.   Once we were seated at our lovely table and someone brought us water (she wasn't the friendliest), Jessica then arrived, introduced herself and explained the menu.   We started with the charcuterie board. It wasn't the best I'd ever had, but it was wonderful nonetheless and a good way to begin a lovely dinner.   As I mentioned, my intent on visiting Cibo was to replace a horrible experience with another pizza place that will not be named. Therefore, I originally had come for the pizza, but I wound up with the pasta. I was not disappointed! The pasta itself was fresh and made in house, the sauce was subtle and amazing. The hubby got the pizza so I was still able to taste the pizza. It was very good and we had no leftovers. Which meant we were either famished or gluttonous as the servings are quite generous. Either way, we enjoyed our meals immensely.   My 1/2 point deduction is really because of the bar and alcohol choices. To some this might sound nit picky, I agree, but it really bothered me. Their wine list and liquor list was surprisingly small and limited. I understand the difficulties in keeping a fully stocked bar and an extensive selection of wines - I'm not suggesting that. However, the selections they did have could have been chosen much better - better Italian wines, both red and white, and amoretto is a must. They do redeem themselves slightly with a HOMEMADE lemoncello.   The ambiance, the music, the food, the service, were all superb. Making a very minor adjustment and choosing better selections in the wine and liquor department will make an enormous difference.   Regardless, we will be back. If you haven't been, it's time to check them out!",

Each one is made so well, with such delicious and fresh ingredients, that it's hard to go wrong. I guess if you pick a pizza with ingredients you hate, it won't be good, but probably not any fault of Cibo.  Happy hour is really nice. Cheap house wine and Italian beer, plus a sample of food items. The gnocchi is fantastic - really wonderful and great to split with a couple people. In terms of appetizers, it's so hard to beat the caprese. The seasoning on the tomatoes is out of this world. It's my favorite caprese in Phoenix.  Again, if you aren't huge on Nutella, dessert might be a bit challenging. That being said, I love sharing a strawberry and Nutella crepe with my husband at the end of a meal at Cibo. It's so good... so good.  Can't really describe it any other way.",

Our friend took us here for early dinner, which happened to coincide with their happy hour offering, a buck for an arancini, polenta fries, gnocchi....all my faves...but other than the polenta fries, those dishes aren't much flavours....the house wines on the happy hour menu def good, either that, or we were just too dehydrated... :P  pizzas were good here, the thin dough was tasty...but maybe i am used to the Chicago's heavier flavouring on the thin crusts, i found their pizzas on the bland side..the sausages toppings are good though...  All in all, we still had a good fun time here.",

They did a great job of creating a warm, inviting atmosphere - it's almost like walking into a friend's home/back yard (depending upon where you sit). The warm glow of the lights throughout help to create a \"homey\" rustic feel - oh so charming! We tried the Antipasto (a shareable plate) the Calamari Al Limone (sooo delish with fresh garlic, parsley, sea salt and lemon) and the Tartufata pizza (because who doesn't love fungi, prosciutto and a little truffle oil - yum!). Everything was delish and service was great!",

When he spoke, he spoke with a luv and passion for the food. He spake as if he was eating the food in a dream and it was awesome. We ordered his recommendation di notte and the pacido pizza. WOW WOW WOW!  It truly was the best and authentic pizza that u can get. We would know, my wife and the other couple both lived in Germany for 3 yrs and we miss the food and culture. This truly was like we were back in Europe.   I read another review about threaten being warm to drink, not with us!  Ross changed our water bottle 6x and even brought us ice on request.   The deep fried rice appetizer is what u need to get as well. We also had to try crepe because they r the best. Again, Ross said they were big and we not be able to eat it all because they were so big. He was right. My wife and I could not finish it. But again, it was made to perfection. The presentation was just something to experience.   I can't wait to treat my wife to the best night out here again in the future.",

Also, the crust was interesting-- reminds me of s'mores (fluffy and slightly burnt). The pasta is also lacking. It tastes equivalent to making spaghetti and using Prego meatball jar sauce at home. Hmm... not sure what the hype is about...",

Our waiter barely looked at us when he occasionally visited the table, and requests for this or that seemed to fall upon deaf ears, more often than not. However, he did have an efficient and personable young woman helping out, who pitched in now and then to keep ball rolling, luckily for us.   The pizzas looked lovely, but the salads seemed rather more thrown together, than appealing. After the main course, about half of our used and stacked (hint, hint!) dishware hung out with us while we waited on a few desserts to arrive. Requested to-go boxes arrived haphazardly, in dribs and drabs, necessitating repeated requests. The dessert crepes were delicious, though, particularly the one with fresh fruit, cream, and ice cream.   Overall:  Venue: Charming Service: Crummy Food: OK to Good",

The happy hour menu is also really cute - the original is hand drawn and quite colorful.  I started with the Arancini appetizer ($4/4 arancini) - Arancini are rice balls stuffed with some mozzarella and then deep fried. When it got brought out I was surprised by how large they were, they were each about 2 inches in diameter! The mozzarella was nice and gooey on the inside and the marinara sauce completes it.  Gnocchi alla Sorrentina ($6) - the gnocchi could have been slightly fluffier but overall the flavor was good. The basil and the tomato sauce were nicely balanced. There was a decent amount of cheese which melted and made the dish an interesting mix of textures of flavors.  Linguine Puttanesca ($16) - You can order their hand made pasta starting from 5PM. It was highly recommended by the waitress so I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed! The pasta was perfectly al dente, it had just enough of a bite. The black olives are not your usual olives, they were the perfect complement to a mouthful of handmade pasta. The fresh ground black pepper and large grain salt also helps to elevate the flavor.",

We were seated promptly and our server brought menus and our drink orders quickly. No draft beer, but bottled craft beer is available Spouse & friend had wine. We shared the gnocchi w/san marzano based tomato sauce, a Caprese salad and two pizzas.  We also shared the polenta fries. Pizzas: 1 Salsiccia (sausage) and 1 Pomodoro Fresco (basil,grape tomato, and buffalo mozzarella. These are tin crust Neapolitan style. These are basically individual pizzas. Our friend's brother, who had lived in Naples and been based there, claimed they were the most authentic he had in the states. The ambiance and atmosphere were beyond reproach. That said, the portions are skimpy at best and are overpriced for what you are getting. Expect some sticker shock. This venue is most suitable for dates or two women having lunch, not a hearty appetite. Coming from Broohklyn, and loving Chicago deep dish  finds me more comfortable with more food and less pretension. Good place for yuppies and foodies who want a gastronomic happy hour.",

The service was attentive, the food was delish and I want to go back -- NOW! I'm not much of a meat eater so had the Quattro Formaggi Pizze -- but have to admit the other meat-laden pies were looking mighty good. Complimentary Nutella crepe on your birthday (money)! And I would highly recommend the Bellinis! Evviva! (Sorry, practicing my Italian!)",

    "text": "Came here with my boyfriend on valentines day after I read a review that said to skip the wait at Pizzeria Bianco (where we were originally going) and come here instead.  I am SO glad that we did!!! Our waiter James was absolutely amazing - very attentive, and knows a lot about the menu - you can tell he is very passionate about this restaurant and likes his job.  We ordered Bruschetta for our starter and it was absolutely amazing.  I don't even like tomatos and I couldn't get enough of their bruschetta board.  We then split a pizza as you can order half and half - I ordered their Trufeta (splg?) pizza - it has truffle oil - and is absolutely to die for!  We finished the night with a strawberry nutella crepe also very delicious.  We talked about this restaurant, the great service, the great food, and the great ambience for the rest of the night; and then took our friends there the following week.  Wish I lived closer I would go every day if I could.  Definitely skip the wait at Pizzeria Bianco and come here instead, the atmosphere is cozier, the wait staff is friendlier, and I think the pizza is way better!",

For dinner we shared the Prosciutto pizza and the Diavalo pizza and both were fantastic! It's is cute little rustic place with a beautiful patio. It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!",

I love the unique space being located inside a house (restored 1913 bungalow), with wood floors.... gives this place a warm inviting atmosphere. The owners are often there, friendly and staff is cool, helpful..... The outside patio area is beautiful on a nice night, white lights decorate the trees adding to the ambiance and coziness of the place. I always enjoy ordering the antipasto for two to share, a pizza or two, some wine and the amazing marscapone desert. Just wish they were open for dinner on Sunday.

Felt in the mood for some Cibo pizza on my home to SoPho from a downtown Phoenix client ... was guided by the awesome female bartender towards the Diavlo pizza with added ricotta (something different from my standby Margarita pizza ... she didn't steer me wrong).  As I tend to do ... stopped by on my way home with novel in hand, ordered a dry white and a pizza to go.  The serene hum of this sweet little place was broken up by a nice older, very clean, but obviously mentally challenged man.  He walked in and loudly asked what was on the menu ... wanted a loaded pizza and a beer in this upscale downtown restaurant.  The owner gave him his utmost attention and ordered him the pizza with his toppings of choice, and a beer. I'm sorry I didn't get the owner's name, but his attentiveness and kindness endeared me even more to this place.  This diverse downtown environment may scare some away ... but I just love the energy of people helping people.  Oh, and the pizza at this place is to die for!  Can't wait to try Pasta Tuesdays and Wednesdays, which I just learned about while I was waiting.",

The little house and patio transport you away from Phoenix and make you feel at home.   If you have never been here, then you're making a huge mistake!!!!! Be prepared to wait though.. Depending on what day or time you go there could be a wait but its well worth it! The wait staff is pretty good too.. Ohh and if you want to avoid the wait you can order to-go and grab and drink at the bar while you wait.",

My wife and I had our honeymoon in Italy this past summer and had pizza everywhere we went.  The pizza in Italy is a little different from what most Americans are used to, as they aren't as heavy on the red sauce, and they usually incorporate more exotic and fresh ingredients.  Now upon our journey to Italy we ended up in Naples (birthplace of Pizza), and couldn't believe how identical the pizza there (Naples) was to Cibo, delicious may I add!  So if you've never been to Italy and want something extremely similar in style and taste, then you'll love Cibo. The atmosphere is great, the place is a little cozy and expect to wait 45 minutes depending on when you decide to go.",

Basically, they ran out of some of their specials, didn't tell us in a timely manner, and then annoyed us further with some schtick about their chef not liking substitutions for an alternative entree we ordered.   In response to my review, the owner wrote me a personal message acknowledging what happened and offering a heart-felt apology. She also graciously offered to comp my meal, which I told her she didn't have to do. I have to say, with that kind of attitude by a business owner, no one can argue that she doesn't care about the place or its customers. And so, I can only conclude that I've been struck by lightning (\"random crap going on with a manager or servers on a busy night\" lightning) 3 consecutive times. So, I will shift my review back up to 3 stars for now (2.5 from my original review, plus a half star for sending me such a nice email), and reserve judgment for my next visit.   In the meantime, if you look at my original reviews of this place and filter out the annoyances that seemed to pop up, all of us the pluses still remain True.",

The experience is normally quite pleasant as well -- tonight, we were greeted very courteously by one of the owners and seated shortly thereafter.  Our service was rather lackluster and inattentive, but this fortunately doesn't seem to be a normal occurrence.

Inside the \"house\" is quaint, and intimate.  Perfect for a romantic date for two.  The outside patio is lit well with stringed bulbs, great landscaping and the occasional live music.  The pizza is on par with Bianco.  I recommend getting a pie per person so you can try a variety.  Also, I usually prefer red pizzas, but the whites here at Cibo always end up being my favorite.  The crepe deserts, with fresh fruit and ice cream are beyond words.  Save room, you must get it.  I love brining out of towners here to show what Phoenix really has to offer.  Not some chain restaurant in a strip mall.",

This place was one of the top places on yelp, and our friends swore by it, so it was a done deal that we were going. We got there just after 6, and were told the wait was going to be about 20 minutes. We waited patiently and finally got seated, though it probably took closer to 40 minutes.  We were seated outside, and the atmosphere was very romantic. There was a fire pit behind us, and trees all around.   We ordered several pizzas and a bottle of wine. The pizzas were all very unique and flavorful. My favorite one was the Margherita, which had full size leaves of fresh basil on it. The crust was perfectly thin, and pizza was nice and light. One of the other ones we had contained proscuitto on it, and was also very good. It really reminded me of the True Italian pizza that my husband and I had sampled in Milan and Rome on our honeymoon.  Overall a great experience, I would recommend.",

    "text": "Wow, was this restaurant was delish.  I am not a huge Italian food fan but I was VERY impressed with the quality of this restaurant.   I tried my son's homemade pasta and it was unbelievable.  I've never had homemade pasta but once I tried it I knew it was homemade.  I love that the portions weren't HUGE (which is one of the reasons why I don't like going to Italian restaurants--they put way too much food on the plate including something as filling as pasta).  It was just the right amount for an adult.  The pizza was delicious.  Again, even on the pizza, everything tasted super fresh and homemade.  The only thing that I didn't love was the marinated veggies.  It was a bit too tart.  I'm not knocking the restaurant because I figured that it was just my own issue with a dish that is a traditional starter.    The other thing that I didn't care for (which has nothing to do with the food at the restaurant) was the route that my family (hubby and two boys) took to get there.  We walked there from our hotel in downtown Phoenix.  Not sure that was a great idea, looking back.  Lots of homeless people wandering the streets and the main street that the restaurant sits on has some low-income housing that was a little scary looking.  Also, having that fraternity house right across the restaurant with these rowdy frat boys screaming things at the patrons as they walked into the restaurant wasn't ideal.  But the food was yummy.  I'd go back.  But I'd take a cab next time.  :)    Absolutely worth it to check it out.",

I've been there just under ten times, and for the majority of those, my service was friendly and attentive. The caprese was probably the best I'd had anywhere, with grape tomatoes rather than the usual romas, and just so much deliciousness. The pizza is good, as well. I wasn't hugely impressed by an omelette I had the first time I visited, nor the service that time, but I sometimes encounter that when I dine alone and the service has been good since. I was also impressed with some of their other salads. All-in-all, not much beats sharing a caprese and a pizza on a Friday night, listening to live music, enjoying the faerie lights and a good glass of wine under the stars.",

Or the mixed vegetables.  mmm.  Course 1 = success.  Then move on to the Caprese Salad - So fresh!   The smell itself is intoxicating.  Course 2 = winner.   Pizza time!   From the Pizza Bianche: Siena - mozzarella and zucchini, topped with spek and pecorino cheese.    ahhh!  the cheese, the crunch of the zucchini.  Spek (or hold this if you aren't a fan of spek, i like it both ways).    Course 3 =  Ding Ding!   From the Pizza Rosse: Diavola - tomato sauce, mozzarella and spicy salame.   You simply can't go wrong here.    Don't forget dessert!  Crepe -  I suggest the Fresca, but you really can't go wrong with any crepe on the menu.   Course 4 = Heavenly  They have a great wine selection.  I suggest the 1/2 bottle of Moscato d' Asti if you like wines of a sweeter, bubbly nature.    Be prepared to fall in love.  The food, the atmosphere, great service.... this is a great little house-turned-restaurant in Central Phoenix.  It was built in the early 1900s and they have done a wonderful job with the decor.  Sitting out on the patio under the sparkling white lights in the trees is a great way to add a little magic to your date night.  If you take your special someone out for dinner here, I promise that your lucky night will end just the way you hope...  Ladies and Gentlemen...you are welcome.  hehe ;-)",

Nice setting, especially nice outside.    Ordered 7 pizzas for a group of 8, but that had some children.  All were good to great.  I think the simple pizza margherita was the best, and a great value at only $10.  When I come back, I think I'll be tempted just to order 2 of these and a salad for my family of two adults and two children.    Just a nice setting, cool older building, busy hip crowd, and great pizza that comes super hot and fresh out of the oven.   Only reason I am giving this a 4 star is that our service was slow.  I didn't mind too much since it was so busy and I was with great people, but it took about 20 minutes from when I asked for the check to when I was able to sign and walk away, despite me putting the credit card down immediately.  The server just had other priorities.  In fact, they had the table cleared and were literally seating other people at the table before we had the check back.  So a bit of a slip up.    Still, they were very friendly, and it was a great meal.  I recommend this highly as a  date spot or even a family spot.  Loud and so very easy to just focus on your table.",

I have recently been to Cibo during a business trip in Phoenix, actually thanks to Madonna. Yes, that night a Madonna concert made all places busy in downtown, so, thanks to my colleague who yelped Cibo, we went there. The staff was very friendly, and our waitress was sweet.   My colleagues ordered some pasta that looked great, but those were somewhat small portions.   I ordered my favorite pizza: aragula, shaved parmesan, and prosciutto crudo. Maybe this is not a popular combination here in the US, but...did I mention I am Italian? I guess I did...  So, to be concise... my pizza was a 5 star Pizza. I thought I was in Rome or something! But no, no, I was in Phoenix Arizona, USA.   Are you still reading my review???? GO GO GO...Cibo is awesome!  OK since you are not that hungry, I want to talk about their patio. Actually, calling it patio reduces its awesomeness. It is a True Italian \"giardino,\" it reminded me of my summer vacations in Italy.  The only downside is that in their menu there is a typo on an Italian word... LOL...   I wish I lived in Phoenix...",

Cibo was a start for our fabulous evening downtown on my farewelll Phoenix tour (LOL!). We had dinner here before the Madonna concert and it was Fanfreakintastic!   The place was humming with regulars and plenty of Madonna fans. Weather was perfect for al fresco dining. We sat comfortably at a table in back with impeccable service by a new server named Kim. She rocked our meats and cheeses.   Literally. We ordered the appetizer of meat, cheeses, nuts and fruit. For $19 it was really a steal and fed us four Madonna fans well. The homemade mozzeralla was TDF...the proscuitto, bread, olives, goat cheese, grilled veggies...MOUTHGASM!  Of course we had to have a pizza and the Margherita pizza sang to us!!! Crust was perfection, pillowy and crunchy with the soft cheese, tangy sauce and fresh basil.   We were indeed doing the happy food dance. Which was a great excercise as we danced our tails off several hours later. So the food was much needed fuel.   Ambience was as charming as everyone has mentioned.   Cibo. First date. I will squeeze in another if you'll have me. Maybe I'll even kiss you good night and good bye!",

Always consistently delicious. We normally split a bottle of Scarpetta Pinot Grigio and then the Burrata appetizer (only gripe would be that the Burrata has TONS of tomatoes on the dish recently. We miss the old days with ALL burrata!). For the pizza we normally get the Diavola. SO good!   I am the type of person who tries lots of things on the menu first, but we found our favorites at Cibo and there's no turning back!",

The guest of honor was moving out of town and had had so many good experiences at Cibo they wanted their last meal in Phoenix to be at this spot that has been the source of so many good memories over the years.  What a disappointment. The server (male/floppy haired/'stoner' look/attitude, who's been there for years) ruined the night. 25 min after dinner was finished and NO contact. And none during the actual meal. Empty drink glasses, un-taken dessert/coffee orders, etc.  This guy needs to go.",

    "text": "Friday 6 PM. Table of 2. You will never run short on water as they give you a bottle on your table and promptly replace it when its out.  I got banana nutella crepes. Additional: Vanilla ice cream ($2) and whipped cream ($2). I wasn't told about the additional charges till the bill was presented. Surprised bunny. $7 for the crepe, $2 for ice cream, and $2 more for whipped cream. Total 11 USD before tax and tip.  Food came out kind of slow, but it was a busy friday night.  The pizza \"Latina\" was okay,... I had better. All the toppings fell right off, including the cheese. The crust was puffy and airy, and the center was extremely thin.  The server was tall handsome lanky and friendly.  The venue was loud alive, lots of ppl, had a lot of flies too, even indoors.  I liked how the windows opened to let outside air in.  It looks like a house was converted into a restaurant. The red bricks are charming. The lawn/garden /patio is welcoming. I liked the art on the walls.   There's only one walk-in bathroom for both genders.  Its a nice little oasis from the hustle and bustle of downtown.  Perhaps I'll return for the crepes in the future if I happen to be in that side of town.",

We had to wait for just a little while to get in.  We were attracted to the availability of a gluten-free pizza.    For starters, we had the pear salad on arugula, which was very good.  We went with a capricciosa pizza with prosciutto, mushrooms and artichokes.  It came out super hot and the crust was really good and crispy, even though gluten-free.   The service was very friendly and helpful.  I would definitely come back again.",

We ordered the bruschetta appetizer and the toppings were great, but the bread was burnt. We ordered two different pizzas, one red, and one white. The red was the vegetariano. It was quite salty and the crust was very burnt on one half of the pie. The white pizza's name escapes me, but it is the one with a truffle oil drizzle. This pizza was extremely salty! The crust was in better shape, but still on the well done side.  I like the location, the atmosphere is great, and the service was also good. Because of the salty pizza and consistently burnt bread, I'm not sure that I will return. Again, I hope it was just a kitchen error, but I dont think I will take that chance.",

The best pizza I've tried since being in AZ thus far. I got the basil pesto pie with roasted potatoes and mozzarella cheese, ate every last bite. Then I had the Nutella dessert.

Unfortunately the bolognese is \"finished\" with cheese, but that happens ahead of time so I couldn't get the pasta without cheese, so I ended up ordering a cheese-less pizza and substituting a spicy salami for the cheese at the waitresses recommendation.  I was charged extra (despite removing 3 kinds of cheese from the original order), and with the automatic gratuity (parties of 6+) I ended up spending $30 for a cheese-less pizza, a side house salad, and only drank water. The service was pretty bad.  Maybe because our waitress knew she was getting auto gratuity she just didn't give a crap but she always seemed annoyed whenever near us, and one of our orders came out 15 min after the rest of the table (but they comped it).   On a positive note, it has nice outdoor seating and there was a jazzy quartet playing, which I did enjoy.  I wish I would have known the pizza was going to be as large as it was.  I could have shared one and spent more money on some wine.",

    "text": "I've gone to Cibo 3 times now and each time, I said, maybe it's just an off night, let's see if it's better next time.... I prefer writing positive reviews, but I have to say, what is the big buzz about this place?  What am I missing?    The place is pretty busy for a Wednesday evening.  We had reservations for 2.  We sat at 7.  We were greeted within 5 minutes and placed drink orders.  Our waters came 5 minutes later.... our one beer and one glass of prosecco came at 7:18pm.  We decided to place our dinner entrees, so not to get caught behind huge parties.    So thankfully, I can pull teeth to make conversation, but dang the wait was long and I did not appreciate having to be dragged longer on an already not-so-great date. (haha, that's another story).  Our food arrived after 8:00pm.  It's one thing if it's extremely busy, but the server never came to check in on us or apologize for the hold up, or see if we wanted an appetizer 'til then.... ;-/  The Capricciosa pizze rosse and bolognese were all we ordered.  You would think after the long wait that I would devour into this and think it tastes amazing..... I guess I was disappointed.  The food wasn't as hot as I'd like it, but felt like it might have been sitting under a heat lamp for too long.  The center of the pizza's crust was soggy.  And yes, I appreciate and know the differences between napolean and sicilian style pizzas.  My pizza's toppings seemed sparse, too.    On a good note, the bolognese pasta was delicious.  Thin wide noodles cooked al dente paired with a good serving of meaty red sauce.  Love the chunky tomatoes.  Great herb seasoning and not too salty.  Very tasty, but again, semi-warm.    And to not completely knock the service, our server asked if we wanted their spicy oil - I asked what that was, she gave a good description, which I tried.... that was a nice dipping sauce for my cold crusted pizza.    By this point, I didn't want to stay around longer to dry the desserts... so hopefully, next time it'll be better!?",

We would have loved to sit outside but it was way too hot at 5pm on a Sunday evening in early August when we swung by. If we ever visit Arizona again, I'd much rather sit outside, it looks so beautiful!  The pizza we ordered was pretty good! To start we had a Caprese salad, but it came with giant slices of fresh mozzarella and was a bit too filling. We had a couple glasses of wine with dinner and it was a pleasant and intimate experience. The restaurant is generally quiet and we were seated in a corner. Between 2 people we couldn't finish the pizza. Maybe the Caprese in the beginning wasn't a good idea.  I saw someone else at another table order the Calzone and that thing looked absolutely monstrous.",

There are no fountain drinks which always seems to be the case in pretentious places along with the exclusion of saccharin from the sweetener options cause we know how awesome sugar is for you. Anyone lose a foot to sweet and low lately?  The meatballs are ok but far from having any stand out flavor. The bread is good though.  The calamari was ok but the pepper sauce was bland.  They only serve pasta after 5pm and you will hear people ask over and over as you dine only to hear the same origin story about how they make it fresh and its spun into gold by an artisanal god who does nothing but work on perfecting the pasta. This whole thing is just to push a feeling of demand, plain and simple. The menu is limited without the pasta so if you come before 5pm you are a sucker, if you come after 5pm you will have to wait. Just the right kind of mind tricks that get people thinking this is all they desire. I think its petty, petty as this review I suppose but its a crap ploy and stinks of smugness.  The pizza has the good bread but goes off the rails from there. The red sauce is watered down. Some people like the wine taste in pizza but this is clearly not the kind I like. They also do this authentic bs with the cheese where its is more of jizz clumps here and there and the meat thrown on with lackluster placement to show how not serious they take themselves.  The wait staff were great besides getting sat at the worst table but all these reviews are delusional. You could walk into a red devil any day and have a better pizza than this. This idea that authentic or age old ways of making something automatically means it's better is BS, sometimes new ways are better suited. To think this place has all these positive reviews for such a mediocre dining experience hindered by purposefully limited options speaks more about the people who frequent here just being happy with style over substance, bland over taste.",

    "text": "No bills barred when it comes to food. On any given night at one of the valley's upscale venues, witnesses have already caught me spending 300$ for a la carte dinner. So what's the biggie about going to Cibo to drop 20$ on lunch?   I ordered two hot vegetarian sandwiches ($9.50 ea) on saltimbocca bread and chose salad for sides. The topside of the bread was a beautiful golden brown, the bottomside was overdone. But I knew what to expect from the pictures on Yelp reviews. Still though, burnt bread is bread burnt.   What I didn't expect is the first bite. I went in with an open mind. Hmmm. What's that familiar taste? Bread. So I took another bite towards the middle of the sandwich. A little better, I got a faint flavor of grilled veggies. But the overpowering component - bread.  SMH. Cibo, ccibo, chibo. I know y'all are all 'bout it 'bout it when it comes to your wood oven baked saltimbocca bread, but can a customer get some filling up in here? Where's the filling?! Veggies sliced thin and not generously applied across either sandwich. Sauce spread so thin that I couldn't taste it. Spread so thin, I could barely see it - the inside of the bread was still white.   But hold on, I was sensing something. Feeling. I was feeling like you robbed me, Chibo. Come on! Forget ch'you! I'll make myself a real sandwich!  In order to even enjoy the amazing flavor of grilled veggies, I had to combine the two. But here's the sinker. When I was done combining them into one, you couldn't tell that I ever had two sandwiches. The one sammie now looked normal.  For taste, Cibo gets a 4. For presentation, I'll give 3. For value, the restaurant only gets a 2. Overall 3.5 outta 5 estrellas.  Will I visit again? Of course.  It's a beautifully kept place with easy foods and quick service.  Salads are great too.",

Good thickness with the crust and a good amount of mushrooms and Sausage.  The Capricciosa was tasty with the black olives and artichokes with the black olives on the strong side.  The service was excellent with our server (Kul) who made sure we were taken care of.  The parking is along the street with a small amount in the back.

    "text": "Cibo means \"food\" in Italian. It doesn't get any more obvious than that on what they offer here! We actually got dessert first nearby, and figured we should be adults and also get dinner. Cibo was recommend by my friend who we were with so we headed over to try out their Italian cuisine.   They offer valet parking at Cibo (Can't remember if it's complimentary or not), but there is also street parking available. We got here early (Maybe around 5:30-6) and were able to find a spot nearby. When we left around 7 though there was a lot of traffic and parking spots were a rare commodity.   The patio looks very picturesque, but there was someone smoking like a chimney outside and I'm sensitive to cigarette smoke so I decided on dining inside. We got a table with a view of the patio near the window.   Since we got here during happy hour (Discounted drinks and appetizers), we decided to split the happy hour arancini. It came in a basket of 4 with marinara sauce. The arancini were golf ball sized, and were fried to crispy perfection on the outside. The inside was very plain, just risotto rice, but the rice was nicely cooked. I was a little disappointed there wasn't any filling in it (The menu says there's mozzarella in the center but I didn't really see any), and for me the taste was a little bland and the texture monotonous. For the size of the rice balls I would have liked an additional hit of texture in the filling.   For our meal I had the cacio e pepe and had a slice of the vegetariana pizza. I've never had cacio e pepe so I was excited to try it out (Plus it gave me a chance to say \"cacio e pepe!\" in an exaggerated fake Italian accent at the table). When our dishes came out they looked amazing. I tried the pizza first. The vegetariana has various vegetables and each one is layered on a different part of the pizza which I thought was a unique touch. It was like you were eating a different pizza depending on which part of it you took a slice from. The vegetables were fresh and the pizza itself was decent. The type of pizza they make here leans more towards a Neapolitan style crust which is thin and can be hard to pick up. You might need a fork and knife to eat this pizza depending on your dexterity level. I personally don't really like \"floppy\" pizzas so it was just OK for me. (By the way this isn't to be confused with NY style pizza which has larger slices, is thin yet foldable and you are able to pick it up)  The cacio e pepe was well prepared, but for me I didn't really enjoy it. The pasta was perfectly al dente, and it had a good amount of fresh cracked pepper in it with butter and cheese. I can see what this dish tries to aim for, by contrasting the spicy black pepper with the delicate flavors of the butter and strong flavor of the cheese, but for me the dish fell flat. For me it tasted mainly like I was eating peppery plain pasta with a hint of cheese. It needed some more flavor for me. I did get a very generous portion of the pasta though which I ended up taking home.   Service was friendly and sweet. The other thing to note about my experience was that we were at a table that was slightly wobbly which made it a slight annoyance when we were eating.   It was overall a decent experience food-wise. The ambiance is nice but I'll go to a place for their food over how the restaurant looks. I might try them out again and get something different to see if another menu item strikes my fancy.",

We were never given a happy hour menu and had to look it up online to see if their even was one. We got an appetizer, which came out after our main course, and a pizza that was the perfect size to split between two people. Being Italian I was telling myself to just enjoy the food and not criticize it too hard because it might not be as authentic as I wanted. In the end the artichokes on the pizza tasted fishy like they were old and the food in general was a little bland. For someone that has never had authentic pizza or Arancini I could see how this place has such high reviews.",

I came about 1 hour before they closed on a Monday night after class and was waiting a good 25 minutes for a friend to meet me there. Our server Tom (I think that's his name?) checked up on me and made sure I had water and he didn't forget about me while I was waiting. He even moved a heat lamp closer to the table since we sat outside and it was chilly, so that was really nice.  We ordered the Vegetariana pizza, bruschetta, and crepe Suzette. My friend had a wine drink and I had the iced tea. The pizza is a pretty big, so I think it can be shared by 3 people or so. Because it was just the 2 of us, there were leftovers. It was flavorful but light, which is what I like. I'm not into heavy or salty foods, so that pizza was perfect! The bruschetta had pretty big portions too, which I think could easily feed 6 people (1 each) and we had leftovers for that, too. Bruschetta was garlicky and aromatic. The tomato one was kinda salty for me... so I ate more bread than tomatoes, but otherwise the one with beans really hit the spot. I always get crepe Suzette wherever it's offered. My friend wasn't impressed, but I thought it was quite lovely.  I'm glad I found fabulous little gem!!!",

My friend and I were in the mood for some dessert so we ordered a Nutella and banana crepe and a Nutella and strawberry crepe, both with whipped cream. They were tasty and not too heavy. The service was also great as the waitresses were very attentive. I'd definitely like to come back to try some of the other menu items.",

    "text": "Definitely one of the better pizza places in the city. However, we did try this right after having pizza at Bianco and would have to give the slight edge to the latter. The crust at Cibo was slightly thicker and chewier than its rival. Started off with the calamari, which was decent as well, but strange in that they were all uniformly shaped almost like nuggets (no tentacles or rings). I suppose that is a positive for those people who are weirded out about the shape of squid. We asked for a pizza form of the calzone and added arugula, which they were more than generous with. No complaints about the service either, as the server was quick and attentive.    However, I do have to say the atmosphere is better at Cibo when compared to Bianco. It's like eating in a living room of a rustic farmhouse. The outdoor patio area was really charming as well, although we couldn't really enjoy that as it was 100+ degrees outside.",

We all had wine and 3 out of four (excluding me) got seconds. Our friends got the Ostia salad for an appetizer and said it was delicious. We also got the Arancini which was good as well.   For dinner 3 of us had pizzas. Our friends got half Bianche and half  rosse. I'm not sure which ones they got but they loved them. I got the Vegetarina which was wonderful. My husband got the Pappardelle Bolognese and said it was delicious. The only thing I would say is everything came out really fast. We had 2 bites of the appetizers before the entrees came. My husband and I like when the food is spaced out.   We didn't get dessert. I had coffee and one of our friends had a beer. We will definitely be back. The waiter was also great. He really enjoyed his job and he described the food wonderfully. I can't recommend the food enough.",

    "text": "I'm really torn on how many stars to give Cibo so I'm sticking in the middle  Went there on a Tuesday night for the very first time and I absolutely fell in love with the ambiance outside.  The outside seating totally deserves 5 stars, but thats about the only 5 star I can give, if it weren't for the wonderful atmosphere I would've only given 2 stars.    After being seated we had to wait a while for our server to come over to the table.  Not sure if he was new or just having an off night but I was not impressed with him.  I was actually jealous of the tables around us and their interactions with wonderful servers.  We explained to the server it was our first time eating there and he just started pointing to stuff and spouting off about all sorts of different pizzas, meats, cheeses, wines, etc...It was a little overwhelming and he lost me.  When we were  ready to order we had to first flag him down and interrupt his conversation with another employee.  He took our order and quickly walked away without even asking if we wanted  anything to drink.  We originally planned on getting a bottle of wine but after my boyfriend had to walk inside the building the get some service and a drink we decided against the bottle.  Very disappointing!   I'm also somewhat glad we didn't order the bottle of wine because while we were still sitting there enjoying our dinner and conversation they started clearing off our entire section and staring at us as if we were keeping the restaurant open.  Keep in mind the place was still open for 30 more minutes.  I honestly felt rushed and that I couldn't enjoy myself.  If we didn't have to wait so long, flag down our server or go in the restaurant ourselves to order a drink we may have actually finished our meal a lot sooner.    We opted for the sausage pizza, which was good but not the best.  The mozzarella cheese was delicious and tasted very fresh, as was the crust.  But other than that I really wasn't all that impressed.    I didn't hate the place nor did I love it.  I'd probably give it one more chance and hope that I had better service the next time around.",

Cibo is in a converted 1940ish bungalow and has a yard full of beautiful trees woven with tiny lights. We got a table under a canopy of a few trees and shared four different pizzas that we chose by popular vote. I have to say that it was a hard decision since they all sounded pretty amazing. We agreed that the Diavolo was our favorite. And it didn't hurt that they had a nice wine list including Orvieto Classico which always reminds me of a favorite trip to Italy and a Salice Salintino that I always liked to share with a couple of my best friends back in my New York days. For dessert? Crepes of the Nutella and Suzette variety that we passed around.",

You can't go wrong here...their caprese, spek and pulled pork sandwiches are among my faves (served with a nice, lightly dressed house salad or fresh fruit, yogurt and crunchy granola - skip the chips because they're just store bought in a bag), and if you are lucky enough to go on a day when they have their meatball sandwich special, don't even hesitate - it's so delicious.  Also, consider having a private party at their adorable carriage house, it's separate from the main restaurant and used for parties of 10+. I went to lunch with 10 or so coworkers and we reserved it; the service was awesome and we had the place all to ourselves!   My only small gripe with Cibo is their refusal to split checks; I just think it's really annoying when restaurants refuse to recognize the reality of modern dining that more often than not, people in a group are not going to all be paying as one. They're nice enough when you ask them to split it evenly between credit cards, though, so as I said, it's only a minor complaint.",

We were greeted quickly and seated in the South patio area with windows facing the dead grass in the yard and a disgusting fountain almost black from neglect.  I guess I have the type of sense of humor that doesn't appeal to everyone because our waitress treated us with a dull and lifeless demeanor almost to the point of contempt for me trying to be funny.  Our food was really no more exciting or enjoyable.  I tried the sausage pizza and my date had the Margarita.  I must admit they came out incredibly fast..... Almost too fast.  The thin crust was slightly underdone and not as crunchy as it should have been.  My date thought the taste of her pizza was bland.  I guess there just isn't much to be excited about here.....

Pizza is great, fresh and authentic.  We had also a deli meat/cheese plate and holy crap was that good.  My friend and I could have got another one of those if our wives would have let us.  It reminded us both of our trip to Italy and the quality meats there.  The ambiance is awesome here, but small.  It is an old house but they also have outdoor seating which I bet would be nice on cool evening.    Seriously, this place is great.  Sad I didn't know about it sooner.  Oh, and the crepes...yum.",

    "text": "We went to Cibo for the first time with a group before the Lady Gaga concert.  It was my first time and I was very curious since I hadn't realized it until we went there that this had been suggested by another friend a few weeks earlier.  Cibo is just west of Central Ave and very close to ASU Downtown and the Light Rail.  Phoenix loves their \"Housetaurants\" Former houses turned restaurant. For this place, it works.  Walking up, the entire \"front yard\" is the patio seating.   Very cute setting lined with table umbrellas.  The lighting was enough to be comfortable in the setting and made it cozy.   It was charming.  If our friends had not been their before us, I would have suggested we sit outside.  It was super cute.   We get in and we were seated in the back, a little pocket in the back of a long room.  I guess it was becuase of the size of our group.   After looking over the menu, most of us decided to go with individual pizzas.  I got the Margarita pizza.  When i got it, it was delish!  It was pretty large for an individual so you might be taking some home.  We also got the Ostia Salad.  Wonderful flavors and the sharpness of the cheese shaved on it was a great start to the meal.  One thing that was slightly off was the service.  When we got there, it was pretty empty and we were one of 2 tables in that section.  Our waitress, while knowledgeable of the items, always seemed like she was in a rush and really didn't give us the time.  My friend asked her a question and then when she took a second to make her decision she said \"Ok, well I'm going to have to come back to you, and went on to taking the rest of our orders.  It was kind of the tone and the fact she seemed rushed.  She also didn't visit the table as much as she should in my oppinon, especially since we were stuck in the back corner.  Then at the end of the meal, we saw why.  18% auto gratuity.  It never fails big group, poor service.  It wasn't bad enough to not go back, and like I said she was knowledgeable of the menu, but her overall attitude seemed like we were an inconvenience to her. Maybe she was missing the concert because she had to work? :)   Oh well, no big deal, we would definitely go back!",

Sauce is mild but that's the way I happen to like it. Best way to enjoy this place is outside dining. Inside is loud, echoing and the background music is annoying to say the least. Ya, it's good but not worth a return trip and a long wait for an outside table.",

It's very cute and romantic especially with all the lights wrapped around the trees. The heaters keep you warm on a chilly night and it's much quieter than their indoor space. This place is a great date spot.   We both had the Prosciutto Cruda pizza and had wanted to try the burrata, but unfortunately they'd been out of it for the last week so we ordered the bruschetta instead. Our waiter also recommended the Valpolicella Ripasso, which was ok, but it was a little light for our tastes. The pizza was really good (the fresh ingredients really come through), but we weren't the biggest fans of the crust. I like something more substantial and airy. But  for a thin crust pizza it wasn't soggy at all. A big plus! The bruschetta was also ok (don't get me wrong I still ate all of it and would order it again), but each bite just needs a little more of a punch.   Service was great and we met Karen, the owner, before we left and she is a doll. We had a much better experience this time around and we will certainly be back.",

We grabbed a bottle of wine and sat by their fire pit to kill the time.

Our waiter made some excellent wine reccomendations. We started with the Burrata. This was amazing....so simple yet so delicious. Two giant scoops of this mild, creamy cheese drizzled with balsamic, served with toasted bread and proscutto. Creamy, crunchy, salty....so perfect. We ordered two pizzas and a calzone. The names of the pizzas escape me, but one had sausage and potato, the other red sauce and walnuts and the calzone was filles with meats. Everything was simply divine. I love food that is simple, made with quality stuff. That is exactly wht we got. The crust is thin, chewy and has the char spots expected with woodfired pizza. I can not wait to come back to try something else!",

Ricotta, tomato sauce, walnuts and we add proscuitto: it is to die for. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the last two times we've gone, our server was less than attentive.

    "text": "My bf went to CIBO after hearing about it from one of our Phoenix-Native friends. We LOVED it! I read the reviews about it before we went to I was super excited to go. We went for an early dinner arriving at 545pm and it was already pretty full. After sitting for a bit we noticed a bunch of ppl sitting outside waiting for a table. This place gets packed! We sat outside to the left beside the big tree with white lights- super nice! Underneath a heat lamp (my fav). The reviews are True, it was super yum! The only thing that was not the best was the service. Our waitress was a little out of it - she started off weird but after we order a bottle of wine and apps she warmed up. We started with a bottle of Scarpetta Pinot Grigio, Trentino Italy. The wine menu online is different. It was $30 and tasted good. We started with the Burrata - fresh mozzarella with a creamy heart topped with balsamic glaze served with black label prosciutto crucio and toasted bread ($14) I loveddddd the mozzarella - talk about quality mozzarella! I didn't eat the prosciutto b/c im a vegetarian but my bf said it was tasty! There are 2 balls of mozzarella and they are big! We got another order of bread - warmed not toasted which tasted even better than the toasted. The waitress was very eager to bring us more bread and she warmed up and was helpful at this point. We both wanted pizza and salad so we decided to share Omero Salad ($12 - organic mixed greens topped w/imported goat cheese, cucumbers, onions, caramelized walnuts and sliced strawberries, tossed with balsamic vinaigrette. We got the dressing on the side which was a good idea b/c it was strong! It was a really really good salad  - moderate size nothing huge but nothing small. For the pizza we got La Noce off the PIzze Rosse (they have half Rosse pizza, with tomato sauce, and half Pizze Biache without tomato sauce). SUPER yummy and a big size! It had tomato sauce, mozzarella and ricotta, topped with arugula and walnuts after pizza is cooked. I loved it! I wanted to order the Fresca Crepe since most of the tables around us had it and I read it was amazing but I literally could not take another bite! Which is off got me b/c i love food hehehe Def will come back and def try the Fresca dessert!!!",

The pictures make the place look more luxurious than what I saw in person (see pic 3 of 83). The second we started to enter 5th Ave (the street it's on), the entire surroundings was seedy.   When we were driving we saw a restaurant that we thought MIGHT have been Cibo, but it had gang signs written all on the front cement walls of the building and the side back walls were starting to peel.   We thought \"this couldn't be it\". Sure enough, it was. They may have excellent food and great service, but I was hoping some of the ratings or reviews might've hinted towards the unsettling feeling of the area. My girlfriend and I felt unsafe leaving our nicer car in the area to enjoy a meal.   My review: Photos and reviews say one thing, in person it feels a bit different. Locals of the area may love the spot, but I went to Scottsdale for the night instead.",

    "text": "Cibo is such a fun place to go for a delicious Italian dinner.  The setting is an old converted bungalow style house in a residential downtown Phoenix neighborhood.  There is complimentary valet parking (recommended).  The front of the restaurant is a large tree covered patio with twinkle lights glowing in the evening.  There is often live music outside on the weekends.  The wine selection is great and the servers are helpful in selecting the right wine to accompany your meal.  We always order the burrata as an appetizer followed by their amazing pizza, salad and the decadent Nutella crepes.  Our favorite pizza is the Diavola.  The meat is spicy and delicious.  Adding ricotta cheese to any of their pizzas is an option that just takes the pizza to a whole new level of yumminess!  Service is attentive and relaxed.  I highly recommend Cibo.  It would be a great place to take out of town visitors or to celebrate a special occasion.",

    "text": "Cibo's spek (smoked prosciutto, mozzarella and tomato) sandwich is one example of its deliciousness, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Like seemingly every other decent restaurant downtown, it too, is in a historic house.  This review is for lunch only - which means the menu is limited to sandwiches, salad and dessert.  It ain't cheap, so expect to throw down $30 for two for lunch.  Lunchtime draws in the crowd - your downtown business and government drones. Patio seating would have meant a 15 min. wait, but since we were in a hurry my downtown drone buddy and I opted for an inside table.  The feel inside is a warm urban rustic.  The food was very good.  The pizza/panini bread used for the sandwiches is the standout here.  Freshly baked, warm and near perfect texture. I could have had a bread sandwich by itself and been just as satisfied.  I spotted an attractive fruit yogurt granola dish at a table next to me - turns out it's one of their side salads.  I highly recommend it.  Service was ok, but would have been better had I gotten my water when I asked for it upon ordering and not at the end of the meal after reminding the server.  An honest mistake.  No big deal.  Parking is lacking here.  With the exception of a tiny lot in the back, it's the streets, yo.  We ended up with a two block walk.  Not a big deal, but worth mentioning.  I would go back often for lunch if it was close to work. My chance for one of their pizza dinners is looking mighty good.",

Such cute downtown Phoenix ambiance. Pizza's are enough for 2 or 1 hungry eater. As 3 hungry ladies, we split the Capricciosa and Margherita pizzas. They were light and yummy. Wine selection is pretty large. We shared a nutella and banana crepe desert which was also very light but so delicious. Cannot wait to visit again. Hopefully next time, we'll sit outside.",

Sausage, prosciutto and salmon are the house favorites and each pie comes with a generous drizzle of olive oil. The crust is chewy and fresh outta the oven, with delicious bubbles of char.   The atmosphere is reason enough to come here. This place packs the crowds in every night for dinner in its charming turn-of-the-century downtown home. The owners are sweethearts, the wine flows consistently and it's a vibrant downtown must-do. Skip it on First Fridays, though... the crowds can get too intense.",

I gave her an extra $2 in cash but felt that she really did not deserve anything.  She was short with us and did not smile once.  We had 2 adults and 3 kiddos in our party.  She made us feel unwelcome and very uncomfortable.  James, another server, on the other hand was very friendly and even gave us a tip on a great ice-cream place to try out.  I gave an extra $2 for him.  I WILL NEVER EAT HEAR AGAIN AND WILL TELL ALL MY FRIENDS TO NOT COME HERE.  You make ok pizza in a quaint old house and I like your venue.  Please retrain you staff to not ask customers why they tip the way they do.  It is called a voluntarily gratuity for a reasons and I do not feel like I have to justify my tips and be interrogated.

Mozzerella, the enormous white cat who casually prowls the property, making friends, taking naps, and maybe getting to nibble a calzone or two. He sat on my lap all through dinner, moving to my boyfriend's for dessert. For cats and pizza, I couldn't recommend a better place.",

I recommend the antipasto, for starters and for pizza, I am a fan of the capricciosa, the diavola, and the salsiccia. If you like white, the sienna and the di notte are both killer. The pasta specials are usually out of control good and the banana nutella crepe is probably my favorite desert in Phoenix (though the Pizzookie at Oreganos is a close second). For lunch the PLT (Proscuitto, Lettuce, and Tomato) is divine!  I would say that the staff is comprised of some of the kindest people I have ever met and I have never had a bad experience there!

A little disappointing, but the freshness of the ingredients sang to me and my little pizza was perfect with asian pear, arugula, and gorgonzola.

Loved the cozy bungalow setting of the restaurant.  We tried the T&K salad and the Salsiccia Con Patate (sausage and roasted potato) pizza.  Liked the ingredients of the salad made of spinach, oranges, cranberries, pumpkin seeds and goat cheese.  The dressing was not as flavorful as I expected.  Maybe it was the bowl it was served in.  Dressing was at the bottom and was not tossed well with the salad which made the spinach very bland.  Pizza and the dough was delicious.  My one criticism I have as with all other sausage pizzas from other establishments is how much they skimp on the sausage.  Definitely should be more when you are paying $14.5 for a pizza.  I would also slice the potatoes on the pizza instead of diced.  Will definitely return to try the other pizzas.",

I took a first date here (first time for both of us being here as well) and we both fell in love with it right off the bat. There was a little wait 15-30 on a Thursday at about 6:15pm and they don't take reservations for parties under 6 which is okay because everything made up for it. We sat on the patio and  got to watch the sun set on downtown and transition into the city lights. Clearly visible from our table was the chase tower, wells fargo, and many more. Our server was fantastic and on top of everything. Whats better than live music white lights in the trees and a view of downtown with a glass of wine. I will be back many a times A+++",

Now, I've had pizza in Italy and Cibo isn't as good as that, however, it is some of the best I've had since Italy and was reminiscent of what I've had there. We came here on Wednesday night and the patio was packed and since we were pretty hungry we decided to not wait and just sit inside. I gotta say, it's a very cute place. I loved the decor, it felt very quaint and homey. The service wasn't the greatest, as our waiter was rather short with us and not too friendly.  The dessert did take a long time to get to us, but really we weren't too bothered by these things as the overall experience was a positive one.  Now, down to the good stuff... the food. My Husband and I shared a margherita pizza and a spicy salami white pizza. The margherita was to die for and the spicy salami was great with a nice kick. My favorite part of their pizza is the crust. It's is so flavorful and has great chewy and crispy texture. My sister had the special gnocchi, which was really good too. At the end we all shared the nutella and marscapone crepe, which was utter bliss.   The prices were good, the food was awesome, the ambiance was delightful... we'll be back!",

The burrata appetizer is possibly the best thing I've ever tasted, the pizza is to-die-for, and the dessert crepes are scrumptious!  The owners are so kind, and you can tell the servers enjoy working there.   Great for a date night, dinner with friends, or late night dessert. A++!",

The outdoor seating is romantic and lovely, while indoors is equally cute and \"busy.\" The food is TO DIE FOR. If I was on death row, their food would constitute my last meal. Hands down, they have the best pizza I have ever had the pleasure to taste. Do not miss the opportunity to order the Burrata as an appetizer (and then again for dinner!) - the mozzarella is creamy, the prosciutto fresh, and the bread baked to perfection. We also had the prosciutto crudo pizza, which was every bit as delicious as the appetizer. Overall, one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had. A big 5/5 from this foodie here.",

I asked for balsamic vinegar, they bring it you in a little tiny plastic container instead of a bottle like the olive oil. Pizza was great, wine as well!! Staff is wonderful!! One more thing I realized that they serve the soda in the can!! Other than these few glitches, this place is a great hangout!!",

Basically a toasty focaccia bread with mozz and veggies in the middle.  Prob my favorite part of the meal. Pizza: Vegetariana (red pizza) - good, but really felt like they skimped on the veggies.  Next time i'll ask for extra or just order the Margherita. Genova - white pizza w/ mozz, pesto, potatoes, onions, and parmesan.  This was a different pizza than I've ever had before but it was very tasty and flavorful. Dessert (this is where Cibo really won me over): Nutella and Banana crepe - kind of hard to mess this up, but they executed perfectly: no skimping on the nutella or bananas and the crepe was the ideal texture, thin and moist but without falling apart Fresca crepe - packed with fresh fruit, ice cream, and whipped cream: yummy!!  Also, the beers were yummy, our server was friendly, and we got there at 5:30 so our large party got seated immediately.  Probs have to visit a couple more times and try the Margherita before I jump to 5 stars, but this place is pretty awesome.",

Parlor doesn't have a long wait and they have a lot more seating inside with lots of room. Both have great energy and the atmosphere is unique and very pleasant.  The service is Friendly and the owners are always there to meet and greet you,  very sweet couple. The food is amazing I love the salads and most of the pizzas. Cibo's has that intimate atmosphere when the weather is nice out. I like waiting outside by the fire pit  when its cold listening to the live band.  I also like the wine selection and drinking wine at Cibo's more than parlor probably because of atmosphere. Its a perfect place to take a date so you should check it out. They both are very delicious. JT",

This place is located in a residential neighborhood in the downtown area. You can miss it....as the patio is beautiful and generously lit up with twinkle lights. Plus, you'll likely hear the live music as well. The atmosphere is super lively and as I mentioned, the patio is THE place to be.  The inside was a little loud. While the patio had live jazzy type music indoors was loud Rock. Again, lively, just in a different way. The menu is Italian and a-ok. My family is Italian...as in from Italy, so we're a little picky. We ordered the burrata- the toast it was accompanied with was very good. We also shared the calamari, which for my taste was too thickly battered. I prefer a light batter.The dipping sauce was excellent though!  We also dined on the Arugula salad with pear, a meat and cheese pizza, the Tartufata pizza which is a white sauce with mushrooms and truffles. And for dessert, we ordered the Zeppole (donut balls) served with a nutella dipping sauce. Who doesn't LOVE a donut ball with nutella? Well....they would have been perfect if they didn't taste like fryer oil. Other than that...they would have been excellent.  The service was friendly and attentive. Overall a sweet place.",

    "text": "Cibo is probably my favorite restaurant in (close to?) downtown Phoenix. Everything I've tried on the menu is excellent, they offer such a generous happy hour, and service is professional. There are quite a few lauded Italian restaurants in the vicinity, but none come close to Cibo in my opinion.   The interior feels like a renovated cottage, complete with cute doorways and cozy tables. Space is a little cramped, but nothing compared to San Francisco restaurants, and I think the strategically-placed stained glass and doorways really help to increase the feeling of privacy between tables. It gets packed here very quickly during dinnertimes, but parking usually isn't too bad since there's plenty of street parking on the side streets.   Meatballs (happy hour menu): I've never found an Italian meatball dish that I've enjoyed until Cibo's version. There is such an amazing balance of meatiness and flavor so that the meatballs don't feel heavy. They're cooked to perfection, so no overcooked ground meat leaving that sort of dry, powdery taste after some chewing. The red sauce ladled on top is savory and complex, and it's a delight to fork off a little bit of the meatball, place it on top of the nicely toasted bread, and top it off with an additional spoonful of the red sauce. This dish is so good I ordered a second after we had polished off the first one, and I bet that it won't be the last time I do that.   Gnocchi (happy hour menu): When I took my first bite of this gnocchi dish, I don't think I knew how to react for a few seconds. I could taste the freshness of the potato, the softness of the gnocchi, the complexity in flavor of the tomato cream sauce that was made with fresh ingredients, and the creaminess of cheese. It was the first time that I'd understood why gnocchi is often described as \"little potato pillows,\" and all the components of this dish elevated it to something I would expect at a fancy Italian restaurant, not on a happy hour menu. I was not only impressed with the preparation of this dish, but also the fact that such care was taken to make a happy hour menu dish.   Fried dough spheres with nutella (happy hour menu): These mini-donut holes are freshly fried and dusted with sugar. Dunking them in the nutella yields a decadently-chocolatey churro bite. They are a bit heavy, but that's to be expected considering they are.. fried balls of dough.   Di Notte (white sauce): The spicy salame is pretty darn spicy in my opinion, but it complemented the creaminess of the white sauce and flavor of the cheese very well. I liked that the dough was chewy in the center and wood-fired crunchy towards the ends. The dough was definitely fresh, as I could detect the fragrance of fresh flour.   Da Vinci (red sauce): I personally prefer the red sauce pizzas, as they boast of a well-balanced red sauce that has both notes of saltiness and tanginess. This cuts the heaviness of the cheese on top nicely, and with a fresh sprinkling of basil, I felt like I could continue eating this pizza even after I was full.   Berry crepe with marscapone:  Warm, decadent, and well-balanced with the acidity of the berries and creaminess of the marscapone. The crepe itself is thin and elastic as opposed to cakey and airy, but I think it goes extremely well with the fresh berries and marscapone. This is hands down the perfect palate cleansing dessert after a flavorful meal, and I'd order it again and again.  I haven't had a chance to try the special pasta dishes offered each day of the week, but if they're anything like the rest of the menu, I'm sure they'll be delightful.",

The bruschetta was good but I didn't like the bean one. The bean didn't go very well with this type of food. The pizza and calzone were pretty normal to me. I've had a lot of wood-fired pizzas and they were just at a standard level.  I was impressed mostly with the prosciuttos!!! They were very soft and not too salty. They were perfect to my taste.

ALL the salads are amazing and are so unique. with different dressings and added fruits.   the margherita pizza has never disappointed me and their linquine cacio e pepe is amazing as well. ive tried their penne dish as well and its great.   im in love with the ambiance and outside is beautiful with the christmas lights and the live music on thursdays.   i love how the servers always know how to pronounce the menu items (theyre all in italian). great service great restaurant and i cant help but feel like their italian is reallly close to authentic compared to ur basic pastas you get at an american restaurant. love cibo!",

We arrived during happy hour and shared the 3 meatball & crusty bread ($3) the meatballs were huge & tender and the sauce was delicious.. the bread was dense and perfect to clean up all the sauce:.  We split a fungi pizza.. sauce, mushroom, mozzarella on top of this crunchy on the outside soft in the middle crust .. it definitely was on point.. great flavor.. I had the pappardelle bolognese with the yummy meat sauce .. pasta was aldente and just enough sauce.. my bf had the sausage sandwich with the truffle fries . He loved the sandwich..   We split the berry crepe.. it was pretty to look at but when we cut into it and the mascarpone & berry jam/sauce oozed out .. oh wow and that lemon zest added just a hint of flavor .. perfect flavor combo!  Definitely worth a trip into downtown to visit this place ..",

    "text": "I *love* Cibo. End of story.   Not really, but it's just that simple. Their gluten-free pizza is by far the best pizza I have ever had.  I've been so many times and yet, I'm always too enamored with the food to remember to take pictures. Most recently, my mom, grandma and I ate an early dinner prior to a show, around 2:30 on a Saturday.   It was not busy and we were able to get our order in quickly.  I always start with the pesto salad, it's so fresh. It's big though, enough for 3-4 people to easily share.   We also ordered the Marinara and Procida pizzas to share.   The Procida was amazing, my new favorite (bumping the La Noca to second place). The Procida is mozzarella, prosciutto, pear, arugula and goat cheese. To. Die. For.  The Marinara wasn't my favorite but only because it wasn't one I would normally order. I don't like capers or anchovies, they both are too salty for me. The other two at my table loved it though!  The price is great too, considering the quality, taste, and atmosphere.   If you haven't been to Cibo, you're missing out on one of the great pizza places in Phoenix.",

So, total evidence that the service is above and beyond.  But, besides that.....the food is just so, so good.  The GF pizza is probably the best we've had and we've had A LOT.  It tastes as close to \"normal\" pizza as we've ever had.  So thankful to have a restaurant that makes it enjoyable for everyone in our family in spite of the food allergies.

It's large and comfortable, plus not near a busy street so it feels private.   We tried one pizza (split into two types), pear salad, and a bolognese pasta. Everything was delicious. We spent a long time reviewing the menu since there were so many options and combinations. Eventually, we did ask for recommendations.   First pick for pizza was the mushrooms and the second was one with sliced Italian bacon. The pear salad added some additional sweet flavor so we ended up not even choosing a dessert to try.   This place is great for small groups or even an intimate evening for two. We didn't have a wait, but I would recommend a person to go early to get better seating. We were not right in front of the musicians, but close enough to hear each other speak and enjoy the music.",

It was an absolutely beautiful experience and I will DEFINITELY be coming here again.  I took my two small children (2 and 4) and while there wasn't anything about the restaurant that was overtly bad for kids, a lot of people go to have a nice talk over dinner and relax, and, well, my kids (like most their age) are beyond boisterous so I probably won't take them again just to spare the other guests.   The two things that made me a little uncomfortable were the mosquitoes outside and the lack of lighting outside. I went when the sun was setting and it was a bit hard to read the menu, but I asked our server to turn some lights on and when she did all was well :)   Added to my favorite local phoenix dining destinations!!",

Situated in a home converted to a restaurant, it is charming and romantic and a perfect place to take advantage of outdoor seating during Arizona's lovely cooler autumn nights. We sat outdoors during our first visit because we couldn't resist the big beautiful trees covered in twinkling lights. Aside from the ambiance, the service was knowledgeable, prompt, and friendly. I had the house pasta of the day (made with guanciale - pig cheek - don't be afraid! It's amazing!) and he had the Diavalo pizza. We didn't have any apps because we were trying to make a movie time, but we'll definitely be back to try more. The dishes we did have were outstanding. Fresh, well seasoned, and delicious! I can't wait to go back! Take your first date or the love of your life here, because it is sure to impress and add a little spark to the evening.",

We were excited to try the Home-Made Pasta - the Pappardelle Bolognese.  We were informed that the Pasta wasn't served until 5:00 PM - the chef just got there and was making it for the night.  So we decided to try a little of everything while we waited for 5 - lucky for us their Happy Hour Menu has some great items.  First Course - We started with the following:  Polpette (Meatballs) Arancini (Fried Rice Balls) Margarita Pizza - Charred Crust and fresh Ingredients (will definitely try some of the other pizza's next time) White Wine  Wow!  - Happy Hour portions were great and we even ordered more Polpette's because the first batch were devoured!  Second Course - we k now we were getting the Home-Made Pasta at 5:00, but we still had 25 minutes to wait - so we ordered round 2:  Gnocchetti Sorrentina - mini gnocchi with melted cheese - Yum Ostia Salad - This was the only item we ordered which was just OK.  The ingredients were fresh and great quality - the dressing just lacked flavor.  We all thought it was very bland - considering it was described to us as similar to a Caesar Salad.  3rd Course - Pappardelle Bolognese  -This was defiantly worth the wait!  One of the best Pasta dishes I have ever had.  The Bolognese was rich with a great texture from the underlying vegetables.  The Home-made Pappardelle noodles had a perfect consistency from top to bottom and melted in your mouth!  Dessert Course - We ordered the Banana Nutella Crepe with Fresh Whipped Cream and the Palline 2.0 (Mini Doughboys, Spingi, etc...) with a side a Nutella!  Both desserts were exceptional and they topped it with a birthday crepe for my daughter!  Great finishing Touch!  We live in North Scottsdale and will make an effort to come downtown here much more often!    Thank you for a Great Dinner!",

    "text": "We came to Cibo for a late dinner after watching a World Baseball Classic at Chase Field a few weeks ago. Cibo is one of the few restaurants in Phoenix that is open until later, and we came in to try their thin crust pizza. It is in a bit of a strange location, and is the only restaurant/store in that area. At first, we thought we entered the address incorrectly in the GPS, since Cibo doesn't have a lot of lighting in the front of the restaurant. It was close to 10:45pm on a Friday night, and the restaurant still had a good amount of tables, but we seated right away. We ordered:  -Funghi (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Mushrooms, $11.50, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cibo-phoenix?select=4Tnb6awzTKGHJfdSdC1iJg#cYFU7ejhfB6tKUHWXCWvkw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cibo...</a>): Just ok for me. I thought the tomato sauce was a bit too tangy. However, this pizza is good for those who enjoy a classic and simple pizza. I wouldn't order this again though. -La Dolce Vita (Burrata and Speck [Smoked Prosciutto] Topped w/Arugula and Balsamic Glaze, $16.50, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cibo-phoenix?select=4Tnb6awzTKGHJfdSdC1iJg#4Tnb6awzTKGHJfdSdC1iJg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cibo...</a>): Delicious! This was one of their specials that night. I've never had a pizza with burrata on it before, and I was glad we gave this a try. The burrata went really well with the speck, arugula, and balsamic glaze, but I think swapping the speck for guanciale would also be really tasty.  Their pizzas are split into red sauce and white sauce sections, and they have a good amount of variety for each type of sauce. We wanted to order more (the salads looked really good), but we had already snacked during the baseball game so weren't super hungry. I really appreciated that Cibo was still welcoming customers even though it was close to closing time- there's nothing worse than rushing to get to a restaurant before closing and the staff death staring you through the meal. Even though it was past closing when we left, there were still a good amount of customers still at the restaurant having a great time. The only slight complaint I have is that our server (I can't remember his name.. maybe Tom?) was really weird. He tried to crack a few really lame jokes, and become overly chummy with us. It was just a strange experience interacting with him, and none of us felt comfortable. I saw him drinking a glass of wine later on, so he probably got started a little too early. In any case, if you're looking for a good meal while out in Phoenix, and/or love thin crust pizza, make sure to check out Cibo!",

We started with the meatball appetizer, let me just say I would have licked the sauce from the bowl if it wasn't publicly frowned upon, and the meatballs were delicious. We also had the arancini balls-basically gooey balls of cheese and rice. They are very good as well but very filling-obviously. My husband then had the prosciutto pizza and I had the diavola, wish I would have taken pics as I usually do but I was too busy stuffing my face. Then we finished off with a crepe Suzette...filled with orange marmalade and topped with gran marnier and set on fire with ice cream. Needless to say we were so full we had to roll ourselves out the door. I could go on and on, but basically the restaurant is beautiful, the patio is amazing, will definitely need to sit out there when it cools off and the food is to die for.",

The food is next, and holy mackerel was it good. We got polenta fries and salads to start with. The salads had delicious and fresh ingredients, as well as gorgeous displays. I got the pesto salad, and would highly recommend it. For entrees, my parents got a white pizza, and I split the pulled pork sandwich. Both were delectable, and we all had food left over to bring home.  The kicker is that they comped our desserts (about $15 worth). They said it was because they made us wait too long in between appetizers and entrees. It was a bit of a wait, but nothing crazy! The desserts were so good, too. The 'fresca' is a crepe with ice cream in the  middle, topped with fruit and whipped cream.  Next time we're in the area, we are definitely coming back.",

    "text": "I've been here three times. I would say this place has the best atmosphere for early Friday evening. The best seats are outside during the springtime and if you could get the inside, it would also give the great view of the Phoenix downtown. The pizza here is made hand tossed and thin crust. Some of you may know that there is competitor near this pizza restaurant. Honestly I would choose this place over Pizzeria B.... because of the wait time there.   In addition to Pizza, this restaurant offers variety of wine selections and locally brewed beer. If you were not driving, I would highly recommend some of the wine; it matches well with pizza! Also, the crepe here is amazing mainly because of the fresh cheese that they use to make it. IF you are fan of live music, they play sweet guitar/key board smooth jazz on Friday night at outside patio. Check this place out and let me know if you visit!",

    "text": "TIP: this places takes no reservations on fridays and limited reservations on saturdays so expect long wait times standing in front of the house.  when you get in, skip the mediocre salads and just order the amazingly fresh pizzas.  ask to sit inside cuz outside can get crazy hot even at nights.  This joint is just unusual because it's in a house that serves pizzas and salads (i'm surprised neighbors don't complain).  expect long waits in the weekends.  Service could be better cuz the dude thought i ordered a nut brown when i asked for a dirty blonde and a calzone when i asked for a magherita pizza.  The pizza is as fresh as it gets.  You can tell the ingredients are fresh because the tomato sauce in the pizza is extra tangy.   The local beer from sedona (nut brown) and tempe (pale ale) are extremely flavorful.  The pesto salad is not that great (can't taste the pesto, should have tossed it).",

There has to be something in the water in that town.  The spot is in a nice residential area.  I was seated immediately.  I really love the flexibility with the pizza.  Unlike other pizza joints, they allowed me to split my pizza so that I could try different flavors.  I went with a 1/2 Salsiccia - tomato sauce, sausage and mozzarella and 1/2 Tartufata - mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and a drizzle of white truffle oil after the pizza is cooked.  It is everything it had be billed.   Service was attentive.  Price was very reasonable for what I got.  Worth the drive.",

I mean, I couldn't possibly ask for anything more.   The first thing you need to do is get the Burrata as an app... holy COW it's creamy, yummy amazingness on a plate. Funghi pizza is one of my faves. The Capricciosa pizza is also delicious. Okay before I remake the entire pizza menu... they're all amazing, it just depends on what you're in the mood for. When we visit here for birthdays or other special occasions that are deserving of dessert, we always get one of the crepes that have Nutella and other fun stuff in them so make sure you get one!  They have pasta night on Tuesdays and all of them I've had in the past have been great. Each Tuesday they feature two different pasta dishes, and it varies week to week. They have a great selection of wine and are great at suggesting a certain type you'll enjoy.   They also serve brunch and lunch. I haven't been to either but plan to head there for brunch soon! :)",

If you're going with a group, do yourself a favor and check out the menus ahead of time if you're planning on sharing any of the pizzas. We would have been able to order much faster if we hadn't argued for so long over which of the pizzas to get. We ended up agreeing on the quattro... whatever is Italian for cheese probably - and the red pizza with sausage. The 4 cheese white pizza is delicious, but very rich. I'd probably get a lighter one to go with it next time. Their pizza with arugula and walnuts perhaps (La Noce maybe? I can't remember all the actual pizza names).   On an interesting side note, a friend of mine chose to brave the line at Pizzeria Bianco last night, and wound up wishing he had gone to Cibo instead. Advantage Cibo!!",

First, our waitress was extremely rude and dismissive. I work in the restaurant industry and where service is concerned, she definitely failed. She was impatient with us, when my friend asked for a clean plate, she investigated the plate before deeming it worthy of being replaced. I kept asking for more water, 4 times and on the 3rd time she just ignored me, physically looked around me, while getting my friends drinks. Finally, the same friend ordered water for us because she was pretending not to hear me. The food was mediocre at best, which was really disappointing. Then we ordered dessert and got a crepe with nutella and strawberries. While it was delicious, there were maybe 3 strawberries in the entire thing, which was a drag since the bites with strawberries were so good. When it came to the check, she split it by \"couple\" took our payments and then completely forgot about one of the couples and just brought it back with the card, not run. We were all just stunned that she had added 20% gratuity to all of our checks (Im sure is policy with larger groups) but we would not have left it for her awful service. I can't recommend this place anymore, that's for sure.",

It's kind of a casual place but if you dressed up you wouldn't feel weird.

I actually took the GF & my parents there for a joint dinner.  They had never met before, and I was really banking the success of their meeting on Cibo's food and ambiance.  I can honestly say, mission accomplished!  Not that the restaurant had anything to do with the weather, but we had an amazing table outside (the only way to go here), under a tree in what turned out to be a cool Saturday afternoon. That was only the beginning.  Our appetizer plate was amazing, and definitely enough for four people to share.  This plate had enough variety, that even the pickiest of parents found something he/she enjoyed.    We all order pizzas, because none of us really knew how big they'd be.  The crust, cheese and toppings were everything we could have wanted. Crisp, warm and delicious.  The pizzas are big enough for two, and I'd actually recommend sharing with someone else (unless you want leftovers) because dessert is the best here.  You won't find many places that serve Nutella, let alone in homemade crepes.  The crepe with Nutella and banana was unbelievable and is a destination dessert in itself.  I'll come back just for that.  We also split one limoncello drink, which was so strong.  The parental unit was flying high after just sipping that once!  All in all, this place is excellent.  It is totally tucked away in a cool neighborhood, and is a great place for a date or to feel like you are escaping the suburban sprawl in PHX.",

It has a thin crust (which we loove) but it just seems to lack in flavor a little bit.  The crust is a little soggy towards the middle.

We sat outside and it was very enchanting! I forgot we were in Phoenix for a while, which is a good thing. Phx needs more places like this! Our pizza was good, but I would have preferred a little more spice. Our crepe was delicious! I would go back for that alone! Overall, we had a great experience and hope to get back there before the summer hits us so we can enjoy the quaint patio experience:)",

We are a party of 4 that loves pizza and hungry. We had the DiNotte, Salsiccia and the Genova pizzas. They all were excellent-- fresh crust not too thick and the dough had been allowed to rise properly. Toppings were all fresh and there are multiple non tomatoe sauce options which is to my liking. The Gorgonzola on the DiNotte pizza gave it a unique distinctive flavor(good). We also had 2 salads -- the house salad was very fresh. In my opinion the biggest distinction was the freshly grated Parmesan flakes. My wife had the only other salad offered prior to 3 on Sat which had strawberries, goat cheese, and candies walnuts over spinach. My wife added grilled chicken and enjoyed it all. The restaurant is not close to my house, however I will go back again when I am near downtown for lunch again.",

    "text": "After a glut of pizza watching on food network, I was on the hunt for some good thin crust pizza. Being in my third trimester, however, I wanted to avoid the hour long waits I was reading about all the pizza places in town, and decided to go during lunch time. Unfortunately, I didn't do my research enough and didn't realize that Cibo does NOT serve pizza during lunch, only sandwiches; pizza is only at dinner time.   After the initial disappointment, and being too hungry to go somewhere else, we decided to go ahead and order. For a weekday lunch, it was still pretty busy. No wait, but only seats available were at the bar, and just 2 seats were available. However it looked like the turnover was quick. Service by the guy at the bar was relatively quick and very friendly, but he was running around like crazy taking care of both customers at the bar and at tables.   All the sandwiches are made with the fresh baked focaccia made in the brick ovens. Very fresh and tasty. Not oily at all like a lot of other focaccia's I've had. Good texture, chewy without being tough. There's a choice of cold vs hot sandwiches, my husband and I both got hot ones...I got a mozzarella, tomato and pesto i think? Whatever it was, it was good. My husband got the pulled pork buffalo style...He enjoyed it...I'm not a big fan of buffalo style sauce so I can't really comment on it. You have a choice of side salad or fruit salad witht he sandwhiches, or chips, which we didn't get. The salad was fine, fresh, well dressed. The fruit salad was a bit of a surprise...more of a parfait w/ some thick whipped cream and granola on top. It was good, but being lactose intolerant, it came as a bit of a surprise, so just a warning for those who can't tolerate dairy, or thought they were being healthy by ordering a fruit salad.   Anyways, m/b I'll make to try the pizza one day...but the sandwiches were still worth the visit.",

It's a pretty little patio with trees hanging down and an organic feel to it.  Not pretentious, just pleasant.  And the staff's always been down to earth and decently cool.

We had the meat antipasto with capicola, salami, olives, various cheeses, roasted peppers, etc. and it was fantastic.  Afterward, our group shared white and red pizzas as well as a calzone which were all delicious. The menu is somewhat limited but what they do, they do right.  The old-home atmosphere was charming-we had a private alcove for our small group. Walking by the small bar area, it reminded me of intimate restaurants in homes in CT.  We're going back when it's cooler to sit on the outdoor patio with the tree lights, misters and take in the ambience.  Oh and to top it off, our waitress was one of the best ever and that's saying ALOT.  We've dined in a few places in our lives and have a good basis for comparison...she was excellent (just which I got her name!)  If you haven't been, you have to try this place.  It's worth the trip. We went on a Monday night and were seated right away...I hear it's insanely crowded on the weekend...I know why...it's good!",

Complete it off with dessert (Nutella and Banana) and you'll be in food heaven.

    "text": "And now to add to my list of pizza places, Cibo.  Here is how I rank the pizza of Arizona, and I've tasted a LOT of it.  1. Pizzeria Bianco  2. Patsy Grimaldi's 3. Cibo 4. Pomo 5. Humble Pie  . We ended up at Cibo because we were craving Grimaldi's (didn't have a car to get to the location in Old Town), we didn't feel like waiting for Pizzeria Bianco, and the light rail had a convenient stop around .4 miles away from Cibo. Easy walk over.    Cibo can best be likened to Pizzeria Bianco or Pomo in taste. The owners, both very kind people, were working as the hosts the night we came in. It was around a 45 minute wait at 8:00 on a Thursday, so I just talked with my two good friends while we waited. No big deal. The restaurant had a homely feel to it, as it is a renovated old house and it was family-ran.   The atmosphere of the restaurant had an older feel to it. More of a place for 25 year olds instead of a bunch of college students, but whatever. I'd highly recommend the outside tables for a date, it has a \"romantic\" feel to it. It is also a good place for large parties, although I think Grimaldi's is a bit more convenient.   Now, the food.  The bread. Wow. Great bread, only beat by Chris Bianco's bread or the Andreoli's bread. I loved it, definitely worth the $2! Had a great crunch to it and was very tasty. Europeans definitely put more emphasis on their bread than Americans!  The pizza came in a pretty timely manner considering how busy it was that night. I ordered my standard, Margarita with Spicy Salami (aka, pepperoni). No normal pepperoni here. :( They had a lot of other options as well, such as Salmon for your pizza and more! The pizza was excellent. The crust was great and all around it was delightful!   We didn't order Crepes, Salad, or Bruschetta, but I definitely want to try the Bruschetta and Crepes next time I go there. Both looked great! The restauraunt seemed to have a lot of good options for wine as well!  All around, an awesome place to be. We'll be back once school kicks up again.  P.S: Keep in mind their hours! They are closed Sundays.",

I had heard so many great things about this place, that perhaps there was a bit too much build up.  It was a bit of a wait on a weekend night, which is expected and not a huge deal. We sat on the patio, which is really pretty & has room for a lot of people, which is always a bonus in AZ.  Here's the thing, I can barely remember the pizza. No, I was not drunk. I had one glass of wine, shocker I know. It wasn't bad, it wasn't amazing, it was just decent pizza. Sure pizza is almost always good, but I expected much better that ok.",

The server was very well versed with the wine list, and the menu. She right away offered some appetizer ideas, and wine pairings. All good offerings. We decided on a bottle of Vipra rossa. It was over all a good wine, and went well with dinner. Also we ordered the 3 Pair Buschetta. This little gem was awesome. It came to our table on a cutting board type platter. Three little bruschetta slices each having a different topping. First was grape tomatoes and basil, the second had cannelini beans, and the third had prosciutto crudo and mozzarella. Ah mazz ING.      Being that I wasn't feeling super adventurous on the meal, I just ordered the Diavola pizza for one. Average pizza I'd have to say, was not very inventive. Good presentation though.    Service was a five.",

    "text": "I finally got to try out this place yesterday at my gfs baby shower. I was soooo excited that I finally made it here seeing that I have had a few friends continuously recommending this place. This could be a great date day/night place or a place you meet up with a group of friends. They offer both in and outdoor seating. I highly recommend outdoor seating:) Beautiful weather during the day and beautiful weather at night plus romantically lit up with small lights around the patio. We were seated on the patio right away around 1pm on Saturday afternoon. We had a party of 10 and had more than enough space.  There was a young boy singing and playing music on the patio, which made the overall ambiance and atmosphere even better especially on any day in Arizona:) The waitress filled our glasses with water and lemon right away. I thought it was a bit strange that the water came with a lemon already in the water because typically they don't and I also happen to be someone who does not like knowing that someone probably used there bare hands to put it there. We waited about 10 minutes until the rest of our party arrived and began ordering our food.   About 10min after we order, the majority of us ran out of water and additional drinks people had ordered. So we waited, waited, and waited some more until finally we were able to waive down a different waiter to refill our drinks. Our food began to arrive about 30min after it was ordered. I ordered the Rustica Pizza, which was highly recommended to me by multiple friends and boy was I pleased! The crust was by far the best part! It was semi thin with a crisp bottom crust. The prosciutto was very tender and melts in your mouth and the cheese was just he right amount. This pizza was AWESOME! I also tried some of the entrees around the table including the side salad, which was huge with a variety of organic veggies, fresh parm cheese and balsamic vinaigrette to top, the Caprese sandwich, and the Margherita Pizza, which were all great!   Half way through our meal we again waited without drinks for about 15min. We were at Cibo for a total of 2.5hrs and our waitress came by our table 4 times. With that being said we waited around for refills, waited about 30min for our table to be cleared of the finished plates and had to physically get up to get our waitress twice because we couldn't waive someone over to us. My gf had to wait a long time to open her gifts because it took the staff a ton of time to clear a table that should only take 2min to  clean. While we were waiting I decided to use their restroom. On my way there I noticed that the location of the restroom was hard to find and was shoved into a back corner where they also had shoved 8 sets of chairs. It order to get to the restroom I had to walk sideways about 10ft (and I'm tiny!) to the restroom to handle my business. The average size woman would not have been able to fit through such a small space, which to me raises a HUGE red flag. I went to wash my hands and to my surprise the paper towel dispenser was not working so I had to use me pants...lovely! When I got back to the table we finished unwrapping gifts and called it a day. Overall, I loved the food and ambiance and feel that the service we recieved was extremely poor considering that it was not busy at all and there was no excuse for it. I would not recommend this place to groups larger than 6 people and I would also advise anyone who goes here to be ready to test their patience when it comes to service:)",

Great place to sit outside and enjoy lunch in our awesome weather as well (note that lunch has a slightly different menu and includes sandwiches).  Favorites include the Omero salad, Prosciutto Crudo and Diavola pizzas, and the Fresca for dessert.  Recommended over Pizzeria Bianco.  I wish I could more stars for this place...",

    "text": "I was so excited to eat here based on reviews. Not sure if it was an off day but I will never go back. My server seemed mad I came in. Like I reminded him of someone he doesn't like....then we order etc etc. I get the charcuterie plate, 3 meats, 3 cheeses, 3 fruits. It came out with 4 meats (which was nice) but only 2 cheeses (1 which was a caprese salad with no basil), 2nd was the goat cheese like on the menu, and for the 3d cheese...they threw on the pear salad...but with no pears. Then the fruits! I got 3 slices of apple. Instead of 3 separate fruits, it was 3 apple slices. Instead of fruit, they sent out grilled veggies??? No. Not cool. I asked the lady for some fruit she came out with the kids fruit plate.  ok thats fine. I like my fruit cut up for that anyway .my kids didn't like the pasta (red sauce and plain) not sure how that got messed up but it was really bland.  Anyways...then when I got the check I got charged for the fruit plate. Ok out of an $80 check, what's $3? But still...I don't feel like I should pay $3 for something that should've been on the $20 plate. When I asked the waiter, instead of apologizing he got super pissy and turned around (like a diva) and said \"ok I'll take it off\" like not even being I'm any way caring that he gets tips. So then him and some other girl were talking about what shouldve been on the plate (I was proven right) then be rudely came back with the check and kind of tossed it in front of me and said \"thanks\". Thanks but no thanks guy, you totally ruined my whole cibo experience. I think I'll stick with the always gracious Pomo Pizzeria on 1st ave...BUT on the bright side, my daughters did like the margherita pizza and the pear salad was really good. I just had a messed up order and horrendous service.",

At first dear husband and I were a little sad that there was no pizza on the lunch menu but reading the sandwich descriptions and seeing some plates on other diner's tables, we figured it was fate.   My Alla Parmigiana - fried eggplant sandwich - was wonderful!  The thin crispy wood fire oven baked saltimbucco bread held the eggplant, mozzarella, parmigiana, tomato sauce and basil.  The flavors were the perfect combination of all things Italian.  Every bite was wonderful.  The house salad was the perfect pairing for a great lunch.  And we hope to get back to try the pizza soon!",

Also ordered a a nutella, strawberry, banana crepe and it was excellent as well. Now you're asking, why only three stars if the food was so good. Well, the service was pretty lackluster. It was pretty slow and apathetic overall. What really annoys me now is that the server asked me if I wanted whipped cream on my crepe and didn't mention that it was a $2 charge for it. It looks like they also charged $2 for strawberries which I think was included on the menu. My crepe ended up costing $14, which is a ripoff. For comparison sake, the pizza itself was $9. I shouldn't really care because I'm expensing it anyway but won't come back here just based on the principle.",

The service is always top notch, and the wonderful owners are always within sight. The whole restaurant is gorgeous of course, with the overhead lights and plants in the outside patio and the vintage, house-turned-restaurant on the inside. As previously mentioned, the food isn't amazing but it will do. The pizza is tasty but not the best. I remember the burrata and the caprese salad being pretty good. The nutella crepe was delicious.  Over all, I would definitely keep coming back to Cibo because of the perfect ambiance. Whether it would be a date, a birthday dinner or an intimate meal with your family, Cibo is the perfect place to be.",

We were looking for a comfortable place that would work for three generations: 2 boys, my wife and I, and the grandparents.  This place met the mark: we all really enjoyed the experience.  It was unseasonably cold, so we ate inside--if the weather is warm, I'd recommend eating outside under the lights.  There were plenty of people outside braving the 50 degree weather, as there are heat lamps there.  We were told the house that holds the restaurant is 100 years old!  We had three pizzas: Rustica, Vegetarina, and the Funghi.  Our six year old had the individual margarita pizza.  We also had two of the house garden salads; a large is good for two people.  Started with the risotto balls and the meatballs.  Everything was excellent, although the risotto balls were a bit bland.  Pizza crust was perfect--crunchy on the outside with a bit of char from the wood fired oven.  Like othe reviewers, we loved the Nutella and banana crepe with ice cream.  We had two scoops, and it was plenty to share among six of us...very rich.    Our waiter was really attentive, and the hostesses were nice.  We will definitely go back.",

AMBIENCE - Great for a romantic date night or evening out with friends. There was a Jazz band playing, but we were still able to have a conversation.  DOG FRIENDLY PATIO  SERVICE - Extremely friendly and accommodating, on busy nights patience is necessary as the service is much slower.   FOOD - Delicious!

There's street parking here and there, but I can walk!  Food:  Pizza, salads, sandwiches, bread, Nutella-based desserts, wine.  We ordered a pear salad that was tasty; it included arugula, pear, and cheese. The bread delivered with the salad was a white chewy bread.  My friend wanted meat on his pizza, and I didn't. They allowed us to get half and half; I got my veggie pizza on one side, and his sausage was on the other. Perfect!   The dessert we ordered was kind of like a delicious deconstructed funnel cake with Nutella for dipping sauce - delicious!    Service: The servers were efficient and brought us water throughout and were helpful and quick.  I wouldn't say the employees were overly friendly, though. While walking in, a female employee opened the door but just kind of stood there, not saying anything. No, \"welcome\" or \"hello\" - nothing.  Strange to me, but that's my Texan roots craving some more friendliness!   For reservations, one must have a group of six or more to make reservations.  We just had two but easily found a table on a Saturday evening at 5:30pm.",

Though it's hard to estimate wait time, you should be somewhat in the ballpark. Just left after waiting an hour to go to a neighboring taco joint and I just received notification that my table is ready after an hour and a half. They give estimated low wait times so you stay and after waiting for a while you figure you might as well stick it out just a bit longer. Shame on you guys",

They have live music on the patio outside which is a great addition to the vibe it displays, however I decided to sit inside which wasn't pleasant at all due to the lack of fans inside. The food wasn't what I expected it to be, even though I enjoyed the pesto. I don't recommend this place to others but if you wind up here it wouldn't be the end of the word being that they did offer great service when it came to offering opinions and being  on top of me and my family. Also if you come here and want a last minute drink, order the limoncello. Hope this is helpful as this is my first time coming to this restaurant.",

    "text": "I have been hearing about the great cuisines in Phoenix and decided to come to this popular Italian restaurant to get a first impression. Located in a house with a spacious front patio, the interior encompassed a full bar area, breakout dining rooms, hardwood floors, and red brick walls. A friendly staff, constant foot traffic, and opportunities for people watching added to the festive, home-like atmosphere. I came here for dinner with a group of five that included fellow Yelpers Fia R, and Kurdy S, and decided to order antipasti and two pizzas to share.   For antipasti, we went with the server's recommendation and ordered the Burrata ($14). The platter came with fresh mozzarella, balsamic drizzles, razor thin prosciutto, and toasted bread. I was impressed by the mozzarella, as it was light, airy, flavorful, and easy to spread across the warm crusty bread. The gentle flavors between the balsamic and prosciutto went hand in hand, as they complemented the mozzarella and bread without hindering it. This is a must get for those visiting for the first time.   Next, we shared the half Diavola and half Magherita Pizza ($13). The Diavola was pleasantly spicy, as the pizza was inspired by the centrality of spicy salame embedded in mozzarella and tomato sauce. I also enjoyed the Margherita, as the light tasting tomato sauce, mozzarella, and fresh basil were spot on delicious. One noteworthy limitation regarding their pizza was the soft crust. It had a nice flavor but the texture was also flimsy and unexpected.   Finally, we shared a half Procida and half Tartufata Pizza ($14). The Procida came with mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, Asian pears, chopped arugula, goat cheese and black pepper. The goat cheese flavor was very sharp, so I didn't particularly enjoy it as much as the other finesse tasting pizzas. The Tartufata arrived with mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and white truffle oil drizzles. I enjoyed the smoky flavor stemming from the pizza, but the combination of strong-flavored white truffle oil and cheese didn't go particularly well for me.   3.5 stars. Overall, it was a delicious meal with plenty to rave about. I suggest interested diners to be aware of possible long waits, especially for those arriving later in the evening. Additionally, I also would not suggest this place to those who have a strong preference for thin, crispy crust pizzas. Their desserts were also limited to crepes, which we didn't care for on that particular evening. I must say, the place is great for dates, but the noise level can be pretty loud. Despite these limitations, our water was constantly refilled, and we were attended to frequently without much interruption. It was a great way to start a new journey in Phoenix. I hope to find the perfect crust in the area before coming back.",

We got the tartufata (?) pizza, the one with mushrooms and drizzled truffle oil, because we're suckers for truffle anything. The taste and aftertaste were awful, the texture was kind of slippery and sloppy, and the pizza (though cooked in True stone pizza-oven fashion, so kinda expected) had a lot of black char dust on the bottom, which tasted very bitter. Our waiter didn't seem to care about our needs much; he didn't stop by a single time while we ate and it took forever to receive the check. But he DID keep trying to sell us extra stuff while we were ordering, which was annoying. Are the waiters here paid on commission, or what?  I was considering ordering the fried dough with nutella for dessert, but the service was so bad, and we were sitting outside so there were tons of flies around our food. We left. Would not go back.",

They did, however, rush the replacement pizza out which wasn't cooked properly. It did not have much taste either. The waiter did not offer a discount but oddly gave me the wrong amount of change for our bill. Wasn't too sure if this was his way of apologizing, but overall was a very lousy experience.",

It seemed crowded but there was plenty of room and we were seated right away.  The staff was super friendly and easy on the eyes if you know what I mean..haha...We ordered the Di Notti and the Funghi pies and washed it all down with some local craft beers (oak creek hfeweizen).  Everything about this place was amazing including the tab.  The views of the city are also great at night...Good job Cibo!  We will meet again some day soon I hope.",

Cibo is in a beautiful old home that makes it feel intimate and romantic - there's really not a bad seat in the house.  Service is consistently good.    Things you should know: they close from 2-5 on weekdays; they don't serve pizza for lunch and if I'm not mistaken, I believe they make fresh pasta on Tuesday's and Wednesday's.    My favorite wines: Chianti, Neprica, Aglianico   My favorite menu items: Burrata, margherita pizza",

    "text": "(I may get hate responses after this review and I contemplated in writing a POOR review of this place. After all this place is highly rated and suggested.)  Awkward, uncomfortable and RUDE is how our server made us feel with our party of only 4. We arrived during lunch time and we were the only ones at this restaurant. It was completely empty minus the employees.  We were seated immediately, but strangely our server obviously didn't want to be there at Cibo.  We informed it was our first time (at this OVERLY-hyped place) and was wondering what he would recommend? NO answer. We were interested in specials and asked if they offer anything with specials, he said NO not right now.  The server came and went numerously from our table and while we viewed the menu another party of 4 sat adjacent to us and a different server was cordial, polite and introduced himself by name, he relayed the specials of lunch and that dinner is approaching with happy hour specials.  My party and I were puzzled and said to one another, our server didn't relay any of this and why? He returned and we inquired about the specials, he said yes it's lunch still but we're approaching dinner soon. Can we still order off the lunch special menu? He said yes, but when my bf tried to order off the lunch menu our server then said \"I'm trying to PUSH the dinner\" and he said this Multiple times. I said, why? No response. Good for my bf when he stood firm on his decision and ordered off the lunch menu.    Now the food: Although, the pizza was flavorful the pizzas are quiet small, more like a personal size and the dough is SUPER THIN and couldn't hold up my lightweight vegetarian ingredients. As soon as I picked up my slice the toppings immediately fell over and there was absolutely no structure support from the crust. This made it extremely challenging to eat. I folded it, rolled it and I mean this was Ridiculous.  3 of the 4 of us had the same complaints about the pizzas and quiet frankly it's not worth the price of what you get, they need to work on the portion size and their dough needs to be able to withstand light vegetables at least.  We also had the desert dough with Nutella, the dough seemed extremely stale.  Back to our server: He came and went, back and forth and every time he seemed to rush us with everything, but what's wrong with us enjoying what we have been served and enjoying our company? I finally got so irked at the server and straight up asked him \"are you in a hurry to get somewhere?\" He said no. I said, you sure have been acting like you do. Our server abruptly changed to someone else and without explanation. Our bill got messed up and took awhile to fix. Unsure if it was due to the change in servers.  Again, (AWKWARD).  I also wasn't sure if I should mention, yet I'm going to tell it. We sat at the corner of the restaurant where many flies were and yes we dined Indoors.  It was extremely annoying swatting them while at the dinner table.  We regret trying Cibo out. There pizza size and quality was more like an appetizer and thankfully we were asked by mutual friends to have dinner at the Federal and it was a 180 degrees a positive turn around that Cibo can take note of.    Cibo is a cute place and I appreciate the restoration and flipping of a home into a business and their pizza is tasty, but they definitely need to improve on their customer service. Return factor: ZERO. Would I recommend it to anyone to give Cibo a shot? ABSOLUTELY NOT.",

We were looking to have lunch after going to the science museum with the kids and my handy dandy yelp app lead us here.   Loved the space! No pizza at lunch, just paninis with the same ingredients as on the pizzas. They don't have a kids menu but my kids are fine ordering from adult menus with some adaptations, of course, and our requests were honored with no problems. We all loved our sandwiches!  We are big fans of crepes so of course we had to have dessert.  The kids got the crepe with the vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce which they devoured. My husband and I got the crepe with nutella & mascarpone --- absolute perfection!  Do yourself a favor and get a crepe, you won't regret it!!",

So, so, so good. The Vegetariana pizza - mushrooms, artichokes, zucchini, and red peppers in quadrants. It's like 4 different pizzas in one. The second pizza had prosciutto on it, but I can't remember the exact name. It was, as expected, delicious. I wish we could go here more often, but being downtown it's farther from us than we'd like. Overall, the food and price are comparable to our other favorite places to grab pizza. I noticed that they do brunch and I can't wait to come back!",

Once I saw all the fantastic reviews, I decided to call to see how crazy it would be to 'walk in' for dinner. Turns out, not crazy at all! We walked the 5ish blocks from where we were staying to a cute, converted house. It was cozy, warm and welcoming. We were seated immediately at a table which overlooked a fountain in a small area of grass with lawn chairs. Service was perfect - fast enough to keep your stomach from eating itself, but not too fast that you run out of space on the table. We split an order of the calamari, T&K Salad and the Genova pizza. Everything was absolutely delicious and despite how full we were, we kept eating til it was gone! So if you're in the area, definitely stop by and give this place a try!",

    "text": "Why am I updating my review?  Dessert!  It finally happened!  I really enjoy introducing people to places they have never been, and I am happy to say Cibo recently gained two new fans of their charming outdoor patio and good food.  The three of us arrived just before the 5pm opening to ensure we could secure a table on the patio and enjoy the gorgeous first evening of Spring outside.  Everything we tried was fantastic, and I had the opportunity to sample two new-to-me dishes, the burrata appetizer (I have no words to describe how special and good this mozzarella is, especially when combined with the salty prosciutto, and a drizzle of aged basalmic) and dessert!         After selecting a chianti and the burrata, we decided to share two pizzas among us - the margherita and the rustica.  Both were excellent, with that slightly doughy wood-fired crust I love so much.  Ah, the dessert.  I think the trick to getting dessert with any meal is dining with guys.  There is no dainty \"oh no, I just couldn't eat another bite\" but rather \"which one do you want?\".  I like that.  We chose the Nutella and Marscapone cheese crepe, which was topped with a light dusting of powdered sugar and chocolate sauce.  So good, so worth waiting for - like hot chocolate, but on a plate.  Manners and politeness went out the door as our three forks fought for position.  I believe insults were thrown.  It is all fun and games until you get between me and some warm Nutella.  Back away slowly and you won't get hurt...  ;)",

The sauce makes or breaks a pizza for me.  The pizza here doesn't use a lot of sauce or cheese.  If you are a fan of good crust you may love this place but it is not my cup of tea.  I am spoiled since I am from Chicago where there are great pizza places everywhere.  Phoenix has a lot of places people tell me the are really good but I find most of them to be average at best.  It is hard to compare Lou Malnattis or Giordano's in Chicago to anything here.",

UPDATE - 09/24/2007 - I finally went to Cibo for dinner the other weekend and I can see why the reviews aren't as high as I would expect. The quality of the pizza is disappointing when compared to the quality of their sandwiches. However the pizza is still great (as well as affordable) and the atmosphere at this place is even better at night (especailly on an amazing night like last Friday).  But if you have been to Cibo for dinner and been dissapointed, I would recommend going and trying a Spek, Salsicca, or Vegetarian sandwich for lunch some day.",

My favorites are the Omero salad (or the Pear, also great), the Funghi pizza (although the Margherita is simple and tasty too), and the Fresca dessert. Only negatives are the lack of reservations and somewhat long wait if you come around 7-8pm. Totally worth it though.",

    "text": "For those of us who live in Phoenix, it is not a surprise to find  out that  there is an ongoing Pizza war amongst pizza aficionados. Topping the list one has to mention, in no particular order; Grimandis, Humble Pie, Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco. From home made mozzarella , to organic sourdough and the most expensive state of the art lava and wood burning ovens, eating pizza  here in Phoenix is a serious thing. As a  full blooded Italian,, I have to say one thing; I do not like pizza.....I lOVE IT. And with the company of my wife, I have made an effort to try and flavor every pizza establishment in the valley.The results have been outstanding and the experiences  worth writing in my pizza diaries. But as in beauty and love (and pizza) I guess one has to deal with subjectivity. We all have different tastes and preferences,  so when it comes to choosing the best pizza, we try to stick with originality in flavor and  the consistency of its dough..  and while trying them all, I have found exquisite flavors and combinations, different dough textures created by each unique oven, and one particular pie that distinguishes itself from all of the others  because of its simplicity and originality. And in my eternal quest to find the most original pizza, that is the one that most closely resembles the True pizza........the one that originated in the 1830s in Napoli, baked in an oven built with lava rocks from mount Vesubio,  I have to mention two contenders; CIBO and Pizzeria Bianco. For 15 years, Pizzeria Bianco located at 623 E Adams  street in downtown Phoenix, has been a favorite amongst pizza aficionados for making pizzas that truly resemble  a pizzeria Napolitana. Owner, Chris Bianco , decided that the only way to create an authentic pizza, was to travel to the place of its origin, Napoli, and learn the art of pizza making.  His internship paid well and today when one eats at his pizzeria, there is no doubt that his pizzas are a very close duplicate of what one would get in Napoli. Not even a mile apart, one finds another jewel in the pizza arena; CIBO Pizzeria.  Cibo translate simply into\" the food\". If you are a True pizza aficionado, you must try this pizzeria in order to truly understand the art in the making of truly artisan pizza. Karen and Tony Martingiglio are the owners of this small and charming old house located at 603 5th ave in downtown Phoenix. It resembles a True Italian osteria.( an Italian eatery where local wines are flavored and where people come to have a great time with friends and eat home made dishes) Friendly, charming, and warm, Cibo  makes you feel at home eating with your mamma. Pizzas here are crafted by a True transplanted pizza maker from Napoli; artisan Guido Saccone.  Pizza Margherita is probably an exact copy of what one would expect to eat in Napoli.  From the chewy lightly burned dough relieved with bubbling volcanoes,  to the simple earthy  tomato sauce and fresh basil, this pizza is heavenly. And if I was placed in the predicament of choosing my favorite, I  would undoubtedly pick Cibo; after all there is an authentic  artisan from Napoli crafting these wonderful pies.",

    "text": "pros  good pizza fancy , expensive but not outrageously expensive clean interior outside setting with heating lamps to add to setting.  good drinks (got a green tea, the name of the tea, called \"Infusion\", lives up to it's name!!!) the design of the outside, and inside, makes the place a 5/5 for the interior. the food is great! me and a friend shared pizza (toppings were meaty sausage and cheese). the bill didn't come out to a large amount. the wait was a tad excessive. there's a bar. friendly service.  cons: none for me, been here only once and will never be here again because we were tourists",

We started with some wine, the veggie plate which was much larger than expected (in a good way) and then the Genova pizza which is a white pizza with pesto, potatoes, onions, cheese and maybe a few others.  The wait staff was excellent too!  I look forward to my next trip to Cibo.",

Love the outdoor patio with the twinkle lights and the food is to die for!  The best pizza I've ever had!  My fav is the Salsiccia con Patate made with mozzarella, sausage and potato!  Their margarita pizza, Antipasto speciale and even the Nutella and banana crepe dessert are also delish!  I would reccomend this restaurant to anyone!",

The pizza is great (I prefer the fungi without the sauce), as is their version of caprese (which includes pesto and several sizes of tomato).  The cheese plate with the honey is also so so great!  Wine selection if also very good.",

    "text": "Oh the caprese salad.  It's what dreams are made of.  And the pizza. Oh and the desserts.  Well, pretty much everything is fantastico here at Cibo.  I wish I could kidnap the chef and turn him into my personal man-chef/slave so he could whip me up delicious Cibo-esque dishes whenever the mood struck.  I really am kidding about that.   Kind of.  But really, the food here is great, the service is fine and the prices aren't bad considering how great the food is.   The restaurant is a really cute, intimate place and my only problem with it is it's far away from my house!",

We were outside, and with the heaters, I didn`t mind, actually was a great evening outside! I had the veggie pizza, was delicious! Very generous portions and I ended taking some home. Wine list was mostly Italian wines and good selections. I`m pretty sure I will be back here!",

    "text": "Cibo never disappoints.  My guest and I decided to sit outside.  We had just missed the sprinkle of rain and felt safe under one of their umbrellas.  There was a hint of coolness in the air.  It was a great night.  Cibo's front yard/ patio is a charming spot.  Every time I eat at Cibo it has been on their patio.  I have yet to see the interior.  To start, we shared the House salad.  The greens were fresh, the cheese was awesome, and the dressing was excellent.  It served two people perfectly.  Next, we ordered the Veggie pizza.  It was delicious.  The crust is in between thin and doughy.  I like Cibo's crust, its the best of both worlds.  The veggies were fresh and the sauce was wonderful.  Our bill was around 20 bucks.  Cibo's delivers great quality for the price tag.",

    "text": "cibo met some kind of pizza ideal that had never been articulated in words for me.  the crust was thin, but not as thin as pizzeria bianco. the portions of cheese were slightly more generous than those of pomo and bianco. the red sauce was just slightly sweet and seasoned perfectly. my favorite pizza, though, was a white pizza, the genova, with pesto as the sauce, mozzarrella, parmesan, onions, and potatoes. perfect. this is the type of pizza, if it were healthier to eat such a thing every day, i would be eating 7 nights a week. i think adding ricotta cheese would make it even better, like it did for one of the red pizzas we tried, as cibo's ricotta has a pleasant nutty flavor. i can't count the places where i've added ricotta to a pizza and it had absolutely no flavor whatsoever, but not at cibo.  tried a salad, too, which was fresh though heavy on the vinegar in the dressing. also tried the bruschetta. the bread was good, but not as good as that of lamp pizzeria in north scottsdale, or second runner up ( bread-wise), pizzeria bianco. the bruschetta comes in a gigantic portion. three large, thick slices of bread split in half. one with buffalo mozzarella and a meat that looked like proscuitto (didn't try that one), one slice with grape tomatoes and basil (awkward to eat because the halved grape tomatoes are small and kept falling off), one with a cannellini bean and eggplant spread. this antipasti alone is very filling and i regret eating so much of it (especially the savory cannellini bruschetta) before the perfect pizzas arrived.  i can't wait to go back and try some more antipasti and pizzas at cibo. a cute place, an appealing menu well executed.",
