The waiter I had the pleasure of dining with had a fine sense of timing, patience and service.  My food was tasty and well presented.  Their egg white omelet with herbs was very well prepared, hot & the light avocado on top added a touch of creaminess!  Franky, I was surprised at how well this egg white omelet was prepared (compared to others I've tried).  And their french press coffee hit the spot (I couldn't imagine Starbuck's hitting the spot like this did...wow!).  Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.  Keep in mind that you're in an airport, so you may need to wait a few minutes at the podium for them to seat you.  Cheers to Chelsea!",

Read: zero flight etiquette and crew making stupid jokes attempting to make up for being an hour late that make my walmart shopper-filled plane snicker.  But i digress. Plenty o etiquette at this place. Sat at the bar. Jazz and latin over the speakers. Bartenders as they should be. Dressed in white with black vests. Attentive. Quick. On point. Not pushy. Got the menu. Ordered the french dip which did not disappoint. Good, crunchy on the edges bread...rare beef on the inside. Mmmmm. Didn't mind the spiced-mayo stuff that came with it.  Had the broccolini with parmesan and sauteed onions. Very good. Nobody slapped the check on my table two seconds after i stopped chewing. Respectful-like, see?  So, french dip is very good. The ceviche looked fantastic, too. Service was perfect. I will come here again. No longer mad because of my delay...belly-full and at peace.  Thanks, Chelsea.",

The restaurant is well located, pre-security which was perfect for us as we were headed in all different directions.  There were 6 of us with a 4 hour wait, our server came and offered help and we ordered and she came back regularly to see if we needed anything else. My husband and I travel a fair bit and we've spent several hour in airport restaurants and our \"typical\" experience for service is mostly \"probably won't see these people ever again, so what\" but not yesterday. Our server, Brittany was amazing! She was fun, always smiling, had great energy... Single handedly she concluded our weekend in Phoenix with laughter and fun, having us all smiling as we took different direction heading home.  Thank you Brittany for being You! We really appreciated your service! Hope to catch you again on our next travels through Phoenix!!  PS: Butternut Squash Soup was amazing! :)",

That's only for the pre-made salad and once they run out you have to pay more for them to make one for you. It's $6 more and the chicken is bone in from their rotisserie.

It's a very nice place with great atmosphere and a great place to get out of the rush  and have a nice meal.  The food is good and very good, the service is efficient with touches of friendliness.  When a restaurant has chicken tortilla soup on the menu I usually order it. For some reason that's a trigger for me on how well the rest of the meal will turn out.  The version was good and i might order again. Chicken in dark meat and shredded with fresh chunks of avocado  My all time favorites if you care come from Wolfgang Puck and Max & Erma's. To me it's as much about the garnish as it is about the soup and when you don't give me a lime I am disappointed  Our Cheviche was very fresh and the prime rib taco where  excellent.   Overall a good meal and I will have to try the original next time I fly through",

It's cool that the menu has a little airplane icon next to the dishes that are fast to make so you can make it to your flight quickly.

I got the kale salad (not a big fan) and the tortilla soup (okay).  The best thing we got were the prickly pear margaritas.  Mmmmmm.

Once you get past security, every food source is packed and seats at which to enjoy your marked up food are far and few between.   Having learned this the hard way in the past, I grabbed a sandwich at the \"To Go\" part of Chelsea's Kitchen. Had \"The Commuter,\" which consists of eggs, bacon, tomato and mayo on an English muffin. It also includes a tasty side of fresh fruit.   A kind woman took my order with a smile and forewarned me it would be about a 10 minute wait because the kitchen was backed up. Okay so it was a bit longer than 10 minutes. It happens.   Sandwich was good. Fruit was good. All perfect before boarding a flight...where you get to eat whatever you can find on the floor.

Usually, I end up eating VERY bland until I am at my destination. This place has a great menu with a variety of foods you can make paleo or whole30 friendly. I had seared ahi on a lettuce wrap with avocado and veggies (confirmed made with olive oil and not butter, by the way). It was actually VERY tasty and well seasoned. Tender and delicious! Avocado wasn't all hard, was perfectly ripe, and the asparagus was cooked to tender but not mushy. Yay! A healthy place that's not bland: it's tasty!",

This week my wife flew in earlier, and I went to pick up dinner for us both. The issue is, I paid for two meals and only came home with one. The Manager has not seen fit to call me back.   We will no longer be paying for this poor service in regard to your take home menu. I ordered from the bar and my wife has had issues with the bartenders not serving her as a woman but serving the males who come after her first.

We were graciously greeted, and we were seated immediately.  On the menu, there were a whole bunch of selections that had an airplane symbol next to the item.  Those were the ones that would be served within 8 minutes!  HOW FANTASTIC!  Each item was delicious, the service (Mike or Mark) was perfect and the place was beautifully decorated.  We happened to sit next to a cake display stand with chocolate chip cookies that were FREE samples!  I really enjoyed every aspect of the visit.  (It really was great to see a friend I hadn't seen in 20 years, all the while having the perfect restaurant experience.)  Thank you Chelsea's Kitchen!  Well done!",

I typically stop here for a meal before going through security to catch my flight out.  This morning I inadvertently left my cell in the hired car.  Khristopher, my waiter at Chelsea's Kitchen, let me borrow his cell phone for 15 to 20 minutes so that I could make some calls to track down the driver and ask him to turn around and bring my phone back to the airport and meet up with him.   I recovered my phone and prevented what would have been a very difficult trip (I know, what did we ever do without these things).  Summary:  Above and beyond service --- thanks Khristopher.",

Their dessert menu consisted only of gelato. We both ordered some. Edward suggested maybe we would like to try the key lime pie. One of my favorites and very happy to try! Easily the best key lime pie I've ever had!!! Even though our bill was only slightly over ten dollars, Edward could not have been nicer.

After a dozen or so meals here I can give you a pretty good idea of what to expect.   The location is great, terminal 4 outside of security between the A & B concourse. Very nice design and comfortable.   Unfortunately that is about where things go south. The service is abysmal, it takes forever to get your food and more often than not the food is cold. This morning I ordered a hot breakfast sandwich which came out room temp and the turkey was refrigerator cold. The one bright side is our waiter was very attentive today.   So let's talk about the caliber of service. Who trains these people? The hostess practically ignored us indicating that when the other lady returned she would seat us. Hello, the place was dead, show some initiative and seat a customer. First impressions really do matter. After waiting a minute the lady who did seat us didn't say a word or make eye contact. Hello again, customer service rule, make guests feel like you want them in your establishment.   Whoever trains the people at the airport gets an F as the experience in no way resembles what you get at the 40th street location.   If I were Chelsea's I would be concerned that the additional revenue would not be worth a tarnished reputation.",

The kale salad is bright with just a hint of lemon is a perfect companion with the short rib perfectly braised. You don't need a knife cause the meat is butter soft and tender.  Get this dish!

I was greeted and seated promptly. I got my drink right away and off to the menu I looked.   Decided on the soup and salad--- Chicken tortilla soup and Brussels sprouts salad. I waited about 8 minutes and got my food. First impression? It looked so delish! The salad was bright green and the soup was very fragrant. Time to dig in!!   The verdict??? The chicken tortilla soup was good thick, rich, chucks of chicken and some avocado. It reminded me of the chicken tortilla soup at La Grande inside the terminal. It was good--- solid! I would order it again.   The salad-- the Brussels sprouts were blanched then leafed. Topped with crumbled bacon, cheese (I think its Manchego) currants, cranberries and peanuts. I took my first bite--- lemony but a little sweet. The Brussels sprouts were  so crunchy, the bacon was yummy. The dressing paired very well with everything. I had also ordered a side of chicken. Ok let me tell yah, that was the best rotisserie chicken I've ever had!!! Moist, flavorful and almost melt in your mouth!   I finished everything! The waiter was very quick so I was in an out in 35 minutes. Got back in the terminal and Phoenix was left behind the fumes of the jet plane while I was left thinking about my lunch.",

My boyfriend got the short rib tacos and I got the Rib-eye tacos.

The devil eggs were one of the best I've ever had.  Restaurants at the jetBlue terminal in JFK has one of the best airport food all around, until I tried Chelsea's Kitchen that changed.

With all this components coming together on the plate, what could go wrong? The watery lake in the bottom of the bowl almost killed the dish. The lettuce was swimming in this pool of liquid that came from both the tomatoes and the wet lettuce itself. Unfortunately, the damage had been done.  Note to Chelsea's Kitchen: DRAIN AND DRY THE LETTUCE!! Also, pre-mixing the tomatoes and shrimp contributed to the disaster.   Bright spot: my waiter was awesome!! Attentive without being overbearing, yet tuned into my needs with an almost preternatural ability. I tipped him well despite the lettuce... not his fault.",

We asked about a couple of the menu items and figured two of us were planning to get the same thing so we asked about it and the server indicated the sandwich was 'huge' so we ordered it and asked to split it. They were very accommodating.  The food had good flavor and was well-prepared.  Good experience for eating in an airport. Thanks.",

We ordered deviled eggs and couldn't figure out how many eggs for them to put bacon on, when she wisely suggested she would bring it on the side.  The eggs were good - a little too much sweetness (sweet pickles? pimentos?) for our taste, but entirely satisfying.  Also ordered the tuna tartare/guacamole appetizer.  It was good.  I had the ahi tuna tacos and the fish was seared just right and had good flavor - along with the sides of guacamole, salsa and cabbage (I think), there were a couple of sauces to add to the make-your-own-tacos dish - and they were yummy too.  Hubby had the short ribs taco dish and thought it was delicious.  Daugher ordered the special soup, which was a canteloupe/honeydew gazpacho-type concoction.  She wasn't fond of it (even though she loves those melons) and the server was great in recognizing that and with no hesitation offered to substitute the chicken tortilla (I think) soup instead.  That bowl disappeared so fast it would make your head spin, so it was a good choice.  The drink menu was very nice, with a Tito's vodka rounding out an adult lemonade beverage.  And, of course, the nice little salted chocolate chip cookies as you leave are delicious.  I would definitely return. PS-3 stars because the food is A-OK; extra star for the excellent service.",

Expensive, probably because of the location but it's just not that good. The regular Chelsea's kitchen is fine but the airport just seems to be phoning it in.  By not being a fast food chain it stands out, but I don't think anyone would come to the airport just to have lunch here.",

    "text": "I live in Phoenix and have never been to either location of Chelsea's Kitchen before, but since I live so close to the airport, I thought I would give this place a try since I love Ingo's and this restaurant is part of the LGO Hospitality group. Upon arrival and requesting to be seated in the back so that I wasn't in the front under the florescents and throngs of travelers walking by, the reaction from the hostess was one of bewilderment and unhappiness, as she didn't want to seat us in what was supposed to be closed section, even though there were already people there. The excuse was that they were understaffed too. Not a very good impression to give to a new customer, but we ended up there anyway, go figure.  SERVICE: our server, while she seemed a little frazzled, tried her best to be very attentive. Maybe it was the holidays or the short staffed situation or that she was possibly employed by the airport rather than directly by the restaurant that made her unhappy, who knows. Another server, maybe from the bar, poured my wine and spills a little in the process on the table, but had no desire to wipe it up. Really? You want me to clean up after your mess?  FOOD: I was hoping that they would have the same menu as their other restaurant and was looking forward to ordering the Dixie pan-fried chicken, but it wasn't on the menu. So I opted for the meatloaf instead. Unfortunately, both the meatloaf and mashed potatoes were barely lukewarm and the broccoli was literally COLD and very under cooked (and I like crunchy veg); there was no way this dish came out of a hot pan or pot recently. And the meatloaf was dry and overcooked, lacking any kind of juiciness or color, just a block of brown meat in very little sauce. My dining companion's burger was hot, so I'm assuming my dish died in the window waiting for his dish. I wanted to send it back, but since our server didn't check on us for quite a while later and my companion was almost done with his burger, I didn't bother. Besides, the clock was ticking on my parking.  We dine out a lot and we have our local favorites so it's been a long time since I've tried a new restaurant and was very disappointed. It's not a great experience when you feel like you are being punished when you have done nothing wrong.",

But instead of hiking to those gates, we just sit down to a nice dinner at Chelsea's Kitchen.  It is wonderful to have the many Phoenix based restaurants in Terminal 4.  It makes me feel like even if you just come through the airport you can see something that truly represents Phoenix while you're there.  Even when there is a wait at this restaurant the service is always fantastic.  If they mess up your order they do everything they can to make it right (it gets busy, and I become extra understanding, esp if they try to rectify).  We've done breakfast, lunch and dinner, all yummy and a great start to our trips.  I'm generally not a fan of airport food, but I always look forward to dining at Chelsea's Kitchen if we're headed to the airport. :)",

I was expecting three little tacos, so I was surprised to get a generous slab of meat with 4 homemade corn tortillas and fresh guacamole and pico de gallo on the side. The portion size and the high quality of the food explained the $26 price tag. I'm not the first reviewer to say how delicious the short ribs are here. Probably the best I've had anywhere.

The problem, as I like to define it is this: The lure of a fine meal, fast service and reasonable prices simply won't dispel the shame associated with blowing a valet.   Hello Chelsea's Airport. A mere five miles from the original located in Terminal 4, this location is never crowded and, if you're in a hurry, they offer a Chelsea's Express window adjacent to the entrance.  On my most recent visit, the rotisserie prime rib was in order. Fortunately, they had an end cut available, making the experience even more enjoyable. The sides were equally delicious. Blanched, cold green beans in a light lemon vinaigrette along with a DD-cup of garlic mashed potatoes. Nom. Nom. Nom.   Oh, and the parking is ample, Sky Harbor Terminal 4 charging only four dollars per hour. Four bucks! That's it.  A lot less messy too.   Any bets on how long it takes for YelpHQ to remove this one? I've never made their ROTD award, but I do routinely win their other ROTD award. \"Removal of the Day.\"",

    "text": "Love this place! I was waiting for my flight and had some time to burn and needed to eat dinner, and since I'd never been to Chelsea's Kitchen I decided to give it  a shot.   Big props to the creators for really thinking about what consumers might want. My phone was in dire need of charging, and it was one of the FIRST things I asked the hostess when I walked up. She said all bar seats had outlets, and since I was by my lonesome I really didn't need or desire a table. It drastically cut down my wait. But they really thought about the typical airport traveller when they put that feature in- so cool!  Phone plugged in and merrily charging away, I sat down and was fairly quickly given a menu. For my drink I got the French Sailor- delicious, fresh and refreshing and light, just the way I like my drinks. For my meal I got the fried chicken sandwich (what can I say? I was going on vacation. Calories don't count!). Both were fantastic. The sandwich came out promptly, and their fries are shoestring fries- my favorite. It does have a bit of kick- I think there is sriracha in that aioli, so beware.   Now as a side note- it was a bit difficult to get my bartender's attention. I attribute it largely to being busy, really. Once I did he was prompt, friendly, and very helpful. I noticed it got MUCH better once the large majority of the patrons around me took off for their flights. So take note that if it gets busy you might have to wait a bit. Thankfully I wasn't in a rush.   It does make me want to eventually check out the 'real' Chelsea's Kitchen. This place was pretty cool and I'd make sure to stop by next time I'm in T4 at Sky Harbor!",

I remind her it's a little past three.  She says, \"Oh, the dinner rush\". I mention again it's just after 3pm.  She lets me know the rush starts early. She offers another table tucked in the corner.  I think great, it's a less desirable table but with more space.  She leads me to another 2 top.  I tell don't bother I'll take my business elsewhere.

While I don't think they're normally known for their service, the standards for this place have been raised more than a few notches.

I didn't get to eat , my wine was too late to the table to drink so for 70.00 for one meal And few drinks I had miserable experience. I frequent  the Phoenix location many, many times. This makes the second bad experience i have had at the airport location. Don't waste your money. It is NOT worth it",

(Maybe I am was just really hungry but they were fantastic). All told we were in and out in 45 minutes and it was very busy. Highly recommend and love the little treats they offered on the way out.",

We ordered a couple drinks, beers were actually reasonably priced and they had good local brews. We started with chips and guac which was pretty good, could have used a tad more salt, but very good.  I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and it was absolutely delicious, I was shocked. It tasted like restaurant quality and not typical airport food. The fries were also very good. My colleague got tacos and the plate was massive she couldn't finish it, it looked very tasty. The place was pretty big and you almost forget you are in an airport. The service was very good.  This is definitely a solid choice if you're in the airport in Phoenix!",

Drinks did take a bit of time as the bar handled them but overall I had a good experience.   I ordered the Howie Burger - Havarti cheese, caramelized red onions, Dijon sauce - wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun.  I had the kale salad as the side instead of fries (even though that is what I really wanted).  The burger was very tasty.  Loved the cheese on top and the Dijon sauce was not too mustardy.  And the kale salad was great.  Lots of cheese in it.    The waitress let me work and did not bother me too much and brought refills when she could.  Definitely a nice spot for dinner if you have the time over the fast food options.  Also they had TVs so you could watch whatever game you were interested in.",

Refills, extra tortillas, and service were at quick and great timing. Not an easy thing to do!   I enjoyed the overall ambiance of the restaurant.

When the dish came out, I had low expectations because the cauliflower was cold and the top bun was also cold already. I cut the burger in half and the patty was well done throughout, so I was already disappointed before I even took a bite.  The cauliflower (although cold) was very delicious. It was roasted with thyme and parmesan cheese and tasted perfect-- not too soft, cooked just right.  The burger was also really good. The carmelized onions had a citrus-y tang to it that made the burger mouth-watering. The patty was just a tad overcooked, but didn't bother me at all when I was eating it.  I also finished with a scoop of pistachio gelato because I LOVE my ice cream!! I was pretty disappointed with the ice cream though.. it was very dense and not as smooth as gelato is supposed to be. Definitely lacked pistachio flavor (minus 1 star).   FREE BOMB COOKIES on each side of the hostess stand. And when I say BOMB, I mean they're really friggin good. I should've grabbed 2 to make up for the mediocre pistachio gelato.  I'll definitely come back if I'm ever at PHX. I want to try the short rib tacos everyone's talking about!",

All our plates came out separately and once finished sat for another 20 minutes to get cleaned - luckily had left lots of time for flight!  update- manager was so nice and comped our meal / give it a go but leave enough time",

When she put down the menus I thought I would take a look though I wasn't hungry. The menu featured fun and interesting house cocktails including white sangria.  I was torn but stuck with the plan for a bloody and I wasn't disappointed. The food options were also a welcomed surprise compared to the usual turkey sandwiches you would expect at an airport. We decided on the shrimp ceviche and it was awesome -fresh fish, crispy chips, avocado. This is a huge step above the norm and think it's a must when traveling through the Phoenix airport.",

Having tried every other spot in the LGO family, I was really impressed with Chelsea's in Terminal 4.  read in the paper this restaurant was evacuated due to a fire which occurred about 2 weeks earlier, however no signs of damage. Unfortunately, I rarely fly Southwest but the inter terminal bus comes every 5 minutes.   This restaurant is very large for an airport and actually makes you feel as though you aren't in an airport. This is wonderful unless you miss your flight. The service was up to the LGO stand, though not Misfit which is by far the best run in their family of restaurants, from a customer perspective.   We had the kale salad with salmon, crudo and ahi tartare along with some good red wines as it was post-large lunch and not quite dinner. Everything was of the quality I'm extremely used to at LGO, meaning excellent ingredients, prepared perfectly with \"special\" presentation.  Great job and I look forward to returning!",

I finally settled and the tuna tartare with avocado. It was fresh, well-balanced, and came with enough chips (which, for some reason, is a rarity with this dish at other restaurants). It did have more onions than I would have preferred, but when eaten with everything else, I didn't even notice.   Maybe the best part is that at the front they have a plate or chocolate chip cookies with fat salt crystals. The cookies were free and had no strings attached, which is rare (especially in an airport) and a very nice surprise.   The only reason this place gets 4 stars is the price. I get that it's in the airport, but it was absurdly overpriced.",

The food isn't quite on a par with the main restaurant, but it'd still qualify as good restaurant food. A burger is a respectable upscale burger that I'd call pleasant yet unmemorable... but the fries! The fries! The fries are even more addictively amazing that Smashburger fries. Whoever was in the kitchen is the maestro of fries. Whoever's choosing their wine is also brilliant. Given usual mark-ups, my choice is probably pretty cheap in the bottle, and it had the dimensions of something much pricier.  The push from 4 stars to 5 was that I went here hoping that an airport might have servers familiar with the concept of \"lone woman diner,\" so I'd get decent service. My server was wonderful: present without being obtrusive, helpful, and generally everything I could ask in a server. She got a 33% tip. That won't pay anybody's rent, but it's better than an empty table.  It's great living in the future.",

    "text": "Today was evidently an \"off\" day for this restaurant. Came in for breakfast, which was very good quality and came out quickly, but there were literally only 6 or 8 people in the entire restaurant eating. The overall demeanor of the various staff members was one of \"stress and tension\". They were not directly mean or rude to me, and my waitress was very responsive and pleasant, but I am a people watcher and was literally stressed out by the time breakfast ended as I watched the employees.  Watching the interactions, it seemed that everyone was either unhappy with management (perhaps they had a team meeting prior to opening & were scolded) or maybe their co-worker(s) were not all pulling their weight. The staff was looking over their shoulders - looking to see where their coworkers and managers were. What appeared to be a manager was walking around with a clipboard and she was watching every move of the staff and writing things down.  I asked my waitress if everything was ok, as it really appeared that it was a bad place to work. She said the computer had gone down and thus she was just a little stressed out. However, my receipt was printed from the computer (obviously was working) and there was basically no one in the entire restaurant  (I didn't buy that excuse for even a second - so I told her that I really hoped her day would get better). She said thanks and then ended up in a serious conversation with one of her co-workers.   A restaurant experience goes beyond just the quality of the food and how fast it is served. If the staff is not in a good place - that stress can be seen and felt by the patrons who are seeking a relaxed and enjoyable meal experience. As an onlooker - it looked like working here is not fun and that management must be trying to run the business with an iron fist, rather than a respectful and pleasant workplace environment. Whatever the reason, it felt like a stressed out, cold and disengaged French restaurant experience. Hope they are able to work things out - as perhaps more people will want to come in then, as the food was very good.",

The other bartender who helped me towards the end was wonderful, hostesses lived up to the name and food was amazing. I got the Brussels salad and it filled all of my cruciferous desires (is there such a thing??) It was huge so I took some to go along with their salted chocolate chip cookies, again, the cookies came recommended by my friend. You can grab a few small ones in their glass case by the hostess stand or buy a huge one at their grab and go spot for $3. Really, if it wasn't for my crappy bartender this place would be a five so it's definitely a legit spot for food when at Sky Harbor!",

When I was seated, the waitress quickly greeted me and brought me water. I briefly glanced at the menu, when my radar honed in on \"prime rib.\" The waitress asked, \"it comes with mashed potatoes and Swiss chard w/bacon, is that ok?\" Hecks to the yeah! I ordered the meat medium rare and when it came out, it looked beautiful. I proceeded to try the chard and that was yummy. The mashed potatoes. hmm. I know that this is personal preference, but I prefer my mashed potatoes thick not that thin almost watery type consistency, and that's how these were. :-( The meat itself was pretty and had good flavor, but was waay too tough. So that was a big bummer. Service was great, food was ok- so 3 stars it is.",

    "text": "***Chelsea's Kitchen is an upscale and surprisingly good contemporary restaurant located before security at the Phoenix International Airport***  Chelsea's Kitchen is a Phoenix restaurant that has expanded to the Phoenix International Airport.  Dining at Chelsea's Kitchen feels like dining at an actual standalone restaurant and not an airport sit-down eatery serving mediocre food at outrageously high prices.  Chelsea's Kitchen at Phoenix International Airport has an attractive contemporary look--lots of dark lacquered wood.  The menu features a variety of options including several courses that can be made very quickly if you are in a hurry.  You will find several restaurant style starters, a few burgers, upscale taco plates, and hearty entrees like seared fish, prime rib and ribeye steaks.  I started with the tuna tartare and guacamole.  It came with a tower of tuna tartare at the base with radish and soy-lemon vinaigrette and a topping of creamy guacamole.  The tuna tartare and guacamole tower was served with a large portion of tortilla chips.  Overall, the starter had a good flavor.  The tuna was fresh and moist while the guacamole was very creamy.  There was nothing particularly special about it though and the tuna tartare could have used more heat.  The chips were okay and had a good crunch; they were a tad salty.  I also had their braised beef short rib tacos, which came with a very generous portion of beef short rib and then several accompaniments to make a taco including corn tortillas, lettuce, guacamole, and pico de gallo.  The substantial entree also came with a side salad of kale, which featured interesting garnishes including roasted garlic and strong cheese.  Like the tuna tartare, the ingredients with this entree were very high quality and the overall flavor was good but nothing special.  I wish the braised beef short rib had more heat and seasoning, but there was no doubt the beef was very nicely braised; the fat was rendered down and the meat was very tender and juicy (very unlike a lot of airport eateries where you get dry proteins).  All of the garnishes were very fresh.  For dessert, Chelsea's Kitchen offers a signature key lime pie as well as several gelato flavors from a local gelato shop (Grateful Spoon).  I had the pistachio gelato and it was good and creamy though it tasted more like ice cream than gelato.  Service was good--quick and friendly.  Prices at Chelsea's Kitchen are high like other airport restaurants, but the quality of ingredients was significantly better than most airport restaurants I have been to and the portions were very generous.  Chelsea's Kitchen is a nice airport restaurant.  I wish it was located past security though so it could be enjoyed by more people (travelers on layovers as well as people departing Phoenix who want to get through security and settle down before dining).  If you arrive at Phoenix International Airport and have time to kill though, Chelsea's Kitchen is a good option and more satisfying than most airport restaurants.  I am not sure what the parking situation is at Phoenix International Airport, but I imagine parking here is expensive like other airports.",

But once you step in and are surrounded by dim lights and swanky lounge/jazz music, if you didn't look up and see a plane headed to a gate you'd be hard-pressed to remember that you are at the airport.  We had time to linger because we had dropped off the car about 2 hours early [pro tip: if you drop off at least 90 minutes ahead you can check your bags at the rental car facility] and took time to relax. My wife enjoyed the kale salad and I had an excellent green chile burger. Some items are flagged as ready in 8 minutes or less (presumably those are pre-made) and others can take some more time. But we had the time and also enjoyed some gelato for dessert.  This restaurant is a great place to decompress before you face the security line. The food is much better than anything you'll find in an airport. The only thing that reminds you that this is an airport concession is the price. Our server was attentive and friendly.",

We saw they had hand squeezed orange juice which is a big thing for me so I was sold on trying their sangria. So we get to the bar where two people were working and made some great small talk, the gentleman's name was Winfield and the ladie with a huge smile on her face ready to pour our drinks was Kimberly. BTW, the chairs were super comfy as I'm a big boy and sometimes the seats just scream, \"I hate fat people!\" but not here thankfully! Our group of 4 had a round of the sangria, and then half of us ordered the fancy drink of Goose pear, some other liquor and muddled cucumbers which made for the more light and refreshing drink I've ever had! The perfect mix of alcohol and I believe soda water to make our flight to New Orleans that much easier :-) Had some great convorsation with Kim getting laughs and sharing stories about vacations. Such a friendly staff that makes the hell of traveling a little more fun. I did not try any of the food so I cannot comment on that. Will be going there for drinks anytime we are going to the airport!",

Service was top notch from Host and Waiter.  Big screen TV allowed us to watch Tiger clean up @Firestone while we ate.  Don't lose track of time though... the restaurant is outside of TSA.

Hadn't eaten since the day before and was famished and didn't know when my next meal would come. The prices seemed kind of high, but it's an airport joint, so I figured I'd give it a shot, so I ordered a green chili burger. Took awhile to come out and when I took the first bite, the burger was warm, not hot, with a lot of pink inside. I should have sent it back but I was in a hurry and just ate it. For the price it was nothing exceptional and I left thinking I should have just ate at the Burger King and saved money (and I'm no fan of BK).   Man, I should have ate at Burger King because at 3:30 a.m. I woke with my guts twisting. I haven't been that ill from food poisoning in many a year.

He calmly explained that the salad was prepared in advance this way.  But he would be glad to suggest other items.     Without an ounce of hesitation he removed the salad brought the menu back and patiently explained other options.  What it came down to was creating my own green dish - avocado, tomatoes and sunflower seeds.  It came promptly and was delicious.   My friend's meal was also very good.

I was seated promptly and spoke to the waitress, Christina, about vegetarian options and, on her recommendation, ordered the veggie burger (no bun) and the side veg of broccoli rab, which she described as \"yummy\"and asked for a glass of water with a slice of lemon. Water arrived: no lemon. Food arrived, delivered by someone other than Christina. Burger on large slab of iceberg lettuce. I  took a first bite of burger--lukewarm temp. But the sauce on the side was good. Brocolli rab was cold. When (with the assistance of the gentleman at the next table), I was finally able to get Christina's attention, I asked if the vegetable was supposed to be cold. No, she said. So, I sent it back. Take two: at my prompting, Christina reached over to the bar and dumped a piece of lemon into my glass of water. A third person came to my table with a veggie burger and broccoli rab but no sauce. I tried to point out to him that the sauce was missing and he waved me away. I tried the brocolli rab the second time--this time literally handing a piece to Christina and asking her if she thought it was warm. She didn't. She asked me how the burger was this time around and I said that as I was still waiting for the sauce chances were that if it were hot, it wouldn't be by the time that I got the sauce and a third try on the vegetables. Decided to find a place that can actually serve hot food--maybe even the first time.  So much for fab food at the airport.",

I would have loved to have some shredded lettuce or cabbage and/or chopped tomatoes.   The sauce served with tacos tasted more like gravy that had some hot sauce thrown in.  And it was room temp.   Meat was fork tender, tasty and it was a large portion.  Tortillas were decent.",

What was meant to be a quiet and relaxing evening out turned into an unanticipated and unfortunate dine and dash experience.",

We ordered an appetizer, two ribeye tacos and a kids meal.. With the ribeye tacos being $26 each, I expected to be able to consume them.. There was an exorbitant amount of gristle and fat in the meat making it difficult to cut let alone eat.. I would have brought it to the attention of our server but he never checked back in on us and I ended up following him to another table to get our check!   I immediately sent an email to Chelsea's Kitchen directly to their website  and supplied photos and the receipt for $90.00 but to date no one has reached out to contact us.  This is not the quality of food nor service that has given Chelsea's Kitchen the good reputation they have enjoyed",

We can do better than that when it comes to portioning out boiled water.   Per usual, the customer service was above par. Of course, there's never a complaint about the free salted chocolate chip cookies.    They are so addicting I could eat a whole plateful......they use real butter   Overall I think a solid four stars fits the bill due to today's lack of value for the money.  Don't get me wrong I absolutely love the vibe of the restaurant and have never had a bad meal so if you subscribe more to the thought of quality over quantity than be sure to stop in for a bite. I just wish there was a little more quantity of their quality food served.",

Thought is the key word here. We both ordered the soup and caesar salad with chicken. Pretty hard to screw up right? Wrong again. Both soups were cold, not supposed to be, and the salad with chicken was just plain bad. The salad had a very light amount of dressing and the chicken was dry. Also, we waited at least 20 minutes for our soup and salads, long enough to drink our can of diet coke, yes can, that they charge over $2 for. Here's the kicker, when we told our waitress she said that the bowl has a lot of surface area and it cools the soup down and the other was never heated to the proper temp. What the heck?   Anyway, I will not be returning there again for very overpriced bad food. I'ld rather get food from one of the kiosks past security.",

Let it be said that the onsite manager, Diane, does not understand the concept of hospitality or exceeding customers expectations.  We asked for some more almonds or toppings on our sparse Brussel sprout salad, ( usually plenty of whole almonds on a normal order but got just small quantity of chopped up almonds and slivers of bacon) you know to kick it up a notch!  Rather then eating a big plate of sprouts with dressing. After spending $50.00 bucks on lunch, she promptly charged me .50 for more almonds, REALLY!  She would not comp them and demanded I pay my bill.  Elementary fast food training is needed for Diane.....",

The burgers are delectable and the prime rib is definitely cooked to order, tender and rare. Pistachio gelato is awesome and a great way to cleanse your palette after a hearty meal. Wide selection of IPA's and wines make your trip all that much sweeter. If you plan to fly out of Sky Harbor head to Chelsea's before!",

I was served promptly by a waitress with a great attitude (unexpected for an airport restaurant). I had the Brussels sprout salad that was unbelievably good! The rich toasty flavor of the Brussels sprouts was enhanced by large shavings of Parmesan cheese, and a perfect crunch of blanched almonds. Whatever vinaigrette they use is light enough to let the other tastes star. So good! Next time, I'm going for the ceviche and hope it can compare. *Forgot to note that they have a small refrigerated area where you can pick up a few things (like salads) to eat on the go, or after security. Totally worth the stop!",

She had great recommendation for the menu as well as a GREAT place to take friends and family for dinner (Chelsea's Kitchen at 40th and Camelback). What a beautiful location and setting for dinner. Her recommendation to dine on the patio was perfect. Family and friends loved it, some had heard of it, some had been wanting to try Chelsea's Kitchen and some had never heard of it, but the all LOVED it! My hats of to such a knowledgeable and efficient waitress. We don't have Chelsea's Kitchen in CO but next winter it will be one of our new FAVORITES! ThankYou Rachel!

The staff and overall service was horrible. The hostess was pre-occupied and acted bothered to seat us, and both of our servers (drink order and food order) were both very disengaged and flat out rude. It was almost as if they were inconvenienced to wait on us. No follow up during our sit down and not even a smile or \"thank you\" for stopping in. One can only hope that everybody was having a horrible morning and that this isn't the norm, because it was sad. Chelsea would have been very disappointed.   Maybe next time. :/",

The servers were kind of aggressive, but I ordered a white sangria (ok), and an omelet (EXCELLENTE!). Based on the omelet, if they do everything else on the menu as well, this place really does live up to expectations!  Only reason I didn't grade 5 stars, was because the breakfast menu was limited, and the servers (although helpful), seemed a little pushy (but efficient).",

Although I only had one thing there (the prime rib dip + au jux), it was extremely tasty and came in large portions. The waitstaff was very nice and at the end of the meal you can grab a sea salted chocolate chip cookie (not too big of a fan, honestly) and be on your way to your destination.  Sure, you'll dip a little bit deeper into your wallet, but not by much. If you're in the PHX airport and need some food, this is the place to grab a meal!",

Both the green beans and the cannoli beans were cooked perfectly. The broth in the beans was savory with a hint of lemon. The chicken itself was exactly as moist and tender as you could want from rotisserie chicken. The entire meal was delicious.  I was also surprised to see that their pretty short beer list had some really interesting choices! I really enjoyed my Belgian Karmeliet Tripel. It was quite tasty and potent. The wine list also looked small, but interesting.  I think I heard my waitress say it was her first day at Chelsea's, but if so they did a great job in bringing her in. She was perfectly attentive and knew exactly when to stop by the table. She also told me about the free chocolate chip cookies that are available on the way out.  Before tip, my lunch came to $30. Not at all cheap, but worth every penny, especially  after a week of poor business travel eating.  If you're flying any of the airlines out of Terminal 4, check your bags and grab a bite to eat at Chelsea's!",

I wanted to keep eating even though I was already full from eating the mountain of yuminess.  The lettuce is topped with their shrimp ceviche.  It's massive!  It can definitely feed two people.  It was so flavorful that I didn't even need to use the salad dressing they gave me.

I really liked how Sky Harbor has a ton of non-chain restaurants in their main food court area. A quick glance at Yelp and Chelsea's Kitchen with it's great dining room was an easy pick. The menu isn't huge, but definitely has enough options to appease a variety of diners. My selection on this flight-delayed evening was the short rib tacos. It was an easy decision to make once our dynamite waitress gave the suggestion saying it was what they were known for. We also decided to start off with chips & guacomole. I don't know if I was just famished or if it was that good, but the guac was absolutely off the charts good. My tacos were equally as tasty. The short rib was super tender, great flavor, and the homemade corn tortillas made this a 5 star meal. I wasn't crazy about the kale slaw that accompanied it, but I'm also not a big fan of kale. The person I was traveling with landed on the Green Chili burger and it looked really, really good. He housed that, I housed mine, and we were able to kill a good 90 minutes in the restaurant.  The service was incredible, the ambiance was very nice (especially for an airport), and most importantly the food was great. Next time it won't be a mandated delay, I'll get to the airport early enough to partake in another Chelsea's Kitchen meal.",

    "text": "Overall, a solid option if you're looking for a substantial sit down meal outside of of security.   The Good: -  Accessible outside of security and convenient to terminal, ticketing, and baggage areas. -  Definitely more of a legit restaurant vibe compared to most airport \"restaurants\" as it doesn't have that lingering OMG I have to rush to my plane feeling of places inside of the terminals.  -  Located right across from arrival and departure screens...always a plus!  The Bad: -  Highly inflated prices compared to those of the same dishes at their actual restaurant. Example: Ribeye Steak tacos on their airport menu are $26 compared to $21 (for lunch) and $24 (for dinner) at their brick and mortar restaurant outside of the airport. This stuff annoys me. No way am I going to pay $26 for tacos at an airport. Come on! -  Not many options if you want something light and reasonably priced. Make sure you have an appetite if you're going to eat here!  -  Watch out for the wine prices. The names and the prices don't quite line up on their menu. I asked my waitress about it and she said it confuses a lot of people.",

    "text": "I had the green chile omlette. It was almost $14 and wasn't sized properly for the price but for airport food it was pretty good. It came with a sauce but I ended up needing ketchup to make it taste better. The green chile sauce was getting overpowered by the taste of the egg itself, if that makes sense. It came with a muffin bread thingy with a weird tasting butter and jelly on the side along with a random small bowl of fruit. The coffee was good and was really needed for the time we had our breakfast. The kids menu had more stuff I liked on it. My daughter got pancakes and had fun getting syrup all over herself. Our server was great. She filled up our coffee several times. We were wide awake when we left. I would come back again next time I travel. The seating area was probably the best of any restaurant or bar in the entire airport. That alone made it worth it. It definently beats the McDonalds we normally get at airports.",

You have to get the deviled eggs! You have to get the deviled eggs! Make sure it's a large order. They were the best I ever had. I wish I knew how to make deviled eggs this good!  The tuna tartare and guacamole was out of this world as well. The fish was fresh in the guac was wonderful. Thinking back now I should've squeezed a lemon all over it. I will do that the next time I'm in Phoenix because I'm coming back and having a large order of the deviled eggs and probably the tuna and guacamole again.

The rampant stench of mediocrity is at every international airport, and I mean EVERY international airport (list: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2c4CL6X&s=efdefc285b93fae2babaefc0e4e1edd744d3fe9d02584bd5a712e624eb566c50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2c4CL6X</a>), but for some reason, Phoenix Sky Harbor has some good eateries should your Uber get you there earlier than you expected or maybe you wanted. With an hour to kill, I decided to enter this expansive restaurant in Terminal 4. I was lured in by the $14 Shredded Kale & Quinoa Salad, which turned out to be a deliciously healthy choice with sunflower seeds, grapes, chopped tomato, and shaved Parmesan, all of it drizzled with lemon juice (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2npmbl0&s=17bcc2141a7e0eb29356dac26b378bdd782b2a3452f4e15f126374ecfd369735\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2npmbl0</a>). It was just the right amount to digest before the obligatory bag of Southwest peanuts on the plane. Good food at the airport before security. Who da thunk?  FOOD - 4 stars...surprisingly flavorful salad well executed  AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...let's not get carried away, it's the airport after all SERVICE - 4 stars...like a classy restaurant in a real gourmet ghetto TOTAL - 4 stars...there's hope for airport dining and it's in Phoenix of all places",

As this is an airport venue, the breakfast options are limited but even looking over the menu, it was hard to decide. Everything looked so good!  My husband and I ended up ordering the traditional breakfast (eggs, potatoes, protein side and english muffin) and the french omelet. We also ordered bloody marys and asked for extra olives. I also asked for some light cheese over my scrambled eggs and added havarti. Because my request of extra olives and cheese (on my eggs) our server brought over some additional blue cheese stuffed olives - just cause! I thought that was very nice and unnecessary. I appreciate the little things and that wasn't something I expected.  Overall, we loved our breakfast! I'm quite picky with my eggs, especially with omelets and I was very impressed with the omelet they made. It was a good ratio of egg, protein and spinach and all the flavors went together very well.  A few things to take into consideration, this location is at an airport so the prices are quite high. However, I do believe you get what you pay for and the service was absolutely fantastic.",

They have a decent cocktail, beer and wine menu - you can also sit at the bar. Food options are on the southwest Arizona style. I've enjoyed burgers, tacos and salads here. While the tacos aren't the best around, the food is solid and very good for the airport. I also love that they have jars of cookies for after your meal, as you're leaving. Help yourself!

The salmon plate was a miss and the mashed potatoes were richish but the texture was all whip and not texture, like a salty rich goop. This was made worse by the \"seasonal\" veggie, swiss chard fried in oil and a small bit of it.  The fish was well cooked but if you're hungry look elsewhere.  The burger with Havarti is great - The Howie.  The tacos are good too. The sides are so-so but overall for an airport meal it's one of PHX better options.

And, don't judge me -- it was a long, emotionally-draining weekend, and I was in a goddamned airport, so I got the pie. The key lime pie was terrific.

I decided to have it again at the sky harbor airport today and was expecting the same great service along with the great food. Unfortunately, the hostess was horrible.  Her attitude was so horrible I decided to simply walk away. I asked a common question, 'can I sit next to the rail?' as she was setting me in a middle table. She already didn't have a pleasant demeanor about her. I must've added to her negative demeanor when I asked that question; she looked over to where I was pointing at and hesitated, then said 'No, that area is closed' and walks away...then, I look over at her and she looks at me with this disgusted look....that's when I decided to simply walk out. It wasn't si much that they didn't have that section open - I completely understand that. It was mainly her actions that made me feel very uncomfortable. Should this restaurant have a reputation management, I'd like to describe this person for the mere purpose to consider retraining her on her customer service; she had a brade hairstyle, was African American, and slender. It's unfortunate that I couldn't enjoy their awesome kale salad - especially since they don't have a Chelsea's in southern California.  About 3 hours later: I'm updating my review due to a Chelsea's representative acknowledging my experience so promptly. I've always had a enjoyable experience, and I don't want one employee to taint your great service.",

    "text": "Oh fellow yelpers, is there anything more wonderful than an unexpected food find, a bit of culinary serendipity to brighten one's day? Such was my experience when coming across this delightful eatery in none other than the Phoenix Airport Dining area, next to Sauce, another solid eatery.   I was catching a morning flight to California for the holidays and realized that Chelsea's kitchen had been put in since my last visit. I was charmed by the lights above the bar made from antique spritzer bottles and felt a little like I had stepped into an establishment in that greatest of American cities, New York.   As it was a bit early for me for lunch I ordered the oatmeal, which as far as oatmeal goes was excellent but I also ordered a cup of coffee and most glorious of surprises, they bring you a mug and a good sized french press, which you let sit for a few minutes and of course....you guessed it, press. The coffee was amazing. I asked the bartender what he thought and he agreed that it was exceptional. Best of all, between the oatmeal and the coffee the whole bill was only $8.20 and with tip, $10.50, that is a heck of good deal at the airport, not only on price, but on the exceptional quality. After reading the other reviews I'll be going back to the airport for something other than a flight and you guessed it, to eat at Chelsea's kitchen.   Note, I loved the place but I want to try a meal or two before I consider the coveted five star rank but from my initial experience, a solid 4 with 5 start possibilities.:-)",

Next, my carnitas pork roast was sliced paper thin and topped with just enough BBQ sauce to deepen the savory flavors without drenching everything.  Finally, the key lime pie at the end was sweet and refreshing.  A five up high goes out to the waitress too as she really did an excellent job throughout the meal - well-spoken, enthusiastic with recommendations and very attentive to our needs.",

I had a glass of pinot noir, which was really good, especially considering it was only $7. Foodwise, I ordered the short rib tacos, which were perfect in every way. Flavorful, tender, and it's always kind of fun to make your own little tacos. My boyfriend had the Chelsea's Burger, and I know it was amazing because he didn't offer me a single bite. Jerk.

Unless your looking to impress your fellow travelers then you definitely should think of checking out one of the other hundred establishments in the area for half the price. But the food was pretty good and get the prickly pear margarita. It's pretty amazing.",

    "text": "This is my idea of what a restaurant and meals at an airport should be like, and why can't we get more places like this elsewhere? It's got atmosphere, it's got charm (and a large part of that was the hostess who seated us) and it's got great food at reasonable (for airports) prices.   There was evidently a miscommunication after we were seated, because it took a while for our first contact by a waitress. Once that was resolved there were no more problems. We opted for a pitcher of white sangria, of which I was wary. White sangria can sometimes be really sweet - theirs was not, though I was not quite sure just how much wine was actually in the sangria mix. The dinners tasted as delicious as they looked. I will argue that for my meal, the rotisserie chicken, the side of \"colcannon potatoes\" is supposed to have cabbage in it, which was not discernible unless it was really finely chopped and cooked or pureed.   The other nice thing about Chelsea's Kitchen is that it's before TSA, so that you can visit it before going to wherever your gate is, regardless of whether it's Terminal 4 or not.",

This is an airport, your expectation and priority should be to get people in and out as quickly as possible so they can, most importantly, get to their flights on time.

Too often we pass on going here b/c don't want to risk wasting our time waiting anymore. Reservations these days are a must.   Recommendations:   Drink: Limelight is a must if you like mezcal tequila or their pitcher of sangria is wonderful for the the sugar sweeter drinker   Food: The tuna sashimi Salad is huge and beautiful but pay attention to the word spicy! They are not kidding!! (Of course I'm a baby when it comes to spice) but it has a kick that crushed me.   Tuna tacos- amazing!!!! Not spicy.   Dessert: Key-lime pie is like no where you will ever find it! Served with a huge portion of strawberry sorbet. Melts in your mouth",

It took the bartenders an incredibly long time to notice me...and once they did it took an even longer time for them to come over and take my drink order.  I waited for 10-12 minutes before anyone came to ask for my drink order.  Probably the longest I've ever waited at a pretty mid to slow bar.    Decided to wait it out though because I had nowhere else to go.  I ordered my beer and drank it and in that time the guy next to me was trying to order another beer.  He tried for probably 10 minutes and then just said, forget it and threw down some cash and left.    Servers were pleasant when they gave interest to the patrons but I can't recommend to anyone using this bar if they want any sort of timely service.  Maybe it was an off-night?  I hope this wasn't the norm.",

We ordered and waited..and waited. Our apps came before our drinks although we saw other people at the bar getting their drinks. Eventually we were given our drinks yet couldn't enjoy them since we were under a time restraint due to the waiting earlier.

I had the veggie taco with an amazing kale n quinoa salad!!  If I could have sat longer I would have finished my whole plate n them some!     Whenever you fly in or out of AZ make sure you give yourself extra time to dine here before your flight!!",

Chelsea's looked like a trendy, happening spot, so we decided to dine here and hope we'd get a flight out before midnight! I ordered the short rib tacos with a kale salad. The salad was nice and crunchy, the beef however was dry and not seasoned well. Good portion size, made four tacos. The guacamole was fresh (score!), as was the salsa. Nice, warm tortillas that our server offered to replenish if I ran out. I decided to focus on the salad since the beef was over cooked. The tortilla chips were amazing, tasted like they were seasoned with sea salt or maybe a lime/citrus flavored salt. My colleague ordered the shrimp louie salad and enjoyed it. Overall ok, would order something different if I dined at Chelsea's again.",

We even outlasted our server and had other well mannered servers complete the end of the experience. Thanks Dawn and Dawn.

I live in town so it was interesting trying to get into the airport, but in the process I got to use the new SkyTrain, which was cool. Lucky for me, I don't have to go to the airport the next time I want to dine at Chelsea's Kitchen.

Hot and crispy and nicely seasoned. The sandwich was huge and had a great sized portion of meat. I wanted horseradish and came to find out on my bill I was charged $1.50 extra for it. That was somewhat disappointing considering the price of the sandwich  $ 19. The Au jus was too greasy for my taste and rather bland and under seasoned  For a change of pace at PHX it is worth eating here before you go through security or if you have time to spare leave the gate area  Pricy but I had meal vouchers (thanks AA)  Sandwich and ice tea $24  I fly through PHX regularly and get tired of the same limited choices in the gate areas.",

Definitely has a nice, relaxing feel to it, unlike a lot of other airport restaurants I've been in. Though looking at the menu again, I was reminded of why I only thought it was ok. Don't feel like there are great options and definitely think some of the prices are too high. Got the burger with cottage cheese. Burger was not as good as I was hoping. While the Russian sauce was good, it was just not even to provide enough flavor. Cottage cheese was fine. They serve it with olive oil on top, which  now having it, wish I hadn't. Hope I remember this review next time I'm in this airport and go somewhere else.",

I opted for the key lime pie and it was excellent. Surprisingly, it had a side scoop of strawberry gelato, which was very good and had bits of strawberries in it.

Hit the accelerator, maybe add staff and convey a sense of urgency. Also, if you're going to charge $14 for a simple breakfast item, it has better be good.  Maybe lunches and dinners are better but again, diners at airports aren't there to linger. Step up the speed....",

As a frequent traveler from Phoenix Sky Harbor Terminal 4, I have found Chelsea's Kitchen to have the most consistently delicious airport food available for several years. When I fly. this is simply part of my routine, and it is far more predictable than what I might find available beyond the security checkpoints.   Granted, Phoenix Sky Harbor has added numerous restaurants, but none as satisfying as Chelsea's.  Generally, I travel in the morning, so their Classic French Omelet is my favorite. I add either applewood smoked bacon or ham. The omelet has always come out perfectly cooked, and with exactly the right balance of spinach and gruyere cheese to the eggs. Although I have had numerous breakfasts at Chelsea's, I can not bring myself to have anything different. It is THAT good.  Traveling later in the day, my fallback is the Tuna Sashimi Salad. The Del Mar salad deserves mention, but I am hooked on the Tuna Sashimi Salad.  Service has always been great. I sit at the bar, and the bar staff is very attentive. I've had excellent Bloody Marys on occasion, and their coffee is always really good.  Chelsea's has simply become how I start my travel. I have not been disappointed yet. It is a bit on the pricey side, but nothing is cheap at the airport...",

Hubby had the muesli and he was expecting the portion to be smaller, so it was very filling for him ... no biggie really.  Service was a little slow given that it was early and no one was really there, so they lost a star for that.  Nonetheless, pretty good!",

We started off with the \"homemade\" guacamole and chips, which were excellent - VERY fresh and authentic tasting.  Had to try a half-order of the Deviled Eggs and they were well worth the indulgence.  For entrees, my wife had the Green Chili Tillamook burger, while I had the Ahi Tuni Taco platter.  The burger was cooked to perfection, as was the seared tuna.  My son tried the fried chicken \"kids meal\" and ate every bite.  Equally, they had a nice selection of draft and bottled beer and spirits to choose from.  Great service from our server, Will, too!!!  All in all would \"mosdef\" will come back to this place when traveling thru PHX and would love to get down to their main restaurant in DT Phoenix!",

Not to worry, we left after 30 minutes as promised for fear of being asked to leave if we ordered a second drink. For a place that doesn't take reservations, you would think they would allow a first come, first serve patron to enjoy their beautiful patio.

The swordfish tacos Regina recommended were sublime with wood fired fish that melted in my mouth & corn tortillas still hot from their maker.

    "text": "I was so excited when I saw a Chelseas at the airport. Finally! Food and service you can count on at a terminal! Eh, not so much...while I realize its silly to think it could be consistent with the 40th St location when its at the airport, I was hopeful. Swordfish tacos were so well done we had to cut the char off. Burger was ordered medium rare, came out well. We were hoping to have another round of drinks when our food came out but the bartender never came back to ask. Stupid us, as we were finishing up we realized we were cutting it close to board time and when we were done we just wanted to pay but noone would even look our way. We finally flagged down a different bartender to get our check (why wouldn't the tab be in front of you at the bar at an airport??). We immediately took our credit card out to pay and again noone stopped to take it. Furthermore another bartender looked right at the bill with the card on top 3 times as he walked by and didn't pick it up! After 15 mins of waiting we had to go or we were in danger of missing our flight so I pulled out what cash I had (which I was saving for cab fare at our final destination) and didn't have enough for more than a 15% tip but at that point I didn't care.  Nothing is worse than being held hostage and having to wait to pay at the end of your dining experience. Securing payment is the easiest part of the job for service workers. And at the airport of all places, where everyone has somewhere to be, you would think they could close people out in a timely manner.",

It reminds me of the perfect French dips in Nor Cali that I grew up with. I generally always get that with the kale salad as a side. I've had the tacos too.. Yum. The service can go either way; I try to keep in mind it's an airport so knowing how irritated passengers can be at airports with all they are put thru to fly, I try and keep that in mind for the staff that has to deal with ... Well, often rude, stressed passengers. I have not been to the bar area, as I am generally here in uniform and wings and that is a no no. But my boyfriend has met me here and loves the sangria.

Located in PHX airport, my small group of 4 people were looking for a bite to eat at 10:20 am before our flight in 1.5 hours. The hostess was pretty disorganized due to the breakfast/lunch switchover, and it took several minutes to get seated, even though the place wasn't too busy. Once we were seated, the waitress went through her routine, finally getting to offer the soup of the day. When asked what it was, she didn't know, and had to go check for 6 minutes before coming back with \"black bean\".   We put our orders in, and waited. And waited. 35 minutes later, we were told that it shouldn't be too long, our orders did not take long to cook, they would be right out. Normally, I wouldn't mind a wait, even a 35 minute one, if someone came up and offered an explanation or reassurance that we were being looked after. Unfortunately they did not take the initiative to keep us informed, we had to reach out to them.   Mind you, this is in an airport, where a majority of patrons probably have time-sensitive needs. This caused a bit of concern with us, as we had been waiting a while and our food had not appeared yet.  Finally, our food arrived. Chicken Nachitos, Black Bean Soup, and the Short Rib Tacos. The Nachitos had generous amounts of toppings, from guacamole to jalapenos to just the right ratio of chip:cheese. Great!  I had the short rib tacos, which were amazing, although the meat was a tad dry. Healthy amount of meat, plenty of tortillas, pico de gallo, and guacamole. Also came with a side of kale salad. Not only was the quality some of the best I've had for airport food, it was one of the best short rib tacos I've ever had, anywhere. Sentiment echoed by the other people in our group.   We requested our check as soon as they brought the food and were able to make it out in time to be the last to board the plane, but without having to run. If you have plenty of time to kill, come hungry. If you are even semi-concerned about getting through security in a timely manner, you have a tough decision to make.",

It's hard to find a good burger that has flavor, juicy goodness just oozing to be partaken,  BUT Chelsea's knocked it out of the ballpark.  Had the green chili burger with Tillamook Cheddar. First Bite I was smitten, second bite put me over the moon.  First of all, they kinda had me at Tillamook Cheddar -- my all time fave cheese. Hubby and I did a cheese tasting while vacationing in Bandon,  Oregon, one year where we discovered this gem. Have sought it out ever since and Valley stores are starting to carry it. This simple fact told me Chelsea's cares about quality.  We also had the deviled eggs. Now, I am pretty fussy about deviled eggs. They have to be fresh,  nicely combined with mayo, but not overly so,  seasoned to bring out the flavor but subtle. So when these little treasures showed up on that perfect wood board, I/we were overjoyed,  these were perfect!! Next up is going to the Camelback location. ..",

    "text": "YUM!!!  My friend and I stopped in for lunch because this looked like a comfortable place, and each of us was leaving from separate terminals, so it was convenient being right in the middle.  Delicious food at reasonable prices, whether or not it's an airport restaurant.  My friend had an onion soup, which surprised her with a kick from red pepper flakes.  I enjoyed a delicious bowl of chicken tortilla soup and although it needed a pinch of salt, it was a great consistency and very good with fresh avocado chunks on top.  We shared an appetizer of some mouth-watering deviled eggs with bacon sprinkled on top... comfort food to the max!  The restaurant is lovely and very cozy; the service is very good; and the prices are a good value for airport dining.  If this restaurant had a location in Sacramento, I'd be a regular!  NOTE:  If you don't want to sit down and dine, the restaurant has a take-away counter located to the right of their restaurant entrance.  Not sure whether they sell a limited or full menu, but I'd bet it's a great option if you're short on time and want something to munch on that's satisfying to the palate.",

I have never seen such an unengaged staff wandering around a restaurant unable to figure out what to do with themselves.  (How 'bout filling up the water glass?).  Service was slow especially since there was a 1:1 ratio of staff to tables.  I had the French dip since they were out of the seafood for the salad. It was bland and needed salt at least.  Fries are tasty.  The chicken sandwich was good but spicy for my husband.  No refills on that drink to quench the spice!   Don't think we will rush back here since no one seemed to be able to crack a smile. Must have to pay extra for that.",

    "text": "Our family came to have dinner and visit with relatives during their layover at Chelsea's in Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor. It looked like a nice place to relax & visit without using up limited time driving to a restaurant.  The meals were EXCELLENT, especially for airport, and even worth the price! Taste, portions, temperature, presentation & variety, all fantastic!  Service was pretty good, except we were there toward the end of the evening, which felt like we were slightly secondary to the staff getting their closing activities done.  Little things like getting condiments out to the table right away or bussing glasses still being used... I get it, but when sweeping involves pushing chairs into yours then wet mopping the room STARTS in the walkway behind your chairs, it got a little ridiculous!  Somehow the overpowering smell of floor cleaner just negated what had been a wonderful culinary experience! Perfectly seared ahi, melt in your mouth burgers, layered pastrami, nice wine, craft beer... now a big cloud of Mr. Clean to run us out of there!  We had happily closed out our bill when asked and told we were welcome to stay and visit as long as we liked by our server. I had even called earlier for closing hours and was told they stay open until last flights.  Here's what could have happened  BEFORE dragging chairs around to sweep or slopping wet mops around the ONLY table with a family visiting at it: Just say kindly that the staff doesn't want to interrupt your group, but we're going to begin cleaning floors at the other end and you may be more comfortable moving to other seating in the airport terminal.  How nice would that have been?!!  There are many aspects to a dining experience, and the meal was so good that we had already planned to dine at the restaurant sometime soon. Just have to wait to get the taste of Mr. Clean out of my mouth!",

    "text": "This is probably the best restaurant in an airport I have yet found in the US. It's essentially a really cool fusion steak and western cuisine grill house similar to Houstons or StoneHill with a n unbelievably fresh menu.  The center bar is manned by solid bartenders who have real personalities unlike many other airport bars where androids serve you watered down drinks.  This place is legit.   On a long flight delay we had a couple delicious from scratch margaritas and the soup soup of the day (black bean with green chili). The fries are seasoned and delicious. The burger is as good as anything you would find on the best spit fire grill, and the Rotisserie Chicken is slow cooked all day in an amazing seasoning.  I can't say enough about this place. Hopefully the airport formula makes sense for them as a business because the restaurant ads more value to Sky Harbor than most of the airlines do.",

There was a wait for a table, so we put in our name and headed to the bar.  Found some nice casual seating by the bar and decided to eat there instead.    Started off with a good IPA and I ordered the French Dip, and my co-worker the Rib Eye Tacos.  Wasn't expecting anything great, but they delivered.  The French Dip and fries were delicious.  The sliced  rib eye for the  soft shell tacos looked like it was cooked perfectly and my co-worker thoroughly enjoyed it.  Overall, it was a really good meal, as I was very pleasantly surprised.  If you need a meal and have the time, I would recommend this to anyone flying in or out of Phoenix (it is almost worth going to the airport for dinner).  A bit pricey since it is at the airport, but best meal I have had at an airport by far...",

The chicken is fatty and this last time, there were only 4 little pieces of chicken in the entire salad.

First we had the poached eggs from all the pics posted on Yelp we had to try and they were the best ive ever had cool to the touch!  I had the Short Rib Tacos came with Kale Salad and wow I'm not even a fan Kale but they threw sum grapes and quinoa and it was delicious. The Short Ribs were very tender and not very greesy which is usually the problem with that meat in tacos, the guac was top notch as well   My lady had the Rib Eye steak and it brought the same sides as mine and the meat was perfectly cooked medium as she asked and was seasoned to perfection. The Rib Eye was so good they didn't do it justice having it in a taco as it can be an order by itself!  All in all its the best Airport food I've ever had hands down And They gave us a free cookie on our way out the door  COME TO NYC CHELSEA KITCHEN WE LOVE GREAT FOOD!",

Good food, good service for reasonable prices served in a relaxing environment with dim lights, darker wood, tinted windows, comfortable seats, and plenty of a/c.   I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo and chicken. I replaced the iceberg lettuce with spinach. It was delicious, especially with the mild salsa they brought out with the dish.   They made the substitution no problem.   The bartender was tending to our table. He was great, very attentive.   The prices weren't too bad, maybe $10-$15 per entree.",

They had a good sized crowd - but weren't super busy - and we were immediately sat at a table. Our waiter was on point all evening.   I decided on the ahi tuna burger and instead of fries I opted for the kale quinoa salad. It was a healthy sized 'burger' but didn't sit too heavy in my stomach which was just what I needed. The wasabi mayo added the right zing. The kale quinoa slaw was the right balance to pair with the burger. I don't tend to eat in airports too often these days, but if all the restaurants were like Chelsea's Kitchen, I would find myself there a lot more often.",

I asked the waitress about the veggie tacos and what kind of veggies it came with. She told me portobello mushrooms, peppers, onions, and a little bit of radish. My meal arrived and to my surprise, it looked like I ordered onion tacos. $18 for onion tacos? Gross. There were a few slivers of red pepper and ONE sliver of mushroom.  I asked the waitress if it was supposed to look like that and she said she would bring out more mushrooms.. which she did.. 5 more small slivers of mushroom. Let's just say I won't be ordering that again and will stick to the usual. Giving this 3 stars because my waitress was very nice and accommodating.",

You'll thank me later!  CK is located outside of the actual security / gate area, so anyone can go whether you're flying or not.  Of course, I wouldn't make a special trip to the airport to eat here, but this is one of your best bets if you do have to be at the airport.    The original Chelsea's has never steered me wrong, but I feel like you can't have expectations quite as high for second locations at airports... that is, until I came here.   Friendly hostesses, very attentive service, and food that is *almost* as fabulous as the original.  I went with an Arnold Palmer, the Del Mar Salad and a side of asparagus on my recent visit.  I received several drink refills and many visits from staff checking-in on me to make sure I had everything I needed.    I also set-up shop for a bit and worked while I was there, and didn't feel rushed at all.  Airport dining at it's finest right here... enjoy!",

He never sends his food back. After hearing my mom talk about it the entire lunch my dad subtlety mentioned it to our server as he picked up the plates. I was pleasantly surprised that he took it off the bill. He said it was not up to the standard and quality is very important. I was more than impressed. Great job at exceeding expectations. To top it off they give out complimentary cookies at the exit!!!",

The chilis weren't as tasty as other versions I've had in New Mexico. And the crispy sandwich was fairly bland despite the interesting toppings. Actually the cottage cheese was the best part, which I've never said before.",

Kale salad was pretty good size.  My friend brought up a good point- you want to share this or at least take the rest to eat later.  It's a lot of roughage for one person. Good and light dressing. The flavors went well - kale, quinoa, sunflower seeds, red bell pepper, lemon rind zest, Parmesan cheese, and grapes.  Refreshing.  Eggs were yummy but is anything not when you put bacon on it?  Good heaping amount of mixture. Not thee best I've ever had but pretty darn tasty.   Chips and guacamole are house made.  Nothing mind blowing but still good.  Salsa had a kick and roasted flavor so that is good.  Not weak.    Overall, pretty good for airport food considering I dont think highly of airport food. This did not let me down. I heard they make handmade tortillas so I gotta try their other location.",

Chris ordered the short rib tacos which I tried which were deelish and I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich.  I Love crispy chicken sandwiches and this is the best one I've had!  I was cooked perfectly and wasn't too heavy- which is hard to nail with a chicken breast.  The fries it came with were deelish too- a hint of sweet and salty- we devoured them!

I was very skeptical. I'd been up since 4 and I wasn't in the mood for something akin to the quality of Chili's To Go or even Paradise Bakery. Fortunately, I was wrong & this place was great. First of all, the staff was so so nice. Our host seated us right away and got us a highchair. He even showed us pictures of his own one-year-old (who is adorable btw). I know that having an energetic toddler in your restaurant can be irritating at best, but our servers were all very sweet and accommodating.  The food itself was great. Their menu was small but included sweet, savory, and vegetarian options. They have a few kid-friendly choices not on the menu, too. My mom and I both ordered the gruyere omelette (she added bacon and avocado to hers) and coffee. I ordered the oatmeal for my son. The coffee came out quickly in our own mini carafe. It was hot and strong and delicious. Our omelettes were tasty and came with a warm English muffin with citrus butter & some kind of jelly- maybe prickly pear? Idk but it was great. My son ate almost half of his big bowl of oats, which is impressive for him.  This restaurant is a gem- good food and great service at the airport, of all places.",

So I was hoping the food would be good. Yes, it was~! I had flown in the other morning. There was no food served on the flight. So since I was through flying I thought I would come here for a relaxing meal. I was seated right away.  Rachel was my server. She was a really nice young lady, that kept calling me Sir. She was so fast, I watched her zip all around the restaurant. All of the servers were quick on their feet here. It is decorated in a relaxing way, even a fire place going, which I liked. I was not sure what to get.  Rachel (the server) had a few suggustions, that she thought I might like. So I went with the Breakfast. It was really good. I had never had Cottage Cheese with pepper and Olive Oil. I have to tell you that it is well worth the try. Great service, Great Food. Well worth a visit here. The coffee was also really good , nice and rich with cream. You can even have a free cookie on your way out. Those were pretty good as well.",

My burger was cooked well done, too well for my liking, the toasted bun crumbled when I bit into it and all the toppings, cheddar cheese, roasted green chili and aioli made it very messy to eat. I ended up using a knife and fork. The fries were perfect! Very skinny and crispy, I could have ate a basket of those.  Our server was pleasant. We told her we didn't have a lot of time and luckily they weren't busy at that time, so our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. However, we had to ask for tea refills.  The atmosphere was nice and roomy and I was nicely greeted when I walked up to the hostess stand.  One last negative, I really wanted to order the ahi tacos, but they had just ran out and it was 2:30 in the afternoon on a Thursday, a little disappointing.",

I would go back even if it wasn't in an airport.",

Considering I am in Arizona I understand southwest cuisine, but their Bloody Mary tasted as if it was made with salsa juice. Also, the French fries were COVERED in a chili powder seasoning. Limited menu with reasonable prices.",

I was excited to find the same great food and same great service but now at the airport. My food came out quickly, and one of the managers (Charles?) thanked me for coming in. The same great service I was used to at their original location. You can tell that everyone here is on their game!!!",
