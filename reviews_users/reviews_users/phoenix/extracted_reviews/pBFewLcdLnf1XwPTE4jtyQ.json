    "text": "Updating my review;  Fate Brewing didn't blow me away on my first visit, just happened that most of their beers were big and strong. But, I gave them a few more tries and they totally won me over. I've stopped in about a dozen times now and it's becoming one of my favorite breweries to go to. On my first visit, the beers didn't do much for me, but the nice thing is that they are always coming up with new and better brews all the time. The last few times I've come in, they have had some really great pale ales, IPAs and they seem to specialize in stouts as they are some of the few I drink. The food is also amazing; they have wood-fired pizzas that are all terrific and delicious. Also, their happy hour small bites make it a go-to happy hour spot for me. The staff is also very cool, very friendly and happy to let you know about the brews going on and what to expect. So I recommend Fate for happy hour and dinner for a pizza a beer; what could be better?",

    "text": "I recently paid a visit to a cousin in Arizona for his college graduation and decided to hit up a couple of breweries during my stay. While a good number of them were pretty underwhelming, Fate Brewing Company was the best one I went to.  Fate also happens to be a brewpub, meaning that they also make food in addition to brewing beer. While the large wood-fire pizza oven they had in the back made me tempted order a slice, I decided to stick to the beers and ordered myself a tasting flight.  And boy were they some good beers. While I won't bore you with a complete rundown of the beers I had I'll mention the two standouts: the Suburnt Sour and the Shea Connection.  The Sunburt was one of the better sour beers I have had. Unlike most other sour beers, the Suburt had other flavors you can taste besides the tartness. The Shea Connection was a collaboration brew Fate did with Scottsdale Beer Company and it had a great rye flavor with just a subtle hint of oak.  The tasting room/restaurant had a nice modern feel to it with ample seating. There are TVs on the wall where you can watch whatever sports game they have playing at the time and the service was attentive and friendly.  If you ever find yourself in Scottsdale, Arizona make sure to hit up Fate Brewing Company. You won't regret it.",

The best of the best though is the Popper Pizza - it's lights out!  The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because they don't have a solid light beer. The cream ale (lightest) takes more like a pale ale with how hoppy it is. Either way I can usually find a good beer from another company on tap, but it would be perfect if they had their own solid light beer.",

Fate is a friendly place.  A cute bar, tables inside and out.  The staff was AMAZINGLY FRIENDLY and I am so glad we decided to sit up at the bar instead of a table.  Everyone in front and behind the bar helped us in our beer and food selection and they were spot on.  We had Irish Nacho's that are exactly what you would...sliced potatoes with a bunch of yummy stuff on top.  As for the beer selections, there are many, especially if you are a fan of fruity, citrus, chocolatey, sour, or wheat beers (which I am not).  But, it was still fun trying them all.  Check it out...you'll meet all the other breweries employees while you are there.",

    "text": "Fate is... well, it's okay.  Came here with some friends on a Saturday night a few weeks back. It was about 7PM and the restaurant was pretty packed. It took a few minutes for a host to come up to us and let us know it'd be a few minutes. We sat outside and it truly was less than a 10 minute wait before a table opened up. Awesome! I had worked all day and was excited (and ready) to order some appetizers.  Unfortunately, it'd be quite a while before that happened. It took at least ten minutes (probably closer to twenty) for a server to make their way to our table. When he did finally get to us, he was friendly enough. We ordered two beer flights and two sodas, the soft pretzels with beer cheese fondue, and the Irish nachos. The beer flights came out decently quickly, along with the sodas. The beers were just all right. The pale ale was pretty good - nice, light, and smooth. The beet beer divided our table, with two of us liking it and the other two (myself included) really disliking it. I chalk that up to not quality level, but more just specific taste preferences. The other beers were pretty forgettable. Not bad, but not overwhelmingly delicious either.  I had been craving a soft pretzel for weeks and Fate's did not disappoint. The pretzels were piping hot and had a great \"crust,\" with a super soft inside. The beer cheese fondue was AWESOME. Nice and hot, just the right amount of beer / cheese. I not only used it for the pretzels, but also for the Irish nachos, which were delicious but lacking a bit. With the beer cheese fondue they were pretty delicious, though!   When our appetizers came, we ordered our pizzas. It felt like there was quite a lag between when we ordered our dinners and when they ended up coming, and at this point the house had emptied out significantly. My husband and I got the veggie pizza. It was pretty good (nothing overly spectacular). He didn't like the crust (which was buttery and salty, maybe a little too thin), but I did. Our friends got the Popper pizza and liked it, but we all agreed it wasn't anything to write home about.  Overall, I was definitely expecting more. I definitely came in with a mindset of comparing it to Four Peaks Brewing, and it unfortunately did not live up to that standard - in food, beer, or service. I will probably try the new location out and give it another shot - hopefully we'll be surprised and love it next time around!",

Finally tried their candy bar milk stout and I was not disappointed one bit. Definitely worth going back for, and filling a growler. The taste is pretty spot on with the name, at first my expectations were low because of previous milk stouts that tasted decent, but this one just put all those too shame!!  The munchies came on quickly after that first sip, so had one of their staff pick wood oven baked pizzas. The variety of ingredients on the menu looked a little skeptical at first but just like their beer, after the first bite I was sold! Never had a bad time or experience there and don't see me having one there ever.",

    "text": "**EDIT**  Within hours of my original review (below), I was contacted by the owner of Fate. He apologized for my experience and offered to make it right, and for that, my opinion of this company is vastly improved. It's very refreshing to know that an owner listens to their customers and seeks to improve in areas where they may fall short. You never get a second chance to make a first impression, but the response I received from the owner is certainly a large step in the right direction.   _____________________ My girlfriend and I are HUGE beer lovers, she works at a brewery and has worked at a few different ones for the past 5+ years. We were in the Phoenix area so she could take her Cicerone exam at Crescent Crown, and we were heading up to Sedona for the next couple days. We visit breweries/brewpubs multiple times every week, and since we live in San Diego I'd like to think that we've seen a lot when it comes to the craft beer scene (I'm not trying to brag at all, just hoping to provide a context to show that we're not new to the idea/business of craft beer). We approach every new brewery with an open mind/palate, and go from there. And so it begins...   We showed on a Saturday (3/15) early afternoon to find a half-full bar and a decent amount of people at the tables, so we grabbed a couple seats at the bar. The bartender (guy with dark hair, didn't get a name) told us he'd be with us in a minute (he seemed a little frazzled), so I told him there was no rush and we started looking over the menu. A couple minutes later he comes over and asks how he can help us. I asked him if they do tasting flights (since I didn't see the option on the menu), and he *literally* rolled his eyes, let out an audible chuckle/sigh, and said yes. I was immediately pretty put off, but figured I'd let it slide since they were supposed to have good beer. I asked \"Do we build our own or is it a set number for a certain price?\", to which he replied \"Well what do you want?\" with an attitude resembling a condescending teacher talking to 5 year old.   At this point we should have left since his attitude was disgusting, but I genuinely wanted to try their beer. We ordered one flight to share and it was brought to us very quickly, which was nice. After the first taste I realized neither of us had water and we wanted a glass to cleanse the palate a little between styles. I asked the same bartender if we could each have a glass of water (a common request?), and he opens the fridge and puts down a carafe of water with two glasses, all without saying a word. I would have settled for a \"here you go\", but the silence was awkward and even more off-putting. At this point, I'm pretty much ready to pay the bill and leave; we're patronized by a worker AT A BREWERY by asking to try their beer, and we're treated rudely for having the audacity to ask for a glass of water. What's the deal with this place?  We stayed, and tried the Single Hop Sour, Hefeweizen, Table Saison, Chocolate Chili Milk Stout, and one more...can't remember (American Amber?). The beer was decent but nothing jumped out at me. I'm not a fan of hot spice/chilis in beer, but I appreciated the flavor of the chocolate against the chili in the stout. That is the only good thing I can say about this place. If I had to pick another, I'd say the parking lot was pretty clean and the pizza oven thing looked pretty cool, so thumbs up for that.   This was the 4th brewery we stopped at in Arizona (out of 6 total), and it was the only one that literally left a bad taste in my mouth. I blame the service more than the beer, but I preferred the drinks at our other stops more anyways.   We'll certainly be back in Phoenix (friends and cousins live there), but we will not return here and will not recommend this place to anyone back home.   As a tip to management, I'd recommend ensuring that your staff talk to their customers like they are adults, not children. Either that, or don't hire workers that are clearly not enjoying their job; they're damaging your brand and only making your competitors look better.",

I went with my husband and young son and we all had different pizzas and they were all great....sausage, margarita and the kids cheese. The beers were also way above par- I had the irish red and it was great! My husband tried several and found them all to be very yummy. Can't wait to go back and try the others. Our server, Alisha was awesome! She was very friendly, attentive and very sweet to my son. Great job and if you haven't tried Fate- you should!!!",

We were seated immediately and both our servers were attentive an pleasant. This place is gorgeous. Lots of different woods, a beautiful bar, and a view into their brewing room from all parts of the restaurant.  Myself and 2 of my fellow Yelpers opted for the flight +1 (all 6 of their brews featured at the time). My faves includes their Irish red (which I'm not usually a fan of), their American pale ale, and the Saison. Nice, refreshing and crisp. I was not a fan of their hefe, really not. There was a note of something I can not put my finger on that did not agree w/ my taste buds.  If you're a craft beer fan, I'd definitely recommend stopping in for a pint or flight.",

Beers ranged from good to ridiculous with some beers being the best I'd had all month. Sours, Berliners, ancho chili stouts, pilsner crisp like APAs. House beers dominate the tight tap list, only one guest tap. Sampler flights allowed at 5 at a time served in mini flute and well organized. Food is pretty much all pizza, but what we had was very good. Service was friendly and check up on us quite a bit. Outdoor patio with heat lamps is a plus. Overall, my favorite place so far in the Phoenix area and will be back!",

Typically Monday-Friday 3-6, it was a dollar off tap beers and appetizers, which is pretty much everything I would get here regardless. The menu includes pizzas for dinner options.  Monday at 5:30 was surprisingly empty - yet when we left around 6:30 place was almost packed. Maybe people don't get beers and just get pizza?  For apps my friend shared the Irish Nachos. Basically the happy marriage between loaded potato skins and nachos, this dish I think is the standout on the menu for the reason and the one we'd get every time.  Apparently the menu rotates very fast according to some Yelpers, and True enough I can't find some of the drinks I really enjoyed. I really liked the Export Stout - good hints of a coffee like flavor without too much going on. I had a Hefeweizen I really liked too but it's off the menu and I can't find the name.   I think this is a really nice place for the area, not as overwhelmed as other places like fourth peaks with decent bites and beers. With Raising Cane's across the street now, Fate North looks like it's headed towards my favorite's in North Scottsdale.",

I liked the sour beer and the IPA the most, the only one I thought was questionable was the beets flavored beer.  Then again, I'm not a fan of beets and I was not the one to order it, so I can't really say much, other than how popular it was shocked me a bit.   I really want to try the Jess pizza, which sounds amazing and com back for a few more beers. The pricing was a little high for my taste, but then again I would go to local breweries and spend 4-5 dollars on a pint.   It's not going to keep me from coming back though. Just maybe more-so after a payday. Lol",

Tried the Sizzurp on the first day of tapping and it's very good but a little sweet.  The Jess pizza is great. Cooked in a wood fired oven. Great balance of flavors.  The potato \"nachos\" are very good too but need hot sauce or red pepper flakes.  Place was hopping on a Friday night. I'll definitely be back. Kudos to Fate for upping their game - big time.",

The \"Rye so serious\" and \"Toats McOats\" were my favorite. I'd come back for these and that is what I did the second time around.   When my girlfriend and I went back with some friends and coworkers we ordered two of their pizzas. The first one we ordered was the Truff Diver and as a second option we let them make us a \"surprise pizza\".   The service was alright. It is more of a laid back type of service and very nonchalant. Everything came out pretty quickly though. Overall a great place for an after work beer and grub. I'll be coming back.",

I am not a big fan of breaded and fried food usually. McFate's is the exception for me though. The fish sandwich is amazing.

The pale ale had a great aroma and a hoppy character, but not a typical 'me-too' American ale.  Service was very attentive and friendly, though we did get a bit stranded between our salad and pizza course....  The pizza was a very nice thin-crust (not as thin as, say, Lamp's), plenty of toppings, sauce was good.  The aforementioned salad (spinach) was very tasty with a nice dressing and plenty of stuff.  My only quibble would be that a slightly larger menu would be nice -- maybe throw in a couple more topping options and a couple apps.  Focused is good, but just a little more variety would be the spice.",

It was a great start to our meal with some red sause and spicy oil to dip it in. Good for both kiids and parents.  My daughters are picky eaters but loved their in house brewed root beer and the pizza (pepperoni and  a rosemary roasted potato). They finished it off with a cake pop. Perfect.  As far as mom and dad - we enjoyed a sampler of five beers. My wife loved the cream ale and the pale ale. I thought the red and double IPA were great as well.  The smoke porter was a pleasant surprise to me. I am not a dark beer drinker but loved the taste of this beer. I can totally see drinking this along side of something lighter next time I go.  As far as food - I had the Molto Carne (pepperoni and sausage).  It had a little spice which I really liked. My wife had a salad with chicken on it. She said the meat had flavor and said she'd eat it again.  The staff was attentive and friendly.  They were knowledgable about the menu and the beer selection. I wasn't at the bar, but the bartenders seemed to have good rapport with their customers.  Bottom line - me and my family will be back to Fate.  If you like good beer, good food, and friendly people - you won't be disappointed.",

I'm more of a fruit-infused beer drinker, though, and there wasn't anything on the brew menu that catered to that. I would come back on a normal business day to try the pizza or some of the lighter beers, but a brewery with such a small variety of beers and no beer-based foods is not what I'm usually looking for in a brewery - but if you're into trying new beers, definitely check them out.

In fact I loved the ones I had. They were so unique and different.  Also their pizzas are bursting with flavor and fresh ingredients. They also have a secret oil sauce that you can put on your pizza or anything you order that kicks up the flavor. Great place I am already planning a return trip.",

The salad I had was great with blue cheese and candied pecans with sunflower seeds.  The real stand out for me is their unique beers they make and tap.  The Candy Bar Stout is just as awesome as it sounds brewed with peanuts, vanilla, and coco nibs. If you drop in to get a growler they have it on tap with nitrous and it's amazing.  The bartenders are always very friendly and willing to answer questions and fill up a growler to go. If you a re in the mood for a more standard beer check out the belgian Dubbel it's very good with everything.",

One of our members had heard about the place and the weather+patio+good brews and chews was the ideal mix. I contacted the manager to see about setting up a place for a group of about 10 people (we ended up with 15). Steve was welcoming and quick to respond. The day of I arrived early and Travis (I believe) guided me to the table, the wait staff was great and gave great recommendations. Individual checks were done without a blink and we all know that can be difficult when a group arrives at different times etc. All in all, excellent experience. The food, the brews, the homemade root beer, and the staff were great. The location just off of Scottsdale road and Shea was easy to navigate and with a back entrance by the additional parking made it even easier. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Really cute little place in a strip mall in Scottsdale.  We went in around lunch time on a Sunday.  They offer brunch and it looked like the brunch crowd was just leaving.  There was no hostess - just a sign saying to seat yourself next to a pile of menus.  We sat at the bar rather than a table.  The bartender was super friend and he approached us immediately and also gave us a menu that showed their brunch specials.  I am a big fan of bloody marys, but I am VERY pick (to say the least) about the mix used.  He mentioned that he makes it himself and let me try some. It was really good and spicy, just how I like it (I later saw him making it with sriracha).  I decided to have the bloody beer ($5) and my friend had the beermosa ($5).  Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of the bloody beer and could barely drink half of it.  Also, they only had a few of their beers on tap.  The bartender mentioned that their brewer has been out of town and would be back soon.  I only tried one of the beers (other than that in my bloody beer) and I wasn't impressed.  I would have to try a lot more to make a real opinion about their brewing operations.  They do offer other beers on tap as well.  They offer pizza and have a cool little kitchen area with a brick oven.  We wanted something sweet and were told that they could make something called a \"sweetie pie,\" which was pizza crust brushed with cinnamon and brown sugar, topped with a raspberry compote and topped with a vanilla mascarpone cream.  It was really good!  This place was actually really far out of the way for us, so I am not sure I'll be back.  But if I am in the area, I will stop in and check what they have on tap.",

    "text": "It was my 2nd time back at Fate's, 1st time I really didn't have anything but a glass of water, being DD and all, so I didn't think it warranted a review.   This time I was with a group of friends, we met up for a Hike and Brew, and Fate Brewing was the placed picked for the brew part of the day.  Our server was Fausto, he was great! Told him I had to be the party pooper of the group and order fast & leave soon, but he didn't miss a beat, took my order and got me my drink!   Still being new to ordering beers (the number of beers I have drank in my lifetime can be counted on one hand) I checked out the list of beers and went with the Irish Red,  it's a cooper red malted focused with an initial caramel sweetness & roasted dryness in the finish. Now the way I happened upon my 1st beer, which was a stout, someone said they are like coffee, I like coffee, ok I love coffee, so it has to be good right? So this Irish Red said caramel sweetness, yes I like that too, so that's how I picked Irish Red, and I have to say I was pretty happy with my choice. Very good, can't wait to try it again!  I was a little bit hungry, but not enough for an meal, so I ordered off the starter menu and got the Potato Nachos, now in the past when I have ordered potato nachos I always regret doing it because I like thick slices of potatoes covered in cheese and goodness not the paper thin slices, I'm a potato luv fool!  But this time I was not disappointed, it was potato slices, but not thin, but not too thick just perfectly right, covered in mozzarella cheese, topped with BACON, red onions, roasted garlic sour cream & chives. This plate of nachos was out of sight! Before I knew it, I ate it all! So dang good!  Glad to have made it back to Fate's and actually tried some beer & food this time :) Look forward to coming back!",

There used to be life around here back in the days when Devil's Martini existed.  Still some small hot spots here and there; the there is Fate.  The only beer brewing restaurant around; this cute little brewery spices up the night life back into the area.  I shared the olive side and a capicola pizza with a pal.  If you like olives this was a delight.  Nicely dripping in it's own juice with a salty punch to your palates.  The firewood pizza that we ordered was okay I thought.  The crust got dried out quickly and the toppings did the same.  Kept on drinking to finish it off!    Drinking was not what I did here though.  I'm not a big fan of craft beers, but can appreciate it.  We sampled all their beers and my favorite and also strongest was the Belgo American Tripel.  Strong indeed cause I started to buzz a little after one!  Light weight here!  Anyways, the other beer were strong also and extra bitter to me.  Almost like an IPA which I despise!  All you IPA drinkers can hate...go ahead.    Overall, the atmosphere is great and the service was awesome.  Drinks were fine, but not my cup of tea and the food was okay. - Enjoy!",

Their beer is good, and the food is excellent. Wood fired pizzas, roasted nuts and olives, spinach queso, There are two locations and this particular has a limited menu due to the size of the kitchen. The pizza is a staple when we visit this one if we are eating. Love the Pablo Honey (capicola ham, habanero honey, garlic oil) and the hot sausage (fennel sausage, red pepper harissa, goat cheese). At the other location, we favor the Maui chicken salad (orange, pineapple, strawberries, pecans, feta), roasted garlic burger (swiss cheese mushroom burger), and street tacos (pork delish). The only thing we weren't thrilled with was their fish and chips.  The Irish Red, Coffee Milk Stout, Pueblo Vienna Lager and some of the staples we can't live without. There are always great seasonal choices and they have had some good saisons and sours. As usual, I can't speak to the high IBU hoppy stuff, but friends say the IPA is one of the best they can find anywhere.",

Single Hop Sour(cascade)- Not super sour like sours can be, the cascade hops with the citrusy flavor was a good balance. You do get that hint of  salivating sour feeling while you sip. Really good  Totes McOats- Was hoping for a little bit more IBUs out of this Pale ale. A little bit on the light side but still was enjoying when i was sipping this away. My taste buds enjoyed this one   American Pale ale- Really good balance of Hops in this West-Coast Pale ale. at 6.0abv and 66ibus- i was likeing this   Rye So Serious- Now my favorite out of the 5. the RED IPA, Coming in at 70IBUs, i saved this one for last. If you like IPAs, get a pint of this. doesn't disappoint. Taste it for yourself.   I enjoyed this brewery and liked the decor/ambiance. If this was in San Diego, i would definitely visit this place frequently. Next time my fiancee and i are in scottsdale, this will be the first stop. Ill be wearing my FATE brewing shirt too!  Keep it up FATE- Hopefully you get your beer distributed to San Diego, i would definately buy.",

In fact, they only had four Fate beers available and they were only filling jugs with the Sour IPA (which is nasty).  What's the difference if I sat at the bar and had two glasses of Honey Double IPA or filled my growlette with the same amount?  I wasted 40 minutes of driving.  There's a new brewery opening up the street soon.  I doubt I'll be going back to Fate anytime soon.",

The staff was very friendly and helpful. The decor is modern - a bit of the industrial look with a lot of concrete and wood, but it managed to feel warm, not sterile. They have a wood fired oven and offer a variety of pizzas. I tried the margherita and it was perfect to share as an appetizer/light meal. It was a thin crust and the ingredients were very fresh. They have a wine list with regional wines and brew about 5 of their own beers. Most of their beers were described as hoppy, which I'm not a huge fan of, but the cream ale I got was pretty good (a little bitter for me, but I think beer connoisseurs would appreciate it). They also feature other regional brews. Overall, I think this will be a great little classy hangout spot!",

I had the oatmeal stout and he had the IPA, and we were both pleased. There were quite a few beers on the list that they didn't have on tap, which was disappointing, but it gives us more incentive to go back!

I believe our waiter's name was AJ and he was very helpful and friendly.  We started out with a Lumberjack Rasberry (which was on a special draft) and their Hef.  Uh-Maz-Ing for both.

But then most of the time now we're set on going to our other places, so we don't make the special effort to go to Fate at all when they happen to be open.  Decisions to close like this probably impact a lot of customers because the way you find out is usually by the frustrating experience of showing up for a pint thirsty, hungry, etc. and seeing the sign.  On top of that, some of us sort of forgave them but then honestly forgot about the restricted hours and so we showed up at lunch and got the closed sign again.  We can't be alone in having this happen.*  Flavorful ales can be found here in Scottsdale on Shea, just a bit east of Scottsdale road on the south side of the road.  Cream Ale, Pale Ale, Smoked Porter, Brown Ale - I tried them all and appreciated the pronounced hop influence, especially in the pale ale.  Stunning bar and brewery atmosphere with a modern, high-end feel to it all.  Indoor and outdoor patio seating available.  They might be a victim of their own success though because I can see it filling up quite fast during prime hours.  Wood fired pizzas made in your sight at the back and mine was very good.  Perfect size for a really hungry person or two people to share if they're going to have salads first.  Salads looked tasty but didn't try.    Staff was incredibly polite and professional, which is something sorely missing in the service industry these days.  They were quick to answer questions about the beers and offered some helpful literature on their house brews.    Guest taps are available if your tastes lean somewhere else.  Mongo IPA, Scrimshaw Pils, Bruery Mischief, among others were noted.    Limited parking in the front facing Shea, but more parking is available in the back.  Looks like dinner hours only (for now).",

House beer list seems long but on closer examination doesn't have much variety; out of about ten there are two stouts, two reds, and lots of IPAs. Sorry, but IPAs are a dime a dozen these days, the fallback when a brewer can't think of something more imaginative. The only thing that stood out was an apricot beer that was okay, but too hoppy. The session beer was not good, poor balance - way too hoppy and no malt character at all.  The menu is trendy, full of olives and feta and all things hip and now. We had the potato nachos, which were very light on cheese, meat or anything but potatoes. I had a pizza, not impressed at all but I felt very healthy and cool eating arugula and mushrooms on a dry, cardboard crust. My companion had a salad which was average.  Service was slow and mechanical, the bartenders had friends at the bar who required the vast majority of their attention.",

    "text": "I spent the week of Thanksgiving in Phoenix visiting family, so naturally I wanted to try some of the new craft beers being produced in Phoenix.  I moved away from Arizona in 2005 and at that time the craft beer scene was as dry as [insert name of any wash/creek/stream in the Phoenix area here].  I currently live in one of the better known small town craft beer havens, and I routinely visit one of the others up north, so I've become a little bit spoiled when it comes to good beer.  I will not name the other local brewers that I tried prior to visiting Fate, but I won't hesitate to say that I was becoming very disappointed in what Phoenix had to offer in the way of craft beer.  Unoriginal, uninspired, overly hopped IPAs; unoriginal, uninspired, flat pale ales; and drab, flavorless Hefes everywhere.  I had one of the worst Ambers I've ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.  I tried quite a few on draft, some from bottles, and some from cans...all less than impressive.  I had read good things about Fate and as fate would have it (see what I did there?), the last night of my trip allowed me, my sexy beer nerd fiancee, and my sister to make a trip to the brewery.  Fate completely crushed every other brewer I tried while in town.  I started with a flight (Irish Red, Oatmeal Pale, Oatmeal Double IPA, Candy Bar Milk Stout, and a barrel aged double stout), all of them were flavorful, well-crafted, and easy to drink.  I went with a full pour of the Oatmeal Pale, it was that good.  I drank it while eating my delicious wood-fired pizza, it complimented perfectly.  For dessert, I went with a full pour of the barrel aged double stout.  It was definitely the winner of the night for me; aromatic, full-bodied, perfect balance of roast and sweet with just enough of a whiskey kick at the end to prove it was barrel aged.  It was surprisingly smooth for the high ABV.    Bottom line, if you truly love beer that is well made, tastes like it should, and won't leave you wishing you had just ordered a water and saved the $5-6, you must go to Fate.  They clearly know what they are doing and are producing the best beer I had while visiting the Valley.",

    "text": "We stopped by Fate Brewing for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner and weren't surprised to find it quite busy.  We put our names on the list to wait for a table.  While we waited, we enjoyed a beer on the patio.  Unfortunately, there was little space between the outdoor seating and the high top counter surrounding the patio.  We had enough room to stand and drink our beers but felt that we were intruding on other patrons dining experience.  I'd love to see a little reorganization on the patio to make the counter area more usable, perhaps even some bar stools.    We were seated, brought menus and a cute little jug of water for the table.  We looked over the menu and decided on the house salad, Rustica pizza and a Capicola pizza.  We also enjoyed a flight of the four Fate brews available.    All in all the food was great.  The salad was fresh, the pizzas were unique, delicious and cooked to perfection.  We thoroughly enjoyed the beers.  I loved the Pale Ale and my husband would have sipped on Smoked Porter all night long.  Next to the host stand, there is a cooler housing some of the best cake pops I have ever eaten.  They were more like cookie dough pops than cake pops, if you ask me, but they were amazing!  Snickerdoodle was killer!  There were a few issues with the attentiveness of the servers when it was busy, and our servers menu knowledge was iffy.  Serious five star potential, for the next visit, but until they work out a few minor kinks, I'm sticking with a solid four star rating.",

Waiter told us that they keep the beer selection pretty fresh - coming up with new ideas all the time.  20 minute wait on Thursday night was OK.  Staff was friendly.

It definitely has a low-key vibe, and the brick oven always adds a nice warmth and is a visual plus.   Cleanliness: A  Easy. Not much to complain about here. Nice and clean.  Service: B+  We've been to McFate's Tap & Barrel a few times before, and service has always been awesome. This particular experience didn't match our previous visits unfortunately. It wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. Not memorable at all. Our server was a girl who didn't even bother mentioning her name, and also didn't smile once. I work in the F&B industry as a manager myself - most of my job is literally to smile and ensure people feel welcome and comfortable. Smiling is always something that should happen during a dining/drinking experience. Just didn't happen this time. On another note, she was able to snag us a few leftover gingerbread man cookies from last night's event! That was a nice touch :)  Food: B+  Food is solid. \"The Jess\" is a killer combo of pizza ingredients, and the pizzas are cooked well in their brick oven. In a previous visit, I also tried the Caesar Verde - a caesar salad with some pesto added to it - and it was super tasty. I like how simple they keep their food menu. It's a great way to keep customers happy (and full) while being able to relax and enjoy the True star... the BEER!  Beer: A  My first time going to McFate's I actually wasn't too impressed with the beer. I did a flight of a few random ones, and they were just OK. But then...  Then I stopped by once and got the Candy Bar Milk Stout.   And it changed everything.   I'm a huge fan of all things dark beer, and the Candy Bar Milk Stout is absolutely outstanding. Perfectly sweet, with salty, nutty and chocolate notes. It just doesn't get much better. One of my favorite sweet stouts is White Russian Stout by SunUp, and the Candy Bar Milk Stout is right up there with it. Totally killer.   Sorry - I guess I kind of got off-top for this particular visit. Because the Candy Bar Milk Stout is no longer being brewed right now, I went with the gingerbread stout (one of my servers told me earlier today how fantastic it was, so choosing it was a no-brainer). The gingerbread stout was definitely a good stout, especially for the holidays. In my book it's not quite as tasty as the almighty Candy Bar Milk Stout, but again - still a solid beer for sure.   Creativity: B+  The only way I give an establishment an \"A\" for creativity is if they do something totally crazy, and that's not McFate's. They are solid all the way around, and while their seasonal beers are definitely unique and delicious - they aren't anything completely nuts. Which honestly, can sometimes be a good thing. McFate's is consistent and dependable.",

Service was a bit slow and when our friend wanted to take a pizza to go - something she asked about when she ordered her dinner - she was told that there was no dough thawed and she'd need to wait another 20-minutes.  Not a huge deal, but this is the 2nd odd thing (pizza's not made right a few weeks ago) that has happened at our favorite local pizza and beer place since the new GM came in.  We will keep coming in because the beer is amazing and we like the food and the vibe. This is merely a quality check....",

The beer is obviously the main attraction and I'm a huge (yuuuuge) fan of their Fateful IPA (6.6% ABV 85 IBU) and their Hibiscus Pale (5.4% ABV 40 IBU). The bar staff is always more than willing to help you choose something perfect for you and even recommends mixing certain beers to create something magical!   I've had a few of their pizzas, but the best is by far the Sticky Fingers with garlic oil, mozzarella, Serrano ham, arugula, and habanero honey drizzle. The habanero is just spicy enough without being overwhelming and the honey provides the sweet balance. Service has always been fast and friendly. I'll continue to come back!",

    "text": "Love this place. Stopped in after an event at the senior dog rescue with another volunteer because Yelp brings them up on the \"Bloody Mary\" list. Our waiter, Fausto, looks as us dismayed because it's Saturday and they are closed Easter. They normally make Bloody Mary's on Sunday and because they will be closed, they did not get any mix. He then goes on a hunt and finds just enough mix to make one drink.   I happily order a mimosa, my friend orders her one Bloody Mary and we survey they menu while we sit on the patio. The menu looks amazing. Our server is swamped with tables, so by the time he gets back we've decided on a pizza. His suggestions are The Jess or the Con Carne. I don't eat meat so I ask if we can do the Jess without bacon. He suggests half bacon so my friend can have it on hers. Great suggestion so she can still enjoy the full combination.   We replenish with another round of drinks, mimosas, he keeps the water coming and our pizza arrives. It has baby spinach, ricotta, huge chunks of  sauteed garlic, cheese and bacon on her half. The crust is crispy through and through, no sog anywhere. It was phenomenal.   After our food, we ask Fausto if they have a dog friendly patio (of course we want to know if we can bring some of the senior dogs over with 'Adopt Me' vests on to relax while we eat and get them out and about). He says absolutely, gives us his name, his managers name, and is absolutely awesome.  Overall we had an amazing meal, a great server, and we will definitely be back and would recommend.",

Terry has moved on, but he was one great ex-dreadlocked barkeep. I think it was that he had to get married and get serious with life. Fausto, Travis and Summer are great, they remember who you are, they check back with you regularly, and they remember what you like.  It's the follow-through when you're delivering an order, whether it's a single customer or a gaggle, a single beer or a feast, it's important to meet the customers' eyes when the product is delivered. There's nothing worse than having the employee set the order down but be talking or concentrating on someone else at that moment. Without that moment of connection, the delivery seems like an afterthought. I've rarely had to be on the other side of the transaction, so all i can say is I appreciate the demands on the employee, but as a customer, that' moment of connection makes me believe that the server knows that I'm there. The crowd gets bigger as the week moves on. Mondays and Tuesdays are quiet, even into Happy Hour. And by the way, the Happy Hour deals are good. Fate's my neighborhood brewery, I appreciate the work of McFate and his team for their entrepreneurial and beer-making skills and passion!",

They could offer sharper knives for cutting the pizza.  That would be my only suggestion.  They have indoor and outdoor seating with a great concrete bar and 2 TV's with the sound off.  A \"garage door\" joins the inside and outside areas together.  My favorite beer selections are the Irish Red and the American Pale Ale.  Both are excellent.  Also anything with Hatch Chili's is pretty good as well.  Fausto is a great server.  If you are lucky enough to get him you will be well taken care of.

On the one hand, the service was quite good and the place had a nice vibe to it, almost a buzz.  The restaurant is fairly open air and even though we were sat inside, we were close enough to the patio to enjoy this aspect.  In addition, I thought that the food was top notch for a small brewery.  They only have salads and pizza, but both the house salad and the Sunny Side pizza we tried were both interesting and flavorful.  The salad had a great mix of textures and was topped with just the right amount of dressing.    Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the beers and feel that most of the other breweries in town and down the way in Tucson are better.  Their selection was small but not miniscule, as they had five of their own brews on tap and another handful of guest brews.  Neither my wife or I like hoppy, bitter beers-which I find that many smaller breweries tend to focus on-so this immediately cut out selection down to about half.  We sampled their hefeweizen, which we both agreed was underwhelming, as well as one of the light rotator beers that turned out to be nearly flavorless.  Feeling that the American brown would be a fairly safe choice at 36BTUs, I went for a pint of this.  Unfortunately I didn't care for this either, as it was far more bitter than expected and frankly just not that good in my opinion.    Overall I'd still recommend trying this place, given the quality of the food.  I was mainly disappointed in that it seems to appeal to a narrower group of beer drinkers, but at the same time, I can't dock it too much for this as I'm sure many will find their beers to be appealing.  If anyone has been to Borderlands Brewing in Tucson, I think this would be an apt comparison; personally I can't stand any of their beers but I know a lot of people who love it there.",

Their smoked porter is one of the best beers I have had in months. Their IPA is pretty great, too. I had the chance to try some of their beers at a beer festival and they were a highlight of our time at said festival.   They also have wood-fired pizza here. I have had a few different pizzas, and their pizza bread is amazing. Oh, and the dipping sauce. I have no idea what it is, but it is AMAZING! I pretty much want to take a bath in it. So good.   Fate is in a great location, too. Really excited that a new brewery has opened and they are producing good beer. And how could I forget... CAKE POPS! Yes, they serve cake pops. This place just keeps getting better. If you like good pizza and great beer, check out Fate Brewing Company. You won't be disappointed. When you are there, ask if the owner is there. He's a great guy and likes talking to fellow craft beer enthusiasts. Bottoms up, people!",

I don't recall having a beer really stand out for me, seemed like they were all good, but the imperial ipa wasn't what i hoped it would be. By all, i think they only had 3 of theirs available.

The presentation of the beer menu is a tease here, as they list off all the beers they brew, leaving you salivating, before you realize that only three of them are currently available.  On our visit, two were IPAs, which seemed redundant with such a small selection.  Then I realized they had a couple of other beers which were not on the menu (5 or 6 total, plus some \"guest\" beers from other breweries) and I felt less confined.  All the beers we had were very good, and not weak.  They give you stats (alcohol content, IBUs, etc) to help you pick.  I could see coming back every so often just to check out what's new on tap.  We also had pizza bread, which was basically a medium cheese pizza.  It was exactly what the mid-afternoon happy hour called for.  Speaking of happy hour, we had four beers and that pizza for $18, which is kind of a ridiculous deal.    I love checking out local breweries when I'm visiting a city, and this place exemplifies why.",

Fausto, our server, was a delight - attentive, knowledgeable and prompt in every way.  We enjoyed our meal - the margherita pizza was excellent with shredded basil over the entire surface, and the Red Irish Ale was a delight.  The unexpected bonus was their guest brew from Funkwerks in Fort Collins, CO, which was their King Tropic brew.  We had this at Funkwerks taproom in July, 2013, and it was superb, 8.2 ABV, and full of flavor.  It is worth the trip just for this beer alone, but that discounts Fate's Oatmeal Stout - a grand stout full of flavor and delicious from start to finish.  This is a new micro-brewery celebrating their one year anniversary.  Join them and enjoy every bite and every brew!",

    "text": "Finally made it to Fate. Don't always find myself up here, but after recent visits to N. MTN Microbrewery & SunUp I was damn well excited to be walking in. At the bar we tasted a sample of the Single Hop Sour which made my socks roll up and down - twice. Wow. Nice effervescence as well. A sample of the Irish Red - solid.  A sample of the Cream Ale came with an eye roll and recommendation to order the flight. I'm sharing the samples with my wife, mind you. No worries, we are humble people, and he did provide the Cream Ale, which was lovely. But I really really wanted a sample of the Am. Pale Ale. We huddled and hatched a bold plan - go with a 50/50 mixed pint of the Sour with the Am. Pale. We were counting on the Pale to be as awesome as the Sour, and also subdue it some, so my socks only rolled up & down once. Of course the real brilliance was that we didn't need to upset Donny Darko for another sample. Well DD wasn't impressed. He lowered his head as if in pain as he poured. I tried to brighten him up - 'you must get this request often, huh?' Sloooow painful shake of the head. 'Never'. Well buckle my chin strap if this wasn't a delightfully beautiful collision of deliciousness (and, truth be told, DD made it a 70/30 mix - no worries incentive to come back and experiment). I may never be forgiven by the Beer Gods of Etiquette (or the bartender) for my reckless behavior, but my taste buds keep asking me to go back. Hats off the the brewmaster. Fine selection indeed.",

I told the waiter what I was after (not yeasty or bitter, not too strong and a little sweet) He was so patient and brought out a couple of samples.  I loved the hefeweizen and ordered a pint of that.  My boyfriend got their home made root beer which was AMAZING (brought back memories of childhood).    The waiter was knowledgeable and answered all our questions about the menu.  We decided on pizza and a salad.  The house salad was phenomenal.  Such fresh ingredients with a light dressing and the most wonderful mixture of crunchy and slightly spicy nuts.  I could make a meal out of it and, next time I might!  For our pizza, we got half pepperoni and half fennel sausage.  Both were excellent.  We each liked our own half a bit better so it worked out great.  You HAVE to save room for these little \"cake pops.  They are lollipops that are like a cake/cookie batter with a hard coating on the outside.  They come in many flavors - snickerdoodle, mocha, peppermint red velvet, gingerbread, chocolate coconut.  We got snickerdoodle and mocha and they were both excellent.  The perfect amount for dessert when you are full but still want something sweet.    They have only been open a week and are still working out a few bumps (the server disappeared a couple of times when we were looking for him) but overall, this was a fabulous experience.  How wonderful to have an independently owned little place like this right in our back yard.  We will definitely be back.",

Little did I know one was hiding just down Shea Blvd. at McFates! Fantastic and made my day. They also had reasonably priced scotch for my wife. We had some food that was also very good. The place is easy to miss as it doesn't have much curb appeal but once inside its very comfortable and friendly. Have since been to the south Scottsdale location and had a good experience. Keep it up!",

I had a couple friends who used to work there recommend it to me and if I could go back every day to eat their food and drink their yummy beer (without becoming an alcoholic haha), I would!   Ordered the Oatmeal Crisp which was perfect for the time of year. Light and crisp (as the name suggests). For food, we got the Sow Sweet...... this is TO DIE FOR.  It's a white sauce pizza with prosciutto, fig jam, apples and goat cheese - holy mouth watering goodness! I was so full but I wanted to eat more and then order another to go (sadly I did not).   The staff there was very helpful and never overbearing. The space is smaller but I don't mind that. There's plenty of seating for bigger groups as well even though the space may not be as big as some of the big box restaurants.   Love love love this place!",

If it was revolutionary, you would see a worldwide reversal in trends from, say, German purity law beers, to chili beer. Aint gonna happen. Beer is good because it tastes like.... beer. Not chili. Not cherries. Not Grapefruit. Sure they make an interesting brew for those who might like to venture outside the boundaries, but they will never replace a conventional beer, whether it be an IPA, stout, or ale. Long story short, plop a Six Killer Stout down next to your chili beer and I guarantee 99% of beer drinkers will go for the former. And with this crazy trend of microbreweries popping up like so many Starbucks, the Beer Awards lists change like underwear.",

Whether traveling through Scottsdale or a resident of the valley, you have to put this on your things to do list of places to visit while in Arizona! The staff is so friendly and when you're here you feel like you're treated like family. Chef Zach heads the kitchen and does a fabulous job whipping up food sure to please the senses. You will likely see his presence flowing through the Tap house with a big smile engaging the guests. He was kind enough to create a dish for me from scratch and that says everything about a Chef! Lastly, be sure to ask for Ryan, one of many knowledgeable bartenders. He is so personable and will take you on a tour through their beers, from the Mcmosa Sour Ale, which its aroma is that of a Bloody Mary cocktail and taste even more diverse and delicious on the palate, to their DBL. Dry Hopped IPA's called, Fatality. This place is a Gem, so if you find this review helpful and decide to visit their location off of Scottsdale and Shea Blvd, be sure to tell them Sebastian says hello ;)",

If you order breakfast pizza (they add egg to pizza and call it breakfast pizza), two 5 oz beer is included. I picked two of the last one on the list. Stout and Irish something.

McFate's specializes in wood-fired pizza and small batch beers with fun names like \"Oh My Gatos!\", \"Totes McOats\" and \"Fate-Ality\". Not a very large spot to hang out so expect the possibility of a little bit of a wait, but the servers were relatively attentive despite being ultra, mega, super busy.   Personally, I'm a cider gal so I was happy to see that they offer Ciderboys Strawberry Magic in bottles. Which if you have never sampled before, Strawberry Magic smells like a daydream of skipping through fields of strawberries and sunshine (and tastes equally as wonderful)!!  We tried a pizza with half, Truff N Stuff - olive oil, mozzarella, red onion, arugula, shaved parmesan, and lemon truffle vinaigrette and half, The Jess - cheese, baby spinach, bacon, roasted garlic. While Truff N Stuff was good, The Jess was definitely the standout and full of flavor. Yum!  Really pleased with this visit and can't wait to try McFate's - South sometime as well!",

    "text": "This is one of the best craft beer tap rooms I have ever been to, if not the best. McFate is an institution in the Arizona craft beer community.   For context, I started going to McFate (Fate back in the day) nearly three years ago. This neighborhood craft beer pub features excellent as well, the Jess being my personal favorite.   Moving to the beer now... the beer is incredible, all their beers, but their IPAs belong to a different class altogether. Flip the menu to the back, to find the heavier, hoppier, bigger beer selections. Some of the crows favorites are: American Pale Ale, Fatality IPA, Double Oatmeal IPA (a photo of a double oatmeal IPA in my review). Last year (2016) they started brewing an American Pale Lager (APL) which is probably among my too 5 beers ever.   This small pub is where they started their operations in Arizona, and they used to brew their beer here. Two dads ago (late 2015) they opened a gorgeous facility south of Old Town Scottsdale, on Scottsdale road, where they do the brewing now. I strongly recommend you to visit that facility.   Finally, but maybe most importantly, their staff is wonderful across both locations. They're very friendly, very casual and down to earth. One of my favorite breweries in Toronto has staff that is not really friendly and that ruins the experience for you (Bellwood Brewery), so every time I'm back at McFate I really appreciate how friendly the staff is. Special mention to Fausto as his location, who is one of those friendly faces that is always up for a good chat and solid beer recommendation.   Keep it up guys!",

    "text": "We started out really excited to go to this place, but left feeling sort of deflated about the customer service.   The decor looked great, background music was a nice indie blend and the place was clean.  When I asked our waitress about the beer selection and that I primarily prefer belgian and wheat ales, she said she couldn't really help me because she only liked hoppy beers since she started working there. She didn't tell me about any of the guest ales on tap (there was an Orange Blossom) or to even help to explain about any of the house beers that would have a low IBU (International Bitterness Units). So I ordered the house root beer. Not bad.  We ordered a pizza for dinner and it was pretty good, but then we waited and waited for the waitress to come around and ask us if we wanted dessert (we did), but she brought us the check (on a slow night with about 12 people in the restaurant) and left before we could even ask her about the desserts. My husband had to go over to the dessert case to get the owner to order our dessert for us. And the tiramisu was really lacking.  Bottom line: For a brewery/restaurant that has been open for more than a few months, I expect better service and consistency than this. Get it together.  Parent Perspective: Two high chairs available (that I saw), two items for the kids' menu and no changing table in the bathroom.",

My husband and I generally prefer pale ales so we ordered the Single Pale Ale and American Pale Ale. Both were awesome! We had sampled some pale ales at Arizona Wilderness the night before and I preferred the beers at Fate. I would even say that Fate  could easily become my favorite local brew. Looking forward to coming back for the Double Oatmeal IPA.  Food was impressive as well and prices were very reasonable. Menu consists of pizzas, salads, and apps. It was hard to choose a pizza because they all sounded great, some interesting ingredient combos too. Our server recommended the fennel sausage and it didn't disappoint. The sausage had great flavor and loved the pairing with goat cheese!!",

I can't comment on the food because I was on a strict liquid bread diet when I came in. But their wood-fired pizzas look good....next time.  I ordered a flight that kept my occupied for a while. I think my favorite was the American Pale Ale, believe it or not. but I also really enjoyed their Irish Red. I also followed this by the Grand Canyon Pils which I thoroughly enjoyed as well.  They have a nice bar area and the servers are great. You can really tell that they are beer enthusiasts themselves and that makes the experience enjoyable. I recommend this place highly if you want to have a beer or two in a friendly, relaxed environment.",

We show up and a notice on the door says the kitchen is closed due to their refrigerators being broken. Bummer and unfortunate for them. I had come on an empty stomach, planning to eat and drink. Now I'm in a bit of trouble. Luckily my boyfriend had eaten and could drive home. We asked if we could get se food and bring it in since they couldn't serve and we were drinking after all. The answer was a stern no with a bunch of BS added to it. You would think the liability of serving people without food would override having others food in your establishment. Guess not.   Then there were three guys at the end of the bar. They were three of five in the place. You would think they were hard of hearing the way they were practically yelling at each other to have a conversation. Annoying. We took out tasting flights and moved to a table.   Another couple came in and were so annoyed by the loud patrons they asked that the music be turned up to drown them out.   Overalls not a welcoming experience. Trying to take into account what is their fault and what isn't but the customer service was no bueno and that goes a long way.   Maybe we'll try it again some time...maybe.",

Everything from the ambiance, food, happy hour, beer, and even cake pops were simply amazing!!,  I'll start with my favorite, beer. We got here early during happy hour and thought that my wife and I would order 2 beers each. So I ordered the Smoked Porter and she had Imperial IPA. Trying these I would say the imperial IPA was really good. 8.5 100lbu. Very tasty! The smoked porter was great too. Not really my thing but with food it tasted good. A little on the over smoked flavor but I respect that. After we had the pale ale and Irish Red. The pale ale was 6.0 and it was more on par of average IPA.  The Irish Red was amazing! A strong but refreshing red. This was my wife's favorite beer. Mine has to be the imperial IPA.   During HH we ordered the pizza bread very good. Basically cheese bread on their pizza dough. It came with a side of marinara. I would total order it again next time we are at HH  We then decided to order a pizza to share. We chose the rustic pizza which including artichoke hearts, fennel,sausage, gorgonzola cheese. I thought it was excellent pizza! Even better with a craft beer next to you.   Anyways our experience at Fate was excellent. Id like to add that the service was excellent and liked the layout of the restaurant and the small brew tanks. This place is small but seems like a lot of room at the bar and a decent sized patio.    Oh one more thing, when we were walking out, my wife spotted the cake pop display. We had to turn around and ordered 2! 2 bucks each and well worth it!! We tried the sinker doodle and peppermint red velvet. The red velvet was the best! A little harder shell but once you ate more they were very moist. Do your self a favor and order at least one on your way out!!",

My brother and husband choose the McFate Fatality, OMG a beer I can get behind. Smooth, sweet and none of that bitter taste that has always thrown me off from beer. It did take a while for food, but the staff was gracious and more than apologetic. Ultimately the food was worth it! Habanero honey wings were on point, Lunchbox burger was amazing, seriously, PB and J on a bacon cheeseburger is... I am speechless! My husband said the chicken tacos were good.

    "text": "I know the name is deceptive. On maps is says McFate. On Yelp its called Fate top + barrel. They could call it whatever they want for all I care. Junk brewery. Confused Brewery. I'd still keep coming. If you're wondering, I call it Fate Brewing Company because that's what the sign says. Or maybe it is because Fate brought me there to put a slice of heaven in my mouth. Monday is the day to go if it's your first time. You'll get a discount on drinks and half-price pizzas. The first time I went, we ordered a pretzel and two pizzas. The pretzels are fantastic! Fluffy and salty with the right amount crunch on the outside. The pretzel comes with a really tasty beer cheese that I could eat by itself as another appetizer. When our pizza came I had my doubts. We ordered the Sow Sweet, and I wasn't too keen on apples on my pizza. I can't emphasize enough how pleasantly delighted I was about how wrong I was about apples on pizza. It's fair to say that this pizza changed my life. I wanted more and more of it! I have thought about it everyday since I had it. We went back tonight and tried two other pizzas. They were good, just not life-changers. To be fair, how many life changing items could be on a restaurant's menu? Their crust is delicious and you can tell the the employees who run the oven really care about the pizzas they are making. Nothing goes as far as love does when ingredients are concerned. Fate also has an excellent selection of beers on tap. If you like a good IPA they have plenty to chose from as well as some darks that are very good. The fire hatch chile gatos has some spice to it and could be compared to drinking a spicy bloody mary as a beer. To sum up Fate, all I need to say is.... go! They deliver on multiple levels. So far I have yet to find something I don't like there and their servers are very friendly. Both experiences have been great and my taste buds are still dancing knowing I have some left overs!",

Paulo is the best bartender ever, on point; prompt; & very respectful...you don't wait with him!!!  I had a bad experience with \"A\" staff member, which ruined it for me.

My husband and I come here pretty often so I also appreciate that they offer a full bar selection in addition to their beers (they make a great Moscow Mule!). The staff couldn't be friendlier or more helpful and eager to please.   In addition to the great beverages, their food far surpassed my initial expectations! The best thing on the menu is definitely the pizzas. They're different from many of the other neighborhood pizza joints and they have a variety of options. The grape salad is another favorite. We even had this location cater our rehearsal dinner and everyone raved about the food. They gave us an excellent deal and made the whole process wonderfully easy. We will continue visiting this location! Cheers!",

We tried the triple, the red, and, stay with me here, the hatch chili beer! Sounds weird, but it's got an amazing aroma and after taste.   The food was fine. We got the \"sticky fingers\" pizza, drizzled with honey, topped with arugula. We also tried the farmer's salad, which was below average.

We started off with two nitro beers, both were amazing, but I cannot remember the names and it's not on their website.   I was starving so I ordered the Roasted Grape salad and the Sticky Fingers pizza due to the delicious habanero honey. I ended up ordering a side of it because it was so damn good! And yes, I did have sticky fingers and no, they do not have wet wipes.  Let me tell yah, it was so hard for me to hold myself back, I only ate 3 slices, but I wanted to eat the whole pizza! Gotta watch my figure though. ;)  With regard to the roasted grape salad, it was fantastic, but next time I will be asking for the dressing on the side as it came mixed in.   The customer service was excellent - the bartender we had was knowledgeable and hilarious. He recommended I should order the buffalo chicken wrap with habanero honey next time I am in, so I will probably do that next week.   All in all, this place was fantastic and I cannot wait to go back!",

If your looking for something you can drink several of and still keep it together, this fits the bill. Their stout and regular IPA were also quite good. However, the Berliner-Weiss was under-carbonated - almost flat. The bartender was very pleasant and recommended a terrific pizza. I will certainly be back when I am in the area.",

    "text": "As I was finishing up my yelp reviews from a recent trip to Firestone Walker in Paso Robles, I was shocked to see i had not written about my new favorite brewery in AZ.  \"FINALLY!  A BREWERY IN NORTH SCOTTSDALE...\" is basically my reaction to Fate Brewery.  One \"fateful\" night (pun intended) when I decided to stop in to try their Imperial IPA, a love affair began that I don't anticipate ending anytime soon.  I will admit, at first, I was skeptcal.  There are so many places that have come and gone...there will always be the places that \"have decent craft beer, for the area.\"  That was my initial hesitation upon opening, and is probably why it took me months to finally give them a try.  I was pleasantly surprised when the beer was one of the best I've had in the valley.  Although the location seems small, it's more than adequate.  Their patio is awesome in the cooler months.  They have enough tables where you never feel like you have to wait long, but never feel like it's too empty.  Personally I favor sitting at the bar, no matter where I go.  Their bar is really cool, and the chairs are spaced appropriately so you don't feel like you're sitting on top of the person next to you.  On to the important stuff, the beer.  I've noticed over the past few months, they have done a really good job of satisfying all palattes. Whether you're a hop head, or more of a fruit beer, or maybe something darker, there has been at least one of each on their menu.  I am a hop head through and through, and their American Pale Ale and recently released IPA are my favorite in Arizona right now.  They also often release specialty beers that have never disappointed (for instance, a coffee IPA).  I have only had pizza there, and it was great.  Love the hot chili oil.  The atmosphere to me is the closest you'll get to a \"cheers\" type of bar.  Maybe being from the east coast I'm more acclimated to this type of vibe, but it's small, quaint, welcoming, and inviting.  I have gone in with my husband, with my girlfriends, or sat by myself, and I've always felt comfortable, and have always met really cool people along the way.   For me what sets this bar apart is the service.  Steve has done a really great job of assembling an awesome team, who remembers who you are, and what you like to drink.  And Steve is such a nice person.  It's fun chatting him up about his beer.  Their social media and website are always up to date, so check regularly to see if there's anything special on.  I think what you do need to realize before going in is, it's a small brewery with a decent size list of oustanding beers.  This isn't a Yardhouse type of establishment.  And you don't have to be a beer expert or beer snob to enjoy it.  From what I've experienced, if you ever have any questions, or want to try anything, all you have to do is ask.",

Fine if you don't have any questions about the menu, etc. Nice guy but much more interested in talking about anything other than the food or beer. Very nice. But I did come for the food and beer.   Would I come back? Maybe. There's probably better but it definitely wasn't bad. Just meh. So if you're looking for a meh experience with decent beer and a similar happy hour menu, check it out.",

It is always something different for the spread, last time it was jalepeno jelly and cream cheese. Then for the \"bread\" they give you pita bread and baguette bread. (It is served each time with three different spreads). So delicious.  The food/beer is delicious. I love the atmosphere, service and the bathrooms are always clean!",

I started with the double IPA being it has a 100 IBU and a specific gravity of 8.5! Nice start! I ordered the Sunnyside pizza and was not disappointed in any fashion. The crust was thin and crispy all the way to the center. If you like the pies at Pane Bianco or Pizzeria Bianco you'll like these just as well (although the dough is not as salty). Also try some of the chili oil. I always like a little extra oil on my pizza and this was just what I like, a little extra flavor and a bump in heat.  The menu isn't large, which is good, because it allows them to concentrate on what they do best.  Very good overall including the service.",

Their beer is always delicious and their descriptions are always spot on. I would recommend a few beers, but chances are they will not be on tap when you are there as they are constantly rotating. The food is the same, excellent and consistent. The Jess and Pablo Honey are my personal favorite pizzas, but am regularly impressed with the rotating special pizzas. The atmosphere is good, if a bit simple. I like that you can see the brewing area but that it is separated by glass. I dig that the taps are skateboard trucks as well.

Not wild like four peaks, with a pretty clean an classy ambiance. Still small enough of an operation to know most of the servers by name, and the beer is always solid. Go for the pizzas. They're bistro quality. Love the Pablo Honey and the Jess.   Simple. Classy. Solid. This place needs to be found more often.",

Wouldn't recommend it to anyone even though I never tried the food. Much better breweries in the area.",

    "text": "Went on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Ashlee was our server and it was fun to visit with her. She knew her beers, is a hop head, and directed me to the Double Oatmeal IPA which was amazing. They had a good brunch menu; I had the classic breakfast pizza and my wife had the bacon and mushroom frittata skillet.  As we waited for our food and I enjoyed the Double Oatmeal IPA, Ashlee brought over samples of the other Fate brews saying she enjoyed talking to craft brew fans and wanted us to taste their other beers as well. I tend toward IPAs and the pale ale was excellent but I was surprised by the red, absent the over-sweet maltiness I've tasted in a lot of microbrews of that style. It was dark but not heavy, with just enough hop to balance the malt or rye. I ended up taking home a growler of the red though I'd planned on a growler of the Pale Ale, both for the variety and because it was so good. Truth be told, I also took home a \"growlerette\" of the Double Oatmeal IPA. The \"growlerette\" was a cool small growler with a flip top that would be reused and enjoyed by home brewers, and is just cool looking.  Matching the beer, the food was very good. My classic breakfast pizza had olive oil, bacon, rosemary roasted potatoes, mozzarella, cracked egg and was finished with fresh herb. It was a nine inch pizza with a crisp crust. The egg, cheese, and potatoes matched well and contrasted with the crunch of the crust. My wife's frittata was also very good and she commented more than once on the flavor of the rosemary roasted potatoes coming through. Hers was served in a small cast iron skillet on a board with pegs holding it in place. The server who brought the food to our table noted our choices and said we were in for a treat. He was right. Ashlee came by and noticed I'd not eaten the crust of the pizza and she suggested trying the pepper oil on the table with the crust. I turned out I cleaned the plate with the pepper oil and crust.  Service, food, and beer were all top notch. In our family we have a tradition of choosing a restaurant for our birthdays and, for the last few years, my choice has been either Four Peaks in Tempe or San Tan Brewery in Chandler. While I still love both of those breweries, Fate will be where I draw my family from across the valley for my next birthday.  Don't miss this place!",

We originally came in just to try the beer but after hanging out for a while and smelling the wood oven we gave in and ordered a pizza.  I am so glad we did, the pizza was one of the best I have had in quite a while.  We had the Con Carne wood fired pizza and the meat was perfect and the fresh herbs tied it all together and rounded out the flavor nicely.  We tried all of the beers that had and all were good.  My favorites were the Single Hop Sour and the Oh My Gatos Golden Ale.  Fun name as well!  If you are looking for a cool little spot with easy parking, friendly employees and great food and beer Fate will hit the spot.",

    "text": "At 74th Street and Shea Boulevard in Scottsdale, a combination of brewery, pizzeria and pub, Fate's emphasis is on small-batch beer and wood-fired pies, according to founder and master brewer Steve McFate. He previously was with Colorado Boy Pub & Brewery in Ridgway, Colo., and promises Valley beer lovers a lineup of rotating traditional favorites, experimental recipes, seasonal brews and casks on tap.  Happy Hour brought me $3 Fate Belgian Saison Farmhouse Ale. Poured a golden colored body, into a rinsed tulip glass. Classic barnyard flavors of hay, earth and spices from the Belgian yeast and crisp malt. Very enjoyable.  There is a rotation of beers from light to dark. I did sample the smoked porter which had a distinctive smoke flavour imparted by using malted barley dried over an open flame. An excellent dark beer.  Fate Growlers were up on the shelves and also now have Growlettes which is 1 liter of delicious beer for only $12 New and $8 to Refill.",

I obviously frequent this gem spot often, making it one of my go to spots for great food, great brews & great atmosphere. I'm never disappointed. Travis & Tony are exceptional employees with an over achieving attitude. We are always greeted with a smile and a warm welcome. As far as some of my favorite brews & bites, here they are (in no particular order) Oh my Gators (brew) Candy Bar Milk Stout (seasonal brew) Green Flash (guest beer) The Jess (pizza) The Con Carne (pizza) Twists of Fate (app) The McFatta Platta (app) & the Caprese Salad. They have a rotating food menu as well as a rotating brew selection, so you are always able to try something new.  My tastebuds crave their delightful dishes as least once a week. If you have never been here, you're seriously missing out! It's worth the commute if you don't live local. They also have a location in Old Town Scottsdale. Give them a shot! I promise you won't be disappointed!!!",

The combination of yummy fresh food plus beer is awesome, and when you can add cake pops to the mix, well it's hard to put all that happiness in words. The brewery restaurant itself is nice - lots of light, outdoor seating with a garage-type door that opens out onto a patio, view of the brewing cask/tanks, and warm soothing colors. We had:  - Garlic Pizza: Damn good! Flavorful garlic olive oil sauce, lots of cheese, and fresh basic and tomatoes. The crust is really good. - House Salad: Always impressive when a place that serves beer can also make a good salad. Lots of cheese and other toppings, and everything was fresh. - The Beer: Pretty good. I was a little disappointed in the Cream Ale because I was expecting a luscious creamy beer, but it wasn't. In fact I thought the Hefe was way more creamy.   Overall, Fate Brewery is a great place to go with friends or a date or coworkers. The people working there all seemed really nice, and we had a good time there.",

    "text": "Fate is by far our favorite brewery in AZ. Their beer is among tops in the state. Hubby and I have very differing tastes. He likes super hoppy, I prefer lighter or sour. His favorite is the double Oatmeal IPA. I love the Hatch Chili Cream ale and the Gose they made last year was superb. I hope it comes back this year!  And the Candybar Milk Stout is worth the visit. Can't beat their beer prices either if you ask me.  And we enjoy the creativity with which they approach beer making. Even when their own beer is in short supply, the guest list is more than sufficient. And limited Fate supply should soon be a thing of the past with the new location open.   I've seen several complaints about the menu. We've always loved the food and tried just about everything on the menu. Of course there will always be items that aren't your favorite so I'm not really sure why people give poor reviews just because they don't like the Irish Nachos?   As far as service, Fate is our favorite place for service. We are at this point regulars. We know almost everyone by name and they treat us with the same kind of genuine respect and kindness we give to them. The feel is very laid back. So if you're expecting to feel catered to just because it's Scottsdale you will be disappointed. But trust me, if you are a good patron you will be well taken care of.   Our almost weekly visits will continue!",

Basically cheese covered breadsticks with a side of marinara for dipping.  It was good.  Hubby ordered the Rustica pizza - garlic olive oil, artichoke hearts, roasted red bell pepper, capicola, gorgonzola cheese.  Since I am not a fan of gorgonzola cheese, I did not really eat it.  I did take a bite to see how well excuted the pizza was, and I must say I found it pretty good with a great crust.  Even though  I had enjoyed the couple bites of pizza, I stopped because the gorgonzola taste would eventually overwhelm me and then I would hate it.  But hubby loved it.  Cake pops were pretty good too.  Had the snickerdoodle and the red velvet.   Service was friendly and efficient.  Solid place I will come back to.",

They even set up a different table for all of our pizza selections, since we had so many.  The wait for the pizzas were very short and all of the pizzas were delicious.

    "text": "More and more, Arizona is being bombarded by breweries, and it's becoming harder for them to stand out cause, quite frankly, a lot of the beer tastes the same, the food is typical, and the \"unique\" crafts just don't tickle my tastebuds. Fortunately, Fate has a couple of those standouts that would make me want to head back over there...the chili oil and the chocolate-chili milk stout!   I know, the chili oil? Yep. It's actually packed with great flavor that goes perfectly with any of Fate's carbohydrates (I only tried the flatbread app and potato nachos -- just okay). If you ever had the pleasure of going to a restaurant named Aiello's before it closed, you'll remember their complementary chili oil app. Fate's oil reminded me of that immediately! It's just spicy enough, and it's loaded with delicious chili, oil, and oregano flavor. The chocolate-chili stout was also perfectly spicy! The first few sips were reminiscent of any tasty chocolate/coffee milk stout, but after your palate has been engulfed with it, you start to get hints of spice that build slowly while you venture to the snifter's plinth. Delicious.  I'm looking forward to checking Fate out again, and I'm hoping the service will be a little better the next time (it was busy). And, I'll be sure to try their pizza because, c'mon, I like pizza and beer!   Salut!",

    "text": "This place actually looked pretty nice inside for a brewery but I was sitting out on the patio with a group of my fellow Yelpers. Even though we were a large party, the service was great. Fate has a pretty limited food menu... just pizza and a couple salad and appetizer options. Most of us seemed to enjoy our pizza. The hubby and I ordered the pesto one and it was pretty tasty. Not the best pizza I've ever had but good. Anyway, it's a brewery so one does not come here for the food. Since I had never been here before I went ahead and did a full flight (4oz pours of all 6 beers) and here are my thoughts on their brews:  Strawberry Rhubarb - This was described as a Berliner Weisse which is a beer style I am not at all familiar with but based on the name I thought it would be sweet. To my surprise, it was actually pretty sour (I now know that is how it is supposed to be). But it really did taste just like strawberry rhubarb pie but just not sweetened... you know that fruity but tart flavor? They completely captured it. Yummy! I liked this one more than I expected to.  Cream Ale - This was my least favorite beer at Fate. It did not have enough flavor or body. I was expecting more maltiness (is that a word?)  I guess if you are a lager drinker (which I am not) you would enjoy it. Probably would taste better in the summer on a hot day.  Irish Red - Almost everyone at the table (myself included) agreed this is their best beer. On the menu it said this had won an award at the Great American Beer Festival in CO and I can see why. Flavor was perfectly balanced. Tasty hops but not too bitter. Just a fantastic beer.  American Pale Ale - I have never been a fan of IPAs but I have recently developed a taste for American or \"West Coast\" pale ales. Just hoppy enough to wake up your palate but not too much that it is intensely bitter. This one had a nice malty flavor to it as well. I guess for a True hop head it might not be enough hops but I really enjoyed it very much.  Double Oatmeal IPA - This one was very interesting. I have never experienced (or even heard of) an oatmeal IPA before. I love oatmeal stouts because they have that nice, creamy mouthfeel to them (yeah, that's right, I said mouthfeel). This one had that same texture but was really hoppy like you would expect from an IPA. I couldn't quite decide if I liked it or not. Next time I'll have to get a whole pint so I can figure it out. They don't have the ABV values on their website but if I remember from the menu this one was pretty strong.  Oatmeal Stout - This style is just always a tasty beer in my book and this one was no exception. I would drink beer this any day of the week. It had a beautiful rich, dark color to it. Also a great flavor and just the perfect touch of sweetness.",

    "text": "I like trying new things. Its fun and hip. While killing some time before doing side work on a Sunday, I did a Yelp Search and *poof* Fate Brewing popped up. Lets review:  ~Fud/Drink~ The food here is pretty urban and \"gastropub-ish\" if you ask me. I had the Scarlet Skillet Omelet (see pic) which was very good. Everything mixed together very well, even if it looks like something your cat yacked up....it was very good. I ordered a bloody beer (they actually name it that on the menu, score) with their light ale.  All their dishes look good, prices are a tad high but the quality is there. Of the crafts they brew, all but 1 was dark or very hoppy, which is why they lose a whole star. The variety simply was not there if you like anything relatively light or refreshing.  Even the ale they gave me was a Pale Ale which, I am not a fan of. It had the traditional PA hoppy kick. It tasted good with my bloody mix in it...but still, where is the variety? The guest beers were also all very hoppy or dark, so even if I jumped over to the guest list its difficult. I know its winter, but not every winter beer HAS to be dark... I am still getting used to dark beers, so I am totally up to trying new things... but give me variety!!!  ~Atmosphere/Service~ This place has a hipster feel to it. A lot of ironic items throughout, like the tool bench drawer used to cart off used growlers or old drinks...or some of the chairs which are made out of random materials. The large stone bar-top is inviting and spacious, allowing for a lot of items to be strewn across. A comparable amount of tables are inside, as well as a short-but-sweet patio up front. Service was good, one barkeep for the lot of us at the bar on a Sunday is OK. He was helpful and gave me a couple samples to try. Nothing overwhelming in either direction...nice guy.  It definitely has an open, relaxing feel to it. Really relaxing and comforting place to head over to on a Sat-Sun morning, I feel. You won't look/feel like an alchy if you come in for a drink or two and get some brunch.  ~The Down Low~ Good solid spot to unwind, upscale in some aspects, with an emphasis on hipsterism in some areas. Come on down, its a fun place to be as you can tell that a lot of beer enthusiasts come here. They get 4 stars for fun/refreshing set-up, good mix on menu, well made craft beers, and an inviting atmosphere.",

They also offer some great offering from other local and nonlocal brewers.  Staff friendly and beer smart, which is a plus.  Food menu, although not extensive, is fantastic with their wood fired pies and clever apps.  Not a big place so try to get there when they open or you may have to fight off other beer aficionados for a table. (We went on Fathers day. Got there when it opened and ten minutes later, they had a 20 min wait). So I urge anyone who likes to eat and/or drink to try Fate!",

Saw on yelp and later their website they were open till 11pm, Saturday's. We got their at 10pm and saw what appeared to be three employees talking behind the bar. There were two customers at the bar and two more seated in the restaurant area. Although the employees looked at us walk in, no one acknowledged our existence. The three of us sat down at a table thinking someone would come give us menus and take drink orders. No one bothered coming over to us or greeting us. After approximately 5-10 minutes we left without ever talking to an employee. They may have decent beer, decent food, but their service is unacceptable and if continues I'd assume even in Scottsdale they'll die off because people have better service options serving similar fare.  We went a couple miles west to OHSO Brewery had a great time.",

Our group very much appreciated this generosity!  I had the Mr. Pineapple beer as it seemed the lightest beer on the menu; they had I think 9 others on the Happy Hour menu. Crisp and refreshing beer.  My husband and I shared one of the wood fired pepperoni pizzas; I think it was $12. The serving size was great for us to share... others might call this a super sized personal pizza. Maybe about 14\". It was a good pizza; sauce had a nice spice to it. Ours was slightly over cooked but our friends Margarita pizza looked perfect. That's the risk with wood fired pizza's. The wine selection wasn't all that great and overpriced compared to what I've paid at bars... they really had restaurant prices on the wine (a $12 bottle at Bevmo is $35 here). A friend ordered a bottle of red wine and it was way too warm... in AZ you really need to have all your wine in a cooler; the room temperatures here are just too hot for wine serving. So I'd pass on the wine here and stick with the beer - but hey, it's a brewery so beer is really the way to go. Interior is industrial looking, I liked it. They have a medium sized patio out front and a garage door at the entrance they can open to bring the spaces together.  We had really good service too. We will def. be back to this place... perhaps I'll try a beer flight next time.",

Simple and clean decorations and has viewing of the brewing gear, a pretty small place in general.  Menu is basically a pizza place (have wood fired oven) with salads and bar snacks. Not wide offering but good. Pablo honey pizza was a nice change of pace.  So after i go back when they have some more stouts and balanced beers i will review again.",

    "text": "This is an easy 5 star rating for me. Looking for tremendous beer, awesome pizza and great service? Fate Brewing is the place for you. This has such a great \"neighborhood\" restaurant/brewery feel that invites you in and brings a smile to your face. The employees are all incredibly nice and seem to genuinely be enjoying their job. The brews rotate often, so stop in to see what's on tap or check their Facebook page...they update new happenings quite often. The pizzas are wood fired and have nice a thin crust with very fresh toppings. Nice salads too. Cheers to the whole crew at Fate!",

If it were just a tap room, I'd give it two stars at most. But the pizza is good, the service was friendly and prompt, and it's a nice place. Just don't expect much from the beer and you should be happy.",

I tried the standard IPA and it was delicious. Very refreshing and not overly hoppy and heavy with a nice citrus hint! (Perfect for a hot day if you dont want a lighter beer) Also tried a sample of the oatmeal double IPA which is wonderful. Service and atmosphere are nice. I would come back and try the pizza we didnt eat but it looked amazing!",

Pizza was excellent--great flavor and fast delivery out of their great looking wood burning oven.  Their local brews taste great--the cream ale is spot on--also nice guest brews on tap--leg humper hefe is next best thing to a Franziskaner.  Lots of parking in the back--expect this place to do very well.  Simple menu, good value and cold beer!  Check it out--",

My Mom loved the Irish Red, Dad loved the Belgo, and I had a Fate Imperial IPA and a Black IPA, both of which were fantastic.  Especially dug the Black IPA, love to see those!  Our server Steven was so nice and helpful and the manager, Ben, was wonderful as well.  This is a great place to drop in and have a beer, love that you can see the brewing equipment as well as the kitchen, it really adds to the awesome atmosphere!",
