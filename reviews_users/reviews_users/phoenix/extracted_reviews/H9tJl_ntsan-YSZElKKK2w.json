    "text": "For me, the Smith was impressive from the start. I first visited about two weeks after they opened and then proceeded to return every weekend for over a month. The green chili pork breakfast is fabulous. The pork falls apart. The sauce has a nice kick, but isn't too spicy. The tortillas are served warm and taste fresh. On top of that, the dish is so large I can easily take half home to make tacos the next day. It's awesome. The husband loved their pancakes..... Buuut unfortunately they took them off the menu  because they were taking too long to make. This puts us in a bind, since the husband can't eat egg dishes and doesn't want chia pudding. They did say they might bring the delish pancakes back as a special. The coffee here is good and the wait staff keep it coming. I also went once for lunch and had a super delish chicken sandwich that was just as good the next day as it was the first.....yummmm.  So here are the negatives: the French toast is not that sweet, not that flavorful, and generally a waste of calories. The b and e roll sounds good, but really isn't. The pretzel rolls is way too prevalent, overwhelming the other flavors.   Overall, this restaurant has a lot of high points, but order carefully my friends.",

The food was delicious (I got the B&E roll, seriously recommend it!) and my iced latte was one of the best I've had in the Phoenix area.  The kind service really stood out, though. Our waiter was attentive with refilling drinks and checking in, and he even gave me a free latte to go, since my car died in the parking lot and my friends and I had to wait for the tow truck after our meal. Such a nice surprise!  Then when the tow truck arrived, another staff member came out and offered us some water while we waited for the driver to get my car ready to go, as it was quite hot outside.  I'll definitely return! Can't wait to try some more items off the menu, and hopefully no car issues next time.",

I had a veggie omelet with their potatoes which were awesome. My friends ordered other dishes I can't recall (sorry I was too hungry) but both said their entrees were spectacular (yes, SPECTACULAR!). It looked it, I was tempted to taste it. Anyways, the service was on point. They were so attentive, friendly, and available and it got busy for lunch too. I love finding a cool funky place like this with indoor and outdoor seating that has amazing service and food. What more could anyone want? Well, I'll tell ya. They have great options for vegans, vegetarians and carnivores alike! What do you have to say now? Go to The Smith, you'll thank me for it and feel destined to leave them 5 stars!",

We ordered very basic breakfast items, eggs, bacon, toast, and an omelette. There are extravagant items available but we just wanted something basic. We waited for 45 minutes for our order to come and when it finally came it was wrong and awful. She had ordered scrambled eggs but they can out as over easy eggs. I ordered a bacon and sausage omelette, but it was far from an omelette. It was literally just overcooked pan cooked eggs with meat just sitting inside it. The house potatoes weren't really good with the addition of ketchup. The only good part was the bacon and toast, that's all. Maybe if we got something not so basic would be good but I'm not trying it out again.",

    "text": "I love shopping local - being involved with the movement since its early day when LocalFirstAZ just started - so I actually waited almost two weeks to write this.   I went in to The Smith (great name and logo) and was confused about whether or not to seat myself, but someone called to me and let me know they'd help me in a minute. Kinda awkward.  I got my table and ordered a build your own omelet right away. The omelet came quickly. It was basically an overlooked disc of eggs with a melted slice of cheese in a lump and some veggies stuck to it on one side. There was also a side of potatoes that had great flavor but were really dry and warm-ish  The server checked back (yay!) and I explained my problem.  He looked at me like eggs were supposed to be mottled brown discs and unenthusiastically asked what he could do for me. I suggested I'd just take some scrambled eggs and eat them with my veggies. I requested that they weren't brown \"in any way\". My next dish was a browned bunch of eggs.   I asked for the manager who turned out to be the owner, Roscoe. He was nice and told me he was interested in honest feedback so I shared my thoughts. I said I'd try again another time because other dishes looked good around me, but the egg situation should be given some attention.   The decor was almost there but too industrial to be comfortable - very cold and unhappy. The music was also cool, bands I love, but too fast to eat to.  Hopefully, honest, constructive feedback will be considered because I'd really like to see Roscoe and team succeed.",

This place did not disappoint - we ordered the Smith Hash and the Green Chile Bowl with a side of country potatoes. The hash was spicy, but they flavor of the house cured corned beef was fantastic! The potatoes on the side were crispier than the ones served with the hash. I could have used one more egg with the hash, but overall it was a perfect place. I didn't try the green chili bowl but my husband was satisfied.",

My man loves their corned beef hash, so he tried the corned beef sandwich today - to die for. The caprese sandwich was delicious. The almond pesto was phenomenal - couldn't get enough.  I cannot wait to try pancakes or French toast with berry compote. Saw it getting tossed on some French toast earlier and it looked so yummy.  The interior is great - the wood tables and siding along the bar and kitchen area make it seem homey and I love how clean and simple everything seems.   So glad the Base team has opened this spot. This is such a step up from Acacia Cafe. Props, guys.  Check this place out as soon as you can!",

The waiting staff was not terribly friendly.  They seemed somewhat bothered to be there.  They gave 3 ice waters without asking, which is a lost art in my opinion.  So kudos for that.  The coffee was tasty and my nephews had fresh orange juice which they liked.  I order the Noble french toast with an extra slice, my nephew did also.  My other nephew had the breakfast burrito.  The wait for the food was not long and the server kept my water and coffee full, more kudos.  When the food came, I was greeted with 3 giant slices of french toast with homemade orange infused whipped cream.  Only complaint there was that it was near frozen and couldn't be spread.  The blueberry compote was delish.  Had a hard time finishing 3 slices, 2 is probably enough.  My nephews burrito was enormous and I had a bite.  Was also very tasty.  All in all, I'd reccomend a stop by this place and hope that it was just an off day for the staff.",

No sign of the snottiness often associated with the high quality, locally sourced menu.  My wife and I had the French toast and chilaquiles, respectively.  Everything was just right.  The French toast wasn't too sweet (as is so often the case) and the chilaquiles not too salty (even w me adding a side of chorizo).  Spicy enough, but not so much that it overcomes the rest of the dish.    And after what would usually be coma-inducing choices, we feel surprisingly good and Mobile.  Definitely bringing the kiddos next time to try the fresh churros which looked spectacular walking by...",

Rosemary makes everything just so dang delicious.  I'm actually not even that into the big English style brekkie, but sometimes you just need a really big breakfast. Sometimes, your air goes out on the hottest day of the year. When that happens, you need to find a cool place to wait and a meal with enough variety to distract you from your problems.  I mean, food is cheaper than therapy. Actually, no, it's not, because I have to pay for two different gyms to balance out all my \"therapy.\" Dammit.  I will probably be back for this better than London English breakfast feast, and if not, I'll be back to try something else. Cause breakfast food is life.",

As we walked in the lady at the front just simply pointed to where we could sit which was \"that middle booth over there\". No big deal as we truly didn't need to be walked to the table. We sat and waited a bit for one more in our party. We decided to go ahead and order while we waited on that person. When our food came the order wasn't exactly as we ordered. Asked to have somethings on the side as my wife has allergies to oranges. Nevertheless, the French toast was brought out with the orange whipped cream. She just picked around it. Our other person showed up and order. He asked for a drink and his food the food was brought out with no problem. He never got his drink.   While we were eating not once did anyone come to check on us. They entire staff sat at the bar talking with each other. I wanted to order more food but decided not to as no one had come over to see how we were doing. Out water glasses at this point was empty. So much so I had to ask my wife for a drink of hers. As we were handed the bill she never asked if we needed anything else beside a box for the French toast that we had picked around.   Not sure if she wasn't having a good day or not but the service was completely unacceptable. This is unfortunate because the food was good but with service like this we won't be going back. Hopefully it was just a bad day because this is a sure way to lose customers in an area that has many good options.",

Almost immediately realized upon sitting down it is owned by the same people as Base Pizzeria, and we love that restaurant. Good sign #1. Child/baby friendly, great friendly service, and yes, the food was delicious- we both had the special - it was like a chilequiles benedict with chorizo and the eggs were poached perfectly, and ordered a side of the bacon which was delicious as well. So happy to have found this place in our hood and can't wait to try more from their menu!",

The menu is concise but gives an array of options to fit your tastebuds for brunch. The portions are large enough to get full, however execution from the kitchen could use a little improvement. I asked for \"crispy bacon,\" but what I received was a pile of mostly burned in some places, but undercooked in other places, bacon stacked on my plate. On the up side, I notified the waitress of the issue and a new, evenly cooked order of bacon was brought out quickly enough for me to enjoy it with the rest of my meal. I normally would have not mentioned something so minor in a review but this bacon was initially burned badly, staff should not put food they see is not quality onto someone's plate. Overall though, I'd give them a try again for service alone.",

She seemed super positive, she was never on her phone, always running to tend to the emotional food needs and desires of all the various customers. It's amazing to watch such correlated and knowledgeable management of the restaurant and time from Chayse. She gave me everything I ever needed. I have one complaint though she kept asking for my sausage. I said she could have the tip but she wanted the whole sausage. I was intrigued and perplexed... is that what they call a food-gasm? Either way, Chayse( my future wife) is awesome and Megan is pretty cool too. I would probably make them co-presidents of the Smith if that position was available. Just saying, they're pretty vegan.",

Only challenge is its late in their business cycle for the day, will it be as  good, they say restaurant thrive when they are busy, its bumpy after the rush. It was a bit bumpy.  Nice menu, simple, not too exciting. The food took a long time and my pet peeve is servers not keeping you informed along the way. Coffee (very good) was not filled in the interim and it was starting to turn down when empty restaurant couldn't come up with food in a reasonable time.  Food was fresh, better than average , the only issue is my corned beef sandwich still has pieces of picking spice in the sandwich, didn't know if it was suppose to be there, though sandwich was \"off\" and  after thinking about it, it was a sloppy mistake by the Kitchen, yuk. What operators and staff need to remember is that customers often come a long way just to eat in their establishment, it needs to be extra special for them to return, wow factor. This fell short.  Two other suggestions, bring house made chips or fries to the menu. Also a piece of bread with the entree salads. When guests sit with nothing to do or eat while waiting 25 minutes, things turn south quickly.",

We are particularly fond of the green chili bowl and the hash presentation, but you won't go wrong with anything. If you are going to have the hot oil, I'd suggest getting it on the side: it is liquid fire! Enjoy the bottomless cup of coffee.

He quickly replied \"Green chile!\" \"That's what I'll have then!\" I said. The food came quickly as did the coffee. There were only a couple others in the shop when I was there but others followed in quickly. The green chile was good but not great. It was a little too acidic for me. Also, it was hot both spice and temperature-wise. The unfortunate part was the heat came from an abundance of dried red pepper flake over the top rather than natural heat from the green chile. This made the flavors clash and was the primary reason for the 3 stars. Maybe I'll try the hash next time.",

As another reviewer said, there really isn't a hostess so you have to catch a server's eye to be directed to a table.  The menus are on the table but it took a while for someone to get me a drink and take my order.  Speaking of drinks, I was interested in one of their $3 Arnold Palmers but when I asked about refills or to go cups and was told that's not what they do I decided to pass.  On a positive note, my corned beef sandwich had good taste.  If you are it's thinking a large deli-sized corned beef sandwich then think again.  This was more of a ladies-who-lunch portion.  I'm not sure that I'd seek this place out again.  There are a lot of other great options in this neighborhood.",

    "text": "Brunch is easily my most self-indulgent sin and not something I do often nor take lightly.   Phoenix has become a culinary paradise over the last 10 years and with all the excellent chefs and options restaurants must be on their game to impress.  The Smith Cafe has elevated my taste buds to another stratosphere. The place is open and casual with a great little patio. The staff is warm and truly engaged. So, let's talk about my brunch.  Corned beef hash is by no means 'haute cuisine' and not always available on breakfast menus at most places. 3on not only nailed this, they DOMINATE!! Homemade, with fresh potatoes and real brisket, they balance a touch of spice with nutmeg that brightens all the components of savory and spice, proteins and starch leaving my palate with an unforgettable experience!  Not that I needed anymore to eat,  brunch somehow feels incomplete without bacon. Theirs did not disappoint. (Is that a hint of maple??) Generous enough portion to share, too!  I cannot wait to come back and try EVERYTHING. Bravo!!",

My friends and I had good service, food came out quick, and was delicious. My daughter and I had shared the Hungry man, which was A LOT of food, but very good, and a good amount to share between us. The French toast is amazingly sweet tasting. A small outdoor patio is simple and works for group setting, but the tables and chairs are wobbly and hard to maneuver with the wood plank deck. The patio also needs more shade now that temps are warming. While we were seated against the building, by 11:30-12, our friends who were backed to the parking lot were getting beamed on by the sun. Maybe some misters and pergola over structure would be nice. Inside is modern and simple, with private single restrooms. While I used the restroom during our visit, I didn't recall seeing a baby changing table. Seating inside isn't really accommodating for large groups, which is a bummer. But they do have a great menu choice, and kids items reasonably priced.",

It's got an open kitchen, which makes it feel welcoming.

Stinks because after all those raving reviews I'm sure it could be good. It may have just been over cooked and left out? Not sure. It was takeout and we waited 45 minutes for it to be cooked. I thought typically they don't make Togo orders wait as long. It tasted like it needed some salsa or sour cream. Probably because it was so dry. Petty much tasteless besides the spice. Egg I don't taste..... I suppose if we ate there I could send it back, but the 45 min wait for them to bring our food made me extra hungry then in our Togo bags had no salt pepper or anything. Good thing I added avocado otherwise if we eating over cooked onions and hard potatoes. I saw some reviews that were extra greasy with oil, I almost think that would be better than an overcooked no egg Skillet.",

    "text": "Arriving at about 11:30 on a weekday, I was surprised to be offered breakfast or lunch.  Breakfast actually sounded pretty good, so that is what we went with.  We were warmly greeted as we walked in from the patio, and decided to sit on the west-facing patio as it was a warm day.    The Smith was once The Acacia Cafe, a place we visited on occasion for fresh sandwiches and we had been hearing about the changes for a few months.  Celebrating the completion of our Tax Returns, the wife decided she needed a treat and this was it.  Finding a shady table, we ordered green iced tea for her, and black iced tea for me.  It seems that many of the Queen's subjects have a disdain for iced tea, but I would guess they've never really tried a good, fresh-brewed iced tea.  Apparently, the black tea I was served was not fresh, as evident by the fungish sour taste, but it was quickly and unquestioningly replaced with the green tea which was very tasty.  Tea has such a high profit margin that it should always be served fresh and stored cold after brewing, especially since it does not sit well in a tepid container and will ferment quickly.  Given that, I am a bit of a tea snob, so I can be somewhat critical of a bad brew.  Moving on to our 'brekkie', the wife had the traditional brekkie sandwich, sans bacon, which I would have happily devoured.  I was intrigued by the green chille (sic) bowl and had to have me some of that.  This dish is slow cooked pork, green chilli sauce, over easy cage free egg, cotija, cilantro & pepitas with tortilla, served in a cast-iron boat.  It was quite tasty and a large portion of tender chunks of pork, but I would have liked a bit more green-chile spiciness.  I'm also a green-chile snob :-).  The wife loved her sandwich but wished she had asked for avocado added to it - perhaps next time.  Service was friendly, and our meal arrived quickly.  We enjoyed the quiet ambiance as we finished our breakfast, our tea glasses being refilled without question and before we needed.  Prices are a bit high, but that seems to be a trend in this Arcadia neighborhood, and the value for the meal was fair.",

    "text": "This is my first Yelp review and I couldnt keep from letting others know about this place.  Tried this place last Sunday in the 9 AM hour. It was just 2 of us and we were able to get a table immediately suprisingly due to the amount of customers already seated.    I ordered the green chili pork bowl and water.  My partner ordered bacon, eggs, toast, and potatoes and a tea.  Please be aware, your normal staple of condiments are not on the table (salt, pepper, sugar).  When she got her tea, she asked for sweetener.  She was given 2 packets of Splenda..she doesn't use Splenda so we had to wait for someone to come around again and ask for a different option.  We couldn't understand why they were so controlling w/ their condiments... As well there was someone continually walking around with coffee but I had to keep waiting on water refills....  It took 40 minutes to get breakfast!  When we did get our plates, they forgot her bacon!  Mine looked good but on the surface had ALOT of oil.  First bite I noticed decent flavor.  Next bite was fat...third bite was fat.... I ended up spending 5 minutes taking all the fat out of the bowl.  It equaled out to a third of the bowl!  The waiter and staff watched me go through this and no one offered to take the bowl back or give me something different.   They gave me a bowl to put the excess fat in!  No apologies for the time it took to get our plates or for the additional time I spent taking all the excess fat out that shouldn't have been in the bowl to begin with.  I decided I couldn't finish the bowl between the oil and fat.  I asked for a to go box so I could take what was left home and doctor it to work for me.  The waiter asked how everything was I told him about the bowl, still no explanation or apology.....definitely won't be back here.",

    "text": "3on Smith Cafe is a small Breakfast and Lunch Restaurant located in the Arcadia Part of Phoenix at Gaslight Square. It's a very casual restaurant with a big open kitchen. The atmosphere is energetic. The restaurant was named 3on Smith Cafe because Smith Street in Melbourne Australia is a sort of Restaurant Row and the three owners are from Australia. All the breakfast listed on the menu are called Brekkie because that is what they call breakfast in the land down under. I didn't notice any obviously Australian Foods offered but I can tell you that the breakfasts served looked big enough for you to hike the outback or a few Camelback Mountains.  We ordered sandwiches off the Lunch Menu.  I ordered the House Corned Beef Sandwich called the Corny Cow. WOW...how impressive for a small restaurant to make their own Corned Beef in-house. It's very rare that you will come across house made corned beef anywhere. I received a generously sized sandwich that came with a mixed greens side salad. The Corned Beef was very unique but good....It was tender, it had not too much and not too little fat and it was good..in the MOST DIFFERENT WAY. Flavored very different....than the usual corned beef and was heavy with what seemed like cloves, ginger and allspice. It was almost refreshing....in a really odd way. I guess it paired well with the charred onions and grilled sourdough and Swiss Cheese. It was a very non-traditional Corned Beef Sandwich but I have to say that it was very good.  My husband got the Green Pig Sandwich. It was tender, flavorful with just enough heat Green Chili Pork with pickled onion and a small squirt of just the right amount of cilantro aioli on a pretzel bun. I hear it was really good!  We were both really impressed with the value here as our sandwich platters cost less than we expected them to cost...but MORE IMPORTANTLY BOTH were quite delicious!  Service was quick and efficient...  A hidden gem! (for Brekkie and Sandwiches)",

I had the AVO SMASH with an egg and it was delicious and HUGE; matching the $16 charge.  My husband had the B&E ROLL, no bacon, with a generous portion of potatoes, $11. He liked it a lot. We both took half home for later. He had drip coffee and I had an Americano. Mine was good, but the dainty cup it was served in was too hot and uncomfortable to hold so I had them pour it into a to-go cup.  We will be back to try other items in the menu.",

The Queen Mother is HUGE...the mushroom is a-m-a-z-i-n-g. The Chilli Bowl has the right amount of spice and the pork is soooo tender. One of the review said it has too much oil, I don't found that to be the case, it is pulled pork after all, I'm surprised it didn't have more oil.  Oh, their coffee... So so smooth. I never had an Americano so smooth before. Hubby coffee is also excellent, it just the Americano is a tad better.  Lastly, customer service is excellent... Decor is farm house rustic... Love it.

Potatoes look/taste like the frozen ones from Safeway, sad looking portions yet paying the same as before when the food was way better and you got larger portions, and my boyfriend and I never see the owner around anymore. Just sad to see this place go downhill and lose quality. Used to be one of my fav spots.",

It gets busy and the day I went it was apparently clear that they were under staffed. Sat at the breakfast bar giving me access to look down the line and see the amazing food headed out.  Green chili pork was spot on!! Lots of pork just enough spice. However only got one egg instead of two asked for over hard got over easy.  Egg sandwich was amazing! The bacon was 5 Star!!from what I could see going out the avocado toast is unreal! Even the berry and granola looks amazingly good. Personally not a fan of there chosen coffee company so skipped that.... Great job all the way around so I will be back for some hash.",

We ordered egg white omelette with veggies , side fruit plate and avacado smash toast. Omelette had Arizonan touch to it which was deliciously different. Avacado smash had buttery toast , fresh avacado smash and right amount of cheese. Oh Arizona I love your pampering. Definitely worth a visit for brunch or breakfast if you are around this area! Thank you for the amazing hospitality Cafe Smith!!",

Modern decor, make sure you take note of the awesome wood counter. Service has always been great. And the food is fantastic!!! I've had mostly breakfast dishes there and never been disappointed. Everything is good but I'm particularly partial to their breakfast burrito. Just about big enough for 2 breakfasts! Finally had a lunch sandwich for the burst time today. Tried the Chook sandwich and it was equally as delicious as the breakfast food. Highly recommend stopping by here!",

    "text": "Wow - what a great new breakfast place!  We stopped in this morning and luckily grabbed two immediate seats at the bar.  The staff was so friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere was lively and comfortable all at the same time.  We quickly figured out that the owners also have Base Pizzeria just a little north of the Smith - another great place, so we knew we were in for a treat.  My husband ordered the hungry man platter and I ordered the Queen Mother...such a ridiculous amount of food, but they had me at roasted tomatoes and baked beans.  It also came with two cage free eggs, bacon, Schreiner's sausage, grilled mushrooms, breakfast potatoes, and sourdough toast with strawberry jam - yummy!  We will definitely be back - loved it!",

He loved it and said it was the perfect amount of spice and the dish had great flavor combinations.",

Breakfast burrito was tasty with crispy potatoes, bacon and egg, but dry and needed another sauce maybe? The spicy sauce on the side that came with it was a bit too spicy. Food and service is solid 4 stars! Manager here is friendly, just like at Base Pizza. Great family owned vibe that Arcadians love!   Reason for 3 stars is that the kitchen is open, so you leave smelling bacon grease in your hair and clothes. Glad they have a patio, that will be better once weather cools down. Hopefully they can get some ventilation going or close off the kitchen. Also the menu is missing a standard veggie omelette and pancakes.",

The corned beef hash is very good, the house hash potatoes were somewhat hard and cold in the middle.  The corned beef dish comes with one egg & a lot of hash- really needing that 2nd egg. Plus toast is an extra cost as is substituting a side of tomato for the potatoes. Service friendly and it's a sit down table service which is nice; however higher prices too. Miss the casual easy going breakfast of the former cafe. We miss Mike.",

I ordered a breakfast sandwich after eyeing another diner's meal, and while I wasn't blown away, it was a very generous portion.. I ended up saving half for later, as did another friend with his meal, so they definitely have decent to larger servings :)  I took off a star because it is a 30min drive for me to come here, and I don't think I'd make the drive again just for this restaurant. Also, I ordered regular iced coffee, and they don't offer refills (or let you know beforehand about this policy) -not a big deal, but I didn't really think it was worth $4 per glass :/   If you're in the area though, I guess I'd give them a try..

I will say that I've only had one dish that I wouldn't get again. That being the Nobel French Toast, which I wrote about in my initial review. I just wanted to try them out, but I'm more of a savory breakfast person which is the only reason why I wouldn't get them again. If you are more into sweet breakfast then I would recommend the french toast. I've had many of their different specials and they are always satisfying. So far my favorite menu item has been The Reaper Scramble. WARNING: it is very spicy, but also very goooood",

So we went to early church service and came here right before the crowd. First let me say it's super cute and intimate. The staff was friendly. I ordered the green chili bowl which was slow cooked pork, green chili sauce, over easy  with cilantro, cotilla and tortilla. If I'm not mistaking, the waitress said this pork is cooked close to 20 hours (don't remember the exact number), but when I say it's evident! The heartiness of this pork was like nothing I'd had in a while. Hubby ordered the hungry man platter, a plate with 3 eggs, sausage link, bacon , toast and country . And while he said it was good, he'd for sure try something else when we return as there was nothing special about the fish/  Overall I'd highly recommend you dining here. The service is quick. Smiling faces greet you at the door and you won't be disappointed with your meal!",

    "text": "3on Smith Cafe is kind of forgettable. In fact, I did forget about it. On Sunday, a friend and I were looking to try a place new for breakfast and after a quick Yelp search, I suggested 3on Smith Cafe. It wasn't until we pulled up to the cafe that I remembered I have been here before. The last time I came in, I had the green chili bowl, which is green chili pork with an egg and tortillas. This time, I opted for the avocado toast and I added two poached eggs. I will say this is one of the biggest avocado toast I have had; it's 2 full slices of bread, each cut and half, and plenty of avocado. But it was quite bland. I added salt, pepper, lemon, and hot sauce to the toast and it still wasn't super flavorful.   I felt like the server was kind of rushing us. I'm not sure why because there was plenty of empty tables. He brought the bill before I had finished my breakfast. And when I asked for more coffee, he was quick to suggest a to go cup.   It's a bit pricy...with the toast, two eggs, and coffee, my bill came to $20. Oh and if you're a mimosa fan with your breakfast, skip 3on Smith, they do not serve alcohol.",

    "text": "This is based solely on service for a to-go order. Called in 2 items for pick up. They told me on the phone they were super busy so it would be 40 minutes. Figured I'd give them some extra time since restaurants typically undersell the wait time on to-go orders. So I arrived after 50 mins. I don't think they started my order until I arrived because I've been standing here for 30 minutes waiting on the 2 items I ordered well over an hour ago. At this point I don't care if the food is good or not. This service is atrocious. In hindsight I wish I didn't pay as soon as I arrived because I would not have left a tip had I known how long I'd be standing there. Hopefully the whole tip amount goes to the guy who offered me a coffee after standing there for 20 minutes since that was the only bit of service I received.  Update: I just got home with the food (I live a block away) and somehow the food is cold. One would think the food would be hot and fresh after waiting so long for it.",

    "text": "3on Smith Cafe has become our favorite breakfast spot in the valley.   Everyone's go to dish is the delicious The Reaper Scramble. It has Schreiner's chorizo (Anything from Schreiner's is good), charred onions, potatoes and spinach. It is usually topped with Carolina reaper oil which I choose to have on the side so the dish isn't overwhelmingly spicy. I kind of wish they would use red potatoes but this dish is amazing nonetheless.   Apart from the Reaper Scramble, another go to of mine is The Smith Hash. I love the corned beef with the roasted green chilies. I don't typically eat corned beef for breakfast but this dish is an exception. I always request mine to be extra crispy so that the corned beef is a tiny bit charred. Sometimes, I would order the kid's french toast ($5.50 - Noble Frenchie toast with one slice instead of two) which honestly has grown on me. I didn't think it was special the first time I had it but now I truly enjoy it. I find that it is not extremely sweet which I like and the berries they put on top along with the creme fraiche (?) are addicting.   Other dishes that I have tried in the past that you can't go wrong with: The Avo Smash, The Arizona BLT, THE CORNY COW (my boyfriend swears it's the best sandwich he's ever had). I have had a side of their beans and they're so addicting.  Their drip coffee is delicious and of course the service has always been top notch. We love this restaurant and will always be regulars.",

Seats and tables are comfortable and they don't have loud music playing (like many of the new trendy places) which was great because we could actually talk :-) The service was excellent. Our server was very friendly and polite. He kept checking on us. Great service! The coffee was delicious and strong- from a local coffee roaster-our server explained. I really liked that they have wooden sticks to stir your coffee- versus those plastic ones that are so bad for the environment. We ordered an omelette and French toast. They were both delicious and perfectly cooked. Every single ingredient was of excellent quality including the butter and oils used to cook (you can taste it). The potatoes had rosemary in them- which I really like. This will be our new breakfast place! Congratulations to the owners of having such a great restaurant with high quality food!",

Driven by the place a million times but the only thing that stands out on this strip mall is the oversized dry cleaner signage.   One thing that is certain is this breakfast diner, if you want to call it a diner, the food completely stands out! Bacon cooked to perfection, coffee flavor on point, and the chef special which consisted of Cali chipotle Benedict was outstanding.   It's really an upscale breakfast eatery not a diner. The decor is higher end and menu is original not like your typical breakfast joint.   I think they may serve lunch but I didn't go beyond the breakfast menu. I'll be eating here at least once a week! And btw...say hi to the owners/chef, top notch folks!",

It is not only massive, but packed full of delicious goodies like potatoes, eggs, bacon, and cheese with a homemade green salsa on the side. I'm pretty sure it weighs 10lbs so I could only finish half of it. I did contemplate suffering a serious food coma and eating it all because I didn't want to stop. I don't even have words to describe how good it is - you just have to see for yourself!  The service is super friendly, cozy ambiance, and I just love it. I will be back soon!",

The food was delicious.   Today we went for breakfast and I'd barely give it 2 stars. The waitress acted as though we were doing her a favor being there. She wasn't friendly nor helpful. We ordered. My omelet was delicious but my daughters waffle was so tough I needed a steak knife to cut it. It hurt her mouth to chew it so she ended up eating my omelet instead. My husbands breakfast came with a pile of undercooked bacon.   When the waitress brought our food she asked USF we needed anything. We had to ask for butter and syrup for the waffle. The butter was rock solid. Also asked for jam, which she brought.   The kids meal doesn't include a drink so tack in $3 for lemonade.   I'll definitely give it another try. I think today may have been a fluke and if we have a happier server it may change the experience.",

I ordered the Green Chile which was rich in flavors, packed with tender chunks of pork, and topped with a egg over easy. This is definitely shareable but you won't be able to.

I did like that they offered turkey bacon as an option.  We Ordered a mocha, the French toast and waffle and a side of sausage.  The French toast was really good, the blueberries weren't fresh so that was a downside, they reminded me of the canned Maine blueberries you get in the boxed Blueberry muffin mix from the store.  Had high hopes for the Waffle but it was so dense and chewy, and not crispy, almost like it was made way earlier in the morning then preheated or possibly made on a waffle iron that wasn't hot enough.  The service was great I have to say, The mocha was good too but extremely small.",

I would definitely order this again. To go along with that i ordered the avocado toast... the bread that came with compliment it very nicely! We will definitely be coming back in the near future!   Only negative remark - is that our waiter could have been more friendly and upbeat, not saying he was bad.

A brunch place without an amazing coffee ain't a good brunch place in my opinion.  2)  They have a pretty extensive unique menu for breakfast/brunch.  I ordered the Green Chilli bowl ($14) - Slow cooked pork, green chilli sauce, over easy egg, cotija, cilantro & pepitas with tortilla  It sounds like a lot is going on, right?  When I received the dish, I was shocked at how much pork meat it had.  Underneath the green sauce, there was so much meat that it was probably enough for two people to share.  If you are a heavy meat eater, go for it.  Really tender cooked pork pieces are drenched in delicious green chilli sauce.  My egg was perfectly cooked and tasted delicious with the meat.    It might be a bit too heavy for some people though considering it is for brunch.  I don't know how many people could finish the entire serving.  I kinda wish they gave us a smaller portion and mixed it with some other healthier veggie choices.  Excellent friendly service.",

    "text": "Decent food, spotty service  Not Recommended (read on...)  I was brunching today with friends, and we decided to visit 3on Smith Cafe, which we'd done several times. (I'm \"Duke\" of this place...) We arrived around 12:30 PM, and surprisingly the place wasn't crowed at all.  Food: There aren't many low-carb options here. I ordered the Green Cilli Bowl, which was very tasty. The pork was tender and flavorful, and the green chili sauce paired nicely. The egg was also a nice touch, along with pipits and a bit of cotija cheese.  I told the server, Adriel, that I needed to stay low-carb, and asked what I could substitute for the tortilla. He suggested several different breads, or a fruit cup. After I explained these options also had lots of carbs, he sort of gave up suggesting, and pointed to the \"sides\" on the menu. I decided to go with the sauteed mushrooms, which were good and not over-cooked.  Atmosphere: 3on Smith has a bit of personality, which is nice. The music can sometimes be a bit overbearing though.  Cost: A bit pricey at $14 for the Green Cilli Bowl.   But the surprise was the added $3 for the sauteed mushrooms! When I asked for a low-carb substitute for the tortilla, at no time did Adriel mention there would be an additional charge.  Service:  We were there for an hour and a half, and they never once stopped by to ask if I wanted my water refilled (I did).  When I got the bill, I asked the server about the added $3. He handed off to the manager, who explained the mushrooms cost more than the tortilla - which I totally understand. The issue is they never said there would be an additional charge for the \"substitution\". The manager dropped $1 off the price, which wasn't a resounding acknowledgement that maybe they should have handled this differently.  Overall: With so many other great places for brunch on the weekend I'm giving 3on Smith a \"pass\" for a while.",

I ordered the smith hash and my gf ordered the special, which was sourdough toast with some sort of sweet pumpkin sauce, powdered sugar and cinnamon I believe.  Both of these dishes were great. I liked that the smith hash dish was not that oily or salty. The special pumpkin sauce toast was delicious as well, not too sweet.   Service was quick and friendly. I would recommend coming to this place if you're in the mood for breakfast food.",

Very hip inside. The staff is always so friendly and you can see the cooks right there making your food. Now, I am not one to splurge on breakfast, but I am so glad I did. You can not go wrong with the queens breakfast. It's the most tasty English breakfast! Savory mushrooms that melt in your mouth. Delicious bakes beans, sausage and bacon. The herbed breakfast potatoes are also wonderful. And if you get lucky, I swear I got homemade sough dough bread one of the times I went in. Enjoy!!!",

My wife, brother and I had the green chili pork bowl, the breakfast burrito, and the avocado toast. We had a great conversation with the owner, who also owns Base Pizzeria. This is a huge upgrade to Acacia Cafe - better food and a better vibe. If you're expecting this to be like Acacia, you'll want to go somewhere else. This is modern and higher quality.  Oh, and if you're one of the people who is mad at Pita Jungle for getting rid of Passport Iced Tea - be angry no more - just go to The Smith and get Passport Tea there along with better food.",

At $15 for the Hungryman's breakfast, I'm convinced this is the deal of the century for AZ brunch. They aren't kidding when they say \"mountain of bacon\"--- and it's top notch bacon to boot. Sausage was phenomenal, and the poached eggs were some of the best we'd had. The potatoes weren't much to write home about, but that's partially because everything else stole the show. The Green Chili bowl was good too- but could have used a little more heat. All in all I would HIGHLY recommend. Enjoy!",

We discussed the intricacies of baked beans with one of the owners - American BB are sweetened while British are not.  Apparently The Smith went with baked beans canned in Ireland that have a little sugar in them in order to be closer to the American palate.  I would like to voice my support for British baked beans - 100% savory and no sugar :-)  Both items were delicious and the portions plentiful.  The service was very friendly.  We sat out on the patio, which continues to be dog friendly (the last establishment at this location also had a dog friendly policy).  The kitchen was a little slow to get the food out but not terribly slow.  The tables along the wall on the patio are arranged such that you will sit facing the wall, or with your back to the wall.  While this allowed for more customers, it also meant that if you want both parties to be in the shade (in early May) you should plan to finish your meal by 11.   As you can see by the rating we very much enjoyed our meal and will definitely be back.",

The menu was inclusive to our eating preferences but honestly the vegan plate was too green. It was healthy with the broccolini, spinach and mushroom but please, add a starch to make it filling. My husband ate 2 orders and left hungry. I ate an egg white omelette which was good but the home fries tasted like rosemary with rosemary and more rosemary. The winning dish was the green chile roasted pork. It looked amazing and per Val, it tasted even better! However it wasn't spicy as advertised on the menu.  The service was good, the coffee was good, the outdoor seating was nice.  I would go back. But next time I'd ask for a few substitutions to have the perfect meal. Home fries on the vegan plate (no rosemary), and ask for the avocado mash with cilantro, lime and salt for a guac feel. Pepitas are on everything and I liked it :)",

    "text": "Ended up at The Smith with my four kids while my wife was out of town on a girl's trip. It was busy, which is a good sign, but the wait wasn't to bad. We squeezed into a booth and after a seat switch got comfortable and perused the menu.  Kid number one order the Hungryman Breakfast. This was a plate of food that could have been split three or four ways. Really. Three eggs. A pile of sausage and bacon. Big pile of small cubed potatoes. Toast. And he ate it all. How it goes for a teenager. He gave it a big thumbs up, but now is in a food coma.  Kid number two ordered the Arcadia Sunrise, which is a burrito. It had egg, bacon, cheese and potatoes and was split into two big pieces. He ate half and said it was good, especially with a small dip into some ketchup.  Kid number three ordered the BYO Omelet with onions and spinach. She liked it, but thought too much spinach and not enough onions. Came with lots of potatoes too.  Kid number four order the Jr Noble French Toast. He really liked it and ate the whole serving. He is a super picky eater so that equates to a good review from an 8 year old.  I ordered the B&E Roll, which is a tasty breakfast sandwich. I did it without the bacon. I know, so un-American. Deal with it. And it still was good. Egg, cheese and pickled onions on a pretzel roll with potatoes.   Good breakfast has seemed to get pricey, but The Smith was no more expensive than similar breakfast places.   All in all we would go back!",

I've eaten here at least a dozen times and I usually get one of two things - the green chile pork or the smith hash. Both are fantastic and I struggle with the decision each time. The pork has some spice that will vary in its intensity from time to time, but my fiance (who doesn't do well with spicy) still orders it so it can't be that bad for those of you on the fence with spicy food. Service is always top notch and I can't recommend this place enough.",

At first glance the ambiance was hipster and the staff was friendly. You order and pay when you walk in the door.  We ordered the hungryman breakfast for me and the tuna special sandwich for my wife. The breakfast did take some time to prepare and looked and tasted good but didn't seem to be enough on the plate to warrant $17 price tag. I did try the wife's sandwich and it was just average.   When I left I still was hungry and felt a little taken. The food was good but just felt that I overpaid for what I ordered. I knew that I could have gotten the same quality and better for less money so the value was not there for me.   Still I would recommend trying the Smith. The breakfast was good but still not sure what all the hype was about.",

The cafe is run by Aussies with a \"Brekkie\" section of the menu that seems notorious for their flavorful twists on breakfast concoctions. I've been stalking them on Instagram and it looks like they kill it at their specials; walking in I was excited to hear what they have in current rotation, especially since they released a chorizo breakfast sandwich that's more than drool worthy, a few months back. The special did not disappoint! Dubbed the \"Dr. Seuss Burrito\", this whimsical beast of a burrito was chock full of eggs, potatoes, green chili pork, provolone - and topped with salsa verde and queso cotista. And the size?! This is where the term \"burrito baby\" originated. Here. This is where they make 'em! On top of this burrito baby, I also ordered a Chai Latte. (How my stomach didn't explode is still a mystery).They get their coffee supplied by Passport coffee, and I  indulged in that cup of Joe, sipping while writing down in my journal for a while. That's how you know it's good. Great ambience, great food, great lattes? Holy cow I'm in love.",

I've had it every time and I can't bring myself to get anything else. The bread is so fresh, the chicken is so tender, and the chipotle aioli has the perfect amount of kick without being spicy.   The same waitress is always there. I believe her name is Roberta. She is so kind and attentive and has the best attitude!!!!  It's a tad pricey, but great food, great service, great atmosphere!!!!",

I'm a huge fan of brunch (I think it's the most important meal of the day) and I was pleasantly surprised to find that this place has an amazing brunch!   I ordered the avocado toast. As an avid avocado enthusiast, I was impressed with the flavors and presentation. My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which was good, when it was finally brought out (details below). The Smith has a lot of healthy options which is always a refreshing break from the Oreo-Red-Velvet-Caramel-Sugar-Pankcake places.   Only reason for not 4-5 stars was the service - not sure if it was just an off day, but my waiter/kitchen got my friends order wrong twice, and on the third time it was brought out cold. I totally understand that things happen, it's just that no one offered an apology or even acted like anything was wrong, and the waiter actually seemed annoyed with us for trying to get the correct order brought to our table. Hopefully next time it will be better!",

I didn't expect really nice staff that were joking with each other as the brunch rush started, the cute decor, or a plate of food bigger than my head!  And it wasn't even the biggest!  I never understood the difference between an American breakfast and breakfast from the U.K./Australia. I do now. Roasted tomatoes and mushrooms might sound weird, but trust me it's worth it! I thought I was in the mood for a big breakfast, but I have to take some home. When they say a mountain of bacon, believe me they mean it! I had the Queen's Plate (sans the beans cause I'm a wimp), and I wound up taking most of it home.   They even indulged (and maybe understood?) my sometimes absurd tea needs, and had a wonderful collection to choose from.  The Smith has definitely earned a repeat customer, and I can't wait to bring my parents here next time they visit!",

This place is COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED into great food and a fun atmosphere.   I was first introduced to Rosco through his other restaurant Base on Lincoln and 32nd. After my 10th time there he told me they were taking this place over and I was ecstatic. I've been around 5 times now and everything I've had is great. FYI - I don't check in at every place I go cause that would be super weird to me.   I recommend the Reaper Scramble, Green Chili Bowl, and the Chook. Since I've lived in the southwest for a long time, the food isn't as spicy as some places so don't worry. If you do want some extra heat, use \"The Smith Oils\" they have next to the back door.   Awesome pace and I'm really happy they are in Arcadia. Thanks guys.",

So I asked my friends to try it just to see if they have different opinion on my hot and spicy order and they we're dissapointed as well.

Homemade corned beef? Done.   French toast with Noble bread. It's here.   Not just breakfast, either. They have a very competent sandwich board also, on homemade sourdough bread.   Come in so you can say you've been here before the line is around the building.

Our wonderful server, Chase offered a sample of the soup since I was not familiar with it.  I was hooked!  I eventually asked to speak to the chef, Jose because I wanted to know how often it might be on the menu, etc.  Jose explained that it was a family recipe & that his soups would be available for 1 week & then a new one would be presented. I believe he called it \"Pepitas\". It had s tomato base with ground nuts (pepitas plus other nuts?). It also had delicious chorizo meatballs and was perfectly spiced with just the right amount of kick. I've been to the Smith several other times for brekkie & that would have had me coming back anyway, but now there's Jose's SOUP!  I'll be back this week to get more of the Pepitas & then I'll have to show up at least once per week thereafter, as I have no intention of missing out on Jose's next soup masterpiece!  And PS. How refreshing to have delightful time with Chase & Jose going above and beyond to make our visit unforgettable!",

    "text": "We were disappointed to find that our favorites, lox and bagels and eggs Benedict,  were not on the menu.  Neither was the yummy tuna salad sandwich or the spinach salad.  I realize that new places want to update and offer new items, but many Acacia patrons went  there for our old favorites.  I wasn't attracted to any of the new items, so I ended up having eggs which were okay.  The person with me, who was disappointed there was no lox and bagel, had a sandwich.  She said it was okay.  I may call now and they to see if the menu changes, If not, I probably won't be going there as often as I did.",
