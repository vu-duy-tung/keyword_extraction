Thai Greece curry vegetable came with Bok Choy, broccoli, jalapeno, carrots, Napa cabbage, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, green beans, and baby corn in coconut sauce. Veggie lovers dream!  Told them I didn't need/want the rice and they threw an egg roll in just because. I think that speaks a lot about how unrude these folks are.  Thanks for being awesome.",

All their entrees have a rich and delicious flavor.   The combination of spices used here seem to be a little better than most other Thai restaurants.   It is a little drive from my house, but definitely worth it.   It is also located near the light rail line.",

    "text": "Best Thai In The Valley!!  A friend of mine had been raving to me about this place for years. I finally visited it in April, and then again yesterday.   My April visit was a really nice experience. The servers was helpful with suggestions and explanations of the food. I couldn't recall my friends recommendations, but tried #26, Chicken (choice of meats) stir-fried with fresh chili peppers, onions and bamboo shoots, which I had mildly spicy. It was delicious, and I left with every intention of returning soon, however a car crashing into their building caused them to close down for several months. Bummer.  Well, I finally got back there armed with my friend's recommendations. My server was very familiar with my friend, and recited off to me as his favorites, the same recommendations he had given me. I took that as a good sign, and it was. This time I had #36 Eggplant stir-fried with chili, onions, carrots and mushrooms with chicken (choice of meats). We settled on medium heat this time, which is how the server told me that my friend orders it.  It was spectacular! I had never had Asian eggplant before! I have no idea exactly how they cooked the eggplant, but it was juicy and full of the flavor of the sauce. I found myself favoring it over all of the ingredients in the dish.   The sauce was savory with all sorts of notes that I couldn't identify, but loved. I believe it had a healthy dose of Thai basil, a nice bite, a wonderful rich body, and a wonderful dose of garlic. All of the ingredients combined so nicely, I nearly hurt myself trying to finish the entire dish. In the end, I had a healthy amount to take home for later.   Based on the heat of the dish, I decided that a scoop of coconut ice cream was in order. It too was delicious.   My server came back to my table often to chat and to check on my progress. It was one of the most delightful meals that I can recall. In addition to my left-overs, I took home an order of #15 Tohm Yahm Goong - a zesty hot and sour shrimp soup with lemon grass and fresh mushrooms.  I have eaten Thai at several locations in the valley, and this was by far the best. I already know what I am having on my next visit!!!",

The reason for my 2 stars is because it's way busy for only 3 people long wait for appetizer and entree and to be seated  They didn't offer refills and kept walking by us like if we weren't there. Finally we got up and asked for the menu for dessert and boxes to go. Asked what came in the crab fried rice and the guy with a smartass answer was like \"crab\". I don't know if I'll come back here customer service sucks. I'll stick to Thai basil next time. If they had more people helping out they wouldn't be so busy bussing tables and forgetting about their customers. So rude.",

Our family favorite is the yellow curried chicken in coconut milk with carrots and potatoes, but you also can't go wrong with the Thai barbecued chicken, the mango delight, the chicken satay, the flaming soup, or the pork wontons. We get double orders of the vegetarian egg rolls stuffed with carrots, cabbage, and glass noodles, and I can never get enough of the chicken-cabbage soup that only comes with the weekday lunch specials and doesn't appear on the menu. The coconut ice cream is made in-house and is phenomenal. Come during the week for lunch (it gets crowded, so come early) or for a leisurely weekend feast.

I've also had it when I've felt fine and it's the best!   I love their pork with garlic sauce- I don't usually eat pork as much as I prefer chicken or beef, but it tastes best with pork in my opinion, and the sauce is heavenly.   If you like crab, they have a really good crab fried rice, it's not the imitation crab either! It's the real deal.   Prices are comparable to many other Thai restaurants I've been to. No complaints!",

After receiving uncooked chicken skewers for my girlfriend, they were re-ordered and returned the same uncooked way.  the waitress was rude and I will not be returning.  Plus, they are understaffed and if you need something you won't get it. You'll just wait and look around, waving at them and they will ignore you.  better Thai place on 7th avenue, south of indian school on the east side of the road!!",

When i told the waitress that we couldn't even drink water without hitting each others elbows she suggested that my 11 year old sit on my lap so we could have more space. After telling her that either we get a bigger booth (which was available) or we would leave she very rudely pointed to me that we could sit wherever we wanted. So after about 10 minutes of settling down at our new table she comes over to take our drink order. I have a 18 month old boy. to try and have him avoid crying or yelling i was entertaining him with a couple of sugar packets, which i was going to use for my iced tea anyways. she comes over and tells me to please stop playing around as \"those aren't toys\". i asked her how much a pack of sugar would cost so i could just buy it from her. she stated that they don't sell them. the food was decent but the service is one of the worst I've ever had. also, they don't state anywhere that there is a mandatory gratuity fee for party's of 6 or more but i was still charged for it. when i asked the manager she stated that that is common practice. i told her that i agree but that it has to be announced somewhere. never again...",

We ordered wonton soup which looked amazing but unfortunately tasted overly salty and greasy. Also got the angel wings which we should have ordered more of that because it was the only thing flavorably good. Thai iced tea was ok but yeah we had to dilute both it and the soup to make it more palatable. They should probably discontinue delivery takeout cuz it seems to lose something in the delivery (pricey & portions) . Thai delivery can be done right- Los Angeles has it down with TG Express if you're ever staying at a hotel in downtown area - if only a Phoenix Thai place would take a lesson and follow. There'd be bookoo bucks to be made.",

They used to put slivers of lime leaves in the sweet, rich panang curry which made it really good. Often now they leave them out- I think maybe the chef changed. I also enjoy the mussaman stew. Another recommendation would be the yahm pla meug (squid salad). I can't comment on the noodle dishes as I'm not really into those and haven't tried any. The thai iced tea is good.

I'm new to Thai, so I don't remember the names of everything we ordered, but there was this almost Rice Krispy noodle dish with bits of deep-fried chicken and shrimp in it. It was sweet, crispy, and delicious. We had Pad Thai, which I've liked at other places, but here the noodles weren't firm enough for my liking. We had some deep friend shrimp which are hard to mess up, and Thai Rama didn't. Oh, and there's a deep fried vegetable dish...the yams or sweet potatoes are delicious! The spice and flavor on most of the food was good. They have this amazing iced coffee drink with heavy cream on the top, and it is absolutely fabulous! I'd probably go back.",

It could just be a promo poster from a vendor. I don't know. And Bud Light signs. Ahhh...America! The Thai beer I enjoyed while waiting certainly helped pass the time. Service here is extrordaniarly friendly, like most Thai places I've encountered. I purposely over ordered as I wanted left overs. Pad Thai. Outstanding. After that I recommend numbers 1, 7, 23 and 27. Paint by number. Order by number. It's simple. And everyone's gonna love it. Thai Thai for now yelpers! P.S.

[Thai Basil, Thai Elephant, Wild Thaiger, even Thai Hut...] and your the only Thai restaurant in a 20 mile radius...you can last. but i shouldn't need to point out...that you have some serious competition in the area..and their prices are about the same.  i really wanted to make a funny review about this place. but lets face it.

But certainly it's not a Scottsdelish restaurant... if you want to enjoy everything else but food, I wont dare suggest this one's your place... but as far as food is concerned, its amazing ! ... All curries are very well prepared... Lunch is extremely cheap and comes with a bowl of soup, rolls, rice and a curry, which to me is more than sufficient for one... Dinner menu is also great and long enough to make you go and not try everything for a long long time... People are nice and not at all extra polite (I hate it when servers and managers are extra - artificially - polite... ! ) so that you feel like having food at a normal place...   A must go and an affordable place for people who eat out often....",

The Pad Thai is bizarrely sweet, like almost some sort of off-brand honey BBQ.  That isn't exactly the flavor, but that is what it made me think of.  Everything else, both Green and Yellow curries, as well as assorted rice and vegetable dishes just tasted bland and like they were using second-tier produce.

Everything from yoga instructors to military to foreigners to Texans. It is fun to people watch here.   I'm giving Thai Rama 4 stars based on their lunch specials. However I might lower it a bit for dinner. Thai Rama in Chandler is better. Touch of Thai in Glendale is by far my favorite Thai restaurant in the Phoenix area.   #3 is good. Yellow curry with potatoes, carrots, chicken and coconut based curry stew. Is #3 in Thai restaurant the universal code for this dish? It seems every restaurant I have been to has #3 listed as Yellow Curry. We always ask them to leave out the onions here.  If you don't be prepared with an aresenal of Altoid mints - especially if you are heading to work after lunch! They put a whole onion in the dish - it seems like it anyway.  The Pad Thai is good with chicken and shrimp. The lunch special version of Pad Thai is just under $10 however it doesn't come with the yummy crispy eggroll and crunchy goods on the side like the sister restaurant in Chandler. However the portion of Pad Thai is huge and flavorful. I boxed up the other half and ate it the next day.  The glass noodles with chicken was okay however had a bit too much fish sauce. Eggrolls are good and taste fresh and appear to be made to order.   The service is okay. Watching the patrons and the train passing is better.",

I like it but will try Touch of Thai next.",

Do the chicken stir fry with peanut dipping sauce, do the Thai tea with cream, watch out cause its sweet, I personally love the yellow curry with carrots and potatoes and I do hot, but its pretty much super spicy, so careful.  Very nice experience, not too pricey and if your one of the those lucky people who don't work 9-5's M-F, do their lunch special, you get hot tea, a cup of soup, a lunch meal which comes with rice, a fried spring roll and crunchy wontons.",

A few friends suggested this place, and so we headed over there.   Thai Rama is a pretty casual joint - it seems like it used to be a Sizzler or something else in a previous incarnation. But the food is pretty good, and when I told them to make my dish spicy they actually listened and complied, so they get props for that. Good-sized portions as well, so you're getting your money's worth. The atmosphere may not be as nice as some other That restaurants, but the place is still clean and in the end, it's all about the food, right? It also seems like a popular place for local folks to order their food to go.  I'm hoping the 3 stars are accurate and that my standards for Asian food haven't started slipping since I moved to Phoenix. But I'd say it's a very safe bet, if not a good one, for you to get your satay on.",

My friend and I ordered the egg rolls (sorry, I don't remember the Thai name), and they were okay. Two pieces, small (but the price was $2, so what did I expect?), and an average filling - something I would expect from frozen egg rolls.  We're both vegetarians and were happy to see a vegetarian section in the menu, but were slightly disappointed with the options. Three of the items included oyster sauce, and the other three were either vegetarian fried rice or red/green curry vegetables. I ordered the green curry vegetables (medium hot), and my friend ordered the red curry vegetables (mild - and she stressed MILD). We waited 20 minutes for our dinner to arrive. I didn't mind my dish - it was waaaaay spicier than medium, but I don't mind a little heat. The sauce was very runny, and the vegetables were soggy and looked they had been sitting in the sauce for quite a while. My friend didn't like her dish at all, mostly because it was quite spicy for being a mild dish. We spent $25 total, and I'm not sure it was worth it.  The service was slow, but the waitresses were very friendly. Overall, I would probably not recommend this restaurant to a friend.",

I really was hoping for a better dish.  Perhaps I need to try something they are more known for, like one of their curries.    Service was good.  Friendly when they took my order and when they gave me my food.    I guess I just need to try a different dish.  But pad-thai is one of my favorites and they didn't get it right.  Oh well.  Their curry reputation is reason to go back.  Hopefully an updated awaits.",

Pad thai with chicken... level 5 - 5 is usually med spice but to some ppl its very spicy... you can always lower the number to a 1 or 2 and it'll still be just as good. 3. Yellow pork or chicken coconut curry with potatoes, onions, carrots, & pineapple.... level 5 again.... my fave 4. There's one more beef dish that is absolutely delish! But, I forgot the name. Basically all it is, is thick rice noodles and thinly sliced beef stir fried.. Kind of like a chow fun but better!  Oh and I would also like to add that they have a very friendly waitstaff and pretty good service.  If you like Thai, check this place out!!!",

    "text": "Ok, so when I'm not eating cheese pizzas I'm eating Thai Food.  Much like pizza, Thai (or almost any Asian cuisine)  is something I could eat almost everyday and being a vegetarian Thai food has a lot of options for me.  Why am I telling you this?  Cause eating a lot of Thai food makes me picky.    Whenever I try any new Thai place I stick with one of two standards: Pad Thai or Green Curry.  If you are a Thai restaurant and cannot handle either of these dishes, then you should just close down shop now.  As for Thai Rama, they do both very well.  I'll even go as far as to say Thai Rama is my favorite Thai food in the valley.  It's near my home, open late and the staff is really friendly.    I've eaten here for years and my favorite is the Pad Thai with fried tofu....dare I say the best in the valley??  I prefer my Pad Thai a little on the sweet side, not fishy tasting with some flavor, and most Thai places here have the more \"traditional\" type.  If you like it spicy, this place can comply so watch out!  Their green veggie curry is flavorful, with a good assortment of veggies.    My only complaints would be their hot and sour soup, which is ok but WAY too much ginger flavor...to the point that I couldn't enjoy it.  Also, like so many other Thai places, they tempt you with the mango sticky rice only to never have mango!!!  When they do, its awesome, otherwise settle for the custard sticky rice which is almost as good.",

The interior of Thai Rama is not so attractive and I tried to look past that.  But the food couldn't save it.  Even the sauce you dip your eggrolls in there has an incredily weird texture and taste.  I got some kind of beef dish with medium spice level.  It was so strange and distasteful that I can't remember what it was even called.  There's no way I will ever go back, even though my kind friend paid for my dinner.  Thai Hut is right down the street.  Save yourself some money and enjoy better Thai there.",

The menu offers many interesting dishes including a soup served in a flaming bundt cake pan (OK so it isn't actually a bundt cake pan, but  I like to imagine it is). The soup is absolutely delicious, just don't eat the wood floating in it. For seasoning only. You can eat it if you want, just don't come crying to me when you have a mouth full of splinters.   I tried a coconut curry stew with chicken and potatoes. I couldn't stop eating it even after I was full. An incredible dish available in varying degrees of spiciness.  Might I also suggest you try an iced coffee? I'd have it with or for dessert though. It's so sweet and strong and good that I swore I could almost see through walls when I finished it.

I've had a few different dishes there, and they tended to be quite tasty without being Americanized.  That is, the flavors were there and not damped down for our native taste buds.    Some how we always ended up getting some yellow curry in there (one of my favorites in general), and this was just fine there.  The ambiance is pleasant and the people working there were always very nice.

I don't live very close to it so I've tried just about every Thai place around me and nothing compares so I always have to suck it up and make the drive, but it's so worth it. I'd eat their Pad Thai and crab puffs every day if I could. They are also very kind and when I would go every Sunday, they knew my order my heart and are always so accommodating.",

On to the food: Even after having Thai in San Fran this is still one of the best in the biz, flavor is on point and always leaves you wanting to come back form more.

    "text": "So this review is mostly based on the experience, not so much the food as I am admittingly not a huge Thai food fan.  My GF swears this is the best Thai food in Phoenix so I took her.  Now we did come at noon which is lunch time.  Parking lot has maybe 12 spaces and very tight.  If you have a nicer or bigger car, I'd reccommend parking on the street.  So we had a young lady serve us about 90% of the time.  She sat is, handed us menu's and walked away.  She brought us waters and walked away and never asked if we wanted anything else to drink.  About 10mins went by and she took our order.  Before I could get my drink order out she was gone again.  Finally I flagged her down and asked her for sodas.  My girlfriend said Coke or Pepsi.  We both got coke and I ordered Pepsi.  Fine no biggie.  My girlfriend ordered her normal 62 and it was amazing as always according to her.   I got the sweet & sour chicken and I must say it was pretty dang good.  Crispy breading and plenty of chicken.  I ordered some Wonton chips and she brought me back some deep fried stuffed wontons.  I figured whatever, I'll eat around the stuffing.  Girl never came back to check on us or refill us.   Finally an older lady came by and was awesome! She was so friendly and polite and actually explained the wonton they gave me on accident.  She made it right without being asked and was perfect.  She took my service experience from a 2 to a 3.  Maybe next time we can bump this up to 4 stars.  I'll give them a second round try soon.",

When I got it, it was so full of oyster sauce that the noodles were soggy and only had 2 shrimp and minimal chicken in it. The sauce was so overbearing and tasted burnt. It was more of a brown than red/orange pad Thai sauce. They charge extra for rice when you order curry and don't give much of it. Both times I was here, the cashier was behind less than friendly and even a bit rude. Would not recommend.",

I've gotten this twice from this location and I swear it has mushrooms in it even though the online menu doesn't list them. Beware the galangal in the soup. It's basically a type of ginger, but don't bite into it. It's just there for flavoring and they usually leave it in big square or rectangle chunks. I'm a garlic fan. Can never have enough so the gratiam prig thai is a go-to dish for me too. It's a meat in a spicy garlic sauce. I choose chicken and it's never been dried out or rubbery.",

The presentation in a flaming donut cauldron (not sure what the correct name is, and too lazy to ask the Internet) is cool, and the soup stays nice and hot.  I like to get a side of rice for my soup too.  The crispy won ton appetizer is also good, but I've managed to avoid the temptation of ordering other delicious sounding items (like the $12 shrimp tempura special I almost fell for today), since I knew I'd have leftovers from my soup once it was bulked up with rice.  They've had a full remodel since the car crashed into their restaurant.  The flooring is kind of ugly (it's that industrial-looking gray tile that Costco sells), and the wall decor is meh, but I like the tables and booths.  Dinging them one star for the obnoxious 3% credit card processing fee they're passing on to their customers.  At least my card gave me back 2% of the bill as cash back.  The tiny parking lot can also get crowded.  Note that their menu is markedly different from the Thai Rama in Chandler.  In addition, they have not cheaped out and are still using quality cloth napkins.",

Tempura green beans with a surprise of cilantro that delivers a good spin. The best silver noodles we have had; add a little broccoli for nice crunchiness. Get a Thai iced tea; you'll love it. Great, friendly staff who remembers us easily, and knows what we want or what to recommend. Drop by anytime and you will be glad you did.",

The owner was nice enough to come to our table just returning from Thailand with a delicious new coconut desert.  All the dishes are delicious and also vegitarian friendly.  Staff are always friendly and happy to see you return.  This establishment has been here for years and in a ever changing city like Phoenix that should say something. By far one of my favorites places to eat thai food.",

    "text": "l thought l was patronizing a Thai restaurant. However, this place is no where close to authentic or even good Thai food. l ordered the tom yum seafood combo, it's a sweet and sour seafood soup and l ordered a side of white rice.  My food was inedible.   Their tom yum was a poor amateur of the real deal, if you know Thai food and this dish you'll know what I'm getting at with the description of what l was served.  This dish only had the following:  two small shrimp, squid, unshelled mussels, jalapenos, ginger and thinly sliced button mushrooms.  The dish wasn't sweet or sour, it was however extremely salty, the seafood was overcooked big time and the side of white rice was gelatinous from too much water when it was cooked, the grains stuck together instead of being light and fluffy.   lt didn't have the typical additional ingredients of fresh thai chili, lemon grass, tamarind, mussels in the half shell, seafood cooked medium, fresh spiced tomatoes, chili flakes, fresh lime and other garnish toppings. It lacked greatly in presentation, taste and aroma.    Two others in my party where also disappointed in their dish too.    I'm not Thai, but am very familiar with the food and have made it myself a number of times. lt's just nice to have it elsewhere without having to do all the prep and other work involved in it.  Long wait time on average to be seated with our party and witnessed others waiting when it wasn't busy.  Sadly, l cannot recommend this place or return.",

During the hike we were dying and all we could think about was food. More than halfway through the hike, we decided to give up and grab lunch. We took a while to decide and ended up going here since it was nearby.   The building of this place is so cute. The decorations of the place made me feel homey. But... Let me tell you how it smell like when I walked in... IT SMELLED AMAZING!!! Whatever type of Jasmine rice this restaurant used, it smelled liked heaven.   In every Thai restaurant I go to, I must must have Thai milk tea. It just won't be right if you don't, ya know? I got a yellow curry from here (I always get curries). I got it at spicy and let me tell you, it was spicy but so good! So good! The portion was a good amount that I had leftovers to bring home. I was so full that I did not have any room for dessert :(",

Thai Rama makes a truly top shelf version of this delectable soup - you will savor at least seven discrete, wonderful flavors at once with every spoonful, including galanga, kaffir lime, cilantro, lemongrass, coconut, fresh chicken, and mushrooms. They make it from scratch in the traditional manner and you can really taste the difference.  Also worthy of note: the angel wings are crispy and delicious, and the Panang Curry has a beautiful flavor. Great service here as well.  Although we continue to try other Thai restaurants in the Valley, we always return to Thai Rama in Phoenix for the soup - no one else gets it quite right.   The only downside is that the Tempe location is not as good. Not sure why, but the food is noticeably different. It's a shame they do not have the full bar at the Camelback location, as that would make the restaurant perfect.",

There is a small parking lot, which might be a problem, should a lot of people show up. However, when we went, it was just around 1:30pm on a Friday and the parking lot was empty. (They close at 2pm.) Our party of four arrived just in time to grab lunch. I ordered the pad thai and my husband ordered the red curry. Our other two party members ordered the yellow curry, the larb, Tom Kha Gai soup, and some sort of kebab. The soup was amazing. Super flavorful and I would definitely order it again. I liked my pad thai, which comes with both shrimp and chicken, but I only had one shrimp in the entire dish. (It was mainly chicken.) My husband loved his curry and said it was the best curry he's ever eaten. Prior to our lunch being served, complimentary cabbage soup was served. Overall, the entire meal was very good. Our waitress was very nice, double checked our orders, and was very attentive. The inside seems decently decorated and had comfy booths. The bathroom needs improvement, but it was clean.",

I agree with some other reviewers who stated that the sauces seem watery, and the veggies seem canned. i had the yellow curry chicken. it's flavor was acceptable, but certainly not the best I've had. HOT was the spice level I requested, but disappointingly the spice level AND the food temp were somewhere around luke warm.  food = 2 stars service = 4 stars",

I'm usually in jeans on a date :P   walks me to the car... unlocks the door and walks around... doesn't even bother to open my door while I'm already there? O..K...   As soon as we start walking up to this place I'm automatically excited, i can smell all the good things from inside :)   the lighting is really calming and warm... we were seated right away.. it took a minute for them to get to us for our drink orders ... they had so many take out orders it was insane... so i figured it had to be good right?!   in the mean time i learned that my date is a vegetarian... well that's cool and all but somehow it turned into me defending my right to eat meat... i was really calm about it and just let it roll off but i was annoyed...   as soon as we ordered our food.. like the second the lady walked away he looked at me with the weirdest look ever and said \"Aren't you going to go and wash your hands?\" WTF!!!!!! like he expected me to just get up and make a dash for the restroom... do i look like I'm 6yo? \"um well dude... I'm sure we have some time... ill wait a little before i go and wash my hands... \" he continued to look at me like i was gross or something.... weird   he got a Thai beer and i got my usual water with extra lemon :) and the beer was really good... I'm not sure what its called but if you translate the title to English it means brother... (he igoogled it) it had a nice flavor... and its the same price as a soft drink lol score!   once we got our food i was soo excited! i got the sweet and sour chicken .. with steamed white rice... they had the pineapple, onions, green bell peppers and a new one for me... TOMATOES!! and it was delicious!! just amazing...  he had something vegetarian... with noodles and broccoli...   so the whole time throughout dinner he proceeded to laugh out loud with his mouth FULL of food... and talk really loud at me with his mouth still full of food... and i mean its about to fall out of his mouth... it almost ruined my dinner... to bad i was too focused on the bell peppers! mmmm   then he proceeded to pick food off his place and put it on my mine to try... which would have been cool... if he didn't use his HANDS to serve it... I'm glad to know he had just washed his hands but still... really?!?   once we were finished he got the check... then showed me and started bitching about it! it came to a total of $22 and some change... um two dinners plus a beer... man that's a great deal in my eyes... plus I've never had a date show me the bill before... isn't that like a man rule? hmm i thought it was... so he takes care of it and we leave... still with me opening all my own doors... :( and as the drive to the next destination he continued to belch out loud without covering his mouth or saying \"pardon me or excuse me\" or anything.... and kept talking about how he had to go to the bathroom ... i was horrified!   End Result....   Good Food... Nice and clean bathroom..the soap leaves your hands SUPER soft and touchable :)  The Service was nice...  Nice atmosphere...  Horrible date...  Wish i had had better company :(   oh and i Tossed out his number...",

Other Thai restaurants I've tried in the area don't even come close! I always get mine medium spicy. As another patron suggested, the level of heat can be somewhat inconsistent depending on who is preparing the food that night. If you are concerned by this, you can always order your food mild and ask for the spices to add yourself until you've reached your desired level of heat. The staff is always very friendly. We've been coming since 2008 so they know who we are and exactly what we want, including the level of heat!",

I am not a Thai connoisseur by any means trust. But I do enjoy a good Pad Thai every now and again. I went here a couple weeks ago with my Sis.  She got her Hot and Sour soup and for me Pad Thai. My mouth was watering just thinking about it.   Then it happened.... me so stupid brings me something that I did not order & didn't even come close to Pad Thai WTF??!!?? Wrong table. But maybe I should have kept it because what came next was unacceptable.  It looked tasty, smelled tasty but my tasty buds had to spit it out!  1st it was so hot I thought the cook (I do mean cook and not chef) from Ls Dos Molinos was moonlighting at Thai Rama. Holy Peppers batman this shit was hot! But served at room temperature go figure. The noodles were wayyyyyy over cooked they were paste and I am an al dente kinda girl. Al dente you know firm but tender anyway...  Off with you heads! They took it away and tried again, to my dismay I received a now flavorless dish with similar noodles. I think they made them in advance and are fishing them out as people ordered. BLUCK! PLTH wiping my tongue off.   Anyway this is not as I remember and I don't think I will go back unless someone else is buying. Tee Hee I only gave it a 3 star because my sis said her soup was delish as always. Again maybe the cook from Los is following me.",

The food came and everyone was happy. My only real complaint is that not one dish came out at the same time. I might be as bold to put a couple minutes in-between each plate so that there were 15 minutes in between the first and the last of the food arriving.

    "text": "Used to eat at Thai Rama back in the 1990's and always enjoyed the food. Then at some point in the mid 2000's they changed ownership or management;and for a while the food was so so.  I had not eaten their in many years. On New Years eve mysel and 2 friends decieded to give Thai Rama a try we were all very pleased the food was delicious and the portions were sufficent. With that experience, we have been back to Thai Rama several tmes. And its been consistently good. Wait staff is attentive, the seating and atmosphere is fine.   There's two things I've noticed since we started going to Thai Rama that could change and then it would be close to 5 stars. More vegetarian options., they do have a small section of vegetarian choices. Which is nice,being I'm vegetarian I'm always happy to see more vegetarian selections. And consistency with portions. Seems if you order two plates they make one of the orders normal portion size and the second order much smaller portion size. I've noticed this with consistency each and every time.  I don't understand why they do this. Perhaps I can chock it up to the fact that the waits staff are all very thin. So they are making your second dish small in order to enforce the Jenny Craig portion control on you. Ik really don't know. However when your payinf full price for the meal it should not make a dikfference even if its you 2nd 3rd or 4th dish. Portion size should be the same all the way around. Another thought I had was if your overweight which iam they short you on the portion size. The reason I say that is because my friends that have return with me to Thai Rama every time; their portions seem to be a reasonably good portion size. Not at all the smaller portion size I seem to be getting. Bla bla bla bla. I know I gone on for quite a bit about portion size..I'm going to try not to make this a contencious issueas it seems to be. Any suggestions as to hw to address some thing like this when your dinning at a restaurant you enjoy?  So if it weren't for the issues I've disscused I would definatley give Thai Rama 5 stars I will return delicious food, attentive wait staff. And reasonalbe prices.  (Don't forget they offer brown rice) ++",

The second time was about 10 months ago and the food was good but the service was not. I ordered a lunch menu item (at lunch time) and was brought the dinner portion. I mentioned to waitress that I was holding the lunch menu while ordering the lunch item and I was confused how the mix up happened. She said there was nothing she could do and I would be charged the dinner price. Not only charged the dinner price, but would not be getting the egg roll which came with the lunch item I ordered. She said she would bring an egg roll. Sure enough she charged for it on the bill. Not impressed. I shouldn't have to pay for a mistake that wasn't mine. But I did anyway and left.  I went for the third time a month ago and decided to skip any possible service mishaps and get take-out. The food was BAD. Not just mine, my husband's also.

Especially after visiting another Thai restaurant in the area last night and realizing it doesn't even come close in comparison.   From what I recall, the spice I recall from earlier visits was good but nothing spectacular and the dessert was fabulous. Since then, I've been a crazy regular at Thai Rama and it never fails, I'm craving their Thai specifically at least once a week. Usually for yellow chicken curry.  The prices are very reasonable and the dinner portion is enough to last me at least two meals. AT LEAST. The curry containers are a really sturdy plastic, which means they not only stay safe on the drive home, but they are reusable and recyclable.  And the heat people. Wow. Let me tell you, that it's on point. And then some. The heat is perfect. I am pretty tolerant, and love, a good amount of heat in my food. And medium here is usually the most I can handle. Any more, and I'm buying a gallon of milk for the meal too.  To Go orders are pretty quick, which is convenient and the staff is so friendly. I'm always offered water and a seat while I'm waiting.

Got the infamous trio I always get at a Thai restaurant: Tom yam goong, pad Thai, and green curry. All three were fails in my book. Since the flaming vessel they serve it in usually just keeps it warm rather than finish cooking it, we had a lukewarm soup with uncooked mushrooms and green onions. It was flavorful, but being lukewarm, fresh onions kept masking the flavor. Next, came the pad Thai. Too sweet and the noodles lacked definition. It was a big glob and they were really cheap with their proteins. Finally, the green curry came and it was very salty.   Will not return.",

Food is consistently fresh, of a higher quality than most other Thai places i have been to out here & they are very vegetarian friendly. Two warnings: if you ask for hot/spicy....it will be some of the spiciest food you have ever had, not a bad thing, just be aware. Second: weekends are extremely busy, dont come on a weekend with the entire restaurant packed full if you expect the staff to take as much time talking to you simply because they can't. Most of the negative reviews i have read have been about these issues so hope this helps for what its worth. Again, I highly recommend this place & always have a good experience here",

But, they sold and changed staff but, kept the name. I do not know why. Anyway, it went down hill very quickly. The new owners did not seem to get the concept of why this place was so popular. They do close for an entire month in the summer while the family goes back to Thai Land for holiday.  They were so bad for awhile I vowed never to go back. But since my girl lives over in that part of town I would cave and we would go. It is just like a lot of the other patrons have written. It is so hit and miss.  One day the food is great and the next time you go it is horrible.  The lunch specials are good. But the last 4 times I have gone they never have the soup. Do not advertise soup if you really do not have it.  Parking is tight so sometimes you have to park on the street.",

Have no fear though, they're just as courteous to new customers. They offer plenty of parking and accept take out orders.  Now for the food: they give generous portions at a low cost. Their fried rice comes in many styles with many meat options, I've had both the chicken and the pork and can say they're quite good. They also offer a large selection of curries, though my boyfriend has yet to find one that he likes. As far as heat levels go, this place definitely caters more to those with a more delecate palate. Even my usual go to of a level 3 was more sweet than it was spicy, and my boyfriend's level five was way more what I would consider a 3.   So it is a great place if you're more into Thai without all the heat, and they're even open on Sundays unlike most Thai restaruants in the Valley. The service is great and the portions are hardy, if the taste was more authentic then they would definitely be 5 stars.",

I almost wrote a letter to their management last time I bought carry out, because I was enormously disappointed when I'd brought an order of Shrimp Pad Thai home, a quite basic and expensive dish, only to find a basic gluten ball with hardly any veggies, and all of FOUR SHRIMP!  They did their usual great job of making Larb, but for a giant pile of rice noodles they sold me as Pad Thai?  SORRY, THAT AIN'T EVER HAPPENING AGAIN.  It's one thing when you dine in and have a chance to voice your dissatisfaction, but it's entirely different when you go to the trouble of picking up your order, just to get home and find you've been seriously ripped off.    I don't have the budget to have the luxury of eating out often, but when I'm wanting to treat myself to something good, and used to like a place like this, I can't see paying big bucks for what amounts to 25-cents worth of rice noodles and four shrimp.  Another reviewer said they changed hands and kept the name, I'd like to know when that happened because I think it may coincide with when they turned into the 'hit and miss'-type place they've obviously now become.  How basic IS Pad Thai anyway?  I lived in Thailand for several years, and I USED to like Thai Rama simply because they did a great job making meals that reminded me of why I fell in love with Thai food in the first place.  Two stars Thai Rama... Get your act together, and go back to when you were a reputable place to eat!  If you don't, a better, quality restaurant will take your place, like a Taco Bell! :-(",

Sometimes i'll get the bbq chicken which is hands down the most delicious  bbq ive ever had. Its sweet and tangy. And you get a half chicken. The price is inexpensive  with each dish costing around $7. I highly recommended.",

    "text": "I can't bring myself to give Thai Rama more than 3 stars... I love Thai food, and I wanted to love Thai Rama, but I just didn't.  I thought the restaurant itself was cute, casual, and unassuming... the staff was friendly but not the most attentive.  I was there on a Sunday night recently, and I felt extremely comfortable dining solo (big plus for that).  Unfortunately, when I was given my menu, there was a dried up noodle stuck to it, and the napkins on the tables are pretty but polyester and not the best for wiping the noodle off or absorbing anything at all for that matter.  I was also disappointed that I didn't see a thai salad with peanut dressing or summer rolls on the menu.    I decided to order the #6 to start - Lab Gai (finely chopped chicken lightly sauteed in lemon juice with red onion and mint).  Maybe I should've ordered it without onion because onion was everywhere!  The flavor of the chicken was good, but it was difficult to eat with so much onion.  I went with the vegetarian dish #69 (yes, I said 69) as my entree.  Paht Paug Jae or vegetable deluxe.  I requested that they add eggplant and they did - it was pretty tasty and I cleaned my plate with that one.  Overall, the meal was ok.  Maybe I'm spoiled by some other thai favorites in the valley, but I'm glad I experienced Thai Rama.  I probably will not rush back, but if you're looking for a decent thai meal and you're in the Cen Pho area, you can find it at Thai Rama.",

We live uptown and went to Yelp to look at local Thai options.   I ordered the Vegetarian Green Curry and a Thai Iced Coffee, and my boyfriend ordered the Yellow Chicken Curry with a Thai Iced Tea. I awaited our food apprehensively, hoping to not be disappointed with the outcome.  Boy was I in for a surprise! The Green Curry looked simple enough, with a huge pile of assorted veggies amidst a beautiful sea of green curry/coconut milk. I took my first bite and the flavor overwhelmed me. It was absolutely delicious! Savory, authentic, and absolutely amazing. This is a must stop for pretty much any ethnic-food-loving vegetarian out there! My conscience was at ease while my palate was swooning.  The decor is kind of traditional Thai, and I'm half-Asian so it reminded me of all the little mom-n-pop Thai diners growing up in California. There's even an adorable plush area hidden around in the back for groups - with comfy lavish pillows and a huge lazy susan in the middle of the table. Thanks Thai Rama - you've made me a happy ethnic vegetarian. xoxo",

    "text": "This place(not the one in Tempe or Chandler) is my favorite place to eat out of any option. I seriously don't think they know how damned great their food it. If they were to move to a new building and modernize the decor they could charge me twice the amount and I wouldn't even flinch. We go pretty much every Friday and hover around 5pm for them to open like stalkers outside some window. Over the 4 years I have been going to this place I have been able to try various dishes and here is my rating on each dish and overall dining experience.  Ambiance: 3/5 The place doesn't have the right flow if you were to visit you would see what I mean. The takeout area is in the middle and the wait to be seated area is around 6 feet from the door and I imagine some people might not be seated due to them not being noticed. The decor isn't much of a date place if you were trying to have the whole package of aesthetics and good food so don't come in thinking it's a Ticoz or Tuck Shop.  Service: 5/5 The best I have ever had, each person is lightning quick they are super friendly and the food comes out so fast it will make your head spin sometimes.  Food:  I don't know how to articulate how great it is.  72- 5/5 Vegetable fried rice with chicken medium spice 5/5 - This is the freshest most flavorful fried rice I have tasted. All the veggies are crisp and tasty. Just add a dash of soy sauce and it is perfection. This is the first thing I tried years ago and ordered repeatedly as well as my whole lunch party for years straight.  25 - 5/5 Chicken, onions, and peppers in medium spice sauce that must be made by the gods themselves it is so flavorful. My current favorite that I order it with extra chicken and extra sauce and it is the best thing I have ever had and is spot on each and every time.  11- 5/5 Thai Angel wings -I have had a few but by far the batter on these stands head and shoulders over any other. I always order these, drown them in the sauce it comes with and it's heavenly.  Beef Panang medium spice 4/5 I am not a curry fan or any thing with similar flavors,except here, they just know how to make brilliant dishes.  Yellow Curry medium spice 4/5 the default choice for most people into thai it seems but this is the first place I tasted it that I genuinely would crave it as I am not a fan of curry.  22-  4/5 chicken with oyster sauce and veggies with hot spice. This one was super one time then ok another time but still a solid dish. Usually a mild flavor so adding hot kicks it up. 29- 4/5 similar to above with cashews with hot spice. Really great also 40 - 4/5 with chicken instead of shrimp with hot spice  Pretty much every dish I have tried from Mango delight to their soups are great. I will mention the food in my own opinion that isn't their strong dishes so they don't ruin your first initial impression if you decide to order them. 3/5 bbq chicken 2/5 fried combination some veggies are good some aren't 2/5 thai toast 2/5 eggplant 2/5 pad thai personal preference though as I dont care peanut sauce 2/5 anything with duck  This review is specific to the Camelback location as the Tempe location started out great but lost a cook and multiple employees most likely due to a ego maniacal manager. That local does have an excellent building and decor and for a time identical food just in smaller portions but having two waitress/waiters for lunch rush lead to bad service and the cook change threw off the taste. I will state I haven't been back for over a year since finally writing it off after consecutive let downs so they may have remedied the issue. The Chandler one is in the family but they don't follow the recipes and do what they want with the dishes and is more of a take out place.",

Having just arrived in Phoenix with no plans on a lunch spot, a quick peek at Yelp resulted with this find. Was I in the mood to eat a bowl of heat in this scorching Arizona temperature? Sure, why not?   The atmosphere is casual and it was almost quiet after the lunch hour rush.   After navigating their extensive menu we decided on the following family style dishes:   Tom Yum Soup, House Fried Rice, BBQ Chicken, Stir Fried Beef with Green Beans and a side of steamed rice.   Although all of the entrees were good, nothing really stood out to me or left me wanting more. However, the Mango and Sweet Rice dessert was noteworthy and it wrapped up our meal nicely.   Service was friendly and attentive. Our server made time to chat with us whenever she came over to our table to deliver our food or to refill our drinks.  While this venue isn't a destination spot, it's definitely a favorite among the locals!",

After entering we were seated immediately. The server handed us the menu. Since this was our first time here, we decided to go with what we are familiar to be on the safe side. We ordered Crab Puffs as an appetizers, for our meal, my better half ordered the Chicken Fried Rice, and I ordered the Cashew Chicken, plus I wanted to try their Thai Iced Coffee.  The Crab Puffs came in a plate with the a sweet and sour sauce, and I know what you will say, big deal they are just Crab Puffs. Well let me tell, there are Crab Puffs, and there are these Crab Puffs. They were absolutely delicious.  The main courses come in a family style serving, so that all can partake from each plate. Both of us tried a portion from each other's order. We were very happy about the flavoring from each of our orders.  When the server came by to check on us, I almost hesitated but, I had to ask her how many years their restaurant had been in business. She didn't hesitate, to proudly tell us that they had been in business since 1993. She asked us how we liked our food, and my better half answered, \"that it was delicious and that we would return again\" By the way their Thai Iced Coffee is really good.  We were very pleased with Thai Rama, and they will have returned customers, that for sure.  Even if this place is along the Light Rail, give them a try, it make your tummy happy.",

    "text": "This is probably my favorite and the best Thai restaurant I've tried so far! My bf and I were in the area and for some reason we both wanted to eat Thai food.  The service is EXCELLENT!!! The waitress is super nice and friendly, she asked if we would like to have a drink first while looking at the menu, she didn't rush us to order the food!  I ordered Chicken pad thai (my favorite, lol) and my bf ordered Pineapple fried rice. The portion of the food is a lot though. I was really surprised with the Pad Thai, it was SO GOOD, yes I've had pad thai at another Thai restaurant but this one was THE BEST! The chicken was fresh, it's so sweet and also has a little bit of sour kick to it, it was so flavorful and for the spice level, I asked for medium and it was perfect!!!  My bf ordered Pineapple Fried Rice, he said \"oh yeah this is good\" and I tried it, I was surprised AGAIN, I can't explain the taste, give this menu a try and you won't regret it! I could taste the pineapple and \"curry\" but it wasn't a strong smell like Japanese curry, it was different but in a delicious way! Lol  My bf also tried their Thai Iced Coffee and the coffee was pretty strong, at least to me, but it wasn't bad, I was just thirsty and felt like drinking water.  Overall, 10/10 for the service & the food. Will definitely be coming back!!!!!",

My husband added all 3 of the chili condiments. There was a smokey flavor to the Pad Thai which was delicious. The Tom Kha was delicious as well. Thai tea was delicious and a healthy portion. We were there for lunch on Father's Day and it was very busy. The staff is very friendly. Some age shows on the booths and tables.  We will be back to try other menu options. Thank you Yelper's!!",

We literally order to-go from this place almost once a week. The best thing about Thai Rama is their portion sizes. The prices are so reasonable for the amount of food that you get. A huge plus. Another great thing is that they are always consistent with the to-go orders too. A lot of places tend to mess up your orders when ordering to-go but they got it down right. Pad Thai and the Pineapple Fried Rice are our go-to entrees but the yellow curry is really good as well. I wouldn't really recommend the appetizers but the entrees that I mentioned have been great each time. The service is always really nice as well. I would highly recommend checking this place out for some delicious Thai.",

    "text": "Glad to find this gem. Highly recommend!  Pros: Service was attentive and genuinely friendly (a big plus!!). I immedietly felt welcome the moment I got in.  Love the environment and ambiance. Whoever designed the building was smart enough to put seatings surrounding the windows. Almost all seatings benefit from the \"open\" feeling. Also I can tell a lot of thoughts were put on the decorations. They feel authentic but don't clutter the space which is something that Asian restaurants tend to do.   The crab puff were well worth the price. Reasonable portions and delicious. Again I noticed the attention to details. Each puff looks the same proportion. You may be wondering why does this matter. Well that's because you can tell when someone put a lot of effort and pride on the food they cook. It can be a relevant gauge for taste.   The other thing I got was the spicy garlic dish. I choose chicken to go with it. It was delicious.   Cons: Parking arent too bad but I can see this place can get rly busy and it may be a challenge. On the hindsight it is near the Light Rail.  Verdict will def come back. Considering a lot of options in the menu, I have good selections to try. Vey happy. :)",

When busy Thai Rama seems under staffed. We just deal with it cause we live close and love the food. But here is my main complaint and this is something all restaurants need to think about when it comes to cleaning. Use cleaning chemicals that do not smell. More than once we have been to Thai Rama after 8pm and that is when a staff person decides to clean the restrooms. The strong odor of bleach or whatever is in your products is so strong...way too strong and it ruined our dining experience. Smell is a very important element when it comes to dining.",

I would eat here everyday if I could! I've only tried a couple of items because of diet restrictions and just knowing what I like. The pineapple shrimp curry (with added veggies) is my go-to, normally with a side of egg rolls or dumplings. Their curry is so delicious that I constantly crave it, my only gripe would be what I think is a bay leaf or lemongrass (I have no idea) that throws off the taste a smidgen but not enough for me to try and order it without the mystery leaf. Their crab fried rice was good, but a little too oily/fried for my taste but it's fried rice so that's just a personal preference. It would probably make a great hangover meal. All in all I love this place!!!",

And also, they want $2 for a side of rice. That's a lot. At least they give you a good amount to begin with. There were also no shrimps in the Pad Thai, despite being listed on the menu.

I prefer when there is fresh lemongrass and thai basil in it and some spice, heat and more seasoning.   However, I had this soup there. I'm not sure which one it is. It's closer to the bottom of the soup menu. It's served in one of the metal bowl things with the flame under it. It is red and has lots of lemon grass stalks in it and what looks like it might be galangal(?)  woody looking chips, chicken (I don't even like chicken) and spicy deliciousness (that's an ingredient now). This soup is killer. I think about it all the time. If I could marry it, I might. It's only $8 as well and enough for two people to share, and I would go as far as to say that it would fill you up at lunch time.  Go there, try this soup.   Other than that.... um the place isn't very nice but it's not bad either, just a casual small little restaurant. The service is good- nothing else is very memorable about it for me except that soup, Good stuff.",

Either way, I'm not going back and that's a shame because the food is pretty good.  I order one particular chicken curry dish and I've ordered it at least 50 times over the past 3 years.  Every time it's a crap-shoot how hot they're gonna make it.  I tried the \"stars\" system.  One night, it's 5 stars; next time, 10 stars.  And the bitch of it is, neither 5 stars or 10 stars was very hot at all.  Last night I get this broad on the phone, and she says, \"how hot?\"  I say, \"hot\".  She say, \"hot-hot-hot?\", and I agree.  This, after 50 FRIGGING TRIPS TO THE TROUGH, and IT'S TWICE AS HOT AS EVER!  Passive-aggressive?  Douchebaginess?  I dunno.  I do know that Thai food is almost as common as McDonald's.  I'll just move on down the road.  Go if you like, I didn't.",

I was in a mood for vegetables or a tom yum soup or both! I normally order a side soup on tom yum but their menu only had huge bowls of it for 8-9 bucks. So I decided on the chicken red curry. My friend also had ordered a pad Thai beef, not spicy, and these chicken skewers. I felt like the chicken skewers were dry. And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me. Also, as were snacking on the appetizer, the pad Thai came out and was sitting at our table four like five minutes. Then the server came back and asked us if we touched it yet and we said no. And he took the plate without saying anything. We looked at each other in silence and thought how really weird this was. He came back and said that the pad Thai was for the other table, because they ordered chicken and we ordered beef. So a beef pad Thai came out but it was really spicy when we asked for no spice. ... So strange... Even still though, the pad Thai tasted way better than my red curry.  I also ordered a Thai hot tea, which I liked a lot. But really strange experience. I am not eager to come back.",

When he told the owner/manager about it he said that he told my husband it came that way. Wow!! That conversation NEVER took place.   Final straw, he ordered a regular iced tea. The waitress forgot to bring it so he asked the owner/manager for a tea. A few minutes later he brings the tea and five more minutes later she brings a Thai iced tea. My husband does not like cream in his tea and would NOT order it that way, but both beverages appeared on the check. Instead of complaining about a tea we'll simply take our business elsewhere.

I had to try the Thai tea after reading all the glowing reviews.... it was quite good. Maybe not super stand out from others that I've had, but good and it came in a large glass, which was nice. For food, I ordered the yellow curry and my friend had the pad see iw. I got my curry 'hot' because usually restaurants tame back the spice and it's never enough. This place did not. The curry was blazing, but delicious and full of flavor at the same time. I was happy I had the Thai tea to coat my mouth. The curry was thick, packed with potatoes, carrots, and chicken and came with a mound of rice. I ended up being able to eat it for 4 meals (big portion), and it got better each time I ate it. I definitely want to go back and try more of their food!  PS 1300!!!",

Placing the order was difficult as the women on the phone was very rude taking my order, I asked for broccoli and carrots in my meal as they should be in addition to mushrooms and a fried egg which I knew would be at extra charge . She expressed that it already had carrots and broccoli so why would I want more . I asked for chicken as my meat of choice and she began to close the call even though I wasn't done ordering . I quickly told her I wasn't done and continued to order crab puffs . Then asked for my total . She said it would be 13.15 . As I arrived to Thai Rama I walked up to the register and wasn't attended to for 4 minutes , then I was approached by a young women who asked \"pick up or dine in\" , I said \"I am picking up for Rene \" I was given my food and a total of 18.50 , wasn't too happy about that but okay . When I left I checked my meal at a red light and I noticed I didn't have any mushrooms , fried egg or chicken so I called and told the person on the phone what my issue was and I was told nothing could be done about it . At this point I was hoping I didn't have to return to work from my lunch break so I could address the issue and I was simply told \"we can't do anything about it sir\" I finalized the call by saying \"Thank you but I will not be eating there again\"",

The food portions are large, the prices are reasonable and the food tastes great. However when you walk in the door it takes some time to get the attention of someone to seat you. When I ask for extra sweet and sour it often never comes and when I can get the attention of a waiter I have to remind them and even then they take their time.   Given that I still come her regularly to eat and love their food. Parking is easy as well. It sits right on Camelback near the light rail which is also convenient. You must try their food!",

Pha Thai was also like it was made earlier that day.  We have always had really great food here and I've been going there for years, especially for their Peanut Sauce.  We spend over $50 per order each time, but so disappointed.  I can only hope if I try again, it will be better.  I have tried other Thai restaurants and there is only one on east Thomas road that I really would say is one step above.  Thai Lahna on east Indian School Road.",

We were all pretty grouchy and hungry before we spotted this Thai place, and my mom and I immediately had to to there. Being a Thursday night, it was really quiet. The place was clean, calm, and wow-- the food came quickly! Everyone loved what they had.   Pros: Fast service, incredibly friendly wait staff~, tvs (if that's your thing), lovely atmosphere, tasty food, good serving sizes for entrees (my mom and sister's also came with a big bowl of rice; mine didn't but I got more food in return), clean and quiet.  Cons: I've had spicier food. My mom ordered the spiciest available, and it was about my taste. I ordered medium and had to add chili powder myself to make it to my desired taste.  Overall, a good place to stop and eat while in the area. :)",

I went with a group of 12ish people which was great because it was my first time actually eating at a Thai restaurant so I got to try a few different dishes. I would definitely recommended the crab puffs and the egg rolls weren't bad either. Very crispy and a great sweet and sour sauce to go with them. The spicy mustard is intense. Try it. I ordered the number 66 on the menu which was a Spicy fried rice with chicken. Very good, you can choose how spicy and I went medium spicy which I felt was a very good balance of tasty and spicy. HUGE portions. I can't remember the names of everything else that I tried but everybody left satisfied. One guy in our group got the sweet and sour chicken which he absolutely loved. He was raving about it, it was almost like he was in love with it so if you like sweet and sour chicken I'd say to go for it. I'm definitely going back and I really hope it's soon because it was so good.",

There was a wide flat rice noodle dish that had a great Wake flavor form the hot wok on the noodles and egg.

Shouldn't have let R ordered since he isn't versed with Asian food, but I'm trying to be less bossy so I didn't say anything :-) The BBQ pork was sliced pork in a sweet shiny, sticky red sauce, kinda like Cantonese style, but not.  Anyway, that was a thumbs down. I don't blame the restaurant, it's just not the kind of thing you should order in a Thai restaurant anyway.  The beef curry was excellent, a little sweet, but just spicy enough. I ordered pad thai as well, but the waitress did not pick up that order and the kitchen had closed when I inquired about it. Oh well...another excuse to come back and try the other dishes.",

    "text": "This is NOT the place to go for Thai food in Phoenix. I've eaten at just about every Thai Restaurant in the area, and this is by far the worst one. The food was overpriced and bland. The coconut curry sauce was very watered down, the veggies were limp and had lost color due to there lack of freshness, there was only three pieces of tofu in my dish, and they charged me $2 extra for brown rice. Do yourself a favor and skip this place. There are only two places that I recommend for Thai food in the area; Thai Basil and Thai Elephant. You will get a much better value, better food, better atmosphere and better service at these places. Stay away from Thai Rama if you don't want to be disappointed.",

    "text": "Written by my wife, Jenny Martin:  At first glance, Thai Rama is a low-key establishment that has been able to pack the place on Friday night. Although the atmosphere is less than stylish by any standards, the yummy scent of Thai spices is inviting. My husband enjoyed a Thai beer, Sing-ha. I stepped out of my box and tried a Thai iced tea, which is a Thai blend of spiced tea with cream. Let's just say it wasn't \"my cup of tea\" but I'm sure it would be good to someone else! The menu is comprehensive, but was missing one of my favorite starters-a simple salad with Thai peanut dressing. We opted for the Thai egg rolls on the menu. They were mediocre at best, as I usually enjoy a lighter spring roll type at Thai restaurants. I almost always chose a Pad Thai on date nights at Thai restaurants, but tonight I chose to enjoy a Shrimp and Pineapple Curry dish. When the server asked how I wanted it prepared, I said \"very mild.\" I will admit I have an extreme sensitivity to anything spicy-strange that I like Thai food at all, I know. Usually, the words \"very mild\" have my dish arrive at the table to my liking. Apparently, Thai Rama likes to kick things up a notch. My mouth was on fire! Overall, I would have to say I have had better. The sauce was very watery and not very flavorful, except for the spice. The shrimp was definitely very good. The yasmin rice was outstanding-sticky but not too sticky. My husband ordered a chicken curry. He was surprised to find that it came with shredded chicken as opposed to chunks. Because he said the word \"spicy\" when ordering, his was SPICY to the max! He did enjoy his dish, although wished there was more of a soup-like consistency rather than the small amount of sauce base. As much as we love Thai food, we concluded that there are better places in the Valley for our favorite traditional dishes. The service was great, everyone was nice. Maybe we are just too picky!",

    "text": "I decided to take a friend one night out for dinner. I was recommended to come here by someone, can't remember. When I do I'll make sure to punch them in the gut. My friend who is from Mexico and handles spicy like no big deal, ordered a spicy seafood soup. Within no time at all it looked as if he was bawling into his sulfur concoction. Between the spice and the temp of the soup, it was too much. Even just the steam from the food getting into his eyes seemed to be driving him mad. He was trying to take it like a man, but once someones nose starts to let go, uh yeah, WAITRESS! I call her over and try to explain the situation. She gives me a slight, polite smile and walks away with the sopa de sulfur. Brings back the soup this time not so red, like they quickly ran it under the sink to dilute the spice. Still my friend found it too spicy, and I call her over again. She says nothing, with the same smile goes into the kitchen and now yelling is coming from where she went into. At this point my friend is pretty uncomfortable and we ask a random worker if we can just order another dish. Some lady about 3 feet tall with a biker attitude comes out and starts yelling at me for returning her dish. It's like nobody understood from the beginning that it was too spicy and hot. I got more of an idea that maybe they thought we didn't like the food. She then had the audacity to tell me that whatever I ordered next I would have to pay for as well. OH NO SHE  DI' INT!!! So, the point of the story? Unless you're up for a Tuesday Night cat fight , just order out.",
