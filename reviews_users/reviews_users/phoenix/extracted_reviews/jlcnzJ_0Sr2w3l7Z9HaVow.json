Everything was bad about this place. The food there is minimal and none of it looks good. There is even chicken nuggets and French fires... Really?  that's just how the food looks. As soon as I started eating, I can tell something wasn't right. I tried the squid, worst idea ever. Even the ice cream sucked.  As soon as we were done, we walk out, and one person from the group we went with threw up right in front of the store... Uh-oh.  We stopped for gas, went to the bathroom, and I threw everything up. Which I haven't done in about 6 years. It's sad cause the food at the gas station would probably have been better than that \"food\" at the buffet.   So after spending $12 for food I threw back up in a gas station's bathroom, I rate this place a 1 star. Wish I could give it a -5 star.",

    "text": "I've given Lin's Buffet 2 visits before I decided to write a review. By no means is the restaurant terrible, I was just a bit undecided on how much I like this place. I know for sure that they are consistent with being inconsistent.   On my first visit, I would rate the cleanliness a 7 out of 10. However, today their rating would be a 10 and this was during their morning rush.   Our server kept forgetting things such as a booster seat, refills on sodas and napkins but I'm very forgiving of these things because I too was once a server... I know the headaches a worrisome customer can bring.   The selection of food is above average and very fresh. But to me, what sets this place apart from the mass is the Mongolian Grill section. The grill master was very friendly and made my order the way I wanted. Now, please keep in mind that if you are a Stir-Fry buff like me, so far NO PLACE in the Valley beats Hong Kong Buffet in Ahwatukee on Chandler Blvd.   All in all, this place is worth another visit. Now, please excuse me... I must get back to my diet!",

Although she was nicer, all she could do is tell us we had to come back when the manager and the person who has access to the computer were in for a refund.  When asked when that would be,  she says she doesn't know!  Watch your credit/debit transactions closely with this place.",

    "text": "We walked into Lin's Grand Buffet on a Sunday around 2 and there was a line to be seated all the way to the first door (there's the outside door and then a very short corridor with a second door to the waiting area and cashier stand). Thankfully the line moved along fairly quickly and we were able to pay (you pay up front here) and be seated within 15 minutes. I did notice that there was a wait between groups being seated and that there were always open tables with seating available so perhaps during peak times they should staff one or two more hostesses to get it going more quickly.   After getting our drink orders taken, we all scurried to the buffet and explored the fairly well varied selection. I did notice that some of the plates were slightly worn out and that the whole restaurant, including the buffet floor, had worn carpet but the plates were clean and the buffet lines seemed organized so it didn't concern me too much. The sushi was plentiful, but nothing special, with the run of the mill rolls you'd expect everywhere. However, the hot food choices were excellent. The different dishes had distinct flavor as opposed to all being slightly more sweet here, slightly more spicy here heaps of goopy chicken. The beef broccoli was great, no skimping on the beef, the baby octopus was tender and spicy, the stir fried rice noodle was great, and the ribs were tender and delicious. The desert selection was fairly standard with a soft serve machine, fruit, and little cakes and cookies.   If you're looking for a large buffet to load up on tasty Asian food, this is definitely a good place to go. Sushi might let you down a bit if you're an aficionado, but I feel the rest of the buffet definitely makes up for it. For $11.79 an adult on a Sunday (and during dinner during the rest of the week), this is an excellent value.",

When you walk in you must pay for your food right away.  Then you wait to be seated.    We waited over 20 minutes.  The restaurant is busy with a high turnover and the carpets were dirty with food scraps.  The food is all sub par.  Not good at all.  For sushi I tried a roll with cream cheese and a sliver of green pepper.  Yuck!  I tried the chow mein noodles- Yuck!  Panda Express is about 100% better.  Tried the sweet sugar roll and it was stale- Yuck!  The cream cheese wanton had an old grease taste.- Yuck!  In fact the only thing edible was the broccolli and the bananas in a red sauce.  A total waste of $45 for our family to eat there.  My husband and I agreed to never go back.  That being said my 12 year old son loved it.... go figure.",

On top the a larger than usual buffet offerings, there is Mongolian BBQ available as a choice (included in price).  Although not a buffet fan, I have to say this place knows how to get people to come back.  In fact, if there's a Lin's Grand Buffet open near a Genghis Khan, I know which one will be going out of business soon.  This is certainly a MOAB (Mother Of All Buffets).  So if you're 16 years old, run 20 miles a day, and has the metabolism of a racing cheetah, enjoy.  All others, watch what and how much you eat when you come here as it is easy to overdo it.",

I had to wait in line to pay, but the wait was only about four minutes once I was seated the server came by got me my beverage and I was off to load up my plate. The selection of foods was quite vast. Everything was fresh and as I was loading up I saw several attendees bringing out more fresh food. Lin's also had a Mongolian Grill, the only downside to that was the options were limited and you don't get the choice of what sauces to add to your food. After eating my fill, I left around 12:30 PM. When walking out the line was three times as long as it was when I arrived. So my advice, get there early or during off peak hours.",

The first trip I made was to the grill and sushi. The grill was out of noodles, but the veggies and meat I chose were done very nicely and the guy working was extremely nice. In fact everybody who worked there was really nice. The sushi was pretty good as well, with nice large rolls including a couple with raw fish. They were kept the correct temperature and was being monitored and replenished by the sushi chef. All the food that I had from the buffet was pretty good...nothing struck me as off or bad.... Of course it wouldn't be a Chinese buffet in the Valley if they didn't have some sort of tacos/ tamales/ enchiladas here... which they had enchiladas that were okay.   Some of the best dishes in my opinion were the cheese wonton which was not too crunchy like most places.... the baby octopus was very tender and not overly chewy like most buffets, the baked salmon was amazing, and for desert I enjoyed hte powdered donut holes as well as a slice of chocolate chip chocolate cake with some vanilla soft serve. Most likely I will be back to this place.",

They don't smile, act very unhappy to see you walk in the door, and when we waited 15 minutes for our drinks and had to go ask them about them, they wanted to blame another guy on the floor in front of me instead of just fixing the problem. You can be as polite as you want to these girls and they show no good character to you, not even a \"your welcome\" . I like the place, but the customer service just from the two hostesses I had to meet for the second time coming here makes me want to find another place to eat. The other staff running around were all really great at getting us refilled and taken care of and the  food is pretty good with a lot of selection,but those two hostesses.....smh.",

The wait staff is okay... it's a buffet, so it's easy for drinks to run dry.   Also, they're fortune cookies are actually GOOD.

The place is big and the decoration is on point, waiters are nice and check on you often. There could be more selection as far as the food choices, they have a hibachi grill and they cook your steak anyway you want it, they also have a sushi bar. I have seen smaller placer with far better food choices. The reason this place is getting four stars is because the area where you get to get your food is too small and gets crowded to easily, you have to wait for people to finish getting their food to be able to get yours, that makes it awful awkward. Other than that price is reasonable and the environment is very family friendly.",

I constantly ask Why?!  Why pay that kinda money when you can go to a restaurant where you'll be seated and given a menu, place an order, served, checked on, and then dishes cleared from your table instead of dishes gathering -and all for the same price. Yes, I realize you get so much more variety, but the quality??? In case you haven't picked up on this yet I am not a fan of Chinese buffet -anywhere.   Quality is always sub par and price just seems to cover the excessive waste and not actual product.   Oysters are dry, over cooked, and some are so bad I had to remove from my mouth. Shrimp is over done.  Baby octopus were whole.  That was interesting. My husband and son said the bread is really good. Lmao.  You gonna make bread your meal at a buffet? More often than not my husband and I could split an entree and still have leftovers, if we could ever agree on eating the same thing.  So variety IS good, but for me this place just doesn't seem to do a single thing on their buffet really well.   Unless it's the bread my son and husband seem to like.",

Not everyone who walks in is there for you and to admire your beauty because the world revolves around you. Some people,like me, just want to enjoy a nice dinner ight.  I walked in Cashier:just one?  Me:high good evening, how are you doing today?  Why do I have more manners then the employees?   I paid my fee to get in and was asked to stand on the side and wait to be seated by a bus girl, so I stand and wait and I see some bus girl approaching me, I say \"hi how is it going?\" And the girl  grabes a fork but no knife and just nods her head to follow her ...tf?  I guarantee you that if I was in need of a job and I applied here I will end up taking both of those females job. There are just up in the front for being pretty,I rather have an ugly girl or a guy attend me who will do an awesome job vs a stuck up young pretty female who will do a horrible job.  The only reason I am giving this place a 2 star instead of 1 is because the other bus girl who kept picking up my plates and refilling my drink was actually very kind. I wish I would've gotten her name but she was covering the center front tables on Friday night around 8pm sept 9. She looks Hispanic and had highlights or light brown hair I believe.  I asked her if she shares tips with everyone or is he keeps them and she said she keeps them. I said good. I don't want anyone else getting my money as a gratitude for their hard work.",

They even have a Mongolian Chef,as well as a Sushi Chef. All very good. I wish they brought a tea pot with hot tea. But instead they bring you a foam cup with a straw and lid. But, my friend got Ice Tea and she got a glass with a straw. I thought that procedure was a little odd.  Lots of parking outside, and the service was good. He kept coming to check on us.

    "text": "I am only giving this place 1 star because I cant give it zero.  This place is absolutely disgusting.  We drove by this place a lot in the past week because we were frequenting South Mountain Preserve and with all the blazing lights outside, we thought this place was literally beckoning us to try them out.  I'm already not a huge fan of buffets for hygienic reasons and because most buffets are built for high capacity food to be dished out quickly. As a result the foods in buffets are rarely ever made fresh. But there are a few I'm actually impressed with, so I cant completely disregard buffets as a whole.  The outside of this place looks like a Chinese ski lodge with a neon light trim. There is nothing around it except for a Circle K across the street, so this place really stands out.  Kids under 2 eat free. I kinda wish we were all under 2 years old tonight for this meal.  The cashier was friendly, the host was weird about seating us and our server was probably the best part about that place. So II'll take back my first sentence, Id like to give that one star to her.  The place was very busy which I thought was a sure sign that it was going to be a great buffet, but I took a good look around. A reaaallllly good look.  If you took every single person that was on parole in AZ and seated them at a Chinese buffet, that's what you would get. 'Twas a bit creepy in there.  Aside from that, let me get down to the food....  I took a little bit of everything.  It's what I always do.  The food looked weird to me, like it was purchased from the supermarket, thawed out and placed under the heat lamp for everyone.  The ONLY items that looked normal were the jello (which is already a bizarre food anyway), the rice and the ice cream.  That's it. The sushi was an absolute joke, fried fish was bready and greasy, jalapeno chicken/sweet n sour chicken all tasted like a packet of syrup was mixed and then drizzled on top.  My son (who actually has an excellent palate) said the pizza tasted like yogurt. Like YOGURT!   Quite possibly the most unsightly thing I saw tonight was a seafood blend (casserole) that looked like somebody vomited on the tray.  I saw two scrapes taken from that tray. I'll say a prayer for the 1-2 individuals who ate that tonight because that was absolutely disgusting.  There is so much food there and I'd love to go through the list, but to be honest there's no point.  Just dont go there.  Save your money and go elsewhere. Anywhere but there.",

With the combination of blasting A/C and screaming children, I didn't want to stay there long. I tried as much as I could aside from what was against the back wall because my lunch break was close to being over.   The thing that bothered me the most was that they didn't bother to de-shell (if thats what it's called) the shrimp, it still had a full shell and all of it's little legs attached :/  So I doubt I'll be coming back here again, though I won't fail to mention if you do like coming here that they have a neat To-Go offer where you can fill a styrofoam box with a pound of food for 4.97. So I guess that's nice.",

The pretty girls at the front are very polite but often won't look you in the eye. The servers are similarly polite but often will be running past your table while they drop off your drink. After all, this is a buffet place and you can't expect service much better than that.  The food is extremely inconsistent but even on its best days is just okay and never really all that good. I tried the Mongolian Grill and found it to be very good comparatively and thought I had found a reason to actually come here. However, just today I went to put together a plate and found the pork all mixed up with the chicken. The beef is a very strange unnaturally beet red while the pork is pink. There was no doubt that there was pork mixed with the chicken. Unfortunately, for Jews and Muslims or others who refrain from pork, this is a show-stopper.  So with the Mongolian Grill (which I acutally liked) now forever off limits, I was forced to try their other offerings. Out of everything, the only things I could stomach were Teriyaki chicken sticks, the chicken and broccoli and the beef and broccoli. The other standard \"Chinese restaurant\" fare like Kung Pao beef tasted like detergent on one day. The next day I tried it, it was a little more palatable but still not very good.  After seeing the pork so carelessly mixed up with the chicken at the Mongolian Grill counter and with the overwhelming majority of the buffet items unpalatable, I will probably not come here again.",

It's an impressive buffet establishment - spanking new, very spacious, lots of seating, more than ample parking. There is a large array of dishes from the main self-serve area, plus a Mongolian grill & steak area as well as a sushi counter - though the array of sushi is a bit limited here. The dishes are typical of super buffets and are very well-prepared. There is a large staff very efficiently attending to the large crowd. The South Mountain community finally has a good buffet in the area - good for them! And good for me, as I'm frequently in area too!",

When it first opened they did a great job of maintaining the serving lines in terms of cleanliness.  Nowadays, it's hit or miss.  Today's visit wasn't too bad, but the ice cream machine was just plain nasty!  So much so that I didn't allow my kiddos to have any. They also haven't done much to maintain the place in general. Many of the chairs are in need of being replaced or reupholstered and the carpet is severely worn and in need of replacement.  There is always a decent crowd here so I'd love to see them reinvest some of their profits into keeping the place nice.  Most of the food is decent - my hubby and son love the ribs and we all love the sopapillas - but it is buffet, which means if there aren't a lot of diners the food will not be fresh.  That was the case with the chicken nuggets, french fries, and salad tonight unfortunately.",

They have a lot of dishes that you'd find at a Panda Express, but they are really oily and the taste isn't that great.  You can also find some other selections like soups, salad, fried creatures, chicken wings, a sushi bar, a Mongolian BBQ-style area, and some fruit and puddings.  I was a bit disappointed with the sushi selection as most rolls had minimal Ahi and avocado.  Compared to other buffets in the area with a similar price range, they are also missing snow crab legs and some more dishes with shrimp.  I also found the hostesses to be overly mechanical rather than genuinely hospitable.  The price for adults is $10.59/ person on the evenings AND weekends (i.e. even during lunch), and $8.29 during the week.  I posted a picture of the prices for reference as there wasn't one.  The quality isn't that great, but it does the job.  In all, again, Lin's was an okay experience, but not as \"grand\" as the restaurant name implies.",

Waited 10 minutes to speak to one and when she approached me she said \"what's the Problem\". I expressed to her I was unhappy and wanted a refund and she asked if we ate and I told her maybe 3 bites. She said she cannot give me a refund. I said why not, she said because you ate the food. I said where are your signs that say no refunds? She was completely clueless and offered me nothing, not even to warm up the food or remake Anything. Not a voucher coupon. Strongly discourage anyone from going to this place. Absolutely disgusting and very dissatisfied. Do not go here!!!!!!!",

    "text": "I know I said I wasn't a fan of your standard Chinese buffet, but this one isn't what I'd call standard.  I'd call it pretty freaking good.  If you go on the weekend, be prepared for a wait.  The crowd is pretty typical for a buffet, complete with your big families with their packs of feral children.  But during the week its less chaos--not always a better crowd but fewer of them. I was impressed with the quality of the food.  They had several dishes that I went back for seconds on, not just stuff that looked like it had less chance of making me sick than the other stuff.  The fried fish, of all things, was a stand out hit.  The kung pao and General Tso chicken were good too.  Usually anything breaded is to be avoided, it usually has tree rings from being re-battered and refried for recycling on the buffet.  I didn't find any of that here.  The veggie dishes were fresh and crispy, not cooked to death.  In fact, anything that I thought looked like it'd been sitting too long was replaced with fresh by the time I went up again.  Now, the Mongolian style fix your own was lacking in that they used their pre made sauces instead of what you mix yourself.  And the sushi didn't look like anything I was willing to risk.  Other than those minor issues, it was very good.  I would go back and eat there again, just not on a weekend!",

Here's the rundown: -variety=8 -ambiance=5 -cleanliness=5 -quality of food=2  The food was leftover from lunchtime so it was very dry except for the perpetually wet stuff. The sushi was horrible and dry until they made fresh Cali rolls but they were below average at best. Enchiladas looked dry, ribs look like \"ehh\". Just a lot of sub-par quality food. Oh yeah, raw shrimp were medium shrimp with poop vein and shells still on.  This place will fill you but its not a eat here again type of place. Dinner was $12.99 with drinks costing extra.  ps, their website photos are fake, thats what sold me on going there.",

Great selection of all your favorite Chinese (not really Chinese food) Food is freshly made. Staff is polite. And the booths are clean and comfortable.   There is a line of course, because the food is really that good! Someone suggested it and I was like not really. Cuz phoenix Chinese food sucks. But as I dived into the food my eyebrows went up and the food went down.  Plan on visiting soon.   Worth the price",

The staff at Lin's are very friendly, and our server brought our drinks to the table right away.   The food at Lin's, is fair.  Lin's  offers a large selection of entree's  including cooked to order mongolian grill, as well as seafood, baked salmon, octopus, various beef & chicken dishes, and  BBQ ribs. Lin's also has a salad bar with several salads, jello, pudding & fruits.  Lin's does  not have a drink station where you can get your own water, soda, tea or coffee. However, servers are quick to  refill your beverage.  The service at Lin's is good. The wait staff were quick to take away dirty plates and refill beverages.  Lin's is not one of my favorite Buffet spots, but you could do worse in a pinch.",

We live in Prescott Valley and our Chinese food restaurants/buffets are very limited. We arrived at 11:00am their opening time and there was a line inside and out. I thought wow, this must be a great place. The quantity of food was there. Our server was excellent. I remembered why I don't frequent these places often because of the overeaters. I will say the so called sushi was terrible. I ordered a hot tea and it normally comes with a little kettle and hot water. Not this one. Just Luke warm water. I didn't get a lot of flavor from the food. A little bland even on the kung pow.   Needless to say, it will be another year before I try another buffet.",

I attended on a Saturday night, the crowd it attracted was surprisingly one that doesn't know how to act in public.  Food scraps all around the floor.  Three children raising havoc in the restroom, I watched three female young adults sitting together have a altercation and one had to beat on another.  This is the crowd this location attracts!  The restaurant staff did nothing to intervene in any situation which they list as inappropriate behavior.  This location is going to need bouncers to supervise the dining room as well as the parking lot.  Not a civil dining experience, it doesn't matter what the food quality is.",

After I'm done with my business I notice neither of the soap dispensers have soap in them. They were so bone dry it looked like they hadn't been filled in weeks. I told one of the servers after I got out of the bathroom and used some hand sanitizer I carry with me. While I filled my plate the only thing I could think of was the chefs who cooked the food who hadn't used soap to was their hands and all those before me that had grabbed the serving tongs. After I sat down with my daughter to eat I glanced over towards the servers area just in time to see one of the servers in plain view shoving his finger in his mouth to pick something out of his back teeth and then grab someone's drinks to bring them to a table. Needless to say I was disgusted. The only reason this place gets 1 star is because the little food I did manage to stomach was okay, but I won't be going back.",

Going in knowing you are going to a buffet and not a five star Chinese restaurant helps.  With that this is by far the best buffet (outside the real high end Las Vegas ones) I have ever been to.  The food is hot, tasty, plenty of choices and FRESH.  The price is also very reasonable (I think $13ish) for dinner. Lins has changed my opinion on the nasty Chinese Buffets that surround this town!  I will be back.",

    "text": "So we have been wanting to try this place since before it opened and finally tried it tonight.  Never again!  It is decently priced for buffets but doesn't come with a drink...and then you get the food and start to think that it is now overpriced.  The green beans were hard, the spring rolls were bland, as were the pork eggrolls and most of the food.  My daughter LOVES rice and noodles and after one bite wouldn't touch the white rice or lo mein noodles again.  The \"salmon\" nigiri was like plastic and the rice in the sushi wasn't good either...later found out that it is the same rice for the buffet and sushi.  Broccoli in the veggie delight and the beef n broccoli was pretty good but the beef was really fatty and chewy and the mongolian beef lacked.  They have both hot and cold mussels, the cold ones drip a lot of water and come frozen and just get put out and the hot ones come frozen and get heated a bit, both are chewy.  Popcorn shrimp has very dry breading, chicken nuggets and fries couldn't have been to good since again my daughter only had one bite of those.  Out of the soups the only decent one was the egg drop soup.  Even the mushrooms were kinda meh,  it's like they took a random brown sauce and threw some button mushrooms  in it without doing anything else.  It's like everything comes in frozen but they don't even get their food from a good supplier.  The baked sweet potatoes were really but they don't have brown sugar to put on them.  And Tim was our server person/glorified busser, and he did a great job and was friendly...plus, we spoke with a manager and he was really nice but didn't seem like he has a firm grasp on everything and more make excuses like sundays being crazy days for them and that was why the floor was so dirty and covered with food and trash, and he did say that they are building more and already have some in other cities and states and that they all use the same recipes, so BEWARE.  Lastly my guy will eat just about anything and even some of the most disgusting things and doesn't have issues with it and before we left he was already running to the bathroom",

We were quickly seated at noon on a Saturday. I was with a party of 12, they only allow you to put two tables together so if your party is more than 8 you will be split up. The food stations were clean as well, everything looked picture perfect. There was a Mongolian Stir Fry Station, Sushi Station, & \"Bakery\" (notice he italics). I sampled several chicken items and some shrimp entrees. The chicken entrees were good but they all tasted the same so whether you get General Tso's, Broccolli and Chicken, or Cashew Chicken it's all basically the same flavor- SOY. I liked the soft served ice cream, it beats having little kids try to scoop out their own ice cream like a lot of other Chinese style buffets do. I was brave and tried the Baby Octopus, the sauce was great but it was so chewy that my jaw literally started to hurt from munching so much. Didn't get to try the American food items but I definitely will have to go back and try before I write this place off. The biggest plus was the cute waiter that constantly kept our  cups full.",

The landscaping is dead or dying and the landscape granite is all over the paths. Worst of all were the state of the booths in the dining area. They have be slashed and ripped to shreds. There wasn't a booth in eyesight that didn't have big holes or gashes in the seat. The booths are surrounded by a decorative white rail - do not look closely at this rail while eating. As well has having a nice layer of dust, the rail is covered in food stains and sticky fingerprints. It might also be wise to keep looking forward so you don't see the state of the carpet. The food was still ok, the waitress who takes the drinks order and removes plates was ok, unlike the attractive but cold and angry cashier who clearly hates her job. We won't be back..it reaks of bad management and is only going to get worse unless big changes are made.",

I have to give them credit though for also offering steaks even though I rarely get them.

I did not like how the tables were all meshed together, I understand being popular but the customers should be comfortable.

Then there were all the typical chinese dishes you find at most restaurants along with a mongolian grill, and finally the dessert selection. I picked this place because I figured my 7 year old would find some of the things he likes, and I was right! Two of my favorite items I tried were the fried green beans ( still super crispy) and the mushrooms.",

They have sushi,stir fry as well...the only real issue I have is the temperature in the restaurant is always very warm so it ends up being uncomfortable to stay for very long...also alot of their food items that are supposed to be hot are mostly Luke warm to cold at times. The cold bar seems to be quite messy most of the time with some of the salads having a really bland or lack of flavor. The price is rather high so if your on a budget probably not a good choice. Overall it is a decent place to eat every once in a while.",

But here at Lins, not only is the interior beautiful, but the food is really tasty. The only thing I didn't like, however, was the sushi. The sushi station itself smelled weird (at least when I went) and the sushi was bland. Overall though, I will definitely be back and recommending this place to others!",

He chicken skewers and sushi were nothing to write home about either. I was disappointed since these are two Of my favorites. Surprisingly--and I know this is probably not what you came for, but maybe you should--the ribs and buffalo wings were delicious!  Overall three stars. I'd give 3.5 just for how clean and neat the place is. For me, personally, my favorites missing likely means I'll try somewhere else next time I'm in town.",

Terrible service. Oh and out table that we were waiting for in the segregated section was filthy with a dirty bucket and trash! Oh why did we stay!   Okay on for food. Everything is fried! The only salad was old & wilted. Food is very salty and greasy! Fruit was acceptable.   All I can say! You get what you pay for. We came to remember a family member who passed and won't be back.

The Baseline and 34th street location has such a wide variety of Chinese and American cuisine along with salads, fruits desserts a Mongolion BBQ and a bakery. The staff are attentive of course keep in mind it does get packed. The only reason I gave it a 4.0 is because my companion had the oysters, but not up to standard. If you don't like oyster everything else is on top especially when you consider dinner is $12.95 a person.",

When i walked up to the sushi station, the person who was supposed to be running the sushi station was crouched and was very will hidden while eating food ( he looked like smeagel) super sanitary right.

Once we were all there they took us to 2 separate tables for 6. That defeats a purpose of a family dinner doesn't it? I said \"We don't want to sit separate.\" She seemed very bothered & said she would try to find a table for 12.

    "text": "Lin's is a great place to go once or twice a year when you are just craving 1000 pounds of questionable americanized Chinese food.  This place is like your classic mall Chinese food, but done pretty well. I've been twice and there's always lots of food, it's usually hot and reasonably fresh, and the service is above average considering how busy it is.  The prices are reasonable--dinner is $10.69.   Also, I am embarrassed to say it, but the buffalo wings are way good.  Why the three stars? Two reasons...  First, the customer base here is really... interesting. It's kind of like eating while sitting on the floor of an inner city Walmart. There are children running around everywhere, most of whom are poorly dressed. When I went a couple nights ago, I saw a fat 9 yr old boy with a \"YOU SUCK\" t-shirt on, and another kid about 5 yrs old with skull and crossbones logos all over his baggy sweatshirt. To be fair, most of the older clientele are just regular fat guys grubbing out at the ol' buffet, but a fair number of the customers here just exude a lack of class. Lin's has a huge pump bottle of A1 near the \"steak\" area. I mean really... if it's under the guise of Chinese buffet, they sure aren't trying very hard.  Second, for some reason there is this intense sense of discomfort associated with being at Lin's that I can't really explain, like you just want to scarf down all your food as fast as you can and get the hell out of there. I think it's mostly caused by the crowdedness everywhere. The chairs are pretty close to each other, the people at the buffet seem ravenous and you always have to be careful to not bump into Big Momma behind you who is snatching up all the crawfish, corn on the cob and french fries she can. Nobody goes here for the atmosphere, and usually I don't care at all about things like this, but here it's extreme and you feel very rushed.  I'll go back the next time I have no regard for my health or happiness and just need to gorge myself on cheap food, because the food really isn't too bad, but I would not make Lin's a regular on my list.",

We told the hostess that we were a party of 11 and they looked confused on where to put us, they sat us in the back at 2 different tables so the party got broken up, but that didn't really bother us too much. The buffet was 8 per person not including drink, I ordered a drink and it averaged about 11 for the meal. Another thing I was searching for was the enchiladas, few had mentioned that there was some and low and below I found them! Cheese enchiladas, I didn't try them but some coworkers did and they said they tasted good. The buffet offered a lot of choices for food, any picky eater would be able to find something, but the food itself was ok it wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular, and left me wanting more in flavor.

The building is big, Lot's of seating, but many of the booths NEED new seats. Ripped/ torn very worn. Other than that the place looked clean. There was a big variety of food choices, including sushi. And the food tasted pretty good. The problem I had was that the food was cold. The serving temperature was too low. I don't think the heating pans were working very well. I was grossed out by the shrimp battered & fried-with the head and legs still on, that means the shrimp was NOT deveined, the same for the crawfish YUCK",

Ended up filling up on noodles which, again, lower quality than Panda Express. Everything I tried was wildly under-seasoned and I just felt kind of sick after. I can normally put away an embarrassing number of cream puffs, but I only got one bite into one here before being overcome with disappointment. I love a good buffet, this just isn't a good buffet.",

    "text": "I am a huge fan of asian buffets and it was only time before I visited Lin's Grand Buffet.  I am going to start this review with the food is sub-par at best, but I STILL gave it 4 stars and here is why.  When you drive up to Lin's you notice that there is ample parking everywhere. I drive by this place every day and I cannot remember a time the parking lot was not filled with cars. That is usually an indicator. You walk into the facility and you notice how clean and majestic the entire place looks. The asian themed glasswork, the huge stone horses above the buffet along with modern/rustic aged wood tables really brings the place alive.  I paid for my meal was seated immediately. Beverages came quick and I was off to ravage the buffet. The buffet is an assortment of every nationality and ethnicity. You could get traditional Chinese food with Mexican enchiladas and Southern fried fish. Ordinarily this would be off-putting, but no where in the name did it say it was a Chinese buffet. The Mongolian grill attendant was prompt and cooked my selection quick. The sushi section had an actual sushi chef working in there and the buffet itself was clean and well stocked.  The food is what you would expect from a Buffet. No one goes to a buffet for how \"great\" the food it, but rather the selection and undoubtedly, the quantity. I polished off 4 plates myself. Some highlights of good tasting food included the soups, Jalapeno Chicken and the deserts. The rest of the food was mediocre and it was hard to discern from the 20 chicken dishes that looked identical. the shrimp was pretty stale and the fresh fruit all had freezer burn after tastes. I am still puzzled why there is a selection of 6 or 7 salad dressings, when all the salads in the trough already come with dressing on them.  Despite all of this, our entire meal for 2 including drinks and tax came to $32. That is a win. Most buffets for dinner range in the $15.99 - $18.99 per person.  This place was $12 per person. Again, I am hard pressed to find any food connoisseur that goes to buffet for their extraordinary food. You go there for selection. This place was clean, great service, and a steal at $12 per person. I definitely recommend coming here as a budgeted dinner option. Again, it is a buffet for $12.",

I want to lose about 20 pounds and when you put \"free\" food in front of me I will eat it (yes, I know that technically I paid for it but once paid there's an unlimited supply). It's a wonder I'm not as big as a house.  Having said that, my friend and I went there for lunch and were both shocked, first at the number of choices and at how good everything tasted. I was stoked to see the Mongolian buffet. Eating at a Mongolian restaurant typically costs at least as much as we paid to eat here, but I still have so many more different kinds of food to eat.   I'm too lazy to name everything that I had and rate it, but I will say that I was surprised at how good the items like Buffalo wings and enchiladas were (at a Chinese food restaurant?). They of course had many of the Chinese buffet staples and they also tasted great.   I really don't understand the low rating. We paid $7.99 for lunch and I don't know what more people are asking for. To have an unlimited amount of food to eat with this many food choices that are each really good on their own? I give it 5 stars because I can't imagine getting more for my lunch dollar than this.   In fact, just writing about it has inspired us to go right now.   PS: Please close this place immediately so that I don't go there too often. I have tightly bolstered car seats and I hate it when I can feel my \"love handles\" rubbing.",

    "text": "This place is a definite hit or miss Chinese buffet. We've gone here about 5 times, three of those visits were worthy of 1 star, the other two visits deserved 4 stars.  The last visit was horribly pathetic on so many levels, not all Lin's fault but hey, it is what it is. It was grocery shopping day, so usually we grab something quick after we unload and put away the groceries. Lin's is right around the corner, so we debate a bit on where to go and ultimately end up here. We say to each other \"I hope this is a HIT night, not a miss\". It was a miss, but still edible and the kids love picking out their own entrees. Here's where the demotion of stars happens, again not directly Lin's doing.  A family comes in after us, maybe 6 of them. They are seated directly behind our table. After the loud belching and choice words the man and woman start to argue, spewing out F bombs here and there, threatening each other with physical harm. He dares her to get up and try to slap his face, she dares him right back...she double dares him..ooooooooh! Well I started to get a little uncomfortable with the conversation, mainly because my 4 year old and 6 year old are sponges....and my 12 year old just stares and giggles. They also had a 6 year old, I know this because that's the topic of their argument. She says \"you just a baby daddy, shut your f'ing mouth, you never do bleep when it comes to him so mind your own business...blah blah blah. Suddenly she decides to chuck a heavy glass salt shaker at him with the force of an MLB pitcher, but obviously this 200+ lb woman isn't on any league, and misses. Unfortunately her aim was right at my head...it swooshed by so fast on the top of my head, whew, luckily it didn't hit me head on. Here's where I'm confused, the waitress saw this event and asked me if I was alright, I was. Not once were these animals asked to leave, or confronted by the staff. My husband had to say something to the lady but other than that it was a free for all. I'm sure we'll eat there again...just be cautious of who sits near you...and please Lin's, replace those salt shakers with the cheap plastic or cardboard ones :)",

    "text": "I am giving Lin's 4 stars as a 4 star buffet, not a 4 star restaurant because I think there is a big difference.  It's not cheap but a decent value. We paid $52 for 4 adults for Sunday dinner, including 3 fountain drinks. Although it was busy when we got there around 5:30, there was no wait. When we left at 6:15 the lobby was full of people waiting to be seated. The place is very pretty and feels a bit like a Vegas buffet. We were seated upstairs, which was nice as we were further from the noise and chaos from the lower level where the food is.  The selection of foods is huge. I had a small piece of steak cooked to order and it was very thin but tender and had good flavor. The boys had several different pieces of sushi and said they were \"alright.\" My favorite surprise was the fried sweet bananas.  I am sure we will be back and make this a regular go-to place when we can't agree on what we want.",

I am a huge Spareribs fan, and if you catch them bringing a fresh set out, the ribs there will compete with any I have had anywhere else.  Last but not least, is choice.  They have 3 rows of buffet and a cook to order section (It was okay but not the highlight).  My son is not a big foodie, so it is usually hard for us to go out anywhere but an Applebee's or equivilant and that gets boring.  This is not a straight chinese buffet.  They had nuggets, wings, onion rings and fries just to name a few options.  This means everyone in my family had something to eat and we all left happy.  And leaving happy is the most important thing when going out.",

The prices are cheaper than most buffets but the restaurant itself and food is better than most.  The selection is what you will find in most buffets but they also have steak, sushi and Mongolian grill.  The only complaint we had is that the food wasn't warm enough.  Wait staff/bussers were pretty diligent.  This location just opened recently so it is always busy so be prepared to wait for a seat.  I am not a big fan of Chinese buffets but I will definitely eat there again.",

    "text": "A disappointment.   Through the end of 2010 I drove by this location while it was being built. It opened late December with a splash by having lights, balloons, and flags. There was no not noticing it had opened.  I figured it can not just be the novelty of the newness of it since the parking lot has been full every day since, there must be something good inside.   The Chinese New Year came and figured what better way to celebrate than to go out for Chinese. So off we drove and decided to skip going to the Chinese Cultural Center that has some great restaurants and stopped by Lin's Grand Buffet.  The entrance greets you with a great chandelier and teenagers at the register.You pre-pay for your meal and, although the place is huge, you may still wait for a table even if there are clean tables. Once you are seated a waiter. waitress in my case, will come by and ask for the type of drink to bring. (Note - They do not have alcohol not even Asian beers.)   There are some great decor items in the seating/tables area, just take a look at some of the snapshots for this place. However, great decor can only go so far towards a good dining experience. One must remember this is a buffet after all and that it is inexpensive. Also the place may be pretty but the floor in the dining area are not kept clean.  Now to the food, which is the main make it or break it part of any restaurant. There are vast arrays of options in hot plates, a sushi area, and a Mongolian  Grill. The hot plates have almost every possible option that you will get from an American-Chinese menu in addition to items that I am assuming are there to fit with the area this restaurant is in; items like enchiladas, French fries, etc. The flavors of those items were ok but not much better than that Panda chain of restaurants. Come to think about it Panda has some better tasting ones. In essence the dishes here are uninspired and nothing new and are what you would expect from a Chinese buffet in Phoenix. The sushi is an item to skip as most people seem to not care for it so those of us who would, end up having dry pieces as they sat waiting to be chosen. Did not try the Mongolian grill area. One additional thing to point out, our drinks were not promptly refreshed.  Bottom line if the reason you go to a restaurant is for pretty decor then this is your place. If the taste of the food itself is more important then forget about this place.",

Unfortunately, none of it was really that noteworthy.  There's a huge selection, including sushi and a Mongolian grill, along with a dessert row. I focused on the basics - fried rice and lo mein, and various meats such as sweet and sour chicken, sesame chicken, kung pao chicken, general's chicken, teriyaki chicken, buffalo wings, pepper steak, and barbecue spareribs. None of it was bad, but there was really nothing special about any of it.  It's a nice place, and it might be worth checking out a second time to try the Mongolian grill to see how it compares to places like YC's, but I'm not really in a hurry to go back. There are plenty of smaller Chinese buffets out there.",

I could tell they were still in their 'grand opening' phase, because the place was completely packed.  When we stepped in, there were about 10 people in line ahead of us, but fortunately, the line moved very quick and we were seated immediately after we paid (~$11/person).  I also saw people order a buffet take-out.  You get a styrofoam container and fill the contents with whatever is out on the buffet floor.  I think they charge you by the pound.  The selection was vast, with the majority of dishes being Chinese-ish.  They have a sushi bar, but the selection looked very limited.  They also have mongolian bbq, which I saw many people line up for.  One guy had a plate stacked up so laughably high that I was amazed it hadn't fallen over a few times.  I spent most of my time at the made-to-order steak station.  The steaks aren't very thick at all, but they're good enough for what you're paying for.  The service was great.  Our waitress kept our waters full, and had no problems with us lingering around afterwards to chit chat.  When we got up to leave, she and the hostesses at the front gave their thanks for coming in.  Lin's Grand Buffet is a decent place for lunch/dinner if you're hungry and in the mood for a Chinese buffet complete with mongolian bbq, sushi and steaks.",

(i think lin's usually opens at 11:00, so if you come then, you can avoid the parking hassle).  i usually just skip the rice and load my plates with fresh salad and the meat dishes. everything's is yummy, and the taste of each dish, while not top notch, is distinct from each other.  my favorite is the sweet bbq pork ribs. and i usually leave some room for their fresh baked cookies and ice cream.  the staff is also very friendly and respectful.  thanks lin's! don't change!",

Anyway, when we first walked in, it seemed to be extremely large on the outside and in the lobby area. After my boyfriend paid for our meals & drinks, we were escorted to our seats. The interior is beautiful - as well as the tables we ate on! I absolutely loved the decoration pieces - but, honestly, that's as far as I'll go with praises.  While I do understand that one shouldn't have high expectations at a buffet, we were still met with disappointment.  The food wasn't very good and it actually made me sick (nausea) while my boyfriend felt it as well. I'm only writing this review now because I was trying to take care of my stomach. The food was very bland period and while the restaurant itself seemed grand and wonderful - the selections weren't very diverse. It only had the minimal types of food one would expect at a $5.99 buffet.  Another thing I didn't like were how the selections were laid out as well. Why was the sushi bar hidden? The Mongolian Grill would have been a nice addition if it didn't have pizza, cakes, and cookies next to it. Shouldn't the cakes & cookies be in the dessert section anyway? Speaking of the dessert, they were also laid out by the seafood - which, I personally felt, was something that majorly concerned me as a whole.  This buffet was not worth the price my boyfriend and I paid for (even if we did get free refills) and for sure, we will not be going back again.",

    "text": "Really good value. Two visits with the four of us--no one ever got sick.  Let's face it--we are talking about a Chinese buffet here, so don't expect a \"foodie\" review like we usually give, since all of these Chinese buffets offer the same quick fare. For that reason alone our ratings scale is based upon what college professors would consider to be a \"sliding scale\". Therefore let us continue...  We are awarding 4 stars to Lin's Grand Buffet for some specific surprises:  1.) The fried fish and fried shrimp were very good. Like, SURPRISINGLY good, especially since we are grilled fish/healthy eaters (but the grilled salmon that day was \"fishy\", thus the discovery of the fried stuff). Our suggestion is to try a very tiny piece of fish before proceeding further, since cooking varies from day to day.  2.) The cheese enchiladas are perfect. (Weird, right?) But we were craving them that day.  3.) Yummy \"critters\". Our other surprise was that our 19-year-old stuffed his face with little octopus and LOVED them. He had never had them before, either, and the whole thing started as a dare... He also piled his plate several times with the crayfish. All of it gross to us, but obviously not to him. The octopus are tiny and look like little cartoons. The crayfish are just like I remember them from playing in the creeks of Texas as a child.  There is a HUGE assortment of foods here--something for everybody. Ribs are good, but not too much meat on them, chicken wings are good, pot stickers are good. They've got everything you can imagine and more. Salad bar is a disappointment. Not too many healthy vegetable toppings. Very basic stuff there, including the ever present chocolate pudding.  The husband got two plates of Mongolian Barbecue, so to whoever mentioned previously they don't have this anymore, apparently they do still have this feature of the restaurant. Hubby liked it. Said the first cook \"made it great\" and the second cook (when he went back for seconds) \"made it meh\". Depends on your cook, we guess.  The sushi is uninteresting and dry. Full disclosure, we didn't ask for anything specific to be made for us, so we don't know if that is an option here. Can anyone enlighten us? (Thanks.)  The deserts are dry and monotonous--you know the drill on this stuff.  We refuse to call the soft-serve (which comes in chocolate, vanilla, or swirl) \"ice cream\". It is food-grade \"D\" frozen \"treat\". Nasty stuff, eat at your own risk kind of territory. But again, our son, despite himself and God love him, kept going back for more. Blecht!..and LOL! In our humble opinion, this was the worst part of our  visits.  We've always had great/attentive servers. We say the only drawback is the ripped seating. When we asked for another booth on a busy night the hostess laughed and told us that all of the seats are ripped. So, come on, Phoenix! Let's sit properly, mm'kay? This can be prevented. Otherwise the place is huge and kind of cool/pretty looking. It seems clean enough. Bathrooms are new/clean.",

Then you go to another line at the host station and wait to be seated.   I'm not a big fan of buffets in general, but if you are, you'll surely love this one. They have every kind of Chinese dish you can imagine: General Tao's chicken, beef and broccoli, veggie delight, fried rice.......  You'll even find a few non-Chinese selections, like a salad station, baked potatoes and French fries. The dessert station was pretty weak. Carrot cake, brownies, white cake and pudding. There's also a vanilla frozen yogurt machine, although they don't offer any toppings. Who doesn't have chocolate sauce for frozen yogurt?  I really have no desire to go back again.",

It was a nice touch to see a steak cooking station but I had to order it 3 times before I actually got mine and it still wasn't cooked right.

So to start the year off my employer decided to take all of us out to eat at Lin's Buffet.  How nice.  The gesture that is.  I normally hate, loathe, buffets because I don't want my food sitting out with people picking over it. Not cool.  Well, yeah, that's just it.   First, if you are gluten free or have any other diet restriction...STAY AWAY!  This place has very little to offer for you to eat.  I basically had veggies, fruit, and hard boiled eggs.  Second, I went to the bathroom when I first arrived, and there was NO SOAP. WTF. Strike one and two.  I quickly thought about how many people use the bathroom and probably didn't wash I was I appealed. After I used my pink to open the door I luckily found a colleague who had wipes or hand sanitizer.    All in all mediocre food. Extremely crowded. Non dietary restriction friendly. Smh.  I'm just glad I didn't have to pay.",

The employees were all very friendly and they were very attentive, the food was actually very flavorful and very good, it has Mongolian barbecue and a sushi station.  The upside to this buffet is that you can eat as healthy or as bad as you would like. For a Chinese buffet in a marginal area of town is actually remarkably very clean. It is definitely worth checking out. There's no way to give a buffet five stars so this will get a solid four star from me. When you take into consideration the price you really can't beat it.

She enjoyed it and I liked that it did not hugely dent my wallet.

Then couldn't get refills or ice.  We won't be back.  And I'll make sure all of my people know why too.

I got it medium rare and it was really tasty. Couldn't go wrong with that one.  Another thing that was good and I took notice was the service on my drinks. I think their name was Andrew.

    "text": "**Please note that while I am giving them 4 four stars, I feel that many other people would feel like my experience should be a 3 star review**  First of all, you need to remember that buffets generally tend to be kind of poor quality. With that in mind, I feel like the food at Lin's is above average compared to other buffets. This is good because I would say that Lin's is about $3-5 more expensive than other similar buffets. A two person meal with drinks and tax came to $28.00.   While the food was of good quality, there were a TON of chicken options. I point this out because if someone doesn't like chicken they may not enjoy their experience. I personally feel that there were enough non-chicken items (which were also of good quality) to make this issue relatively minor. For non chicken choices, there were: many types of fruit, several types of spring rolls, a FEW beef/pork options, a good selection of seafood (shrimp, salmon, octopus, and sushi).   The dessert choices were probably the most disappointing aspect of the food there. There were several types of pudding, jello, fruit, pastries, cookies, brownies, and soft serve ice cream. While this may seem not seem too terrible, I do have several complaints. First, the brownies were horrible tasting. I am by no means picky, but I feel like a box of store brand brownies that were burned badly would have tasted better. There was simply no flavor whatsoever! The selection of pastries was meager and the pastries were not all that good (very simple, small ones) and they tasted rather mediocre. I have the same complaint with the cookies. All I could see were plain old-sugar cookies! Furthermore, it didn't look like they had run out of cookies, it looked like that was all they had!   The service was acceptable, I'd give it a 3.5 rating. While it was not as attentive as I'd like it to be, it did seem better than what other people have described! Otherwise, the staff was polite, friendly, and helpful.   The actual facilities are quite nice for a buffet, very clean well-lit, and organized. Although I did notice several booths had holes in the cushions, the majority of the furniture/fixings seemed to be in excellent repair: clean and relatively new!  While I'd recommend this buffet to other people, I'd let them know that most of the main dishes available are chicken dishes and that the dessert options might not be to their satisfaction.",

    "text": "Not my favorite buffett.  Sushi was bland and not many choices.  Steak was overcooked (I told him medium rare and it was almost well done). Mongolian grill was good.  The rest of the choices are your normal selection. It was quite busy, which in a buffett is a very good thing (food gets changed out faster).  You do pay before you go even sit down, so be aware.  Also, there is potatoe salad right by the pudding. Be careful, as I almost screwed that up.",

Price was fair for dinner, as it was $27 for the both of us.  I was really impressed with this one.  Some of the features that they have here are a Sushi station, a mongol ion BBQ area, plenty of desserts, and plenty of food for all to eat.  They also had quite the desert spread as well.  One of the better buffet's I've seen in town.  If your in the area, definitely go check this place out. Really worth it!",
