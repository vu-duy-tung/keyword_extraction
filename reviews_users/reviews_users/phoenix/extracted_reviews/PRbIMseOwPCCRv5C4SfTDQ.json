We ordered the fried okra as our app which was pretty good (but what doesn't taste good fried!?). We ordered the backyard platter, pulled beef & portobello sandwich and a rack of ribs. The chicken that came in the platter was really moist and good and everyone was pretty happy with their meals (btw their sweet potato fries are pretty good). Service was okay considering how busy they were.",

This was more like 4:1 (all bread). Moral of the story, I think I should order bbq next time if I'm at a bbq place.  -The bbq sauces are good, very molasses-based (except the Memphis-style one), and delicious. Kyle's pulled pork sandwich was delectable.   -Nice sides. Authentic braised greens, delicious corn on the cob, watermelon slices, shoestring french fries, mac n cheese, cheesy grits-- all looked great.   The prices kind of stopped me in my tracks, to be honest. I kind of saw the place as more of a Red-Robin type stop, but most dishes here are at least $15, even sandwiches.",

Anyway...we went to Lucille's after my daughters graduation ceremony so we figured it would be busy with other families headed there. Boy, were we right.  We waited in the little room off the bar, with a beer, which was nice and relaxing. Table took about 35 minutes.   After we were seated everything else took FOREVER.  I heard several severs apologizing for waiting. We ordered drinks and apps at the same time because we figured we wouldn't see our server for a while! Fried pickles and onion straws were good. Not great, but good. What seemed an eternity later our food came. Long story short: brisket-good, pulled pork- fatty, chicken-dry with good flavor. Mac and cheese- soso, sweet potato fries- average. Jambalaya-meh, baked potato- yummy, sugary biscuits-weird. Bill- I have no idea because my dad paid. Thanks dad!!   Will I be back? Maybe, but will probably give some other BBQ a chance first.",

I even shipped some to my MIL in Detroit. I highly suggest the Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich - and if you go at lunch you can get it for a few bucks cheaper. My husband always gets ribs and is never disappointed. The fried okra comes with a spicy sauce in which you will also want to dip your other foods.   My kids always get the kids' chicken fingers and never have to take a bite home (which is unusual because they are such picky eaters). The biscuits with apple butter are one of the best items on the menu. I have also had the banana pudding which is delicious, but nothing special. I have had better from authentic Southern home cooks. You will leave having to unbutton your pants because you are so full. I highly suggest not eating for hours and hours before you go - you will want to indulge.   Typically, we are seated right away. Only one time did we have to wait, but the restaurant is still full all the time. The prices are a bit high, but worth it.",

Our waiter was excellent and very friendly (he even gave my aunt a back massage when she jokingly asked for one when he asked if we needed anything else).  The food wasn't too expensive for what it is supposed to be. Pricing is reasonable.  Food quality was sub par for everyone in the party.  We ordered beef and pork ribs as well as a steak and some shrimp.   Appetizers were delicious, but the meats were very underwhelming.  Two of the people in our group left feeling queasy from the odd tasting sauce on their ribs.  The biscuits and butter were fantastic though, and I may go back just to have the spinach dip appetizer and biscuits one night.  Maybe we went on an off night.",

Apparently not so anymore.  Four of us split the Lucille's Appetizer Platter which is basically a sampling of all of the appetizers.  This was good, but then again it's hard to go wrong with fried food.  It's the meat that they really screwed up on.  I ordered the tri tip sandwich, which I describe as slices of beef jerky on a dried out potato bun with a little BBQ sauce.  Funny thing is, beef jerky is exactly how a friend described his steak, which he ordered to be cooked medium and it came out well done.  The only meat that anyone ordered that was moist and tasty was the chicken.  The service wasn't the best.  We were promised biscuits but we had to remind one of the four different servers we had that they still hadn't come out more than halfway into our meal.  Maybe it was just a bad night for dry, overcooked meat, but given the location, prices and lack of stellar service, I definitely won't be returning.",

The atmosphere is cute and I am more than sure that we are paying for where they are located...  That said, I loved the rolls w the apple butter. I have never been a fan of apple butter, but this place has made me think twice now.  Service was good, but man, was it crowded...That'll teach me to come here on a Saturday (even though this review is written almost a week later!).",

Overall, I had a great meal, drink, and was welcomed by excellent staff and will definitely come back again.",

    "text": "So disappointed with my experience tonight that I'll likely never return to this location again and question if I will continue to patronize the chain at all.  I've been to 6 or 8 of their locations and have ALWAYS without question had a great experience both in terms of food quality and service.  Tonight however was different.  I walked into my home town Lucille's and was smugly 'greeted' by some half hazard welcome.  The guy serving as host was less than friendly but managed to ask me how many in my party?  One, I replied ..from here he speaks into his headset microphone to summons someone to come seat me.  He hands her my soon to be menu and says 'put him in the bar'.  Now there are many times that I prefer to sit in the bar, but tonight just wasn't one of them and furthermore I would just prefer to have been asked if this option was ok.  I had just landed from a week long business trip and stopped by Lucille's to have dinner to allow the traffic to die down.  I might also add that I was dressed in business attire .. I didn't look like some bum off the street and couldn't understand why I couldn't have a regular table with the others.  I was shuffled off to the bar where I was offered one of the high top tables.  My money is obviously not good enough to rent one of the 30+ empty dining room tables for 20 - 30 minutes.  It was 5:15 pm by the way ... it was ahead of the prime busy dinner period of 6pm, etc.  Every single high top table was empty also to give you an idea of how busy the place was.  I didn't want a high top table so I asked for something else .. I was offered some random 6-top table sitting right in the entrance of the bar .... I'm one person .. WHY would I want a 6-top table?  Well, obviously again my money is simply not welcome for a dinning room table with the common folk.  I didn't want this large table or its poor location ... so my third and final option was the booth right out of the kitchen .. it was obvious that there was no way that I was going to get one of those seemingly high demand empty dinning room tables.  I asked the girl that seated me why I was not given a choice if I wanted to sit in the bar.  She became a bit defensive and said 'that's why I asked you if wanted to sit here or over there' ... NO, not you .. I wanted to know why the rude guy that told you to seat me in bar didn't give me a choice.  What if I was a recovering alcoholic .. doesn't matter .. you are only 1 person and their perception is that you wouldn't tip enough to get a dinning room table.  Reality is I tip very well .. and I know what I want, order fast, and I'm out of there .. IF there was demand for the tables they would have been better off to put me in the dinning room as I would have allowed them to turn the table over more quickly than a family coming in for a night of chatting and occupying the table.  Whatever ...  After I sat in my assigned bar booth for nearly 15 minutes without anyone even approaching my table I finally gave up and took my unworthy self out the front door ...  It's really sad to see how quickly the service is fading at this restaurant ....  Sad, Sad, Sad ....  I made my way down the parking lot to The Keg ,, incidentally, I tipped my server (who was phenomenal)  $20 on a $42 dinner.  The whole experience as enjoyable starting with walking in the door and being treated with a smile and a warm welcome. When the hostess asked how many in my party and I replied 'one' she then asked, would you prefer to be seated in our dining room or lounge area?  Obviously I opted for the dinning room.",

    "text": "Solid BBQ.  Great Southern treats.  Yummy biscuits and Apple Butter!  Now the reasons you may want to reconsider:  -- Extreme Portions.  This may be a good thing for some, but I found myself feeling very wasteful about half-way through the meal.  There was simply no way I was going to finish, and since I was planning to walk around the Marketplace afterwords - I knew the food wouldn't keep.  -- Extreme Prices.  We dropped in with the kids, because we thought it would be family friendly and moderately priced.  Imagine my surprise when I opened the menu.  All the entree's were $20+  Even kids meals were $8 dollars... better mortgage the house if you want to get drinks too!  -- Better Options.  Yes, this place is great.  But for the price, I could find comparable spots to eat.  The main advantage to Lucille's is that it is barbecue in the right location (Tempe Marketplace).",

So the other waitress who served us that dish said she was going to put the brisket as the side.

Love the two meat combo; I usually get the ribs (they have 3 types: baby back, St. Louis and beef - all 3 are good and the beef are huge), burnt ends (sometimes they are overly burned) or pulled pork. They have 4 different BBQ sauce bottles on each table so you can really pick and choose your exact taste.  Several of the sides are good including the baked potato (pretty good sized), corn on the cob, Mac and cheese (it's plain), and baked beans (served in a nice little very hot cup).   Beer selection is ok, not too many craft selections but I don't think that's their audience and they have some house beers so maybe they're trying to get you to go with theirs. They have a beer flight and I'd recommend it, not just to try some of their house brews but the price is pretty good. They make a good mule (4 mule options to choose from), and their coolers are good also.   I'm a dessert person and believe I've tried each that they have - they are all good. My personal favorite is the peach cobbler. It's pretty large, has a nice hard top crust with a great soft under, nice amount of peaches. Really yummy, and if you didn't save room they can pre-box it for you to take home with the check :)",

They start you off with biscuits and an apple butter, but ask for the honey to eat with the biscuits.   There is such a large selection of ribs, the beef ribs are huge,  baby back are always good but I prefer the St Louis Ribs because of the size and how juicy and tendor that they are always served. You also choose 2 sides which all are good. My favorite are corn bread,  mac and cheese,  corn on the cob and baked potato.   If you order a drink it comes in a mason jar with unlimited refills.  The restaurant looks like you are in the South and I love the leg lamp by the restroom like in \"A Christmas Story\".  What ever you order you can't go wrong everything is always excellent.

    "text": "Generally I love Lucille's,we've come here on many family occasions. It's also kinda hard to find places that serve beef ribs instead of pork. Stopped in for lunch since it had been a while and the service and food were really lacking. Our waitress was monotone when talking to us, she asked us if we had been there before and said \"welcome back\" so depressing. When we had questions about the menu answers were short and the service, especially when most people are in a hurry at lunch time, it was really slow here so it prevented us from wanting to get items we would have normally ordered or wanted to. I just ended up getting the spinach dip and it was swimming in oil. Tried pouring some out but it kept accumulating, I could t even finish it and my fingers felt so greasy after every chip. Love their apple butter, sweet tea, and beef ribs and generally having dinner here goes well, service has always been pretty slow since I first came here, still is, but lunch the other day they were not at their best all the way around, more disappointed in the food quality than anything.",

We were told the wait time was going to be an hour long, so we opted to sit at the bar (open seating). We found an open table, but it had not been bussed yet so we stood and waited 10 minutes before someone came over to bus the table. Sat there for another 10-15 minutes and waited for the waitress to come take our order. By that time we had already decided that on what we wanted to order. Waitress finally came up and asked us what we would like to drink, placed our drink order and as I'm still talking, informing her that we already know what we want, she just walks off. We waited another 10 minutes for our drinks and placed our order. 30 minutes later we were still waiting for our appetizer and just decided to leave. Upon informing them that we were leaving, they did offer us to speak to a manager.....but by that time, clearly seeing a pattern, we surmised we'd be waiting again to speak to a manager. So we just left. Food is good, they need better service.",

Pulled pork-above average Brisket-above average Burned Ends-Excellent Pork Ribs-average.  The best item they have on the menu is their Beef ribs.  Oh my.  You cant get beef ribs at a lot of bbq joints, but Lucilles have the best in the valley.  They used to charge by half a rack or a full rack, now they charge by the bones.  (3,5,7)  The prices have gone up alot recently, but still you can't get beef ribs anywhere else that's close to theirs.  The sides are ok, nothing to rave about.  The biscuits are good with the cinnamon butter.  Also the strawberry lemonade is amazing.  It's like crack in a mason jar.  It's the best.",

    "text": "High profile BBQ in Tempe marketplace that is way over priced for my taste.  I'm from Colorado so I know what good BBQ tastes like and great cuts of meat.  Had the brisket which was dry and not well cut.  The beans, on the other hand, were awesome!    This restaurant is more notably known for its ribs (based on the fact that everyone else was ordering it) and the price was upwards of $30 for a full rack.  Normally, I would say that is ridiculous to pay for ribs, but if they are that good I would gladly pay that.    I will be going back to try the ribs of course and may change my review based on that.  But for now this review is a 3 star because of the dry brisket.  Only reason this was not a 2 star is because of the service which I rarely care about in a review.  But here, when a 2 top spends upwards of $80 on a bill for mediocre meats,  you better believe your going to get good service and it was!  Props to all that serve there and management that trains them.  D- for the staff that chooses the meats and length of time to cook good BBQ.",

I give it an A+ in that department. Ambiance of the restaurant was cool, a little different but fun to look at the decorations.  On the other hand the food was just alright. I ordered the bbq sliders one of each: pork, beef, and chicken with a side of bbq beans. The beans tasted different than normal beans that I have had before, they had more of a smokey flavor. The sliders were alright. The chicken one was by far the best out of the 3 different sliders because it was the most moist one. Overall just a mediocre place. I didn't walk away from the restaurant saying \"that was the best BBQ I've ever had!\"",

I love this place! Food is always great.  The people have been more than welcoming,  What more could you want with a BBQ place. We even had our bachelor and bachelorette party here in October 2014.  8 years later. I still loved this place until this afternoon (3/28/2015). My husband and I went in and ask the host if we could have a booth.  \"Of course walk this way\" She took us to the back in the far back. My husband set down, immediately I was going to sit down but it was really warm from the location we were being seated in. I ask the host if we can sit in a different location. Closer to the hostess station it's cooler if you ever eaten here.  She said \"no that the rest of the seats were taken for reservations\" I asked if we could sit at the bar she says \" no all seats are taken for reservations\". At this point I knew what she was doing I told my husband that we are leaving and we would never come back and the host was like \"okay\".  I have never been so disgusted with somebody in my life. yes I am White female, and my husband is Hispanic  This host was playing out the race card! I would have talk with the general manager (Tammy) and she was there. But, it just not worth it anymore. Nobody in that establishment deserves my money or yours.",

The third time, she didn't even ask us if we needed anything. she straight ahead brought us the check.

With two people with big appetites we didn't even come close to finishing all of it! The chicken was flavorful and crispy. Now, to get onto the main star of the show... The biscuits! I am not normally a biscuit fan but oh my god these were like heaven. They come out warm with sugar on top and are served with a apple cinnamon butter. I could eat just these and be incredibly happy!  We will definitely be back! Food was great and the servers were attentive and really nice!",

I am very picky when it comes to barbque because my husband is such a great cook! but.....this place was great! Yeah we had to wait awhile but it was worth the wait! The beef ribs and tri tip were great and I would recommend this place to everyone. It was a bit on the pricey side but well worth it!",

    "text": "The only reason this place doesn't get one star is my husband and mom, said their food and I quote \"wasn't terrible\".  My food was terrible, mostly because it was cold.    When we arrived we were seated quickly, and a waiter came and took our drink orders. Biscuits arrived and they were tasty, we ordered.  This ends the positive points in this experience.  I ordered a baked potato stuffed with pulled pork and a salad on the side.  My salad was soaked in dressing, it was a lot more dressing then salad.  My potato was completely cold the cheese had hardened on top creating a shell holding the cold pulled pork in.  The potato also had 2 large (visible since I didn't eat this cold item) bad spots that went fairly deep into the potato.  When I let the waiter know that my meal was cold he looked at me like I committed a cardinal sin and didn't even hint at an apology.  My mom and husband both got BBQ combos, between the two of them every possible choice was ordered.  Both said food was \"not terrible\" mostly at least it was hot.  I decided to go for a walk around the District instead of watching them eat, since I now had zero interest in trying anything off the menu.  The manager came by and offered a free dessert.  When I came back she walked by twice and didn't once stop to offer an apology.  We were not charged for my meal (since I didn't eat it) but for two lunches ordered off the lunch menu our bill came to $40 which I think is high, especially considering the quality of food.   Topping off our lunch was the 20 minutes it took from when the waiter was handed our check until when it was brought back.  This is way too long, especially since the restaurant was not even busy.  Will not be back, and do not recommend.",

They have the best Strawberry Lemonade in town and their Red Velvet Cake is divine. For appetizers you've got to try their BBQ Wings and our favorite dish is the Pulled Pork Sandwhich. The service is wonderful here because they don't just assign one waiter to you, anyone in a black Lucille's work tshirt will help you. We love their basket of sweet biscuits and butter they give each table before chow time. Being centered at the Tempe Marketplace, near shopping and Harkins Theatre, makes it a family favorite.",

Ribs and chicken have been overcooked and the portions can't be rated as generous in any sense of the word.  Beverages, on the other hand, are generously but roughly prepared. A martini, for example, takes some crafting to prepare properly. Mine was mixed by someone doing a boot-scootin' line dance. The ambiance of Lucille's is wonderful if gawd-awful blaring country music is your preference.",

But their Garden Burger and their Portobello Mushroom Burger are really delicious. The side options are all also really yummy--and vegetarians usually have to rely on sides at BBQ and steak places. The carnivores in my family seem to enjoy all the meat stuff. My son loves the ribs. My husband loves the burgers and the brisket. My parents love the BBQ chicken. The service is usually pretty good--more often good than bad. The worst experience I've ever had there was with our kids and some friends and their small child on a Saturday--apparently live music night--where we got seated literally right next to the band. It made family dinner conversation a little challenging. But, hey, the food was good!",

    "text": "Continuing on my \"kid free\" weekend, I went over ot Tempe Marketplace to return something at one of the stores there.  I suddenly realized that the only thing I had to eat was popcorn at the movie and that was over 4 hours ago.  So, I stated to think about what was at the Marketplace in terms of being \"kid free\" and having a decent dinner.    I don't mind dining alone but on a Saturday evening when there are lots of families and dates going on, I'd rather not sit in the dining room alone so I bellied up to the bar.  It was pretty empty.  There was one other guy at the bar so I figured the bar tender would see me pretty fast.  Not the case, I waited about 5 minutes before I was acknowledged by someone other than the bartender.  I asked for some water and told him I was looking over the drink menu, not sure what I wanted yet.  Another 5 minutes went by and the bar tender came over, I ordered my drink and he asked if I would be having dinner.  I said yes so he got a menu.  I was somewhat taken aback by the prices.  I thought it was a tad bit expensive.  Since it was just me and I was giving myself a treat I thought, ok, just once.....unless it is just amazing bbq....you never know.  I finally made my decision and ordered 1/2 slab of baby back ribs.....it's bbq and that's usually how I gauge my bbq, by the ribs.    My food came out piping hot.  The roll that was severed with the meal was flaky on the outside and tender inside.  The cinnamon butter was delish and a nice compliment.  I was never asked if I wanted another though.  I dug into the mac and cheese and it was hot and gooey with a nice flavor.  I got sweet potato fries too.....I know, I love carbs!  Wish I didn't but I don't have many vices.  :)  Those were tasty as well, hot and crisp. And now for the ribs. They were good.  Moist and tender, fall off the bone goodness.  The sause had a tiny bit of sweetness to it that I liked.  The Dbacks were playing the Dodgers and not doing so well so I took solice in my ribs.    The atmosphere here is cute.  Down home southern style and comfy.  They had a blues combo playing in the bar and they were pretty darn good I must say.  The music made me feel better about watching the Dbacks loose to the Dodgers.  UGH!    The service was just ok. Considering I was one of just two other people at the bar,   I could have been greeted faster.  I had a margarita that tasted a bit off to me.  And I felt that was pretty expensive too.  The food was good but for the price I can go other places and get something just as good.  In this economy I've got to save my pennies.  I also thought the service was lacking.  I would not have been pleased at all if I had been in the dining room.  But then again, one of two people at the bar and I wasn't greeted with a minute?  Not sure I will go back.....but thanks anyway.",

A year or so later, I visited the restaurant at Tempe Marketplace and was not impressed. I waited almost 20 minutes to place an order then waited another 25-30 minutes for the food. I understand restaurants get busy but that's ridiculous. When I returned home, I found that my order was incomplete, I definitely was not driving back to the restaurant.  I ordered the sliders which seemed a bit dry with not much taste. The cornbread and biscuits were okay but that's pretty much it. Considering the cost, the amount of time it took to order and obtain my food and the quality of the food, I will be exploring other restaurants for BBQ.",

First of all our food was not cold, not warm, but is was definitely COOL to the touch. Plus the place aint cheap. Our meal came to $60.55. And we didn't even finish our food. Wait, take that back.  The Biscuits w/Apple Butter were the best thing we ate of the meal. Wish we had went ahead and went to LoLo's instead. Wont be back to Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ. I liked Famous Dave's better.

We eat out less and we are picker than we used to be.... BUT I think these guys are taking short-cuts too. I used to LOVE the fried chicken meal. OMG you get two HUGE pieces of chicken on top of mashed potatoes. I would end up with left overs or my stomach hurt. We went there for my birthday. The chicken was burnt on the edges. The potatoes were slightly warm at best. I ordered one of those fancy drinks. I am not much of a drinker anymore, so usually one is enough to make me buzz. This thing was 7 bucks and had so very little alcohol in it. It tasted good, but darn I should of just got the sweet tea! At least it doesn't pretend to be alcohol. I really feel this place has gone down hill. They are pretty pricey. I don't have a problem paying if I think I got good food. I USED to here. We rather go to Honey Bears now. They are good for half the price!.........UPDATE....... Ownership did contact me and offer me a gift card so I would try again. I will post when I do. I was impressed with them caring.",

It's nice to me that you can see the smoker working, and the smoke flavor is present in the food and appetizing. I found the baby back ribs to be tasty but a little sparse on meat (I should have gone with St. Louis style). The brisket is great, but a little dry - easily fixed with a bit of sauce. The sides I've tried are all very good. I just find the price a little too high, so I can't say \"I'm a fan\". $28 for a rib-meat combo, $3 for a soda and $4 for a lemonade make it a good destination for an occasional dinner, but their competition in the valley are all under $20 for similar portions.",

If I wanted a shot of tequila I would've asked for it. Also I ordered the chicken pasta. I wasn't really in the mood for steak. But I should've ordered steak instead. When I ate my pasta it looked so good. Had mushrooms, bell peppers but as I began eating it it was rather bland. And when I bit into the chicken I tasted a bland piece of chicken breast or whatever part of chicken that was probably just boiled in a big pot with absolutely no seasoning. It was so bad I had to return it. I just couldn't eat it. Instead I ordered some mashed potatoes and finished my sons baby ribs which were probably the best thing I ate that day.

Meat was extremely tender, great smoked favor and the bbq sauce and the mop sauce were really good. Loved the cheesy grits! Biscuits were great too.  Went back  Saturday for lunch and was disappointed to find no lunch specials on the weekend. Due to the price of two items at regular pricing I chose only the baby back ribs. For sides I chose potato salad  and the honey peanut slaw. Potato salad was o.k., but the peanut  slaw was great! It's a vinegar based slaw and reminds me of an Asian type slaw with a little sweet and a little sour.  I've had a lot of BBQ around the states and this is one of my favorites.  Service was great,",

    "text": "I usually come here every 3 months or so for lunch as it is close by one of my doctor's offices. I recently dined here around noon on 5/23/19 (Thursday). It was quite busy for lunch and there were not really enough staff to handle it I don't think. We requested a booth because I have an injury so it's easiest for me and most comfortable. The only option was to sit in the bar booths or the one right at the front door area of the restaurant where everyone was entering and waiting to be seated. In the past, we've been sat in the back booths when none of the others were available however the back booths were not given as an option this time around. We chose the front booth and it was very noisy, not relaxing and crowded for the entire meal. Our server was quiet and not overly friendly. Which is kind of a bummer because we've had really amazing service here in the past, I mean really awesome!! The food maybe seemed to go downhill from the last time I visited? Their fried chicken is really amazing usually but this time it really felt short, I only ate a few bites. I was even disappointed with the sides, their seemed to be no flavor with any of them. My mom said her Arnold Palmer tasted like soap. We both felt sick the next day after eating here which has never happened and we both ordered the same dish Such a bummer, used to really love this place! Maybe we just caught them on a bad day? Not too sure what happened here.",

The Ribs were overcooked, Burnt End were very bad and sides are too small, there chicken was pretty good. Server was OK but never checked in until he thought we were done. IMO there just going thru the BBQ motions and take no pride in there meats, no pit master would destroy meat like this. They need to hire a real Pit Master that knows how to read the meat on the smoker. Oh well, there are some real good mom and pop BBQ joints in the  valley, I'll go there for my BBQ fix or smoke my own",

I picked up my sides the guest LOVED the Mac and cheese and the potato salad and all was well.   I used to live in the Phoenix area but now live in Georgia, but every time I visit my sister and new niece (yayyyy) I will visit Lucille's. You guys rock!  Thank you!   I love this place!",

    "text": "This place has lovely decor and ambience, but they are VERY expensive for a BBQ joint.    I came in just before the dinner rush and was seated in the bar area, which I always hate.   I had a desire for ribs, but those START at $31, so I ordered the tri tip dinner, which was also a bit pricy. Ordered a soft drink to go with it. The drink was large, thankfully. The server was loud, obnoxious and acted like I was really bothering her and holding her up when asked what was on the wedge salad. Acted like I should KNOW this when it can vary greatly from restaurant to restaurant. This attitude is inexcusable; it wasn't an unreasonable question and I have food allergies.  The dinner was just OK and the meat was on the dry side in some spots. I've had better BBQ at Dickey's for far less money and a LOT less attitude.  Next time I'm in the mood for ribs, I'll go to Rustler's Roost and Dickey's when I want good ole BBQ brisket.",

For my first visit I had the backyard family feast that feeds a family of 4, however it really would feed a group of 6-8! You get 4 sides and your choice of 2 racks of ribs and 2 half bbq chicken!   The second family feast is Lucille super feast, serves 10.  You get 3 racks of bbq ribs , 4 half chickens, 6 sides, and a salad! My family and I celebrated my nieces 21st birthday (party of 15) This feast would serve up to 14-16 ! We definitely had a lot of left overs!  Customer service is always great when we are there ! For our party we didn't know they would give us a closed off part of the restaurant just to accommodate and make everything comfortable for us!",

    "text": "Fun location, huge portions, and a Tootsie Roll pop to top off the meal.  I debated 3 or 4 stars for Lucille's. I had settled on 3.5 stars and was trying to decide whether to round up or down. Although I had initially decided to go with 3 stars simply as a matter of the pricing (it's on the pricey side, despite portion sizes), I went with rounding up for a couple of reasons: First, I have a lot of good memories of dining here. I have eaten here several times, and every time I have, it's been with my family. My brother gets excited about coming to this place, and I always enjoy myself when I'm here. Second, there are Tootsie Roll Pops as the after-dinner treat sitting near the hostess stand. I'm a bit of a sucker for Tootsie Roll Pops, so maybe this is a bit of a biased review. That said, I'll do my best to describe my experiences here.  The location is a lot of fun. There are a number of rooms to the place, and it goes on for a while. There are some enclosed patio areas that make you feel a little like you're dining on the patio of a house. There is actual outdoor seating as well, and they enclose it with some heaters when it cools off during the winter. There is a bar with TVs, so it's good for watching sports events. And there are a bunch of posters and other little trinkets up on the wall to give it some character. If nothing else, there are a few conversation starters in the place.  The service has always been decent. There is usually a bit of a wait on busy nights, but they will take your number and text you when it's your turn, so you can wander around Tempe Marketplace a bit while you're waiting. The service is generally attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. It can sometimes take a while to get your food here, especially when it's busy. I think we may have waited for close to 30 minutes the last time I was here after ordering. But then again, I didn't look at my watch, so this is just a guess based on how hungry I was.  While you wait for the entree, they bring out some delicious biscuits with honey butter. This is a great little (or not so little) snack while you're waiting for the main show. I could probably make a meal out of these things alone, but I try to resist eating too much of them before I get my food. There are a number of good appetizers as well. I've had the fried okra and a few other items--all good. But this last time, we had the BBQ chips, and I must say that I really enjoyed them. I am not normally a big potato chips fan, but these were freshly made and delicious! They come out with some Ranch for dipping, but they're good to me just plain.  Finally, the entrees. These are all big servings, so be prepared to eat. While they have a number of BBQ options (all pretty decent, with lots of side options--they pass the brisket test for me, and that's my favorite BBQ option), I'd suggest going for some of the Southern specialties. The fried chicken and mashed potatoes are particularly good. The catfish, both in fried and blackened form, is a great choice as well. I've tried a number of the entrees here, and I haven't gone wrong yet. The food isn't fantastic, but it's pretty solid.  Honorable mention: The teas they serve here are quite delicious. Both the peace and watermelon iced teas are really refreshing, and I'm not typically a fan of iced tea.  I'll keep coming back, but not on a regular basis because of the price. It's an experience here.",

We had a very large group so I am also posting the review for my meat eating friends also because there weren't many veggie options available besides sides.  My favorite thing here were the biscuits.  They were addictive! The Dixie Sweet Tea was good!  I did not like the Flame Roasted Artichoke app.  It was really dry and had no seasoning.  I expected it to be meatier (like the way artichoke is in a dip).  The Southern Fried Okra and Fried Green Tomatoes were a little too greasy for my taste.  More breading would have set them off!   My friends said the wings were just ok, they needed more sauce on them.  My friend's mom had the Grilled Salmon; she said she enjoyed it.  My friend said his Po Boy Sandwich was \"ok\".  He went to school in New Orleans so he had high expectations. For dessert, I had the Snickers Ice Cream Pie. I was pretty underwhelmed.  It had a somewhat gritty texture, too many peanuts and was soupy.  I wanted to score Lucille's higher but too many \"OKs\" across the board.  No one was excited about their dishes.  And to me BBQ (with creole/cajun influence) is definitely supposed to be exciting! The pluses: Nice servers, the portions are very generous and as I mentioned before, we really enjoyed the biscuits.",

The last THREE TIMES (we purchased coupons that were non-refundable) were terrible experiences.  Brisket ends were fatty and greasy, hamburger was a dried out hockey puck, onion straws were over-cooked, pulled pork was a major disappointment. We have been to this restaurant so many times and recommended it highly. Something has happened to take away from the quality. Prices have also been increased.",

Update 06/27/2016 - We gave Lucille's another shot this past weekend and we were impressed with the service compared to our past experiences.

We thought we'd give it another try on this visit.  We had 12 adults and one teenager in our group. We shared the Super Feast said to be good for 10 or more.  It came with \"Choice of three racks of baby back, St. Louis or beef ribs and four half BBQ chickens, with your choice of two pounds of two of the following; sausages, tri tip, pulled pork, rib tips or brisket burnt ends, a large tossed green salad, plus your choice of six sides. Served family-style.\" It was Yummy! The portions are very generous, we had enough leftover meat to fill a medium sized foil tray.   They had several on table bottled sauces with different levels of spicy. Sauce on the food was thicker and drier (in a good way) than that of Armadillo Willie's and less tangy than that of Phil's; it was finger licking good.  Service was very good and always with a good attitude and a smile; refills of our drinks sometimes came before we asked.  We will come again during our next visit.",

    "text": "Went to Lucille's for the first time yesterday, a Tuesday evening. The food was good but not as good as I had expected. The service was terrible, at best, which is why I give Lucille's 2 stars. Had the service been at least decent I would have given 3 stars. We were seated promptly and then patiently waited about 10 minutes before someone finally came by to take a drink order. Then, we waited at least 15 more minutes for our drinks to arrive at which time the waiter informed us that they work on team service and to feel free to grab anyone if we needed anything. We finally ordered our food which arrived fairly quickly but in the mean time our drinks were empty for at least another 10 minutes. We tried getting the attention of other servers but apparently vacuuming and wiping off tables was a higher priority than we were. So we got our food which was good but nothing special and while we were still eating, the waiter came back and asked if we had saved room for chocolate cake. Since we were still eating, we declined. Then, he brought the check right back and asked if we wanted a to go box! It felt like he wanted us to leave for some reason. So I left a card with the check and then waited almost 10 more minutes for him to come back with the receipt. All in all, not an enjoyable dining experience. I may decide to give it one more shot someday but if I do, it won't be any time soon. The manager should rethink the team service aspect b/c I think it essentially lowers the quality of service for the customers.",

All in all it was ok, until we went to pay the check.  We were a large group and paid with cash and a credit card.  When we got the bill to sign, we realized he did not apply the full $100 in cash that we gave along with the credit card.  When we questioned the waiter, he got very defensive and pulled $40 out of his POCKET and said we only gave $40.  WTH? Why is it in his pocket and not the register??  We were adamant that we gave $100, he went inside and came back 10 min later with his Manager and apologized for the mix up.  The waiter said someone found it on the floor, while the Mgr said another waiter found it in the bill folder.  So which is it?  We thought we had the bill squared away until we checked our credit card online and we were charged the full amount 2x and now they won't provide a credit.  This really soured our experience, I've never seen anything like this before.  The food was ok but after this business with the check, I don't think we can go back.  Hopefully the credit card company can clear up the discrepancy.",

Smoked salmon sounded like a good choice considering they smoke thier meats on the premise.  So after all I was looking forward to the meal.  Disappointment #1 they didn't have smoked salmon my first choice.  Disappointment #2 they didn't have the simple syrup to make the drink I ordered.  #3 The fried catfish and shrimp were serverd hot that's the best thing I can say about the entire meal.  HOT not tasty just hot.   #4 My cocktail was strong but far from the drink I expected.   #5 Why play with making mac and cheese, why?   I'm gonna stop counting - the braised spinach was sour , the sweet potatoe mash was pureed yams.  My niece took her chicken home an indication that it wasn't too bad.  She left the sliced beef on the plate.   We didn't order desert ....  We did walk down theb way for cupcakes.   My niece is moving back to California I promised to take her to dinner to un-celebrate her leaving me!  She picked this place, she should probaly question her to decision to leave she's not thinking straight.   The ultimate questions, will I go back?  \"N\" to the NO!",

Either somebody picked off my plate before it got to me or I just paid $20 for 3 or 4 forkfulls of dry brisket. I think they were supposed to be slices. It was more like a handful of brisket chips. They were tough and tiny. No flavor to them whatsoever. No mop sauce. No smoke. No taste. I had to put salt on it. Side dishes should not dwarf your entree. There was more corn and potatoes than there was beef. There's no beef shortage that I'm aware of, and this wasn't Kobe beef, so I have to question. I doubt very much that was 7 oz even pre-cooked weight. Apparently it was $20 corn and potatoes, and I didn't get any biscuits like it says it comes with. I'm fluent in TX and Southern BBQ. This is just ridiculous. I'm just gonna go to Rudy's next time. If I'm gonna pay $20 for brisket, there better be some brisket on the plate!",

While the biscuits with apple butter were delicious, everything else seemed to be standard affair.    My friend and I started with an order of fried pickles which ended up being overly salty.  For my entree, I ordered the brisket with sweet potato mash and cheese grits.  My friend had the ribs.  The portions were big and everything was hot and steamy but my brisket ended up being really dry and tough.  After slapping on some more bbq sauce, I was able to choke it down.  The sweet potato mash was delicious and the cheesy grits really hit the spot.  My friend had said his ribs were great so perhaps it just wasn't the right night for brisket and fried pickles.  Boo hoo!  I give Lucille's 3.5 stars at best.  There are plenty of other BBQ joints around the Chandler area that are more impressive and Lucille's just pales in comparison.  _____________________________________________  Side-Note:  I received a lovely message from the owner of Lucille's today to give them a second-try on the house.  While I appreciate their gracious offer, I must decline.  I thank the owner for his generosity though.  I admire his work ethics on trying to make sure all his customers are happy!  Very classy, sir.  Kudos for trying to kiss and make up!",

They bring it out in a huge mason jar and I drank almost the whole thing!  I ordered the brisket plate. My sides were corn on the cob, baked beans, and I ordered an extra side of cornbread. The brisket was cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth. They have 3 options of different kind of sauces on the table that you can pour over your meat. It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. I couldn't stop eating!  Our waiter was awesome and attentive. He even asked if we wanted some tea to go which I happily accepted! Lucile's is our new favorite place for some comfort food!",

    "text": "The only thing stopping me from giving Lucille's five stars, is my love for Bobby Qs, but that's for another review.  Lucille's is hidden away in the back lot of Tempe Marketplace but that has not in the least hindered their business.  What we got: Fried pickles, they came in wedges not slices and it was phenomenal except for the bit where the juice from the pickle will burn your mouth if you're not careful.  I wasn't too impressed by their wings and probably wouldn't be getting them again.  For our entrees, we had 1) salad, which seemed nothing out of the ordinary.  2) A full rack of baby back ribs, dont even bother getting half a rack cause its never worth it. It comes with two sides and I was impressed that they give you an entire ear of corn instead of a third of one.  But I may be biased but Bobby Q's ribs are better, sorry Lucille.  3) The tri-tip sandwich was pretty damn amazing, though I was a little disappointed that it was on a regular burger bun especially after I saw the dressed up steak sandwich.  4) The steak sandwich was great in what I think was ciabatta and covered in arugula.  For me, what bumps them up from a 3 star to 4 star joint, is their service.  They had made a mistake with the steak sandwich and slathered mayo on both sides of the bread though we explicitly told them not to.  But when we brought it up to them, they immediately offered to replace it, took it off our bill, and to top that off, dessert was on the house.  We took up their offer and got the apple beignets which had too little apple for my liking but was a treat nonetheless.  All in all, amazing experience and I'll definitely be back!",

She would ask the rest of my table if they wanted a refill and would not bring the refills... I had to go in and get them myself. The food was tasteless and overpriced. We stressed to them that we needed to leave by 1:40 and they were very rude about it and we're still here waiting for our cards back to leave. Horrible... I won't ever come here again.. staff and the food SUCKED. (It was my first time coming here and it will definitely be my last)",

    "text": "Okay, let me be honest, I'm biased in favor of Texas Style BBQ - dry rub before being smoked and sauce always on the side, with sauce that is tomato and vinegar based, on the spicy side. Lucille's, while a well run establishment is more towards the the perspective of BBQ coming with sauce on it (even when i asked for the dry as a bone option on a beef rib it had been sauced and then grilled - good but certainly not \"dry\" BBQ). In addition, all the sauces seemed to be on the sweet side..  I will says the service was generally good and the watermelon ice tea, if nothing else I would stop in for a glass of that on a hot day, if I was in the area. In addition, this place is more of a BBQ as a specialty item with a price to match (they seem to charge on the high side), and I'm more in favor of hole in the wall joints like Little Miss BBQ down on University towards 32nd street.   One other thing that was exceptional was the hot link sausage - well grilled and more of the beef with black pepper flavor that epitomizes the BBQ sausage in Texas with its strong German roots.   Look, my view here is based on my personal tastes and I bet there are some people who will find this their complete cup of tea - if you like \"wet BBQ\" with a sweet sauce, and better yet, mustard based, this place is for you and I encourage you to get your own perspective. if nothing else a unique place to eat in the marketplace that seems to have a bit more authenticity than your average chain restaurant.",

For main, we ordered the meat combo platter - half order of ribs with the St.Louis rub and Tri Tip. I had the fries and garden veggies for the sides.I enjoyed the ribs way more than Tri Tip, but that was not too bad either. They also do serve their complimentary biscuits and butter, which just melts in your mouth! Their service was great, their servers work as a team so you don't have to wait for just that one person to get to you for everything. All in all, I had a great experience at Lucille's.

Food was good and service was just OK... They had placed us  in a corner and we didn't receive much attention although our group really didn't need any so that was good.        I had the Cajun shrimp with rice and vegetables. Somewhat underwhelming. Supposedly 1/2 pound of shrimp. I'll definitely pick something else next time I go.       On the bright side, the restaurant has very cool decor/ambience!",

That was about 9 months ago. We were in the area tonight and decided to give them another try. The first problem was a timing one. We had just started our salads when they brought out our hot food. Send it back to sit under the heat lamps? No thanks. We felt very rushed. Problem 2: I ordered the Alabama chicken with the sauce on the side. When they brought it, it was covered with the sauce with more on the side. I did send it back and they brought another one the way I ordered it. Problem 3: when the check came, we had been charged twice for the chicken.  The food was great, but otherwise...",

Of the sausages our favorite was the hot links. The pre-meal biscuits with sweet butter were a nice touch and $4 house beers hit the spot.  The drink menu was great as well.   If I were to have any negatives about the food, it would be that some of the meats came with sauce already on them. I think you can request no sauce but that should be the default.  Also, the prices are a bit steep for a chain bbq restaurant but, again, the food was delicious so we didn't have a problem with the final bill.",

We've been off the mainland for a few years and the visits to Lucille's have become few and far between.  Lucille's was not on the agenda when we left the house today, but all it took was the mention of the name and all five people in the car got immediately excited about lunch. And off we went.  Lucille's is always clean and smells amazing because of the variety of meats that are always cooking. We were seating quickly and then our server came right along to start working through our orders.  We had a great time hanging out while waiting for our meals, and an even better time once we had food in front of us. Everything was as delicious as we expected, and there is always enough for some sharing across the table.  After all of these years, and many visits to both AZ and CA locations, I am very happy to say that Lucille's remains one of my favorite restaurants and I recommend it without reservation to anyone who wants to enjoy some delicious bar-b-que or smoked meats.",

    "text": "I've been to Lucille's more than once.. this is probably visit #3.  I'm not a BBQ fan or a big meat eater.. but the man is.  This evening, we decided to subject my little sister and her family to BBQ eatin' out in AZ during our visit.  The place was quick to seat us, but I don't have much to say about the service.. it was slow to go.  We also had kids at our table and they were kept occupied by the various crayons and drawing paper offered.  Meals ordered and experience: Jambalaya - Too spicy.  It was like a bowl of cayenne pepper. BBQ Shrimp - Not too bad.. but a bit on the wet side (?)   Fried Chicken & Mashed Potatoes - the hubby enjoyed and LOVED his fried chicken.  Mashed potatoes were delishish. Blackened Catfish - not too bad.. but the collared greens that came with it were way too overdone... maybe that's the way they are supposed to be?  Catfish was MEH.  What more does one have to say about catfish?  It was spiced nicely.. but it still had the \"food produced in mass\" feeling. Kids Meals - No comment here.  Kids meals are kids meals  The experience was okay.. I can honestly say that I felt it was no different than going to an Outback Steakhouse, Elephant Bar or similar type restaurant.  The specialty is BBQ.. but I feel they are the \"good at BBQ\", but \"master of none\".  So it's a good experience for the hubs who likes that kind of food.  Bonuses:  The basket of biscuits with apple butter.  These were very good and I absolutely love them.  I think I should have just ate these for dinner.  The free refills, if you can ever get past the 32 oz jar of drink they give you...  But for my sister, brother in law and myself.. It's somewhat forgettable.",

Yeah, they give you a big mason jar to drink out of and biscuits with apple butter to start off. I recognized the biscuit but couldn't figure out what the sparkly stuff was on it, which turned out to be sugar. At first I didn't know what the apple butter was. Even after eating it, I later asked the server what was in it. The biscuit was dry and the combo was not Southern style.  Lucilles has Tri-Tip all over their menu. That made me chuckle because if Southerners knew where Tri-Tip originated from, you'd probably get shot. Stick to your Santa Barbara roots Lucille.    I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was delicious!!! My server recommened the Memphis style BBQ sauce and he was right - an excellent combination with the pulled pork.  The fries were nothing to write home about. I would have wanted fried okra with my meal, but that option is only available as an appetizer and not a side order. WTF?  I went for the peach cobbler for desert. I couldn't tell it was made with peaches. It seemed like a sweetened mass with a crumbly topping. Good cobbler is not that hard to make, not sure why the follow through wasn't there.   I wouldn't mind trying this place again. They smoke their own meats and they did well with my pulled pork. The rest of the meal was a little lacking. If the price for the main dishes weren't higher than giraffe tail, I'd come back again, but sorry Lucilles isn't on my return list.  The staff was friendly and I was able to get a weak wifi signal. Bathrooms were somewhat clean.",

We went last weekend for my birthday after we had a bad experience at Notorious P.I.G. in N Phoenix (terrible).  We ordered the super feast.  OMG.  It was $200 but could have fed close to 15 people.  We had nine.  It came with a large salad, biscuits and apple butter, 3 slabs of ribs, 2 whole chickens cut, 2 lbs of different meat options (we got 2 lbs of pulled pork and 2 lbs of tri tip (so delicious - my new fav), 6 sides (huge servings of sweet potatoes, cole slaw, fries, sp fries, corn on the cob and  mac and cheese) and we got sundaes for our birthday.  Everything was amazing and we had a ton of leftovers, probably a slab of ribs, a whole chicken, 4 corn on the bo halves, a quart of sweet potatoes, slaw and mac and cheese, pulled pork and tri tip.  I highly recommend this place to anyone.  I have yet to have anything I would not order again.  I would definitely recommend the trip tip and pulled pork.  The ribs are fall off the bone delicious.  You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "We went to Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que on 8/3/2012 at about 8 PM.  The decor was awesome and the wait was only 10 minutes without a reservation.  Service was a bit brusque but, hey, it was a Friday night.  Less forgivable was the dirty table.  The room was very loud but the music was good; and so we waited about 15 minutes for our drinks.  We ordered the \"Southern Fried Okra.\"it was OK. If you have never had real soul food or okra, you might like it.  But for anyone visiting Lucille's expecting down-home cookin, don't hold your breath.  It was left in the fyer too long and the oil needs changing.  Next up: the dinner biscuits and apple butter. Also very forgettable.  The biscuits were very doughy and pretty much just absorbed the saliva in my mouth.  Not sure if that was the goal to get me to buy some more overpriced iced tea....  House salads were underwhelming for the price and featured old lettuce, a dribble of dressing, and a whole lot of carrots. Apparently Lucille's knows how to mess up a HOUSE SALAD. Yep, now we're on a roll.  I got the half size \"New Orleans Gumbo.\" The top was congealed and was decorated with a blob of overlooked minute rice.  The presentation doesn't end there: there was a curious brown powder on the rice. I tried to smell this substance and discern what spice it might be, but, strangely, the dish had no real smell to it. Stranger yet, my \"gumbo\" had 3 pieces of shrimp in it.  The base of the dish tasted like a prepared packet of powdered brown gravy: sickeningly salty and bland.  Everything else in it was way overlooked and rubbery.  On a brighter side, my husband got the \"BBQ Tri Tip.\" I helped him with it since my meal was inedible and it was pretty awesome.  It was perfectly cooked and the Mop sauce that accompanied it was a great accompaniment.  A side note: his garlic mashed potatoes were devoid of any garlic, or taste for that matter.  Perhaps another powdered train-wreck: the only thing Lucille's did consistently.",

    "text": "So here I am, me and two of  My bfff's..just got done golfing 18 holes in 108 degrees. Needless to say we're all starving and thirsty.. After what felt like an hour we finally decided on some BBQ. Now we know plenty of hidden BBQ gems  throughout Phoenix but today we decided on Lucile's. So we get there and be bolt right intothe bar section due to the fact the NFL preseason game is on and it's not packed like the regular dining area. So we get greeted by our waiter, I ask him a simple question \" what's the difference between tri-tip and brisket?\" he replies confidently, \" tri tip is a leaner cut from the muscle in the back, and brisket is a shoulder cut, which has more fat. Both very good'\" he <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fadded.so&s=6fc9cef68d8d2c01bf1bec328b7c28134e2b355f9a6fa2223df6161c436860a3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">added.so</a> I go with the tri tip, my one friend gets the brisket and the other gets a steak. ...out comes the food.. Surprisingly mine looks like the brisket along with my buddies, but mine is cut differently. I ignore the appearance and dig in. I immediately notice the amount of fat throughout each cut. I think to myself \" did this fucker mess up my order?\" I ask my friends and they just think I'm talking out my ass but I know my cuts of meat and this shit ain't no tri-tip. So I ask a random Waiter what my dish looked like to him and he said tri-tip! WTF?? Hmmm that's weird! Now my friends really think I'm talking out my ass but I know I'm right, this is not what I ordered. I start thinking crazy thoughts like \"is this some Sort of tri-tip Conspiracy?\" I continue to eat what I did not order flabbergasted.. ..out come the check...the waiter begins passing out the checks since we had them separated. He passes the steak check to friend 1. Passes brisket check to friend 2. Now he passes mine without looking. I immediately open to see BRISKET. I experience mix emotions. I am pissed because I Knew he had fucked up And I'm happy Because I just confirmed I'm not crazy and I really Do know my cuts of meat! I notice my waiters name \"Tad\" and understood why he didn't tell us his name. I bring this conspiracy up to Tad and he stated \" I'm so sorry man do you wanna see my boss?\" I reply \"no thank you\". Overall I confirmed the staff at Lucile's do not know there cuts of meat and their bar service is really poor. Eat in the dining room and watch out for Tad bc he sucks.",

The first time I ate at this chain was in Anaheim and I was so excited to find out they had a  location near my home in Phoenix.  Their Baby Back Ribs are the best I've ever had - fall-off-the-bone smokey, sweet goodness - esp when you slather them with the sweet bbq sauce.  Get the full rack - even if you get it to go - because trust me, you're gonna want more after you have the first 1/2 rack.   The biscuits & cinnamon butter are delish as well.  More like a dessert than a starter - but very tasty.  Potato salad is very good (and I'm picky when it comes to potato salad)as are their drinks - back porch lemonade and watermelon iced tea are some of the drinks we've had here. I can't recall everything my dining partners ate but they enjoyed everything they ordered.  The servers are very attentive and friendly.  Always a pleasure to dine here.",

Even after telling them, they were quick to remedy it and bring us out a \"fresh\" batch... Which was also COLD! Lol..  My wife got the baby back ribs, and they were pretty tough, but the sauce was good. Her mashed potatoes and veggies were also COLD.  After them bringing out a \"fresh\" plate the second time and it being just as cold, we just decided to eat it, since we were pressed for time. For the price you pay, it is simply not worth it.  Not bad tasting, the service was great, the staff was friendly, and it was clean inside. But unless you like cold food, I would not recommend this place.",

I have never tasted any BBQ sauce like that come out of Memphis. It should really be labeled St. Louis style.  Also they have a pork sandwich  that you can get Memphis style with  mustard coleslaw and mustard sauce. Memphis has mayonnaise based coleslaw. I ordered the  pork queso that tasted freezer burned. I couldn't even finish the appetizer. For my entree I ordered the  BBQ chicken sandwich and Mac and cheese. The plate looked amazing however the chicken was not seasoned. It comes with a spring mix of lettuce that was giving off a bitter flavor so I removed that. The onion straws were soggy. The sandwich itself just didn't have any flavor once I removed the bitter lettuce. The Mac and cheese looked nice but also lacked salt and pepper. They overcharge for bad BBQ because Arizona doesn't know any better. I invite the owner to go to Memphis and reevaluate using Memphis name. I also invite ppl to try really Memphis BBQ in Memphis. I don't want all BBQ to taste like Memphis but I do expect it to taste decent.",

Well, let me state that Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que at Tempe Marketplace is anything BUT \"Succulent\", rather dried out meat that, per the manager on duty, \"Was smoked yesterday\", in other words, they served me \"OLD\" meat!  WHAT?  Yes, old meat.   In the beginning... They start off by serving biscuits, and my 1st order was, stated by the bartender was, \"they're old, so they may be hard.\" They were rocks. She asked me, \"would you like fresh biscuits?\"  Hum, let me think about that? YES!  The FRESH biscuits were mostly raw dough. I did notice they sprinkled large sugar granules on the top of the biscuits, not sure why, the sugar didn't help.   I ordered the BBQ Lunch Platter and opted for the beef rib (1 bone), brisket burnt ends, and tri-tips. The beef rib was OK at best. The tri-tips, going down hill. The brisket? I could have used it for building material. This LUNCH was $16.99! That's $16.99 out of my pocket for ^$#T!@#$%^!!!    I hope this was an oddity and it's not constantly bad... BUT...  That's your call. I will avoid Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que from now on.   NOTE: Their employees were cordial, and manager tried to make things \"right\" by substituting foods. He still charged me full price, which I paid without issue, as he did try. Service was fine. The food...not so much.",

The sugar biscuits were a definite plus. Unique and yummy. Portions were very generous. The spicy sausage that came with my appetizer ( three types of sausage came with the appetizer) was tasty and there was plenty to share with my 5 coworkers. Drinks were generous as well.  CONS: I prefer that my brisket has a  nice bark with a red ring around the edge. I also prefer my sausage casing to be firm and have a nice pop when I cut it. I had the sausage appetizer. The cheddar sausage ( one of the 3 sausages with the appetizer) tasted like something from the grocery store. Not bad but totally forgettable. The chips with the nachos seemed slightly over-fried. They have appetizer and drink specials during happy hour that you have to walk to the bar to get. This is ludicrous to me. I'm at you establishment, but you are going to charge me more money for the exact same items because I didn't get up and get them myself?!?  OVERALL: Decent service and decent food. I  would have no desire to go back. If you are familiar with Houston, TX I would compare this place to the Pappas BBQ chain.",

    "text": "Lucille's, I really wanted to like you! I looked at your menu and my mouth watered at all the Southern style favorites you served, such as jambalaya, pulled pork, po' boys, fried okra, and gumbo. However, while I did enjoy a few items here, my experience wasn't too great overall.  We came here on a weekend for a late dinner, and were seated promptly. There are various non alcoholic and alcoholic drinks to choose from, including a few varieties of iced tea and lemonade. I chose the watermelon iced tea ($2.99). It came served in a tall mason jar, with a large wedge of fresh watermelon in the drink. It was quite refreshing with great tea and watermelon flavor. Along with the drinks, we received a basket of sweet butter with light, buttery biscuits (Free, unlimited refills).  As for appetizers, we opted for the fried okra ($3.99 half portion). It was quite a large portion, with a light, crispy breaded outer layer. The okra itself tasted tender, with not a lot of the \"slimy\" texture okra can get. It was served with a spicy ranch and creole mustard sauce. Out of the two, I preferred the mustard better. It was made with whole mustard seeds and its flavor and consistency complimented the breaded, fried, okra better than the thinner, more one-dimensional flavor of the ranch.  I opted for the catfish po' boy sandwich ($11.99), and tried some of the pulled pork sandwich ($10.99). The catfish po' boy looked amazing! It was a huge portion of French bread with large, battered catfish nuggets, mayo with capers, tomatoes, and lettuce. However, the sandwich itself had some problems. The bread was really dry and tasted slightly old, and one of the catfish nuggets was still slightly raw. Setting that undercooked catfish nugget aside, I continued eating the rest of the sandwich, to find an unusual hard chunk while chewing. That hard chunk turned out to be a piece of fish bone stuck in one of the nuggets!   I had the braised greens as a side, which had a nice smokey flavor with very soft, tender greens from cooking \"low and slow.\" However, as I ate more, I got bits of grit while eating, meaning that they didn't rinse the greens enough before cooking them.  The pulled pork sandwich was better, but not particularly remarkable. I did enjoy the array of bbq sauces on the table to add to the sandwich though.  Prices for me, seem a bit high. They do have a nice looking happy hour and reverse happy hour at the bar every day, offering discounted drinks and appetizers which I might be tempted to try out some day. For now though, I'll be a bit hesitant to try more sandwiches and entrees from Lucille's.",

It is located in Tempe Market place but, has its own parking lot,which makes going here much easier than a lot of other places here. We sat on the back patio which was so nice. It is a nicely decorated place, Very Southern. It reminds me of a place in Florida or in the South. Well ,it was a lovely day outside,not too hot or cool so it was great for sitting outside.  We got fried green tomatoes for appetizer, which was really good and the first time I had ever had them. I had the BBQ chicken Salad, Sue got the breaded and fried cat fish with shrimp ,it also came with Sweet potatoes fries. She said it was fantastic, my other friend Alan got the fried Chicken and he is from Mississippi and it was very True to how they do it there. Bathrooms are nice and clean.Nice Hot water to wash off all the sticky BBQ. Staff is a little frazzled at times, there seems to be a bit of disorganization going on. 2 of us received our food and Sue waited quite a while to get hers as well. She did have the Strawberry Lemonade which she thought was Heaven.",

Ended up leaving money on table for our drinks and they never even came with our check. Waited ten minutes for someone to make things right. Hopefully next time they can have better service.",

Was a little disappointing.   The server we got out on the back patio was awesome though. Very attentive and able to customize our experience, since we had to leave quickly to catch a flight. Brought out boxes and check before we were done eating, without asking, once he knew we were in a rush. Thanks!   Food was pretty good, but depends widely on what you got. The brisket here is their thing, and it was definitely the highlight of the mains we got.  Salad wasn't anything spectacular.",

My husband ordered the Black Porch Strawberry Lemonade. A delicious combination!  The portions are huge and a fair price, so bring an appetite! Our waiter Jose, was very attentive and did a great job waiting patiently as we ordered and asked questions.  Save room for dessert, because the carrot cake feeds two and is scrumptious!",

The manager was super nice and agreed both were off. Then with my sandwich, I got mashed potatoes as a side. And I asked for gravy on the side vs. on top. I was surprised when I got the bill that there was a $2 charge for gravy. Mashed potatoes and gravy are traditionally served together, and our server never mentioned an upcharge. Overall, disappointing experience. I'm not sure how long I'll continue to be a customer if they don't make some improvements.",

    "text": "Without planning, Lucilles has ended up being a place we go to every time we are in town... Located right in Tempe Marketplace, it's a huge restaurant, we different themed dining areas. They are great for large groups.   Service here each time has been friendly. Our beverages (in HUGE mason jars) and food (huge portions), all brought to us within good time frames...   You get complimentary biscuits that come warm in a basket with their Apple butter, a good way to start!   Last night, I ordered one of their platters (chicken + 2 other meats + 2 sides). The chicken and brisket was tender, no knife needed. But the tri tip ends were just a bit tough in comparison, so I didn't eat much of that.... Corn was standard... I also got their peanut slaw, it was a greasy because of its oil/vinegar base. I wasn't a huge fan, but it's all in preference. Their cornbread with lots of honey and butter though, yummy! I tried a piece of their baby back ribs off my husband's plate, pretty good too... Everything was lathered in BBQ sauce. And like said earlier, huge portions, between hubby and I, we probably took home 5 lbs worth of leftovers!   So in conclusion, maybe not the highest quality BBQ, but this place is a fun spot to eat at. Food and ambience is good. You can also walk around after, which is what we have been doing...   I also have to mention the huge basket of tootsie pops at the take out counter in the front, cute!... And the fact that we were given warm wet hand towels after our meal.. Nice details!...  Ps, I see a lot of reviews complaining that this place is too expensive... I guess coming from out of town where this is the normal price range, I didn't really notice! And also, for the third time, portions of enormous!",

These two go above and beyond and never treated me or my family as a stereotyping server would. My family is diverse, but I am Native American. And each time we walk in the hosts (especially Renore?) are amazing as well as the service. The manager who checked on me and my friend at one visit was Jessica, very friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend this place, especially if you want great bbq. Note that you will spend money, but there are choices for family feasts. Also please tip the server, this restaurant bases it's service on team work, and almost anyone will get you what you need. Because of the teamwork atmosphere I always come back. As well as the great food.",

The timeliness of the food was very fast not like last time, our drinks were always filled. Great job to the back kitchen for the great food n timely delivery.

    "text": "I love your food. I consider myself a BBQ snob, and I am never disappointed in the quality of the BBQ at Lucilles. At my most recent visit, however, I was so disappointed in the service!  I placed a take out order of two racks of Saint Louis ribs.  Your server, Renora did a great job - verified my order, no problem. I got my order and drove home. Unfortunately, when I got home and unpacked the bag, what I had received was two racks of baby back ribs. The boxes were labeled \"baby back\" and when I opened the box, that is in fact what they were.  I called and talked to Renora, who was again super helpful. She apologized for the mix up, verified that I had paid for the Saint Louis ribs and connected me to the manager. This is where everything fell to pieces. The manager (a woman, I didn't get her name) was rude, tried to argue with me that I don't know the difference between baby backs and Saints, and would not even acknowledged that a mix up was even a possibility. I don't understand her horrible attitude. I wasn't asking for my money back - just the difference in what I paid versus what I got. She was so rude and dismissive, I felt horrible for even calling. She made me feel like my buisness doesn't matter.  I know it was a super busy day - the place was packed, but I don't think that is an excuse for her behavior. Perhaps by sharing my experience you could provide her with some customer service training. I think she could use it. **** I tried to send this feedback to the Lucille's website, but it does not work, so I am airing my disappointment on YELP instead.",

    "text": "wth?! why does Lucille's only have 3 stars?! this place is amazingly delicious and I'm glad I didn't read the yelp reviews before coming here.  So let's make this short... I got the tri-tip sandwich and mac and cheese since the waiter suggested both. It was amazing!!!! The meat was sooo good, and the sauces were delish. I have never had mac and cheese that delicious in my life. Also, I don't know why people are saying the prices are high.. it seemed pretty standard for a sit down restaurant.   Anyways, I'm 8 months pregnant and since Lucille's, bbq has become my new obsession!! I've never had bbq from the south or anything, but I've tried a couple other bbq places around the area and I have yet to find a place as good as Lucille's.",

On Friday August 3rd 2012 I was there for a retirement party for a co worker of 31 years and we were wanting to celebrate! I called in earlier and spoke with C.... and asked if it was possible to get the happy hour prices. He had asked his manger and was given the OK to give us the happy hour prices to our group. We are seated and I see the waitress and tell her that C.... said we get the happy hour pricing and she said great. C.... found me and said he was unable to honor the happy hour pricing that he thought I was from another group of forty. I said how was that possible when I gave you all of the information of our group. He said he was sorry that he could only honor 1 drink per person from the happy hour menu. By that time all of us where aware of what I was told earlier. I was a waitress and have worked in the restaurant field for years and never ever would I have told forty people they would not honor a request that had already been approved by a manager earlier. Needles to say My family & I did not order one thing from this place and never will. They lost over $150.00 just by my family. The people that did order received the wrong food and the food tasted awful. For the prices they charge I think they should be able to hire people that can take care of you just a bit better then we were. I go to restaurants that on person can handle a table of 40 and get all the food and drink orders correct not two or three people and get most the orders incorrect.   I will take my hard earned money where it is appreciated!  Renee' S.",

Which is great when I want to sleep at my desk that afternoon. Like most BBQ joints, Lucille's gives you huge portions. Unfortunately, it's not good enough that i want a portion that big.  The other day the co-workers and I went there for lunch. I hadn't been in a while so I was looking forward to trying it again. We walked in and were told there would be a wait even though most of the tables were open. Weird. But the bar is open seating so we just grabbed a table there.   We started with an order of sweet potato fries for the table. They were actually really good. I do like their sides a lot. So I enjoyed stuffing my face with some sweet potato goodness.  For my entree I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich with watermelon. My sandwich was just luke warm and something about the sauce tasted funky. I've liked it in the past but there was something a little off  this time. Luckily I had filled up on fries so I just kinda picked at the chicken.   Oh, the sugary biscuits you get with your meal are good too. So really, all the sides are good and the BBQ is just okay. Maybe they should have an option of a side sampler as your meal.  Overall, it's good not great. Good for a lunch where someone else is paying, that is.",

When they brought it to the table, I could tell it was not going to be great. The gravy was extremely thick, like custard. I put a spoonful on top of my turkey, and it sat there in a lump on top of it. I tried to spread it around on top, and gave up.  The turkey was room temperature, on top of a slice of plain white bread and a large pile of stuffing. It looked like it was all dried out, and I could hardly swallow it. The potatoes had a lot of garlic in them, and that didn't go very well with the stuffing. I asked if I could try a different gravy. They brought a brown gravy, and it had some kind of herb in it. It tasted terrible to me.  I have a rule that I only order what the restaurant is famous for. I should have ordered BBQ.",

    "text": "This place was pretty decent, but I wouldn't include it in my list of favorite barbecue joints.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and mac and cheese, both recommended by the server. The sandwich was unsauced, which gave me a chance to try the three sauces on the table. I wasn't a fan of the Memphis-style sauce, so I split the meat between the original and spicy sauces, both of which were good, but nothing special.  The meat was pretty good, but nothing I haven't had before. The mac and cheese was pretty cheesy, but if that's what they're calling their best side, then they need to give it a little more umph, maybe some bread crumbs, bacon, or something other than just plain macaroni with melted cheese on top.  For dessert I went with the Snickers pie, as recommended. I'd probably recommend this to be split among two people - this was a lot of ice cream. It was good and nicely presented, but I don't think I'd get that much again.  Overall, this was a reasonably good experience, but I don't know if it's worth the trip or the money.",

It was like we weren't even there at all. We ordered drinks and it was like automatic confusion. The server who we ordered them from left and never brought them but 10 minutes later someone else asked us if we wanted drinks so we reordered and they came in another 5 minutes. Then after awhile, another person took our order and I ordered a salad 1st and specifically asked for it 1st and it never came. When our meals came, I told the 4th person we spoke to to cancel my salad. My friend ordered the corn and asked for extra butter for it. It never came so we stopped a server (#5) and asked for melted butter. He said \"no problem\"! But....never returned. We flagged down a female manager who apologized and went to get it. By the time my friend got butter, the corn was cold. We were there for approximately 1hr and 30 min and I got burnt ends and iced t and my friend got a tri tip sandwich and an iced t. Simply ridiculous. Never was asked about appetizers, never asked if we wanted dessert and never were we checked on during the meal. It's a good thing there are so many restaurants within a 5  miles radius because I certainly don't need to spend my hard earned money here.",

So, we sat in the bar at a high top table. One of the main things we like about Lucille's is the funky/retro decor. It is really cool. We would love to have a room like the one with the rattan furniture- my grand aunt DID have one like it with a canary too!   I got a Joe's hurricane, it was good. Our waiter, who was also the bartender brought us biscuits. The are good, but not great. They are served with a cinnamon butter, no honey or plain butter, but you can probably ask for some. We ordered a side of veggies which were wonderful! They were green beans, red bell pepper, onion, etc cooked to perfection in a nice butter sauce. They were not rubbery or too crisp, not mushy either, just right! We also got sweet potato fries which came with a garlic mayo, I am not a fan of mayo so opted for the ranch dressing on some or just plain- I like them that way.  The 2 items we got were good, but I am not a fan of their BBQ sauces so would not go there for BBQ.",

    "text": "Mind-boggling rhetorical question of the day: Who on earth chooses to have their bachlorette party dinner at Lucille's?   My down home girlie girl, who, bless her sweet heart and wonderbread palate, absolutely adores this joint.   To start, the service was absolutely atrocious. Party of eight on a Friday night. Annoying? I can see how it could be. More annoying? Losing the reservation and shoving us into a corner designed to seat five, maybe six max. A bunch of elbow bumping, scantily clad chicks all dolled, sipping fruity ass hurricanes and the like. Probably pretty humorous to observe. Not so humorous to navigate.  Put on your woo-girl face though because this is a par-tay! Woo!  Bring out the mildly scandalous goodie bags filled with penis lollipops, dirty fortune cookies and flavored lube (i.e. the tame stuff). Just scandalous enough send your Great Aunt Esther into a conniption fit. Seriously, if this was the genuine highlight of this meal, it really does not speak highly of the hot garbage being slopped on a plate at Lucille's. Woo!  And we wait, and wait, and wait.   Bread, finally! Woo!  Wait, are you sure you didn't confuse biscuits with hard tack? Because not even the scrumptious honey butter you've got is worth the dental bills incurred from teething this rock.   Again we wait, and wait, and wait.   Pulled pork! Woo!  Hold up. How does a pulled pork sandwich manage to be incredibly greasy and dry as a bone at the same time? Have I slipped into some alternative dimension? Is it opposite day? Because if so, this shit is finger-lickin' good. You best slop on that BBQ sauce to add some semblance of flavor to the sandwich and hope it doesn't soak through the bun in 2.5 seconds flat. Worst pulled pork sandwich I have ever eaten. Hands down. The garlicky mashed potatoes as a side were the only saving grace of the meal.  I seriously have no idea how this place stays in business. If it were not for the over abundance of low swingin' crotch fruit I brought to the party, dinner here would have tanked, hard and fast. It was awkward, drawn out (3 hours!) and ridiculously expensive. The best part about the experience was walking out the door. Woo!",

Walking into here was not really what i expected looking at it from the outside as i notice these patio tables with older table clothes (don't quote me on that). My first impression was amazing the stuff was super busy and they where still able to say hello as we walk in. My first impression was comforting and as i sat down waiting for our server the smell of a smoker came to us and to notice there is really look like there is a smoker right behind us which i would have never have seen if it wasn't for the smell.  Now 30min have passed and no server. I really should have gave this 3 stars but once are sever came it change.  Server- Simone was our sever and me and my wife can say she turn it all around. Not looking tired or stress she greeted us with a smile.  She was very honest and recommended dishes that we will like. Fast with drinks and also recommended beer right off the bat. Thanks for selling me on the 5 beers i had. Overall Simone was what made our and made this 5 stars  Food- Per Simone she recommended we get the bbq two meat combo which was amazing. Came with two side dishes and two meats, the beef ribs and tri tip where to die for. The mac and cheeses was amazing and the sweet corn was the best the we ended up buying two more side dishes. If any of you do decided to come here get the two meat combo it will fill you guys both up  Next time I'm down here hope Simone is here and will sure be back with groups of friend.   Ask for Simone best sever i have ever had.",

I understand why people are lamenting about how stupid the prices are, but come on, y'all. You could totally share a meal with someone here and leave satisfied (as long as you eat yer biscuits.) Now, now, I know what you're thinking, \"We don't take kindly to sharers 'round these parts...\" But put down your pitchforks, because the portions are proportionally reasonable to their stupid prices.  Lucille's lands at 2 stars for good biscuit and cornbread game, solid tri-tip and peanut slaw, and subpar brisket and mac 'n' cheese.

It was blackened with Cajun seasoning completely over seasoned and it was cold. I believe mine sat out while they remade my boyfriends since his was the one that was dropped and had to be remade. The service was nice but the food isn't worth the wait.",

I like the decor of the place, old, southern junkyard is what I call it for lack of a better term. Hubcaps, signs, chain link like fences separating the rooms. They have EXCELLENT beef ribs! Add their great potato salad to that and you just may experience the big O while you are there lol",

It was enough food for 3 adults, a baby and leftovers for lunch the next day. It is quite possibly the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. The only thing i wouldn't suggest was the fries. Shoestring fries don't do it for me. Service was friendly and the ambience was charming. I'd definitely go back!",

Had time to look at the menu before she got there and was a bit shocked at the prices. Half a rack of ribs at $25. They were good but not all that. The greens were tasty, the mashed potatoes dry. I did like the cornbread a lot. My friend raved about the cheese grits. I like them too. Our appetizer took forever. Found out they went to the wrong table before our waitress ever bothered to figure that out when we asked twice if it was still coming. Good customer service because the manager brought a fresh sausage Trio appetizer and comped it. I'd be willing to try this place again but it's not on the top of my list",

    "text": "BBQ has to be one of my favorite foods and when a co worker suggested this place I was all for it.  Living on the west side it was quite the drive but being that I am a BBQ fanatic I had to see what this was all about.    First off Lucille's has a good location.  Its located by Dave and Buster in the Tempe Marketplace.  The look of the place is gimmicky but in a Famous Dave's kinda way.  They have old school signs, mason jars to drink out of, and all the little fake things to make you seem like you have gone to Memphis or where ever they are trying to transport you.  The service was absolutely awful.  It took way to long to get drinks and even longer to get refills.  Attitude the whole time.  Here is a tip if you want a good tip bust your butt.  Then you will have more money to pay for your tuition (half the staff is college kids).  And do not roll your eyes when I don't want to try your suggestions.  They tell you they smoke all their meats in house im not impressed.    Now onto the most important part the BBQ.  We had the brisket,half chicken and rib tips with a side of greens and sweet potato fries.   The chicken was good.  It had a smoke on it and was tender not real complaints.  The portion size was good.  Brisket was dry and you couldn't cut it with a fork.  That tough.  Maybe over smoked?  Portion size tiny.  4 strips maybe 3 or 4 inches long.  Rib Tips were dry and covered in sauce.  Hardly any meat on them.  Most places in the valley load you up on Rib Tips when you order they are a cheap meat.  But not this place.  You get a scoop full.  Boo.  Collard greens were disgusting.  Cooked in some weird pork parts and they were bitter.  Greens are not supposed to be bitter if cooked right!  Sweet Potato Fries.  You can't really mess these up they probably came frozen.  So I would recommend these over regular fries.  The starter of a biscuit with sugar on top was just weird.  WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD.  And the biscuit wasn't even warm enough to melt the sugar I mean apple butter.   One last thing the house and spicy BBQ sauce's main ingredients are CORN SYRUP thats how they thicken it! seriously that should tell you something.  Overall two thumbs down.  Stay away there are plenty of other great BBQ spots in the valley.",

I've eaten here so many times and had nothin but rave reviews; that was before I became a Yelper. :)  Server must have been having a bad night because she set the whole time which was basically not good. I want to say how good the food was (appetizer was the fried shrimp and I love it every time) but I don't want to take focus away from how bad the service was. Dang it! I was going I take a picture of the stack of appetizer, salad, and side plates at the end of our table cause they were there for sinking and when I finally decided to whip out the camera she cleared them. Must have seen me typing. Lol. Refills were non existent, server forgot Jen's beer she ordered after being seated and finally brought it after my second refill on soda and after Jen asked for a different beer. She was apologetic and I'm the last person to be mean or belittle a server unless they are outright rude. Our server wasn't rude; just having a bad night i guess. The table next to is were being jerks so maybe it's all their fault. Lol  Our food came and I ate so now I can talk about the food. Aaaaarrgh! No that wasn't a pirate roar. It was the sound of frustration. I really do love this place. And I was sooooo determined tom order something different than the New Orleans chicken which I can't seem to tear myself away from. Tonight, I was a pioneer; a trend setter; Capt. Kirk. In orders their marinated steak cooked mid rare. Mmmmmmm. Well ironworks have been of it wasn't over cooked and completely bland and flavorless. If that hunk of meat had been marinated for 24 hours like the menu states, it must have been in a bucket of water.  Booooo. See what happens when you try new things!  Jen order ribs and some \"burnt ends\" bbq'd meat combo. They were good. That's all I can say. I didn't even ask for a box for mine.   Also, I'm all for a nice AC environment during the AZ summer but holy smokes, I couldn't find a knife so I cut my steak with my nipples. Good thing I wore long sleeves or I would have had I amputate due to frostbite.   Ok so in closing. Jen is quoted as saying, \"I loved my food.\" Everything else sucked. I have never had a bad experience here before I'm over a half dozen visits in the last couple years. That makes this so much harder because I think my feelings got hurt. I have bragged about this place to so many I should be getting kick backs. Don't these people know who I am. Geesh!  Lol. I'm sure I will be back but I won't be so eager to do so anytime soon.  I'm sad now. :(  P.S.  Quit taking my silverware and leaving me nothing to eat with. Also, the Mac and cheese was bland and was really bad.  There is virtually no cell service and absolutely no wi-fi. So frustrating. Ok I'm done.",

First off it was 11 AM and the place had just opened and yet they parked us in a booth by the kitchen. Before we could even strap our baby into the high chair and sit down the waitress was hovering over us wanting to get our drink orders. Now some might take this as a sign of fast customer service, but that was it...totally rushed and overwhelmed. Not very Southern or hospitable. She gets our drink orders and brings my 5 year old back a huge open mason jar for a drink instead of a kids cup. Meanwhile she had stinky attitude the whole time. We open the overwhelmingly large menus and my eyes almost pop out of my head at the prices. So we order our overpriced plates and no sooner then we get them she's dropping off the dessert menu. Mind you...there are few patrons as it is still quite early. So we don't finish our food because of the large portions which makes me feel better about the pricing so I'm boxing up my food and my toddler accidentally knocks my catfish on the floor. My husband and I are scrambling to pick it up and the waitress just stands there looking at us. Doesn't offer to help, doesn't ask if I want to replace it. Just too busy trying to cash us out. I've never felt so robbed in my life. Take your $80 to the grocery store and feed your family for a week before taking them to this sham of a family establishment.",

    "text": "Last visited 4/27/12...  I have been here several times so I am surprised that I have not written a review yet.  Each time I have been here, the food has been very good.  I have tried a range of BBQ dishes including the Baby Backs, Tri-Tip, Brisket and Pulled Pork.  Each meat has been great.  Many sides to choose from.  Baked Beans, sweat potato mashed, regular and garlic mashed, etc.  The Mac and Cheese is probably not their best dish.  Biscuits are good as is the corn bread.  I also enjoy the Fried Green Tomatoes as an appetizer.   Service is usually very good and attentive.  This last visit, I was a little disappointed about the ability to keep drinks full. It seems anywhere I have been going lately wait staff has a very hard time paying attention to drinks.  This to me is a huge service error and likely to always cost a restaurant an extra star.   I have also had desserts there although not this last time, Too Full!!    It is a great location.  Parking is always available although on weekends you may have to walk from back lot a little as this location shares with Dave and Busters and Cadillac Ranch.  Overall, a very good dinner on Friday night!!",

We had the Saint Louis ribs and fried pickles for an appetizer. Both were delicious!! The only complaint is that the wait seemed a little long with several open tables and once we were seated it took a little while before the waiter came to us. The Southern hospitality however was on point and the staff couldn't be friendlier. They accommodated moving us when we got cold inside with ease. Overall, I was very impressed and will definitely be back, I will just make sure I have time to spare and am ready to relax with some great food.",

With that being said, I heard some good things about the place so decided to check it out.    I will say, the service is touch and go, whether it's packed or not.  The food, while a bit on the pricey side for what it is, is pretty damn good.  The portions are HUGE.  The BBQ sandwich was about the best I've had west of the Mississippi. It was as close to an Eastern Carolina BBQ as any place has come, which is saying a lot.  They do BBQ right.  My bf ordered chicken and biscuits and was also impressed.    Overall, pretty good.  The A-ok rating is the prices are a bit steep for the type of food, the service has never been very good and the place could be a bit less \"gimmicky\" and a bit more traditional.  Other than that, worth it for some good old comfort food.",

We waited for approximately 20 minutes which wasn't bad.  Restaurant was fairly crowded but we sat in an area outside of the bar which was very comfortable.    Service was just ok, seemed like she took a long time to initially greet us and then to refill drinks.  Our party of three ordered fried green tomatoes as an appetizer and for dinner - tri-tip sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, chicken dinner.  Sides included corn bread and sweet potato fries. My husband felt that the corn bread was some of the best he's ever had.  All in all, our food deserved 5 stars.  When visiting Phoenix again, we would definitely return.",

The restaurant itself is located in a busy mall so finding parking can get a bit hectic but besides that the place is huge. We have never had to make a reservation even with a big party. Once you get seated and get your drinks they bring these amazing honey biscuits to die for. The menu selection is huge. Almost to hard to settle with one dish so we usually stick with the most popular item, of course the Ribs. The ribs are fab. You also get to pick your own side dish like Mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, string fries or beans. No matter what you pick its going to be good. The cocktails are good and service always fast. The part that my husband likes the most is their prices. Ver very reasonably priced. We have never left room for desert so I wouldn't know but I'm sure big portions as well.",

    "text": "This place is very much a chain.  Corny decor, unimaginative menu, bland food, servers devoid of personality.  Still, the booths in the bar are comfy and so we had a good time dining here with friends a month or so ago and watching a playoff game.  They try very hard not to be nailed down to a particular style of barbeque.  Of course this means that they don't do anything particularly well but it also means that you could take a big group of people here from all different parts of the country and they would each be able to find something they wanted to eat on the menu (isn't that the reason for having chain restaurants in the first place?).  A lot of the dishes were served dry and then you could add your own sauce - they had 3 different bottles on the table.  And this is one of the few places we have found in Phoenix that serves Texas style beef ribs so that is a big plus.  We also tried the fried green tomatoes and the okra for appetizers.  Neither was very good (seriously, stay away from the tomatoes) but I haven't had either of them since we lived in the south so even a lousy version of the dish is better than nothing.  What was really amusing is how the server obviously had never had good BBQ in her life; you could really tell by the way she described the dishes.  Anyone who can't answer how long something was smoked and whether it was seasoned with a dry rub or a mop does not deserve to be working at a BBQ joint; even if they are only 16, that is no excuse.  Oh wait, this isn't a BBQ pit, it's a chain imitation.  Sorry, I forgot for a minute.  Overall, the food and service probably should have been one or two stars if I compare it to other barbeque restaurants I have eaten at nationally but compared to what I have had in Phoenix it is a solid three, sadly.  Another thing that gave them an a-ok was the fact that they had a really good selection of beers on tap and even offered Micheladas.  I never thought that drink would go with BBQ but it was a pretty good pairing with the spicy Texas-style sauce they offered.  Too bad they couldn't even do this right; though they did have some Mexican beers on tap the ratio was off (it was like half mixer at least) and they charged $7.50 a pop for them.  I also thought it was cute how the waitress mispronounced the name of the drink and then corrected me when I pronounced it right.  Just priceless.",

After being told it would be 20 minutes, our party decided to head over to Lucille's (which didn't have a wait at all) after about 40 minutes. We were seated immediately. The wait staff was really nice and very prompt with taking our orders. The kitchen was moving pretty fast as well for a table of 10...had our food in about 15 minutes after ordering.   We got the deviled eggs as an appetizer and they were alright. I would have expected a little more seasoning and flavor based on the description on the menu. For my main course, I had the fried catfish and shrimp with coleslaw and greens. The catfish and shrimp were pretty good, the coleslaw was super good, but the greens were disappointing. My grandparents on both sides of my family were farmers so I have eaten a lot of good \"country\" food. Definitely had more than my fair share of fresh greens and those tasted like Glory greens from a can. I wasn't a fan. I also ordered the peach tea and wasn't able to drink it as it was too sweet, even after diluting with water. It did however come in a large mason jar which I loved.",

I asked for a bun for the pull pork to make a sandwich and they even toasted the bun for me. I got 2 sides the Mac and cheese and fries.

I had to approach the host a few times before we were seated and he was VERY dismissive. Our waitress was nice but by the time we ordered and got our food 30 minutes had gone by. I understand that Lucille's is a sit down restaurant and not fast food, but what I don't understand is if you are promoting a lunch menu, you would have to promote it to the standard working person who doesn't have two hours to waist just sitting around. So yes, the argument can be that the food is good and it takes time to make. Well, let me squash that right here too. The waitress accidentally put in for pulled pork instead of baby back ribs so when we brought that to her attention it took FOUR minutes for her to scrape the pulled pork from the plate and bring out the ribs. So why did it take 30 minutes to serve the table. We ended up having to leave before we could even finish because we have jobs we need to get back to and we're already there for an hour and a half.   2 stars because the food is good but the service was below standard.",

We happened to park near Lucille's and when we walked by heading toward the shops, the smell of BBQ tempted us to go look at the menu. We weren't ready to eat just then, but decided that after a little shopping, we'd stop in for a late lunch/early dinner.  The biscuits and apple butter they offered to start were delicious.  The biscuits were heavenly - soft and warm, and not dry as they so often can be.  For entrees, I had the beef brisket with a baked potato and mac & cheese.  The brisket was amazing - moist, flavorful and practically melting in my mouth.  Baked potato came with butter, sour cream and green onions.  The mac & cheese was creamy and mild - not overpowering with flavor.  Hubby had the fried chicken with garlic mashed and vegetable medley.  He never did offer me a bite of his chicken, but said it was moist and delicious and he was disappointed that he wasn't able to finish it all.  Portion sizes were very generous.  We didn't try any desserts because we were just too full.  Prices were a little on the higher end of our budget, but nothing too outrageous.  I reallyneed enjoyed the look of the restaurant too.  It did have that southern charm and reminded me of some of the places we'd visited on our trip to Georgia and South Carolina.  Lucille's makes the list of places we'll go again.",

    "text": "Been here at least a dozen times over the years and the last 2 or 3 have been a let down. Never anything big, but little things that annoy you to the point of now, I'll probably not go back. We used to literally LOVE this place My entire family does, so we always went here with the family for outings as they are good for groups, take reservations, and are delicious.  The things that annoy me, more than a little bit, are how they \"nickel & dime\" you with prices. The drinks are all about .50-$1 higher than most places. Nothing huge, but a little small price poke. Not the money, more the principle as it's kind of a \"hidden\" fee in my opinion, unless you want to order water I guess. When you are taking out your family, that's an extra $2-$4 right on the top, or in the case of us, over $10 with a large group. My first \"bone to pick\" is their lemonade. They ALWAYS offer it when taking the drink order, \"Can I get you an iced tea, or maybe a lemonade or strawberry lemonade?\". Sounds good of course, and my kids ALWAYS want the lemonade. And I ALWAYS forget that it's the price of an alcoholic drink, not a normal, although high already, beverage price like soda or tea. And you guessed it, they NEVER tell you this when they offer it and you order it. I have been surprised by this charge for the last time and will not be going back.   To be fair, the service here has always been good and the food good as well. But in addition to the drink prices they raised several of their other dishes price as well. I noticed this but even my in-laws mentioned it as well which made my decision easier. They have always gouged on drinks, and always been a little more expensive than similar places like Texas Roadhouse, but now that they raised the prices they have priced themselves out of the market for me.  I don't do this to smear them, just my opinion. They aren't any better than those types of places and those places don't have the BS \"hidden\" fees that get me every time.  Anyways, thanks for reading, maybe they'll read this too.",

Chicken was nicely shredded, i wouldnt have minded a few more shrimp.  Also got the rib tips. They were good. So glad i got the half order, because it was a decent portion. Finally, the fried green tomatoes. So disappointing. They had a nice coating and crunch but were just bland. No cayenne, paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder, nothing. And the red pepper sauce for dipping, tasted like plain heavy creamer. Banana pudding was what it is. Oh and we only got one biscuit with no butter:(",

Only gave 4 stars bc my brisket wasn't as tender as I would've liked but overall everything on my plate was delicious. Great place with fun southern decor! Bar inside was nice as well.",

    "text": "Came here with a group of friends. Was my first time! We shared the wings and fried pickles as an appetizer together. The fried pickles were huge! They used spear pickles. Which was a first for me because I'm used to seeing pickle chips haha. Their wings were extremely good. Huge portion for just an appetizer too! They were nice and juicy, the sauce has so much flavor.  Even the main dishes were huge! The portions are so huge here, you can easily share 1 dish with 2 or 3 people. Which is what one of my friends and I decided to do. We ordered the BBQ chicken & 2 meats (burnt ends & rib tips). For our sides, we got Mac & chz & cole slaw. The chicken was so juicy & fall off the bone tender. The burnt ends and rip tips really hit the spot for me. Again, really tender! Plus they have a few different in house BBQ sauces to choose from which made it even better! Their Mac & chz & Cole slaw were very good as well.  The reason I gave this place 3 stars was because service was almost horrible. We got here at 730pm for dinner. We all were starving since we haven't eaten since noon that day. The restaurant was about 30% full the whole time we were there. Our server didn't pay much attention to our table. We sat down and it took him 10 mins just to order our drinks and about another almost 15 mins to bring us our drinks and take our order. Never came to give us refills. And never checked on us after our food arrived and took a day and a half to bring the checks.",

    "text": "This Lucilles is one of our favorite places. By favorite I mean we come here every single weekend. We're  both huge gym goers and eat here as our cheat meal. Let me tell you, it's an epic cheat meal. We've mastered our order by now so I'll break it down for you. I'm vegetarian (I know a vegetarian loving a bbq place but bear with me) so I get the garden burger. I replace the grilled onions with  the onion straws and get a side of ranch and sweet potato fries. The burger is perfect this way. It's not meant to taste like meant fyi. The sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had. A lot of times, sweet potato fries can get soggy and that has never happened here. It's a delicate balance between soggy and crispy. These nail it.   My fiance gets the roasted half chicken with a side of macaroni and a baked potato. The baked potato is always perfectly cooked, never dry. The chicken is juicy and super savory. It has a smoked flavor that is incomparable to anything else. Smoked meat is one of their specialties and it shows. The mac and cheese has a fresh layer of cheese on top. It's incredibly rich and creamy. We like to dip it in ranch, no surprise there. Their house sauce is delish too!   Oh! I almost forgot the biscuits! They give you complimentary biscuits. They are warm, crumbly and dusted with sugar. They give you a side of cinnamon butter. We also get a honey with the biscuits. It's a hassle sometimes to get but it's a necessity. Seriously you need the honey. Please trust me on this.   As for the service, with the description I just gave.... who cares. But in all seriousness, the service is good. Not great but good. They get really busy and sometimes they forget our excessive ranch or our honey. They operate as a team so you can grab anyone in black. Funny enough, the first time we didn't like the food but we gave it another shot and fell in love.   Oh and a live band on saturday. Sooooo get your butt to Lucilles and get yourself a food baby.",

    "text": "I love Lucille's and frequented their multiple locations back in California.  My first visit to their Arizona location occurred last night and it was awful.  The primary issue was related to our incompetent server, Lamont.  After being seated by the host, our server did not great us until 5 minutes had passed.  Finally Lamont greeted us and apologized for being late to stop by and we would soon learn that this was about the theme of the entire night.  We placed a drink order, which included a draft beer and a cocktail.  Unfortunately 10 minutes passed before Lamont returned with our drinks.  Keep in mind that the store appeared to have steady business but was not overly busy especially given that it was a Monday night.  When Lamont dropped our drinks we ordered right away fearing that not doing so would result in another disappearing act by our server.  We ordered a Backyard Feast for 2 which comes with a salad or appetizer selection, chicken, meats, 2 sides, and desert.  We ordered salads to start and were asked if we wanted their biscuits as well.  Of course the biscuits are great here.  We waited a full 15 minutes before Lamont showed up with our salads and no biscuits.  Again he apologizes with a smirk which we learn is his way of dismissing the situation.  At this point we were concerned that the main course would arrive without having the chance to finish the salads.  As predicted, we were maybe 3 bites in when our food arrived from the food runner.  Now we're feeling annoyed, rushed and regretting our decision to stop in.  Lamont after some additional time decides to stop by to check on us and apologizes again which is just infuriating us further.  We also had to ask him for the biscuits which he acknowledged with an annoyed lisp.  In the end we ended wasting 2 hours of our life on the worst serving experience we've had in a long time.  Very sad because we like Lucille's and drove 45 minutes to this location.",

Tender meat with a nice light smoky flavor and the sauce - served on side was slightly sweet and vinegar... I loved it. The potato salad was ok.

I ordered the brisket with cole slaw and when it came out it looked like cardboard. I poked at it and it was hard. It's pathetic to have a restaurant name BBQ if they can't even perfect brisket. I told the guy to take it bad and I ordered wings instead...the wings aren't good... I should of ordered salad.. you can't screw that up.   This place is like a Olive Garden, Chili's, Red Lobster for BBQ. Real nasty food. Nothing special about it at all. If you never had BBQ you probably wouldn't mind, but if you are like me who will travel 3 hours or more to eat BBQ don't bother going here. GO TO LITTLE MISS BBQ!!!!",

    "text": "My friends and are scattered all over town, and Tempe Market Place seems to be the central location for us all to meet. For whatever reason we always end up at Lucille's and we don't know why.   The drinks are large, and tasty. The raspberry lemonade has been ruind for us, since a little kid at the booth next to us drank about 5 of them, and threw up on our feet. (The poor restaurant had to re-seat half the section! This kids parents just patted his back, instead of running him to the bathroom... what the heck?!) I was really hoping an old 10% managers discount for that - but nothing.   The food isn't the worst... but it certainly isn't the best, or the cheapest. I do like the pulled pork, but fast food Dickies does a better pulled pork.   The bar decor, is very New Orleans, and feels very... I don't know... unsettling to me. I can't put my finger on it.   Sadly, as indifferent as I am to this place - I am sure we will end up back here, because we ALWAYS end up here.   One of us needs to speak up, because I can't be the only one that isn't wild about this place.",

Portions are all out of whack also. Good sized portion for the fried pickles (5/5, those are amazing), small portion for fried tomatoes (1/5, very bland). BBQ overall was very, very plain and bland. And the \"hot\" bbq sauce has zero heat to it.  I guess its ok for a BBQ joint in AZ. I won't be back.   PS - not a bbq aficionado,  but i know good food,  this isn't it,  look for another place for your bbq",

PS, on 12/26 I came back to the restaurant again, and again ordered a blackened catfish.I asked for cocktail sauce and was told they didn't have any. When I asked if they could make it, the server was kind enough to ask a manager who not only did she make it but also delivered it. Kudos to Sara the manager for her great customer service skills!",

And it even comes in this glass drinking jar that makes drinking tea so much more fun and refreshing.  Lucille has become a definite stop when family and friends are in town.

    "text": "We had heard of the Lucille's in Vegas.  They raved about it, so we decided to give it a try at Tempe Marketplace.  We drove 30 minutes down from North Phoenix.  Found the ambiance to be 'cluttered', but probably one of this chains trademarks.  You could tell that some light shades had probably been broken and they had been substituted for something else.  Carpet was clean, our booth was clean and comfortable.  We were seated right away, but had to wait to get someone to take our drink order, which wasn't our server.  What they did was go into the kitchen to tell the server assigned to our table they had a table.  That's when our server came out and we gave our drink order a second time.  After we got our drinks, the server said that they would be right back with the biscuits which was the quickest thing done re: the whole dining experience.  We gave our dinner order when the biscuits were brought out.  For an appetizer, we ordered the onion strings, which were basic onion strings.    My dinner partner ordered the Beef Tip sandwich w/ mashed potatoes as their side.  The sandwich was lukewarm.  The mashed potatoes were cold.  We kept the sandwich as is, but had new potatoes brought out - these were hot.  Obvious that the food had been sitting on the rack waiting to be served.  My dinner partner made the comment that the sandwich would have been good if it have been hot.  I ordered the Cajun Chicken sandwich with the peanut coleslaw.  My sandwich was hot.  Problem was that chicken was cooked so that it was tough.  Tough to take a bite, tough to chew and tough to cut with the steak knife.  Made we wonder about the quality of the meat.  Through out the evening we had 4 different servers taking care of us.  Have no idea what our server was doing.  We hardly saw them out on the floor.  When they were, they at least came by 3 times to see how we were doing.  Take note, they were not the one who brought out the appetizer or the food.  We also watched as other parties came, got seated and were getting their food before we did.  Our server didn't even bring out the check, a whole other server who was trying to get their food served to their table had to drop it off.  The food was nothing special and over priced.  Definitely have had better for less.  Can't really rate our server on their service since we had so many different people coming by the table.  Were they nice and pleasant - Yes.  Did they try to fix the problem - yes.  The problem was something that shouldn't have happened in the first place.  The overall experience wasn't all that great from the very beginning.  As we watched the other tables we took note that the other tables did not have the entire 'team' thing going on.  Those servers took care of their tables and were attentive to their customers.  We will not be returning.  For the money and overall experience and 30 minute drive, not worth the trip to Tempe.",

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich that was smoked to perfection and it was very filling, my fiance ordered the rib tip sandwich that was equally as great! We had the onion straws as an appetizer and the half portion was more than enough for the both of us! They came out hot and delicious with their sauce that's to die for!

We ordered about 8 different items off the menu, the fried tomatoes and okra were okay, but lets be honest, they were fried and its pretty hard to mess fried food up. Then I ordered the pulled pork and the meat was extremely dry I also got 3 sides because I was so excited to try everything (braised greens, mac n cheese, and bbq beans). The bbq beans was the only thing that was okay. The service was really good, though I don't go out to restaurants for the staff.

Vodka, triple sec, strawberry lemonade & a splash of soda (I'm guessing Sprite). The first sip packed a little punch, but after that every drink tasted better than the last! I like that :D   For appetizers our group ordered Fried Green Tomatoes & Fried Pickles to share, both were yummy!    As a main dish I got a small plate of Gumbo with Cornbread. The cornbread had a cake texture, not my fav. The gumbo was good, nice texture, perfect amount and combination of meats (sausage, chicken, shrimp), but it was a bit on the salty side. It seems that to even out the saltiness they used pepper. I smelled it before I tasted, so it was quite a bit of pepper. I've pretty much spent the rest of the day trying to hydrate, lol! But it did clear my sinuses right up! I think I'll try something different next time :)  The service was good, the location was nice (we sat out on the lovely Southern style porch) & at lunch time (12:30 pm) we didn't have to wait to be seated.",

Besides the usual steak, smoked chicken, and burgers, they've got curly onion straws, a fantastic southern seafood section, fried chicken, jambalaya, and a great brisket sandwich. The iced tea and strawberry limeade are pretty great, too.  Setting is nice, and I do like the service. Friendly people, even on crowded peak times. One time, I was asking a server his opinion between two items on the menu. He leaned in to explain that, while management doesn't allow him to bash on anything, he really wouldn't recommend the (i forgot) here. That's the kind of genuine catering to customers that I love, and the kind of behavior that would get him fired.",

    "text": "I have been here on a number of occasions.  I love the rib tip appetizer and it fills me up for only $9.  I love their BBQ sauce more than anything and you can purchase it whihc is a HUGE BONUS.  I am not a fan of their ribs because they're a bit tougher than my taste but the BBQ sauce is so good I use it on food from other venues.  I like the fried okra as well as the Raspberry lemonade is sooo good. The mac and cheese is good too as well as a few other appetizers.  I more so come here for happy hour and the appetizers offered during happy hour.  They have great drinks (liquor) and I always sit at the bar and I am always treated with great customer service.  Overall I love this place and they always strive their best to make sure the customer is happy even when they have a slip up.",

I was excited to try the place because my parents had really talked it up, but maybe I just went in with too high of expectations. The hostess had misplaced a few brain cells and asked our party about 5-6 times what our name was, even though they had one of our numbers to call when the table was ready. Our water was ok, but super slow when it came to the checks and actually checking in on us. I liked the biscuits, but they were not amazing, a nice touch after waiting for so long to get a table though. No one in my party was amazed by their meals but one of the most disappointing was the mac and cheese. It sounded so good, but came out dry and mushy- gross enough to turn you off of mac and cheese for a couple of weeks.  So-so food, extremely loud restaurant- it will take a while before I consider to give it a second shot.",

    "text": "0 stars.  No.  Negative five!!!!  This was the worst attempted dining experience I've ever had.   A complete fustercluck of a restaurant.  Perfect candidate for that restaurant impossible show.  TONS of tables empty but told there would be a 30 minute wait.   Grabbed a table near the bar and a waitress took our happy hour drink orders.  20 minutes later still no drinks.  They told us our table was ready and the table they had  for us was almost on top of the hostess table where about 12 other customers were crowded around waiting for tables.  The fact that they would even seat people there is Sad.  (This table btw was empty when we first came in so I don't understand the 20 minute wait for the crappiest table in Town)  We said we didn't want to sit there and they told us it would be ANOTHER 20 min for another table even though there were many empty tables in the restaurant and on patio.  We said we'd go back to our table near the bar and have our drinks there which our waitress had said were \"almost ready\". We went back and the waitress brought our silverware.  We asked where our drinks were and she said they were coming out soon and they were really \"weeded\" tonight.  I said \"we've been waiting twenty minutes\" and she said \"I told them to hurry up already\" she then ran to the computer and typed something in so I don't think she ever put in our drink orders.  We look over at the bar and the bartender is chillin out, looking relaxed leaning up against the bar talking leisurely to a customer.  How long does it take Lucile's to pour a shot and a couple of beers?  I guess I will never know because my party was too impatient to wait more than 25 minutes for our drinks.  Got there at 6:30 to take advantage of happy hour- left at 6:54 very sober and hungry and too late to get to any other happy hours.  If they can't pour a drink in under 25 minutes, I can't imagine how long it would have taken us to receive food.  Everyone who worked there looked and acted like it was their first day on the job.  The only thing Lucile's succeeded in doing was giving me and my fam bam the blues.",

    "text": "Been here 4 or 5 times and have been very happy each time, with some exceptions on my latest visit (1-25-14).  I usually get BBQ chicken or Baby Back Ribs and they have always been great. I tried the fried chicken once, it was \"OK\".. the \"fried\" part just fell off when I cut in to it. No biggie though!  The service up until 1-25-14 had been outstanding and have no complaints about any of my prior visits. This past Saturday, my friend and I arrived around 6:30 and the place was packed like a sardine can. Upon asking for a table, we were told it would be about an hour (good for them for being so busy!). They suggested we could scout out the bar for tables and we did. We found two spots at the bar immediately and sat down.  We sat there for a few minutes at which time I took the buzzer thingamajig back to the hostess and let them know we found a place in the bar. I came back and my friend said the bartender came by and told her he would be right with us. After no less than another 10 minutes, watching that bartender and the other bartenders attend to guests seated at the bar as well as every Tom, Dick and Harry that came up to the bar for a drink except us, we had to flag one of them down just to get our order taken.   We provided the female bartender with our order and figured we would have a bit of a wait for food as busy as the restaurant was, so we watched TV and talked. The band started playing and while it was cool to have music, it was so loud, I couldn't even hear myself talking to my friend. I know I am starting to sound like a whiner, but seriously, it was loud!  Our salads arrived about 12-15 minutes after we placed our order and that was OK, but then our dinners came out within 2 minutes of that, surprising but now I have 90% of my salad and a full rack of ribs in a confined spot at the bar with all of us elbow to elbow. Difficult to maneuver everything without jabbing the guy next to me. The ribs were not as tasty as I have had before, really missing a lot of the BBQ flavor and I also noticed they didn't have as much meat on them as there has been on previous visits. Disappointing for the cost (I believe they were $26). They were still OK, just not good enough to get excited about.  Overall, I really like this place and I'm sure I'll return. I won't let this last experience ruin what had been very good everything up until then. I still recommend Lucille's if you are looking for good food and great service, but they'll have an off night from time to time like any other restaurant in the world.  UPDATE: not more than a few hours after posting the review above, I was emailed by someone I assume is from Lucille's corporate office apologizing for my most recent experience and thanking me for my feedback. No restaurant will ever be perfect every time, but how they handle customer complaints goes a very long way with me. His email to me sealed the deal and I will definitely return in the future.",

So I decided to visit recently and ordered a lunch dish with baby back ribs, chicken, and beef, with a side of mashed potatoes. My mother could make better ribs with more meat on them than what I had received at this restaurant. The sauces were disgusting and the waiter didn't even bother to give us biscuits even though they were complimentary. I tried the chicken, but it wasn't anything as expected and was definitely not up to par, this being a bbq restaurant. I didn't even try the beef and for three people we ended up paying around $65 with the tip for a very unsatisfied lunch and setting. I will not come back to this place of establishment.",

    "text": "A very enjoyable Barbecue chain. A lot of people have suggested that I try Lucille's but my desire to do so had been low. Probably because from the outside it looks like just another overpriced family restaurant. Now that I've been inside, it kind of gives you that impression when you walk in, too. There's a decent decor, but there's also all that junk on the wall that gives it an Applebee's kind of feel. Long lines to get in (mostly due to huge parties) also don't help out.   Fortunately, the food is really good.   You get biscuits with a side of maple butter which is quite enjoyable. We started with a half order of onion straws. Unless you're with a big group stick to the smaller size. Even though these fried strips of onion were addicting and hard to stop eating, it was still too much for just two people. The BBQ ranch sauce its served with is also really good (and I am not a big ranch fan).   Both my girlfriend and I had sandwiches as our meals. I went with the brisket and portabello with honey roasted peanut slaw. The brisket was wonderful. Not too soft like most places tend to serve it when in sandwich form. Can't say that I was a big fan of slaw. Nothing special about it, and the vinegar in the recipe just didn't do it for me, and the peanuts didn't add anything to the flavor, they just felt thrown in.   My girlfriend had the Smokehouse sliders with BBQ chicken. While they give you the option of pork, chicken, or brisket, Lucille's doesn't let you mix and match which you want. I really don't get that policy consider there isn't a price difference between the meats. It's not like they're smoking it up on order (and if they are, there's a big problem considering it takes hours to smoke meat). I guess it's too hard to the kitchen staff to grab from two different places. Either way, she enjoyed the chicken. She had a side of sweet potato fries which were really good.   Like most Barbecue chains, Lucille's pimps its own sauces. The three that were brought to the table were original (the best; loaded with flavor), Hot and Spicy (neither hot or spicy, not bad, just not close to what I was expecting), and Memphis style (I'm not familiar with Memphis style barbecue, but this was pretty much just ketchup). I recommend sticking to the original.   We chose to sit in the bar (open seating and full menu) to avoid a short Sunday night wait and watch the basketball game. There's four big TVs placed across the bar, but someone did a very bad job placing them in their spots. There's a couple of support beams in the room which block the views. We easily found a seat that allowed us to see the game were were interested in, but my view of the TVs playing the baseball game were blocked.  Overall, the place isn't much to look at, but the food is good.",

Some food items are good and others are not. Fortunately you're able to mix and match menu items with the availability of combo plates. Unfortunately, the chance of all those items being good is slim.  Sauces are good, atmosphere tries to be very southern and the menu offers lots of options.  A lot of the food served has more fat than meat though. Portions that should have been cut away are smothered in bbq sauce with the hope you won't notice.   There are better barbecue places in the East Valley, much less the South, which is what this place tries to pattern itself after.",

All in all, it was a good vibe.    Got the pulled pork sandwich and used the in-house BBQ sauce on top, it was very good.  My sister tried to order a shredded chicken sandwich but was told they do not have one and she will have to order shredded chicken sliders.  Not that big of a deal, but why couldn't the server just have someone put the shredded chicken on a bun and charged the same price as a pulled pork sandwich?  Anyways, the shredded chicken tasted awesome as well!",

We will visit again and would recommend Lucille's!  My husband is on a quest to find the best BBQ ribs--  Lucille's did not disappoint!  A nice touch is the warm wash cloths given to us at the end of our meal!  How thoughtful!",

Our waiter was incredibly friendly, but was in that too friendly mode.  I don't know if you know what I am talking about, but it seemed like he was so overly friendly that it was insincere.  And he was one of those type of waiters who was there every 5 minutes at the start of the meal, and no where near at the end of the meal.  We started our meal with their signature biscuits.  We are in AZ so I am sure the cooks do not really now how to cook a good biscuit.  Our nice flakey biscuit was hard and crunchy on the outside, and warm and not flakey on the inside.  The honey butter was marginal.  The onion straw appetizer was good, the best part of the meal.  I had a baby back rib combo with hot links and my friend had the chicken and rib lunch combo.  Same kind of ribs.  The ribs were dry and not very tender.  She said her chicken was good, and my sausage was cooked fine.  No real flavor to the sausage, just spicy.  Overall, as BBQ joints go, I wont be back.  Its hard to create the hole in the wall BBQ joint with a chain, and Lucille's has not done it.",

    "text": "Wow all the reviews for Lucille's are bad and yet I had a good time there last Friday night. Myself, Mark T, my friend Beth and her parents. Luckily Beth had a reservation as that place was packed. We had to wait a few minutes for our table to be ready but it was a good time for all of us to also catch up as I hadn't seen Beth's parents in over a year.   We get to our table and order some drinks which by the way are served in mason jars. Pretty cool except for the fact that the ice tea was a little weak. We ordered some fried okra which was fried to perfection and piping hot. It came with two different dipping sauces but alas I just at them like popcorn. Note to self, wait for them to cool down before poping them in your mouth because those suckers were HOT!   I ordered a full slab of ribs with greens and mashed sweet potatoes. OMG they were so good. The meat was falling off the bone and the sauce they used was a little sweet, just like I like it. I actually added a little more of their hot and spicy bbq sauce because I like both the sweet and spicy mixture of sauces on my bbq. The greens were ok but needed some hot sauce and the mashed sweet potatoes were good. I ended up taking most of my meal home because I got full off of the fried okra and as well as warm biscuits. My friend's mom ordered the exact same thing as I did, Mark T. ordered the chicken, in which he said was pretty good. My friend's dad ordered the tri tip in which he seemed to enjoy and my friend ordered the fried catfish in which she also seemed to enjoy.   For dessert, the snickers ice cream pie was ordered along with old fashioned banana pudding. I had a few bites of the snickers pie and it was really good. I wanted to eat more, but I was already stuffed and I didn't want to overdo it any more than I already had. I didn't try the banana pudding but my friends' father seemed to enjoy.   All in all, it was a good time. I mean the company I was with FABULOUS and the food was good. What more can you ask for on a Friday night?",

    "text": "We wanted to hang out at Tempe Marketplace and wanted BBQ and the band playing on Saturday night was a bonus. After reading the reviews, decided to try carefully try Lucilles.  The reviews for appetizers were very positive so didn't order one. I ordered the Memphis style pulled pork sandwich 10.99, hubby got the regular pulled pork sandwich also 1099. So far service was prompt and friendly after the food it got much worse. We casually ate our meal saw her serving other tables. We didn't need anything so that was fine but then we finished and the waiting began. I had half a sandwich left and hubby's drink sat empty for about twenty mins . She finally arrived with the check offered desert, a box for my sandwich and refills for my husband. I was thinking of getting another adult beverage but took too long for service. However, our waitress may have explained why the bad service. She said they work as a team, we could ask anyone in their black shirts for help. I was a waitress many years ago and remember some places pool the tips. So a server could be amazing but would have to share with the lazy servers. System doesn't work. I should note no other server stopped by or even made eye contact. However, our sandwiches were amazing, the pork was tender and had lots of flavor. The buns were not soggy, the sauces were fantastic. My husband liked his plain fries and my potato salad tasted fresh and well flavored. The prices for the sandwiches aren't bad.  The everything else is crazy. They push the lemonade but way too expensive, rather have a beer for the same cost.  They really need to fix the service and read the Yelp reviews. The place could be so much better and they should lower their prices or put a few more reasonable dishes on the menu. The sandwich and burger section that is reasonably priced. We will likely go back, but will not try anything new here. Lots of items sound good but not going to pay those prices to be disappointed.",

Call ahead if you get impatient waiting because you will have to wait here. You can sign in there and they will text you when your table is ready which is pretty cool. They have live music so it is really loud (makes sense a text msg if prob the only way to find you). We had a drink while we waited for our table, they even have a cute little area with couches where you can wait. Loved the loud and informal nature of this place.   Menu is ginormous as well as the portions. We got a 1/2 order of fried pickles and onion strings to start ( the 1/2 portions look to me like what i would consider a full portion,, just ridiculous amounts of food).  both got the baby back ribs. All your normal bbq fixins' to choose from to go with your entree. order came with this biscuits that i swear tasted like they had sugar on them with an apple butter of some sort that was just sinful.   Everything was great, had no room for dessert and i didn't even finish 1/2 my baby back order.   this place will be an every now and then splurge as i think i am still burning off the calories .",

We went for happy hour and I got the fried green tomatoes and the spinach artichoke dip. There were two slices of tomatoes on my dish so you really do get what you pay for.  There was not a salad that was not drenched in fat, bacon, eggs, cheese etc.  That being said, I realize this is a barbecue joint so if you're in the mood for barbecue they have tons of it! I had a team of barbecue lovers with me, and they were very pleased with the tri-tips and said they were amazing. Happy hour prices are really good. But if you are a veggie lover, in a group of meat lovers, just be aware that you will have a hard time finding something decent to eat.",

We decided to get a drink in the bar while we waited and boy did we wait!!! We waited about 5 min, a waitress walked by and said ill be right with you. After another 5 minutes she dropped off menus rushed next to the couple that sat after us and took their drink order and then ran off again for another 5 minutes. She finally comes by and we tell her we just want to Order a drink.  She runs off and this time is fairly decent at coming back with a drink and we ask for the check right away afraid that we won't see her again. She brings us the check and by this time our table is called.  By the time we get the check it took about 25 min to get one drink from the bar....  The food is a bit pricey but comes in very large quantities so take the leftovers home and its worth the money. Dinner for two cost $50. It southern style so if you like that type of food you have a lot of options. When it comes time to pay the check my husband realized the bar waitress still had his credit card. Why did she not bring it to him since she knew we were dining in???   I know that busy nights are difficult but a little courtesy goes a long way.",

I almost always come here with my boyfriend when we feel like having a great dinner night out...located right at tempe marketplace, you can walk right to the theater from there. I always order water with lemon at restaurants, but here it has to be the sweet tea...the huge mason jars with mint are a great combo...yummy:)  The weekdays are quieter, but on the weekend they have a band playing the blues, so I dont' mind waiting for a table while listening to the music.  The place is very comfortable, the staff is always helpful and welcoming..   The smoked chicken pasta is delicious, they used to have a pork chop plate with a tasty glaze and a sweet potato pancake, which was a favorite, but it's no longer served:( I don't know why i'm even mentioning it, but guess we both can't have it anyway, sweet memory i guess...haha  Fried green tomatoes very good as well for a starter, if you order the rib tip as a starter you might not have room left for main course,They have huge portions so expect to take some home or share with someone. My boyfriend usually orders the catfish or steak, he's never had complaint- had a few bites myself, they are both really good.. The gumbo and jambalaya are very tasty and spicy, but more hot sauce never hurts....  All in all, the place is relaxing, the food is great And the staff is very friendly..",

Before I could eat this delicious bowl of gumbo, I had to remove a total of 6 Bay Leaves from 1 serving of gumbo. I believe Bay Leaves are a very low return when it comes to flavor, but I'm not opposed to cooking with them. YOU DON'T LEAVE BAY LEAVES IN THE FINISHED DISH. I tried to explain this to the manager who came to our table, but she clearly does not understand the potential hazard of consuming BAY LEAVES! She said it was the decision of the Executive Chef to leave the bay leaves in the dish. Hey Executive Chef, NO NO NO. BAD CHEF!!!!!  If I had made the mistake to bite into one of too many bay leaves in the gumbo, the conversation between me and the manager would have been QUITE different. I was not looking for a freebie or gratis an any way, I just wanted to make the management aware of this cooking mistake sponsored by your Ex. Chef. I won't be back, but you might want to address this before you hurt someone.",

I was very happy there was ample waiting area and the staff was very friendly. I went with my brother we waited less than 10 minutes for our table and this is on a Saturday at a busy dinner time . We were seated and immediately assisted by our waiter who was very attentive & explained the menu with any questions we had. Now if you've read any of my other reviews I am always a stickler for the menu explanations. there were some issues the wedge salad as the menu didn't state that it came with a lot of onions which I am NOT an onion fan but if you are then you will like the wedge salad. However the rest of our meal was delicious. I got the full rack of ribs with a baked potato and corn on the cob and this is just that little half corn on the cob you get the full  corn on the cob. My brother got the brisket which was delicious as well I wished I would have ordered that instead because I love brisket. the other wonderful thing is the food is not smothered in some sauces or even in the barbecue sauce itself.. The service was wonderful the food was delicious served hot and quickly and then we were on our way! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes to eat barbecue it's great for large groups. the only drawback which is why I didn't give it 5 stars is the waiting around is a little awkward in the front of the building where people are milling about and it's difficult to get through at times  people should be directed that they do not have to stand right in front to wait. I always find having to maneuver my way to put my name down for a table is always a pain. and with only one way in and one way out that's interesting during peak times. however we thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the service was great we will be back!",

I'm not a fan of the whole corporate shtick and this place is well.. all shtick.. from the 'leg lamp' to the bottle caps glued on the wall this place is actually more kitsch and not in a good way. I would like to say though that the chair I sat in was SO comfortable that I could sit and stare at all the crap on the walls for hours. I mean seriously, there is tons of stuff on the walls there, dizzying.   Being the adventurous one, ordered the fried pickles.. ya know you had to order at least once to say you tried them.. well, I wouldn't order those again.. let's just say I like my pickles firm! I ordered the trip tip salad for my lunch.. not much to say about it.. it was what it was.. overly sweet bbq ranch dressing with a few pieces of tri tip (was very tender) all covered in cubes of cheese. In fact none of us even ordered the ribs *sigh*.   The service was super slow though food is priced well and the portions very large. Typical corporate experience not to good, not to bad just ho hum.. will probably not return. Prefer Joe's BBQ for the time being.",

Cute decor, very southern style feeling with a fun vibe.  Food: everything we ordered was amazing. Finger licking good. Started with the burnt end pieces (can't remember the name but it's from the appetizers) and it was so so so good. Also got the friend okra which was also delicious. I ordered the blackened catfish with mashed potatoes and veggies and I loved it. It was blackened perfectly! I had them out the sauce in the side in case I didn't care for it. My bf ordered the backyard favorite (not sure if that was the exact name) which came with ribs, chicken and some other meat. I tasted all three and they were awesome!!  I don't think you can go wrong with any of the items on their menu. Would love to go back especially since it is too hot here to BBQ yourself.",

    "text": "Two-stars is all I can conjure up for Lucille's and that's because the food was pretty good. What else is there, you might ask? Well, our server did an extraordinarily POOR job.  We've eaten here before and were never particularly impressed with either the food or the service, but we ate here for our anniversary. We ordered one of their big salads and the two-meat dinner platter.  Both dinners were $$$, but good - the brisket burnt ends and the baby back ribs were  tender and tasty, and the sides were equally good.  It was not busy (week night) when we were there, but for some reason our server pretty much ignored us for the entire meal. She presented us with the check without asking if we wanted dessert (we did), she never refilled our drinks (I finally asked at the end and she took my glass, but never returned with my drink - we asked a passing server and a to-go glass of tea showed up a bit later), and after desert was served and an extended time had passed we had to ask for the check again!  When you're paying a premium price for dinner, one expects the service to be a cut above average.  In this case it was several cuts below average.  I was really disappointed in the service and although the food was pretty good, it didn't match the cost. We probably won't be back until we forget about this experience. . .",

By the time we got our food, no one in our party was even hungry so we just left.   What a waste of $$$$  Oh, and I'm tired of everyone on this site calling it apple butter.  Anyone from the south knows what apple butter is, and this is not apple butter.    What they give you is butter with cinnamon and sugar in it, NOT apple butter (so don't go here expecting apple butter).",

I heard Lucille's had it, I tried it, and it is \"OK\" - about as good as Church's Chicken or Cracker Barrel offerings - but nothing to write home about.  I also tried their fried green tomatoes - they were good, but were in some kind of sauce - I prefer just the fried tomatoes - so next time I will ask for no sauce.  I like to eat vegetables so I asked if they have a veggie plate like Cracker Barrel - nope!  I also tried their onion strings - very good.  The meats are all good as well but leave your mouth very dry (MSG perhaps).  The best item is their biscuits.  I would just order biscuits and fried green tomatoes next time I go.  Oh, it is kinda pricey, too.",

It was truly good. Even had a slice of watermelon with it.  We had green fried tomatoes as an appetizer. So so on that not too good.  Dinner was quite good though. BBQ chicken, some ribs and briskest We had enough to bring home for yet another dinner Our server was very good, her name was Allison. She went into a lot of detail about the menu items.

I really like how they all let you know that they work on a team system, and any member of staff can help you. Any place with a veggie burger option gets and extra star! Haven't tried their veggie burger yet, but will be back soon!  This would be a very cute place for a baby shower, engagement party, or any party. Not sure what the party platter pricing is, but has to be cheaper! Really unique place to hold a party or go to lunch with a friend. They have about 6 different rooms/patios with hip surroundings.  Did I mention you can hit potentially 4 pokestops from the bar? We frequent bars based on pokestops and this is one of the best places in the area to grab a cold one while playing Pokemon!  Really cool decor, nice staff, seem well trained. Only thing I would ask is maybe more veggie options? I know you are a Steakhouse, so it doesn't make sense... but if you give mushrooms instead of chicken on the stuffed potato? Things like that, so veggie customers want to bring their BBQ loving friends back for the great experience I've had!   Thanks Lucielles and staff!",

When our server did come back by, I said the food was gross but I guess she didn't hear me and walked off.

Our waiter took our orders and said he would bring out some biscuits. And the wait began...  We were on the patio with little wait traffic. We did not get refills until our main course arrived. At that point, I told him that we never got our biscuits, salads or refills. He apologized, as did the manager, who took $10 off our bill. These things then came right away. One friend and I chose a feast for two, that comes with dessert. On placing our order, we told him what we wanted. However, he later returned with a dessert menu. I reminded him what we ordered. After quite some time, he returned and blamed the delay on kitchen staff. Our food was delicious and plentiful but the service shortcomings were not sufficiently overcome.",

The sides were pretty good as well.  No complaints on our end except for possibly the ribs...not our favorite.  Our daughter ordered a burger and she enjoyed that as well.  Oh, and I can't go without mentioning the biscuits and apple butter that you are given on arrival.  So good!  The staff was pretty friendly and attentive.

The burgers were done well, and tasty.  My corn on the Cobb side was soggy, maybe not the best choice.  I thought the portions were small for the price, a large group would be costly.  The atmosphere was comfortable and clean, well lit and decorated.",

The biscuits with apple butter were yummy.  LOVED the watermelon iced tea.  I think that was my favorite part of the whole experience.  Had the tri tip dinner with garlic mashed potatoes and coleslaw.  The tri tip was not the best I'd ever had.  I was actually a bit disappointed.  The garlic mashed potatoes were so incredibly garlicy that I had to dip each bit into BBQ sauce to mask some of the strong garlic flavor.  It was fun to taste all the sauces though and enjoyed them all.  After that the coleslaw had zero flavor, none!  To full for dessert.",

He and they were very helpful and knowledgeable and didn't try to rush me at all.  By this time on a busy holiday most restaurant people have had it and don't want to deal with the public anymore....if they felt like that then they hid it really well.

We started in the bar with cocktails while we waited for a table to open. My boyfriend had a draft beer and I had a well margarita, the drinks were prepared right in front of us in no time and the bartender was so friendly!  Once at our table we shared the 1/2 order of onion straws, and I had the Kansa City chicken sandwich and he the big smokestack. Both were good!! We also had their biscuits and honey/cinnamon butter. My only qualm was the sweet potato fries seemed to be a little over cooked and the ranch dressing wasn't that good - tonight.  I highly suggest this restaurant for a date night or birthday dinner!  Our total for drinks and dinner with tip was about $70!",

You have to have their apple butter and biscuits.  They only bring you enough for your party, but you can and should ask for more.  It's like starting with dessert.  Try sharing a sampler plate between two people.  I like ordering the Back Porch.  I tend to try different sides, but the one I find myself ordering the most is the garlic mashed potatoes.  If this isn't enough food then I recommend the Feast for Two.  There is plenty of seating so this is a good place to go when you're with a group.  It's located closer to the Harkins side of the shopping center, so park on the back side of the complex as the front is usually busier (closer to river).",

It wasn't very busy, yet service was super slow. If you've read any of my reviews you know I have a bell pepper allergy. I explained this twice and they kept telling me they use black pepper on the grill. Well I'm fine with black pepper, just not bell pepper!  We finally get past that and order burgers cooked medium. When the burgers finally come out nearly 30 minutes later they're burnt and dry and hard. Way to treat that fine meat you used ... I couldn't even eat mine, and the mac n cheese was also awful, with no flavor, little cheese, and improperly cooked.   All in all such a disappointing experience I'll never return. My friend was even more adamantly against ever trying them again.   But if you like a burned dry burger give them a shot, surely someone goes more than once.",

Seriously the Diet Coke was the best I ever had I k is it's weird but you can judge the quality of a restaurant if they get the beverages right. The care to everything shows here. We got the two person feast. For the first course the chicken tenders. Outstanding can't say I ever had better maybe back in jersey at stuff your face. It came with honey mustard and then three kinds of bbq on the table. I'm not a fan of bbq sauce but the hot bbq sauce was amazing.   Then the salad also great. It's tough in Arizona to get a good house salad.  The biscuits I also loved. It's not miss knots but I'm ok with apple butter. Can't say I loved the apple butter but I did enjoy trying it  I picked burnt ends which was a big mistake they are moist and fatty. I don't like fatty meat.   My fiance loved the chicken. I forgot to say I don't like chicken. But I did love the chicken tenders  The ribs I think we had two kinds are amazing. They are smoked and the flavor is out of this world.   Honest the only think I didn't like was the corn in the cob. It's tiny cornels and over cooked not my think. I like roasted corn at the reni fest or Jersey sweet corn this is not what they serve.   I recommend this place and I'll be back soon. And ask for savanna she was great. My new favorite server. There was a server at chop that used to be my favorite but he moved and doesn't work there anymore. But I would say this place is tied with chop for my favorite place to get a meat and potatoes    Second visit I got jambalaya extra spicy and it was great. Perfect spice for me and great flavor. One flaw was the shrimp could have been cooked more. I tend to like shrimp well done. My girl had the pulled pork and potato salad which I tried and found perfect and very tasty as well.",

    "text": "My husband and I went for lunch. There was one woman in front of us speaking with one of two hosts when we arrived. The two of them couldn't quite figure out where to seat her in a restaurant laden with empty tables. They also didn't acknowledge us with even \"I'll be with you in a moment.\" After patiently waiting, we asked to be seated in the enclosed porch, which was fine. It took a while for our server to come, but she was cheerful & pleasant. Thought our lunch may be looking better, but no. Remaining service pretty slow (even with what they called the \"team approach\"), portions small for the price, food bland, barbecue sauces average at best, cornmeal crusted catfish and shrimp very heavy. Not impressed at all. There are many other barbecue choices in the Valley with excellent food, service and prices so we won't be wasting our time at Lucille's again.",

    "text": "How depressing!  We used to frequent the Lucille's in green valley Nv.  I think it was one of the first and it was good good good.  So good we would do our business entertaining there.  When we moved home to Az we were very excited to find that they were putting one in Tempe.  Our first visit was good, but for some reason not as good as Vegas, but they were new and we figured they needed a chance to get started.  Second visit, still not so good, third visit, decided not to go back.  That was awhile ago.  Today, my daughter wanted to have lunch there and she only remembers the Nv Lucille's as she has been in Wa.  for a few years.  So we went.   Here's how it went...... She had a Cobb salad and ordered with no eggs, came covered in eggs, sent it back.  Came back with raw chicken......worried me cause although she took it off her salad, it had still touched the rest of her salad and she is breast feeding.  Her husbands fried chicken was so bad that he wouldn't eat it and that boy eats like crazy.  My son had the tri tip that was melt in your mouth in Vegas, but not here.  It was tough and fatty.  I had the sea food platter.  It was something I had never seen. It looked like it was coated with corn meal plastic.  Burnt corn meal plastic.  I peeled it off and there was a teeny tiny piece of cat fish in there.  The grilled artichoke was ok but the dip was wall paste, the fried okra was good, but hey, it's not fresh, it's frozen.  The sweet tea was wonderful and our waiter was nice.  Bottom line......go to Green Valley, next to Vegas.........skip Tempe.  It cost 92 dollars to eat lunch at Lucille's and I use the term \" eat\" loosely.  I feel like I was robbed!  Not one of us was happy.    I have a lot of good memories at Lucille's years ago, but that was then,  and  this is now.......and now they suck!!!",

My kids love the baby back ribs and burgers. Hubby loves the chicken and fried pickles. I love the smoked brisket salad and fried green tomatoes! Their sides are yummy too!  Don't sleep on the dessert! The red velvet cake is on point!  On one visit, we were offered 3 free desserts to take home. THREE! Why? Because our food came out late. Really? We hardly noticed! We didn't complain nor ask. What a way to be proactive with customer service! That alone will have us coming back again and again!  Their live entertainment is slammin' on Saturday nights! Especially if you like New Orleans/southern-style blues and jazz.  Visit Lucille's and have a fun time (and leave full as a tick!)!",

Her favorite is the pulled pork mine is the Kansas City ribs, but we always have to start our meal off with the fried pickles.  If you're on a tight budget even buying one meal and sharing it is a definite option.  Sometimes I get full on the biscuits and spread the provide in the beginning.  The bar area is a great place to have a meal and watch a game.  I would highly recommend this establishment to any of my friends.  But make sure you get the fried pickles... you will not be disappointed.  Oh yeah.....please please please order the Mac 'N Cheese as your side.  You will thank me later.  Q",

I thought it would be years before I was back in a town with a Lucille's, but just a couple months later, a trip to Phoenix gave me another opportunity.  I visited the Tempe Marketplace Lucille's.  The service was fantastic!  Kudos to the waitstaff.  They actually worked as a team, each helping the other when needed.  The food was good, but the baby backs I had tonight were not as good as the blacked fish I had in Vegas.  Guess I shoulda stuck with the fish.  However this restaurant has redeemed itself, and when I have the chance, I will be back.",

The private room we were in was freezing so we asked to turn it off and they server said he would do it ASAP, which he did, but it took 15 minutes to do so. Then as he finishes taking our order, he asks if we want biscuits and apple butter while we wait... Uhm hello apple butter, Yess please. About 20 minutes later 9 out of 11 meals come out, no biscuits yet. Then finally the biscuits come, so much for those coming out while we wait) and my food comes right after. We still had one person who had no food. I will say I was happy when the manager came and addressed the issue saying it should have come out with the rest of the food. She graciously took her meal off the check. Yes we had a larger group but none of us ordered complex food like ribs or pulled pork. Majority was chicken sandwiches.   My chicken sandwich was pink in the middle and I didn't notice until I got into the middle. Everyone was done eating so I just gave up. Now as I sit here at 4 am, I am wide awake due to being sicker than a dog all night.   I'm sorry for the one star but food poisoning is no joke. I will say that the apple butter lived up to its name.",

I called several other happy hr establishments on same said holiday and they all still had it, so I feel justified in thinking that's really bizarre and uncommon.

The breading is very thick and there is no green tomato taste at all. I ordered the Texas brisket sandwich - very good. Also got the peanut slaw. Hmmm. Very vinegary - couldn't finish it. My husband got the fried shrimp and catfish platter. Same thick, burned batter on the shrimp and fish. He said he could taste nothing at all but batter. Skinny little fries that are impossible to eat and turn into cold mush very quickly. Biscuits were good, but the place is way too expensive for the quality of the food.",

I've been here quite a few times but never wrote a review.   The place is decorated somewhat southern and very welcoming. We were surprised that we were seated right away and the server was right there to greet us. Nice.   We started off with the biscuits and apple butter. The apple butter is so good. I'm glad we didn't have that many biscuits cause we would have filled up on that. Anyways, I had the brisket with Mac & Cheese and corn on the cob. The brisket was really good with the extra BBQ sauce smothered on it. Tender and juicy. The Mac and cheese was very good and the corn on the cob was smothered in butter and was cooked just right. My wife had the fried catfish and shrimp. Very good. Catfish was very moist and crispy on the outside. Also, the shrimp was cooked just right. Just the right portions for my wife. So overall the food was very good. Enjoyed the food and company.   As for the service. Really good. Our server greeted us. Very friendly and kept on checking on us. She didn't have to fill up our water cause they bring you out these huge jars for your drinks. Also, the greeter were very friendly and smiling all the time. Very welcoming.   Overall I enjoy our time there. Good food and service.",

Highly recommended, especially, of course, if you're a fan of barbecue. 5 stars!  P.S. You're offered a warm, dampened towel once finished with the food to clean up.

The barbecue sauce that came with the ribs was close to perfection. I wish I could have tried all the sides, I picked the corn on the cob and potato salad. The corn was really good, the potato salad could have used some more flavor. The service was super friendly and attentive, we couldn't have asked for more. The gluten free menu clearly stated what's okay to order for me. Next time we might try the bar, it looked very inviting and cozy.",

    "text": "I think the best way, for me, to describe Lucille's is \"It's Pretty Good.\"  Let me preface, though. My mothers half of the family is super-country. I was raised by my grandma for my first 10 years of life, so I like to think I know how southern dishes are supposed to taste. They are literally from a town, in Kentucky, named Turkey Creek. How back woods is that? Therefore, my taste for Southern cooking is fine tuned, but I'm trying to loosen the reins a little bit while typing this review.  The restaurant is cute, the service is fine, and while the food is nothing to write home about, it's good. The hot towels at the end of our meal, were honestly the highlight for me. They were accommodating to our party of 20, and I don't think anyone had anything necessarily negative to say.   For me, it was just missing SOMETHING. The meat wasn't as tender or flavorful as I would anticipate from a self-proclaimed \"smokehouse.\" The sauces were just alright. I'm comfortable with saying, they dropped the ball on their cornbread recipe. Those biscuits, though, they get a 10/10. I also thought everyone's flavored teas were pretty cute with the fruit floating in them.  Although it's a chain, I wish there were something that stood out to me to make me say, \"We should go to Lucille's.\" - Nothing crazy bad. I've just had better BBQ, in the valley, and at a shyer price point.",

We sat in the bar of their Flying Pig Lounge to enjoy some \"reverse happy hour\" specials, then we found out that happy hour goes all day every day and we could have sat anywhere :-) All good, the bar and lounge area turned out to be great! The atmosphere is really relaxed and open and fun. There is memorabilia everywhere, the seats are soft and comfortable, the tables are big, there are TVs to watch and the style is simply comfort, great music, barbecue and throwback.  Stephanie was our server and she could not have been nicer or more attentive. Same with the bartender, she was awesome also. Both were friendly and offered recommendations and were simply nice humans that took great care of us, they instantly felt like friends.  The food was excellent. We ordered off the happy hour menu and the food portions were enormous! The drink prices were great and the volume was also excellent. They bring you complementary homemade rolls with butter to start, that coupled with large portions and we were staffed by the end. We enjoyed the Lucille's onion straws, the Memphis pork loaded fries, and the barbecued rib tips. Yeah, it was a real health fest! All were delicious and honestly those three happy hour specials could have easily fed four people. The two of us were staffed and had to leave some of the onion straws behind. In priority order, the rib tips had to go first and the pork loaded fries second, you understand :-)  The value was excellent. We were out of there with plenty of food and a couple drinks for under $30 and the service, the atmosphere and the food were all very good.  I'd go back in a heartbeat and definitely recommend Lucille's Barbecue.",

I'm a fried pickle snob so yes I just flavor and these were really good and done well. The sandwich was stacked high with pork. It was a tad dry but the Lucille's signature BBQ sauce was amazing in it. The bar area was really big and comfortable and the staff were really responsive to our needs.

No-can-do... unfortunately there goes my attempt today for meal planning.  Second choice was burnt end BBQ tip salad with dressing on the side. Other guest had a burger and fries. Third person had brisket plate with a side. One iced tea. Sticker shock on the bill with tax about $66. No wonder they don't put prices on their online menu.  Two guests received their order. Server said they had to redo the salad because the kitchen did not put dressing on the side. Finally got the salad as others finishing their meal. The salad was very tasty and I took half home.   Guess Tempe Market Place is a high rent area and good BBQ is not cheap. Not my first choice for dining but good to know. I left a generous tip but probaby won't be back for another year.",

    "text": "We're driving through Greater Phoenix and are staying in nearby Tempe.  It was my  sister-in-law's birthday and she felt like BBQ.  Lucille's was our second choice and we also wanted to see Tempe Marketplace.   We got there at about 7:45 and it was packed! We had 30-40 mins to wait so we just left our name and phone number for them to txt when our table is ready.  It's a good thing I stayed behind while the rest of my party checked out the outdoor mall. The text for our table never came; I contacted my party when I heard them yell out our name.  Our waitress was friendly and talkative.  She had lots of suggestions for our drinks and meals.  I chose to go with her recommendation of an El Pepino margarita, a lime/cucumber tequila mix.  The bartender certainly didn't cheap out on the tequila and the drink was not too sweet and was very refreshing.  Our drinks and onion straw appy arrived right away.   For our meal, I chose the 7 oz BBQ tri tips with mac and cheese and the mixed veg.  It took almost 45 minutes for our meals to arrive and our waitress came by to apologize for the delay saying that the kitchen is getting killed.  Our waitress also very busy with plemty of tables and seem distracted; we had to ask multiple times for a straw and the 2x requested ketchup never came.  When we finally got our meal, I dug in to my sides: the creamy al dente mac and cheese with some cheddar melted on top, the sauteed mixed veg of string beans, carrots and onions were nicely seasoned. They were excellent sides.  Sadly, my BBQ tri tip was a bit tough and dry, and seem to be missing that smoke element.  The thin jus that came with it was not effective in adding to the flavour.  We were also brought biscuits with apple butter.  The biscuits were still warm but it had a sugar sprinkling on top which was reminiscent of a scone which I love eating for breakfast but moy for dinner.   I also got to taste the baby back ribs with the original BBQ sauce.  It seemed like the ends were burnt and were tough and not crispy.  I was hoping my sil's birthday meal would have been better.",

They are meaty the right amount of char on the outside and when you bite into them it down right pops with flavor Gotta get them naked so you can apply your own sauce and this is a long run on sentence with bad punctuation and grammar but I don't care because I LOVE BEEF RIBs.  don't worry about the sides its so hard to screw up a baked potato, and corn. But it's even harder to find fabulous BEEF ribs.   Closing if you haven't had beef ribs and feel the True carnivore nature of human you need to. Throw your table manner out and be reckless in you devouring of meat the way it was meant to be. Messy, dirty and o so beautiful.  Go enjoy the BEEF ribs.",

Now this restaurant is better suited when you come with a group of people as many of their menu items are sold in family size combos, and can be a bit pricey if it is only two people. However even then this place is a good splurge as the food is down right amazinggg! Their lemonades are delicious and unique and their bread is so fluffy and savory! If you're in the mood for some bb, go to Lucille's you won't regret it!",

The website screwed up the time we wanted so I called to verify our reservations for 4 people at 6 pm.  The kid I spoke to was obviously confused because he booked us for 6 people at 4pm.  When we got there they didn't have our reservation but quickly got us seated anyway.  Kudos for good customer service. The food is very good, we ordered a selection of meats and enjoyed the different sauces.  The desert menu is small so we passed,  Not crazy about sitting right by the kitchen but the service was fast.  Not with 5 stars but certainly a strong 4 is in order.",

While helping my baby sister move to Arizona, I saw Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que, while walking around Tempe Market Place, and decided to try it.  I should have read the Yelp reviews first. =/  The place was packed, so I assumed that the food had to be pretty good.  Seeking solace from 100+ degree weather was really my first priority.  Yes!  I'm a wimp.  I was missing San Diego weather the moment I crossed the state line.  =(  Prior to being seated, we saw how big the plates were and between the four of us, split two combo platters:  the BBQ combo and the Porch combo. Each plate ran about $25.  Meats included babyback ribs, St. Louis ribs, beef ribs, pulled pork and a half chicken.  Sides included fresh vegetable medley, garlic mash potatoes, fries and macaroni and cheese.     The chicken, pulled pork and the St. Louis ribs were tasty.  The beef rib and the babyback was just alright.  The side dishes were nothing spectacular.    Compared to other places that I've tried, I wasn't overly impressed.  The price for a plate of food was pretty pricey, even with the portion sizes.  The side dishes were lacking. But, the customer service was great.  Would I go there again?  Not really.  I'm still in the hunt for some amazing BBQ.",

We were seated and waited for someone to come and take our drink order for at least ten minutes. No one showed, so I went to the hostess stand and asked if the server knew we were there since no one had come by yet. Shortly afterward, a manager came over, told us how great their service is and how they work as a team and then took our order. We waited, and waited, and waited some more. Usually one of the best things about a bbq restaurant is that the food comes out quickly. Not here! It was at least a half hour before we got our food, sans one side that wasn't ready yet. We finished eating and then had to wait again for a to go box and our check. (Server was oblivious and never looked our way so we could get his attention.) And by the way, the prices are sky high. Especially for BBQ, though the food was pretty good. Biscuits were delicious. Kind of a cross between a scone and biscuit...a little sweet.",

Order the \"cut with a spoon tender\" Tri-Tip, add some of their spicy sauce to the mop sauce it comes with.  The best.  I've torn myself away from the Tri-Tip a couple times.  The pulled pork sandwich was great, the meatloaf was massive and excellent . . . but nothing touches the Tri-Tip  Appetizers . . . I love the deep fried pickle wedges, and the crab cakes with the jalapeno tarter sauce were great too.    Not the cheapest place to eat, but Lucille's is one place where you truly still get more than you pay for",

The manager was super quick to get involved and get her a new one which was great, no harm done just be aware if you do have allergies to ask and ask again! Overall great experience really fun atmosphere and out of this world food!  Can't wait to go back!",

The sourdough bread tasted fresh and their sweet potato fries were as good as I've had anywhere. They leave 3 different BBQ sauces on the table - nice touch.  Although a chain, they did have both from San Tan Brewery and Four Peaks on tap. Two of each. A solid plus to the usual bud, bud-light, coors, coors light sameness.  I met up with one of my daughters (who bought me dinner), so the company was fabulous. The over ambiance is OK - good place to bring a group.",

I had Brisket and it had a perfect smoke ring around the upper layer, tender and I must admit it was almost as good as what I make.  I had a Margarita that was good as they come. Laura and I shared a Red Velvet cake - heavenly.  The reason I gave a 4 star would have to be the fried onion rings - when the manager walks by a table and asked \"How is everything\" you would think He or She would notice the full basket of fried onion rings, almost untouched!  I I said Greasy, that would not begin to cover them.  I thought the Manager or one of our servers would have asked  \"Was there something wrong with your fried onion rings\", but NO.  I will go back and will recommend to anyone to try them out But stay away from the fried and overly Greasy onion rings.",

    "text": "After the excruciating four hour long Barrett Honors College convocation ceremony my parents took me (new graduate) and my boyfriend out for celebratory BBQ. My dad talked Lucille's up like it was better than Pappy's in St. Louis. He raved about the biscuits, the ribs, and the apple butter for days before we attended my ceremony, and I was really excited to try the food. Disappointment does not even begin to describe our experience.  The restaurant was relatively empty at the time of our visit. The hostess sat us at a table that could, possibly, have doubled as the freezer. The AC was turned way to low on a relatively cool evening, and I was shivering throughout my entire meal. I know that this isn't the hostess' or the waitress' fault, but my mom asked several times if they could turn up the AC or move us.   The food was terrible. I ordered a full rack of ribs for $26.99 and they were burnt to high hell. Paired with the AC, my whole plate was cold in five minutes flat. I ordered Mac and Cheese as both of my sides and that was decent. My parents also split a burnt full rack of ribs, and my boyfriend had an average tasting pulled pork sandwich. We were served terrible quality food for the pricing of this restaurant.   Our waitress was really nice, but I think she should have noticed how burnt the food was that she served us. I understand that we visited the restaurant at 9:20pm on a Wednesday evening, but their website showed that they take reservations all the way until 9:30pm. It is just really unfortunate that this establishment doesn't take more pride in their product. People go to restaurants on memory making occasions, and a bad dinner can ruin a good moment. Lucille's would do better to remember that in the future.   TL;DR Burnt food, terrible for the price, will ruin your graduation experience.",

    "text": "THIS PLACE IS SO DAMN GOOD! I ain't even mad about the price. If you read any of my yelp reviews, you know that I am a notorious cheapskate. But for Lucille's... SHUTUP AND TAKE MY MONEY!   First, the atmosphere is all encompassing and full of 1920's-ish southern charm. My waiter was Ethan and he was super helpful! He recommended an awesome drink when we asked: half peach tea and half lemonade. It was delicious. We also got watermelon tea and half regular, which was also good. They come in huge mason jars with refills. We both ordered the tri-tip sandwich. It was PERFECT! They saute the meat in the BBQ sauce and also it has some sauce on it, throughout the meat. (Versus dry meat with a blob of BBQ on top.) There are also 3 different types on every table if you need more (you won't) but the way they make it, you can taste the meat and the sauce perfectly.   I got the garlic mashed potatoes (thanks to Ethan's suggestion) and my hubby got sweet potato fries. Both were delicious! At first I didn't think the sandwich and one side would be enough, but it was SO filling!    Oh, also they give you super yummy biscuits and THE BEST brown sugar butter. Yes, better than Texas Roadhouse and better than the butter Lo-Lo's gives you too. In fact, I don't even like the butters from those two places. So I was pleasantly surprised when I couldn't get enough of the butter at Lucille's. They also give you hot towels at the end of your meal to wipe up with. Genius!   The food was delicious, better than any other southern food I've had in the valley (which is the extent of my knowledge), they had excellent service, and the food came our super fast. We went on a packed Friday night and the service was just as good as if we had the place to ourselves.",

Nothing about the prices here are outrageous, and the portions...they're freaking huge! Being not much of a red meat eater, I ordered a simple grilled chicken sandwich. I couldn't finish it; there were two whole chicken breats, a mountain of *amazing* fries, and a fat slice of watermelon. Got it with a jar of sweet tea (perfect tea, by the way!) and a Maker's Mark mint julep that knocked me out of my chair. I also sampled some fried green tomatoes when were decent, and even  rib, which was the best I've had in the restaurant.  There are some poor reviews for this place, so let me preempt some complaints many of you would have while reading this review.  \"But Taric! The service was slow!\"  Even though it was busy, the server made my family and I feel comfortable and important. This is a large restaurant in the middle of a crowded urban center, they do their best and you should be patient.  \"But Taric...this isn't AUTHENTIC!\"  In a land of nothing but Chipotle this and somethingbertos, this is as close as you're gonna get, and they do a damned good job!  Quite frankly, this is the best BBQ I've had besides family cookouts. Ignore the yuppies giving it two stars and try it anyway...you won't regret it!",

The service was great, especially seeing as today is thanksgiving. I like their 'team' concept, everyone seemed very nice and helpful.   I did notice their systems were a little inefficient. In order to get a side of sauce, they put it into a computer that relays it back to the kitchen. I waited 15 minutes for a side of Ranch, which by then, I didn't even need. No fault to the waitress though. The hostesses were not very friendly either.   The others in my family got the Tri-Tip {supposedly melt in your mouth} and the cheeseburger. We were overall quite impressed. The onion straws were great! We will be back again.",

Inside, the ambiance and decor match her exterior; warm and hospitable.   If only the food was good.  I tried the barbecue chicken sandwich, it came with a choice of many sides...I selected the collard greens. Typically, when one goes to a barbecue joint, ordering the bbq chicken sandwich, the expectation is a large bun with shredded barbecued chicken piled high atop one of the buns. Not here.  Oh there's a large bun alright, but it's there for all the wrong reasons...serving as camouflage for what it's concealing.  At first blush, it looks large and delicious, but if you're a food sleuth like me, you'll want to inspect its contents.  Here are the results of my examination.  Removed top bun. Removed the kale leaves and glob of fried shoestring onions that gave it all its height. Huge disappointment, no chicken in plain sight. Only a large glob of melted cheese. Removed the cheese to find, and this is no exaggeration, a thin piece of chicken breast with a little barbecue sauce puddle it was swimming in. The size of the breast was approximately 2 x 2-1/2 inches, or roughly a third the size of the bun it was sitting in.  Try to imagine this.  This was like the motherlode of all things deceptive.   When I want a barbecue chicken sandwich, I want a huge glob of chicken slathered in sauce on a large bun.  Not the kind of False hope Lucille's is serving up.   Not going back. But I will admire the architecture as I cruise the parking lot. Lucille's sucks balls.",

We looked at the card activity, the card was never physically out of my hands... Except the 1 day at Lucille's.  Think about it, when is the only time your cc is ever out of your hands/sight? When the server takes it, walks away for a few minutes, and returns with your bill. The only place I ever used that particular card where it was physically out of my sight, was Lucille's..... 2 days later the multiple fraudulent attempted charges began.... Luckily my CC company declined every attempt, canceled that card, contacted me, and sent me a new card.......... I KNOW IT WAS THAT SERVER/BARTENDER AT LUCILLE'S.  The only reason I am not going there to beat the sh*t out of that kid, is because we have begun an investigation ......",

    "text": "Bad experience...Terrible service, terrible food.  First of all, I was organizing a Happy Hour and Dinner for a retirement party that we had on Friday, August 3rd, 2012.  Reading the fine print on the website it did say that happy hour prices were in the bar area, although because it was a party of 30 we could not fit in that area.  One of the attendees called the restaurant and spoke with the Manager which he confirmed that we were going to have happy hour prices. It turns out when we got to the restaurant they thought we were another party for 40 people that booked the spot for happy hour, but the attendee that spoke with the Manager was misinformed and they only gave us one round of happy hour prices.  Second of all, our server was awful.  There were a couple of servers that actually waited on us because there was a table of 10 people.  Anyways, she took wrong orders and did not listen to our needs and was rushed, rushed, rushed.  Then a new person came in late on our table, and she was not even served when she saw her.  We had to track her down. I am sorry but the amount of restaurants that I have been to, this was the worst service ever.  I mean I had servers that actually new who was new at the table and took their order once they arrived.  I ordered full size of fried green tomatoes, 1/2 order of fried okra, and a plate of sweet potato fries.  The server gave me my fried green tomatoes, but gave me full size of fried okra and the sweet potato fries was horrible.  So I had the server take my sweet potato fries because it was awful.  The server took it away without even asking me if I wanted another batch. I don't cook much, but I probably can fry those tomatoes alot better than the restaurant. I told the server I ordered 1/2 size of fried okra, and she said ok and brought it back to the kitchen then she brought the same dish back and said that she will just charge me for the 1/2 size order.    And lastly, when the server gave us the bill, it was all separate checks and did not even do that right.  The server was putting stuff on the bill that did not even belong on the check.  So needless to say...I AM NOT COMING BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN.",

The last time was descent so it seemed like a good option. Tie-breaker indicates the first review (negative) may be the more accurate. Again the food was good (but my friend wasn't happy with the gravy slathered all over the chicken. The issues with slow and incorrect service remained.  It took a while to get drinks, refills were slow and incorrect. Several people came in after us and left before us. Dessert was so slow we had to cancel it. They must make each cobbler from scratch as ordered because 15 minutes later we still had no pie. An additional displeasure is the restaurant is very loud - especially on the patio. It is hard to hear others at the same table due to the noise. Two hours for a Friday lunch for three is a bit ridiculous!",

It was extremely crowded with a lot of big parties. And despite all this, the service was incredible! Our waitress did a very good job of continually checking up on us and the food came out promptly after we ordered. And even if the service wasn't great, the food was exceptional! I got pulled pork and corn bread and both were delicious! I tried some of the food my family ordered and that too was very good. Plus, our table was in the bar so we were able to watch the baseball game and the golf tournament. Overall, my family and I had a very good experience at Lucille's!",

Loved the cozy area and the heaters kept us warm enough. The food was on point! Started with the fried pickle spears that came with a mustard sauce.... So good! Next our dinners - pulled pork sandwiches and southern fried chicken sandwiches. Delicious but my favorite had to be the sweet potato fries. Ask for the garlic mayo to dip them in! We shared dessert between all of us - bread pudding with bourbon sauce and banana pudding. Just the right amount to end our meal. Two other fun things.... the largest mason jar drink cups! My daughter's peach lemonade was so tasty. One of my daughters mentioned to waitress that the meal was so good for her Dad's birthday tonight and when she came back to get the check, she brought a birthday card signed by all of the staff. It was just an awesome experience from start to finish!",

I saw this and decided to try it out. When you walk in, it takes you back to the 1960's. It has old school booths and decor. The waiters are very friendly and knowledgeable about what's on the menu.  WHAT I ORDERED: A peach lemonade that was so sugary I had to send it back and I never do that. For the appetizer we got the green tomatoes and the fried okra. Green tomatoes weren't that great and tasted more like fair food because the batter was so thick. Fried okra was good. The sauces that it came with weren't that great. I actually was dipping the okra in the sauce that came with the tomatoes.  For dinner I got the tomatoes bisque which was horrible. It was very starchy and didn't even taste like tomatoes! :/  Overall the food was not impressive , border line cafeteria food.   The environment was amazing and that's the only reason why I'm giving it a 3 star rating.",

We ate at Lucille's last week for a late dinner, and everything tasted good, however, my 2 year old ended up with a slight case of food poisoning. She was up the entire night throwing up after we got home from dinner. I had found 2 hairs (after finding the 2nd hair UNDER my food, I came to the conclusion that they were not mine) on my plate and within my burger. I was only a two bites away from finishing my food when I made the realization that the hairs did not belong to me so I was mostly embarrassed that I ate the whole thing, luckily, I did not end up sick like my daughter. It seems that their kitchen may not be managed very well, or maybe it's just that it was 9pm and they didn't care. We had to take to my toddler to urgent care because she threw up well into the next day. So of course, there were co-pay fees and prescriptions we had to pay for. I wrote to Lucille's that very same day that we took her to urgent care which was 12/14 and still have not received any sort of acknowledgement from them. Also, I posted on their Facebook page and the same thing, no response. I guess it's the same upkeep of their kitchen, THEY DON'T CARE!",

    "text": "I have only been to Lucille's Smokehouse once in CA with my Ma and Uncle and it was fantastic! So, much so that when I found out there was once kinda close to where we lived I couldn't wait to take my wife there. We saved money and bought gift cards so we could take a late afternoon during a Saturday and go. My Ma got a gift card of her own too because we wanted to go enjoy the food and show my wife what we thought would be a great place to eat. It turned out not so much.  We went yesterday 5/2/2015 to this location and it was a very hot day. We drove from Glendale, AZ near 67th Ave and Bethany Home. Those in AZ and know what the heat was like yesterday know what that drive can be like. My wife has a heat condition so when we were seated on the indoor patio we sat there for a few seeing if it would cool down and her temp would as well but no such luck. So, we asked if we could be moved just inside where it was much cooler. A hostess came and got us and took us to the other side of the restaurant again tried to seat us just in another area of the inside patio. My Ma asked her for the free table that was just inside from where we had been to begin with. So there we were finally seated and finally could feel cool air.   We were forgotten several times. We got one order of bread which was hard like it had been sitting out for a long while. No butter with the bread. And then finally came our food and my Ma asked for fresh bread. The waiter said right away.  My Ma's food was fried chicken (tasted great!), grilled vegetables ( which were boiled and could tell by all the water on her plate), and then gravy for her mashed potatoes which should have had some thickness to it but was like water. I had mashed potatoes which tasted great, and steak which was suppose to be medium rare but was more like well and was more like a piece of carne asada I would get at a Mexican restaurant and the steak gravy tasted extremely different than it did from the one in CA like they had added a major spiciness to it. My wife got a  fried shrimp Po Boy to be simple since she didn't want to risk eating anything to heavy with the heat. The shrimp was small - medium size tasted okay. There was 2 tomato slices in the sandwich that were sliced so thick as if they should have been in a hamburger and very bad lettuce. (I would have taken pictures but I try not to take out/or have my phone on when I am out with my family)  I believe when we were just about done eating (about 20 min in) and no one had still come by to see how everything was and no bread still came I believe she was an assistant manager came by and asked how everything was. My Ma let her know how bad it had been. Talking to this manager for about 5-10 min and the waiter starts to come with the bread and she tells him we don't want it no more cause at that point we didn't. We had a very disappointing dinner. My Ma and I both felt bad to take my wife to such a bad experienced dinner.  The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because the district manager came over and talked to us apologized for everything and said she'd be sending us out some gift cards to hopefully try them again. And because even though a lot of it was wrong and didn't taste good, some did taste good and MAYBE we caught this place on a wrong day. If we do receive the cards as told then we will return and give it another try after the sun goes down though.  10/10/2015 So, it has taken me a while to come back and do this but I changed the stars to 1 cause about a month after posting this we finally received the gift card from them to go back and it was only for $25 when the manager had said she'd make sure we got all our money back in gift cards so we could go back and have a better experience. We still have the gift card and not sure when or if we'll use it here or wait and see when we can make it back to California or just sell it. Probably be the latter.",

They have a choice of sauces that are great. The service is really good and they are well informed about what they serve. I have tried different things and have never been disappointed. It is comfortable dinning. I like the music too, a jazz motif and memorabilia. I like the peach ice tea served in a mason jar!

    "text": "Recently ordered take out from Lucille's because it was Valentine's day, I had a craving for brisket and cornbread, and I really didn't want to deal with the crowds on the fore mentioned holiday.   Having been to Lucille's before I knew it was a fairly solid joint in terms of food and and service.   At least if you eat in.... ordering take out well lets just say it left a lot of room for improvement.    When I called up to order the phone was answered \"hello\" not something more akin to \"Lucille's this is \"insert name here\" how can I help you?\"  Ok it's a busy day I can let that slide.   I'm then put on hold (at least they asked if I would hold) for 5 minutes, the gentlemen gets on the phone and I start rattling off my order which he gets down and repeats back to me (for the record it was two 10oz Texas brisket dinners with sides of peanut slaw, regular slaw, corn on the cob, and mac&cheese).... sadly they do not have cornbread, just biscuits... man I really wanted cornbread.   I'm then told my order will be ready in 20 minutes.... I ask that it be ready around 6PM since it's 2:30 in the afternoon and I'm very much still at work doing this.  The gentleman taking my order changes.     So 6PM rolls around I walk in and the gentleman at the counter goes over my order has me sign a sheet saying that he reviewed the order and everything was in order I pay and off I go.  This is where I should have asked for little things like flatware, BBQ sauce, and towelettes.     So I go where I'm going and I get out the dinners for myself and the my friend and that's when the lack of flatware pokes it's head out.... then the brisket... it's ok but not great and could really use some sauce... and cornbread.... the corn on the cob is a dry and bland (probably a side effect of it being February and the corn being frozen), the peanut slaw is good, the regular slaw is serviceable. The biscuits are ok but in case you haven't noticed cornbread would have been better.    I wasn't thrilled with the dinner, it wasn't the worst BBQ I've had but it was no where near the best.   If I had to do it again I probably would have made the trek out to Dave's BBQ in Gilbert instead.",

He was very disappointed that the rib was the size of Tyrannosaurus Rex but had the amount of meat as a squirrel leg. He was expecting a meaty rib considering the price of the lunch entree. We sat in the bar area. Our service was below average. We waited to be acknowledged. We waited for our order to be taken. We waited for our drinks to be delivered. We never got checked on after our meal was served. Our drinks were not replenished. And waited even longer for our check to come. A $50.00+ lunch for two was not enjoyable.",

It seems that they haven't being able to figure out how many waiters/waitresses they need. 4th of July waiting time: 1 hour. They didn't say that the patio waiting time was 15 min and that in the bar is first come first serve.  Anyways, there's nothing not to like of the food.

I've had plenty of things on their menu but my favorite is the BBQ chicken! It's really juicy and not dry like other places that I've had BBQ. You get to pick your sides, their mac-n-cheese is great and the baked potato (which is huge by the way). If you go during the week, there is not much of a wait, however, if you go on the weekend...be prepared to wait. Clean restaurant and the staff is very accommodating and friendly. Highly recommend if you are in the mood for GOOD BBQ!!",

Our waitress had a perky personality and was great... It just took forever to get anything from refills to our check. And we could hear them telling customers walking in that's it'd be an hour and a half wait... I get why. I just think it may be understaffed for how liked of a place it is. Because it was packed.  We started with an artichoke thing and if you like fatty artichokes this isn't the place to get one. It barely had any meat on it. But I had chicken tenders, which is my go to when I go somewhere I don't really like their whole menu type of thing (I don't like pork what so ever, but it wasn't my choice). And normally I don't have an issue with chicken but this was almost sweet and I only ate a small portion. I got mashed potatos and corn bread on the side because well.. I'm at a bbq place!! Which both were great. My dad had ribs and ate every last bit. My grandma had a pulled pork sandwich which she enjoyed. It was overall ok, not somewhere I would eat because I don't like pork but everyone else enjoyed it(:",

The biscuits are super tasty and can be pretty dangerous...if you can limit yourself to just one, I applaud you!  We started off with fried pickles...I love that they are dill spears! They reminded me of the fried pickles I had in Miami last year.  They were delicious!  I got the beef brisket sandwich and it was fantastic! One of the perks is that they not only add sauce to the brisket, but they also have 3 bottles of sauce on the table for you to add to your liking: original BBQ, Memphis style BBQ, and HOT and SPICY (my favorite).  As a side, I stuck to the french fries which I now regret, because they weren't that great.  I knew I should have tried the cheesy grits!   My best friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and she said it was very tender.  Her side of choice as the Mac n'cheese...I sampled and me likey! Super cheesy and creamy!  There were only a couple of things I wasn't thrilled with: 1.  Our food took FOREVER to arrive after our appetizers.  However, the service was excellent and friendly! 2.  The sweet tea (which on the upside is served in a mason jar...I absolutely LOVE this), was beyond sweet! Next time, I'll order 1/2 sweet tea, 1/2 regular tea.    That's pretty much it.  We did bring home half of our food which tells you that the servings are large and worth the price!",

I played it safe and went for the Pulled pork sandwich. It was tender and moist with the requisite smokey flavor. It came with a decent amount too. I slathered mine with their hot bbq sauce and pigged out. It was good, You'll be fine with this.  Co-worker had a platter with ribs, pulled pork and smoked chicken. I tried the chicken and was surpised how moist and tender it was, replete with a delicate smoke flavor. I wouldnt even put anything on the chicken, it was that good.   At this point, I was mostly convinced that these items were actually smoked and prepared on site, at the restaurant. Forgive my skepticism, but real bbq takes a long time. And chain restaurants dont have a lot of credibility, at least not with me.  Skip the cheddar grits - Stick with fries for your side.   Bonus tip - avoid ordering beef brisket anywhere outside of Texas. You'll live with less regret.",

He knows who he is and I must say, hats off to you sir for caring so much.  My husband and I were extremely skeptical, but were expecting another flavor explosion and culinary button busting bliss as per usual when it comes to Lucille's and that fantastic kitchen of theirs. Again we expected the service to, well, suck.  Not the case.  Lucille's has taken on a Captain Planet-like \"LET'S COMBINE POWERS!\" attitude. Gasp! They've become a team! One that seats within SECONDS of a hunger crazed mutan-- I mean client, walking in the door!   Drink order came 5 minutes later, arrived on the table 5 minutes after that. And boy oh boy that strawberry lemonade is the bee's knees. Seriously. It's summer time in a mason jar, sweet and tart and I swear you can practically find yourself sitting on an old wrap around porch in a rocking chair after a few sips. Nectar of the Southern Gods. Hallelujah!  We then ordered our customary half an artichoke and just about died and went to heaven. There's something about BBQ sauce on roasted artichoke that catches the smoke and flavor of the entire establishment and then dipped in that garlic mayo? Yuuuuummmm.  Hubby surprised me this time. He ordered the Cobb Salad. Granted it was piled high with egg and chicken and bacon. He dug in, could only finish half -- two hours later at home he killed the rest of it and was quite pleased with himself. Only complaint there? It took 15 minutes after receiving the salad for him to receive his requested oil and vinegar, but no sweat. It was busy.  Me? Southern Fried Chicken all the way. I think there's a growing trend with me, and it has a lot to do with chicken. Love chicken. Especially fried chicken that's done right. Crispy, juicy but not greasy? Oh I'm so there.  Lucille's delivered. The chicken was PERFECT. And we already know how I feel about their squash medley and garlic mashed taters. Heaven. On a plate. I only finished half and then tortured my office with the other half at lunch the next day.  So Lucille's? Great job. I'm incredibly impressed and absolutely tickled pink by your budding success. I hope this is a progressive trend and y'all keep up with it.   I'll so be back.",

Some of the better BBQ in the area.  I look forward anytime I have the opportunity to visit a Lucilles.  Just can't wait till I go visit the Vegas one again!",

The Pulled Pork, Chicken and Ribs were AMAZING, but I think what really was the kicker is that AWESOME BBQ Sauce!!  I grab as many of them as I could and I put that sauce on all kinds of Meats.  If nothing else Grab a few Bottles to take home with you, you WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!",

It wasn't totally outside, but it wasn't part of the regular indoor seating, either.    Rustic charm with the comfort of a dependable chain.  Yummy food and very large portions.  The drinks are strong, and water comes in giant mason jars.    Since I had already eaten at Lucille's in California twice that month before coming here, I decided to get some fish instead of my usual BBQ meat.    I wanted to try the catfish but was told it would be spicy, so I went with the salmon instead.  You can get it smoked or grilled, and it's served with a generous portion of Creole rice and fresh vegetables and slathered with their New Orleans mustard cream sauce.  The food was really good and I was stuffed.    I also tried Lucille's Spiced Rum Punch, which you can get a 16 oz carafe for two, and it's cheaper than ordering two individual drinks.  ;)  It was a pretty pink color and sweet and refreshing.",

The biscuits arrived late into the meal and were cold.  What I thought were baby back ribs turned out to be St. Louis style.  (Partly my fault) A few of the side orders were wrong and it took some time for the waiter to reappear once the main course was served... That being said, once the waiter appeared and we had a chance to explain everything that was wrong with the meal both he and the management were very nice and fast in correcting everything.  Not only did they replace the sausage with another and correct the side order issue, they also provide myself with a set of baby backs on the house.  So, in closing, food not that great and pricey. But the service is absolutley A+.",

    "text": "We really wanted to like Lucille's, really, we did. I married a Southern boy, so as I was reading the online menu to him, he decided he really wanted to go. Unfortunately for Lucille's, we've already been to Bobby Q's and Lucille's just does not stack up.  DRINKS: Hubby had an interesting dark beer made by Albita Ale in Louisiana (although our server mistakenly said it was from Mississippi) called Turbo Dog which had some rich coffee tones. I am not usually a dark beer drinker, but I liked it too. I had the sweet tea which was served in a big mason jar with a sprig of fresh mint. It was sweet, but not LoLo's sweet (God love ya' LoLo's, but you're not exactly helping prevent the diabetes!) and that's a good thing.   APPETIZERS: Hubby just had to have him some fried okra. I tried two pieces to be a good sport, but the interior texture is something I just can't get over. He thought it was delicious and preferred the mustard dipping sauce over the spicy ranch. We were also served some biscuits (which we both felt were also made with some corn meal and this made them a little tougher) and some \"apple butter\" which was not really apple butter, but rather some sweetened butter tinged with cinnamon. Not impressive.  MEAT: Hubby had the brisket and I had the tri-tip. The brisket is so far superior at Bobby Q's in terms of tenderness. Lucille's wasn't awful, though, and the \"mop sauce\" which is different from the three sauces that were in bottles on the table (original, Memphis, and Hot & Spicy) was really good, and I usually don't like BBQ sauces. My tri-tip was very smoky in flavor, but rather dry. I asked for it dry (meaning no sauce) and was even challenged to do so by the menu itself which claimed that the True test of good BBQ was having it sauce-less. And so I did. And Lucille's did not pass the test on the tri-tip.  SIDES: Hubby had shoestring fries which we both agreed were delicious, and also the peanut slaw, which is a vinegar based cole slaw tossed with peanuts and peanut oil. It also had large pieces of yellow and red bell pepper in it, which made it inedible for me, but Hubby thought it was quite tasty and certainly different from any slaw he'd ever had.  I had the macaroni and cheese and roasted corn. The corn was delicious, but I had no idea it would be on the cob. At Bobby Q's, they roast it, slice it off the cob and serve it in a little bowl, which I prefer. The mac and cheese was an abomination for a place that claims to serve Southern food. I am not sure there was any real unprocessed cheese in it. I have had better from a Kraft Deluxe box.  DESSERT: I am glad we tried the dessert because the banana pudding was the True standout. I have never had banana pudding that has not been from a can, so the homemade version at Lucille's was a treat. It had some pieces of fresh banana and vanilla wafers tossed throughout the large serving (more than enough for 2). It was topped with real whipped cream (not Redi-Whip).  SERVICE: The service was quite good, attentive but not annoying. A manager stopped by our table toward the end, and Hubby made a comparison between Lucille's and Bobby Q's. The manager said that a few other managers had come over from Bobby's to Lucille's, and implied that something was amiss at Bobby's in the overall running of the place. Whatever that is, it is not overt, as Hubby and I never noticed that there was an issue with food quality or service at Bobby's. We decided that we'll give Lucille's 6 months to work out what we hope are some opening bugs, and we'll return to try again. In the meantime, you'll see us at Bobby's.",

Such a cute, southern, home-like, relaxing feel. Mismatched lamps FTW!! There's plenty of room on the inside and various different areas to sit in, which makes it interesting each time you visit.   I've never had slow or bad service here. The server my first time there not only was speedy and attentive but as I finished their version of an arnold palmer I was asked if I wanted to try a variation of it next. It was incredible. The food was also amazingly delicious. Their fried pickles are pretty authentic in my opinion. Our waitress this time was just as fantastic. She had a conversation with us, she was extremely knowledgeable and put up with our crazy table.   The barbeque always good. I have had better luck with the garlic mashed potatoes than the mashed sweet potatoes. As far as drinks the Muddy Waters (non-alcoholic) is fantastic as is a drink I had today that actually involved a sweet tea vodka. Unbelievable.  The only downside to Lucille's is that since it's mainly barbeque it has a limited menu.",

    "text": "My server was friendly but I was not in the mood for a lot of talk.   He wanted to explain everything since it was my first visit.  This was not my first rodeo in a Que restaurant so I didn't need to hear how long the meat was smoked \"longer than other places\".  First, I ordered a frozen strawberry Margarita - I sent it back because there was barely a strawberry taste.  I then ordered the Back Porch Strawberry Lemonade.  They need to add more strawberries to their strawberry drinks.  Next, came the biscuits with apple butter - great but it is not your traditional southern apple butter.  I had the 7oz brisket - it was served in one inch rectangles and not slices.  It was good but it still had fat.  It was easy to remove.  However, I could not taste the smoke.  Maybe it should be smoked much longer than other other places.  On the table there are three types of sauces - Memphis, original, and hot & spicy.  Except for the Memphis, the other too were watery but good.  The bake beans were delicious.  For the price I was expecting much more.  I will try and find a Que joint instead of a Que restaurant next time.",

We started off by ordering some fried pickles and they were a lot better than expected. Can't say the same for the worthless biscuits that they only gave us 2 of.   Well then after waiting a bit we got our food. But after a wave of servers went around trying to figure out what goes to what table. Is this their first shot at the restaurant business, is there no order to what food goes where.   Upon getting our food, seemed our expectations were just too high. It was good but nothing spectacular. The food must have sat under a heat lamp for some time, our gravy was dried, my meat was dried out.   All in all I would say go just a little further for a better place with better service at Famous Dave's. The service at Lucille's is just not on par. The servers are under trained and just can't handle the load.",

    "text": "The feel of Lucille's Smokehouse is a typical version of a Louisiana bayou shack on steroids as viewed through the eyes of a Wall Street investment banker. Lots of kitch, but charming all the same.  The good news is that the food is really terrific! Southern barbecue and home style side dishes that make your tastebuds stand up and take notice. The selection is amazing as well with items like Honey Roasted Peanut Slaw, Southern Braised Green Beans and Creamy  Cheese Grits to please even a grits-hater like myself.  The barbecue is wonderful, with full smokey flavor and a nice selection os sauce styles to add if you wish. And they even know how to make REAL southern Sweet Tea without making it taste like tea flavored syrup.  Where Lucille's fails is that they themselves like their food far too much. All of their barbecue offerings are nearly $5.00 more than any place else in town. A dinner bill that for us would be about $35.00 else where cost more than $50.00 at Lucille's.  Bottom line is if you like really good barbecue and don't care how much you pay, come to Lucille's. Your tummy will thank you, even if your wallet doesn't.  *******************************************************************************  Not 24 hours after posting this review I received an e-mail from Brad the owner at Lucille's agreeing with me that they were a touch expensive. Saying that it is due to the quality of their meats and the size of their portions. (Which by the way are massive! Our meals at Lucille's are always great but always generate lots of left-overs too! Yum!)   I understand these reasons completely of course and wanted to assure all of you Yelpers that while prices may be a bit higher, the food is very much worth it. We keep Lucille's set aside for more special dinning since we cannot afford to go here too often.  I was so impressed by Brad's candor in his e-mail that I am adjusting our rating of Lucille's up one star! Thanks for the note Brad.",

On this last time, I had the tri tip sandwich, and the two of us shared some fried pickles and spinach and cheese dip. We also each got a Hurricane, as suggested by our waitress, and ended the night with banana pudding and bread pudding.   Phew! So I had always wanted to try their tri-tip, but never wanting to be up for something messy I got it that night. After putting some bbq sauce on it, it was super tasty! My friend got the brisket, which he had to put half away when he first got it since it was so good and he wanted to take some home. The apps were also good, but I'd never had spin dip without artichokes, so I thought it was lacking.   Hurricanes - very good. Didn't realize we didn't get happy hour prices until we got the bill (we weren't seated at the bar), but it was well worth it.   And our deserts were tasty as well, though I think the small bread pudding was not very much for the price.",

I got the beef ribs, because that is what the hostess said was her favorite, and tri tip with greens.  I don't eat ribs often so was super happy that they were quite wonderful.  I liked the tri tip and was able to add my own sauce.  Greens were good, slightly salty for my taste.  Everything came out HOT and that is AWESOME!  Even my son's fries!  The sweet tea was NEVER the same.  Too much sugar once, not enough the next time.  The fact that they added mint made it all ok :)  We also had fried pickles for an app.  They were decent. We mostly ordered off the lunch menu and it was still a bit pricey.  The biscuits were AMAZING and your drinks are served in huge mason jars so they don't have to refill as much.  Always a plus.    The waitress was very nice.  All the staff we encountered were nice.    We enjoyed it and would go back...even though it's 40 miles away.",

There is also a weird gator head at the bar- it's that kind of place.   Other than that though the food was amazing. We started with fried okra and it was awesome- nice big pieces deep fried and served with a delicious spicy mustard sauce. Hubby enjoyed the novelty of iced tea served in mason jars. We both had bbq tri tip sandwiches which were very good and not at all greesy, and I loved the spicy bbq sauce. I was a bit disappointed with the braised greens- they were extremely salty and devoid of flavor. Also, the server was ok enough, he just lacked any kind of enthusiasm.  All in all it was a pretty good experience and we would try it again.",

Plenty of time normally. Service was great overall. Our waitresses name was Desert(spelling), she was very nice and did a great job. We watched multiple tables get their food before us. They were all seated after us. We ordered within 5 minutes of sitting. We ended up waiting about 30 more minutes and we had to leave before we could eat. We canceled the food and I was told the manager would be out to speak with me. So I then waited another ten minutes for the manager (Tiffany) to come out. At this point I almost walked out without paying for anything, but I didn't want to leave the waitress with that. The manager wasn't really the nicest about the situation. Wasn't very apologetic and offered to comp the dish(nothing else). I wasn't going to pay for the dish anyways but thanks. I was ready to pay for what we had consumed though. I left a tip for the waitress on my check. After realizing it the managers name was on the receipt as the waitress, so I'm hoping that she didn't get her tip because I would have left no tip at thay point. I have a pretty bitter taste about this place right now. We were almost 30 minutes late to where we were going which was a Rattlers football game. We ended up missing the entire firdt quarter.",

Let me start by saying, there are entirely toooooooo many items on the menu....like over a dozen appetizers alone to pick from. It's better to have a smaller menu with items that are exceptionally prepared than an superfluous menu with items that are just okay....especially from a modest place like this.    I selected the southern fried chicken because of another Yelpers recommendation and Im happy I did. Paying it forward and hoping someone else orders this too.  Very well seasoned, nice crispness and huge chicken breast (2 of them, actually). I realllly enjoyed my meal! My boyfriend order the beef tip trio and said it was \"okay\" . The baked beans were meh. I didn't like them at all, not sweet enough for me, but boyfriend did.   Would I recommend this place? Not to someone looking for REAL southern bbq that is tender and mouthwatering. For that, go to Little Miss BBQ. You won't regret it.",

Brisket burnt ends were good no complaints here. My boyfriends brisket were good but the macaroni was average nothing too special; fries were the worst, it was skinny like straw fries and super stale!

The issue is: Is there any meat on them? I've had great pork ribs from little Chinese restaurants with the juicy meat somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 inch high from the bone! The baby back and St. Louis pork ribs at Lucille's were more like 1/8 of an inch of meat or less over the bone...and not the least bit juicy.   This place is more of a tourist trap than a restaurant. If you ever paid over $100 for a meal for two people and walk away leaving food on your plate because it wasn't tasty enough to take with you, you know how I feel.",

It was a Friday night and they had happy hour...awesome! The service was friendly, but a little slow considering they weren't terribly busy. I had the cucumber marg and the husband had the strawberry lemonade alcoholic concoction. Mine was good, it was on the 'skinny' list (less than 200 calories) and it was quite large, so that got it some points, but it tasted pretty alcohol -y, so that was a little drawback. The husband's drink was dangerously good.... sweet and didn't taste like alcohol at all. Anyway, our bill was like 12$ for two huge drinks.... forget the other bars in Tempe Marketplace, the next time I'm over there, I'll head here.",

Food portions are HUGE so don't be shy about sharing a meal or even just an appetizer cuz DAH-YUM you get a lot of food. Love the drinks in mason jars too. Now that's the right way to drink sweet tea!  And the food was excellent. In fact, the biscuits and apple butter could easily be dessert...or a meal on their own. WOW. Super yum!   Our server Bethany was terrific. She kept our drinks full, was very personable, and had great suggestions without being intrusive. I will definitely be back--and am looking forward to those biscuits and apple butter very soon!",

The grits I had were more like a soup made with cornmeal, terrible.  My beef rib was so sickly sweet I really didn't enjoy it.  The pulled pork was a total nightmare, it came in a pool of liquid making me think that it was recooked in a liquid to warm it back up, it lacked flavor and really had no smoke taste.  The tri-tip was boring.  The sweet tea was more like tea flavored simple syrup.  The thing that was supposed to be a sugar covered biscuit was hard and crispy, not like any biscuit I've ever had  This place was completely underwhelming.  I make better bbq at home in my oven.  I can certainly buy better in a prepackaged super market.    Not to mention my lunch cost $20.  I will never eat here again",

They had a live blues band in the bar.  They sounded pretty good, but the bar is kinda small and then to add a band?!    I ordered the BBQ brisket salad with sweet tea and it came with biscuits.  Now the biscuits are kinda weird.  They look like a roll, crumble like a muffin, and taste like cake.  I KNOW!  Weird!  (see photos) I was expecting some real homemade southern biscuits.  And the apple butter was cinnamon butter NOT apple butter.  I was all confused, and we only ended up getting one basket (2 biscuits) cause our waitress was so busy and the other staff forgot us.  The salad was descent.  The size of it was huge.  The meat wasn't that tender.  Kinda disappointed with it.  My husband got a burger.  And said it was the best burger he ever had.     Desert was really good.......chocolate cake.  Yum!  I think its a good place to come with family or spouse.  Prices are normal for a BBQ place.  BUT I like my Tom's BBQ the best!!",

I had just mentioned to the person sitting next to me that I didn't really like the drink I just ordered, but someone who worked there heard me and went and got a manager to fix it. She came over and got me a new drink and it was an easy fix. But the fact that they were that attentive and wanted to make sure that you, as the customer, are happy made the experience so much better. I would absolutely go here again, not even for the food, but just because of the people who work there. Kudos to the management. They are obviously doing something right.",

The pulled pork is by far one of my more favorable sandwiches for BBQ. The pork itself has a great smoked flavor and they just pile it high. I usually pair it with the garlic mash or fries. The mac n cheese is alright, but depending on the day, could be a little soggy. My wife usually gets the shrimp po'boy. Good portion of fried shrimp with good slightly spicy flavor. But those biscuits though, and the apple butter, mmmm.  All the staff is super nice, friendly, and fast. I always appreciate the \"southern\" hospitality mentality. Saturdays we like to sit in the bar area. Usually there is a band playing some pretty good rock and blues. Anytime I have friends or family come visit, we always come here.",

    "text": "Lucille's is a mystery to me. It's a coin toss whether I will have a good or bad experience. I have gone and had wonderful service and warm tasty food, and I have gone and had nothing but bad news bears. Lucille's to me is not GREAT barbecue, it is ok, good for Arizona probably, but far from the greatness of most barbecue pits in Texas. I do like the restaurant itself, it is fun and inviting and the waiters each take care of all the guests, teamwork style, which USUALLY means great service, but again, the coin flip.        My recent trip with Kristen and my Mommy went well, we had a terrific server (can't remember his name!), our drinks remained filled and our food came out quickly. The food itself was, again, good, not great, nothing special. The best thing was the fried okra, the best I've had actually, the okra seemed very fresh and was so tasty. I had the southern fried chicken and it was fair, the chicken alone was a little bland, but nothing the peppery gravy couldn't cure, the skin also wouldn't stay on the chicken, which is simply a pet peeve of mine, no big deal. I had sweet potato fries and mac and cheese with it, which were both delicious and I would definitely recommend them as sides. Mom got the Texas style beef brisket and Kristen the pulled pork sandwich, which were both pretty good, but nothing I didn't feel like I couldn't get at any barbecue chain. We all chose the same sides and all enjoyed them very much.        If I'm in the area and want barbecue, I would come here again, but I certainly wouldn't travel for it, I would just pick the closest barbecue chain and be just as happy. So I'm not saying don't try Lucille's, I'm just saying flip your coin carefully.",

    "text": "My first impression of Lucille's when I walked towards it was \"chain restaurant\" and expected to see an Applebees like atmosphere.  Some of the memorabilia did resemble Applebees.  I did feel after I walked in that this place might actually look legit.  I like staring at interesting stuff on the wall while waiting for food or lulls in conversation with my co-eaters.  I must say that they hire very attractive waitstaff as our hostess was very typical of other females around the Tempe marketplace.....attractive!!    I looked through a large menu and decided to stick with my routine of going to the baby back ribs as a meter of how good a BBQ place is.  I then noticed they had different \"platters\" which offered more of a diverse plate.  I went with the \"porch platter\" which included a choice of three different ribs, BBQ chicken and a choice of meat along with your choice of two sides from an extensive list.  Baby back ribs and tri-trip were my choices alongside favorites garlic mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese.  For only $1.50 I added a Caesar salad to my meal.  The waiter offered strawberry lemonade as a good choice of beverage and I went with that.  The strawberry lemonade was sweet and refreshing.  Served in a good sized glass jar, it offered a throwback to days when lemonade tasted good and not just sugary.  Unfortunately, it was almost too good.  I immediately got a glass of water so as not to end up drinking 2 or 3 of the lemonades.  I was also on a budget and was looking at $35 as being my \"damage\" already including tip.    The salad was nothing exciting and I wasn't expecting anything exciting either for $1.50.  Typical side salad and I enjoyed it.  I'm sure ordering the full size salad might be a little more involved.  Maybe they might even throw an anchovy on it.  The platter mixed disappointment with delight.  The baby back ribs weren't as tender and juicy as I like.  It was hard to find the sections to cut with my knife so that I could pick them up and suck on those meat Popsicles.  They just sort of shredded off and i ended up eating ribs with a fork (a food sin!).  The tri-tip was good.  Seemed to be lacking that smoky flavor I'm used to when I BBQ my own...seemed more like a very tender steak.  I enjoyed it though and would recommend it.  The chicken was amazing.  So tender and juicy.  There wasn't any left to put in my take home container as I could not resist polishing it off immediately.    The mac and cheese wasn't anything special and I'd recommend not getting it for one of your sides.  The garlic mashed potatoes were better, but dry and not that creamy, garlicky taste you expect when you order them.  It was probably by design, as it contained chunks in it.    A great place for a family dinner or an outing with a buddy.  Not gourmet, but who wants that when you eat BBQ anyways.  The prices can add up on you quick so try not to order too much with your stomach...who am I kidding?  That's the best part!",

They are tender, meaty, and they give you huge portion sizes.  It is always fun to choose the different sauces on the table to create your own different tastes. For desert they have the yummiest bread pudding served with warm bourbon sauce.  So far, Lucilles is the best BBQ I have had in Arizona.

Porch chairs from the '40s, old-timey chandeliers and your great aunt's wallpaper. The only thing missing from this fake Old South experience is a whites-only drinking fountain. Guess the marketing folks thought that might be just a bit *too* authentic.  The other thing missing? Flavor. Sure, you heap on the sides and your fried green tomatoes are tasty, but this pulled pork is dry and boring, there's too much sugary crap in my cocktail and my biscuit is like a butter-covered rock.   Might I add: You mention \"St. Louis-style\" left and right, which I do believe is north of the Mason-Dixon line. So unless you want to argue the effects of the Missouri Compromise, I'm pretty sure St. Louis ain't part of the South you're trying reeeeeal hard to imitate. Even more baffling, your website says the original Lucille got all her recipes from her grandma in Greenville. So which is it?   It's neither. It's a corporate creation myth written by some copywriter in an office park in Thousand Oaks who was told to make the brand \"feel real.\"  And it does feel real. Real boring.",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to stop here yesterday for an early dinner and arrived around 5 PM. The place was pretty empty, so when the hostess asked us if we wanted a booth or table, I responded with: \"doesn't matter really, just a good spot.\"Well the spot she chose was a booth right next to their big smoker that was as hot as a furnace and radiating that heat big time! Coming in from 113 degrees, I knew we were never going to be able to sit there, so when the waiter came to the table I asked (very politely) if we could be moved. He said he would 'have to check with the front desk' and drifted away. Finally he came back and said we would have to move to a table and we said that's great! And of course he moved us right next to a table with a screaming baby. Payback I guess for asking.... Anyway, on to the food... I have to say that I was a little taken aback by the lack of any 'early bird specials' on food or beverages. In this economy even Flemings is doing a great happy hour! We ordered ribs (I had the baby back and my husband had the St. Louis) The waiter said we had 2 sides and I asked for a salad. He said that was not one of the choices, and it would be $1.75 more. OK. So I finally decided on the garlic mashed potatoes and the beans.  The biscuits they brought to start the meal were really good with the honey cinnamon butter. But only 2? Come on, be a little more generous. The salads arrived and they were pretty much the stock salad, nothing fabulous. Then the plates came, and I have to say the BBQ ribs were just OK. Nothing great, and kinda dry. And the sides were fine, but nothing to write home about.  I don't think I would have been so disappointed if it weren't for the fact that the meal (along with 2 large beers and NO dessert) was $80 before tip! Come on, that is ridiculous. We can eat at Joes or Daves for half that.  So....will I return? No, probably not. If I am going to spend $100 for dinner, I can go to the Keg just down the way a little and get a much better meal.",

    "text": "Ah, Lucille, Lucille...  I'm not southern. I've only driven through the south once and I'm no BBQ connoisseur. But I know okey-pokey food when I taste it. Here is another one of my stories where my first visit or two were better than the most recent. Don't chain restaurants know they have to keep up the high standards to have a lasting chain?...The first few visits, around the time of its opening, the meal was great! I found the catfish burger to be my favorite at the time, but still wish it had a deal of a bit more flavor or seasoning, its quite bland. I love the fried okra, they don't burn it like my mother, so I'm happy. Had fried green tomatoes for the first time ever here and they were pretty good. But when I ordered a po'boy during my last visit was even bland-er than the catfish burger and was mostly bread. And my friends I was dining with that afternoon didn't really care for their dishes either, especially with the cost.  On a happier note, who doesn't love being served a drink out of a mason jar! Who knows, maybe you'll like the place...don't knock it until you try it, and if its a sub-par experience for you too, I'm sorry your money was wasted.",

    "text": "It is with heavy heart I report that Lucille's, brand new to Phoenix, does not live up to its hype.   For shame this place could boast such fine decor, beautiful menus, and pleasant hospitable staff and then char the short ribs to the bone, inedible. If it wasn't for the thick sliced, juicy, fried green tomato appetizer I'd call the place a total bust. The flaky warm biscuits were nice with the honeyed sweet butter, but I know Bisquick when I taste it and I'm sure I've made these before at home. We had high hopes ordering up some blackened catfish, baby back ribs, beef brisket, chicken halves, greens, cheesy grits, garlic mashed potatoes, and a kids meal for the little one with fresh watermelon. First round was the wonderful mason jar drinks, Strawberry lemonade was sweet, fresh and thirst quenching, our muddy waters made with sweet tea and porch lemonade were good enough for three refills a piece. You'll understand however that the refills just had to keep comin' when I explain how the main course turned out.  First they served up the catfish. I could hardly see the fillet behind the nearly three cups of potatoes. When I did taste it I realized this wasn't a blackened catfish this was a water filled thin sliced sponge someone left in the charcoal pile. No wonder it was hidden by the taters. Unfortunately, they were a mass of stickiness with dried chives. I didn't find a hint of butter, or garlic for that matter. My partner is Irish through and through and was dismayed. We didn't even bother putting black pepper on them or finishing them at all. I was excited to try the cheesy grits though. My first fork pulled out a warm melting bite and so I offered some to the little one, with some greens to broaden her Northern palate. The greens were fine, but lacking in the advertised apple-wood smoked bacon. It was more like a chicken bouillon broth. She opted not to have more of either. When I went to have more grits the mixture had cooled and was more of a 4th grade science project than a good feeling.  Then came the meat platter. The chickens looked delectable and I quickly separated the meats from the bone. The dark meats were juicy, but the skin slipped off in a greasy way. The white meat was far too dry for my taste, but fortunately there were three bottled sauces we could mix together to dredge it through. Of course I believe that in a good BBQ the meat can stand on its own and you shouldn't have to dredge it in sauce to enjoy it. The brisket stood on its own. In fact it probably stood all by its lonesome out on a counter for an hour before it reached our table. Maybe cooking it in a bag instead of a dehydrator would have been a smarter method. Then came the hope of the evening, the lump of coal left to taste was apparently five baby back ribs. I had to saw them apart with a knife to free them from the creosote. The limited meat was not even worth trying to eat despite the three table sauces expertly blended to perfection waiting nearby. We tossed it back on the plate with the bones in disgust.  My daughter couldn't determine if her fries were fries or potato chips or onion straws, she decided she didn't really want them. The macaroni and cheese side was a small serving of elbow macaroni which seemed buttered lightly. Her standard is no name instant, the kind you used to buy 5 for a dollar and she was wondering where the cheese was. If I hadn't allowed the poor thing to eat the rest of the biscuits she would have gone home hungry. I will never understand how you can serve a watermelon that isn't juicy. The fruit is 90% water, but hers was an anemic example with seeds. For sure, the place had some fine appetizers and the desserts looked absolutely divine, but we were done before we even got to them and the check was already too high to consider salvaging the meal with a one pound apple pie slice. I cringed when they dropped off a comment card, but in the end I did the right thing and filled it out fair. When I want a great BBQ I think I'll be sticking to BobbyQ's where the St. Louis ribs are rubbed right and then bathed in a sauce you can't stop lickin' and where they send you home with beignets even if you don't order any, courtesy of the house.",

The service however is nothing to brag about. Waiters seem unattentive and I find myself having to ask other staff for things I need such as drink refills.

I love the Southern atmosphere and the porch area they have a bit past the bar. Oh, and their apple biscuits are amazing. With some whipped butter, they are basically a dessert. My only recommendation will be to make sure you have a wheelchair to be rolled out in since you'll be eating up some very hearty bbq!",

I didn't care for the ribs and brisket, but the barbecue chicken was by far one of the best barbecue chickens I've ever had. It was moist and went well with my adult lemonade.

I've had better at Famous Daves or Honey Bears.  I saw a man at a table near us, light up a vape and I didn't think smoking was allowed inside restaurants.

I understand this might not be one of their specialties so certainly can't judge them off of just one plate. Their mop sauce that came with brisket was average. However, their apple butter biscuits served before the meal were delicious.   We sat in the bar, didn't have great service. Granted it was 3pm on a Sunday afternoon so they probably were short staffed. Everyone was very friendly, just had a hard time flagging anyone down to order/get our check. Might be a better idea to get a table.   Very pricey- I am more than willing to pay for quality meat but that isn't what I had. We also had a Cajun shrimp salad. Shrimp was good, but was pretty much served on some iceberg lettuce. $50 tab in all for brisket plate, Cajun salad and 2 sweet teas.   I give the ambiance an A+, really cool set up.   Needless to say I will continue to search for great BBQ in the valley.",

Not enough fresh vegetables with the order. All in all, a lot of money wasted on food that wasn't eaten. Go to Chandler and eat at Rudy's. 1/2 the price with much much better food. I am pretty ticked off at the experience. Last but not least, we weren't even offered a refill on our drinks!",

That said, this place has average flavor. I couldn't really taste the smoke on my tri tip and not only that, I suspect my Tri tip was actually brisket. The burnt ends were ok and all of the meat was cooked well. A little more time in the smoker would have made both the flavor and the tenderness better. But it was fine. The spicy bbq sauce saved it all!  (I also liked the bbq mustard sauce!). The corn on the cob had zero flavor. But the biscuits were fab!  As were the fried okra!  The jambalaya we had was pretty good as well, but again, jambalaya is a spicy Cajun dish, this was not spicy.  Good. Just no spice.   Service was good. The place looked clean. And I'll be back.   Thanks.",

Ordered the 1/2 chicken plus 2 meat  meal and asked to get chicken breast instead of half the chicken, its never been a problem and the waitress said sure,,,totally.  took awhile to get our food and when it finally came it was seriously burnt, black almost like charcoal, i took one look and sent it back, even the waitress agreed it should not have been served, (then why bring it out) so another 15 min wait comes out over cooked again! Waitress says well its probably juicy on the inside hahaha are you kidding me? So I said fine, cut off the burnt and ate what was salvageable.  The we get our check, waitress says I took the chicken off YAY I thought but upon further review they actually charged me an $8.95 up charge for the breast, so I questioned the manager and was told that since they had to re make my chicken they needed to add it to my bill, but they took it off making it look like I got credit for crappy food and long wait!

One of the best I've ever seen with a larger group.  The decor is perfect, restaurant and bathrooms are very clean.  Drinks are great.  The way the place is organized breaks it up into smaller sections - so  you never feel like you're in a bit cafeteria.  We enjoyed the complementary biscuits - OMG - crispy on the outside and so soft inside.  With the cinnamon butter - perfect.  One has to be careful - you don't want to fill up on bread before dinner!  Appetizers - shared some Fried Green tomatoes - solid.  My favorite - a special \"Shrimp and Corn and Jalapeno\" fritters.  with the dipping sauce... FANTASTIC!  I had a brisket plate and roasted veggies, garlic mashed potatoes.  The Potatoes were average - I couldn't really taste the garlic, but it was good.  Wish they had been served with a butter or small bit of gravy - a little dry.  The veggies were very good.  A nice mix of various veggies and very colorful.  My meat was the brisket.  Very flavorful - and my favorite of the sauces served was the hot and spicey - but all were very good.  Next time I want to try the burnt ends... I wish they had a dinner version of that - not just the appetizer option.  Others near me enjoyed sandwiches and salads... everyone seemed pleased with their choices.  Lucille's is the real deal - not bad for a chain.",

I identified myself as a former cop and CCW license holder and asked about their sign and if management was serious about it.  She said they were very serious about it.

I shared that 96% of all mass shootings happened in \"gun free\" zones and unless they wanted to assume responsibility for my safety, I could not dine here anymore.  She thanked me and I left.

Arrived and sat in the enclosed outside area.   Our server was Travis. Nice but completely inattentive. Had to ask several times for refills, for extra dressing and yet when the server came around they would say they would bring that right out. We also informed that it was the hubby's birthday and no embarrassing act was performed.   When we received all of our food, sides and drinks they alone were amazing! Everything tasted fantastic sadly their staff can't keep the same amazing level of service. We traveled from North Glendale to here and it isn't worth it to return if this type of service is given   Family of 4. No appetizers. Cajun shrimp, grilled chicken salad, chicken fried steak dinner and a full rack of ribs=$130.00.",

The decor was outdated- I get they are going for that look but it was a bland version of outdated if that makes sense? (lol) I had a whiskey lemonade which was good but *extremely* sweet. They brought us biscuits while we waited and they were soo good but again- extremely sweet. I would have preferred them for dessert! My S.O. got pork ribs for an appetizer and he enjoyed it. We split brisket nachos which were \"eh\". I got BBQ shrimp that tasted like straight tomato paste and he got steak which he barely touched. Overall nothing was great - besides the biscuits. Service was decent. I don't see any point in returning.  Pros: okay service, large drink sizes, rib appetizer & biscuits were good  Cons: everything else tasted bad &/or unmemorable, overpriced",

My last 2 visits have been underwhelming and I probably won't return. On a previous visit, I had burnt ends and chicken. The burnt ends were the most rubbery beef I've ever had--just horrible and almost inedible. The chicken was very bland. I almost didn't go back after that visit, but thought I'd give them one more try. Every place can have a bad day, right? I went back today and ordered the tri-tip (which I've always loved). It was VERY dry and not particularly tasty--it was mediocre at best. Not sure what's changed, but seems like it's a different place than it used to be. On the plus side, the biscuits and butter are great, I've always liked the selection of iced teas (including peach and watermelon), and I've always received great service, but when the meats aren't particularly good anymore, and the price remains as high as it is, I can't justify a return to this place.",

    "text": "Good Service Strikes Back!  Let me start by addressing that I was contacted per my previous review and promptly had my issues address. Onward to my recent take out experience this evening:  For Me: 1/2 slab baby back ribs Sides: BBQ Beans and Mixed Vegetables  For Partner: BBQ Shrimp Dish  Sides: Cheesy Grits and Greens  Man what a comeback. I thoroughly enjoyed the ribs, did not finish them all since I already ate one the complimentary warm biscuits. I did find them to be tender, juicy, and well sauced. They still had the char on the outside and just mmm. Well worth the calories. A nice compliment were the beans, they come in a flavorful juice/stew. So they definitely need to be eaten with a spoon to scoop up. The flavor was on point, both sweet and spicy. I would order these again! The mixed vegetables were not really anything to write home about. I think they should be more accurately labeled as carrots and zucchini instead of mixed vegetables which makes me think at least a variety of three. There is not much in the way of seasoning on them but they definitely taste fresh, you can tell immediately by the smell. Not bad but not something I would order as a side again, probably do corn over this.   I had a taste of everything on my girlfriend's plate. I have lived the majority of my life in New Orleans and have a low bar of expectations when it comes to southern food made in Arizona. The bbq shrimp had notes of Louisiana bbq shrimp in the spices and seasoning but the composition being a red sauce, rather than the normal butter sauce, did not serve it well. The shrimp were juicy and plump. Cheesy grits had a nice consistency and were not overpowering in cheese flavor, something that tends to happen in other locations more often than you think. I found them to be pleasant pairing to the shrimp. The greens had a nice kick to them and were descent in their cook. These two sides come standard with the BBQ shrimp and I am not sure why the greens were added, since you have thin juice to pair with the thick sauce of the shrimp. I would recommend a different side for the dish but by themselves they are worth getting.   Something to note:  While waiting for the food I had a pleasant conversation with the manager and staff. All of whom, carried an excellent attitude and added to a friendly atmosphere.   I will be back.",

LETS TALK FOOD In my multiple visits to Lucilles, I've had -Beef brisket: Tender. Juicy. Flavorfull. -Mac and cheese: creamy and delicious. -Fried chicken: to die for. So crunchy and flavorful! -Garlic mashed potatoes: creamy and delicious -Original lemonade: just the right amount of tartness and sweetness -Sweet tea: It is sweet the way it is supposed to be! I also like how they garnish with mint leaves.  The only thing I didn't like, I apologize to those who like them, was their biscuits and corn bread. The biscuits were stale and the corn bread is too spongy and dense. I am not a fan of those textures.",

I literally had to drink water with every bite. the flavor was good but u have to chug water to get the cardboard like texture down your throat. Its just basically tasted like it was sitting in a bin all day and put on a roll.   2 stars because the sweet potato fries were amazing.  I dont think i would have been so disappointed if it didnt cost so much but when ur paying 15 dollars for roughly 5 ounces of DRY brisket its annoying really, you feel ripped off and feel like they just dont care about the quality of the food that theyre putting out.  I love good food and dont mind paying for it. But this was not good food.  Ill never come back here unfortunately... if you are rich and dont mind paying high prices for low tier food this place is for u. If not stick to a 5 dollar footlongs.  Management needs to do some quality control with their meats.. tastes like it was days old. Please fix this",

    "text": "Not a bad place all in all. I have been to this BBQ joint two times and both were consistent. Now don't expect to get a small business feel with a 30 year pit master's flavor/texture/style and over quality at the helm of  the BBQ served, but all this considering, this place does have some charm for a \"chain\" style restaurant. The restaurant itself is cute (large), with a few different seating areas and styles, set up to look as if you were eating at a Southern style home (No not a plantation). I've sat in the bar, as well as in an area that resembled a kitchen of sorts (a little awkward for my taste). Anyhow, the service at the host stand is the one area that is severely lacking and overall sterile, they are mildly friendly as a result of it being their job. But that's the extent. The overall service (server/food runners) both times I have eaten there (once dinner once lunch) was extremely fast ...I mean almost disconcertingly so, but hey I was hungry I guess. The server was nice, and attentive...  My better half and I split their porch platter (I think that is what it was called) it came with three meats and two sides for almost $26. The potions would have been too much for one person (in my opinion), but for two it was large enough (there was no waste or take home), in fact there could have been more fries to be honest, they only gave you a handful and I think for what you get $26 is a bit much. Their pricing is high, a rack of ribs is anywhere from $20.95-25, isn't BBQ typically suppose to be relatively affordable (???) and the reason it is often cooked so long is so the tough less expensive cuts of meat become tender and have good taste??? Maybe I am just a Yankee and don't understand BBQ dynamics... Overall, The baby backs were pretty good, the chicken on the other hand is much better, and the pulled pork was, according to my spouse really good; however, on the air of caution if you are a BBQ master and from one of those states that prides itself on BBQ, maybe you'll have different opinions. I will say they have a large libation menu, and their commentary biscuits with honey butter are very good. But I would say this place is a little (slightly) too costly for the quality, but like I said the charm might suck you in, I'd suggest going with a large group (which I will do if I return to this place), you can make a lot of noise and enjoy the sounds of their live Louisiana style band that plays on Friday nights, Now they were good!",

The sugar biscuits and honey butter starts out the meal. I liked the lunch special combos although 13.00 is a bit pricey for what was given. I had the hot link and rib combo, which consists of a hot link, three ribs, one side and a slice of watermelon. I thought the portion was good but I wished I had only got the ribs (baby back). There are three sauces (Memphis, Original, and Hot/Spicy) on the table. The Memphis is tangy like a Heinz 57 steak sauce.The service was good and attentive. The sweet tea was not like the best I've had in Texas but still nice to see it offered. Although I have had better BBQ in Kansas City, MO., the ribs will have me coming back to Lucille's for sure.",

We ordered one of the Ribs combo's & before we could get started with eating, a man pushes a cart load of raw bloody meat & parks it right in front of us!!! This was most unexpected for us since I had no prior warning about this. Apparently we were seated in front of their large barbque grill & had to witness this unpleasant sight. To me, this was more than I could take - looks like carnage! I have stopped eating meat since.   The hostess was most apologetic but what beats me is.. when you are ready to be seated, they ask if you prefer the outdoors, an indoor booth or  a regular table. But nobody asked us if we are ready to sit near the grill where they showcase large quantities of raw meat enough to feed a small country! I have requested them to be kind enough to warn their customers - particularly the new one's that may not be well informed about this practice.",

They are not spicy like our favorite Tampa BBQ place, but they were still excellent. I can't wait to go back and try their desserts. After our truly massive meal sizes, I could not have eaten another bite. Our server actualy thanked us for coming in, and shook our hands before we left. It was an overall great experience. Our only critisims were that okra should be a side, a buttermilk biscuit would be a good addition, and I'd love to order gumbo as a soup .",

Lucille's prices their BBQ on the same level of a Wood Ranch so I was expecting high quality meat, sides, and everything else.  Instead, the end product was far far far lower than Famous Dave's (though a dinner at Dave's would have been 30% cheaper for two, and better).  If Lucille's was in Mesa Riverview and not the always busy Tempe Marketplace, it would be out of business.    First the sides:  The beans were fairly bland (and almost cold), shoestring fries were decent, Mac N Cheese extremely subpar.  I had the Beef Brisket sandwich, fiance had the tri tip sandwich.  The brisket tasted like Jerkey.  Worse then jerkey.  I was expecting some tender meat (as brisket should be) not this garbage I could barely bite into.  The tri-tip was good enough.    This place was so just so... ugh.  For one of the more expensive casual BBQ places in town, it is easily one of the worst.",

Many people try to compare the two but they are different.  Some people just don't like smoked meat & some go in looking for BBQ and they will probably be disappointed.  If you like slow smoked meat you will be happy here. Also, if you truly like smoked meat, you already know to get the meat DRY, not WET.  The individual decides on how much if any sauce to put on.  Try their beef ribs(dry) if you like ribs.  Pork ribs just don't smoke as good in my opinion. I've been here 5 or so times and have never had anything dry, of course we go at lunch time so maybe its just fresher than at dinner (?)",

    "text": "The most fantastically average barbecue in the Valley is at Lucille's.  It started out promising: they brew their own beer! Yes please! But like everything else we ordered that night, flavor was lacking. Like a similar chain restaurant that rhymes with \"Blame Bumper\", there's plenty of everything, but nothing you'd describe as \"delicious\". Nothing you remember, nothing you crave.  The high notes were the deep-fried pickles, the hot and spicy sauce and the banana pudding. As many, many others pointed out, the meat was dry.  I really hate writing this sentence, because our server was an absolute sweetheart -- but if you take a customer's drink away to refill it, it needs to come back to the customer within a minute. My server forgot my refill and I was left without anything to drink while my mouth was on fire from the hot and spicy sauce. I know it's all \"teamwork service\", but I couldn't find anyone to help me with this during my entire main course.  Here is how Lucille's can improve:  1. More servers. If you spend money on just one thing, make it more servers. They were stretched thin.  2. Better ingredients. If you're going to invest in an enormous indoor smoker (and yes, folks, they use real wood, I watched them stoke it) then invest in some quality meat.  3. Smaller portions of better food wouldn't disappoint me. There are only one or two places with really outstanding barbecue in the Phoenix area, plenty of room to compete on quality.",

I put the original BBQ sauce (which was so watery and thin - also very tasteless)  on it, still needed flavor so I added alittle more spicier sauce and it was better.  The side of fries (shoestring) potatoes was not hot at all, barely warm but just OK.  I probably would try this again to see if I had a better experience. Service was SLOW, but good. Prices alittle on the high side for what you get, but pretty comparable.",

    "text": "The outside appearance of Lucille's is certainly appealing and we love BBQ.  Thus, our decision for a late lunch.  The place had a few full tables but it definitely was not very busy at all.  We were promptly seated but waited what seemed like forever for a waiter to appear for our drink orders.   Then, it took forever again until he showed up for our order.  We were just getting ready to leave money for the drinks on the table when he finally strolled over.  Needless to say .... service was awful.  We love barbecue.  Since we lived in Texas for many years, we know what Texas barbecue is.  It's not Lucille's barbecue.  My husband ordered the Texas BBQ sandwich.  It was too spicy.  He didn't eat it.  I had the 1/4 BBQ chicken and baby back ribs luncheon special.  It must have been an awful small chicken.  The chicken wasn't thoroughly cooked and the ribs weren't cooked long enough to come off the bone.  You would normally think a waiter would ask how you liked the meal especially when the plates are taken back nearly full --- not so.    If you want better barbecue, I would suggest a trip across the parking lot to Dave's or to Joe's BBQ.  Hands down those two places are not only better but they are a lot cheaper.",

    "text": "Was shopping around Tempe Market place and felt a craving for some good food. Low and behold we turn the corner and there is an BBQ plave that looks like it is inside a old train boxcar. We decided that this looked like a great authentic plave to grab a quick bite. The decor is fashioned from old school props wiyh mismatched chairs and tables. Not sure if i liked it or just garage sale junk they found. Our waitress comes over and asked it we ate there before. We say no and she explains the menu to us. She said the meat is slow roast everyday in house and flavorful. Looking at the prices we were a bit shocked especially for a lunch menu. $14 for a pulled pork sandwich and thats the cheapest thing on the menu. It came with 1 side and we both got garlic mashed potatoes.  Overlooked the price figuring the quality meat should be worth it.  Our drinks came in huge mason jars. The sweet tea was ok but I'be had better. The lemonade was way too sweet. Out comes our food about 20 mins later. The sauces were explained to us and i tried a couple of them but the werent good. The meat lacked flavor and was a small portion for the price. My bottom bun was already soggy and i jad to remove it. The potatoes were soo peppery that after one bite i couldnt eat it. I love garlic and this taste was definitely black pepper. I dont like to complain and rarely do but i really wanted a side and this was inedible. Our waitress was no where to be found and when she did come by my husband was almost done with his food.  I asked to have veggie instead cause i couldnt eat the potatoes...no problem she said she would switch it out. My husband then ordered corn bread cause he was done. Out comes his corn bread amd she said the veggies will be out shortly. The  cornbread was dry with really no flavor or sweetness. We finish and here comes the waitress with the veggies. She apologized and said the kitchen forgot about it. I asked for it to go since we were done. She brought it back in a box with our check. It came to almost $70 for a couple low quality soggy sandwiches and small sides. They double charged for the veggies and she said that shouldnt be on there and had to get a manager to take it off. Lowered our bill to about $60 not including tip.  I will not be back. Honestly the cheap chain restaurant Famous Daves is better. The price and quality dont match up here.",

Personally I would like to see them served with real apple butter but that's just a texture thing for me. We had a small order of wings with the mustard based BBQ sauce (can't remember the name) and they were REALLY tasty. The wings were still crunchy and the sauce was surprising in the best way.   I had the fried catfish...it was just ok. Too much batter and the fish and batter both needed salt. The portions are massive so I think if we go back we will most likely split something.    The staff was very attentive and friendly. The manager was a little surly but maybe she was having a bad day.   All in all - a good time was had by all!",

The baby back ribs were amazing (half rack $26) with 3 choices of bbq sauces on the table as well.  My chosen two sides were much more flavorful than I expected.  Several servers on the \"team\" as well as the manger checked in, but somehow managed to do it in a helpful, friendly way without being obtrusive. Perfectly timed, they gave us warm wet cloths just as we finished up. Then to top it off, brought cake and ice cream on the house because it was our anniversary! Without our asking for it!

    "text": "SO disappointed.  My husband and I went last night with our infant daughter (asleep in her carrier) and here is a rundown of how it went:  We were promptly greeted and asked by the hostess if we needed a carrier sling.  I declined and said I'd just tuck her carrier under the table by my leg.  The hostess then had a sub-hostess (?) come over and take us to our table.  She also asked if we needed a sling.  Again, I declined.  Minor annoyance.    What wasn't minor what that she took us over and seated us with 80% of the other patrons in the mostly empty place!!  We were almost all grouped into the same corner of the restaurant.  Nobody wants to go out to dinner and listen to all the conversations of everyone around them when there is room all over the restaurant.  Spread out your diners; give people some elbow room and privacy!  So then our waitress comes up and takes our drink order and that's when I saw that they are asking almost $5 for a mason jar full of strawberry lemonade.  I almost laughed out loud.  Seriously, who the hell thinks that $5 is a fair price for a mason jar of strawberry lemonade?   *raises eyebrow*  Uh huh, that's what I thought too.  Absurd!  So I ordered the 'bargain' $4 plain old lemonade.  (I'm definitely not a cheap ass, but I'm also not an idiot.)  The lemonade price actually made me think of the $5 milkshake scene from Pulp Fiction.  And if you don't know what the hell I'm talking about then stop reading this review right NOW and go rent get Pulp Fiction on streaming Netflix.      I'll wait for you to come back...  *drumming fingers*  Okay, done watching the movie?  That scene was good, right?  Okay, back to the review...  Anyway, the drinks were prompt and I'll just say it, \"That's a pretty fucking good lemonade. I don't know if it's worth five dollars but it's pretty fucking good.\"  So the waitress then asks if if we'd like an appetizer so we order a $4 'half order' (the full order was $7) of fried green tomatoes which, by the way, is also an OUTSTANDING movie.   What???  You've never seen that either??  *gasp*  Go on, I'll wait.  Again.  *taps foot*  Back?  Outstanding film!!  Amiright?  Back to the review.  Again.    The half order of fried green tomatoes was a complete fucking joke.  There were TWO (yes, I said 2) fried green tomatoes.  Not only was I flabbergasted at the utter lack of value for the $4 I just paid for that tiny plate with 2 pitiful tomato slices but they were impossibly hot, mushy, and utterly tasteless.  Even the shitty red pepper sauce they were swimming in was completely bland.  Unbelievable.  Should I even bother adding that it was delivered to our table by a different server who walked by us with two plates, looked confused, turned around muttered something under her breath that sounded like \"they ordered the wrong tomatoes\", put it down and walked away with the other plate; still looking utterly lost.  So when we ordered the 'World's Biggest Rip Off Of for an Appetizer', we also placed or dinner orders.  I asked for the BBQ Shrimp dinner ($20) and I substituted mashed potatoes for the cheesy grits (sounds yuck) and I decided to stick with the greens that it comes with originally.  My husband ordered the beef ribs and corn on the cob, I have no idea what that cost, but our final bill was almost $60, you sort that shit out because 'I can't math' very good.  Our food came right away which was good.  What was VERY bad was that my plate was utterly covered in some parsley and dry rub garnish that had been liberally sprinkled around (and over) the whole plate by someone I'm assuming must've had a grand mal seizure right as they were holding a handful of this stuff.  My food and plate was COVERED in this crap.  I scraped it off as best I could and easily came up with 1/4 of a cup of this sprinkled garbage all over everything.  It was awful.  Adding to that the greens were horrendous.  Bitter, cold and tasteless.  The shrimp were drowning in this ghastly BBQ sauce that was an unappetizing blend of too spicy and not quite BBQ'y sauce.  I can't put my finger on it, but I didn't care for it one bit.  So I sat there and choked down my $20 worth of shrimp and picked at my mashed red potatoes, which were the only thing decent on my plate.  I even complained to my waitress that my plate was covered in this nasty crap and had ruined my food all she could do was look at me and say \"Oh, I'm sorry.\"  Really that's it?  No offer to get the manager, or replace my food, anything?  Worthless.  In comparison the husband's food looked pretty good, as I looked on mournfully at his plate and looked back in disgust at mine.  I wanted to like this place, I really, really did.  The decor is fabulous and the place is uber cute, but the bizarre seating patterns, the ridiculous pricing for things like lemonade and 2 inedible FUCKING tomatoes, and the overzealous garnishments of inedible, chopped parsley and dry rub were too just much.",

The salads are all full of meat and cheese, but I found a garden burger!  Just had to ask for no cheese or mayo. They dress the greens on it with a balsamic dressing that was a little too heavy-handed, but overall the \"burger\" was good. It must be cooked in close proximity to meat, because it had a smoky grilled flavor.  I actually broke it apart to make sure it wasn't meat!  My side was sweet potato fries, which were a nice portion and not over cooked.  I dipped my burger in all three of their barbecue sauces... the spicy one is spicy!!  My favorite was the Memphis style.  It was tangy and seasoned well.  The original was pretty bland in my opinion, and a little too thick and goopy.   This is a pretty large restaurant and lives up to chain restaurant stereotypes... Pretty standard menu, odd decor, decent food, decent service.  Don't go here looking for culinary greatness, go here for decent barbecue, and you'll be fine.  ;-)",

We had their baby back ribs and the tri tip, garlic mash and Mac and cheese.  The meat was tender and tasty.  Loved the mash potatoes.  Nothing spectacular about the Mac and cheese... I'd do better with stovetop Kraft.  I also had their watermelon tea...ehhh.  Others ordered their pulled pork sandwich and a ribs plate.  You absolutely can't go wrong with the portions and prices at this place.    The live blues music was also nice on a Saturday night.  Nice country decor and service was really great.  Everyone there was very attentive and friendly.  I'd recommend this place and would come here again.",

That's a personal preference, not a knock on the food or service they deliver. Judge the place based on how close they meet the mark of what they're aiming for. As far as I'm concerned this is exactly the place I want to come to when I've got a craving for some bbq. The flavor is great, the sauces are good, the variety is all you could ask for and the portions leave me feeling stuffed. I got the front porch and each item was pleasing: Fall of the bone ribs, flavor packed sausage, juicy chicken (the dark meat anyway...white meat was a bit dry). I reserve the 5th star partly for the white meat, partly for the mediocre mac and cheese and partly because I have had better bbq sauce and find that I only really enjoy the \"original\" sauce out of the three offered. Other places have more sauce options and I like more of said options. Minor criticisms.",

We went for lunch on a Saturday only to find that you CAN'T get lunch on a Saturday, only dinner. We were interested in a sampler platter. They are almost double the lunch price on the dinner menu. When I asked the waitress about the lunch menu she said \"not on the weekend\". I told her that I didn't plan on spending $30 for a lunch plate and she just shrugged her shoulders and smiled - very rude. The biscuits she brought were hard. We switched to sandwiches due to the high cost of things on the dinner menu. The bun was very thick and hard and I kept tearing pieces off to avoid a mouth full of bread. The cole slaw was very dry and had no flavor at all. My husband said the BBQ beans were very spicy and he likes spicy food so they must've been really spicy. Also there were only 3 types of BBQ sauces to choose from. Most BBQ paces have a greater variety of sauces. Overall the place did NOT live up to its smell. I don't understand all the people waiting to get in there. I suggest Honey Bears BBQ. It's not far away, has zero atmosphere but GREAT BBQ at a reasonable price.",

I do however miss their flame roasted corn on the cob that they had a year or so ago.  They used to serve it differently, now its not as exciting, but hey...its just corn.

We stopped in for lunch while running an errand at Marketplace.  First, the lemonade.  I have a sweet tooth, but this was ridiculous.  Does the owner have stock in C&H?    It was very tasty once it had watered down by the end of my meal.  Next, biscuits.  Tasty and doubles as a hand grenade it you attempt to split it open.  Fried green tomatoes.  Not bad, but could have been called \"name that vegetable.\"  Kind of bland.  Potato salad.  I love a good potato salad.  I didn't have one yesterday.  Way too much dressing.  Maybe the same person that controls the sugar in the lemonade prepares the potato salad.  I shouldn't be able to eat just the potatoes and have enough dressing left in the bowl for another salad.  Finally, the BBQ.  I had the pulled pork sliders.  I made the mistake of assuming the pork was served dry as there was sauce on the table.  Wrong.  Okay, I can live with that.  On a positive note, the sauce was sweet and spicy and carmelized nicely.  But, it completely overpowered the meat.  What I really didn't like was the big globs of fat in every slider.  There's not much meat in a slider as it is.  Maybe that's why they call it a \"slider.\"  The fat just slides down your throat.   Since everyone has a different idea of what makes good BBQ, I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it.  I do highly suggest lunch rather than dinner as a starting point.  We payed half as much for me to determine I'm not interested in coming back.  What about dessert you ask? Just have the lemonade.",

I like BBQ as much as the next guy, but had just started my non-land animal diet. I found few appetizing options for myself. There were some seafood things, but nothing that stood out as possibly being great. So I broke my vow and went full bore into a plate filled with a few different cuts of cow. I had some brisket, tri-tip and beef ribs. The tri-tip and brisket were very tasty and tender. Totally worth it. The beef ribs were good, not great. A little too much fat and not enough meat. Big portions and it came with mac and cheese, which was good, and some garlic mashed. The potatoes were sort of industrialized, but tasty. I left extremely full as did everyone else a the table. Everyone had something different and everyone was satisfied.   Overall, not bad, but not great. In a bind at Tempe Marketplace this would be a respectable choice.",

My favorite food on the menu is the garden burger with fresh roasted veggies.  I've also enjoyed the mac and cheese, sliders, salads and more.  I also really like the fried green tomatoes.  I don't know where you can get those in Arizona.  The servers are usually a little slow, every time.  I''ve been served someone else's drink when asked for a refill.  (I had diet coke, they gave me someone else's iced tea.)  It takes them several mentions to get drinks or turn down the music.

    "text": "Wow.  A lot of comments on this place.  I didn't have quite the variety of eats that others did as I came here really only to sample the BBQ.    We ordered the meal for two, which is a special running perhaps for a limited time.  It came with 1/2 chicken, 8 ribs (St. Louis spares and Babys) and probably about 1/3 lb. of tri-tip.  Add to that a salad, 2 sides, and dessert.  All for $32.  From a value perspective it was a great deal.  I saw a review below that took issue to the reference to \"St. Louis\" style ribs.  Please inform yourself before you go all loco about this being a southern restaurant but St. Louis is north of the Mason-Dixon line.  FYI, St. Louis style spares typically refers to the cut of rib (you basically cut the riblets off the spare ribs), not how they are cooked or seasonings.  It would be like someone complaining about a New York strip steak being served in a French restaurant.    Ok, now that I've gotten that off my chest...  Biscuits, salad, and sides (which we got vegetables and the peanut slaw) all rated C+/B-.  While I understand the sides aren't the most typical BBQ side fixins, we didn't want to go too overboard.  Hey, they are on the menu, they should be better.  The salad was your typical crappy house salad.  The biscuits were hockey pucks save for the sweet butter, but I don't think I could have handled greasy biscuits anyways.  Ribs - they use hickory to smoke which I'm never a fan of for pork, and I don't know if they use an commercial electric smoker or a wood burning pit (I'm guessing the former), but overall they were above average.  The babys were much better than the spares.  The spares really lacked a smoke ring or good smoke flavor, but the babys were very tasty and moist.  Spares were pretty dry, which is unusual considering spares are typically fattier.  Perhaps they don't move them as fast and they are \"held\" warm longer as another reviewer speculated.  But the bonus for me was the meat wasn't \"falling off the bone\".  Anybody who knows anything about good BBQ knows this is a sign of overcooked mushy ribs.  The meat held on the bone and a good tug cleaned the meat mostly off.  Finally someone knows how to cook ribs and stick to their guns with the doneness.     The sauce kind of blew it for me.  Sooo sweet...tasted like a typical Kansas City style sauce.  I'll probably order them dry next time, and moreso to really get a sense of the flavor of the naked meat without the sauce killing the flavor.  I tasted the Memphis style sauce they had at the table, but other than the fact it was too thick, it had good Memphis tomatoey/vinegary flavor and lacked all of the sugar.  Overall I rate the ribs a B.  Chicken and tri-tip were really tasty.  The tri-tip was a tad dry, but certainly not enough to stop me from ordering it again.  I wouldn't call it a traditional Santa Maria-style tri-tip, but really good nonetheless.  Probably because it didn't have sauce coating it!  The hickory really complements beef much better.  The chicken was probably the highlight of the meal.  Both dark and white meat were cooked perfectly and were juicy.  The sauce was applied sufficiently so that it wasn't too sweet but added to the good flavor of the chicken.  I doubt they solely \"smoked\" the chicken, as doing so typically yields a rubbery skin, but they could have either cooked it over an open pit or did some sort of hybrid cooking method to give the skin a good texture while infusing some good smoke into the meat.  B+ for the tri-tip, A- for the chicken.  Finally, the desserts were mixed.  We ordered the peach cobbler and banana pudding.  The pudding was rich and thick and not too sweet, while the cobbler was pretty brutal.  They use dried peaches which were reconstituted, or at least that is what it tasted like.  It was a very commercial tasting cobbler.  C- for the cobbler, pudding was a B.  Overall service was good, and as mentioned good value.  I'm still going to cook my own ribs in my smoker and get a better product (and cheaper).  But for those days I don't feel like firing it up and want a fix, I'll go back for the chicken/tri-tip/baby backs.    All in all, I wasn't overwhelmed, but this restaurant will please most BBQ fans but will leave the True die-hards wanting more.  Ya can't have it all (well, at least in Phoenix).  If anyone feels differently, let me know.  And don't mention the unholy Honey Bears.",

We don't think any of the food we ordered was worth the price or anything special.  I had the brisket and it was dry unless I put sauce on it. The grits and sweet potato fries were the best part of my meal.  My husband had the tri tip and it was also dry. The macaroni and cheese side was so very bland. The biscuits were nothing special and the butter they served with them tasted funny. I liked they had a few craft beers on tap that I like and the live music in the lounge was nice.

More places need to be like this.  In fact, it reminds me of the Irvine Spectrum more or less in Orange County.  We decided on Lucille's given time and that it seemed to be a good Arizona restaurant.  The irony: we learned that eight (8) of the 10 locations were located in California. Go figure.  We looked at the menu; we looked at the decor:  Joe's Crab Shack is to seafood as Lucille's is to BBQ.  We ordered a appetizer sampler, rib sampler, tri-tip wedge salad, and a bbq chicken salad. While I enjoyed the tri-tip salad, T stated the bbq flavor was nonexistent on her chicken salad.  Go figure.  So what do you expect from a chain?  It does its job to feed you and overstimulate you with decor and witty, though nice, staff and good, live music.  Don't mind the food, but the atmosphere is entertaining.  I really don't mind such places if I'm going there for happy hour or a quick meal - but you really shouldn't expect too much, it's a \"chain.\"",

Sure, there are some clunkers on the menu, but I've probably eaten at one Lucille's or another more than a dozen times and I've rarely left unhappy. The up-side to being absolutely bombarded with food is that there's bound to be something good on the plate.   It's True, if you order the platters you will receive a plate the size of a small child, and weighing almost as much....makes you feel sorry for the waiters, who must get some serious bicep action. Yes, the short ribs suck, but the St Louis style are truly yummy. Burnt fries...? My daughter orders them every time and I've never seen it. The beans? Awesome. Don't know about the strawberry lemonade, but I go for the regular, and it's sweet but quite good. Pricey? Absolutely....not an every-week kind of place.  If I was a lightweight city kid or someone from suburbia, I'd have read the other reviews and thought \"gee, am I that clueless about BBQ?\" But no, I've lived in the south, I've traveled the US and much of the world...I do know good food. So while I don't want to bicker with my fellow Yelpsters (love y'all), I must agree to disagree with you on this one....Lucille's rawks. And BTW....if you plan on wandering around the Marketplace, eat dinner last, and take home the leftovers. (And for the record, I don't know anyone who's ever had room for dessert....)",

    "text": "*4.5 stars*  Whenever BBQ cravings hit, my husband and I go to Lucille's. We've been here a number of times and rarely do we have a bad experience. I would suggest getting here before you're absolutely starving because there's usually a big crowd and the wait runs from 20 min to an hour+ on weekends (obviously the busiest).   The restaurant is sectioned off into several rooms and has a down-home Southern vibe to it, from the old-timey framed photographs and wall art, to the screened \"porch\" with the shabby chic bench. Once seated, we start off with strawberry lemonade in huge glass mason jars and homemade biscuits with apple butter...so yummy!   We usually share the Combo Porch Platter (it has the right amount of food for 2 or 1 REALLY hungry person) with my husband getting the Baby Back Ribs, myself getting the BBQ Tri-Tips (the Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket are good too) and we split the half chicken. So delish!  Also, the nice thing about Lucille's is that there are 4-5 different BBQ sauces sitting on the table to choose from. The 2 sides we normally select are the mashed sweet potatoes and potato salad. I've sampled the BBQ beans, mac 'n' cheese, and the coleslaw and have found all to be sadly lacking.  We're almost always too stuffed to get dessert, but when we have ordered, we've gotten the Old-Fashioned Banana Pudding and the Peach Fruit Cobbler with vanilla ice cream. Skip the pudding...it was bland and tasteless. On the other hand, the peach fruit cobbler was heavenly! Sweet, flaky, warm crust with juicy peaches and cold vanilla bean ice cream...mmm-mmm good (drool)   So, with a check of around $35 (when sharing the Combo Porch Platter), scrumptious food and lemonade, and left-overs that warm up great at home...Lucille's is #1 in our book.",
