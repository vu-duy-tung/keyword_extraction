This the first time we have gone since they enlarged and maybe they bit off more than they can chew. We arrived for a 5:30 reservation and were promptly seated, brought menus, and order the $49 per person Valentine's day special. They brought our drinks and a little plate with condiments .... and then we sat and sat and sat. People near us who came after us were served. 45 minutes went by and my husband said something to the server and she apologized - we waited 10 more minutes and again complained to the server. She brought the manager who apologized, offered to comp us and said they had been slammed by take-out orders. Nice to know take-out comes before actual diners. They then brought the food which was all lukewarm so we asked it to be bagged up -- we then received a bill for $40 which we paid with a $10 tip -- yes we were comped some of it but it was a horrible dining experience and we will not be back and we will let our friends of which there are many that go there about our experience as well. There are plenty of other Indian restaurants to take our business to.",

The two stars I gave are for the atmosphere and the set up, but the food is a big thumbs dawn. No real authentic flavors and the taste is so bland. The price is also higher than all Indian Resturant's I know in the Phoenix area. I may be a little hard on them but I was truly looking forward to trying this place after I saw many good reviews but unfortunately I left very disappointed. May be people who gave higher reviews were impressed by the clean and  nice environment which I admit better than many other Indian Resturant's, though The food is way lagging behind. For me it was once and done and I wouldn't be going back.",

    "text": "Marigold Maison is one of the newer Indian \"foodie \" restaurants in the Phoenix area. Located in an area populated by strip malls and run of the mill fast food fare, Marigold Maison is elegantly presented from the outside and does not disappoint on the inside. If you go for dinner a reservation might be a good idea because the place fills up quickly, since it has a small to dining room. There is also a small outside patio area wine bar which is enclosed (smart idea on their part). If you go there for your favorite wine or beer after work, they have a pretty good list of libations that are paired perfectly with their delicious appetizers! Space is limited. The menu features many traditional Indian dishes, along with some inventive new takes on Indian for health conscious foodies. When we went there, the waiter was attentive although very busy. The food we ordered, came out faster than I expected and it was delicious, well presented, but not steaming hot. We were so stuffed I barely had room for my favorite dessert Galab Jamun! YUM.  A banquet room is also available but was not used at the time we went. We were nearly the first ones in at their 5pm opening but it filled to capacity by the time we left. The only drawback I thought was they only have iced Chai, and just \"hot tea\" in place of authentic Indian Chai tea made in a saucepan. Our tea water was barely lukewarm, and the whole concept of traditional hot Chai after a meal seemed lost in the Phoenix area's love of iced teas and coffees. All over though I really liked the food and atmosphere, which would have me returning to eat there again.",

We ordered the Lamb chops and a Chicken Saag Spinach. A great combo to share with two. They provided a complimentary papadum basket for a apparently standard 15 min wait to make the chops. The mint chutney was delicious, and who am I to complain about complimentary papadum?  The chef also went out of his way to make an off-the-menu-dish when I described a particular roti I have eaten elsewhere in the past. This was spectacular - even better than the naan I'd say and perfect for eating with the saag spinach.   Our waitress, Gena, was very friendly and helpful to select our dishes. The rest of the staff was courteous and attentive.   I'm really glad to find this gem in my neighborhood. The waitress spoke the absolutely truth when we initially arrived and discovered it was our first visit to the restaurant, saying \"You will definitely come back again\".",

We discovered this gem of a culinary experience from other yelp reviews.  :)  It's even better than my Indian family member's cooking (and her cooking is divine!)  My favorite by far is going at lunch for the seafood platter (they have a much better sounding name for it).  For $15 you get rice, soup, salad, naan, curry shrimp, coconut shrimp, and desert.  And each flavor is more enticing than the other.  I joked that the other customers might think it was weird to lick the bowls clean, but that's exactly what I wanted to do. Haa!  Be sure to get a reservation - especially at dinner - because seating is limited.  It's in an unassuming strip mall and you would never know what deliciousness awaits you if you didn't know it was there.  But you NEED to go.  Seriously.  Enjoy!",

Our server gave us excellent and honest suggestions on which items to order and how to structure our dinner (some street food options to start then sauced and tandoori entrees to follow). He was knowledgable about the menu and extremely attentive. All of our questions were answered and our water glasses remained filled.   I recently traveled to South India and I haven't seen Dosa done so True to the authentic way. The coconut chutney was exactly like I had it in India and the Dosa itself was perfectly cooked. I rarely have good shrimp so I was skeptical of the Tandoor shrimp but I was totally wrong. It was tender and teeming with flavor. This is the \"must-get\" item on the menu (another server admitted he eats it every night) We also ordered the Punjabi Bharta (a great vegetarian option) and the eggplant had a perfect smoky flavor to it. The Goan Vindaloo was spicy and very tasty.  This place is awesome and we will certainly be back to explore the rest of the menu.",

The chicken tikka masala had a bit more of a tomato base than I am used to but it was delicious. The korma had a little kick to it but I wouldn't really register it as spice. Overall, the flavor of everything was amazing. We also had a garlic naan and papadums. Everything tasted wonderful and the service was good. We will definitely be bringing all of our family and friends here.",

    "text": "This is a small but packed with people Indian restaurant. Both with indoor and outdoor seats, I like the vibe of it. They have lunch menus that has some limited dishes but they have some platters (called Thali) which includes combo of some dishes as taster. I tried Chicken Curry and my girlfriend tried Lamb Thali, both very well made except the salad and lentil soup were tasteless.  It was like salad didn't have any dressing and there was no salt in lentil soup. The waiter was very friendly. Gotta try their dinner menu too but so far my experience was positive.  Also if you like iced tea, you may be surprised with their version of ice tea. It is made in house by the chef, has clove and coriander in it which is very refreshing and different. Another surprise was that they charge for soda water which was unusual but waiter took it out of my bill.",

Our server - David was excellent,  he recommended and told us what were the popular dishes since this was our first time having Indian Food.   We started with the Masala Dosa, a potato and onion crepe which looked like a huge burrito which came with 2 different sauces which was exceptional. Also got the Gol  Guppa which was a whole wheat puff that you break a hole to stuff which was fun and tasty.   We ordered the following entrees - Lamb Chops, Tandoori Salmon and Classic Curry Chicken which all were excellent.   We tried the Garlic Naan and the Hot Chai Tea.  We were asked about dessert but we were so stuffed we could not eat another bite.  Was a great new adventure and everything was perfect.   Will recommend this restaurant and also be back.",

They have this great platter called \"Tour of India\" that allows you try out different dishes from various parts of India. The concept is really cool and also helps those of us who are indecisive when it comes to making a decision on what to eat, especially when there are so many great options! I love that they are able to accommodate those of use with food allergies. They have a lot of gluten free and vegetarian options.

They give you a paapad, 2 curries, one naan, a small bowl of rice and a sweet. I love the fact that the quantity fills me just about right and I leave feeling not heavy but content. The first time I ordered the Thali, the entrees (curries) were fantastic and the second time, one of them was alright.

Normally, I don't feel the need to write a review so fast, but I AM STILL THINKING ABOUT THIS AMAZING RESTAURANT   I found the Marigold on yelp, and my parents and I decided we would try it out tonight. Our waitress Gina was absolutely wonderful. She went into detail about the menu, telling us what was her favorites as well as the chef's and recommended different meat combinations.   Let me tell you, as a lover of Indian food, I have NEVER had better indian food in my life. The tandoori chicken came out perfectly moist where at most places it is dry. The Saag was so flavorful and had the perfect amount of spice. We also had the BIryani, which was so different and tasty. As an appetizer, order the seared eggplant it was OUTSTANDING!   However, besides the food, I was moved by just the general kindness of the staff at the Marigold. Gina was so kind, and was constantly checking on us to make sure we were enjoying our food. The chef came out while we were eating to see if we liked the food, and to tell us about his cooking. You can tell that he takes great pride in his work, and rightly so.  I will most definitely be returning when I am in the Scottsdale area!! Thank you Marigold for a wonderful dinner!",

    "text": "The Goan vindaloo , finally I've left a new restaurant in the Phoenix area happy that , no one tried to warn me about the heat and two wasreally the best rendition of this dish I've had in years that I didn't make myself.  Sour, spicy with a great texture that sticks to the naan and rice which, at least for me, is just the perfect size for an evening curry.  Add in Naan a cut above those poor thin uniform excuses that are the feature of most valley buffets  and a decent appetizer section  and I can no longer claim there's not a decent Indian restaurant within 10 miles of the house.  Again this is just based on one dish but that's really all I need. I really wanted to try a bunch of the appetizers but I could see $40 lunch occurring and  that just wasn't a today thing.  Great service, bit pricey for  solo lunch dining and the tables for 2 , tiny,wee bit cramped, though not relevant at the time I was there.   The lunch menu is too restrictive ,the leap from lunch price to dinner will limit how much I could spend, but don't get me wrong this dish is worth the price,  but 1/2 the serving and a 1/2 naan for $10-12 would hit the sweet spot and make this a regular rather than occasional thing.",

    "text": "I love Indian food. There, I said it. The problem? There just aren't that many great places here in Phoenix to get it. So when I saw a new Indian place open and get such rave reviews, I was excited. My mom and I decided to meet here for lunch last week. This place was a little hard to find, but it is on the NE corner of Tatum and Cactus (I went to like every other shopping center first... *palm to forehead*) and it faces cactus (by the Olive Garden sort of). When we entered, my first thought was, oh cute... my second thought was... this place is owned by Roka Akor's restaurant group... that's...weird. Anyway, the owner greeted us and that is when things started to get weird. The owner is a talker... he said so himself... and the things he talked about were a little off putting for a restaurant owner... he talked about politics... people walking by the restaurant.... his old chef who stole from him.... karma...you name the awkward conversation topic to have with a stranger, he probably talked about it. I would say this isn't advisable for a restaurant owner... it's not like we came here to hang out with him, we came here to eat.   Speaking of eating, my mom and I shared a Thali and an order of samosas. I was excited they had Thalis (not many places that I've been here do). The thali is like going to an Indian buffet when you are on a serious diet... you get to taste many items, but just a small amount of each. The Thali consists of 3 'main' dishes - you pick the protein for 2 of them and the third is a mixed veggie curry. They allowed us to mix the lamb vindaloo with the chicken masala (after a little nudging from me and agreeing to pay the higher price - 14$). The lamb was very good, tender, just the right amount of spice. The chicken was also tender, but kind of bland for Indian food.... I guess at dinner you can choose your spice level, but not the case at lunch. The veggies were alright... nothing great, nothing bad. It also came with salad (meh.. salad is salad), two scrawny pieces of plain naan (again... nothing special), rice, and a fried dough ball soaked in sweet syrup (I was kind of sad since reports on here said it used to come with rice pudding... I love rice pudding, the dough ball is just ok). The real star of our meal were the samosas... these things were hot, crispy, and well seasoned.   Will I be back? Eh, maybe if I were in the area, my mom really enjoyed it, but overall I thought it was just ok and far more expensive (and less delicious) than some of the lunch buffets out there.",

I ordered the Marigold Biryani with Lamb medium heat but it came what I would call mild.  The Tandoori here is different from other restaurants it is not colored red and not as much sauce but still good, it comes on a bed of onions and bell peppers \"Fajita\" style.  This place is pricey though.  We will definitely be going back.",

    "text": "Marigold Maison is a wonderful magical place.  A small little patch of heaven in an area that is far to commercialized, strip mall laden, and devoid of unique mom and pop operations.  There are quite a few options for Indian food in the valley and I am sure there are some that are as good as this wonderful establishment, but I haven't found them yet.  The staff is courteous and professional all while having an air of casual friendliness.  I found the manager (perhaps owner) to be very nice and obviously concerned with the dining experience and the quality of the food.  The restaurant has various specials and events such as their weekly Tuesday \"Date Night\" where you can get a three course meal and a bottle of wine for a very reasonable price.  Let us discuss the food... oh the food.  The tikka masala I had was the best I have had in phoenix.  It was euphoric and could not have been tastier.  For people who understand and love food, there is an ecstasy that certain foods can give you.  A natural high that takes you to a mental place where all the difficulties of the world fade away and all the is left is joy, peace, and deliciousness in your mouth.  I get this feeling with Thai food, Korean BBQ, and the tikka masala from Marigold Maison.  The garlic non was delicious (though our had one edge that was a little burned) and so good.  The rice didn't have saffron but that is understandable given the price range.  But these are small things; things that do nothing to tarnish the luster of excellence that permeates this establishment.  If you love Indian food, love a good deal, and are a hunter of that euphoric food experience, you owe it to yourself to try out Marigold Maison.  I would say that we need to do our best to keep this place in business but from the times I have eaten here they are always busy as it is =)  Maybe make a reservation before coming.",

The ambiance + kitchen is clean and organized (not something you find in most Indian restaurants), and the staff appears to be knowledgeable. This is, by no means, a fine dining establishment - although it tries to be one (not a bad thing). We had the Bhel (street food), Gol Gappas (street food), Matar Paneer, and Paneer Makhani with Garlic Naan & Spicy Naan. Food was excellent. Presentation was great. And the service was overly attentive.   This is undoubtedly our new go-to Indian restaurant. We are likely to use it more for take out rather than dine-in dinners - although, the dine-in experience was nothing short of great.",

    "text": "Marigold Maison is by far my favorite Indian Restaurant in the Valley and I have been to them all, no lie, unless one was hidden under the yelp radar.  What I enjoy most about this restaurant is the Chefs commitment to quality and innovation.  This is a Chef run, not mom and pop establishment like a majority of the Indian Restaurants we frequent.  Not to say that home grown traditional Indian food is not delish, but sometimes its nice to take it up a notch and add some elegant flair to the cuisine.  We attended the first mothers day brunch buffet they presented this year and it was amazing!  From soup to nuts they covered it all.  I was particularly enamored with the pork ribs they served.  We spoke with the chef who walked us through how he created the recipe, taking a traditional american BBQ staple and putting an Indian spin on it, genius.  On a more recent visit, I ordered a mango salad and asked to add chicken tika (not masala).  I rarely find a salad at an Indian restaurant that isn't just cucumber and onion.  This salad was so flavorful and full of surprises, mangoes, cashews, and other stuff I can't remember but all together made the most memorable salad I have had in quite a while. The Chef sent us some appetizers, chickpea batter dipped chicken strips, samosa and samosa chaat, loved by all guests in our party.  My father in law is recovering from bypass surgery so we asked for heart friendly suggestions. Once again the superstar chef came through with the suggestion of Tandoori Chicken which at the Marigold Maison is a cornish hen, Eggplant Bharta, and Biryani (small portion due to high carb content of course).  All dishes were excellent as usual.  Service was kind, attentive, and committed to ensuring we had everything we needed.  Atmosphere and ambience is simple and elegant, restaurant is a  clean and very attractive space. Bring back those ribs please!!!",

Yes there are vegan and vegetarian options, but chicken found it's way in one of the dishes. I was so upset but the manager went out of his way and he comped the whole meal. It was incredibly nice and I never would expect or seek that out but my first experience here was just awful. It's also the most expensive Indian food I have ever seen.",

We were very pleased with our platters and portions were more than adequate. Since I didn't order any additional food, I asked our server if I could take my leftovers home. He happily brought to-go containers. I overheard a customer tell the server he doesn't like lamb. Luke (the server) said he could double the chicken portion offered.

It wasn't busy yet so I didn't feel too bad. We settled on the Saag Spinach (custom dairy free) with lamb and the lamb kibaab. My husband also ordered the garlic naan. The Saag was delicious and the rice was perfectly cooked. Unfortunately, the kibaab was still pretty raw inside, so we had to send it back to cook some more. Once returned, it was perfect! Angela was so kind and really helpful and quick to get us what we needed. They had a busser who was really on his game and was always smiling when he approached the table.  All in all we likely will not return. My husband's comment was: Over priced and under seasoned for those of us custom to eating traditional spicier Indian cuisine.",

I came here for early lunch the other day, and really enjoyed my food here. They do get busy, I am glad I arrived here around 11:30am.  Around the peak lunch hour, they were completely full with some people in queue.  I tried their iced chai tea. It has a nice bold tea flavor to it, I really enjoyed it. I think I would have enjoyed more if it was hot.  (It was still hot outside so I wanted iced tea but next time I will order hot tea).   I had tandori shrimp. Shrimp is served still in the shell but they prepared nicely to eat to peel off. Shrimp had a very nice tandori oven cooked flavor to it, I enjoyed without any sauce as well as some of the sauce. My favorite was green one. They had four difference sauce, each was good.  Basmati rice was very good, I enjoyed it with red sauce. (I don't know what they are but tasty.  I asked for the name but I couldn't remember them).  For desert, I tried Rasmalai, Indian Cheesecake.  I never had Rasmalai before. In fact I never heard of the name before.  No pictures on the menu, I decided to try anyway as I like cheesecake.  Well, it was nothing like cheesecake I thought. I was actually quite taken back when I first saw it served. It ended up being quite good, very light, perfect way to end Indian meal. I thought it helped me settle my tummy.   I didn't get to try any of their curry. I am looking forward to my next visit here and try their curry.",

THhs was our second visit after returning from a three week visit to India.  Everything tasted a bit flat.  The Dal Makhani was not as smooth or spicy as that in country.  The Massala and Korma were watery and WAY under spiced.  The Tandoori chicken was a disaster:  Covered with a gooey something.  The accompanying onions were actual cooked limp, not raw as with authentic.  It is my firm conviction, based on 40 years experience eating all over the world, that ethnic restaurants, to retain authenticity, must have a large clientele of first generation natives. Otherwise, the food becomes dumbed down to American tastes. [That' s why, for example, it is almost impossible to find the  good German food in the US I experienced living in Germany for three years.]  I hope this is not happening to Marigold Maison.",

Spoke to the manager/owner who stood by his solid customer service and said he would get with Uber eats and make sure the whole meal was comped. Uber eats called us this morning saying they received a call from the restaurant regarding the delay and refund.  The Uber eats rep said we had to initiate a request online. I advised the young man why should we have to spend more time and effort on this when it wasn't our error. He said this is the only way to get the refund. Uber eats gets zero stars. Bad customer service.  Marigold would get five stars but they use a company like this so their poor service is imputed to them. Dump Uber eats.",

This is my first time ever having their food, but the reviews were mostly glowing.   I fired up my uber eats app and ordered 1 order of Seafood Thali and 1 order of Chicken Thali and a potato stuffed naan. What we didn't know is that the food would also come with salad, dessert, soup and plain naan. We were not only blown away with the generous portions, but the flavor is fantastic and rich, with sumptuous sauces and large prawns and tender white meat chicken. If the delivery is this great, I'm excited to go in-person soon!  10/10 would recommend this to anyone!",

Unfortunately, all of the desserts had nuts in them so I couldn't eat anything, but the chef made an exception and made us a crepe with chocolate and berries! That was so great of him and the staff!

As he was waiting for his food he did have an alcoholic drink even though he was clearly too drunk and legally should not have been served.  He was screaming across the restaurant asking Stephanie (the waitress) if she even \"put the order in\" he said that he will make \"a scene\" (in this day and age that could be anything including some really scary stuff) and yelled at a baby that was crying. He was making the entire restaurant uncomfortable but neither Stephanie nor a manager made any attempts to make the restaurant feel safe and welcoming to the dozen or so other customers that were equally annoyed and/or scared. The fact that he was served showed to me that the manager does not care about the law whatsoever.  After he was given his food he gave a hug to Stephanie and  then squeezed her ass cheeks right in the middle of the restaurant. I was trying to have a nice relaxing dinner with my husband and not view a woman waitress get sexually harassed at her work place! Again, the manager was apathetic and did not put an end to it.  When my husband asked Stephanie \"was that guy for real?\" she seemed really confused as if screaming across a restaurant, yelling at a baby, being really intoxicated that you caused a scene and squeezing the ass cheeks of an employee is normal. Stephanie said that he was \"an old friend\" and didn't even apologize.  Even though the food was good we will stick to the numerous indian restaurants in Tempe and elsewhere.   Oh and before we even got the chance to look at the menu we were asked if we ever had Indian food before. I'm pregnant and even my fetus had indian food IN INDIA. Heck probably asked cause I'm white cause she didn't ask the Indians if they ever had Indian food.",

I feel like these Suberbanites taste buds might be a little lacking here...This will definitely hit the spot when you're craving some naan bread and masala sauce, but the flavors are so average here that I probably won't be back...There has to be better/more authentic Indian food in North Scottsdale somewhere....Right?  Idk, because this place was jammed packed on a Friday night...With my baby boy and Hubby in tow we hit this place up to see what all the rage was about.  After waiting about 15-20 minutes for a table, we were seated.  There were 2 managers working who were running around frantic the whole time.  We specifically asked for a table bigger than a 2 seater because we had our baby boy asleep in his newborn carrier.  So we were seated at a nice 4 seat table (two tables pushed together).  My baby boy was sitting on the booth side with me and my Hubby on the aisle/chair side of the table...The table provided a barrier so baby boy wouldn't go toppling to the floor should anything happen...Can you believe, right before our food comes out frantic manager guy approaches us and says...Would you mind if I take this table...I looked at him like he was kidding, but he wasn't...I said, yea I mind, It's providing a barrier so my son's seat doesn't fall out of the booth! He backed away with a smile...I'm sorry, but what an idiot...Anyhow, once our food came, it took up both tables! Outside of that, service was pretty slow...But I guess it's understandable given how busy they were.  When the food finally came it was good because we were starving by then. Masala sauce was very average, naan was tasty but had some charred spots.  Our appetizer was above average.  Some type of Street fries fried with chickpea batter.  They were good! My Hubby had the chicken biryani and he said it was decent.  All in all, our Indian craving was satisfied, but we're still on the hunt for a True 5 star.",

It has been disappointing because I so love the flavors, textures, and smells of Indian cuisine.  I'm by no means an Indian cuisine expert. I know what I like. I liked Marigold Maison because of:  1) the smell when we walked in 2) the naan. Crispy on the outside, tender and chewy in the inside. Much of the naan I've sampled in Phoenix has disappointed. This naan was . 3) the chicken tikka masala was delicious. Velvety, rich sauce with proper spices and flavor. The chicken itself was moist and tender.  We also had a lamb saag dish that wasn't as good as I've had before. The saag ended up tasting almost a tad bitter. Flavor just wasn't as developed as other places I've tried.",

    "text": "We were really excited for our date night at Marigold Maison as several friends raved about the restaurant and the food and we were celebrating a special occasion. Reading reviews we saw the space was small and made a reservation in advance for Friday evening. When we arrived the place was swamped and the servers seemed really overwhelmed. After waiting a few minutes a table was set for us and we were excited to check out the menu.  We ordered popadums for an appetizer and two curry dishes to share for the entree. The popadums arrived and our server said she would be right back with the sauces. The sauces never arrived. We snacked patiently on the bread while waiting for the sauces as we watched the servers rush between tables and patrons line up outside waiting. Both tables on either side of us were visibly annoyed as they were waiting for their checks. Finally they got the attention of what looked to be a front of house manager and he checked them out. It wasn't until our main dishes arrived that the server noticed the sauces never came - she said she asked someone else to get them for us, but he forgot.  At that point the appetizer was a bust as we were ready for the entrees - lamb saag and chicken curry. We liked the saag, but the chicken in the curry was dry. My husband was surprised there was only one Indian beer on the menu - as a restaurant that claims it is a \"fine indian experience\", it seemed less authentic.  All in all, I have to say our experience was just \"meh\". The food was okay but not great, we have had better from other places in the valley. The service fell short and the team knew it. I'm empathetic, as I was a server and can understand how exhausting and stressful it is when a place is busy like that - but unfortunately those feelings transfer to the patrons.  We gave it a shot, but we won't be back.",

Their new bar and open front area are a great addition to their fantastic food.  I had lamb with butter sauce and it was likely the most tender, delicious lamb that I have had.  My girlfriend had chicken korma and it was equally delicious.  This was after we started with Sea Scallops which were huge and cooked to perfection.  Add to the amazing food, our very attentive waiter, Abe, and it was an unbelievable experience for our first time there.  Also, the main chef/owner came out to check on us and that was a very nice touch.   All of the help was very friendly and accommodating!   We will certainly be back many times!!!",

The server brought our meals and promised to bring sauce that goes with one of them but she never brought it.  We had a hard time getting her attention.  She had two tables of six, one table of four and our table of two.  She was obviously busy but we wished we had gotten the promised sauce.  At the end of the meal, I gave her $50 and a man (the host?  the manager?) brought my bill back with zero change.  I approached the server at her register and she brought the change.  But . . . it was short.  I asked her about it and she said we would talk to the man at the front (the host?  the manager?).  I asked him about it and he immediately backed away from the situation by saying, \"I just gave $50 to server.\"  (\"I'm just a bystander - not my job - don't ask me\" is what it sounded like to me.).   I finally got the right change.  Really, who needs all this hassle when you just stopped by for a simple late lunch?",

Jumped in our car and headed their way.  Restaurant is very clean, first thing my husband and I noticed. We were seated right away, not a lot of people were in the restaurant when we got there but by the time our meal was sent to our table every single table was occupied. It got BUSY and I know why, their food is AMAZING!  I ordered the chicken Tikka Marsala and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Chicken was so tender, basmati rice was cooked to perfection. We also ordered 2 orders of garlic naan, be-careful, they are ADDICTING!  My husband ordered the lamb chops and it was soooo tender an cooked perfectly. Like butter in your mouth, it just melted.  We will be back! Customer service was amazing, food was UNREAL and it was a perfect dinner out.  **Management** The only thing I noticed, despite a clean restaurant which is a plus in my book - have whoever cleans the tables check the chairs, there were crumbs left on both my husband and I's chair. No one wants to have to wipe down a chair before they eat at any restaurant. Also, one of your chairs is off balance, so I had to change seats. The table also was wobbly but our server took care of that for us right away.",

The place is very welcoming and the manager, Abe is extremely attentive and personable. The food is full of flavor and always hits the spot. Take recommendations from the manager and servers, you will never go wrong. I can't even pick a favorite cause everything is amazing. I do however, always start off with a shrimp or chicken Tikka. My daughter who is 12 and also a very picky eater, can't have enough of this place. Once we even ate there 3 days in a row. I highly recommend this location!",

Even though we were there ten minutes after they opened on a Wednesday the place filled quickly, good sign.  Our service was very good, efficiently quick which worked out as we has things to do  I ordered the chicken thali player and was delighted by some new dishes. Both the saag and masala were full of flavor and cooked well, the rice pudding was a nice sweet palate cleanser between the two of those dishes, the lentil soup was good, and the papadum was an awesome crunchy side to dip in the success along with the fresh naan. Hubby had the chicken tikka that for a man that can eat for two was slightly too much food! That's hard to find Bursting with the flavours of India we were both so happy with this discovery",

    "text": "In the middle is all I got for Marigold Maison. I had major high hopes when choosing a restaurant last week after a busy week of travel. We arrived about 820pm on a Friday night and were promptly sat. I noticed right off that the waitress didn't allow us any time to look at the drink menu before asking us what we would like; she tried to get our order as soon as she sat us while we had the menus in our faces. It always takes me a minute to peruse a menu and I truly don't like someone hovering while I do it. Add tired and the first opp for me and my husband to relax and enjoy a moment out together and that becomes a bit worse. Since she returned to hover in about a minute, I just ordered a white wine. She wanted to take our meal order then, to which we both chuckled, that was gonna be a few minutes , ( hint to back off for seven!).  We considered doing the Tour of India at 24pp , as it seemed a way to sample all things .. BUT also maybe way too much food! We started with the Lentil Crepe and Paneer Pakora. Both were tasty! We also wanted two Naan breads: Garlic and Mirchi... we could have done one! They are hand stretches and big! The Mirchi was spicy with actual sprinklings of chile on top. The garlic was divine! For dinner we did a Classic Curry with chicken and Malai Kofta , a vegetarian dish made of dumplings in a creamy sauce of saffron , almond and cashew. We loved each dish but the service was rushed and that was not okay. It was a Friday night and we didn't arrive late. The bill was brought to us while we were in the middle of enjoying our mains and no offer of another wine was made. We continued to ask for water. No offer of dessert and it left us feeling as though we made a mistake coming up to PV to try Marigold Maison out. The patio was still full of diners and I was confused by the rush. We paid; we left and decided to go else where to finish our Friday night date :)",

    "text": "Yes! I'm giving this 5 stars and here's why....Exceptional Service, Great Tasting Food, and Nice Atmosphere.  Just to show you how exceptional our service was, I've numbered every time someone attended to us during our time there.  My husband and I went here for our 15th wedding anniversary.  We always go to an Indian restaurant for our anniversary.  We usually have Indian food at an all-vegetarian Indian restaurant in Phoenix, but the food quality has become very inconsistent over the past year. So we searched online for a new restaurant and found Marigold Maison.  We were greeted immediately by (1) Mirnes Mehic, Director of Marketing, as soon as we walked in the door.  I know his name because he stopped by our table and chatted with us after our meal, talking about the restaurant, the chef, the food. He gave us his card.  We were in a corner table which was very cozy even though just about every table was filled.  The decor is lovely.    Shortly after we were seated another (2) gentleman came over to let us know that our waitress would be with us soon but he could get our drinks.  Our (3) waitress soon arrived, was very friendly and took our order.  Before we really noticed that our food seemed to be taking a little longer than would be expected, our waitress came to tell us it would be out soon and placed a basket of complimentary papadums on the table.  We are vegetarians so we had: Dal Makhani, Saag Paneer, Masala Dosa, Garlic Naan, and Mango Lassi.   The food was excellent!!  Saag Paneer was some of the best we've had.  Masala Dosa was LOADED with potato, Dal Makhani was very flavorful, and the Garlic Naan was fantastic.  We had the leftover Dal and Saag the next day and it was even tastier.   A little warning, the hot sauce that's on the tables is not for the faint of heart. HOT, HOT but very flavorful and you can buy a bottle to take home.  During our meal a (4) gentleman came over the refill our drinks and take away any used dishes.  Another (5) lady came over later to remove any more dishes we were finished with.  Our waitress stopped by often to check on us.  Mirnes Mehic stopped by the table and spoke with us.  He stopped by again later to present us with a complementary Mango Kulfi for our anniversary!  As if we hadn't already received enough excellent service, (6) The Chef stopped by our table!  He talked about the ingredients he puts in the foods like olive oil, as well as those he leaves out like ghee, heavy cream, and cashew giving the food a less 'heavy' feeling on the body.  Great Experience and Great Food to be had at Marigold Maison!",

There are other Indian restaurants in the valley nearby, and I would suggest trying different options to expand one's experiences.",

    "text": "Had heard some good things about Marigold Maison and decided to check it out on a Sunday evening.   We had a reservation at 6 and were able to get seated right as the place was about to get slammed. First thing you walk in, there is no host station and you have to just hope one of the staff members will approach you to get your table. Once we sat down it was roughly a 10-15 minute wait until we were greeted. They gave us our menus and then after about another 10 minutes they dropped off 2 waters for 3 people. Eventually everyone was able to get their own beverage and we ordered appetizers.   We started off with the Garlic Naan and Chicken Dip. The Garlic Nan was light and airy with a crisp finish. Really enjoyed it with the Chicken Dip. The dip itself was flavorful and the chicken was prepared nicely. It was a really good start to the meal from a food perspective.  For our entrees we had the Saag Spinach with shrimp, Chicken Curry and Chicken Tikka. The Saag Spinach had a nice spice to it and a velvety texture. It combined savory flavor with the spice and went well with the rice they provided. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, big and juicy. The naan also went well with this dish as the saag has a stew-like consistency.   Chicken Curry is one of the first dishes I picture when thinking about Indian food and we were not disappointed. This was also a very spicy dish as we requested but the spice did not overwhelm the other flavors. The chicken fit in perfectly and was also accompanied by rice. The dish as a whole was very impressive and the spice blend was second to none.   The Chicken Tikka is essentially a whole roasted chicken with dark and white meat. We got a side of hot sauce for the chicken which was laid upon a bed of sauteed vegetables. The hot sauce lived up to its name and was a great compliment to the chicken which was dusted in an array of spices. The chicken was juicy on the inside and had crispy skin. It is also a good sized portion.   The food was really good and it was ashame that the service was so bad. Drink refills were not done without multiple requests, and while they were busy, its not an excuse to just ignore your tables. But it wasn't reserved just for us, the table directly next to us did not see a server for at least 20 minutes and had to actually grab their own menus.   With the food being so good I was willing to overlook the bad service but things got even worse. Upon paying the bill, the server hovered over us as we attempted to sign the check. Right as we set the pen down after signing the check, we were told to leave. The quote I believe was \"we are really busy and need you to leave right now.\" It took me a moment to process that we were being kicked out of the restaurant due to their inability to handle good business. I grew up in the restaurant business and have held a variety of roles and had never seen nor heard of guests being told to leave the moment they sign the bill in order to get another table sat. At most we just wanted to take a moment to relax and finish our beverages but we obliged as I knew if I stayed any longer I would have had to say something about being treated like that.   I can forgive inattentiveness when a restaurant is busy, but blatant disrespect is another thing. Its a shame as the entire party enjoyed the food but we all agreed that that was our first and last visit to the Marigold Maison if you are kicked out of the restaurant the moment you pay your bill.   The two stars is out of respect to the efforts of the kitchen staff which were impressive.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying, I love Indian food.  I generally prefer lunch buffets because of all the variety.  However, I do know what I like so going out for Indian dinner is just fine, too.  My husband and our baby boy decided last minute to try out Marigold Maison. In terms of the food- it was ok.  The garlic naan was delicious. We had the paneer pakora for an appetizer- it was pretty good.  Most Indian restaurants that I have been to for dinner bring the condiments (tamarind, onion chutney, and mint chutney) on the side. The pakoras came with the sauces drizzled on the plate- an attempt to be fancy, I think. I prefer the sauces on the side because I like to eat them with the bread and my entree.  My entree, the vegetable korma, was ok- it was a little bland in comparison to other Indian restaurants.  My husband thought the lamb chops were really good.  We enjoy going out to eat and while great food is number one on the priority list for choosing restaurants, we also appreciate a nice ambiance, as well as excellent service.  I have been a waitress many times, so I tend to be more on the empathetic side of servers.  Tonight, I was digging deep and, really, the only thing I have nice to say is that the people working there seemed kind.  They were really terrible at time management and knowing how to take care of their tables, however.  We sat down on the patio and it took about 10-15 minutes to take our drink order. The table who sat down after us got their drinks, ordered an appetizer, and received their appetizer all before the 2nd waiter came to take care of us.  Waiter #1 was so flustered with what appeared to be a few tables, so he passed us on to Waiter #2.  We thought it was going to get better from there, but we were wrong.  It took our new waiter forever to bring us our check.  We never even got refills on water.  Bottom line- it's a small restaurant and we were forgotten about from the point of entry.  The food was just average, so due to the terrible service, we will not return.",

I will still be careful IF(that's a big if) I go there again and order a takeout. I would check the food before I leave.",

I believe in tipping well but at my discretion.   This was lot a huge party or a four star restaurant where one comes to accept that practice.    The menu clearly states that the tali plate come with naan but we were told 'not so for the vegan one!'    Two salads on the menu.  One for $14 with salad and one for $15 with shrimp. So I asked for the first one with shrimp.  Turned out to $17.   So the food is still good but these changes are not positive and change the regular visits of the past to history.",

Granted I did not give the Cactus Rd. buffet a shot thanks to Yelp Reviews, I did want to see what Marigold Maison was about. Great ambiance and open kitchen, Sunil the head chef is always welcoming. Andy was a great host that kept our kids thoroughly entertained the entire evening. My kids now say let's go eat at \"Andy's Place\", not a name change suggestion just pointing out the impression he made. And as parents know entertaining the kids while out to eat can be a challenge. Lentil cakes and my standard chicken tikka masala were our choice that evening and they were as good as ever. I would recommend trying it out and will go again to see if they can edge up to 5 stars like the Bombay Spice of yore...  A side note, as I was leaving the restaurant, a couple mentioned to Andy how their \"dinner was good but they miss the buffet\". Andy pointed out that reviews for the buffet were not favorable on Yelp, at which point the couple proceeded to say Yelp reviews are a fraud, bla bla bla...I couldn't bare listening to it and felt like I needed to stand up for Yelp as someone that really finds value from it. It's no fraud! You can quickly figure out which reviews are \"fraudulent\" and which are not, so I'm glad to see Bombay/Marigold Maison is in touch with reality and Yelp's value add to restaurant owners. Ok off my soapbox. Go to Marigold Maison and tell them a Yelper sent you!",

    "text": "Had an excellent experience there this past Sunday. We did a double-date with our friends who also brought their 2 year old daughter - and came for the all-you-can-eat Thali platter brunch. The restaurant: located in a strip mall, you can tell it's been converted from a prior establishment. The decor is very lively with bright colours, giving the place a \"fresh\" vibe. Very nice, and casual atmosphere, but not a very big dining room (make reservations first!). We showed up at opening and were immediately seated; it didn't take long for the rest of the tables to fill up. Our waiter was very informative and strived to make sure we knew what to expect out of the platters and answer any questions we had.  The food: We ordered both the regular and vegetarian platters, and both were really excellent. I won't go into details, but the platter is made up of small plates, and had about 4 entrees, a lentil soup, a quinoa salad, a rice pudding, a very large samosa and some naan bread. If we wanted, they would have refilled any of the items for us, but as it was, each platter was plenty of food for us.  At $15 per, this was excellent value - I promise you will not leave hungry.  I must add that I am a bit of an Indian food rookie.... and I loved every single item on the platter. There was not one item that I did not finish! The salad was fresh and zesty, the soup was nice and comforting as lentil soup should be, and the entrees were so delicious that I soaked up every single drop of the sauces with the naan bread.  The rest of our party was much more experienced in Indian cuisine than I am and also gave this place top marks for tasty food.   The waiter pointed out that the lunch is a bit toned-down when it comes to spiciness, which worked out perfectly for me. But for those that wanted more, the kitchen was able to accommodate differing tastes, if they are requested. I believe that is pretty standard at most Indian restaurants nowadays - they won't ambush you with a million scoville units, unless that's what you really want.   We will definitely go back for the Thali platters again.",

I only eat vegetarian dishes. This was the first time I ever eaten any Indian dish that turned out being sweet instead of being spicy. It had grapes it in for some reason and was very distracting and turned me off from the meal completely. Unfortunately, I ordered take out. So the entire meal which took over an hour to drive there and back turned into trash in a matter of minutes. My wife and I were very disappointed and had to warn the Yelp community.

Definitely recommend the masala dosa, which is slightly cooler than most of the other spicy food and is good to have around to temper your mouth-fire.  We also had the samosa chaat, lamb vindaloo (FIRE!!!), chicken biryani hyderabadi, and chaat masala.  Make sure you order naan - you'll need it to sop up the awesome curry sauces and to put on your burning tongue like an ice-pack.  For dessert, we had the kala jamun and mango kulfi, both of which were icy in sensation and great after the burning meal.  Song of Fire and Ice, anyone?  They also serve cocktails, which will shore up your courage and make it so you're slightly less apprehensive about eating what you know is going to be authentic Indian spiciness.  I'm not even sure of the ingredients of half of what we ate, but it was all delicious, and we devoured it.  I recommend coming here with friends as you can order family-style and try even more dishes.   This is now one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  We'll definitely return!",

Like spicy? The lamb vindaloo was three alarm in my mouth and very good. Glad we had a couple of orders of naan to cool off. Don't drink water with a mouth fire, tap it down with naan!

That's the history, but all that matters is the present.  Really great food.  Good service.  Real Tandoor oven.    Start with samosas, then get the lamb vindaloo and an order of naan.  You'll be a happy camper (and you'll have enough to take home for lunch tomorrow - but get another order of naan to take home!)  There's a really good 'sampler' on the lunch menu, give that a go sometime, too!",

On the 2nd visit we were informed no lamb keema dip but chicken dip, which was o.k and again the food was alright. Today we decided to try their lunch thali. I ordered for the lamb thali- the dishes were salty. They had run out of lentil soup so replaced it with dal makhani and my husband n friend ordered the chicken thali and they had run out of chicken too, so we had to wait for 15mins till they could whip up something. Well the chicken Masala tasted more like watery tomato gravy sweet and the chicken saag was o.k... we had placed a Togo order of chicken bowl which the server forgot to place, so we waited additional 10 mins... they were kind enough to not charge for 1 thali,due to the delay.. that shows good customer service but overall, I'm gonna say the food is 3.5. Some dishes can be a hit but most are a miss",

Upon entering we were greeted by a friendly hostess and invited to sit wherever we'd like. Water was filled immediately and the service was outstanding, friendly and warm.  The platter offers a sampling of a few items and is a good way to go if you are unfamiliar with Indian food. Both the platter and the chicken kati roll were outstanding.  The flavors are fresh, tasty without being over seasoned, and if you like spicy don't be afraid to get hot.  This native Arizonan went for medium and found little to no heat - but I didn't miss the spice, as all the flavors blended together so well.  It was a completely unexpected treat to have cuisine that tasted this good in town.  Would love to have this restaurant in N. Scottsdale.  Prices were completely reasonable and portion size was perfect.

It's great to see food like this, especially on a corner of cookie cutters and fast food. Each dish had unique flavors and presentations. I ordered the vegetable thali at $9 bucks and had enough leftover for a snack that night. Highly recommended chef driven indian food. Can't wait to come back.",

It makes it hard to enjoy your food in such an unwelcoming and unconfortable space.  Perhaps takeout is the only option for me with this restaurant.  It's a shame,  the original Bombay Spice on Tatum and Shea was such a nice spot.",

Twice we have ordered home delivery and both times they have failed to include dishes that we ordered and paid for. How a restaurant this inept can stay in business is beyond me. The food was also mediocre at best, but at least we expect to get what we paid for.  When we call to complain about the incomplete orders, their is a lack of enthusiasm and concern about correcting the incompetence involved.    Perhaps the owner should have stayed in the pharmaceutical business, since he obviously cannot run a restaurant enterprise. How hard is it to package what people order online and deliver it????",

They have mint, yogurt and hot sauce dips on the side that go perfectly with every dish, and everything just has so much flavor! Marigold is usually eaten in our house 1-2 a week!

I had the chicken Tikka masala, which is what I usually order at Indian restaurants. My wife ordered a new dish that I ended up liking a lot. Some chicken with a yellow sauce... Mahani, or Makhani. Not a big fan of their rice and bread. I asked for the garlic bread to not be burnt, and still it was a little burnt. The diet Coke was very flat and apparently they were not able to fix it. Be careful with the parking. The first row seems to be one way because of the parking spot layout, but I think it is a 2 way for traffic. Very weird.",

Hey, in my defense: I do not come here often, I do not know how busy they get... and I get OpenTable points when I make and show up for a reservation : )  I am not an expert on Indian food, I mostly get the tikka masala everywhere I go, and now thanks to a friendly but heavily perfumed lady at Tandoory Times, I know that chicken tikka does not have sauce, and the one I meant to order is chicken tikka masala.  I was a little adventurous for this time and ended up ordering one of the Thali lunch options, which is the round platter or tray with a few different dishes in small stainless steel containers. Honestly all of it was really good. I got 2 meats, rice, rice pudding, some sort of salad, plus garlic bread. I think I little soup too.  Overall I was very pleased with the food and the service. Only the tea had some sort of flavoring that I was not too crazy about. I was expecting plain tea.",

We tried their veggie samosas, papadum, and chicken tikka. Everything tasted yummy and the sauces were the perfect accompaniment to our food: mint chutney, yogurt and tamarind. For happy hour prices, the amount of food we got was filling.  Service was excellent as we got our order quickly and our water was filled frequently. I'd like to come back and try their lunch thali.

I liked how on the menu they say what is vegan, vegetarian, and/or gluten free. Could easily take my family here with their different dietary needs! I got daal which was red and black beans, it was amazing! Not spicy though, maybe would've liked a little bit of spice. My boyfriend got some kind of drink that tasted like ginger lemonade, it was so good. He also loved his chicken tikki masala, said he could drink the sauce it was so good!

They offer a full bar, outside patio seating and a tastefully decorated dining room.  The entree selection is extensive. Both as dinner portion and as small plates to share. The accompanying Jasmine rice is very nice, too. For the entree you have the choice of meats, tofu, or, vegetarian. Many of the entrees can be vegan also.

We were told that the kitchen fumbled the tickets but if you are the waiter then you should know.   Coming from a family that owned restaurants, when the restaurant does not run efficiently then the blame is clearly on the manager who needs to step up and fix this.

I was really hesitant to visit because I never wanted to relive that moment, but I wanted to try something new in the area and with the awesome reviews, how could I not?  We came in at 5:30p on a Saturday night. The restaurant wasn't packed yet but as continued our dining experience, the restaurant slowly started to get busier and busier. Service could be improved as we didn't get as much attention as we would like. You can tell we never have been and I was asking for recommendations. We decided on the Butter Shrimp appetizer, Tikka Masala Chicken and Garlic Naan. I also decided to order the Mango Lassi drink.   The Mango Lassi tasted like a milk smoothie - it was good, but I probably wouldn't order it again. The food though - was ridiculously amazing! I loved every bite - the crispy naan, the rice, the shrimp was flavorful, tender and succulent, and the chicken was delicious! Yelpers, you didn't lead me astray on this one!   Our bill was close to $50 with tip but well worth it when you enjoyed pretty much everything that was ordered. My advice is to get there early because it gets packed around 6p!",

The curries served that day were palak paneer( cottage cheese in spinach), kofta (vegetable dumplings in rich sauce) and chana masala (chickpeas gravy). The curries were very average, the samosa was well made and so was the naan bread. The biggest let down was the rice which was uncooked and had many grains which were old, dry and inedible. There was only one wait staff managing the whole place and so he did not even come to the table to check on us till it was time to pay for our meal.",

My personal favorite is the chicken tandoori with a side of yogurt sauce. If you're looking for the perfect way to end your meal; the mango Lassi is a delicious dessert to indulge in!  Why only 4 stars? You get what you pay for rings True. This place is very pricy, but If I could eat at only one restaurant for the rest of my life, this would be it.   Sadly, spending $30 for just one persons meal is a jaw dropper. Thus, I have given this place 4 starts for being overpriced and having rice be an additional side order.   HOWEVER, they have reasonably priced and a creative lunch menu that makes up for the very expensive dinner menu.. If only they could add the chicken tandoori to the lunch menu, I would be there everyday.",

I absolutely loved the food - when I heard same ownership as Roka, I knew we had to check it out, as Roka was always a favorite of mine when I lived I'm AZ. Don't expect anything like Roka though! This is a totally different concept, in the side of a strip mall, and much more casual.  I went with my bf and his family, we tried just about everything we could from a couple of the street food options to the lunch platter with chicken tikka and another chicken with a spinach curry (thali's?).  The chickpea dip with potatoes was super good and unique, the sauteed rice with vegetables and curry was fantastic as was the garlic naan.  I loved the quinoa salad on the lunch platter, it was a lot of food and fun to share between four of us. The chickpea flour battered chicken was a good option for very picky kids - although we loved the spicier options!   Our server was good about describing the preparations and we asked him to ask the chef to order for us (a good way to get to try the best items I think). We ended up with four dishes that I had never had before and I loved them all!  If I were local, I would def make it a fun lunch or date night spot.",

Starting off with wine, we sat down and tried not order the whole menu. Our waiter, Nick, suggested the Gol Guppa so we ordered that along with some Samosa Chaat, Bhel Puri, and Eggplant. Eggplant and Bhel Puri were great and the Samosa Chaat had a blast of flavors--- we LOVED the Gol Guppa.   For our entrees we got the Onion Naan Chicken Tikka and the Tandori Shrimp. Again, oh so yummy!!! I have never had Naan with onion before and after having this, I am not sure I ever will eat it any other way!! We ended up boxing up at least half of each dinner to take home. Guess we over did it little on the apps!  So even though we were pretty full, I really had to try the rice pudding. A friend of mine was there a week earlier and she could not stop talking about how amazing it was. My sister was a little apprehensive as she is not really a rice pudding kind of girl. However, it was a hit! I think she even ate more of it than I did.  So glad we stopped in! Can't wait to go again.",

We enjoyed another excellent meal. The Mango salad which we shared was delicious. I had the Tikka Marsala, chicken - fabulous mixture of spices. The lamb chops were cooked perfectly. We completed our meal with mango sorbet.  Service team very good.  Highly recommend. Next time we are in Phoenix area we will definitely eat here again.",

It's sizzling with freshness and a lot of flavor. For main course, I enjoyed the chicken tikka masala, dal tadka, and mattar paneer. All 3 are perfectly cooked with just the right amount of spices making the dish absolutely delicious.  Service is great! Pushpa and Abhrahim kill it when it comes to service. Very friendly and welcoming. Hats off to Chef Sunil!",

After hearing Marigold Maison has the same owner as Roka Akur (and the same investor as Nobuo at Teeter House), I had to try it.   I went here for the first time back in September or October and immediately became a regular. The food is outstanding! Every dish we've tried has been incredible...extremely fresh, flavorful and awesome quality of meat/seafood. The rice and naan are fantastic and we also love the tofu appetizer and chickpea \"ceviche\". My husband is a huge fan of the chicken curry - and I'm just a huge fan of all it all! We crave it almost nightly!   Andy, Abraham, Rohit, and Suneil are such gracious hosts and we always enjoy our conversation with them. Also, I'm not a big fan of leftovers, but this food tastes even better (if that's possible) the next day. Definitely try Marigold Maison! It's SO good!",

The curry was equally delicious and plentiful.  Service is excellent, attentive... but not to excess.  Highly recommend.  One appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 soft drinks.  $50 bucks.

No greeting, no water, no salt, no checking in to see how anything was, no sorry for the delay, nothing.

The food was SO good... great flavors, perfect textures and good portions.  The wait staff was very attentive, helpful and friendly - as was the Manager.

I will definitely give this place another chance",

Let's start by saying the service was fast and friendly. We had an awesome waitress named Pushpa who took great care of us.  I had the mango lassie and chicken tikka masala. The lassie was soooo smooth and delicious I could seriously go back just for it.  The chicken tikka was amazing too. I ordered it \"Indian Spicy\" and all though that wasn't really quite spicy enough for me, it still tasted delicious. Pushpa brought out some additional chili past to allow me to heat things up even more!!!  Oh! I almost forgot, we had the samosa's for an appetizer... WOW! so delicious.  My wife had chicken saag, she thought it tasted great as well.  Overall, I'd make the 30+ miles drive again just to come to this restaurant...",

Yum yum I'm writing this at 2 am and am super sad they're not open late night ._.also only sad part is they're double the price. :( @ naan & curry I got my chicken tikka masala, two naans, and rice for 13 bucks!

No dark corner booths with ripped vinyl in sight.   My only complaint is they are closed next week for their expansion.

    "text": "I learned about this place when they offered a \"lunch only\" Groupon.  When I looked them up I realized they were located at the same address Bombay Spice had recently relocated to in 2014, which means Bombay didn't even last a year.  I went there for lunch yesterday.  Both the waiter and General Manager were very nice and answered several questions.    I learned that Marigold is owned by the same corporation (JNK Concepts) that owned Bombay.  They have the same chef, but completely different food, menu and pricing.  JNK has multiple restaurants primarily in Phoenix and Chicago.  They also own Roka Akor and Nobuo here in the Phoenix area and still have one Bombay Spice in downtown Chicago.  The restaurant has been upgraded slightly.  You no longer order your food at the counter; they have wait staff.  The prices are considerably higher.  I told both the waiter and GM that I'd not been there before and wanted to be impressed, so asked them what they would suggest, indicating that I was thinking of ordering one of their Thali dishes.  They recommended that I try one of two other dishes which weren't on the lunch menu, but their dinner menu.  I seldom order Dosa because they are usually vegetarian, which I'm not, but I decided to give it a try.  In addition, I specifically wanted to taste their Naan.  There Dosa is called \"Masala Dosa\" which is a crepe filled with potato and onion.  It is served with two sides; Coconut Chutney (the larger bowl) and Sambar.  The crepe looked massive on the plate when it was served, however half of it was filled - the rest was just empty crepe.  The Coconut Chutney was very good, but I wished it had been spicier and there had been more of it.  The filling was OK, but not terrific, however you have to keep in mind, I'm not a vegetarian.  There was very little spice, and in my opinion, taste, in the filling.  There Naan bread was very good, but not the best I've had at some nearby Indian restaurants.  Their service was excellent and the GM was very helpful.  I left with mixed emotions.  The food was good, but I was not as blown away as others appear to be.  I'm sure they use good ingredients and it was well prepared, but to me lacked the kick and taste I would have preferred.  The killer was their prices; considerably higher than most Indian restaurants.    This Dosa and Naan came to $14.  I'm not a big eater, but the Dosa without the Naan would not have filled me.  Without a coupon I wouldn't go back and pay $14 for what I had.  It probably isn't fair to compare their prices with other places because they claim their meat and fish are a far better quality, and I haven't tried them, but I frequently get either a meat or seafood masala/curry, and Marigold's prices are 25-70% more.  Without additional coupons it is unlikely I'd return, based on price alone.  Their food to me wasn't \"that\" special.  I'm giving them a 3-star overall, but believe their food probably deserves a 4-star, although not for me based on what I had.",

However, Sharon, a member of management invited us back to give them a second try.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised at the turnaround. From the moment we walked in the door we were greeted by the friendly bartender and seated at a table with a great view of the artwork. Out came out drinks with a pair of samosas. I knew we'd made the right choice to return. Every item on our lunch platter was delicious and flavorful.   My favorite items were the chicken masala, samosas and lentil soup. Please try all of the chutneys and sauces! As someone who has lived in India for several months on a work assignment, I can be a naan snob. Marigold Maison's was buttery goodness perfect for absorbing all the flavors bestowed upon us.  Not only will I be back but I'll spread the word. Thank you again Sharon for the great service and lunch!",

We opted for in and were quickly seated and drink orders taken.  I always associate Indian food with Taj Mahal beer and we were able to start this meal off right with the perfect drink for a hot summer night! We ordered two of the chicken pakora appetizers and changed our minds when our waitress pointed out that the serving was generous. It was ample enough for the four of us. The naan (both plain and onion) was superb--perfect for sopping up sauces. I always order chicken korma when trying any new Indian restaurant. Because it is a favorite, I always have plenty of other establishments to compare it to. The dish arrived with a LOT of chicken in a delicious, creamy sauce. As stated on the menu, there were also pieces of fruit (possibly mango) in the sauce, which is something I had not experienced with this dish before. The portions and quality of all our meals were excellent. I admit to being a wimp and am not big on very spicy food, but I do like flavor. The general consensus was that the dishes were slightly on the bland side--not just in the level of spiciness (there was no heat) but just lacking the usual Indian spices. Service was attentive and, if we were going immediately home, we would have taken the leftovers. Would we go back again--yes!",

We tried both because variety is the spice of life!   The traditional platter consisted of shrimp tikka (grilled), lamb curry, chicken masala, and malai kofta (veggie cheese dumplings). The vegetarian platter consisted of chana masala (chickpea curry), saag paneer (spinach with cheese), malai kofta and paneer tikka (grilled cheese). Both platters also came with unlimited sides including: samosa, naan (you can also request garlic naan with no additional charge), papadum chips, basmati rice, lentil soup, quinoa salad, and rice pudding. The staff was incredibly attentive and kind. They were constantly refilling our dishes and water.  Everything was so delicious, very authentic and fresh! My favorite was the shrimp tikka, they definitely do not skimp on the shrimps, they're large and very succulent! I was also excited to learn that they would start having these all-you-can-eat platters every weekend!",

With him gone Saturday night and a few glasses of wine in me, I decided to order takeout with UberEats.   My order: samosas, chicken tikka, garlic naan, rice. My total: $38.83 ($2.99 delivery included).   The samosas were my favorite part of my order. When I ordered them, I was afraid they might get soggy on the ride to my house but they were still crisp and so flavorful. If you can't handle a lot of spices, I would advise to to not get these. If you enjoy a lot of flavor, these are a great appetizer for you.   The garlic naan didn't really taste much like garlic. The garlic is visible but the taste was bland. It was just okay.   I was not impressed with the chicken tikka and it is probably because I don't like anything burnt. There were parts of the chicken that were pretty dark and overcooked so I threw out some of it. The dish was a safe one for me and I was not a fan. Where was the flavor?  Maybe it's because I'm Asian but I enjoy eating flavorful dishes with rice. I noticed that my entree wouldn't come with rice but I really didn't want to whip any up myself. The cost for a side of rice: $4. I would say that is a little much - especially for the portion. I guess I was paying for the convenience.  I was a bit disappointed but was able to enjoy some of it. I felt like it was a bit overpriced as well.",

Dinner is more intimate to me with servings enough to share family style. Start off with the pakora and naan breads. Currently they are offering all-you-can-eat Thali platters!!!! This is great because you get to sample many of their great selections, especially the lamb masala and lamb vindaloo. Lamb Biriyani is another classic fave of mine. Vegan choices are also available but you know I couldn't speak on that. I discovered the mango lassi and can drink a pitcher of it; refreshing and the perfect accompaniment to the spicy dishes. The small wine selection offers plenty to pair with your dish choices. I love to finish off with the dessert and suggest asking for the ras malai. It's not on the menu but you'll love it! Take out is available and you can sit at the bar to check out the wonderful patrons that flock here.  I keep pretty great company when it comes to food. Check out the other reviewers, most of them are my friends. To give credit where it is due, I followed a dear friend and fellow Yelper Jonathan L.'s suggestion and embarked on a deeper appreciation for Indian food. You will find no better place to explore that than here. You know you can't venture too wrong if you bring a vegan Indian friend and they gush about the food right?!!",

When you walk in, I instantly noticed a couple things, the cleanliness of the restaurant and the smells, AMAZING smells coming from the open kitchen.  We were seated right away.   We started off with the garlic naan. It was good, I mean, really good, we ended up ordering another one. Best 3 bucks you can spend!  Wife got the Chicken Tikka Masala served with Basmati rice. It was rich and the chicken was tender, I loved it, yes, I ate some of her food. Don't worry, I shared mine with her.  I got the lamb chops. They were perfectly cooked. Tender, melt in your mouth deliciousness. It came with a mango salad, full of raisins, assorted nuts, it was awesome.   So stoked that we took a little drive to this restaurant. Service was on point, super clean restaurant, appreciated seeing the manager walk the restaurant and check out the tables to make sure everyone was o.k. Super awesome service.  WE WILL BE BACK!  Oh, they have Happy Hour (food) but you have to sit at the bar or patio for it. They do offer Happy Hour (just alcohol) if you're in the dining room.",

The interior was pleasantly decorated and we were seated quickly. The regular menu was great but the children's menu was not. All the items on the children's menu are a la carte and cost $5 each. If you order chicken, you get only chicken, no sides.   We ordered garlic naan and ended up with onion naan. My daughter doesn't eat onions. My daughter ordered lemonade and we got some kind of spiced lemonade. The server did not warn us that it would be a nontraditional lemonade. It cost $5 which took us by surprise, especially since she didn't like it.   My food was fantastic, but the service was mediocre at best. Some ethnic restaurants do an awesome job of introducing kids to new types of foods. This one did not. Bravo to the kitchen for the great food. Not a bad option for adults, but don't bring kids here, or at least don't bring kids who are new to Indian food.",

The waiter was ignoring us while the other two parties had drinks and appetizers brought to their table. As we're sitting there waiting for service, I see this guy dressed in black hurry into the restaurant (the patio is next to the entrance). A few minutes later, he comes out introduces himself as our waiter.   I'm guessing that our original waiter knew that he gave us horrible service and shuffled us off to the second waiter.  After we ate, we had to wait another 10 minutes for the bill. There was no offer for dessert or post-dinner drinks.  I will say that the food is good. My lamb chops were actually really good. Just keep an expectation for weak customer service.",

Upon telling him that we don't mind he replied that he only had one bus boy. I will never understand why Steven was so adamant about turning us away but Marigold Maison has lost a loyal customer. Steven should not deal with customers as he does not have a single customer service bone in his body.",

Pushpa made wonderful food suggestions as well as some great wine pairings. We ordered a feast, including gol guppa, mango salad, chicken tikka masala, lamb chops, lamb saag and garlic naan.  I've been here a couple more times since then and their wild-caught salmon tikka masala and masala dosa (Indian crepes) are to die for. Chef Sunil mentioned they are the hardest thing on their menu to make, but he loves sharing a piece of his culture. I've also stopped by for happy hour and they have an AMAZING happy hour.

The garlic is amazingly fresh, so you will thank me :)   Also, don't order through Yelp as they report an hour wait for everything, when popular items like Chicken Tikka are probably ready for you in 20 minutes.   The best way to share their Tikka or Tandoori is to get a nice bowl, put the rice in and pass around the entrees. Special tip, there's a Dickeys BBQ right next door with a Coca Cola Freestyle Machine, so you can get some great pop to quench your thirst.   Sometimes, I even get Dickeys Chicken and add it to the Masons Tikka... Amazing!",

The reason why I gave it 4 stores is because our server didn't seem very attentive to our table. She never smiled at us and never came and checked on us. There was another server who kept coming to refill our waters and asked us how everything was and she was super nice and more attentive to us than our actual sever!! All in all it was a great night with amazing food. Highly reccomend",

The service started off very friendly, but then became inattentive and almost annoyed - never filling water glasses; long random times between food - even though we asked to not delay as we had a young one with us.   I've had Indian food in many cities to compare.  This food was relatively bland.  The dosa was like a soft pancake stuffed with potatoes - not the thin crispy version that is more typical.  Lassi was OK, but only available in  mango version.   The saag paneer was relatively good. The chicken tikka masala was OK, but surprisingly little chicken for a $16 dish.   Wine selection was good. Overall, food is OK, jut not quite authentic Indian.  I would call this Indian-style.  There are not many Indian restaurants in the area.   So, this place is good for a nice meal if you're in no rush and don't mind getting Phoenix version of Indian.   The pricing is expensive for what it is.",

The butter shrimp was succulent accompanied by its chipotle cream sauce.  As entree, we ordered the spicy chicken korma and it was delightful. Our server Abraham brought us three different kinds of chutneys which were a nice finishing touch.  The service was spot on and very attentive.

So if they make this correction and I dont have extreme bloating after I would then recommend it.  Less processed ingredients to make it healthier and easier to digest!

    "text": "Majorly disappointed. I've had the luxury of spending a lot of time in India and absolutely love the food. While that doesn't make me an expert in Indian food, it makes me someone who really enjoys it. After moving to the area, finding an Indian restaurant was a top priority. Marigold Maison caught my attention because of the terrific reviews and the fact that they had two of my favorite dishes on the menu - masala dosa and aloo gobi.  I've been after my wife to try the place since we got here and she finally agreed to so I made us a reservation for Saturday night. We were seated at a two-top next to the wall around the kitchen. Not horrible, but a bit disappointing given we had made a reservation. We ordered glasses of wine and the masala dosa. When I travel to India, the masala dosa is my standard everyday breakfast. I absolutely adore them and couldn't wait for my wife to try it. The dosa served was thick - almost like a tortilla instead of the paper-thin crispy dosa I'm used to. The filling was bland and the whole thing looked like it was flattened. The highlight was the coconut chutney, but the dosa itself was not very good. To top it off, my wife's wine was flat. Clearly the bottle had been open for a while.  After the appetizer, we waited for literally 15 minutes (I looked at my phone) waiting for the entrees. This was while we watched the people who came in after us get their entrees. When the food finally arrived, it was a total letdown. The Chicken vindaloo contained dry, chewy chicken and the vindaloo's only flavor component was \"spicy\". The saag panner was probably the only highlight of the entire experience, and it gained that position by being average in a meal of below average. The aloo gobi, one of my favorite dishes, was flavorless, lacked potato (you know, the aloo in aloo gobi) and had diced tomato in it, which was a first.  The final slap in the face was a check for over $90 for a very sub-par meal and disappointing service  I really wish I had eaten in the place that the other reviewers seem to have eaten at. It sounds like a great place, but unfortunately that wasn't my experience. Super disappointed. I won't go back.",

We wanted to ensure we ordered a good variety in order to get a good feel for most flavors. The food itself is a 3 out of 5. The flavors were bland, and all three entrees had a similar curry base. If I was doing a blind test they would all taste the same to me. The rice was not fluffy and stuck together in large chunks. You can not choose spice levels. The dosa/crepe was not crispy like it should be, very soggy. I have had better Indian food in the valley this place isn't worth the hype. As far as service, I would rate it a 0 out of 5. I had reservations and two parties without one got seated before ours. The server forgot to give us plates, forgot to bring one of the drink orders, and forgot to bring out the appetizer. Several items we inquired about, he said were no longer on the menu?! What?! Was unapologetic and careless. I drove far to visit this location but definitely will not be planning a trip back. Mediocre at best.",

It is an attractive place with ample seating, however my concern is always the food--how good is it? We ordered chicken biryani and my old stand by, Chicken Vindaloo.  I figured if they do vindaloo sauce well, other sauces will be good too.  Maybe it's an assumption but I have found it to be True.  The chicken vindaloo was delicious with plenty of cooked potatoes which is signature to the dish.  I asked for a \"7\" on the spiciness scale and what I got was more of a 5 but my guess is that they are afraid of overdoing especially for people they don't know.   The chicken biryani was different than most we have experienced.  The mix of spices in that dish did not taste as good (to us) as the other biryani's we have had.  I would not order this again.  But I will tell you that they are super generous with their portions.   I noticed that they don't do the complementary papadum (lentil crackers) as most indian restaurants do.  Everything seems to be a la carte even the chutneys.   The service was lovely and attentive.   I would definitely go back for the vindaloo or to try out their lunch specials,",

The shrimp Tikka masala doesn't taste like anything we've ever had. The samosa Chaat has pico on it, and was served cold. I'm not sure why they put pico on it at all.

    "text": "Quick summary - Marigold Maison serves good to sometimes excellent Indian food, but the prices are a bit on the high side.  The restaurant is pleasant but not fancy and the servers do their job as well as you would expect in a neighborhood ethnic restaurant.  The menu is extensive and has a couple of items that you do not associate with Indian cooking, such as lamb chops and ribs.  However, it is pretty much the standard stuff, with the tikki malasa being a deserved standout.  The spinach with cheese dish, however, was overly minty and not quite so good.    The only real problem is that I don't want to spend $50 on two entrees and one Naan at an Indian restaurant, and so I will not be back.  That is more a problem for Marigold Maison that it is for me, however, as there are plenty of other choices.",

I ordered the makhani with paneer, a dish I've had many times in NYC, Phoenix, etc. The dish came out looking beautifully presented, but I immediately noticed that the sauce was yellow instead of the orange/red traditionally associated with makhani. I asked our server, who was very attentive, why tomato and seemingly any spice whatsoever had been left out of my makhani dish. Our server, not realizing that the first ingredient listed on the menu under makhani was \"tomato,\" said the dish didn't include tomato. The flavor was still interesting, but mostly tasted so bland that I would have thought it to be an Italian dish rather than Indian. The garlic naan, however, was DELICIOUS.",

Our server was pleasant but couldn't get any orders on time. We waited 45 mins before our thali came.   They have a choice of vegetarian thali and Meat thali, each comes with naan, 3 types of curries, samosa, rice, dal, salad and rice pudding. Chicken, lamb and malai kofta was good, rest was just ok.  When our food finally came, we asked for table settings 3 times but no luck. I finally got up from my seat to get some.   They advertise it as all you can eat however nothing gets refilled. We asked for naan that never came. Waited another 30 mins but no naan. My husband wanted refill on lamb and chicken but that never came. So we just asked for our check and left.",

The butter chicken was the only thing edible and the chicken was pregrilled sliced chicken!! Butter chicken is always made with tandoori chicken that is simmered in a butter tomato sauce and this was just so disappointing. The taste was just gross.   The saag paneer tasted so bad we couldn't even eat it.  Every person in my family has been here and I wish they had told me before I went because they all experienced similar dining experiences and would never go there again.  If you are looking for good Indian food, LOOK ELSEWHERE! Everything here is microwaved and served!",

The garlic naan was super fresh an delicious.  The chicken biriyani was average which was the only downside.  We also got regular lassi which was awesome as well. Seems like the ambience was a lot more open and brighter as well.  Would recommend marigold if your in the mood for some Indian food in Scottsdale.",

Unfortunately, the waiter took the food before we were able to put it into the container.  We informed the waiter and the manager came over.  Both appologized for the mistake.  Then the manager said they were making a fresh batch and would give us some.  We waited (no long and we were talking anyway).  He basically gave a full serving.  He was also very friendly.  Service like that is simply outstanding.  While, I rarely give five stars, I thought between the food and the service, they deserve it.  I would definitely recommend Marigold Maison.",

I know what indian food is.  The \"vindaloo\" here is NOT vindaloo, and whatever it is, it is not tasty.  The Biryani was even spicier than the \"vindaloo\" and, other than the extremely hot spices, rather tasteless.  Finally, the \"curry\" was unrecognizable.  Much like the \"vindaloo.\" I am not sure what the \"curry\" was, but it was unlike any curryI have ever eaten and not tasty.    I would give this restaurant a lower rating, but the three items I mentioned at the beginning of the review were ok and others in my party enjoyed them.  If I was basing this review only on the food that I ordered, I would give it one or two stars.  I will not be back.",

I would love to give it five stars but I don't know maybe I am ordering The wrong thing the only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because the prices are simply outrageous for what you get. When I get something to go Albeit I'm from Southern California where Indian restaurants abound but that usually includes rice and naan that is not the case here and that is so annoying! I spent $20 for one person today for lunch. Very classy inside the staff is very friendly I love that even the chef interacts with you but they've just got to do something about their pricing maybe reduce the portion sizes I don't know...okay update the owner himself sent me a message and said they would take a look at this & review now that's what I call customer service!",

Our entrees (chicken curry spicy and chicken tikka masala medium) as well as our side of aloo gobi medium were not as flavorful as the samosas. The flavor was good start, but the spices could be kicked up quite a bit in my opinion, and I don't like too much spice. The rice and garlic nann staples were good. Overall, it was good (a little pricey) but if we return, I would ask for a lot more flavor and heat.",

It does face south to Cactus and  is on the north side of the street w/ good signage. Always follow your nose when looking for Indian food. It's pretty much unmatched when it comes to the senses, both olfactory and taste. We had a rushed lunch and ordered a side of samosas These were larger and golden brown and just right when it comes to crispy than most other places offer up. The dips of tamarind sauce and mint chutney were perfect and complimented them for that heightened duo of perfection. The Chicken tikka masala and basmati rice was simply superb as was the lamb curry. Too bad they didn't serve masala dosa at the time. I'm not sure if they added that to the menu but it's a hallmark of South Indian food which probably is why they didn't offer it. This restaurant serves primarily North Indian cuisine as far as I know, but it's really authentic and we enjoyed the whole ambience and experience. Good hosts and the chef came out to chat (chaat) w/ us wanting to know how we liked everything. We gave him the thumbs up which he obviously liked. I never hold back on suggestions if asked, and he did and listened carefully! Yes I recommend it to anyone who relishes Indian fare and to newbies as well. Not too spicy! That seems to be an issue with people not familiar with Indian cuisine. Enjoy!",

Marigold Maison is easily my favorite restaurant of all times. We've been coming here actually when they were at a different location with a different name many years ago, and it's been awesome to follow their changes and growth, and they still have us coming back!! The chef is wowwwwwww, he does some magic with his hands! The seasonings, the flavorings, everything is fresh and made right there, you can literally watch them make your food, and it tastes so so so good. My favorite thing to get is the tandoori style salmon with naan bread and I could eat it almost everyday it tastes so freaking good. Their sauces are spectacular, the staff is super cool and friendly, we've gotten quite acquainted with them since we go there so regularly, and they are just good genuine people which makes going there even better. I recommend this place for everyone, even if you feel like it's not your typical style of food, it is definitely worth trying!",

There are a bunch of 5 star reviews, but be careful, because they are offering gift certificates for Yelp reviews. They had a \"restaurant consultant\" there who was driving the turnaround of this place, which is by the same people who did the failed Bombay Spice.  They are definitely playing the Yelp game.  I am not saying this place was terrible or anything... just not remotely authentic and pretty average despite all the pumped up Yelp reviews.

The ground chicken dip appetizer and samosas were quite good - the chicken is served with naan for dipping and is creamy good.  The samosas were hot and crispy on the outside.  For entrees, we tried the standby tikka masala, which seemed too much like thick tomato soup for me.   The kashmir korma was good but pretty bland - it was ordered mild, but ended up not being very flavorful.  The vindaloo was hot and spicy as expected.  We also tried a tandoori shrimp and the shrimp biryani.  Both were good, but would have been better without the shells of the shrimp.  It was crowded and felt a bit cramped, but may have to try it for a quieter lunch to see if it's more relaxing.  Prices are overall fair, but creep up quickly if you order a glass of wine or two at $10 each (samosa, tikka, naan, 2 wines = over $50 with tip.  Overall, it was OK and competes with other Indian restaurants in town.",

My favorite is the Lamb Thali, and it comes with lamb vindaloo, lamb curry, dal, naan, and kala jamun. Absolutely perfect, and a great value!   Service is absolutely friendly and welcoming. Very helpful folks who talk pride in this restaurant. What's not to love?",

This place is good, perhaps a bit on the pricey side around dinner time (relatively), but their Thali lunch platter is an excellent value. For dinner, I would highly recommend the chicken tikka masala with the spice on the side, as they do not make it particularly spicy and everyone's spice tolerance is different. The portions are decent, could be a bit larger for the price, but enough to satisfy most people. The atmosphere is classy, yet casual, a great place for lunch or dinner with someone special, although it is not particularly quiet and does not offer much privacy, especially around dinner time. Indian Paradise was our favorite restaurant in town and our go-to for a quick dinner, but now that they have closed we will be frequenting the Marigold Maison as it is a close second. We look forward to coming here often in the future.",

We had the Lamb Saag and the Chicken Tikka Masala (which incidentally is not an Indian dish but one allegedly created in Scotland of all places!!), and they were excellent.  Each of them had a very slightly different taste (the Masala had a nice light sweetness and the Saag had a real taste of spinach), but we really liked them.    We prefer food that is flavorful rather than just fiery hot, and Marigold Maison's mild version was perfect.  You could taste the flavors while still getting some kick to keep it interesting.  I agree with some of the other commentators that the prices seem slightly higher than some others, particularly given the non-fancy ambiance, but the portions are very generous.  We had plenty to take home and enjoy the next day.  Also, the staff was friendly and attentive (although we were there on a night that wasn't very busy due to the rain - yes it rains in Phoenix).  We liked it enough to buy a gift certificate, so we will be going back.",

As happens with all businesses, even the best of them, sometimes things just go wrong from start to finish.  Tonight's dinner was just that.  It was so uncharacteristic of them that at the end of dinner I felt compelled to speak to our server about it.  As a well-trained, caring professional himself, he relayed the message, and soon Mr. Kumar arrived to discuss.  And a True discussion it was; polite, respectful, sincere, eager to immediately improve the situation, and followed-up (before we left) to relay his findings regarding the events, etc. The handling of the situation was exceptional. We left feeling appreciated and will certainly come back very soon.  Going out for dinner is so much more than just the meal, and tonight reaffirmed why so many appreciate Marigold Maison.

At one point we flagged her down to ask if there was a mistake to which she responded with \"That IS medium. Hot is even hotter.\" So the dish sat there untouched, we didn't even take a doggie bag home. We weren't offered the opportunity to replace the $20 dish. Nothing.

We started with Vegetable Pakora - which everywhere else is nice bite size pieces of chile, onion, califlower, etc., but at Marigold Maison was like the small pieces remaining in a bag of potato chips.  They were such small pieces that you couldn't even dip them in the chutney - you had to scoop some \"pakora\" and toss it into your mouth, then scoop some chutney and shove it in.  We also had the Lamb Vindaloo and Chicken Tikka Masala.  Both sauces were so bland, it was like Italian food.  And the  Naan was over cooked so that half of it was basically a cracker - not a good springy bread that could soak up a sauce, like naan should be.  The prices were outrageous for the quality and quantity provided.  We had 1 appetizer, 2 orders of naan, 2 entrees and 4 beers - bill came to $85 before tip.  Also, server tried to take away our entree bowls before we were done.  I guess he thought that since we ate the 8 or so pieces of meat, that we were done.  I eat Indian food for the  SAUCE.  But I guess since the sauce really sucked that many of the customers at Marigold Maison just leave it.  I won't be back.",

This place is best for people who are 'new' to Indian food who need something easier to start with (and help navigating thru the menu). In that respect, it's a great concept. All the best !!",

    "text": "I agree with Jessica below. Although I can't speak to Indian food in India, I grew accustomed to excellent Indian food while living in England. Almost nothing over here compares. That is, except for Marigold Maison. This place is absolutely fantastic.  We ordered the samosas, masala dosa, garlic naan, chicken tandoori, lamb vindaloo, and gulab jamun. It was all flawless: explosive flavor, beautiful presentations, hearty servings. I ate long after I was full. Add to that craft beer and excellent service. I left feeling very, very happy. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!   My only complaint is that the quality of the ice cream was incongruent with how wonderful the gulab jamun was. There were ice crystals in mine, and the flavor itself was a little bland. I'd look into a higher quality ice cream or gelato.",

The place was very busy but when I walked in the door I was met with those all familiar delicious smells of a good meal to come.  We were not disappointed the portions were good and delicious.  My wife is a vegetarian and when she says the Dal is really good you can take that to the bank.

We came in on a Sunday at lunch time and took the waiter's recommendation for the platter options. If we're speaking of taste: pretty good! However, the portions were far from heaping and the naan provided was enough for about five bites. When we ordered more naan, between 10 and 15 minutes passed before it made its way to the table, by which time the remainder of our food had gone cold. It's worth mentioning that the place became very busy during that time, and this deal-breaking service could very likely be attributed to this factor.",

Yummy little bowls filled with goodness come out on your own personal platter.  Each little dish was unique and delicious in its own way. The flavors are robust and appealing to your taste buds. I ate every single morsel treasuring each bite. Can't wait to try a different dish next time!   Btw. The service is phenomenal. When I told our waitress my lack of knowledge of the Indian cuisine, she went over every thing on my platter in great detail. She was an extremely hospitable server.",

I'm very fussy when it comes to Indian food and this is not your run of the mill restaurant.  The food is much spicier than typical American-style Indian food (although much blander than authentic) and they have many options for vegetarians.  They are so amazing, they just expanded the restaurant a few months ago.  The new bar / happy hour area looks like it could be a modern sports bar.  It has a very unusual setup as half the bar is outside (under the awning) and the other half is inside.  For such a new restaurant, you know they are doing something right when they have to expand so quickly and are often busy.  Insider Tip!  Friday night and Saturday night, get a reservation.  They sometimes run out of tables or have a long wait.",

They have all the typical curries like Tikka Masala,Vindaloo,korma, makhani and saag.Also the quintessential south Indian dishes like Dosa and Idly. The lunch menu is a VFM kind of deal you have options for Vegetable/chicken/Lamb/Seafood.All the thali's are served with rice,dal,naan,and gulab jamun(My Favorite). The Quinoa salad (Quinoa, chickpea, cucumber, tomato, onions, tossed in fresh citrus juices) has the makings of an interesting fusion dish.  They also have some street food options like Samosa chaat,Aloo chaat ,Bhel and Golguppa. I tried their Golguppa and i wouldn't cal it excellent but it did help fill the void in my heart until i visit India again.Now Golguppa also known as Pani puri is Whole wheat puffs with potato, chickpea, and spice water.It must be popped into the mouth whole to be enjoyed in all its glory.I would say it's a Must try. Anyone from India knows Golguppa is not just street food it's a CULT!!!  The staff is friendly and attentive.They also have outdoor seating. It's a good place for simple,fresh and delicious Indian food.  Cheers!",

We have tried the majority of vegetarian curries and have enjoyed all of them wholeheartedly. My girlfriend is obsessed with the classic saag paneer, and I can't get enough of the amazing kofta. The samosa and the dosas are very delicious as well! I don't think there has been a time we haven't ordered the saag or the samosa. We've also had their veg lunch special w/ 2 varying curries, rice, naan, and misc dessert. Very filling!  There is something for everyone here!   They recently expanded - lots of seating and a new fancy bar area. Unfortunately caused a spike in menu prices, but well worth the little extra $! Servers are very friendly and always accommodating to large groups.  Both of our hearts and tummys are so happy after we come here! It's so good we bring visiting family, friends, and couchsurfers here! My mouth is watering as I write this review!!   *4/5 vegetarian friendly! Tons of delicious options!",

That was SO thoughtful!  The food here is outstanding!  We've been here previously and never been disappointed.  On this most recent visit, I had the Manchurian cauliflower and my husband had the chicken tikka masala.  I think I could eat that cauliflower every day - it's my favorite item on the menu.

The lentils were well made and the basmati rice fine, but overall they need to figure out a number of new recipes. I don't think we will be coming back.

    "text": "This was my first time here.  I went with a large group, and I had an opportunity to try about 5 different dishes along with several different appetizers.  Let's start with the positive - the tandoori salmon was heavenly.  The naan was hot, crispy, and flavorful. Everything else was truly disappointing.  The dishes either totally lack flavor, or they were just all heat and no substance.  My review is on the flavor of the food, not the heat level.  For me, the heat level on most of the dishes was inadequate.   For the dishes where the heat levels were adequate, they substituted heat for flavor.   I have eaten at dozens of Indian restaurants; I usually eat Indian food about 8 to 12 times a year.  I absolutely love Indian cuisine in general, but not here.  The servers were attentive and very pleasant; I have no problem with the wait staff.  The ambience is very nice too.  This review is on the food alone.  When I look at the other reviews, my guess is that the patrons who frequent this restaurant have not been to many other Indian food destinations.  I can think of about three locations within 15 minutes of this restaurant where the food quality is another league.  I could give you a list of about a dozen other Indian restaurants in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area that blow this place out of the water.  With so much awesome Indian food in the valley, I would say that you could skip this restaurant, and you wouldn't be missing anything.  I actually don't give many bad reviews, and I would give it 2 1/2 stars if possible.  I figured I would round up to 3, just to be nice.  Everything about the restaurant is perfectly fine, except the food is average at best.  The portions were substantial and the prices were reasonable; the food was just completely unimpressive.  I won't be back, but I actually can't wait to return to one of my old standbys because I didn't realize how good they were until I had a chance to compare them to this restaurant.",

I would not return here for the food as the pricing was expensive for what we received.

The lamb korma was absolutely wonderful. Packed with flavor and lamb. The shrimp appetizer I also had was absolutely unreal. Huge shrimp and cooked perfectly. I have not been to a better restaurant.

Garlic Naan and Tikka Masala were both worth ordering and I can't help but think I'd give 4 stars if I hadn't been spoiled by Curry Corner in Tempe which simply had richer flavors (and if there's one thing I noticed here is that they could use more spice and flavor in their dishes....although the side sauces definitely help.)    All in all, good value and worth a visit if you are in the neighborhood.   If there was a 3 1/2 star option that's where I'd place this experience.",

On my first visit with a few girlfriends, we went on a weeknight and shared a few things family style: Masala Dosa, Shrimp Tikka Masala, and Chicken Kashmir Korma... with naan and rice as well.  I took a bite of one friend's Quinoa Salad too.  That night everything was divine!    On my next visit, I went with my husband, and it was a Saturday night.  The place was beyond packed and the waitstaff beyond slammed, but still attentive and friendly.  Actually, Abraham was an incredible waiter, making suggestions upon request and chatting with us throughout the time we spent there.  However, the food was not quite as amazing as I remembered.  We had the Shrimp Tikka Masala, the Saag Spinach with Chicken, with naan and rice.  The Tikka was a bit too rich and buttery, and the Saag was lacking in flavor ironically.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't what I talked it up to be.  I'm hoping it was just an off night as I do hope to return again!  I specifically would like to return to try the Biryani Hyderabadi with lamb... I saw a few tables had it and it comes highly recommended!  Worth noting that this place serves beer, wine and natural refreshments... and they do take reservations.  They also offer delivery via postmates.",

As we were seated, our drinks and food were ordered but we never saw our server again...serve didnt seem personable just very rushed.

    "text": "I wonder what the hype about this place is. To sum it up - There are far better restaurants serving much more \"authentic Indian\", not worth your money and travel time, especially if your driving up from the South.  Now a bit more deeper into what a family of four  ordered here -  A Veg Platter  , Lamb Platter and Chicken Platter - it was a lunch special (so much for the special-ness )  Platter all combined - The Bad : 1)The Platter had a standard Yellow Dal - which was Bland utterly Bland. 2)The Paneer was overcooked in the saag paneer, 3)The Chicken Masala was Sweet - soo much for the masala 4)The Cold Jeer Rice served with it 5) The Priceand the quantity - @14$ per platter you are better off having a sumptuous buffet at some decent Indian Restaurant and eating to your fill rather than being limited by their sub-par quality of food  The good : 1) The Lamb vindaloo was the only highlight 2) The Jamoon had a good texture and was well done  The Ugly : SERVICE - the Server we had was possibly the worst we have encountered ever , we had to keep mentioning everything twice and keep reminding him we had an order we placed. Here you are \"required\" to tip even if you had a bad service experience, well we did.  Can you believe he had the audacity to come up and say he cant accept such a Low tip (which could have been better off had it been a ZERO) ? Bravo !!  And yeah, they serve you Half a Naan in the platter - soo much for cost cutting!  Ambiance:     2.0/5 Food taste:    2.0/5  Service:         0.0/5 Price:             2.0/5 Overall:          1.0/5  This place stands as a testimony of mocking Indian Food by all standards  Sub Par non-authentic Food, unmetered prices and topped with horrendous Service - welcome to MariGold  AVOID IT!!",

We ordered chicken curry, chicken biriyani and malai kofta, everything sucked big time.   Chicken curry - bland, no where close to authentic Indian curry.   \"South Indian\" biriyani - I'm from the southern India and a  Hyderabadi myself and I guarantee that the biriyani made here is not southern at all. I don't even know if any part of India makes biriyani like this.   Malai kofta and naan (garlic and chili) - expensive!!!! Dry naan. Chill naan just has chilli powder- it is supposed to have cut green chilies!! Kofta should be rich and creamy. This is nothing of that sort.   Overall - So many better restaurants with lower prices and with soooo much better food. If you want authentic food, never go here.",

    "text": "I would love for this place to be a go-to Indian place for me, but unfortunately I have to pass. I really, really love the idea and I love its intimate size, but it just seems to be a little too impressed with itself.  Firstly, the prices are too high. I know you're doing \"something new and funsion-y\" with Indian food, but please. $20 for a dish just because it has fish? It certainly doesn't warrant that, nor do the other dishes whose prices increase as you add meat selections like chicken, etc.  The last time I was here my husband and I ordered an eggplant dish and the chicken tikka masala.  I must say the chicken tikka sauce's flavor was OUTSTANDING. Definitely the best I've tasted - very robust and wonderful.   The eggplant however, was terribly overpowered by chipotle. Yuck. I've not had those two paired together and I think there's a reason for that. Eggplant is so delicate and its flavor is best supported by the herbs and spices in the dish so its butteriness can be savored - not drowned out by an overly bold spice. Not a well constructed dish at all.  Also, both dishes were supposed to be mildly spiced. Our server asked for the spice level, we told her mild (husband doesn't do well with too much spice), and the food came out *at least* medium spiced or hotter. The eggplant was so spicy we had to send it back. My guess is that the chipotle had a lot to do with that, as its inherent heat certainly added to the additional spice used to give the spice gradient to the dishes. Again - chipotle - BAD IDEA.  The service that night also was not up to par and certainly didn't support the $46 bill we had at the end. The server *meandered* over to our table after we'd been sitting there for a little too long and kind of looked at us askance WAITING for us to tell her what we wanted. Like she couldn't be bothered too much to let more than just a few words out of her mouth. It was very strange. And the restaurant was NOT busy; no one was in the weeds.  All in all, I'm not really impressed enough to make this a regular place. For the prices I expect excellent professional service, well-crafted dishes, and chefs that understand mild, medium, and hot as it relates to Indian food.",

I was the only person there which I hope is due to the fact that I came unknowingly just as they opened, because I really want this place to succeed.    Ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Garlic Naan (my go-to at all Indian restaurants because I love it ok?) and while I didn't find them the best I've ever had I can say they were really good.  My one nit picky pseudo complaint is that the masala sauce was a little more liquidy than I'm used too, but that was a minor issue considering that the flavor was there.   It is a bit pricey but I knew that ahead of time and dont really blame the place because the portions are quite large (please dont change that!).  This is without question the best Indian food in this area.  I repeat in this area because there is of course better in the city, but I mean within a 5 mile radius.    I will return for my garlic naan and tikka cravings.",

My friend had the lental soup and I tried it and liked it.  I had a mango shake which I loved!  I did like the old set up before the change over but I don't really care either way, great food is great food and they definitely have great indian food.  I was full but I had to try the dessert. I got the ice cream with a small pastry type of food and it was great. It was like an awesome little doughnut. My friend had the rice pudding and I thought it was the best I've ever had. I've always had rice pudding that was made Greek style but this was totally different and had cool unique flavors.  All the staff did a great job so I have no complaints. I'll be back often.",

    "text": "Well, I'm a bit confused. And I got the feeling they were too. The article I read in the New Times said they were like the \"Chipotle\" of Indian cuisine. When we arrived, we were greeted by a friendly server who apologetically explained that for now, they were going with a \"sit-down\" concept until they work some things out.   The menu seemed quite small, but that could be a good thing right? That means they should be expertly crafted dishes.   I asked for their choice of beverages. That got confusing because I didn't want the alcohol choices, just beverages other than water. I was told the list of soda options but I asked for \"other\" nonalcoholic beverages. Finally a connection was made. I chose a lime and ginger juice drink. When I received it, there was no detectable ginger in it. The server assured me that it contained ginger because he knew they had ginger in the kitchen. Then he came back to inform me that he tasted it and I was correct. There was no ginger. Then he said the manager tasted it and said, \"oh, there's supposed to be ginger in there?\"   So, the food was ok. The chicken masala was my favorite. The chana dal was a little bland, and the saag chicken was ok. The bread was too oily. The rice was dry. And the rice pudding was kind of weird, but I liked the hint of rose water. I would have liked a creamier texture with rice that didn't seem like it was chopped up in the food processor first. And I don't know if a side of rice and a rice dessert was such a good idea.   It was an awkward time of day to go there-right between when they close for two hours before dinner service. We were kind of locked in, followed by an apology from the manager that he was not locking us in, but rather locking others out.   The non-ginger drinks were taken off our bill so for the price of our lunch $25, it was ok. I don't think I'd return for lunch, but I'd be willing to see what they can do for the dinner menu. But wait-I'm still wishing they had implemented the Chipotle-style set-up which is what brought me here in the first place.",

I really like their Kati Roll and frequently cater it for work events even though a few of my colleagues are snobs and say it's not authentic.  Be sure to ask for a little heat, since \"regular\" is a little too bland...it's Indian food after all and should have a bit of spice to it.",

    "text": "I have been to Marigold Maison several times and I always order the vegetable tikka misala prepared vegan.  It was one of my favorite dishes in the entire valley.   A group of us went for dinner on 3/4/2017.  I placed my order for vegetable tikka masala and asked that it be made vegan.  Shortly after the waiter took our order he returned and said that the vegetable tikka masala can't be made vegan.  Another person from the restaurant came to our table and said that they no longer make it vegan because they had to purchase coconut milk in a large size and they had too much waste in their restaurant if not enough people requested vegan which would mean substituting coconut milk for cream.   Their menu clearly states that any vegetarian item can be made vegan.  It seems logical that they would stand behind their menu and carry the items needed to veganize dishes.  Coconut milk comes in lots of sizes including cans which have a long shelf life.   They have lost me as a customer.",

We started off with Garlic Naan then she had Tikka Masala and I had Biryani Hyderabadi. Every dish was explained to her by our waiter and boy were they fantastic. We'll definitely be going back SOON !!!",
