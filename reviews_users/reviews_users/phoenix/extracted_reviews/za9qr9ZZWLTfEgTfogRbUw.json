    "text": "I hope David's Hamburgers & Mexican Food burgers are better than their Mexican food.  David's has a '50's theme that for some reason always raises the caution flag. Yet it was clean and very empty, however I arrived right in the dead zone between lunch and dinner.   After a quick look at the menu I ordered the chicken enchiladas. The server then asked a strange question, \"Would you like the free chips and salsa that come with the meal?\"  \"Well yes a would thank you.\", I replied. My free chips soon arrived as did my salsa. The salsa was freshly made but about as bland as one can make salsa, not a good sign. After a short wait my enchiladas arrived. I must say they looked quite good. Yet after the first bite it all went down hill. Bland sauce, bland chicken, dry chicken did nothing to improve on the salsa. The refried beans that came with the enchiladas were too bad, not great, but good. The in house made guac was excellent. Service was average. My un-enjoyable didn't get finished which should tell you something.   Enchiladas, soft drink and free chips $13 with tax.  Will I be back? Maybe, the reviews for the burgers are quite good. The in house made guac almost got it 3 stars. Just say a big NO for the Mexican.",

Considering the lackadaisical effort, the $1 delivery charge is a crock of shit.   Food is usually alright from what I remember.  Was alright this time.  I'm still all set with them.",

Lunch hour and it took almost 20 minutes for a hamburger patty that couldn't have been on the grill for a minute. The David's Deluxe isn't by any way except weight maybe. Could have been the 1 1/2\" - to 2\" of chopped lettuce. Sure wasn't the single piece of bacon , pickles or patty.  Maybe I should have tried the Mexican, but you can be sure I want be making a drive from East Mesa to Scottsdale for just that.,",

You can get flavored sodas like an old fashioned soda fountain.  I usually get vanilla coke, sometimes cherry coke. I have always eaten in.  The breakfasts are decent.  My only objection was with the fried potatoes.  It looked like they had taken french fries and diced them up and fried them.  Kind of disappointing as i am a big fan oh home fries with real potatoes. Definitely worth a visit in my book.",

The place was clean, not spotless, but clean.   I ordered the guacamole burger. It came with pepper jack cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes. You can also get fries, onion rings, or cole slaw included in the cost of the burger. I got fries. I also got a Dr. Pepper. The fries were good, but nothing noteable. The burger was also good. Perfectly cooked to what I ordered. The guacamole was amazing and everything else was good.  What really stood out to me was the service here. My server was a slender middle aged man with grey/white hair and glasses. I sadly did not catch his name. He gave me PHENOMENAL service. I was greeted promptly, he was knowledgeable about the menu, he checked back on me often, but not too often. My beverage was NEVER empty and he was professional in his conduct. He even gave me a to-go cup so I could have Dr. Pepper when I left. I sincerely hope that all of their staff are this way and that he is recognized for his AMAZING service. I will return to David's on this aspect alone.  To conclude, the food was good, the building was pleasant, and the service was PERFECT. I recommend you try David's Hamburgers and Mexican Food.",

For $1, you can add chilli, so fuck yeah, I got myself a chilli burger.  I haven't done that in years and I regret NOTHING.  They have good fries and I had some onion rings to share between me and my girlfriend, too.  They also serve Mexican food which I'm curious to try, but in a much more morbid form of curiosity, the same level of curiosity that allows young men to watch horrible, horrible videos online.  Chances are, if you serve burgers and burritos, either only one will be good or both will be terrible.  I don't think they can do both; historically, I've never experienced this, but I'm not gonna ding 'em on something I've never tried.  Overall, they're attentive, they have damn reasonable prices and their burgers and fuckin' YUM.",

    "text": "Walked past this place the other day looking for a quick bite to eat that was nothing fancy.  The place was nearly empty on a Friday afternoon around lunch time.  There was really no theme from a decor perspective other than an under funded diner in the \"middle of no-where\" in the middle of America struggling to make ends meet.  Bare walls with no even any art up and the back wall had some exposed electrical wiring.  Well, this is not in the \"middle of no-where\" but rather the middle of Scottsdale and I expected a bit more.  Nevertheless, I decided to give it a True.  The server was very attentive and kind.  I asked her what was good here and the suggestion was the Davids Burgers and anything Mexican on the menu.  I choose the David's Burger, thinking the signature item with the owners name on it would be at least good.  I was wrong, the burger bland, too much lettuce and onions and there was a thick slice of cheese the was dry and completely clashed with the rest of the burger.  Furthermore, the bun was not even warm.  Come'on guys at least put the bun on the grill and warm it up a bit.    As much as I tried to fairly have this place a second star, I just could not.",

I did my order and paid and I got a notification that it'd be here by 6:25pm and it is now 7pm. Thirty mins late, I am upset and starving at this point  so I called the restaurant. I spoke to a boy and I told him I want a refund and to keep the food - he didn't apologize for the wait or say I understand why your upset but instead he left me on hold for over 10 minutes. I am beyond disappointed since I am a regular here, I also have my whole bank ordering from them while we work. I will no longer give them a cent of my money and I will make sure everyone that wants to order from them if it's my family, friends, co workers.. I will make sure they don't waste their time and money on this place.",

If you have been to the Habit Grill or in-n-out burgers you will notice a similarity. The space is tiny & they might be crowded at times.  We went around 1:00 on Saturday after attending the Scottsdale Arts Fair (very good) and the normal lunch crowd was probably at the food truck area of the arts fair or the many other restaurants in downtown Scottsdale.  Our timing that day was good but it was getting busier when we left. I could not pickup any wifi so you'll depend on cell coverage.  Due to the small space they probably do not encourage you to linger.",

    "text": "We've ordered delivery here multiple times without any issues. Today, issues! I got the route 87 burger and asked to have it without mayo (which was correct when I got it) and also coleslaw (fries were delivered instead). My husband got the Texas Burger and we got a Carne asada burrito for later.   We already knew that it would take about 45 to an hour to be delivered as it states when you make the purchase, as we did and got confirmation around 1:14pm today. So it literally did take about an hour for our order to get here and what do you think the food was?.. well cold of course. The burrito was warm because it was wrapped up in foil but still, who likes cold food?  I went to open up my brown bag that contained my burger and instead of what I expected I saw fries!! My husband checked his, just in case they put the coleslaw in his and nope.. fries!  After the disappointment in wanting coleslaw as we put in our order; cold burger, soggy fries (I had one to just have it).   So I called in and let them know what had happened, and I was told that when the delivery drivers come back they would come back and deliver what I ordered.. my coleslaw.  Okay, so all is fixed right? No. I waited and waited and well, waited, and wait... no coleslaw? Yes that is correct! I literally waited 1hr to call back as there was no coleslaw in sight! (Originally called at 2:11pm to see what happened and again around 3:06pm.. was tired of waiting)  When I called back in a women answered and yet again I told them what had happened and she tried to call one of the delivery drivers and they would not answer. Hmmm. So anyways, I told her I just wanted my coleslaw as I originally ordered and that it has been over an hour, we are literally right around the corner, where is my coleslaw?  She then said as soon as they get back (heard it all before) I'd get my coleslaw.. then I was told that on my next order I would get 20% off. Hmm so no coleslaw, but if and I mean IF I decide to get delivery I'll get this amount off? We'll see if that even happens.  I do plan on getting their food again, but next time would be dine in as this experience has really turned me off about them.  Honestly, they are probably about 5 minutes away from me, so if I decide to dine in, I hope that they honor what they have said and if not I will never eat their food again.  I know it wasn't a huge mess up, but the way it was handled I believe was wrong and I am still craving the coleslaw that I never got. The principle about fixing an order reins high in my mind and as it was not corrected I am utterly disappointed.",

I love the food, cooked well, nice seasoning and great shakes!  I think the price is right for what you get, the decorations are really cute, like diner and pinup-ish, however the staff seems really annoyed by idk questions about the food or asking for a side of sauce or whatever. They looked at me like I was crazy when I asked to get my menu back to see what kind of flavors they have for ice cream, \"Well, you can just go look...\" OKAY, but I'm asking you now, then I explained I wanted shake flavors and she told me a couple. I got up and looked at the menu later and would have ordered different ones if I had gotten my menu back. Shake my head. I definitely don't let that get me down though with how cozy the place is and yummy the food is!  Usually it's not that busy with plenty of seating and occasionally they have obscure performers, first time I was there they had a duel piano player, haven't seen him since though.

Every breakfast we have had there was good. Better than good.   But I think the name \"David's Hamburgers\" undersells this place that's certainly deserving of your business. For one thing, people don't associate hamburgers with breakfast. I think a better name for this restaurant would be \"David's Diner.\" Such a broad name would help grab the attention of diners early in the morning, as well as during other parts of the day and evening.

Please clean it up Davids",

Ordered, then waited 45 minutes for food. Order was wrong - food was cold. Ordered fruit that was not delivered, no sauce on benedict lorraine; toast was cold, eggs dry, We had to ask for silverware and napkins. Other tables were getting slow service also.  No ice tea. They took 20 % off for slow service. Will not go back.",

But, I had a 2 4 1 entree coupon via my new entertainment book, so a colleague and I decided to give Davids a try.  And what a cute little 50s style diner it is!  :)  We called in our order and walk over.  When we get there, we let the guy (maybe it's David himself) know that we phoned in our order.  And a minute later he brings out our Davids burger.    Tasty burger.  Handmade burger I believe.  It was falling apart on us.  All in all, fast and friendly service.  Decent eats.  We'll be back !  :)",

The tuna melt is epic, the hamburgers are delicious and yes, even the Mexican food is awesome. Their fries stay crispy even after they're cold. I can't say enough hood things about everything they do right but I forgot to mention how good their breakfast is, too. I just ordered from there again after writing this review because my review made me hungry for their food. Mmm... blueberry pancakes. You can even get bacon in your pancakes here!",

The place has the vibe and is decorated in a 50's Diner motif.  Music played from the time period and there's a soda like bar in the center of the restaurant.  The server gave me the menu and after a few minutes I decided to get:  Texas BBQ Burger (Cheddar Cheese, BBQ Ranch Sauce, Onion Rings, Bacon) - $6.15  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=8vow_cM6bCgIO0HWGbCizw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/za9q...</a> Hot Dog (Nathan's Hot Dog, Onions, Relish, Mustard) - $4.50 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=aJkenAKKYIXTrSK1Of9b0Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/za9q...</a>  The food came out pretty fast.  I was pleased to see 2 large pieces of real Bacon sticking out the side of the Burger....yum!   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=82Ua27nge5lTTx9N7g2rAg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/za9q...</a> I went for that first.  The Onion Rings in the Burger were nice and crispy and had good flavor.  The BBQ Sauce was slightly tangy and went well with the other ingredients....and of course there's the Bacon.....perfectly cooked, not too burnt not too undercooked, just right!  All together it was an awesome Burger.  Next up was the Hot Dog.  The Dog comes split in half (I like it that way). <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/za9qr9ZZWLTfEgTfogRbUw?select=uPb_Py9o7hP_7UCBsIqc-Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/za9q...</a> Cooked just right, the Hot Dog had a nice slight 'snap' to it.  The Onions and Relish were fresh and went together well with all the fixins.  Fries came with both orders.....there was too much, so I didn't finish them....but they were very good.  The server was very friendly and was always checking on me.  It was a great dining experience.  Return Factor - 90%",

I then called back up and this time i spoke to a guy a he said that he didn't know they were supposed to send anything back out. it was just completely bad customer service. if you screw something up, you don't promise to fix it and then don't deliver.

I was surprised because he didn't tell me he ordered it, so it was delightful to see a gentlemen at my door holding a milkshake & a bag of food!   My boyfriend knows me pretty well so he hit the nail on the hammer with ordering the chocolate & peanut butter milkshake, which was still very cold, creamy & excellent! He also got me a slice of apple pie, which was still warm & delicious! But when it came down to the opening the large box, I realized something had went wrong. It was a box of cheesy bacon fries. Normally, for most people that would be an awesome mistake & no one would really care because seemingly everyone loves bacon. Unfortunately, I am one of the rare & few individuals who doesn't not enjoy bacon. I always pick it out or off of things & give it to my boyfriend! But to give them credit, the fries were crispy & hot, covered in awesome tillamook cheddar & generously doused in big hunks of bacon. I tried to eat a few pieces of fries but the bacon flavor was infused in the melty cheese & I just closed the box & put it in the refrigerator for my boyfriend to eat. He just warmed them up under the broiler & loved them but was pretty upset that they didn't deliver his original request for me which was the CARNE ASADA fries! Despite this mix up, the portions were generous, it arrived quickly & it did make my day that I opened my apartment door to a milkshake! Especially while feeling under the weather, it did brighten my day!  I live very close to this place so I think we will check this place out one more time at least to see what it's all about. I want my carne asada fries & they also have Mexican  food & burgers. The milkshake & pie were legit from what I have tried so far, but the bacon fries were a turn off for me personally.",

It is always hard to get a hold of someone to place an order and more often then not we are left 'on hold\" which means placed on the counter to hear everyone's conversations.. 10 min later we are usually helped and it takes quite a while for the person to take the order down. One of my biggest problem with Davids is we order for the office 4 different  meal orders, all being delivered to the same location, and each order is slapped with a delivery charge. ( most other lunch spots we order from divide that fee up or only charge once.) Its a bummer when choosing lunch that we have started to look elsewhere so we don't have to deal with their customer service.",

I have this unspoken agreement with local restaurants- I will continue to pay them for their food up until the moment that they decide that they don't want my money. There are myriad ways to get this point across- they could bring my food half an hour late with no explanation or apology, which of course means cold food. They could also change the quality of food for the worse, that's a big one. They could also overcharge me and refuse to apologize for their mistake.   However, it seems that David's Hamburgers and Mexican Food wants me to continue to give them money, because the quality of the food is consistent and delicious, the delivery is right around the proposed time, and the customer service is perfect. I will continue to shove your food into the lowest hole in my head at this rate.  Also- their hot pastrami sandwich is the best I've had on this bloody coast.",

As for the burger, it wasn't as good as my previous visit over a year agao - nothing ever is it seems. They use frozen fries and onion rings, but claim to use fresh meat. I don't understand why you wouldn't make more of an effort with your fries/rings if you focus on burgers. David's Burger is set up like an in and Out burger right down to the thousand Island, so for about 3 bucks less you can get fresh fries and the same burger over there basically.  For some reason, the Patty Melt that my date had looked good, but overall this place is a dinasaur in the burger wars in the area. And hold the Gnats next time please.",

We ordered 2 of their pulled pork taco specials and a salad. While none of these dishes were particularly special, they all tasted great. The pulled pork tacos came with 3 tacos, beans, rice, and a lovely dollop of guacamole and sour cream. The salad was huge, a wonderful portion for its price.  Service was good, too; food came out in a timely fashion. All together, no complaints! Good for families!",

The place is quaint and the service was friendly. The burger was a burger, nothing special. The taco salad was unique, served with with bacon and ranch dressing. It was surprising but good. I do t think either dish was something we would crave but it's good if you're in the area and don't want to drive or weak elsewhere to eat.",

    "text": "We live in Old Town Scottsdale and walk by this place often and thought we would try it for breakfast this morning.  Not a good experience.  Should have known when we walked in and nobody else was there but thought maybe they had just opened.  The young lady who sat us and served us was nice but was clearly training.  She asked us for drink orders and when my wife ordered an ice tea she said they hadn't made it yet.  Rule #1 in business is make sure you are ready when you open the doors.  No offer of making some just didn't have it ready yet.  The music was too loud and apparently they are too cheap to pay for commercial free music so not only was it too loud it was just commercials which ramp up the volume even more.  Because the music was too loud the manager who was working with two younger women was giving them directions in a very loud voice which further killed any chance of a relaxing environment.  The young lady who took our order was very confused.  I gave her my order which she wrote down and my wife gave hers.  She apparently wasn't done writing my order and had to ask what my wife ordered again.  She left and about two minutes later came back and asked my wife what she ordered again.  Given that we were the only ones in the restaurant it had been long enough (15-20 minutes) that we were questioning how long it takes to make a couple of egg dishes.  At this point our waitress comes back and says they don't have any hollandaise for the benedict and would I be OK without it.  We said thanks but no thanks and that we had already been waiting too long and they are just now figuring out they don't have hollandaise on a Sunday morning.  Had they just started making jour breakfast???  Then they still charged us $6 for two sodas.  No apology from anyone.  The manager was standing 10 feet from our table and didn't acknowledge the problem.  We try and support the local businesses and were giving them the benefit of the doubt but for $6 they lost us.  Will never go back.  There are too many good places to eat in Old Town.",

I went online to their own website and placed the order around 735pm. It said closing soon but the order went through. Their ad said they close at 9, deliveries at 8. I received a confirmation email at 8 saying it would take 45 min (so much for speedy!). The food had not came by 850 and I had not received a call from anyone, so I started calling them, but got no answer. We waited until after 9 and slow became never as in the food never came. But the worst part is that it took 2 days and three phone calls to get the money credited back. The day after I was told to call back in the morning when the manager would be in, the next day I was told I had to call Simple Menu to get a refund because they power their online menu. The manager knew who I was and what had happened because the employee said she was calling her to let her know. And yet I had to call again to find out the restaurant can't help me, I have to call somewhere else. I even told them the second time to please tell your manager I'm disappointed. But she hasn't bothered to contact me herself to apologize or make it right. I get that stuff happens, but a good place will make it right. Needless to say, I won't be trying Davids!",

If you're feeling squirrelly, double down on either with a 2nd patty.  They serve breakfast all day, too, which is pretty bad ass and more places should do this.

Trying the Texas Burger appears to be almost mandatory among Yelpers, and a very fine burger it is. The bun is toasted, the bacon is crisp, the onion ring is onion-y, the burger is juicy, the BBQ sauce has tang, and the cheese is... kinda there. The fries are fries. I ate them.  The service is service. It gets you fed.  On the whole, it's not quite on a par with a really top-notch Smashburger, but the relief of getting a nice, simple, affordable dinner in that section of Scottsdale lends savor to the meal.",

Oh sure, oldies, mostly 50's play on the sound system but that's where the correlation between the menu and decor ends. To their credit David's does put out a great burger and the tacos aren't bad either. The chips are served warm and the salsa is actually homemade and quite tasty. I've been here twice and both times there were no more than 3 tables occupied. Even so the service isn't great. If your timing is good you might pass by when the owner is outside handing out 20% coupons. David's is nestled between the high priced trinket shops and restaurants of touristy Old Town Scottsdale. Somehow the place just doesn't fit but the food is good and inexpensive",

First is was the glass I was drinking out of had lipstick stains on the rim, so I re-ordered a new clean glass of soda. I wasn't upset or throw a fit about it, but as soon as I turned my back at the counter the girls there instantly started complaining about it. They didn't seem to care that I could hear them, but I didn't bother. But as we got our meal, two orders weren't right the waitress had to re order and resubmit our ticket. So we waited another 30 minutes, by then everyone was done eating. I again let it slide, but when the waitress served us our meal she looked at me and with an attitude she asked \"is there anything I can get for you your highness?\" Instantly I was upset and requested to speak to a manager. When the manager came she instantly said \"what is it now?!\" I replied \"what is your issue with me? We just asked for our meal and the two orders were wrong and I had to reorder a clean glass of soda. I did nothing wrong and I didn't throw a fit.\" Instantly she stated that according to her staff I was being rude and demanding and my staff does not need that kind of attitude from anyone. I told her over and over again that I didn't give any of your staffs members any attitude and nor was I rude. She asked if there was anything else I would like and turned away to go back to the kitchen. So when we got the bill we were charged for the re orders and the clean glass of soda and they automatically added the gratuity to the order. I was so upset I just paid to get out of there and I never felt so humiliated and felt that it was u fair that I paid for the full meal and their mistake and not to mention the attitude from the staff. I been there twice before and never had an issue. Let's just say I'll be avoiding the place and never would refer anyone to eat there. I hope they don't treat any customers like that, that was very disappointing and very unprofessional.",

The menu has a lot so you don't feel stuck and the prices are very reasonable, my boyfriend got the Texas Burger which he was raving about, and I got a chimichanga. The burger was huge and the chimi was even bigger. The best part was when I called in the order they estimated about 20-25 minute delivery time and the food actually arrived in less than 25 minutes! I'll have to stop in one day and have lunch so I can check out the actual restaurant, but til then NO MORE PIZZA delivery!! At least for a while.",

I have ordered from this place at least 6 times, each time a bad experience. I understand people having a bad day, but not once have I talk to someone on the phone without attitude or treating me like I am inconveniencing them. They have never delivered to me on time, EVER! I ordered for delivery online a few mins past 9am. It said my delivery would be here at 9:58am. I wait until 1030am to call and ask them where my food is. The guy said \"He left about 10 mins ago. He should be there any minute. If he doesn't know up in the next 15, I will call to find out where my driver is.\" ..... ooookay.... 10 mins go by, the delivery guy shows up at my door. Almost irritated, no smile, no apology. I ordered a Two by Four (2 scrambled eggs with 4 pancakes), hot chocolate and vanilla iced coffee with extra x2 vanilla. The eggs and pancakes are luke warm, not to mention I only got 3 pancakes, the bacon is cold and dry, and the coffee was iced black coffee. Terrible.",

I got their chicken sandwich...however it had teriyaki sauce on it? Umm wasn't happy with that but I was very kind and the server fixed it...she didn't replace it but scrapped it off and gave me a new bottom bun. The sauce was still on some of the chicken. It was a decent size, couldn't finish it all. Overall it is a nice place for comfort eating or if you don't want to dress up and be bothered, but that's it.",

    "text": "I think I must have been there the same day as Ron H!!  As Ron mentioned, this is Spring Training time in Scottsdale.  There actually aren't that many breakfast places around in Old Town, and David's should be taking full advantage, but we won't be back next year... sorry David.   I'm just going to list the problems we encountered: 1. Seated and ignored. 2. A table of four came in after us, and they were eating within minutes of our order finally being taken.  They were seated right next to us, so it wasn't as if we couldn't be seen!  The young lady who finally took our order must have been on her first day, but seriously... hello, anybody in there? 3.  The OJ is fresh squeezed and very tasty, but they can only make one glass at a time.  It is not chilled.  The OJ was gone by the time breakfast arrived. 4.  My husband ordered a breakfast sandwich.  I am not a traditional breakfast person, so I ordered a turkey sandwich. 5.  We sat there and sat there and sat there.  The narrator's voice of Hells Kitchen was playing in my head, \"and the guests were getting impatient.\" 6.  Finally, a waitress (not ours), inquired if we had been served yet (since the previously mentioned table of four were leaving after consuming their meals).  She hustled  back to the kitchen and came out with our order, apologizing for the delay.  I figured it was our dingbat server's fault, and I did not hold it against the establishment as a whole, except for the fact no one was following said dingbat around to make sure she was doing her job. 7.  Our food arrived.  My turkey sandwich was tasty, but I was noticing the \"3 slices of bacon\" promoted on the menu were absent.  I thought about complaining, but then my husband, after taking his first bite of his breakfast sandwich, said \"taste this bacon, it is the saltiest bacon I have ever eaten.\"  OMG, what an understatement!  It tasted like they rolled the bacon in salt, fried it, and then rolled it in more salt and slapped it on an egg sandwich. 8.  Hubby complained... I decided not to complain about my asbsent bacon.  They offered to make him another (he requested sausage instead) but the whole process took so long, my husband finally cancelled the order.  We were in there well over an hour by this time. 9. The older guy (maybe this is David or the manager) was very apologetic, offered to take it off the bill and wrap up the new sandwich to go, but hubby decided he was probably better off not taking a chance.",

    "text": "I can't imagine I am even talking about the same restaurant that some of the other reviews describe.  Driving down Scottsdale Road looking for a breakfast spot, we noticed a young lady holding a sign advertising David's, so we went around the block and went in.  Sunday morning, 9:30am.  There were quite a few customers seated.  First impression was...this must be good!  NOT!!! No one greeted us.  We took the last booth available. (still other tables available) After at least 10 minutes a young wait person asked if we wanted coffee.  We said yes, and cream please.  Soon heard the next booth being told there was no coffee available...it was brewing.  Coffee arrived maybe 10 minutes later....sans cream.  Asked for cream again.  Nothing arrived.  We took some from an empty table. Finally the person came to take our order.  Most of the staff looked dirty, and needed to either throw away, or at least wash their shirts.  Disgusting.  Looked like they had been working in the kitchen overnight, they were splattered with food.  Not exactly appetizing. We saw many more groups of people come in....stand around waiting for direction to a table, or at least be spoken to.  The staff seldom offered help, or even a hello.  I couldn't believe how many customers just turned around and walked out.   Finally...the food arrives.  My waffle had a blob of frozen butter sitting on top.  The syrup was ice cold.  The 2 eggs (over easy) had been fried to a crisp...the edges were brown and burnt.  The bacon was overdone and cold. My dining partner had an omelet which he described as 'just okay'.  The potatoes served with it were described as just nasty, greasy. The table of 4 ladies that sat behind us waited forever...with no water or coffee...but finally got to order some breakfast.  A burrito was delivered to their table with no salsa.  I heard the customer ask for salsa....twice.  Never did arrive.  Another lady was complaining her toast never arrived. Server said he couldn't remember what kind of toast she wanted.  The lady said just bring me SOMETHING please.  Never did see toast arrive. We could see that many of the other diners were very unhappy with their experience also. Other tables were complaining because there was never any coffee ready. Can they only brew ONE pot at at time??  For a restaurant full of breakfast customers?? And they needed more staff. I made the comment this place needs to be featured on the TV show...Restaurant Impossible. This is not the way to run a restaurant.  Really. This is \"season\" in downtown Scottsdale!! People come here to spend money!! Very disappointing to see a restaurant floundering....that could and should have turned those table probably 3 times in the time we spent there....if it were managed and staffed properly. When we paid our check and walked out, I noticed we had been sitting in there almost 2 hours.  No....we will not be going back to David's again.",

First off, all of their mexican food is grossly overpriced and their delivery takes FOREVER, but their burgers were good and they delivered to our work so we still ordered.

Today I have OFFICIALLY HAD ENOUGH!!! We called in our order (keeping it as simple as possible), they have stopped carrying Mr. Pibb (which is my friend's fav) and talked to me like I was an idiot about it. FOR ONCE I was given a short & reasonable estimated delivery time... Then my phone rang and I was told that my order would have to be picked up if we still wanted it & they were under new management and will no longer be delivering to our office b/c it's too far away... Meanwhile another group JUST ordered from them on Monday! And our whole office gives them a LOT of business and they just dumped us like that? Nope... Never again...",

By now my daughter was hungry and everyone else in our party said, they could have a \"snack\".  We had coupons that Kevin N. had picked up so we were good to give David's a shot.  I was kinda torn between nachos and a Texas Burger.  I waffled but when it came time to order I went with the burger.  My daughter had a hot dog.  The Texas Burger is like the Carl's Jr. Western Bacon Cheese Burger which is one of my favorite fast food burgers.  Except this was a real pattie that looked like it had been shaped by human hands.....not shaped by a round or square cookie cutter.  And it tasted like a real burger should.  The bacon was crispy, cheese was melty, and the onion rings were crisp.  This was a good burger in my book.  The fries were crispy on the outside...just the way I like them and fluffly on the inside.  My daughter gave the thumbs up to her hot dog and devoured the whole thing.  My companions enjoyed their food as well.  The one drawback I would say is that the service was slow.  We waited for our drink order to be taken and the waited for our drinks.  Our drinks were not refilled very quickly.  It was not super busy when we were there so maybe they were short staffed, I don't know.  Will I go back...yes, because the value was there.  It was a good burger for the price, with or without the coupon.",

    "text": "The perfect storm of circumstance, opportunity and Yelp Talk all came together today:)  The resulting irresistible mountainous wave of food based desire pushed me down the street, and back to David's Hamburgers & Mexican Food:)  I've been there several times since I wrote the original review and I will submit that there aren't many better spots for a burger, vanilla malt, or chicken mole` in Scottsdale (and I think I would bet money on the fact there aren't any other places where you could get all three in the same lunch order:)  Today was special, I saw a talk thread started by Samantha O, asking about chili, and remembered (that's right...so good I remembered it:) a chili-size I had there a couple of months ago...chili-licious:)  I also ran my morning route along the canal (6 miles, didn't get mugged, decapitated or any of the other things that are rumored to happen to unsuspecting canal joggers...perhaps it's because I'm a suspecting canal jogger:)...at any rate, I was sorely in need of a retox:)  And Pure is closed (another 1/2 written review, down the drain...oh well:) and it was probably too early to have a cocktail at Brackin's (even though it appears they are now open at noon! :-)  So I thought, \"OK, I'll take the bullet and try the bowl of chili at David's, to see if it's really that good\"...that's right, I threw myself on the chili bowl so you, my fellow Yelpers, would not have to...  You're Welcome!  David's chili is as good as the rest of their offerings...spicy, no-bean chili, plenty of heat for most flat-landers...if you are like me, you need a bit more heat and David's will hand you the bottle of hot sauce to get you there:-)  Add a vanilla malt and great and friendly service and what more could you ask for from your lunch?  Well, I'll tell you what more you could ask for...you could ask for Tom Jones in Las Vegas, circa 1974, playing on the 4 flat screens, in living, dazzling color...and that's what you would get...yup, \"Delilah\", She's a Lady\" and, interestingly enough, his version of \"Lucy in the Sky, with Diamonds\" serenaded me during my delightful lunch today:-)  Vintage Tom Jones, new art on the wall and consistently terrific food and service move the needle to 5 stars for David's:)",

    "text": "I was very hungry the other night, and decided to give Davids Original Hamburgers a try for delivery.  Now, I live in Scottsdale which, last time I checked, was in the United States where English is spoken, but maybe I'm wrong.  The person answering the phone spoke some kind of English, because I only had to ask him to repeat himself twice per question to understand him.  After repeating the name of my street 4 times, and spelling it for him twice, we finally got around to ordering.  I asked three times for a Philly Cheese Steak with fries, only because he didn't seem to understand a word I was saying.  I should have become suspicious when he asked me if I wanted steak on my fries...?????  Anyway, after hanging up, he calls back 5 minutes later and asks me to once again repeat my street name.  35 minutes later, a very nice young man showed up with my food.....and order of chili cheese fries.  I refused the order, as hungry as I was, but the delivery guy gave them to me anyway, no charge.  The only reason I ate about a quarter of them was that I was so hungry, but I'll tell you what, I wouldn't feed them to a starving dog.  They were pasty, soggy, and quite probably the worst thing I've ever eaten.  No thanks Dave, but here's a tip.....put someone on the phone that speaks English.",

    "text": "The biggest problem preventing this establishment from success is CURB APPEAL. It just looks REALLY cheap. The exterior window displays look absolutely wretched. Whoever created the visual elements that are supposed to lure in customers just has no imagination and seems unwilling to spend any money on improvements. Too bad, since the food is quite good. I took my son and we both were impressed. I'd actually passed this place hundreds of times before finally dropping in. And I think that revelation speaks for itself. It just lacks appeal. Once inside, the staff appeared somber, which always unnerves me. Were they surprised to see customers in the middle of the afternoon? I think they were!  Again, I must comment on design elements; this time, inside. The interior is as uninspired as the front window displays. The restaurant is long and desperately needs mirrors. It tries to look 50's, but just comes off like cheap plastic masquerading as chrome. Here's a tip: Drop the hideous yellow wall paint and draw your inspiration from authentic 50's dinners. Frame some original movie posters; get an old motorcycle in there. Do something!  Its sad really, this is the only diner in the area, so they're just hurting themselves. People want this place to succeed. They also do NOT have a liquor license, so that's gonna be an automatic deal-breaker for some patrons.",

Maybe that was David :-)  However, it is first and foremost a burger joint that appears to have branched out to mexican food as an after thought. The ambiance, decor, music (and the fact they have an old fashioned  \"fountain\" with stellar milkshakes) all remind me of a 50's style diner. No hint of Mexican there. But nothing wrong with that as the food is good. I'd return if I was downtown but would not drive out of my way for a meal.",

A couple of small menu and order discrepancies also happened. The decor is unappealing and the pre-packaged muffins on display at the bar didn't leave a good first impression.

Our food arrived within the delivery window and was both hot and fresh. The food portions were massive, we probably should have split the order of tacos! The tacos were served on a hard corn tortilla and topped with a mountain of chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado. The fries were tasty, the steak cuts were very well seasoned.

The bun was supper soggy in parts. The onion rings probably would've been good if they weren't cold when I got them.  And while we're discussing cold, the burger was cold too.   I ordered the food through the yelp website and delivery was confirmed for 3:01pm. I didn't receive it until almost 3:30. Perhaps that is why all of my food was cold. And it really baffles me that it took so long because the restaurant is literally within walking distance and  it isn't like I ordered it during the lunch rush. Don't confirm a specific delivery time if you can't arrive on time, and don't offer delivery if you can't deliver hot food.",

If you want a sense of what this place is like, imagine driving across the country and stopping in at a restaurant in a little town where the highway doubles as Main Street. That's where David's belongs.  The atmosphere is uber casual, long and thin with booths lined up against one wall and a soda fountain against the other. When you are the only bloke in the place, service better we fast and friendly and it was. Can't speak to if it were busy.  I had the basic burger. It was delicious. Easily the best I have had in forever. Why? Great ingredients: Tillamook cheese, hand pressed patty, generous fresh lettuce tomato and onion.  Far as I am concerned, burgers don't need to be fancy, just generous helpings of the best fixings. Unfortunately, point deduction for the fries. They were the kind with the coating to keep them crisp. Not a big fan.  So bottom line. I'd you are in Scottsdale and want a great old fashioned burger, this is your place",

I waited 20 min for a burrito and once I received it the meat was so burnt it was dark brown and crunchy. I returned the burrito and was offered another one. I should have just got my money back since the burrito they gave me still had bits of burnt asada, like they didnt clean the grill and gave me ground beef instead WITH ALL THE GREASE! It was fricken horrible a burrito with ground beef, grease and barely beans with nothing else I added into it as well as with what was supposed to be in it. Nope not worth the trip back for my money.",

I really like the Texas style burger with the onion rings and barbecue sauce, not to mention the crispy bacon!  My fiance liked it too and I even got him to eat some of the fries which he rarely does.  I haven't tried their Mexican food, but they also have breakfast which my coworker told me is fantastic.  They have delicious food at normal prices (unlike most of Scottsdale).  Definitely check this place out!",

We stopped in to get breakfast before going to a Giants game and had one of the worst dining experiences that we have ever had.   My daughter ordered a cheese omelet--what she got was a folded pile of greenish looking eggs with a bit of cheese melted on top.  My son ordered plain pancakes with nothing on them (he is very picky about his food) and got four pancakes smothered with powdered sugar.  The waitress (who was wearing a sloppy grease stained shirt) seemed oblivious to his distress.  I ordered huevos rancheros and got a plate with a slice of ham, two eggs, and some type of apple concoction all smothered with beans with a cup of covered canned salsa on the side.  Yuck  The four gentlemen at the table next to us were so exasperated by the poor service and their mixed up orders that after trying to communicate with the staff ended up just leaving (they paid of course).  Maybe breakfast isn't their strong suit, but if that is the case, they shouldn't serve it.",

My eggs bacon and potatoes were covered in banana    Juice. My French toast looked dry and unappetizing. The cheese steak was on regular bread and it was basically just one giant piece up steak not even cut up with the bone still in it.  To make the matter worse it took them almost 40 minutes to deliver my food. I will never order from them again which is sad because I use to recommend them to all my friends and family.",

No, you cant add peanut butter, chipotle mayo, gruyere cheese or artichoke hearts, but if you are looking for an outstanding double cheeseburger with no frills under $9, this is the place.

Normally they are very prompt with delivery, however, there have been a couple of times when we had to wait A VERY LONG TIME for our food.  Today it took almost 2 hours.  Needless to say, the food was cold, limp, soggy and disgusting.  The reason I'm writing this review is because both times I've called them to complain and they just simply don't care.  There has been no offer to replace the food, or discount the food or anything.  A very trite and insincere apology was all that was offered.  I will NEVER order from this restaurant again and I will NEVER recommend them to the hundreds of people in the corporate complex in which I work that are always looking for a restaurant to deliver them lunch.",

After seeing the mixed reviews for this place I was skeptical ordering a burger but decided to go for it and went with the Guacamole Burger and Deluxe Oreo Malt.  For delivery this was a solid burger. I was happy with my choice. The guacamole was pretty good. It was hard to tell if it was freshly prepared at the restaurant or store bought. If it was store bought it was of higher quality. I love avocado/guacamole and I can't stand most store bought/pre made guac. The burger was good size and well proportioned. There was a good ration of bun to meat to toppings. The lettuce and tomato was fresh and the meat was slightly pink in the middle and tasty. I love burgers but they need to be well proportioned and not have a huge bun or tons of lettuce to make it look big. This was done right. Next time I'd go with no mayo. It just doesn't need it as it's already a juicy burger. The fries were ok, nothing too special but decent fries I gladly ate. The Oreo malt was pretty solid. A good blend of oreo and vanilla and a good size which I was expecting for $4.25. I'd order from here again",

A group of us filled two booths and we so we had two waitresses. I was sad to hear that the waitress for the other table was awful. Everything took forever and at one point she was nowhere to be found. The waitress at our table was ok. The food wasn't anything to write home about, not even the fries were that great. You wouldn't be missing anything by not eating here.",

I was hungry for a burger and googled burger joints. There was many to chose from and decided to give David's hamburger a try. As soon I walked in I was greeted very professionally. Although it wasn't that busy since it was closer to close they sat me and said if I'd like they would let me eat my food there even tho it was so close to closing time. The food was amazing hot fresh and my drink was never empty. I'd for sure would eat here again and recommend this place no doubt. Also my waitress Alexis even with trying to do closing details she still was able to wait on me and make sure I was good. Highly highly recommend this place if I already didn't say so.",

So I came back in another 20 minutes and it was ready, but incomplete. It's frustrating to wait 45 minutes in total for one pretty simple breakfast meal. The two employees who were there were very nice but they definitely need to get some faster BOH employees or asses that waiting time.",

The wait staff, in fact, look very proud to be there & will make you feel like their guest rather than just some customer. They have new happy hour specials, a grab & go station if you're on the run. I guess they do deliveries as well for your convenience. Keep up the fantastic work guys!",

Today a coworker and I decided to give it a shot and dine in, we order in the office all the time and love the food. When we first arrived we were told we could seat ourselves but every table was dirty. an employee came by and cleaned the table we wanted to sit at and then took our drink order. The same girl then took our order a few minutes later we asked for  separate checks and ordered our lunch.  We waited close 30 min for our orders consisting of chicken Fajitas for my friend and, a slice of Cheese cake for me. She did not bring the extra plate my coworker requested or the side of sour cream she ordered, and beyond that she also did not refill our drinks. We finally asked the other employee working if he could bring us the requested items. He got our servers attention and she finally got the items. She had been busy talking on her cell phone and be bopping around she only had one other table it was pretty dead in there actually. When she did she finally noticed our cups needed to be refilled she refilled them with the wrong beverages my friend was drinking Coke and Got a refill of Ice tea. I finally asked for our check because if we didn't get it soon we would be late back to work, big Shocker she did not do separate checks as requested. Really she may have been the worst server I have ever had. I am beginning to wonder if that is just the way it is when you dine in at Scottsdale restaurants, two times this week I went out for lunch near my work and both times it was worse than the other.    Now the food as always was really tasty but the service was so piss poor I can honestly say I will never dine in again.  delivery only !!!!",

    "text": "On Saturday mornings, we like to hit up the Old Town Farmer's Market and then get some breakfast.  Our usual joint was booked and we thought we would try something new.  From the outside, David's Hamburgers looked like a good place to try.  Stepping inside, was quite different, but not in a bad way.  They feature an authentic Yodeler from Branson, MO, and have her posters everywhere, along with a 50's style theme.  It works for what it is, a hamburger joint, right? Our problems started from the moment we walked in the door. The restaurant had one other patron, sitting at the counter, and there were 7 of us, four adults and three kids. My mom, daughter and I arrived first, ordered our coffee and OJ and waited for the others.  They strolled in about 10 minutes later.  We didn't see a server for at least 20 minutes.  At this point, there are more guests walking through the door, looking to fill their hungry bellies.  Our server finally notices we have added to our group and we give her our entire order, as we didn't know when she might come back.  I could see she did not have a lot of help, so I gave her a break, understanding her being flustered.  We found entertainment with the Yodeler, and the kids weren't losing it...yet. An hour and fifteen minutes after we showed up, the food arrived in two orders, 10 minutes apart. It was cold and not very good.  My pancakes had turned rubbery and the sausage was overcooked to almost burnt, but my eggs were undercooked.  It was the same around the table.  Complaining, once I grabbed a manager, did no good.  He took my mom's plate of biscuits and  gravy back and microwaved it, as if it was normal. He never offered to take the food I clearly couldn't eat off of my bill. If this is the type of service they are offering, I'm not buying...ever again. I was surprised to see such disregard for customer service and in Old Town Scottsdale?",

    "text": "3.5  While I'm almost a fan, I should have paid better attention to the name of the restaurant when ordering.  Had it been Julio's Mexican Food & Other Stuff, my order would have been a wise choice.  But instead I ordered a carne asada quesadilla made by David who specializes in hamburgers.  In all fairness to David, it was not bad.  I'm not a big quesadilla person, but the Mexican plates seemed to large for me to consume and expect to walk around the arts festival afterward.  And if I can't take it home, I'm inclined to stuff it down.  I didn't care for the meat in the quesadilla (not the seasoning, but the actual flavor of the meat itself was odd), but it was perfectly buttery and toasty and full of cheese and veggies as well.  My husband's hamburger, however, looked great and I was full of envy as I watched him finish it in record time.  That envy quickly turned to resentment as he sampled my quesadilla and remarked \"yep, mine's better.\"  He would pay for his insensitivity later that afternoon.  I like that they will add flavorings to your soft drink, but my Cherry Coke needed more cherry flavoring and the addition of a cherry would be nice.  I do love that this restaurant has not be redesigned to fit into the trend of turning \"Old Town\" into North Scottsdale, from the big counter on one side to the vinyl booths on the other.  I just think I'll still with burgers and shakes.  Well, who am I kidding?  I'll order David's Mexican food again.  I can't turn down anything in a tortilla.",

Besides the two servers who could have cared less that we were there, that is.  The restaurant itself, in my humble opinion, should be painted, totally aired out and present itself as a sports bar or burger joint. The combination of mexican food and burgers is odd, and if you ask me (which you didn't but I'm telling you anyway) it just doesn't sell. Do one or the other and do it well.    The inside smelled heavily of grease, and we actually smelled like it after we left the place. Ick!  The 60's motif just doesn't cut it, and neither does the obnoxious yellow paint.   However, the food is the draw, and the burgers were really good (and inexpensive, considering). I'd go back for a hangover burger, but have to keep my sunglasses on and febreeze in my purse...",

She over priced me on the special but she blamed it on the computer & when she went to change the bill to the correct price she came & it had not taken off the extra money on the special which she specifically said it had. Even though she apologized, she did not try to make it right at all.  We told her to make sure to NOT charge card for the first wrong price & she assured us she did not. Today my mother checked & she DID charge us both times! The food sucked! The service was worse and now she will not let us talk to the manager! She said she can not reverse the charges & all she can do is ask the manager on MONDAY to send us a check! Bull s*#@ !! I was a server for years & I know it's possible & I also know that she had to charge mom's card twice at the end of her shift! This is just unacceptable. Don't waste your time or money at this dive!",

The service was friendly, and I dig the 50's vibe they've got going on.  I'd definitely go here again.",

It's a great place for out of towners too...real old school diner feeling with malts and shakes.  Oh, and the chili fries are just like the ones from Coney Island in Detroit where I grew up!",

An Old Town experience, representing some of how it probably was in the 50's and 60's.  Kinda quaint, a little bit kitschy. They don't pretend to be something they're not!   People are very nice. There's a brother and sister who serve tables that are super! Has a family-run feel to it.  I discovered Paula last year. She is a world-class award winning yoddler, the real deal from Brandon, Mo. Now, I knew nothing about this music until Paula, and is not my fav genre still. But I have to say she followed her dreams, achieved accolades for her work, and has a passion for it that should put her naysayers to shame. Live music is never a bad idea.She reminded me of Dale Evans and Roy Rogers from when we we kids. And I surprised myself by knowing some of the songs! Like Willy Nelson, Tammy Wynette's Stand By Your Man.She does requests. It was fun for the whole family, all ages.  Overall, it makes for a unique old western experience, I think folks will enjoy!   Plus they deliver to the local area, great value!",

I was going to go for chili burger (I love my chili burgers) but because we hadn't eaten breakfast (this was 6 p.m. at night!), I instead went for the shrimp and avocado omelette - and contrary to another reviewer here, it was fresh, chock full of shrimp - in every bite - and delicious. In fact the only thing that was wrong was the burnt wheat toast but because the omelette was so good, it was easy to overlook it.  Plenty of great food - my parents who are finicky also enjoy their breakfasts - and our waitress was wonderful. I'd like to get back there soon and try their burgers and french dips.  From what I understand the owner is the son of the previous restaurant owners who ran a Kosher-style deli that was never open when we wanted our deli fix. The son (if that is who he is) has done good.",

If you are making a hamburger for the love of god please get a bun that is bigger than the burger!!! I hate it when the burger falls off the edge and you end up just eating half a burger patty...

The bonus is that they offer breakfast all day (apple waffles, chocolate chip pancakes, ect.), Mexican (my husband loved his carnitas tacos. they were huge and looked tasty) as well as Hamburgers.  I had a veggie burger with cheese fries.  A little bit of everything for anyone.  :)",

On the other hand, the server was very sweet, the iced tea was nicely brewed, my friend ordered a milk shake made with a slice of apple pie that was so good it made me cry, and the grilled chicken taco salad that my other friend ordered looked AWESOME.

So, the next time we ordered, I specifically mentioned the ranch and the fact that they'd forgotten it before, and I asked them to please remember it this time.  Was it in the bag??  No!  Another time, I ordered a breakfast burrito and specifically asked for sour cream and salsa and told them to be sure not to forget it...and they forgot it!!  I call and complain, and the person I talk to sounds like he's 20 years old and couldn't care less that I'm complaining.  I did get a credit once, but no other time has it been mentioned.    It's a shame that the delivery service sucks so bad because the food is actually very good.  Their burgers are great, and their milkshakes are to die for.  But, next time I order delivery, I'm going to tell them that, if they mess anything up, I am never ordering from them again.  Four times in a row screwing it up is just ridiculous.

Also, the \"potatoes\" were just greasy fries cut up into little squares.  It's incredible that they could get a spinach and mushroom scramble wrong.  There were four of us in total, and she did not offer any of us any re-fills on our drinks.  We had to flag her down and ask her several times.

I'm only giving it three stars because they've messed up my order a couple times and the food is good, not great but an excellent value regarding the amount of food you get for the price you pay. I usually go for the heavy \"Texas Burger\" donned with cheese, bacon, bbq sauce and onion rings with a side of fries.  Again, great value for the amount of food but the quality isn't top notch. I'm also a bit confused as to why they have a woman singing in there during lunch time. That would keep me from eating at their restaurant because it's both loud and a bit uncomfortable since the music she's singing is so out of style that I don't think my grandparents would even enjoy it. I'm sure they lady has a great time doing it and makes money with it, just not my taste.  If you're looking for cheap takeout with crispy fries and large burgers, hit up David's. They'll even deliver but it takes much longer for your food to arrive than if you were to call it in and pick it up. Plus, the one time I've had it delivered it all showed up soggy.",

    "text": "I've lived near Old Town Scottsdale for years and in all that time I've never really taken to the streets by foot, aside from a weekly visit to the Farmers Market. At first glance you ask yourself how many Indian jewelry shops can the area possibly sustain? Well the answer is, the turquoise market in Old Town seems to be doing quite well. So it was on a recent exploration trip that we happened upon David's Hamburger's and Mexican Food. So for me the idea of killer burger and tasty Mexican good is a match made in heaven, were talking major food groups here.   Tucked between 2 galleries, David's is a blink and you'll miss it kind of place, very unassuming and humble. Inside you won't be wowed by the interior design but what they do have is functional and comfortable. With TV's at both ends of the hall like space, you'll be entertained by performance videos of 50's era rock 'n roll.   I usually don't write much about soda pop, well never, but in this case the Cherry Coke ($1.95) was kind of special. When you order a Coke you can ask them to add a number of different flavorings from lemon and vanilla to chocolate and of course cherry. David's version is wonderfully fizzy and cuts through the richness of the upcoming meal.   Of all the ways Mexican style meat is prepared, the grilled taste of beef is my all time favorite. If you enjoy this as much as I do then Id suggest the Carne Asada Nachos ($8.59). A massive pile of crunchy tortilla chips is covered in grilled beef strips, melted cheese, guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. While basic, I ate most of them myself leaving my partner to scraping the cheese off of the plate. If you'd like salsa on your chips, be sure to ask them to bring you bowls of green and red salsa.   Now who doesn't like a big juicy hamburger? David's doesn't disappoint with David's Single ($5.99), say that 2 times fast. A 1/3lb patty topped with the usual suspects, then dressed with David's creamy sauce which to me was a thick version of Thousand Isle dressing, adding a layer of tangy goodness. Along side you have your choice of fries or you can choose to upgrade ($.99) to a mix of large deep fried onion rings and golden French fries. For dipping I a side of David's sauce did the trick in lieu of ketchup.   The Patty Melt ($7.25) is classic diner food. We're talking thick ground beef patty, melted cheese and grilled onions on your choice of grilled sourdough or rye bread. The wholesome grease from the beef patty and grilled onions is absorbed into the bread creating a creamy like texture, for me this is what a patty melt is all about. Of course the Guacamole Burger ($6.25) with its pepper jack cheese, bacon and guacamole is the marriage of Mexican and American influence.   If you're an early riser, David's also serves breakfast like Bacon Pancakes ($6.75) and Coconut Waffles ($6.25). Someone please pass the syrup. My only question, where is the breakfast burrito?",

    "text": "I don't know what the one or three star reviewers are talking about, but since we'll go back, maybe we'll find out.   My wife and I had a coupon and went there because we were starving and close.  The place smells, not like grease, but like good hamburgers.  It is bright, clean, and nicely decorated, but definitely casual, as expected. And the burgers are good.  I had David's burger and my wife had the deluxe.  The grilled burgers are very high quality and taste wonderful.  The ingredients are fresh.  The burgers and sandwiches come with a side of fries or coleslaw.  I had fries, and my wife tried the 'slaw.  She commented that the 'slaw tasted like they'd just made it with fresh ingredients.  It was fresh.  It didn't have as much character as some I have had before, but it was really good.  The fries tasted about as good as fries can get, my wife agreed.  They are not skinny fries like at McDonald's or In-n-Out, but regular-sized.  I thought they might be from fresh potatoes, so I asked.  Nope, they're frozen.  They're good.  While we dined, the waiter brought a tray with a huge, and wonderful looking taco salad to another table.  Maybe I'll try that next time.  And there will be a next time.  The only thing I can't comment on positively was that there were no kids in there, but some were leaving as we arrived, and they left Harry Potter on the TVs the whole time, but never played background music.  We arrived there on a February Saturday night about 6:15.  I am still puzzling over why they weren't crowded.  A very good value for fresh-made food.",

Then, called to be asked where we lived on a couple occasions, as they got my address wrong and the driver was at a different location.  After all that, the food was cold. The bacon cheese fries were one huge blob of bacon bits and some cheese situation. The French dip as ok. May have been better if it wasn't cold. My rolled tacos where super soggy and left much to be desired.  Not impressed!",

I also get the chili.. lemme tell ya, I ain't no chili expert, but David's does it right. It surely is delectable. And the prices are low! Can't beat it. Ha, beat it.  I would highly recommend this joint to ANYONE in Old Town or surrounding areas. You won't be let down.",

I've ordered delivery from here a few times and it's never good. I just got cheese fries and a burger and I can't even eat the burger because the bun is so soggy and same kent the fries. Both are soggy, cold and not edible.   I felt bad for the delivery guy so I still threw him a bad tip even though it took over a hour to get here when they told us 35 minutes.

Walking in, I was shocked to see how dead it was for a Saturday night and I'll admit I started to wonder if this place was going to be worse than my expectations but I took a seat. I like that they sell art from local artists but overall the decor looked pretty run down. Just needs a little sprucing up.   I ordered a Route 87 cheeseburger and added an egg. The description appeared to be my favorite burger from Jonny Rockets (coincidently named the Route 66) which I also add an egg to.   It arrived it was everything I hoped it would be. The taste was almost exactly like Johnny rockets. Yyuumm!! The fries were a bit cold but edible.   The highlight for me, however, was my waitress. She was attentive and so very friendly, checking on me frequently , ensuring my coke was always full. In fact, she kindly offered a to go cup as I was leaving. Score! I wish I had gotten her name because she was a star.",
