It's one of the best restaurants I've been to in PHX! But today, after not coming here for a month, I wanted my fix of some good ol sushi from Harumi. I was very excited and been looking forward to it after I landed. When I came in, I noticed it wasn't the regular people around (there was this very nice Korean lady that was always very sweet whenever I visited). Instead, I was greeted by this guy who sounded like he didn't want to be there. To make things worse, he couldn't get one of my friend's orders correct and had to repeat it several times. And now, we're still waiting for our food after some time and he has yet to check up on us. Sorry Harumi, I really liked you guys, but this was just awful customer service. You still make great sushi.",

    "text": "Super delicious and extra refreshing sushi place in Phoenix. I usually get a little hesitant when sushi places get a little creative with their sushi and by that I mean not using the right rice or drenching a roll in too much mayo, but this place was creative in their presentation. I loved the black rice in my roll. It gave it a super soft texture and a different twist. The Oasis roll was my all time favorite. It was wrapped in cucumber so the water of the cucumber added extra freshness to the roll. All the seafood I had here was fresh as well. Being in a dessert it's hard to gauge how good seafood will be but it was super great here.",

    "text": "Harumi Sushi is by far my new favorite place to grab sushi here in the Valley.  I went with a group of 10 people, and not one person had a bad food experience.  To start, the rice is purple.  Yes.....PURPLE!  Apparently, it is a black rice that turns purple once cooked and is filled with extra antioxidants and other components that are good for you.  And trust me, even if it wasn't good for me I'd still be asking for it.  I don't know what it is, but it is phenomenal!  The dishes we shared were the Ahi Stack, Spicy Scallop roll, and Salmon Sashimi.   Holy moly; the Ahi Stack was unlike anything I've ever eaten.  I thought it was a roll, but instead it is a mountain of ahi tuna, crab and spicy sauce on top of a mound of purple rice topped with fresh avocado and roe.  We inhaled it, and will definitely get it again.  And the salmon is the most buttery, fresh salmon I have ever had in the valley.  They top it with their homemade fresh wasabi, which was also fabulous!  I docked 1 star because when we went to pay there was a lot of confusion and some people received their bills, some didn't, some didn't get their cards back for awhile.....it was a cluster, but definitely forgivable.  If you love sushi, I definitely say run, Run, RUN to Harumi!!",

    "text": "Came in here on a Saturday night around 830-9PM and although there was a wait, it was fairly short and we were seated quickly. The restaurant itself isn't extremely big, but it's very cozy and I enjoyed the more intimate ambience.   During our visit, we decided on the OMG roll, the Oasis roll, and the H3 roll. What's really neat about this restaurant is that they use purple rice and it definitely gives the place a different feel. I forgot exactly how the purple rice was created, but I believe it is supposed to be a healthier substitute, which I appreciate, and regardless of the different rice color, all the sushi tasted delicious! The OMG roll is definitely one any visitor must try because its presentation is really intriguing and entertaining. It comes out wrapped in aluminum foil lit on fire and it certainly enhances one's trip here. Not only that, but the flavor of the sushi is great and it was definitely my favorite choice amongst the 3. The other choices were also delicious though! Additionally, we got the toro nigiri and the toro melts in your mouth. We ended up getting green tea mochi ice cream for dessert as well, which was the perfect touch to end the meal.   In addition to the food tasting great, the service was even more phenomenal. Right from the start, we felt greeted and wholeheartedly welcomed. Our server, the food runners, and I believe he was one of the owners of the restaurant (?) were all very kind, helpful, on top of things, and truly made our experience there nothing short of amazing.  If I'm ever in Phoenix, I'd definitely visit again. I like you, Harumi Sushi. I like you a lot.",

Tonight I had the Oh My God roll and the Harumi Roll. Both were incredible. The lady even let me heat up the Oh My God roll myself!! Great setup and ambiance.  THE HIGHLIGHT of the meal for me was definitely the Tuna Nigiri! I have to get it every time I'm here!  Plus the wasabi is fresh and spicyyyy (not in a bad way).

Purple rice was a cool touch - tougher than your usual sushi rice (reminded me of brown rice texture). Our sashimi appetizer sampler was pretty good and fresh!   Ambience: Felt very welcomed when we first walked through the door. cute decor, cozy atmosphere.  Other: I am on the search for an inexpensive and fresh sushi place since I've moved back to Phoenix. I'd like to come back to try other rolls for sure!   Obviously parking is not free since it's downtown, but it was very inexpensive. I paid $1.50 for one hour right around the corner.",

The H3 is at the other end of the scale and more subtle that the Oh my God, but equally as good. The contrasting red fish eggs and bright avocado colours alone are worth getting the H3 dish.

    "text": "TLDR; Friendly staff, great atmosphere, amazing value for price, and even better quality food! Will definitely return!  Wow! So glad my first time was on a holiday! No line, no wait, and still excellent service! Got there late-ish around 8:15PM and parked in the lot in the back. $5 parking/hr during business hours. Max $15.   *Pro tip: For parking you can download the mobile app (Parkmobile) ahead of time in case you don't want to pay on site or if there's a crowd.*  First thing I remember smelling as I walked in was the tempura batter. Also, I was surprised there was no conventional sushi bar. However the chefs were very friendly and still greeted every customer who came in, ordered, and left. I felt very welcome and appreciated for my patronage.  *Pro tip: Place is small, so preferable for a small group (6 or less) or  dinner date possibly pre/post orpheus*  Was feeling indecisive but very hungry. Opted for the Omakase (chef's choice) and hot green tea (which wasn't as strong as I was expecting since I didn't let the tea steep very long). Multiple staff members offered to refill my tea with more hot water throughout the course of my meal, which I found charming, but ultimately unnecessary since I don't tolerate really hot beverages well.  The personalized order took about 15 minutes to prepare, but it was truly worth the wait. Not only was it picture worthy, but it was of impecable quality. Had a large variety of fish, preparation styles, textures, and flavors. However each order had one thing in common.  They were all exceptionally delicious.   *Pro tip: If you have dietary restrictions or are food texturally challenged, you can still order Omakase, just tell them ahead of time!*  While eating I took notice of the decor and entertainment. The walls were lined with photographs and decorations that had probably seen better days. There was a korean variety show on the television but the sound was off and subtitles were scarse...so unless you read Korean, don't expect to understand/follow much of what you see.  At the end of my meal the chef asked what I thought, if I was satisfied, and then politely thanked me again. Payment was seemless  and without error despite not being itemized. I would have liked to have gotten dessert, but they were closing...and this way gives me one more excuse to come back soon!",

I won't lie - I was a bit concerned about the strange looking rice, but I am glad I took the chance. I didn't leave a morsel left, because the rolls were just that good. The sashimi was even more delightful with no fishy odor like other places. OMG Roll was the best one we tried this time. I'm excited to go back.",

The service is quick and attentive.  I usually get the bento lunch special, which is a great value and very well apportioned... one could probably make two meals of it with a to-go-box.    It's a bit off the beaten path from the main drag, but it offers one of the best lunch values of downtown.  They don't have a prime location or over the top decor, which allows them to give the lunchgoer a good value. The taste is excellent and the food is fresh and well prepared.  They are staffed well so there is hardly a wait even if it is busy.  I've noticed they play 90s music sometimes, which gives the place a quaint ambiance.  This has become one of my go-to spots downtown.",

They serve sushi with black rice which is a neat little fun distinction, but I honestly couldn't taste any difference from usual sushi rice. The OhMyGod roll is a definite must and was delicious! The staff are nice but they were like chickens running around with their heads cut off being so busy. It's a little noisy, but overall a great little place.",

Only thing that we would advice the owner : customers can everything you say, talking in front of us with a waiter about last nights problems I front of us wasn't a good idea. We do understand that things happen but we are here to enjoy food and 1st time experience and we really don't need to know all the details.

The best deal of the night was the spicy sashimi salad! For only $9 bucks, what a steal! It had plenty of tuna and salmon and the sauce that was mixed in was a perfect blend flavors with the right about of spice. The owner/chef did come around and tell us that if it was too spicy, to let him know next time. I also ordered the ramen with shrimp tempura which was ok. Don't expect it to be like an ippudo or legit Japanese ramen. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place!

Everything came out very quickly and everything was great, especially the Tuna Tataki, seared salmon, Spider Roll, and real wasabi.  This is a no-frills, great value, delicious place to grab sushi in downtown Phoenix.  Next time, we want to try the OMG Roll, which is served flaming at your table.",

Had to wait a bit for several empty tables to be cleared off before we could sit and our hot sake went missing, but all was forgotten when our order was (quickly) up... The sushi is gorgeous.  Tuna and salmon were some of the best I've had and the purple rice was great. If we were local, I'd make this place part of my weekly routine.  Go, go, go!

They have a lot of wait staff and workers within the restaurant but you just get your food rather quick and that's about it till you ask for the check.          The tempura items are pre-battered and precooked. They are then refried, salted and served. Everything was so salty. Did not use any soy sauce. Typical teeny tiny shirmp that are the cheapest available... You can do better at Costco...      Nigiri Sushi isn't cold but served rather room temp. The horribly composed roll that comes with it was hastefully put together is mushy and I guess a good portion of fish within but it's leftover bits and pieces.      Purple rice that's in everything and everywhere might catch some people but I don't think it added a thing to the sushi minus being a different color.      Spicy tuna roll was the best I tasted but not worth coming back with.      They really push you out the door if your there anywhere near closing. Almost to the point of embarrassment. I apologized to the people I was with on behalf of the staff. We weren't anywhere near the last party of out of the door and this was before 10pm. The cart they push around to collect dishes is gross and should stay put out of sight.",

The seating sucked since I felt we were tucked away in a corner and It took a while for anyone to come ask us for drinks and take our order.

It might be because they have that weird purple rice I don't know I'm not going to claim to be partial to the fun colored food but anyway the sushi is on point I'm always happy with whatever they come out to do. The people that work there sheezus love them they they crack jokes and clown I like people that are in a little soft like they'll look real silly song borderline stuff to you sometimes but they're being funny so I love it. but back to the food the food is always on point it's one of my favorite sushi places I will say this if you're going there and let's say you go there with a date let's say it runs you 40 bucks the penny if you're doing appetizers you're doing different roles you're grabbing some Las Vegas rolls you're grabbing some of that weird squid stuff in the things they set on fire but it honestly your date will be very happy with his choice of location. It's not super big but it's roomy when you're sitting down you're not going to be elbowing anyone I like how they did the spacing there I also really like the atmosphere to it to the something about the lighting I really appreciate their choices. But once you get my favorite spot I was going to givea 10 out of 10 if I could because I have never had a bad experience going there and some I am somebody who did not like sushi for a pretty long time and this is actually the spot that switched me over anyway once again love it I recommend going to",

Not only is the fish quality good (which I've come to find is rare in AZ), but the wide selection of roles is wide and they come in generous portions!!!!  I was a little worried that the black rice that they use exclusively would be too heavy and texture-y like brown rice but was pleasantly surprised. Everything was so tasty and the service was fast/friendly.   Will be coming back :)",

Let me start by saying the service was outstanding! They accommodated our party of 8 with a baby with no fuss whatsoever. Young was our waitress and she was very attentive but not overwhelming.   I love how fresh everything tasted and how everything was flavored. It wasn't overwhelmingly sauced but enough that you don't need to dip in soy sauce.   The spicy crab salad was a pleasant surprise and a nice start to the meal. I thought is would come out in a bowl but instead it came out as a roll and I loved it! Very refreshing.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of the rolls because we sure didn't and we ordered almost half the menu. Fish is very fresh!",

They are great at making recommendations from their menu.  My new favorite is the Ahi Tower.  It's beautiful and packed with flavor!    If you are in the downtown area I would recommend Harumi.  It's not as swanky as some of their competition, but the fish here tastes fresher and service is more attentive.  One thing to note: the rice they use is purple-colored.  If you read the explanation on the monitor you learn that it's a super-food.  I love this concept!  I have taken visitors here on several occasions and they've all ended up loving Harumi!",

I wish I would have got the gentlemen's name, he had longer hair and was older then the other servers, because he was the SWEETEST to our darling daughter! We had a saki bomb and he randomly came over and brought her a special orange Japanese soda that had a marble in it, just to make her feel special too, and she had such a kick out of that!! I had the California roll and the shrimp tempura roll and my husband tried the chefs special plate where they decide for you what they bring out. Everything was really fresh, a must try!!",

DO NOT BE TURNED OFF - everything was SO GOOD!  Dinner for 3 was only $60 before tip, and really good quality.  We ordered:  - ahi tuna taco - the best thing we had, order it! Really great flavors! - caterpillar - all the rolls are white and black rice mixed together to make purple rice. Really good texture and flavor! - shrimp tempura - greate shrimp flavor - Cali crunch - really good texture  - spicy tuna - I usually love spicy tuna but was not crazy about this - gyoza - really crispy!  Really nice service! Definitely must do",

The service was great as well - they were nice enough to help us so we did not over order (which we often do!) I highly suggest Harumi!!",

The atmosphere is relaxed and enlivening, adding flavor to a mostly greyscale, vaporous, and boring downtown. Now let's get serious! THE SUSHI: the sushi is made with a purple rice, tastes delightfully fresh, and yes, it is delicious. I will be back, many times.",

This is not your gourmet sushi restaurant; they serve traditional and a few fun rolls in a simple, yet appealing style. Their grab and go sushi also makes for a quick and healthy lunch option for employees in the downtown area! I ordered a lunch bento box with bulkogi beef and they loaded my plate up with fried rice, house salad, veggies and tofu! Not really the type of bento I'm used to but it was a good sized portion and really tasty!",

Pros: Food came out fast even though it was very busy. Convenient location if you're downtown.  Cons: Food was bland, nothing special. It's not a traditional sit down restaurant where you have a server, it's self serve after you stand in a long line. Tiny and cramped dining area (lots of people standing room only). Really small and crummy old bathroom.  We came here based on the great reviews but I think I went to a different restaurant, haha.  Probably won't try again.",

First impression was that there was only purple rice, yummy but did not appear to be as sticky. We had a philly roll, one with a cucumber outside and the ahi tower. The cucumber roll was very refreshing but pretty wide hence difficult to eat in one piece. The ahi tower was actually not a roll. It was a pile of sushi roll ingredients. It had a good spicey kick to it, it was delish but difficult for me to eat with chop sticks. Overall very nommy and therefore a busy place. The shouting of the staff for birthdays and closing time was a bit off-putting though.",

In addition to the nigiris, we go three other rolls. they were good, but the spicy mayo sauce kind of over powered the all the other flavors. Despite the over powering sauce I was able to taste the seaweed paper, so that was uncommon from my experiences at other restaurants.  Service: The service was good, but they seem disorganized. After we order the food. the chef kept coming to our table to check what has been delivered, and this happened 2-3 times (we ordered 4 things). We did come an hour before closing though, so that may be why.  Overall it was a very good experience. Definitely will come back again once I save up enough change for the parking meters.",

    "text": "Had a lunch here with some coworkers some of who have had their eye on this restaurant and had been wanting to try it. We went during a busy time of day so service was understandably slow. I had asked our server if they could make a spicy yellowtail roll in place of spicey tuna to which she said yes and scribbled something on our menu before taking it and giving our order to the chefs. When we were handed our sushi rolls I was given Spicey tuna instead of what I asked for, so I sat there waiting for a half hour before she had came by again and I brought it to her attention, she said okay and rushed off leaving the untouched roll at out table.   About 20 minutes later another serve came by to check on how we were doing and I had brought it to his attention as well that my order was wrong, he apologized and took the plate to return with the correct order. After he had left and I had heard him talk to or original server about the mistake (it's a very small place and we were seated right by the counter) she came to the table with our menu and an attitude saying that I had marked blah blah and that if I wanted yellow tail that should have written it on the bottom of the page and how I was wrong, she then shoved the paper in my face saying \"see you marked this when you should've done this\" (mind you it wasn't my handwriting nor my coworkers and she was the one scribbling on our menu) so it took about another half our of waiting before I got the correct roll which was just okay. When we were finally done and went up to pay a different employee took about 15 minutes to split our check (there was only 4 of us and we only ordered one item each except I had ordered edamame for the table.) I definitely wont be coming back. I get misunderstandings happen especially during a busy lunch hour, but when you're blatantly rude to me in front of people I work with I have to draw the line there.",

There is a line, but it goes by pretty quickly and worth the wait. Chef Juno is awesome and is always is good spirits! The Must try is the OMG roll!

They care about customers and they always have good service and food. I definitely recommend this place even if you guys live far away from downtown Phoenix. Harumi is the best!!!!",

The sushi is fresh and thick, the portions are generous, and the prices are a steal - I only wish my stomach was bigger so I could eat more.   We ordered the sashimi appetizer, 8 slices of salmon sashimi (excuse me may I have a lifetime supply, it was so delectable), the omakase (so so delicious, my first time trying toro and I swear my tastebuds have never experienced anything so divine), the H3 roll (hands down best roll I've had in a while), udon, and the lil green tea mochies for dessert.   10/10 would come again + the owner & staff are super adorable and fun, too :')",

    "text": "It's rare that I can convince my husband to eat sushi in Arizona, but on a recent double date, he gave in and joined me and our friends Andrew and Jules for a quick bite at Harumi Sushi before we headed to a show downtown.  I called ahead to make sure we could get seated and was told they don't take reservations or call-ahead, but we took our chances and luckily were seated within a few minutes of arriving.  (It was around 6:30pm on a Saturday night and we just beat the crowd!)  Jade was our server and was awesome... We ordered edamame, veggie tempura, and a bunch of sashimi and sushi to share family style.  I had a seaweed salad and I believe a few miso soups were ordered as well.  The boys enjoyed some saki while Jules and I went with iced green tea, which as really refreshing.  We were impressed with the quality of the sashimi (yellowtail and salmon) and the forbidden / purple rice they use in the rolls is tasty and unique with plenty of health benefits per the signage around the restaurant.  Prices are reasonable and service is quick and friendly.  It's exciting to see how much the downtown restaurant scene has exploded over the years.  There are plenty of options to choose from, and Harumi is definitely a solid choice -- especially if you're craving sushi.  Looking forward to return visits (and likely my husband will join me now too.)  Either way, I'll be back!",

I have been on such a sushi kick lately and am so glad I found a place I can get my fix in. Not only do I feel this is one of the more authentic places I have been to in Arizona but it is so affordable which is an amazing find for a sushi restaurant.   I always order their miso soup and philly roll however a lot of my friends have gotten several different rolls that I have had the pleasure of trying. I even took my grandpa here when he came to visit who is from Hawaii and gets fresh sushi everyday, and even he approved! I really love this place as well for the black rice that they make each roll with. I had no idea that there was such a health benefit to black rice until now and am so glad that I gave this place a shot.   Harumi you have a loyal customer in me and I cannot wait to go back soon!",

For the other they did make a Chef's Special yellowtail roll for me just because I asked if they had a yellowtail roll and they didn't, that one was pretty delicious.   The wait time was a little too long, both on the ordering end and on waiting for the check. For some reason they were unable to just bring the check to me and kept serving new people who kept walking in the door, so eventually I had to just get up and go wait in the takeout line to pay (even though they'd told me to sit back down and wait), I guess they were just dust.",

I have to admit that I'm not the biggest Sushi fan, but this is as good as it gets (better than I ever anticipated). Food is fantastic, at a great price point, and the staff-- well, they are out of this world! Our waitress went out of her way to recommend gluten free options for me and the chefs were all right on top of it, even stopping by my table to ensure I was Ok. You often hear the chef line calling out dishes as they go... \"Oh. my. God!!\" For the OMG role, \"thank you\" to all visitors leaving their establishment. What a treat of an experience while in Phoenix! I will definitely recommend to others!",

Everything was decently priced, and I was surprised that the roll combo with sashimi came out to only $16, when normally that much sashimi alone is that price. They were also thick slices of fish and came with some fresh wasabi on top. The Chirashi came with their famous black rice and it was yummy and sort of tasted like brown rice to me. Supposedly it's better for you and is filled with loads of antioxidants! For those less adventurous, sorry but they actually don't serve white rice at all! The Chirashi also came with the larger fish eggs which I thought were way too salty and ended up removing them. Overall, their servings were large, decently priced and delicious. Only downside is the parking and you'll have to park at a meter, but that's Phoenix for you!",

    "text": "When reading the yelp reviews here, Harumi seemed a bit polarizing, so it took me awhile to finally try this place out. We came in on a weekend evening and didn't expect the place to be so packed. We didn't know what to expect, but we wanted a good sushi experience. After looking at the menu and pictures, we ordered the Omakase and was surprised that it was filling for two people for a sensible price. Each piece of nigiri met my expectations, melting in my mouth, the sashimi portions were huge, and each was topped with real wasabi. The real wasabi is spicy with a nice kick to the nose. They used a perfect amount of rice. Not too much and not too little. The server would always refill our glasses and made sure everything was to our liking. We wrapped our dinner with mochi ice cream, which was soft, but chewy. As for flavors, they were only 3, mango, strawberry, and green tea when we visited. Sure this place gets crowded in the evenings (I recommend coming earlier before 6), but to have good sushi, I would definitely come back as this place is interesting, unique, and delicious.",

It's hard for me to fall in love with sushi here in the middle of the desert; but I was pretty wow'd by Harumi Sushi when we were here the other night. My favorite was a H3 Roll, ( ABSOLUTE favorite!) ; Black rice in a roll!!! Yes please. The spicy tuna; The salmon; and the OMG! Which is in foil and flamed and lit up at table. We over ordered , as we usually do from not being able to decide or simply wanting to sample so many different things. The servings here at Harumi are generous. It's probably best to not be like us and order as you consume! Every roll was fresh and came out to us fast. The  wait staff wow'd us with great, friendly service and from the kitchen they even seem to have a fun environment too. It's nice to dine in a place like that! Love the location but parking here is kind of a bear at times and another 'con' is the bathroom is in a weird place. Let's be honest, sushi in the desert is always 'weird' to someone or maybe anyone who lived in the Californ-I-A but this is legit and I am a fan!",

I explained to the waiter that I wanted my sushi not spicy.  I wrote it on the sushi and verbally confirmed with the waiter.  When my sushi arrived it had topping of wasabi (Japanese horseradish) on it.  I then had to argue with the waiter that yes, wasabi is spicy.  I told them they needed to redo my sushi not spicy as I requested.  I caught the looks from the sushi chefs and the waiters \"crazy lady\" look and shrug.  My \"not spicy please\" albacore tuna had an extremely spicy \"crust\" on the edges. Another argument, after which they took the tuna off the bill.  Sushi is excellent but I won't be eating dinner there again.",

I called to make sure they were open and they answered quickly! Plus one.  I eat sushi occasionally- not often. It needs to be done right, and in Arizona- that's tough.  My husband and I sat down, and seared salmon nigiri with a slight kick was placed at our table within minutes. We were so confused at first at their generosity! My husband and I aren't used to complementary service at restaurants, so that was an extra treat!  I love salmon, so I ordered some simple nigiri. He offered real Wasabi on the side. Omg. That IS real Wasabi!!  My husband got the Oasis roll, and ohhhhhh boy, was that a hit! Cucumber wrap?! Gimme! SO refreshing! The table next to us asked us what wrap we got, because that's how unique it is!  We also split the fried dumplings, gyoza, and they were SO delicious.  Service, food and atmosphere was amazing. Prices were also very good for the quality, in my opinion.",

Not only did we get a personal visit from Chef Juno (he even gave my mom his phone number! 911-911 baby), the food was absolutely delicious.

After moving from California and trying 6 different sushi restaurants in the area we thought we were doomed to mexican food and pizza forever. I literally said this was the last place i would try sushi and if it wasn't good then I would throw in the sushi towel.  OMG! DELICIOUS! AUTHENTIC! ATTENTION TO DETAIL! FRESH!!  The owner/sushi chef was so entertaining and really takes care of his customers. Everyone in the restaurant was brought a complimentary lightly seared tuna tataki with ponzu and thanked by him personally for coming in. I was hesitant to eat sushi with black rice but I am officially converted. While white rice has that chewiness and bounce back to it, the black \"purple\" rice was tender with the just the right amount of resistance to complement the melt in your mouth buttery fish. It felt way less heavy than white rice and the fact that its healthier makes me feel a little better about stuffing my face with sushi.  GET THE FRESH WASABI! So worth the $2. I am officially spoiled. There is no going back to that powdered crap now. Its got such a fresh bite to it and it doesn't overpower the sushi like normal powdered wasabi does. We also got the Sex and the City roll, spicy tuna roll, and eel nigiri. They accidentally brought us the crunchy crab roll too and let us keep it no extra charge of course. Everything was amazing. We also got the spicy shrimp tempura ramen too (our eyes were bigger than our stomaches, and yes we got togo bags, were not sumo wrestlers!) I only wish they would set the shrimp tempure off to the side and not have it sitting in the ramen because it got soggy quick. I would probably just stick with sushi next time.  TIP: Don't pay $12 for parking. The parking meters are free during the weekdays, we parked in front of the courthouse a block away for free, lots of open spaces to park.  WE WILL BE BACK!!!",

The server was a little brief but I understood he was under a great deal of stress. The TV was showing some weird show about making fake food I think? I was confused. I grew up watching Japanese soaps with my father but this was something else. I found it entertaining but I'm not sure that everyone wants to watch that.   The food came out quickly and was fresh and delicious. For this quality sushi it wasn't a bad price either. I would come here again if I am ever in the area.   They were totally understanding of splitting the bill with two cards in unequal amounts, and I have no complaints.",

For starters, when we placed our order, the waitress looked at the sushi order card and asked us \"have you eaten here before? Our portions are large and I think you ordered to much\".  So we took off a couple of items. She was not kidding. Rolls are 10 pieces and a generous size too. The salmon sashimi for example was maybe 1/4 thick and 3x2 inches and 6-7 pieces in the serving for about $12. Incredible value! Even though we removed a couple of items, we still way over ordered but we couldn't stop eating! A must try is an item called \"Oh My God\" roll. It's better to experience it rather than me describe it and definitely worth ordering. Go with a good appetite!",

Extremely dedicated to the craft with purple rice and fresh, flavorful ingredients. We sampled six different rolls and three different sashimis. All were amazing. The miso soup is wonderful, the tempura is lightly battered and fresh, the service was terrific, and the sake bombs ... well... they lit the party. Can't wait to go back and try the green tea ice cream too. This little gem is going to be your favorite sushi place too. Hit them up!!",

The waitstaff and chefs were actually Japanese and I could speak Japanese with them but they were personable and funny with the rest of my group.   The sushi itself was delicious. It was fresher fish than I ever could have imagined getting in Phoenix.   Besides the standard classic sushi basics, which were all very well made, the chef also brought us some seared modern takes to try as well.   All in all, it was an amazing meal and the sushi was better than most places in good west coast. If you enjoy sushi I can't imagine you'd be disappointed.",

I heard about this place through Yelp and decided to try as many of the recommended special rolls we could fit in our bellies. In the end we had the oasis, Harumi, rainbow, H3 (spicy), and Oh My God rolls, and they were ALL fantastic and unique! My girlfriend said we should just live in this place and eat here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The chef (Juno, which I'm sure I'm not spelling correctly) sent over dessert of green tea ice cream, something I never would think to try on my own but now crave, along with strawberry ice cream in a mango slice flower arrangement, again amazingly delicious.  Being from San Diego we were hesitant to try sushi in a desert place like Phoenix, but we finally gave in to our craving and we're so glad we did! If there was any way to give more stars we would, like 6 out of 5, but for now we can only count the days to our next trip downtown.",

My bf brought me here after reading some yelp reviews but I was extremely skeptical.  After moving from LA about 3 years ago, I have not been able to find a good sushi spot in Phoenix.  Ive tried so many places guided by yelp, but was always disappointed.  Luckily, we stumbled upon this gem!  Everyone was so friendly and the service was amazing! I work in the restaurant industry, so I am definitely a critic when it comes to good service.  The owner, Juno, was so personable and genuine, he really made our night special  The staff was accommodating and knowledgeable about the food.  This was certainly the cherry on our evening.  They use purple sushi rice for their rolls and nigiri, which is much healthier than plain white sushi rice.  I was a little hesitant when I saw the purple rice, but it was delicious!!! My bf earned many brownie points for finding Harumi.  They also have a location in Scottsdale called Kodo Sushi that we will definitely be trying. Must try this place!! You will not regret it!",

It's small, but the staff readily took our reservation for 12. We arrived and were warmly welcomed by the entire staff. Our waitresses were very helpful and efficient during ordering especially since people were paying individually. The birthday boy and I shared 4 rolls- H3, Crazy, Spider, & the Super Crunch. I also had the seaweed salad- it was cold, tangy and so tasty! Others ordered the Las Vegas, shrimp tempura, pot stickers, and veggie tempura. Everyone loved the food. It was fresh, the purple rice was fun, the sushi chefs were extremely fast. The head chef even brought out some type of salmon roll for said birthday boy and we all sang. Afterward we found a little room for mango mochi and green tea ice cream. Delicious! The pricing is very reasonable and we would definitely return! If you don't like sushi this is not the place for you as the non-sushi items are limited to udon or appetizers. Definitely check this place out if you're in town!",

We ordered Oh My God sushi and it was just as the name says.  When we placed our order the waitress asked if we were hungry because we had ordered so much.  ( Oh My God was one of 6 plates we ordered) We were hungry but still had difficulty finishing everything and took our leftovers with us.  The owners, each came to our table to make sure we were enjoying our meal.  Couldn't express our happiness with the amazing food and genuine hospitality we received.  This will be a go to place every time we visit Arizona.",

    "text": "A group of 6 (4 adults, 2 children) of us came here for dinner before we went to go watch the Nutcracker at the Orpheum Theater. I had looked up sushi places in the area and this one came back with great reviews. After having eaten there, I completely understand why.   We got there as soon as they opened and was immediately greeted by the staff and sushi chefs, which is customary of sushi/Japanese restaurants. Having lived in Japan for 9 years, it's always great to be greeted by the staff in a similar manner. The staff was extremely friendly and answered all our questions. We were met with the same service being the only family there in the beginning and when the restaurant filled up. They make you feel comfortable and you get a sense of pride and that they're happy you came in. We ordered a handful of rolls; more than what could fit on the small tables. Unlike other restaurants that will just bring you everything and have you sort of figure out spacing, they brought out only a few rolls at a time and were patient in waiting until you've eaten what was brought before bringing the next dish. The main chef (who I believe is also one of the owners) came out frequently to check out to see that everyone in the restaurant was doing good and that the food was to their liking. The chefs were also very accommodating to the two children and even asked if could prepare any of the rolls differently for them. Service like that is very appreciated and something you don't see in a lot of other restaurants. The pricing for the rolls were decent and for the quality of the ingredients used, definitely worth it.  If you are going to try any roll, I would recommend the Oh My God Roll. It's quite the presentation, but the flavor combination is just delicious. Their sashimi is melt in your mouth good.  As you leave, all the staff greets you as you leave and the chefs all smile and say goodbye.",

I checked in on yelp and got a bowl of good miso soup ($1.50) and a big cup of edamane ($3). So by checking in on here you get almost $5 of free food. I decided on the 5 piece sushi and I think it is the crazy roll. As you probably can tell from pictures and other reviews, they use purple rice, which is healthier for you. The roll that came out was very good, the fillings complimented each other and it wasn't overbearing like some rolls can be. The sushi that came out was a piece of yellowtail, 2 salmon, and 2 tuna. All of them were fresh and tasty. I think this might be the best sushi place in Arizona... can't decide between this and Mido....But for $15, a roll and 5 pieces of sushi is a very good deal. I will very likely be back.",

I didn't want to drive out so I did find this place on Yelp that had terrific reviews. Fine, let's get some fish in the dessert.   I looked up the menu online and the prices were relatively cheap to California. Especially considering it's in downtown/financial district.   There were only a few parties dining on a Saturday evening. I was hoping it wasn't a bad sign. We were greeted right away and got seated. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.   We ordered a couple of rolls and chirashi. WOW! We were surprised on the quality and the detail the chef (Juno) put into his work. If you know sushi, you know that there are crappy sushi, from cheap Japanese restaurants/buffets, and good sushi/rolls that you get from a $$$$ spot. This was definitely a $$$$ spot at a $$ price. They used black rice, which comes out purple, that are more costly than white rice. Rice was cooked and prepared perfectly. The fish were fresh. They even had REAL WASABI in their chirashi! Everything was prepared flawlessly! I ended up getting another chirashi.   So to all you locals in Phoenix: You guys are very fortunate to have a restaurant with such a good chef. It's really unfortunate that even though California has so many Japanese places, 99% of them are crap.   (I have NO idea why there's a reviewer that gave you 2 stars even though she said the sushi was \"great.\" It's no fault of the chef that there was a big order before yours. Good sushi takes time to prepare.",

Two of us shared an Omakase (chef's choice meal) at $25.00 per person that was creative, deftly served, and more than abundant.  I actually asked the chef to stop sending over courses!

This sushi shop isn't one of those affected locations where you'll feel like you need to dress up.  The owners are on site often and overall, this is our favorite place to go for sushi.  I HIGHLY recommend the Oh My God roll.  It was named well.  It is my favorite roll anywhere.",

I don't know if the rice made the sushi taste better or not but all the tools we had were excellent, fresh tasting and great flavor. Only one thing, even tho it adds to the charm, small place, packed house, a lil slow on the service but not enough to take any stars away..well done.",

The place isn't big, but they use their space very well; there was no wait when we arrived. My friend and I sat next to the sushi counter and each ordered the udon / shrimp tempura roll lunch special. The rolls were so good they needed no soy sauce or other seasoning. We enjoyed watching a nearby table order the OMG Roll, which arrived flaming in tinfoil and was ceremoniously unwrapped by the server. The sushi chef gave us a complimentary order of seared salmon, a two-piece nibble which might be the tastiest thing I have eaten this week. I am definitely coming back here!",

Once you walk in you are definitely welcomed with such enthusiastic smiles and service. Sushi here is very active as when I say active sushi is always made so you definitely know your plate and rolls are going to be fresh indeed! You get a simple paper menu, and they also have to go sushi if you want to do grab and go which is something I can definitely get into. Our waitress and the workers were really interactive and so helpful! Guiding us Thru our menu and definitely the elder lady in the glasses helped us out with her cheerful personality. She pointed out he special which was better than the special roll we were gonna get which was the spicy combo roll or h3 maybe? But definitely get the \"omg\" roll cause it will let you be saying oh my gosh! Such a cool concept and delicious roll you'll just have to try it yourself! All their sushi roll is made with a healthy purple/black rice which is delicious and healthy for you I heard. Definitely don't mind, you pay for what you get and that's excellent sushi! Might be the best one in Phoenix so far! Well you'll certainly see my face there! If your in downtown ; it's a must stop by! Stay hungry Phoenix!",

They have purple sticky rice, which at first I thought was dyed with beets or cabbage, but I learned is actually a rice native to Thailand, which is pretty cool. I'm not usually crazy about miso soup, but this was really good and flavorful. The potstickers were basic but a nice touch. I got a spicy tempura roll, and a tempura shrimp roll (2nd option on the lunch menu) which I thought were both delicious. I really want to go back and order off the full menu, because I watched some really interesting presentation with some of the other rolls. We also shared a bottle of sake. They were out of the cheap sake I asked for, but the server recommended a much nicer and stronger bottle that she gave me for a great price. Service was great, food and drinks came out quickly, and we really enjoyed our food. We will definitely be back.",

The shrimp tempura roll is SOOOO good and the blending of flavors is literally like nothing you will experience anywhere else. They are sushi masters here. I would give their sushi (and I've had several rolls) 5 stars for quality, freshness, and taste. Absolutely the very best sushi I have ever had! The ahi tuna tower and HG roll are the bomb!!! The rolls are full of tons of fish and the black rice is super delicious and hard to find!  This is a must try!  Service: Quaint, local and great service! The chefs seem very friendly and happy to be there. The servers were very attentive as well as the chef. He gave everyone a complimentary seared tuna and fried yellow fish tempura. And the service was welcoming with timely checkups throughout dinner. We made a reservation, and were immediately seated upon arrival. No wait for anything from our drinks to getting our starters. The waitress is also awesome. She is so hyped up with energy somehow and pleasantly nice. Very good demeanor even when it's busy and she is scurrying around everywhere.  Atmosphere: This place feels very authentic and friendly to me, a comfortable environment for an excellent meal. Decoration is casual, yet classy, trendy and modern. And yet, one can tell it is at heart a mom and pop operation, with authentic Japanese cuisine. They have tables for two lined up against the sushi bar. No one faces the bar which is odd. And it was pretty busy over lunch hour with most taking food away. Usually the owner waves at you while he's making delicious rolls, and says bye and thanks you for leaving as you walk out.   The overall experience was fulfilling and I felt very satisfied! Very reasonable prices for such a fantastic dining experience! The staff is so friendly and welcoming. The owner was very nice and friendly. The sushi rolls are creative and delicious. One of the best sushis I have ever tried. The atmosphere is lively. This place is clean, unique, friendly and savory. I cannot wait to come back. It's a great place to go alone or with company. Please go and visit and support our wonderful downtown! I will most definitely be returning to satisfy future cravings! You can't go wrong with this place.",

Juno joked with us for a while being very welcoming and gave us free sake even after we said no cause didn't want to impose, then later he checked on us and give us some edamame and miso soup on the House. Really made this experience wonderful!   Sushi: is very good quality and excellent rice to fish ratio. Also very moist but not to the point were it falls apart, which can be an issue with some places if not dry.   Price: specialty rolls averaged 10 - 13 dollars which is better then average for the area and AZ in general. Even had a bluefin tuna roll special for $10   I have been eating sushi twice a week for years because my gf is Asian ;) and this place has some of the best quality you will find in AZ",

We came here last night, and were quickly seated on a decently busy Thursday evening.   I had flipped through the pictures and saw the platter for two people for $35 and figure with that and some miso soup and seaweed salad we would be full and happy.  To start, the seaweed salad was really bad, like reallllllly bad. I tried it and could barely finish my bite because it was frozen. So that sucked. The miso came out really fast, and was okay. Nothing super special but, then the platter came out. At first glance it seemed like there was a lot of different kinds of fish, but then the server explained it and we had like 4 types of tuna, and the same yellowtail for sashimi in the rolls. There was also salmon both cooked with eel sauce and sashimi. It was all of fine quality but there just didn't wow me.   I think the server was nice, I let her know about the seaweed salad and she took it off the bill. The fish was decent, but I just wasn't too impressed.",

We were seated right in front of the sushi bar and right in front of the owner Juno, who quickly became our new best friend. We ordered sake, the Omakase (Chef's Choice), blue fin plate and Cali roll. The chef's choice had salmon nigiri, spicy salmon wrapped in pretty thin slices of avocado, toro, squid, octopus salad, it was all wonderful and beautiful!! Juno handed us a yellowtail sample that was light and citrusy that was on the house because he said I was too pretty. I shall take all the compliments and yummy sushi I can get! The blue fin plate even had little flecks of gold. Our server was very helpful and had nice recommendations which we appreciated as this was our first time aft the restaurant.   Juno checked on us a few times and was kind, asking us what we were up to this weekend. He's playful with his staff and greets and thanks all the customers that walk in. He was at the right level of in your face customer service.   Great date night, we highly recommend this place. Looking forward to our next visit.",

Even with a ~$30 Uber surcharge to leave and return to the airport, Harumi was well worth it. They have [relatively exotic] sashimi options off-menu such as Toro and Uni. My only wish--and this would never take away from a star--is that their space was large enough to accommodate seats at their sushi bar. When I eat good sushi I like to interact with the chef :)",

I had veggie tempura, H3 roll and the OMG roll; all three were excellent.  The OMG roll comes wrapped in tin foil and is flamed by the server for a smoky flavor -- a first for me -- but both rolls were large, rich, complex and very hearty.    The only reason why this isn't a 5 star rating was the atmosphere, feeling a bit more like a lunch hour deli than Japanese restaurant.  The stereo pumping out loud 80s favorites like \"Karma Chameleon\", \"Ghost Busters\" and \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was a bit odd -- no, more surreal than just odd.  I sat at the front and perhaps the ambience was different at the sushi bar or at the back.    I'd come back for the food and service but perhaps not the musical playlist.",

While this is certainly sushi in a broadest sense - it's totally hipster sushi.  It's mainly rolls. Rolls of every conceivable name.  The rice is only the dark variety ( hipsters ).  That kind of rice changes the texture and consistency of the meal and adds a different finish to each bite... it also doesn't pick up the flavors as well having its own.    IMHOP rolls all start to taste the same because they are usually so sauce intensive. Small sushi and sashimi selection.  Again, very fresh, super friendly, and very busy!

I wonder why they gave up the counter spaces for only 4 table seats... Now the food.  It was not bad.  The black rice they are so famous for... I'm not a fan.  Black rice is more chewy and doesn't have the stickiness and softness of traditional white rice.  Once my nigiri rice ball got wet from soy sauce, it fell apart.  Other than that, the rainbow and dynamite rolls were decent.   Held up better, probably because of the seaweed.  Chicken gyoza were deep fried instead of pan fried.  Miso soup was... Miso soup.  Happy they had Sapporo.  Not too shabby for Arizona of all places. For the lunch special price, I'd say it was pretty decent for downtown area. Service was fine. Location is a bit tight.  They share the restrooms with other tenants in that buliding. Would I return? Maybe after I've tried other spots. Food 3.5* Price 4.5* Service 4* Location 4*",

    "text": "Should you try this place? Yes, Yes and Yes!! There is a reason for the excellent reviews. The rolls are very similar to most places but each have a unique spin on them. The purple rice is fun and the bill at the end doesn't make you flinch. I loved the salmon sashimi with the wasabi sauce on them. They had the perfect kick. The oasis roll was super refreshing. I was not a big fan of the ahi tower since it was just lots of rice and spicy tuna mostly and I find the rolls and sashimi much better. The edamame is a very small portion. So order two! The service is very fast. I blinked and here was our food... fantastic since I was starving. The rolls are enormous but so good you'll eat double. Come here hungry for sure!",

Why do you not just let me sit in a more comfortable booth??? The manager comes by and ask if I had a beer. I said yes, however I do not understand how that relates to where I want to sit??? He stated he wants me to leave so I comply.  This place is not recommended in my opinion since they have total disregard to their customer!!!",

I called and let them know so that they were aware of the issue but the lady from the restaurant told me that \"we get that a lot and people want something from us.\"  I was very offended because I wanted them to be aware of their food contamination and didn't want anything from them.  I'm really surprised that they have 4.5 stars rating on yelp. If they are getting many food poison complaints, then our incident is not an isolated case. This needs to be investigated.

No signs explaining whether or not to seat self. There was a dirty dish cart next to us by front door. Somewhat crowded for small space.  So apparently you should: 1. Know what you're ordering. Or 2. Walk up in line to register & get a menu to figure out what you want before your turn.  When we ordered the cashier checked to see if there were rolls prepared in to-go dishes in the display next to her. Odd. I came to eat \"fresh-prepared\" food inside!?  As u pay the register asks for a tip. To which I asked if they would be delivering our dishes to our table. No they do not. They call your number and u walk up. Why tip? I felt obligated & tipped 10%.  Self seated in the back. It was that or by hot windows. We were next to the ice machine and makeshift storage closet with curtain. Place was warm. (It is 116* outside so pass on that.) Two rolls we ordered were great! Did not come with cucumber salad or Miso soup. You pay separately for that.  Overpriced for the overall experience. Thank goodness I had good company or I would have had a horrible time.  Probably won't go back though. I'd much rather pick up to-go sushi from Sprouts & eat at my desk.",

The staff is extremely pleasant and helpful, but it was a bit overwhelming having 3 different servers for our table.  Then I went to use the rest room and it's through an exit door, down a long hallway, through a couple more doors then you reach a shared restroom by other businesses. So that was a little strange and scary.  Then the last thing that really turned me off was that I had noticed the sushi chef had gone out the exit looking door towards the bathroom while still wearing his food prep gloves. Now I don't know where he had gone maybe to make a phone call I don't know, but he returned still wearing the gloves and went right back to preparing food for people. That right there ruined it for me.",

Not super trendy or fancy, but a great spot for a casual date. Upon entering, you're greeted with a big KONICHIWA from the owner and staff who bend over backwards to make sure every guest feels welcomed and has a positive experience. The signature forbidden rice is a fun twist on old classic. The sushi is absolutely delicious and the portions are huge! We always end up with more than we need because it's just too good to stop order. The H3 roll and Sushi Combo appetizers are favorites of ours. Give this downtown Phoenix spot a chance, you won't be disappointed.",

The waitresses hover over your table waiting to snatch anything they think you might be done with, even if you aren't, it's like they're trying to rush you out the door. If they get your order wrong it's always your fault. Went in once with a friend, all single and double tables were taken, there were 3 booths open that sat 4 people, they would NOT give us one of those booths, they told us they were ONLY for parties of 4, so they made us stand there 10-15 minutes (no waiting area to sit in) until one of the other tables became available. I would have left but it was 110 degrees outside and I was on lunch hour, didn't feel like wandering to find another spot to eat last minute. I might have understood had there only been 1 booth left and they wanted to hold it in case a party of 4 came in, but there were 3 booths, and not  SINGLE one of those booths was taken at any point during our visit, we ate and left and all 3 booths remained open -__- such poor business sense and customer service, I understand if they like to seat 4 people at a 4 person booth, but when you have 3 open, seat your waiting customers!",

Portions are generous. I ordered 5 piece nigiri plate w/ roll and gf order spider crab roll. Highly recommend the nigiri plate for those who enjoy raw fish and dislike eating imitation crab/fried ingredients. The raw fish was served well thawed that it tasted creamy ( cuz we all sushi eater should know that raw fish must be frozen first to kill bacteria and thawed enough that you can taste the full texture and flavor of the fish w/o the fishy flavor). The servers were very attentive as well as the chef. He gave everyone a complimentary seared tuna and fried yellow fish tempura which was delicious. Experience was excellent and if I were to visit phoenix again I would definitely eat at this sushi restaurant.",

We decided to go down the street for a couple of drinks and come back later, I'm so glad we did!  We came back around 8:45 and got a table right away. The service was AMAZING and the food was even better. We had a couple of rolls and a sashimi sampler, so fresh and so tasty! Chef Juno came out to greet us and gave us complimentary green tea ice cream and it was delightful!  This is definitely  our new fave sushi spot!",

The sushi at first tastes healthy, maybe I was just sold on this purple rice phenomenon, but wow, it was fresh. Not just fresh meaning cool but the actual definition fresh. The OMG roll intros with all the bells and whistles with the flaming plate slightly cooking the eel. It tastes like some old school Filipino BBQ with a finish of fresh fish. The H3 roll was spicy, but refreshing flavor from the sauce.  The service was welcoming with timely check ups throughout dinner. My wife and I enjoyed the food!

    "text": "My first time having forbidden rice aka purple-looking rice. It definitely adds a unique touch to the sushi rolls. I still like my nigiri with white rice though. Fresh wasabi was added on top of the nigiri. If you want additional fresh wasabi, they will charge you an extra $2.00 for \"real wasabi\". I was so bummed out because the other sushi place that I usually frequent gives out fresh wasabi FREE all the time. My favorite item on the menu was the H3 roll. It was spicy, but not in any way a tear-jerker kind of spicy. I would also recommend getting the spicy sashimi salad, which was super good with strong flavors of sesame oil.   Service was quick. We made a reservation, and were immediately seated upon arrival. The waitress forgot to bring out the miso soup we ordered until our meal was half done. By then, we had to cancel the soup from our order.   This place is right in Downtown Phoenix. They do not have a private parking lot. There's a public parking lot behind the building that was $12.00 on a Monday! We settled for street parking at the meters right across from the Wells Fargo Museum instead - way cheaper. It's a four hour limit after 5pm versus a 1 hour limit before 5pm.",

    "text": "Once again my fellow; thank you! If it's been a while since you've been downtown make sure to allow yourself extra time to find a place to park and find to this place. All of the one way streets made parking a little tricky. I arrived around 4:30p and asked the hostess if they could prepare for a party of 10. I had four out of ten of us that arrived on time and they said we couldn't be seated until our entire party arrives. We were all thirsty and started to talk about going somewhere else and that's when we think the owner said we could sit down. I didn't think this was a good start. Now moving on to the appetizers, sushi and mochi. We ordered shrimp tempura and the stuffed jalapenos. The shrimp was very fresh and the tempura batter was seasoned well, very light and crispy. The stuffed jalapenos were slightly spicy but the crab filling balanced out the spice perfectly. We tried around five different rolls. The Caterpillar roll, OMG roll, Sex in the city roll, H3 roll, and Las Vegas roll. All of the rolls were seasoned well, tasted fresh and were a perfect size to pop in your mouth. Throughout our entire meal the servers were on point with making sure our table was cleared quickly of dirty plates and refilled our drinks as soon as they noticed we were running low. Oh and the black tea is very good as well. Of course I couldn't pass on dessert which I loved. I ordered the strawberry and mango mochi. It was the perfect end to a fantastic meal. The restroom is in a strange area; you'll see what I mean. Lastly, due to the delay to sit down is the only reason I won't give them 5 stars. Otherwise the drinks and food were absolutely delicious!!!",

Walked past Z-Pizza (now closed, sadly), Harumi and the Thai place next door. Thai looked a little stuffy, Z-Pizza is kaput, so we figure sushi it is...  Place is super busy, but we get a nice booth in the back. Good banter with the older Asian gal that sat us. Dig it. We see some of the rolls on other people's plates, and they look sensational.   They have Koshihikari Echigo and big bottles of Asahi at a reasonable price. Two of my favorites. Fuck yeah.   Order the Poke Stack, a few rolls, some nigiri and Jalapeno Rolls. All are outstanding, some of the best fish I've had outside of super-locals-only-spots in Hawaii where I couldn't go without my Japanese lady friend. Absolutely love their rice, color and texture is perfect. The Jalapeno Roll was something I've never seen, but was executed perfectly. How they get the pepper cooked perfectly with perfect tempura on the outside is beyond me. Hats off!  Great conversation with the couple seated across from us after they ordered some sort of amazing roll served in a flaming foil fan. Very cool, and good vibes in this restaurant.  Service was fast, friendly and efficient. Food comes out quick given how busy they were. All the chefs are sure to wave \"bye\" when you leave, too.  We will definitely be back. Totally worth the trip, this is now our only sushi spot in AZ.",

Plenty of parking around the area (mostly metered or paid parking).   Pretty decent sushi, cute place for a date night. Kinda small restaurant so expect to have to wait a little bit.   Their black rice sushi is pretty interesting and it taste no different than the regular ones. It's always nice to feel like you're eating healthier haha. The sashimi quality is slightly below what I normally have at LA, but given that it's in Phoenix I think it's pretty good already.   Very fast service, food came out 5 minutes after we ordered and we also got a complimentary side of seaweed salad (decently big portions for free seaweed salad). Overall good experience!",

    "text": "The first time we came to Harumi, I passed the tables and saw something with tin foil on it. When the waitress came to take our order, I pointed to the tin foil. She nodded and smiled widely, and I was excited to see what the big fuss was about. Our waitress came back, and the tin foil was on fire. Yeah, fire. Wait, one more time in case that didn't come across, fire. She moved the tin foil around, playing with the fire, and after a few seconds was able to open it. I popped one of the sushi pieces into my mouth (is it still sushi if it's cooked?), and went \"Oh my God.....\" Hence the name, O.M.G. sushi. Can I describe how the outer flavored meshed together with the inner spices? Crab, eel, and shrimp, all my favorite things in one roll.  That was my experience my first time at Harumi, and I have come back repeatedly since. Part of me hates reviewing this place because we come here so often and I don't want anyone else to come here because it's already a popular place, but Harumi deserves so much praise. It's one of our favorite date night spots because the service and food is amazing.  The staff is so friendly and sweet, and when we order sashimi we always receive huge chunks of fresh fish. The sushi is wrapped in purple rice, also known as Emperor's rice, because it used to be forbidden to all except royalty since the rice is super healthy, and that's just what they use for their regular rolls! If that were not enough, you can also order a Mini Roll Combo, where you can choose up to three different kinds of sushi to try! It's a great way to sample a few, and trust me they are all delicious, including the Phoenix, the Dragon, and the Las Vegas Roll.  So at the risk of blowing up an already blown up date spot, go to Harumi, I'll probably already be there stuffing my face with their delicious sushi.",

I am a bit of a sushi snob- we have been to about 10 sushi places around Phx area (Chandler, Scottsdsle, Gilbert, Phx) and typically each place disappoints,  BUT happy to say no longer!!! Harumi Sushi was a very very pleasant surprise! The fish was the freshest I have had! No fishy taste at all! Like butter melting in your mouth! We got the OMG roll- comes in aluminum foil and they light up bottom w fire so it sizzles- that had incredible taste and the rice got a bit crispy on roll- heaven! We also got spicy tuna roll/ every place I've been to just squirts extra Siracusa sauce into mixture to make it spice up BUT Harumi does something very different. Very very good, different kind of spice and full flavor. Excellent roll. Finding Nemo roll we ordered without spice cuz of our 3 yr old. He loves the roll, was not my husband and my fave, but not bad in the least.  The seaweed salad was a large portion and very delicious. The nigiri was top of the line: tuna and salmon- like butter! Service was excellent but they did try to rush you; however, they may see it as being efficient. I loved the wait staff- most spoke Korean, so do we, so we felt at home here. You MUST try this place.... or maybe don't! I'd like to keep this place all to myself!!! No need to dress up- come as you are. Metered parking or paid parking right next to building- all take credit card.",

And finally after waiting for 20 minutes for the rest of the food, our server came back to ask if we needed anything else or if we wanted the check... (What check? We only had one plate arrive. We've been waiting on the rest of the food.... my girlfriend does not eat raw fish and the only plate that arrived was nigiri that I ordered.   What I found particularly annoying after the wait was that the server never apologized, never said sorry once. Instead, she proceeded to explain that in this type of situation, this is never the servers fault it's the kitchen's. I don't care whose fault it is, she should have apologized on their behalf, even if it's not her fault.   I'm not the type of person to ask for it, but nothing was taken off the bill.",

Cali, NYC, Boston...and this place is easily near the tippy top of the list of best sushi I've ever had...the H3 roll was fantastic, love the spicy kick at the end. The Ahi Tower (kind of a deconstructed roll) is hands down one of my favorite dishes ever at a restaurant!!  We also had the spicy tuna roll, which is one of our favorites to begin with, but it was even better with black rice. My wife and I then proceeded to eat every single piece of food that came with the Omakase for two dish, and everything was not only extremely tasty but just SO SO fresh!! The generous chef then topped it all off with a complimentary \"sushi dessert,\" which was 6 pieces of what looked like little mini tuna steaks just perfectly adorned with some wasabi flavoring...can't say enough good things about this place. I actually did not think there were any sushi places in AZ worth going to, but we made the 45 min drive from the West Valley just to try this place and it was well worth it. Do not miss out on this Phoenix gem, if you're a sushi fan, this place is a MUST try...thank you Harumi, we will be back!!!!",

Don't get me wrong I enjoyed my experiences at the other places, but Harumi has made my day! Do yourself a big favor and try it for yourself at least once. I had ordered over the phone, two OMG ( Oh My God)  rolls to go for lunch for myself and a coworker. I was told 15 minutes, I was there in 10 and they were ready for me when I arrived. Now do keep in mind this is my very first visit to Harumi , and I was blown away at the freshness of the shrimp, crab, and eel, the purple rice definitely added to the taste profile of this roll. It was amazing and delicious, I nearly devoured and inhaled it...LOL! So for my experience at Harumi today I give them a 5 star rating. Keep up the great job HARUMI and Employees!",

The Sex and the City roll is great comfort food, and fresher, crisper rolls are nice too. Sex and the City is my go-to. After finally trying more variety recently, I wasn't as impressed by how I branched out. The rainbow roll wasn't very flavorable, and the Las Vegas roll had too much going on without being super great.",

But once it was on my plate and after reading about the health benefits of it, I was really into it.  The fish is FRESH (as fresh as it can be seeing we are in Phoenix, AZ) and the food is delicious.  The atmosphere is always a nice vibe and you are usually greeted with a smile.   You should visit this plae if you are a fan of sushi. YUMMY!",

I ordered the salmon sushi and a mini combo roll (rainbow, Las Vegas, and I believe the Oasis). The fish quality wasn't that bad, but the rice was a bit sweet (and purple). I don't really like sweet things in general and the rice took away some of the flavor of the fish, which was disappointing to me. The construction of the rolls was clever and tasty so good job to the designers. Realistically, if you want some good sushi in the area then stop by this place, but I don't think I'll be back on account of the sweet rice. Lastly, the prices here are very reasonable.",

Star 2: the service was great. We were seating pretty quickly and given adequate time to order and enough time to talk before getting our food.  Star 3: the atmosphere was nice; not my favorite atmosphere but still nice; it was cool how the cooks made the sushi out in the dining area.  Star 4: this is the I'm impressed star; I'm not much of a sushi guy because I don't like super potent fishy flavors, especially the flavor of seaweed, however, these flavors were almost nonexistent even when I had a huge chunk of seaweed in my mouth by itself. Everything tastes fresh.  I could not give this a 5th star because I was torn on whether or not it was worth the price. The crunchy crab roll was 7 dollars and that was a great price but the Arizona roll which had crab on it too and a few other ingredients was 12 dollars. I didn't think it should have been that much.  Overall a solid 4 star and a great sushi experience for not the biggest fan of sushi.",

It is right in the heart of downtown which makes it a really good place to go of you are looking to go out after hours or spend the day exploring. Also, it is a good place to go for showing friends around because they use purple rice for the sushi which is really cool looking and tasty.   The rolls my friend and I ordered were REALLY big and full of flavor. Our favorite was the \"oh my god,\" which came with a little fire show! I was so pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. I would suggest trying to sit near the sushi chefs, they are hilarious. They made our experience really funny and entertaining.   I only have great things to say about this place. The food, atmosphere, and employees make this place one of my favorite restaurants in AZ.",

    "text": "I was initially pretty skeptical of this place. From the street, it didn't look like much. Fairly standard decor on the inside, wobbly table..  However, I am definitely really glad I came in. The warmth and energy of the staff really fill the place, and you just get the feeling when you're inside that everyone is happy and glad to see you. It's just a nice, inviting place to be.  The food itself was really pretty good. Right now they're giving out a lot of extra sides to try and advertise, which I think is great. So, I had miso soup, edamame, ramen with tempura, picked daikon and some california rolls. The ramen itself tasted like it was made with nongshim shin ramyun black label. That is not a slight mind you. I cook that regularly. It had enough extra things in it, big strips of mushrooms, vegetables, that it didn't feel like a rip at all, even though I knew pretty much where it came from. The tempura was top notch. Likewise, the california rolls were significantly better than what one normally expects, and I enjoyed eating them, for a change. Overall, would definitely go back. I'd love to sample more of their menu.  Update: Went back as promised, this time had the sashimi combo. The sashimi itself was great. The combo also comes with an oasis roll, which has cucumber strips on the outside instead of rice. It wasn't bad by any stretch, but I think I prefer the rice. I also tried out the plum ice cream, which wasn't on the menu yet, for dessert. I didn't expect a lot from it, but it turned out to be amazing. Would definitely recommend that!",

    "text": "They use black/forbidden rice which was pretty awesome. They had a special on toro which is unheard of but the way they cut it made it significantly less enjoyable.  However, they've fallen into the same \"put something spicy in every goddamn roll\" runt every sushi place in Arizona seems to have fallen into. Seriously, there were maybe 3 options without anything spicy in or on them? Even after we made it clear to our server that we didn't want anything with spice, our rolls came out COVERED in wasabi and the chef seemed annoyed we sent it back and literally just push the Wasabi off with a fork and handed it back. We couldn't eat more than one bite each but didn't want to have try and deal with their attitude for sending it back again. If you can't make a good roll without making it spicy, you're not a good sushi place. It's not like this in California.  No non-sushi options if you bring a friend that doesn't like sushi.",

The OMG roll is a bit of a show, I found the smoked flavour a little sickening, but nothing terrible.  Service was first class and the owner is a real character.",

    "text": "Came to visit Phoenix for the long weekend, and wanted to grab some decent Asian food in the area. Not too many places popped up, but Harumi Sushi showed up as one with beautiful pictures of sushi and interesting purple rice. Of course, I jump on it and introduce the option to my family. We arrived around 12:30 pm for lunch on a Monday (though President's Day). The place was busy, but we were next on the list. It didn't take that long to wait.   We ordered a wide selection of items, and we had the chance to try them all.   Spicy Sashimi Salad ($10): comes with tuna, salmon, crab, masago, lettuce, cucumber, avocado with Sriracha sauce, eel sauce, and tempura flakes. To my surprise, the salad was mostly comprised of sashimi. You get thick cuts that are marinated in sauce, which almost reminded me of poke. Slices of fish were thick and almost melt-in-your-mouth. I enjoyed the tempura flakes, as they gave the salad a crunch. You get a slight kick of spiciness too! Definitely recommend this!   Tuna Sashimi ($12): comes with 8 pieces of nice and thick cuts of tuna. If you're a sashimi fan, this is a great option! However, I think that with the options you have, go for something that's more filling. The slices of fish that come with the other stuff are not lacking in comparison to the sashimi, so I think you get more bang for your buck with the other items.  H3 Roll ($13): comes with spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy yellowtail, avocado on top, cucumber, tobiko, masago, eel sauce, and spicy mayo. While this was one of the recommended on Yelp, I felt that this was slightly overpriced as compared to the other options you get on the menu. Flavors make it a solid roll, but there was not anything extremely special. It's not something I'd come back craving for though.  Mini Roll Combo ($15): this is a GREAT deal. I definitely recommend getting this. You basically get to try three different rolls, which is awesome. Choose from Rainbow, Dynamite, Las Vegas, Spider, Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Tuna, Crazy, Arizona, and Super Crunch Shrimp. I chose Dynamite, Las Vegas, and Arizona.  - Dynamite: California roll with spicy tuna & jalapeno on top. Decent roll, but nothing too out of the ordinary. Great if you're a spicy tuna fan and like that on top. - Las Vegas: fresh salmon, cream cheese, crab salad, jalapeno, avocado, eel sauce, and spicy mayo. This roll was absolutely amazing. GET IT. I loved how the roll was fried, which gave the roll an extra crunch that also powered up the inside of the roll with flavor.  - Arizona: tempura, shrimp, crab salad, cream cheese, avocado, topped with spicy crab, eel sauce, and tempura flakes. Liked this roll, but in terms of standing out, it was okay. The spicy crab on top was interesting and unlike most rolls I've had, though it worked out well.  5 Nigiri + Crazy Roll ($16): basically, these get you lots of fish, and not so much rice. What I loved about it was exactly that. Thick cuts of fish, and extremely fresh and soft. Crazy Roll almost reminds me of a protein roll, but you do get some rice. Definitely the majority is fish though. Would recommend!  Had the chance to also try the spicy tuna roll, which was a solid one if you like spicy tuna. Comes at $6. I also took pictures of gyoza and the 6 Sashimi + Oasis Roll, but I didn't try them because they weren't what we ordered (it was someone else's that they accidentally brought to us).   Would definitely bring someone here if I'm in the area. Parking may be a bit hard--you have to find street parking--but we had no problem finding a spot just a block down. Service may be a bit frantic, especially during peak hours, which was when they kept messing up orders. But once the storm died down, service was fine.",

    "text": "I've been to Harumi Sushi about 3 times between 6-8 months and every visit has made my belly smile. Their food is always consistent with great flavor and that explains Harumi's high rating.  First and foremost, let's not debate prices. You're going to eat high quality sushi and your wallet is going to get thin at the end of your meal. The price is pretty average for a downtown high quality sushi restaurant.   The service is very good! They did forget an item on my list though, once, but that's forgivable. Also, with high such popularity and high demand in a tiny restaurant, the wait times are long.  I'm more of a traditional sushi eater, so I typically order seaweed salad, gyoza, tempura,  sashimi, maki, and nigiri. What's not traditional about this place is the forbidden rice that they use. I thought it was very interesting!  The seaweed salad is just right. It tastes what it should be like. They also add some daikon shreds at the bottom too which is unusual in my experience, but it's not bad. The gyoza was a bit dry and overcooked (i have yet to find the perfect gyoza). Tempura was crispy and the veggies tasted fine.   I've always had salmon and yellow tail sashimi and they always taste the same: awesome. The fish is silky full of omega 3's. The texture is buttery smooth (especially the salmon) and the yellowtail is always sweet and flavorful. I enjoy eating them with the shredded daikon bed underneath each piece.   As for rolls and nigiris, the avocado roll came with cucumber (which I did not expect) and it was a pleasant surprise. I thought I wouldn't like it but I actually enjoyed it since it's not my usual plain avocado maki. The spicy salmon roll was wasn't bad at all (it's missing the \"oomf\" factor) but I did find the pieces to be a bit small. Maybe the small rolls and thinner ingredients contributed to the lack of flavor. The eel nigiri bursts inside your mouth. Each bite has the perfect amount of glaze/sauce, flavor, and texture (very soft!). Salmon nigiri's are amazing.   I will definitely go back to try out new foods and expand my comfort zone. Next thing on the list will definitely be a specialty roll.",

Finding local, high quality sushi at a reasonable price?  Yeah, good luck.  When people ask me for a recommendation for a good local sushi restaurant, the first place I always recommend is Hana.  A small comfortable neighborhood sushi spot with good product that won't totally crush your bank account.  Chain sushi places can deliver good sushi too, though often at a premium and in a fancy environment requiring requisite attire.  Well ladies and gentlemen, I didn't think I could recommend anything better than Hana.  Until today.  As I write this, Harumi Sushi is currently ranked as one of the top 10 highest rated restaurants in the Phoenix metro area on Yelp.  Seriously, check if you don't believe me.  There's five star reviews aplenty for this place even though they have almost no social media presence and no website.  I live just a half mile from Harumi so this place has been popping up on my radar for awhile.  Today I finally took the plunge.  The restaurant is fairly plain on the inside with a little bit of artwork around food prep area, but otherwise just simple tables and chairs.  Seats about 30-40 folks from what I could tell.  The owner (and head chef) Juno and the waitress on duty both greeted me and seated me immediately upon entering.  To start, I used the Yelp Check-in freebie for free miso soup and edamame.  Yes, they honor it and both dishes were excellent.  For the main course I was going to go with their staple, the Harumi roll.  The waitress gave me a look like \"that's all you're gonna eat?\" so I quickly sprung into action and got their Oh My God roll too.  Crisis averted.  First, the Harumi roll.  Shrimp, crab, purple rice, and avocado wrapped in tuna and topped with a spicy mayo blend.  Fantastic dish.  Rich flavors but not as heavy as I thought.  Next the Oh My God roll.  The first OMG about this roll is the presentation.  They bring out the roll wrapped in tin foil while the tin foil is on fire (I'm dead serious).  Don't worry, the waitress unwraps the foil for you, revealing a rainbow of colors.  Ingredients on this one include crab, shrimp, avocado, purple rice, eel, and tobiko (almost like a caviar) topped with eel sauce and that spicy mayo.  Oh My God yes.  Not overly spicy (though it does have some kick) and the two sauces smooth out the flavors perfectly.  The rolls were both huge (10 pieces each).  Somehow I had room (or motivation) for dessert so I decided to try some of their mango mochi ice cream.  Essentially a light mango rice cake with mango ice cream in the middle.  It came as four little bite sizes on the plate.  Clean, creamy, delicious and capped of the meal in spectacular fashion.  All together the free miso soup, free edamame, fountain drink, OMG roll, Harumi roll, mochi ice cream, and tax totaled $35.  I tipped the waitress $10 as she was super attentive and friendly the whole time (even though she scared me into ordering a second roll).  I enthusiastically thanked her and Juno for a wonderful meal.  Between the food, the service, and (most astonishingly) the price, Harumi sets itself apart from a saturated sushi industry in Phoenix.  I don't live next to major body of water, but Juno could've fooled me.",

    "text": "We went to Harumi sushi yesterday (just 4 min walk from Hyatt hotel) looking for dinner.  When we arrived we were warmly greeted and were immediately assigned a table.   Looking at the menu I noticed the wide selection of sashimi, nigiri and rolls.  I decided to try the OMG roll and the rainbow roll. The food arrived almost straight away and the OMG roll was brought by chef Juno. It was in tinfoil and on fire. The tinfoil was then removed to put out the fire.   The OMG roll tasted delicious combining the sweetness of the eel, sharpness if the fish, and softness of the avocado. The rainbow roll also tasted delicious.   We were also given free miso and edamame after logging in via Yelp!   Following that, we ordered the tempura shrimp roll that was nice and crispy on the inside.   We were then seen on our way out by Juno the chef and owner who was very kind!  I went back the next day for lunch and was again immensely satisfied.   I went for the Crazy roll with 6 pieces of nigiri. All amazingly fresh and the crazy roll was gorgeously soft. Juno then have us a free dish of seared tuna tataki. I then ordered the finding nemo roll which had a lovely crunch to it.   I was in Japan this April and this may be compared to the sushi I had in Japan! Brilliant food, lovely staff and a great location. I wish I was spending more than 2 days in Arizona.  Stunning!",

I came here few times last year and noticed that it was not good as before. Today, I gave one more shot.   First of all, visually it does not look good. My nigiri is slides weirdly and cut at the edge.  Second, my rolls seems rolled by a kid. It's not firm.  Lastly, I don't taste the fish. No flavor and don't know what happened.   I am also shocked how this place still has good review but location wise and many non local people visit so it make sense.",

I prefer to go here only for lunch as I like their other restaurant, Kodo, better for dinner.   For lunch, their chirashi bowl cannot be beat. Huge cuts of super fresh fish on top of purple rice for an extremely reasonable price. If you wanted this amount and quality of fish in nigiri/sushi form, it would easily be $50. They also don't douse it wish sauce. As much as I love their H3 roll, their is just way too much sauce on that thing.",

We also got some cold sake and beer because that's just how we eat sushi lol. The servers were funny and attentive.  The only thing I would note could have been better was that it was kind of muggy in the restaurant itself. It seemed like maybe their cooler didn't work or something as the fans were all on. I didn't really ask and just decided to drank more cold sake :)  I'd say the restaurant had more of a casual vibe as some sushi places can come off very \"fancy date night\" this one was more in the casual spectrum for a sushi place anyway.",

Since they don't take reservations, and there is limited seating inside it can get pretty busy on weekend evenings, but on my most recent Saturday visit we were seated very quickly. We got the Oh My God roll, which is my favorite! If you have never eaten it, YOU HAVE TO ORDER IT. Just try it once, if you don't like it I'm sorry I lead you astray, but if you love it, you're welcome. They cook the roll at the table, and it can be a big spectacle but this time our waiter kept it nice and low key. Their seaweed salad is also good. We also got the H3 roll which was very good, the crunchy mango roll was good and their version of a rainbow roll was better than traditional rainbow rolls but I'm usually not a huge rainbow roll fan. I've eaten here in countless occasions and the service is always amazing.",

While my friend and I sat down to eat, there was a screen across from me that described the benefits of the black rice. Apparently black rice has more antioxidants than blueberries and they're cancer-fighting as well. It also has high sources of vitamin E and iron.   I ordered a Philly Roll and Crazy Roll. The sushi was amazing with just the right proportions of fillings to rice. I hate it when I get sushi that has too much rice and not enough fillings, but Harumi Sushi got it right.  The main thing to emphasize about this restaurant is the black rice, again. This is the first sushi restaurant I have been to that makes their sushi with black rice. It feels good to know that people are health-conscious and it's another one of those healthy places where you don't have to feel bad about \"eating out\".",

I have gone to Harumi 10 plus times and it's absolutely amazing every time not one bad visit. It is worth the wait but I have never waited more than 5-10 min even with a line out the door. Highly recommend Harumi over any other sushi place in the valley. I have gone to all most all of the highly recommended sushi restaurants, even ones that are double to triple the price of Harumi in town, in the state, and out of state, and out of the country, they do not have anything on Harumi.",

    "text": "Being in downtown Phoenix for the very first time, I opened my Yelp app as usual, to look for a place to eat at. As I felt like some Asian food, this sushi restaurant Harumi Sushi caught my eye with very high average rating out of more than 1000 reviews. Besides, it was within a short walking distance from where I am staying. The restaurant name \"Harumi\" sounded so authentic Japanese but the truth was on the contrary. The menu was just the black and white regular small piece of paper you often see at a Japanese restaurant to order sushi.  I was leaning towards \"Chirashi\", but decided to go for \"Omakase\". It was 12 pieces of mostly Korean style nigiri, combination wise and rice wise and 4-5 small but thick slices of medium fatty tuna. Honestly speaking, I thought the price $35 was  a little too much to ask for for the food. The person who brought the dish to me did explain what the 12 nigiris (6 kinds) were, and the first two nigiris were explained to me as sea urchin. But it was actually salmon with creamy mayo sauce. Anyhow, as a True Japanese sushi lover, Harumi tasted so foreign to me.",

We always get the nigiri and a few rolls and the nigiri the first time we ever went was Ahmazinggg... The 2nd and third time were good, not amazing. I'm not sure why. The rolls are delicious if you know what you like. My favorite are crunchy, fatty, little spot of sweet and I'll add the spice.  That means i stick to rolls with those characteristics and I've yet to be disappointed.  Service: Great. We have anyways been attended very well and it's been from several different servers. The guys behind the counter are nice and wave and have even sent over complimentary tastings.  Ambiance: Varies. First time was super quiet and empty, next time was medium busy, third time was loud and full of very chatty clientele.  They have a selection of Japanese beers and sake and my hubs and i have always order the same ones every time because they're just good: Koshihikari echigo is what i get and hubs had the red Kawaba.",

From the first bite to the last bite, I was in sushi heaven! Cannot wait to go back for more!!  We arrived earlier in the evening on a Friday and snagged a parking spot across the street. It was actually pretty busy considering how early it was, but we were greeted immediately & seated towards the back. I would ask for a table closer to the front next time (the restaurant is very small but there seemed to be a lot of staff traffic in the back). Considering how good the sushi was, I'm sure it gets super busy, so I recommend going during off-hours.  Anyways, the sushi itself was amazing! I ordered the Las Vegas Roll and my fiance got the Mini Roll Combo with three different rolls. I can't remember all the ones we picked for the combo but I do remember the Super Crunch Shrimp! It wasn't a traditional sushi roll, but I liked it because I'm a fan of shrimp! My favorite thing we got was the Las Vegas Roll but I was glad that we got to try four different items in one visit. Each option we had was unique and everything seemed really fresh.  The service was also good; all the waitresses were helping all tables, so if we needed anything, we just grabbed someone who was walking by. We will definitely be back & would recommend this restaurants to others.",

The bathroom reminds me of some horror flick bathroom with a frosted glass door that leads to who knows where. But. You didn't come for the bathroom experiance...the sushi is amazing, when in this area I find it hard to not stop by. Can't go wrong with the \"oh my god\" it is delicious.

The server was helpful with beer selections. The card reader was down so that created some issues, and they really rushed us out of there at closing time... I've never had that happen before. I understand they want to leave at their suggested closing time but it was a little pushy in my opinion. In my defense, I was not aware that it was so close to closing time and I would not have chosen that venue had I known. However, it was only 9pm on a Saturday night.",

The chef and staff aim to please with their product and service, which seems hard to come by these days. Hopefully that will hold up as this place gets more popular and inevitably busier. The quality of the fish is top notch. I usually only eat nigiri, sashimi and sometimes maki. I try to avoid the other constructed rolls. The bigger rolls that I have tried are too saucy and/or fried for my taste. It would be nice if they had those \"Americanized\" rolls with other fresh ingredients and were not all fried or covered in some kind of sauce.  A couple of drawbacks... selections are slim from the fish to the adult beverages. There are a few bulk beers (InBev) or sakes (probably InBev too) from which to choose. There aren't any other kind of adult beverages.  The other drawback is that there is no option for white rice. The purple rice (black rice) is novel and lends a sweeter and nuttier flavor to the nigiri, but it can take away from the fish a bit. I would like the option to choose.  Picky are we? Yep.  Arigato gozaimas.",

This place, OMG not only the taste of their sushi and fresh salmon, tuna, yellow tail and many more are great but also the sushi chef and their server are so friendly. I have a great experience there. I don't understand why there are people who give them a couple star, sometime as a customer, we have to understand that there are time that we have to wait forever if they are so busy every restaurant we go. We are not the only one who wait for it, there are people ahead of us. So I really recommend this place. Unfortunately, if you don't have a good experience, then try it again. You will have a good time. LOVE This place........",

The sushi is always great. They have a series of pretty inexpensive rolls (two spicy rolls and the typical california and cucumber rolls, etc.) and then a bunch of specialty rolls. I'd love them to expand their menu further, so that we have more things to try.   This place feels very authentic and friendly to me. The building is casual (which may be a downside for some, but I prefer it). Nothing fancy, just an excellent meal in a comfortable environment.   Nothing better than some sushi, a friendly neighborhood place, and a large Sapporo on a weeknight!   I also really like it when the chef says good night when you leave!",

My waitress was new but didn't know whether the eel was heated, didn't know whether they had amaebi (which they didn't), and wasn't sure they made a hand roll. And hand rolls weren't even offered as an option in the menu. Hello.   And finally, the spider roll was OK, but should have come out warm.   And now finally, roll options were limited. Cream cheese should be offered on the Philly roll. They have cream cheese and spicy mayo as an add to all but 2 rolls. That hides bad fish. Come on now.",

I decided I didn't mind getting so to-go sushi they had already prepared, and they gave me, initally, a discount of 30%. Then, they decided to just give it to me for free. I loved the sushi and was overjoyed the whole night. I wouldn't have mind paying for it.  The other day was my first time being served, and I loved it so much. The server was nice and friendly. I ordered the OMG roll and Phily Roll and I'm still thinking about it. It was the best sushi I have everrrr eaten in my whole life. There is a reason why the OMG roll is called that. You will literally say OMG repeatedly. My boyfriend ordered the Las Vegas roll, jalapeno poppers, and ramen. His food was so good I ended up eating all of his food :P   I really enjoyed this place and I will come back soon.",

    "text": "Sushi?  In the middle of the desert???  I took my skeptical visiting Bay Area friends to this joint and they became believers.  It's not a mirage.  It's rare but possible.  Harumi Sushi, yummy.  I've been there three times in the last week.  Chef Juno is amazing and adorable.  Talk to him about what's fresh and order it.  Just say Omakase.  What a treat... blue fin tuna and o-toro (fatty tuna) were specials that night. Try their Oasis Roll + 6 piece sashimi combo.  It is an incredible smoking deal at $16.  The roll itself has cucumber wrapping, no rice, filled with fresh fish, sometimes called the Lollipop Roll at other places .  The 6 pieces of sashimi will vary, but we got delicious salmon belly, hamachi, and lightly seared albacore, which were all delicious.  At some other trendy places, just the cucumber-wrapped roll  or just the sashimi would be $16,  so this is a screaming deal for both together at $16...  and the Omakase was just $35 which was a great deal since it included high end fish like the o-toro.  Other memorable food items, the Oh My God roll, if you want to mix up the palette from all of the raw fish with some creamy goodness in the form of a table-fired tempura shrimp/unagi roll, the spicy sashimi salad, and the real wasabi.  It's $2 for a small portion but not every place has it so I'm always impressed when they do.  If you've never tried it, you should.  It's like chunky bits of wasabi meets capers.  You don't add it to your soy sauce like the normal powdery wasabi, just add a few chunks on top of each bite.  This place is definitely for foodies.  It's not about the scene here.  In fact... I'm debating whether I should be sharing this secret with you.   I don't want it to get too crowded or the prices to go up, but fine... I'll share.  :-)",

I also must say I've never had better service- my drink was always full and the chef gave us four small plate specials without charge!   We started with a miso soup and veggie tempura.  The tempura was very crispy and has great flavor, and the vegetables were very fresh.  Spicy tuna ha droll came out right when it was done, so the seaweed was crisp and never had time to get soggy.  We ordered three rolls- H3, OMG, and a tempura salmon one I can't remember the name...The rolls were all very fresh and good sized.  This is the only reason for 4/5 and not 5, the rolls we ordered were a little too similar to each other.  This could be an error in ordering but they were all delicious.    In addition, the chef gave us two salmon nigiri, tempura yellowtail, and mango mochi! Great service, the nigiri was insanely good.  Definitely coming back!",

The staff was nice, but not overly friendly. They also forgot part of our order (edamame and miso soup) which we just ended up canceling because all our rolls had already come out. I was impressed with how quickly stuff come out after we ordered.  They use black rice which was an interesting experience. My friend thought it tasted a little sweeter but I didn't really notice a difference. I got their taster roll so I could try a few pieces of 3 different rolls - why don't all sushi place do this?!?!? So brilliant.   The space could use a little rearranging and they should find a better place for their storage. We were given the table in the very back, squeezed in between all their boxes of booze (which was also a narrow path to the bathroom). That was a little annoying.   Overall it was a good experience and I would come back.",

They really understand that as diners we are trying to enjoy the food without too much interruption. The menu is not too expansive but the few things they have are done quite well. I like to start off with yellowtail sashimi. With 8 pieces costing $12 it's a pretty good deal. Additionally the fish was a nice temperature and tasted fresh and tender. Each roll that I've tried has also been a delight. First off the Oh My God roll has a smokey eel flavor that is not overwhelming but compliments the rest of the ingredients well. The H3 has a spicy kick that most japanese restaurants don't have, it might be a korean thing. The caterpillar roll is melt in your mouth from the fresh avocado to the eel. I've had the chance to try the mango crunch roll which has a sweetness to it mostly from eel sauce, the mango I found was a bit tart and made the roll a delightfully light flavor. The oasis is covered with cucumber instead of their signature purple rice, it's cooling and refreshing for summer, but I'm not a huge fan of that much tuna. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone that has a standard for raw fish.",

Some friends and I were in town for a conference downtown and this was just a short walk from our hotel. The wait on a busy Friday night was only 15 minutes or so, and service was impeccable. The owner stops by to say hi to every table and even sang happy birthday to one guest.   Now for the food - we were starving and all of our food came out remarkably fast once we had ordered. The combos are incredible deals! For $15, you can choose 3 mini-rolls (about 5 pieces each) out of several select signature rolls - if you're like me and want to try a bit of everything, this is perfect. I got the crazy, rainbow, and spider rolls, and all of them were amazing. The fish (especially salmon) was extremely fresh and together it was very flavorful and filling. They also had roll + 5 nigri or 6 sashimi combos for $15-$16, which 2 of my friends got and also really enjoyed.   Would definitely come back and try some of their other delicious-looking rolls!",

After reading a few good reviews, we left the game early and headed to Harumi Sushi before they closed at 9.  Parking isn't the easiest to find, but that's downtown for you. We parked around the corner and started walking towards Harumi Sushi. I almost walked right past it, as it is a hidden little gem.   We walked in, were greeted and sat right away. I picked edamame and stuffed jalapenos. The boyfriend picked salmon nigiri and the H3 roll. Shortly after we placed our order, they brought us blue fin nigiri courtesy of Chef Paul. Service moves pretty quickly as our food came out shortly after. Don't be alarmed, but the rice is purple! Purple rice is delicious. All the food exceeded my expectations and I will be coming back real soon.",

The one standout was the 'Oh My God' roll.  It comes wrapped in tinfoil and they set it on fire at your table.  It is an odd bbq fusion that really works.  The best roll I have had in a long time.  It's not Vancoucer but it is pretty dam good.   I'm not convinced that the purple rice actually has any material health benifits but it is a unique twist I hadn't seen before.  Not really a material difference in taste.",

From entering on a Friday night it was busy inside. Not a huge place which I prefer it being the size it is. We were greeted immediately and sat right away. No wait for anything from our drinks to getting our starters.   Of course I have to get the typical edameme and also ordered the crab salad. Edameme was warm, and the crab salad was in roll form! Delicious! Real crab not the fake krab btw...Anyways my dinner date ordered a platter of sashimi including albacore tuna,salmon and yellowtail. I ordered a combo plate with 3 different rolls for only $15.00!! They all were fresh and tasty! They do use purple rice, do not be afraid it is perfectly fine! They also do not skimp on the portions of filling and the rice is not overwheming like most places.  I don't appreciate when I get a roll and most of it is rice and small amount of filling.  The overall experience was fulfilling and I felt very satisfied! Please go and visit and support our wonderful downtown! I will most definitely be returning to satisfy future cravings!",

I love the purple rice, the atmosphere, and the hysterical waiters and waitresses. Seriously, service here is amazing. I had such a fun time. Everyone is so friendly and funny. They chat it up and tell you how to cheers in Japanese. It was fantastic! The sushi chef even gave me a free sample of their seared salmon nigiri (forgot to take a picture).

I got excited that they had this.  Usually, bulgogi is a korean dish, but I was hungry and decided to order it as well.  Word of advice:  Don't.  It was really really chewy and rubbery for me.

We ordered yellow tail nigiri, gyoza, a shrimp tempura roll, salmon & tuna roll in rice paper, and a california roll with fresh tuna on top (I don't remember the actual names of the rolls).   The meal started out with a complimentary cucumber salad, which was very good. Then we were brought out our order of gyoza which was a very generous portion with 8 dumplings (usually you get 6). After that we received our nigiri, which was nice and fresh tasting, and then the rest of our rolls that we had ordered. The chef had some extra yellow tail, so he made us a complimentary salad with it that included avocado and rice wine vinegar, it was fantastic! The fish was very fresh and flavorful, and the portions were very generous. We ordered too much and were stuffed by the end of the meal. We were however, able to fit in the complimentary mochi ice cream we were given. The service here was amazing, and we felt very welcomed. I would highly recommend Harumi Sushi!",

The sushi was good, but just \"good\", not what I would refer to as excellent.  I would have preferred it to be colder.  Was a little too warm.  Not the fried rolls, the California Roll and the Spicy Tuna roll.  (These should be cold).  This is only partly why I give three stars.  When we arrived, (just 2 of us), we requested a booth and we were quickly denied and told that they \"hold\" tables for regular customers.  I can understand that, (to some degree), but this restaurant basically \"holds\" all of the more desired tables/booths for so called \"regular customers\", so we got placed at the very back of the restaurant at a table where I felt somewhat trapped with no room to move behind me.  There were several empty tables where we asked to sit and were denied.  I'm surprised we weren't seated back on the shipping dock.  From where we were seated, I was able to fill my water cup from the ice machine. (Seriously).  So, three stars for the friendly staff, and the service was good, but I wouldn't eat here again unless I was stuck downtown with a serious sushi need.  I would try another place first.  If you do eat here, I would suggest the \"Arizona Roll\".  Very tasty.",

    "text": "At first, I thought it would be a regular restaurant, but it turned out to be quite different from what I expected.   First, you have a display where you can pick out any sushi rolls you want, or choose from a list to have them make it fresh. (I recommend you order from the rolls on the list). We ordered the Ahi Tower (included is a picture of our half-eaten Ahi Tower). It was savory and spicy and delicious, possibly one of the best I've had. I was pleasantly surprised that they used black rice instead of white rice, since I've heard black rice is much healthier.   Then, there is a section that kinda reminds me of Subway - you get to pick what goes in your bento box. I had a spicy chicken bento (only $7) with fried rice, vegetables, tofu, salad, tempura, and something I'm not sure how to describe - similar to a Korean side dish.   It's a very casual and small little place, and really good for working people who need to grab something to go.   The lemonade I got from the soda machine had a bad aftertaste, but I dumped it out and got the unsweetened tea instead, which tasted much better.   Also, I recommend you check-in to receive the free edamame and miso soup :)",

They tend toward the rolls more than a la carte, and use \"forbidden rice\" instead of white rice.  They have some creative rolls...the \"Oh My God\" roll is interesting, as it comes out flaming.  Fun.  Service was good, and it's a little unusual in their preparation.  If you're looking for traditional sushi, this may not be the place for you, but if you'd like something different, it's a cool place.",

After going inside, the obvious was great and we took a seat. I noticed at the chopsticks had the Kodo writing on it so I was very excited to learn that this is actually part of a restaurant group. I saw the owner wandering around he was really nice guy he came up and spoke to us. The food is excellent just like Kodo. They do the same thing with the purple rice. The fish was very fresh and delicious. The service was excellent and the food was incredible. I guess this was actually the original location. Awesome place will definitely go to it again when I am in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "Sushi is my favorite food and I've frequented many sushi restaurants around the world. I'm also quite knowledgeable about the subject having done a research paper on the topic and have educated many of my friends. Now, the point of this isn't to be conceited but to give context when I say this is one of my favorite sushi spots. Five stars, hands down, and I'm a harsh critic.  I was in downtown Phoenix for business recently and ended up stopping here during lunch one day due to the great reviews. When I showed up, the line was out the door and I knew I had made a good choice. I was a little put off by the order at the counter style of service as most sushi restaurants offer table side service but that didn't deter me.  My colleague and I got up to the front and ordered the sashimi combo with oasis roll, harumph roll, sex and the city roll, veggie tempura appetizer, miso soup, and green tea mochi. Looking back, that was way too much food, but so worth it.  The sashimi combo was amazing. The cuts of fish were thick and incredibly fresh and included salmon, tuna, yellowfin and ahi. All were equally tasty. In addition, the sashimi was topped with a small dollop of what tasted and looked like green onions mixed with wasabi. It added a whole new dimension to the fish that was very inventive. The oasis roll was also well made and fresh, especially as it is wrapped in thin sliced cucumber and had no rice. Perfect amount of sauce topped the roll and was a good companion to the sashimi.  The harumi roll was a bit intimidating at first as it uses purple rice. It made the coloring look a bit strange but it tasted amazing. Again, perfect combination of ingredients that came together into a monster roll. The sex and the city roll was also quite good but not nearly as good as the rest of the order.  After we finished we realized our appetizers had never come out. Upon mentioning it to the sushi chefs, they realized they had forgotten and immediately brought them out. We were already stuffed at that point but the veggie tempura was nicely done with a fresh dipping sauce world's apart from the sickly sweet stuff you might find at other restaurants. Also, we were given extra vanilla mochi and green tea ice cream on the house as they had run out of the green tea.  Great service, amazing food, and perfect dining spot. It was so good we even went back the next day for lunch and had another great experience experience. I wish this were in my home city so I could go all the time!",

Upon arrival the hostess/server told us that it shouldn't be more than an hour wait and that she could call us when a table opens up. This was not exactly the best thing to hear and felt like if that was the norm on a Saturday night than reservations should be recommended somewhere. Since we really really wanted to have the food, we gave her our number and left. After walking around the city we made our way back about 40 minutes later just to check in and see how much longer she thought it would be. When we came back in we just stood there and this other male finally came up to us and asked if we'd been helped. He sat us down and we filled out our menu. The server than came over, looked at our menu selections, and said the kitchen is closed, only sushi is served at dinner. Granted, I understand this is a sushi place and my boyfriend wanted sushi, however I wanted vegetable tempura and chicken teriyaki. Nowhere is it posted that the full menu is not served during the evenings. So after waiting all that time and having less than desirable service, we then find out I cannot order anything I wanted so we left. I am totally disappointed.",

My boyfriend and I were in town for the weekend and felt like sushi, and this was close and highly rated. We got there a little early to our reservation and were immediately seated. We ordered a few of the appetizers which were brought out in about five minutes (hot and freshly made, not like they had been sitting there or anything), and our rolls were brought out 5-10 minutes later. The food was great, and Juno (manager or head chef I assumed) was extremely entertaining. He not only sent us over some free samples, but he visited each table to make sure everything was satisfactory. He was cracking jokes the whole time, with the patrons and employees, which I found hilarious and really added to the overall experience. The waitresses were all very attentive and nice as well, each of them coming to check on us more than once. Ultimately, I can see why this place has such a high rating. I highly recommend you try this out if you're craving sushi and a good time, and I wish this place was in Denver :)",

It's small and not too easy to spot, but I was glad we found it. Inside was small, we were seated inches away from another couple right in front of the sushi bar, so it was a little distracting hearing everyone's conversations in our ears. Our server was from Japan and was very attentive and sweet. We tried a few rolls and some ngiri and we were surprised to see that the rice was purple! It was not only beautiful, it was delicious! The server explained that they use this special rice that is black before it cooks and it used to be only served to royals. This place was great and I will definitely come back.",

First off the black rice was a unique concept and they had it on tv to explain the Benefits of black rice .  We ordered a chirashi bowl and loved the presentation . The best part was that it had real wasabi .Ive actually never had real wasabi before. Chirashi was so good we ordered 2. We ordered Gyoza. The dipping sauce was very tasty and the outer skin on the Gyoza was tender and delicious . We also ordered two rolls , shrimp tempura roll  The ambience was nice and we were lucky to come right when it opened at 5 because as we ate it became busy fast .the waitress's was also super nice and helpful. I highly recommend this place!",

However we asked for a box and we're clearly finished eating and after about 10 min we finally asked for the check. (It was not busy and the waiter walked by several times already) he came back with the check, and walked away for about another 10 minutes. Lol.

The server asked us if we were really hungry, because each roll came with 10 pieces = AWESOME info!

It's a favorite for all special occasions and sushi cravings (They usually come in cycles and correspond with the full moon). The fish is always super fresh and the flavor combinations of their signature rolls will definitely familiarize your palate with umami. Hands down best sushi in PHX.",

When We got finished eating we were still in conversation and the workers kept asking us if we wanted more food and we kept saying no.

OMG roll: My absolute favorite. This arrives to your table wrapped in tinfoil and set on fire. The waiter or waitress unwraps the tinfoil, setting the fire out. The small fire adds a hint of a smokiness, like a light barbecue. I love this roll, and I think it's a steal at $13! This type of specialty roll would usually be pricier at other places. One roll is enough to fill me up!  H3 roll: This is also a delicious roll and priced the same as the OMG roll ($13). This was definitely spicier than the OMG roll, so if you're looking for something spicy, this is your roll. While this roll was also good, I prefer the OMG roll because of that delicious smoky flavor.  Service: We have always had friendly, attentive waiters. During one visit, Juno treated us to some complimentary green tea mochi ice cream! Last time, we got free miso soup & edamame (from the check-in offer), two free pieces of eel, and free ice cream!",

(insert valley girl reaction here)   I'm a fan of the H3 roll which is spicy tuna, spicy salmon and spicy yellowtail, and the Ahi Tower too which is more a rice bowl of sorts. What I love about this place is that it's unique in that their sushi is made with purple or forbidden rice. So it's better than white rice, and brown rice too. It's pretty much a sushi resto with exceptions during the weekday lunch hour where they also serve bento boxes. The seafood is fresh, good eats, and a great experience!",

And you will leave pretty full.   And fresh wasabi. You should definitely try it if you haven't yet. I can't stand the paste but eating it fresh is a whole different experience. It's worth the drive to downtown.",

The shrimp tempura was crisp and the sauce they sent with it was complex and multifaceted. The chirashi was some of the freshest I've eaten and the forbidden rice was delicious as well. I've always thought I hated wasabi, but it turns out I only hate powdered wasabi - the fresh stuff is delicious in moderation.",

Doesn't matter much what color the rice is, it has great consistency that doesn't take away from the quality of their rolls. Their fish is great as well. Very nice tuna. I am still blown away by how it was ready within 10 minutes of ordering, or how during the day you can just grab some to-go.   It is inexpensive. Rolls start at $7, and perhaps the best deal is the $15 mini roll combo that nets you 15 morsels that aren't significantly smaller than other dishes and can easily feed two people. All in a setting that's casual, but still very comfortable.   If you're ready to sacrifice a bit of sushi bar showmanship of larger establishments, Harumi is *the* place to go for a tasty dinner.",

I think this is an indication that this place cares about your experience and to this level of details.  I love the food , it is not similar to other sushi places, they have their own signature. I was happy to be there at3:45 , 15 minutes before they open and there were three groups of people waiting outside, it is amazing to have people waiting for you to open. The waiters are very friendly, you feel you are very welcomed. The location is very good, the price is very reasonable and the food is awesome.",

The main sushi chef is super friendly and offered us two fish samples (seared salmon and a fatty tuna, YUM) and a mochi green tea ice cream sample at the end of the meal. We are new to Phoenix and this will definitely be our go to sushi place.",

When you first walk in you are suppose to be greeted yet we walked in and the cashier stared at us for a while before asking how many of us there were. There was two of us we didn't get a choice in where we wanted to seat he just kind of pointed us to a table right by the entrance. His customer service skills lacked, after having sat there for another 8 min before we were noticed they came to ask for our drinks. they only provided us with 1 menu they have paper menus in which you mark what exactly you want. This took quite a bit of time since it was our first time here and we had to wait for each one of us to explore the menu. After finally waiting about 15 min for someone to come check on us we placed our order. The chef brought out a complimentary side dish to eat while we waited for our food. Presentation was nice, the fish was delightful. However when sushi rolls arrived all 3 of my sushi rolls were not fully rolled and came apart every time.",

This is proof positive that 99% of you wouldn't know good food if it bit you in the ass. As far as sushi in Phoenix is concerned, this is bottom of the barrel stuff. Sub-par, mushy, vinegary, rice (which should be the star) and the overly fishy fish is a no go. For sashimi, stay away! This is the only place I have ever spit out the hamachi sashimi. Garbage! The owner is definitely a good guy, no argument there, but that does not make up for crap food. If you are looking for top tier sushi/sashimi, do yourself a favor and hit up Hana, Roka Akor, Nobuo at Teeter House, Yasu, or even Hiro. If you are downtown and starving for sushi, hit up Moira. Moira is not the best around, but it is  leagues beyond this place! You can thank me later.",

The owner, bus boy and both servers made us feel like we were infringing on their ability to turn the table. We are talking every minute, on the minute. It felt extremely awkward and uncomfortable. The food was good, but these people lack tact. We were \"camping out\" no more than 20 minutes. We would have ordered another round along with dessert but I simply couldn't bare it any longer. To top it off, the 2 adjacent tables sat vacant for 10 minutes after their patrons had left. Will not be back.",

    "text": "Went here on a crowded Saturday night.  This place appears to be Korean owned and operated, which makes this sushi place authentic.  Though the food was good, not a bad bite in any of the dishes I had, I felt that the sashimi salad ($13) was too spicy.  The spicy salmon roll ($6) was a bargain though it is small.  The OMG roll ($13) large, which was recommended by a friend and on yelp, was basically a shrimp tempura roll with fake lobster salad and eel on top with spicy mayonnaise placed in foil and set ablaze for 5 minutes which when opened leaves a nice smokey BBQ type after taste.  Though it's good taste and texture are nothing to complain about, I would skip this a second time because it contains no raw fish and though the open flame at your table is cool, as a raw fish lover the OMG roll isn't for me nor is it for raw fish lovers I'm sure.  There are other large $13 rolls that have raw fish on their menu and I advise those instead.  I Also had the spicy scallops roll which was too spicy for me.  I also had the $13 salmon sashimi which is 8 large pieces with radish and it's good and again nothing to complain about.  I'll give Harumi a solid 4 stars because of food and service.  I can tell the waiters are really into their jobs and love what they do.  I never had to look for them and they always seemed to be paying attention to everything and everyone and if you did flag them down they help you even if she wasn't your waitress.  Also the purple/black rice is a departure from the more classic way rolls are made but this place knows what they are doing and it didn't affect texture or taste.  I'd go back.",

    "text": "Outstanding!    Small sushi shop downtown that is legit.  We ordered a little bit of everything. Here's the rundown: Spicy Tuna Tataki - 5 stars - Fresh with a spicy kick and smokey flavor.  Would order every visit Chefs Choice Sashimi - Very good.  Loved the spicy wasabi and tuna Gyoza - fresh, hot, soft with a nice dipping sauce Miso Soup - average but good portion for only $1.50 Phili Roll - excellent size, good balance of ingredients Green tea ice cream - creamy, fresh, lots of green tea flavor  Excellent service.  The waitress forgot our miso and I asked her for it and she apologized and said she won't charge me for it.  I offered to pay and she still took it off the bill.    The best was Chef Juno came out at the end of our meal and greeted us and asked us how we liked it.  I admire a chef that takes pride in his work and is personable.  He also came out and thanked us for coming and just had a great attitude.  We will be back.  Highly recommend!",

I went in way after the lunch rush, close to 2pm and asked for a table. They insisted I seat myself at the bar window area. I hate sitting on bar chairs. I pointed to the open tables and they pointed back to the bar area. I get it if it was lunch rush, but it wasn't. If the food was amazing, maybe I'd opt for seating I hate, but the food doesn't reach that level it's not fresh. Not worth it. There were several open tables so I turned around and left, bought lunch somewhere else.",

This place does not disappoint!   The quality of the sushi is quite good and they're known for some of their differences compared to other sushi places. One thing is that in some of their sushi courses, they use purple rice, which is a rice infused with beans of some kind. It's absolutely delicious. Also, what's so special about Harumi too is that they make their own wasabi. It's definitely worth the $2 to get.   Overall everything tastes great!!! The only things that might be a little hard on a customer is that it's a very small place, it won't seat that many people on a very busy day and it's quite expensive.",

The staff was also very friendly!  On top of that the food was superb!! They have omakase for $35.  It's not the traditional omakase where they serve you each sushi one at a time.  It comes all at once on a platter.  Every piece was fresh and delightful!  What's unique about the sushi here is the black rice.  It's healthier and did not take away from the texture or taste!  I'm just blown away!!! We also ordered the blue fin combo (melts in your mouth).   We also got to try what real wasabi tasted like.  Overall one of the best restaurant experience ever.  Brought me back to when I was in Japan.   Last but not least the mochi was the cherry  on top!   Wished they were located in NYC!",

They weren't that imoressive.  What I enjoyed: -OMG roll -Stuffed jalapenos -Salmon sashimi (hard to mess this up, nice fatty chunks) -Purple sushi rice (you don't have to ask for this, it comes with all rolls and, in my opinion, adds a whole other dimension to the roll because of its flavor)",

Omakase in Japanese means \"chefs choice\" in Japanese, which means that thce sushi chef gets to choose what he wishes to serve you. Usually this would cost at least $75 or more in other cities. Each piece of fish brought out was delicate, savory, and divine.  I also had the chance to try the nigiri combo plate which contains generous portion of delicious fish and a roll. Think that you will notice that it's different with the sushi joint is that they use purple rice, which adds special indescribable taste to any roll or nigiri.   My only complaint would have to be that the service was a bit curt, and they seem to be more interested in turning over tables then providing customer service. Regardless I will be back to consume epic amounts of fish.",

You can tell they use high-quality ingredients by the flavor and texture. My favorite dish of the night was the Super Crunch Shrimp. Wow. The breading was so crispy and just a touch sweet. The roll never fell apart even when I ate one piece a few bites at a time. I also ordered the Las Vegas roll, which was alright. I believe it was deep-fried, had cream cheese, jalapenos, and crab. And lastly, we ordered salmon sashimi. They gave us fat-ass, 1.5-inch slices of salmon. Just scrumptious.   Bad stuff:  The worst service. Although they seemed to be fully staffed, the servers still looked very overwhelmed. My girlfriend and I both ordered hot tea. A male server brought it to us, warning us it was hot. He was very shakey and spilled the hot tea he warned us about over my thighs. Thank goodness I was wearing shorts and his warning was inaccurate--the tea was warm, not hot. I know the restaurant was busy, but we shouldn't have to ask for utensils or napkins. We did. They also barely checked on us and we had to wave down associates to get even the slightest attention.   Truth be told, I'd come back and even recommend to a friend. But, try to be more attentive and aware when it comes to customer service, please.",

Each roll was really big and full of fresh fish.  The purple rice was something new that I haven't seen before, it tasted delicious and was a nice touch of something different.  The udon noodles were tasty, I tried a few bites.  My friend thought the broth was a bit too salty, though.   Everything came out really quickly, which was good considering how hungry I was.  The service was also very speedy, and our waiter checked in on us fairly often.  Would definitely recommend this place!",

They serve their sushi with purple rice, which was a treat, and added a unique flavor to the fish.  Prices: reasonable sushi prices, the sushi (2 pcs) will run you about $5 while the rolls range from $8 to 12.  Parking: there's metered street parking on Monroe Street, and a paid lot on W. Adams St.  People: fun for all. This is a great date spot.  Perks: the sushi tastes very fresh, and they also serve beer and wine. The staff were friendly, and this location was open on MLK day. This is mainly a sushi restaurant (although they do serve udon) so you shouldn't expect any dishes like chicken teriyaki. They do have a wide variety of appetizers though.",

Rolls were not to big (at least mine were) some were giant like in the picture (not all rolls got a picture, still training friends, haha).  Rice was cooked to perfection. Ive never had purple/black rice before and I really loved it. Great sticky yet smooth texture too.   Smaller place, but what sushi place isn't! We all fit and then some, you make it work when you are HANgry and want sushi. Ordered some drinks and we were waiting on a few more people to join us. They were super fast with drinks and food. Some orders got a little confusing but they fixed it in the end.  ALL STAFF were super helpful and really nice. They answered all of our questions (gluten free advise for some) and made it a very nice experience.   Defiantly have to come back to this place for my husband to try out!",

This place has pretty much turned me into a sushi snob. I'm cool with that though!   The restaurant is pretty small and there is often a 10-15 minute wait for a table during weekend dining hours. Definitely worth it though. If it's busy we just put our name on the list, walk next door for a drink at the bar and then come back for dinner. Never had an issue.   If you're near downtown, just do it.",

    "text": "Kudos to Chef Juno for a phenomenal sushi joint in downtown Phoenix! Purple rice is outstanding - high quality, mouthwatering, beautiful sushi. Harumi is sushi interpreted creatively for excellent results - fresh ingredients combined with Chef Juno's creative talent. For those who like heat, get the fresh wasabi for a tasty kick.   Crazy roll - fresh tuna, salmon, avocado, spicy mayo, topped with masago wrapped  in soy paper. Refreshing, excellent quality.  Omg roll (Oh my god roll) - worth the hype! Truly omg! Happy child of all good flavors. Shrimp tempura, crab salad with shrimp and eel, spicy mayo, eel sauce, tobiko. The roll is wrapped in tin foil and lit aflame tableside - comes out fully cooked with a nice smokey flavor. A great option for those who aren't quite into raw sushi - delicious either way!  Ahi tower - the Godzilla of ahi towers, a flavor explosion! Spicy tuna on a giant bed of crab salad on top of purple sushi rice, crowned with fresh avocado slices, tobiko and masago, dressed with eel sauce and spicy mayo. Generous portion to share for 3-4.  Very reasonable prices - such a steal for delicious sushi and a super fun experience! Went on Saturday night no wait!",

    "text": "BEST Accidental find EVER!!.  My GF and I went to eat at Noodles downtown, but they closed weeks prior and we noticed this small such place a couple doors down. When you walk it, you immediately notice how packed this place was. As a foodie, I have always correlated good asian restaurants being filled with asian patrons. Don't know how scientific that is, but I, as an Asian, gravitate to good Asian cuisine places and I make assumptions that others do too.  When you walk in, you are greeted immediately with a smile and an estimated wait time. Seating is typical of hole in the wall diners and we got a small table in the middle of the restaurant. We received beverages immediately and ordered appetizers. Gyoza was mediocre and I wish the tea was not powder green tea.  We ordered the traditional spicy tuna roll and it was fantastic. the black rice was not typical sticky rice, but seemed appropriate and tasty. We ordered, my personal favorite, toro at that time and it was not disappointing. My GF and I were squabbling over the last pieces so we had to order another. The Chef saw us play arguing and ordering, and he included an \"extra\" portion for us.   Major points for this place. I like that Harumi proves that you don't have to have an expensive venue in a luxury environment to have a 5 star experience. What makes this a 5 star is because the service NEVER stopped. This is one of the most seamless transitions between all waitstaff and food runners I have seen in a while. The food was amazing, and the chef customizing our Toro order put it over the top. I don't know what it cost the restaurant to put the three extra pieces of toro on our plate, but I intend to make up that loss with repeat visits. By far, this tops all other sushi restaurants I have eaten at in Phoenix.",

Last night (Friday night) I walked by the restaurant and there was people waiting outside waiting to be seated, which to me was a good sign of good food. I decided to come on Saturday when they open up at 4pm.  The server helped me pick out a cold snake based on my likings. Unfortunately I don't remember the name of it but it was a cold, unfiltered snake that was peach flavored, it tasted amazing.  I ordered the Combo mini rolls where you have a choice of 3 rolls to pick (they give you a choice out of 6 or 7 rolls). I picked the Dynamite, Spicy Tuna and Arizona Roll. All 3 of them were tasty. I am glad that I had read previous reviews so that I was prepared that the rice it comes with is black rice. It didn't alter taste it just made it look special!!! I also ordered the Albacore which was right on point!!  I walked to restaurant so I'm not positive on parking situation but I think you might need to pay for parking if you come here or parking will be limited.  This definitely a must try sushi restaurant if you're in downtown Phoenix!",

FOOD I enjoyed pretty much everything we ordered: 1. Miso soup --$1.50 2. Oasis Roll + 6 Sashimi -- $17 3. Rainbow Roll -- $11 4. Over the Rainbow -- $15 would skip this if you're on the fence  5. Omakase -- $36 dinner only  SERVICE The ordering process was quick and our food came out at different times, but it was prompt. Water was decent, but unfortunately, the waiter never returned to fill up our empty glass. One waitress was silly and as I was leaving, she said \"see you tomorrow!\" In reference to the amount of food I had ordered and photos I took.  ATMOSPHERE We were seated towards the back, where there were some Christmas lights hanging on the side of the empty part of the wall, usually used to keep plants. It looked a bit tacky, but whatever, I'm here for the food. The place was a bit snug, and the lighting wasn't the best, so it was tough to get any nice foodie photos.   PARKING Located downtown, the only options are parking lots or meter street parking. You either want to have a handful of change or you will need to install the app on your phone. From what I remember, I think its $0.25 for 10 mins. We didn't need more than 1-1.5 hrs.",

Went for my birthday and it was just a lot of fun, one of the best nights out I've had in a while. This restaurant treated me like family going above and beyond what I would typically expect.  The omakase I got was amazing, each piece was fresh full of flavor. There was plenty of variety and almost every piece was a super premium item. Each bite was almost magical. I felt like this plate elsewhere would easily go for at least double what I paid.   Chef Juno is a lot of fun. You can tell that he really enjoys what he does and his energy is infectious. Every time I've visited, he always sits down and makes sure you're having a good time too. He's also really generous sometimes giving free samples which are really tasty.",

    "text": "I have been here 3 times so far, and all 3 times have been absolutely delicious... and best sushi I have had in Phoenix by far.   If you check-in, you get free Edamame and Miso Soup, which isn't too shabby. The edamame is very warm when it comes out, but they may add a wee bit too much extra salt on them for seasoning. Miso soup is standard.   The beauty of this place is in their unique and elaborately designed rolls. My favorite is easily the Oasis roll, which has a refreshing vinegar-cucumber wrap (opposed to the typical seaweed wrap) around more refreshing crab and salady-goodness. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water and want to go back again soon.   Their traditional rolls are even special because of its use of purple rice. The rice is soft and delicious and just fascinating to eat. H3 rolls, Las Vegas Roll, Dynamite Rolls... some mango roll... all so flavorful.   The salmon nigiri..is just. so. good, too... I don't know how they make it seem like it's fresh because Phoenix definitely isn't close to any waters.... But the presentation is so clean and the amount of ginger used to speckle the top is perfection.  The waitress is also awesome. She is so hyped up with energy somehow and pleasantly nice. Very good demeanor even when it's busy and she is scurrying around everywhere.   The only odd part is the bathrooms are out the back door... and through more back doors.   I saved this place to be my 100th Yelp review. :)",

Love it, just wished I knew what the hell they were saying. The decor and ambiance isn't the most intimate, but you really don't come here for that. This is the breakdown of the sea carnage that went down at our table of 2.   Toro - Not always available, we jumped at the opportunity to indulge in the belly of beast! Melts in your mouth delicious!!!  Shrimp Tempura - Tempura is always touchy for me. The batter is everything and a lot of times its too thick. Harumi's tempura was perfect! Almost as good as my favorite place in Maui (Sansei).   Stuffed Jalapenos - You did what with that pepper? You stuffed it with crab and tempura'd that garnish from south of the border? Yeah, and it works.   Ramen - Hey, you can't pass up an chance to have Ramen that isn't out of a bag! We really didn't expect the kick that this ramen had, but luckily for me it was so spicy that it was all mine to slurp and gulp!! No dry seasoning packets used in this bowl. Awesomeness.  Service is fast and friendly! Thanks for a great night Harumi. Will definitely be back to try so many other items.",

Most of the wait staff are from Japan which adds an authentic touch that is missing from most AZ sushi joints.   They also offer Asahi Super Dry from Japan in giant cans,  not that Canadian wanna-be bottled Asahi found everywhere else. Decent selection of cold Saki,  including the cloudy Nigori. Nice!  We ordered a double Omakase ... Oh- My- Goshi!  Words cannot to justice for the Sushi ... so here are some pictures.

No explanation for the delay was given, until I was preparing to stop a waitress at the counter and ask if we had been forgotten. Then she said \"Oh, we're short a chef today\" (although I counted six people working on the line in the kitchen, and others' food came out before ours did). Well, if that's True, you should be up front with irritated customers wondering if they have been forgotten. Next, the check didn't appear until we asked, again just before I was going to approach the counter and ask for it again. Finally, the water was never refilled... I would have asked, but never got a chance, as the waitress never came back to the table during the meal.   Too bad, I had been looking forward to trying it for a long time. But I won't be back, I don't have a long enough lunch hour to deal with unpredictable and forgetful service.",

To use the restroom, you have to walk through their screened off \"storage\" area at the back of the restaurant, past the guys trying to bleach the ice machine, outside, and down the breezeway connected with the kitchens of other restaurants to a bizarre one-stall bathroom.

It came with rice, really tasty chicken, veggies, a little side salad and 2 pieces of tempura. Used to go 3-4 times a month and then they changed it. Now they only serve sushi. I am not a fan of sushi and have not gone back since they changed their menu. It is always packed so the sushi must be good",

It's hard to explain or understand how a hole in the wall in downtown Phoenix that uses purple rice (really black rice) can beat the pants off Sushi of Gari in New York. We ate salmon sashimi (8 pieces for $12), tuna, yellowtail, eel and scallop sushi with fresh wasabi (about $5.50 for two pieces) and an Ahi tower. The sushi was fresh, fresh, fresh. The owner Juno visited our table and brought us Mochi ice cream for dessert. Dinner for two was $100. A similar meal at Sushi of Gari cost me more than three times the price. They don't take reservations so we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. Worth the wait.",

The HB3 ( I might have that wrong) was this kinda spicy avocado topped thing, great. The Oasis was cucumber wrapped something inside, great. Had to try their rainbow roll, great. The tip I can give is to get the sashimi app, which gives you 3 pieces of four fish for $13. It was plenty, instead of individual orders of sashimi. Prices were so reasonable, rolls are huge and so fresh looking and tasting. 2 small bottles of sake. $70. We thought it was great.",

The moment I stepped foot into the joint, I felt so comfortable. The staff were using simple Japanese and seemed to appreciate when I complimented them in their language. The atmosphere is partially casual, but honestly, you can make a night at Harumi into any sort of occasion. I'd go there alone, dressed up for clubbing with my girls, or on an intimate date. It's really what you make of it. The food.... The rolls are incredible. You know when you go to sushi and it takes 15-20 minutes for your first plate to come out? Well, say goodbye to that poor service and even poorer quality of food. Before I could slip in another order, I had a steaming hot plate of gyoza at my fingertips, within 60 seconds of placing the order. I swear to you the potstickers were still sizzling. We tried the Harumi and the Oh My God rolls. Nothing beats the smoky essence permeating the tangy-fresh flavors of the OMG roll, which is set on fire at a table-side presentation. The signature Harumi roll is mild enough for finicky eaters, yet an adventurous roll for those who enjoy a great dollop of wasabi on their bite. I was lucky enough to sample the mochi green tea ice cream, which is palate-cleansing and as authentic of a dessert that I've encountered in the US. Give Harumi a shot!",

We ordered a variety of rolls and many used way too much cream-cheese. Some of them even fell apart. The miso, gyoza, and seaweed salad were also uninspired. We spent about $110 between the two of us.  The service wasn't great either. The place was maybe 2/3 full and it took the waiter more than 10 minutes to even greet us at our table.

This was OMFG awesome sushi. I ordered \"omakase\" as I had learned to in Japan, which is basically saying, \"Chef's choice\". He came out later to apologize for making so much - for the $25 I had two rolls plus about 10 pieces of sashimi too. It was all AMAZINGLY fresh. Turns out, he's from Osaka, and was very impressed and honored by my knowledge of Japanese customs. Apparently few order \"omakase\", which is the standard way to do it in Japan.  Great service.

    "text": "I'm really picky when it comes to sushi, I was more than a little suspect when we walked in at 8 pm last night and the place was empty.   The entire staff was there to help, with one gentleman in particular, who I think owned the place, was super nice and very helpful.  We started out with the stuffed jalepeno and shrimp tempura. Holy heck (insert other four letter word here). The jalepeno was actually a fresh, crunchy jalepeno! The tempura came out too hot to eat! IT WAS SO DAMN GOOD! Seriously!  Moving on, we ordered the arizona roll and the harumi roll. I haven't had fresher fish anywhere other than Hawaii. I'm kind of a fish snob, and I fully endorse this place. The rolls are made with black rice, which is much more nutrient-friendly than white, and also cooks to purple, adding a lovely spin to the sushi, as well as adding a slight crunch.  For two people, we ordered a beer, a hot sake, two appetizers and two rolls (that were the size of skinny burritos) and the total came to just under $50. This is do moderately priced I couldn't even believe it!   I could not recommend this place more, this place is going to be my regular go-to for to-go from here on out.....GO THERE RIGHT NOW!",

Our first step through the door we were acknowledged and quickly seated. Ordering was a cinch as all you had to do was record the quantity of your order on a ticket that doubled as your menu. We ordered the tempura shrimp and tempura vegetables as appetizers. I had the ikura nigiri and the shrimp ramen. Both tempura appetizers were delicious and we loved them. My salmon roe was fresh and the seaweed that wrapped my nigiri was crisp and fresh. For those of you that love spicy soups, the shrimp ramen was yummy.  If you don't mind the drive into downtown phoenix, Harumi sushi is worth it. You definitely won't be disappointed.",

My wife and I ate the same (boring huh) dish and each had the Nigiri with spicy tuna rolls (9 piece) and to say it was great would be an understatement.  To be honest my wife and I both said this is the BEST sushi either one of us have ever had and this is saying a lot because we lived in Hawaii for a long time.  It's cool how they do it.. (spoiler alert) the rice is dyed a natural almost purpleish blue and it just works.  Texture, taste and freshness were unbeatable, I'd give it try if I were you.  We'll be back and often too.",

    "text": "Purple rice?! Whaaaaaaaa?  Harumi Sushi is one of the newer treasures I've come to find in downtown Phoenix. The owner, \"Sexy Juno\", and his team serve up some of the best sushi I've had in Phoenix thus far.  I personally prefer the Crazy Roll and Sex and the City Roll - but honestly, I can't imagine that anything they serve that you might be eyeing would steer you wrong. And the purple rice..... not sure what it is that makes it so yum-o but it is super delicious.  I also LOVE that this place serves the real-deal-nasal-passage-clearing wasabi on their sushi pieces. If you haven't had the privilege of having the good stuff - and just that pasty green goop they serve at most other places, give it a whirl.... But it's not for the faint at heart (Harumi does have the other stuff too, just in case you're a wimp). Of course, a sake bomb or two could easily solve this problem for you.  The only gripe I have is I wish it was open later. Granted, nothing downtown is really open late enough when it comes to food, so it's not a big issue. But sometimes it would be nice to be able to pop in for a late night fix. I've seen they have some quick grab-n-go options throughout the day. So if you want a late night bite it might be worth grabbing one and popping it in the fridge at home for later.  Keep it up sexy Juno! You and your team rock!",

The usage of black rice sets them a step above your average sushi restaurant, while the cramped quarters make you feel right at home. The chicken dumplings are crispy, delicate, and a True culinary joy. The Crab Mania is a thoroughly unoffensive, yet adventurous choice. Thrill seekers should dabble in the Arizona roll. And True risk takers should order the hot sake to tie their meal all together. For in house entertainment, don't forget to watch the waiter light rolls on fire above the trash can. This was truly a jubilant experience that must be had by all!",

I ordered the California roll and shared an order of stuffed jalapenos and gyoza with my friend. I was so full. Also I loved the black rice. It made it super aesthetic and added a different texture than rice normally has but it was definitely a positive thing. The staff was super friendly and was around often to refill our waters and ask us if we needed anything. In fact, for me the staff are what made this restaurant really stand out and the reason why I would totally come again and recommend it to anyone. My friend and I were coming from school so we had our backpacks. We were seated at a 2 person table and were just going to put our bags on the ground when the staff brought over 2 more chairs so that we didn't have to place our backpacks on the ground. Anyway, if you're looking for a sushi place with good food and friendly staff, Harumi is the place to go.",

My problems during my experience include: poor customer service, one of my parties orders wasn't correct, and lack of ac.   I arrived at 6:55pm one evening and waited to be seated for my party of 3. I was not offered a seat to wait; however just watched as 7 parties that arrived after me were sat. After almost 40 minutes, I was asked if I wanted a sit in a seat by the window until it was time. My party was no seated until after 7:40. I would suggest just being more conscious of customers. With no ac and standing, I had sweat quite a bit so I was gross for dinner.  We ordered one of the rolls that is lit on fire at your table but it was still cold in the center so didn't cook all the way through.   Other than that. It was a cool experience.

We came to this restaurant and put down our names; we were hungry, but we could last the 15-25 min wait. 40 minutes later, we went to check on the status of our seat. We found that our name had been crossed off their list.  Having been appolagized to and told it would be only 15 more minutes, we settled in to wait a bit longer. After 25 minutes of hearing nothing from the staff, we went to investigate again. We were told they were closing. They wouldn't seat us.  Incompetent and infuriating, the staff wasted our time, and by the time they were done fucking us, other restaurants nearby were closed. Why isn't there an option for zero stars? That's what we got from Harumi.",

Needless to say the quality of fish is great however, the customer service is awful. Thinking  the first time was a fluke and the fish being so good, I visited this restaurant twice while being in town for a week.    Our second visit was worse than our first. We arrived for lunch about fifteen minutes after they opened and was seated immediately. After we ordered a sashimi appetizer and twenty minutes later, I got up to ask how much longer. Turns out the waiter forgot to put in our order! With one other table with customers I was very disappointed. No \"I'm sorry or a complimentary soup\" either. We finally got our appetizer which was delicious but wouldn't go back.    I'm sure there are other sushi restaurants in AZ that are just as good of quality but with better customer service.",

    "text": "Was happy to find out there was no wait at 7pm on a Friday night.  Came here specifically because they used the purple Korean rice for their sushi rolls. I liked the appearance and taste of the rolls!  The purple rice was very soft but not sure if it really taste different than white rice.  I would need to try them side by side to tell any difference.  Best part was the fresh fish - definitely the freshest I've had in AZ.  The tuna was deep blood red and made me want it even though I don't usually go for tuna.    Crazy Roll - my favorite roll.  Soft, fresh, with soy paper. The Crunchy Mango roll and H3 roll - good but tasted similar and had spicy mayo and eel sauce overkill.  Spider roll - disappointed as crab pieces so small you can barely taste it. Oasis roll - wrapped with cucumber and impossible to eat as a \"roll\" since it immediately falls apart. Taste only okay too. Nigiri - salmon, tuna, and yellowtail all amazing and fresh  Seared salmon nigiri - YUM!  Had a great smokey taste and was compliments of the chef! Spicy scallop nigiri -  one large slice instead of mini scallops. Had fake crab on top (my pet peeve -__-).  Chef also gave our toddler a plate of rice, fake crab, whipped cream, avocado, and cucumber to enjoy.  Overall a good experience but wish they had yellowtail in their rolls. Will come back but order more sashimi vs rolls for the fresh fish.",

I normally rate sushi restaurants based on three criteria: quality, price, quantity. The service is not something I care about too much unless it is unbearable whenever I go to restaurant.   This place seems to have the highest ratings among all criteria comparing to other restaurants. Sure there are better quality fish restaurants or more authentic but the price is normally high. I find this place have the best quality and quantity for the money you spend.   I would recommend getting the salmon sashimi/nigiri, smoked salmon nigiri, eel bowl if you want to just have something filling, and the best would be toro nigiri (it is so cheap comparing to other places).   This location has a more small/local/downtown feeling as it is quite small, parking is in the back. If you want a more upscale atmosphere, go to Kodo instead. They are all pretty consistent in their quality between different locations.  I have had time when I got extra sashimi/nigiri on the house from this location and random samples from the kodo location.",

Right as we walked in, we saw everyone moving swift, the staff all welcomed us, and there was a group getting cheered on for their OMG roll. The ambiance was very lively.  The food is delicious and comes out fast. Literally within 5-10 minute of ordering our food, we received our meal.  The use of forbidden rice adds a unique experience to the the taste of each roll. Even the basic California roll tasted better here. It's a very refreshing take on sushi rice - perfect texture, flavor, and consistency.  We ordered gyozas, the California roll, the salmon roll, the mango roll, the Harumi roll, and the OMG roll, and the special of the day (bluefin combo, which came with toro sashimi, bluefin nigiri, and bluefin roll). The everything about the bluefin combo, the OMG, and Harumi were amazing - fresh and flavorful.  IMO, the OMG is the best cooked roll I've tried.",

    "text": "Yelp showed this place closing at 9PM. I went around 745PM so I'd miss the dinner rush but not get there too late to piss off the kitchen staff. As I walked up I noticed the place was packed. Literally, there was a line out the door. Luckily the line was made up of parties larger than 2 so I walked up and they sat me at the only open table in the place, a 2 top by the door.  I ended up ordering a seaweed salad and the 5 Nigiri + Crazy Roll. The seaweed salad made it out pretty quick. It was your standard seaweed salad served in a bowl over a small bed of daikon. When the entree came out I was caught off guard as the Crazy Roll had purple rice. I'd never seen that before. I took a quick peak around the restaurant and everyone that had rolls with rice had purple on their plate. I don't think they serve white rice. It wasn't an issue; just a little change from the norm. After the fact, I noticed a small TV above the host stand that had a rotating video calling it Forbidden Rice. I did a little research and apparently Forbidden/Black rice is better for you then brown rice and is low-gluten. The nigiri and the crazy roll were excellent.  I was a little weary of sushi in Phoenix but this was pretty good. Next time I'm in town and I stay at the Hilton Garden Inn I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "(Simple Minds - Don't You Forget About Me)  Won't you come see about me? I'll be alone, Yelping you know it baby Show me your sushi and rolls  Giving me everything inside and out and Rice's strange so real and it's dark Think of the tender things that they're are rolling up  Downtown may pull us apart But when the food gets into your heart, BoBites  Don't you forget Harumi Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't you forget Harumi  I've heard a lot about this place and finally made my way DT to give it a try.  I was not disappointed.  Now I did go to their sister restaurant, Kodo, in Scottsdale so I was definitely well prepared to expect greatness.  Harumi and small sushi joint in the heart of DT.  I came after I was released during jury duty so I took advantage of my free parking pass!  To start I ordered their lunch special, Ahi Tower, Nigiri, and Stuffed Jalapeno.  The Nigiri here is well portioned and wrapped around the rice like a blanket; the fish itself was like butter and temperature was warm to the palates.  The Stuffed Jalapeno was different for me since I thought it, but it definitely had the texture I was shooting for with crispy cover and fresh tuna bite along with imitation crab.  It was drizzled with chipotle mustard giving it a spicy kick.  As for the Ahi Tower, it was a mound of their signature purple rice along with Ahi Tuna and topped with Tobiko and imitation crab.  This took me a while to eat, but it was definitely worth your while if you're into quantity.  I barely finished it off myself, but had to suck up my big boy appetite to finish it off!  In the end, Harumi like their sister restaurant definitely has a formula for solid sushi in the valley.  Its signature purple rice is a solid start, but how they roll and serve up some raw delight is well received! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "The top Nigiri, Roll, Sashimi Restaurant In Downtown Phoenix.  Get there when it opens at 4pm if you don't want to wait.  Street parking is $1.50 per hour before 8pm.  Affordable fresh fish with colorful brown instead of white rice...  Ordered a lot of food since we just finished walking through the Matsuri Festival in Heritage Square and didn't see sushi meeting our tastes.  Thus ordered:  - Oh My God Roll - their flaming signature $13 roll in which Servers want you to say \"Oh My God!\" with them when they flame up the roll.  Acquired taste for this roll as some like the smokey taste while others will say it tastes like lighter fluid.  Definitely a gimmick for those on a date- flamin' hot, hot, hot.  - Unagi Donburi, a $19 mound of Unagi on brown rice with sauce and Avocado.  Around 12 large pieces...  really nice!  - Toro Sashimi, four large pieces for $18, fresh, fresh, velvety, velvety.... repeating for emphasis.  - Crazy Roll & Nigiri (5 Pieces) Combo - $17, beautifully plated, Tuna, Salmon, Avocado, Masago Wrapped In edible Soy Paper, while the Nigiri were composed of large pieces of salmon and tuna  - Spider Roll- $11 which was a Soft Shell Crab Roll, this was ok...  And FRESH ground wasabi for $2...  A beautiful, fresh fish, feast with excellent service!  Definitely tops in Downtown Phoenix.",

Based on other reviews and my husbands recommendation, I ordered two of the seared salmon nigiri and also the OMG roll. I have to say both were incredible. Tasty, satisfying, fresh, interesting, and altogether delicious. The seared salmon had a touch of spice which I normally don't like, but it was beautiful as part of the overall taste. The salmon melts in your mouth. The OMG presentation was cool but the flavor was even better and I loved the combination of the cooked bottom and cool top.   Easily the best sushi I've ever had. The staff are attentive and friendly. I love that! Only one critical observation - I wish the ambiance was a little cozier. it's pretty dive-y which is only appropriate  for super casual dining. Still, five stars.",

    "text": "If you find yourself in the Phoenix area this place is fantastic.  I would highly recommend calling in for a reservation.  Keep in mind that they give you a 5 minute grace period, if your later than 5 minutes they will give up your table.  When you see how busy they are, you'll understand why they can't keep a table open.     Pros: Sushi is really good and tastes fresh.  Very impressive.    They use forbidden rice which gave the sushi a distinct flavor, but not overpowering.    We had the Rainbow roll, veggie roll, California roll, asparagus roll, tuna sashimi, tuna, salmon, scallop, yellowtail sushi orders - all of it was great!!   Pricing is awesome: we ordered all the above and 2 large beers and 2 ice teas, 4 miso soups and an order of edamame and we paid $120 with the tip.  (Sushi order - We ordered two of each sushi listed above)   Cons:  Just one - service is a little awkward.  I wouldn't call it bad, just disorganized.  Check your bill before paying, we were charged for 2 rainbow rolls, when we ordered only one.  But that's because we had 3 different servers - I don't think that was by design. But if you can be patient with the disorganization, the food is completely worth it.    The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the service.  But the food itself is 5 star quality.",

The restaurant is a little hidden, but we were able to find it.  The place was pretty busy when we went in, but we were instantly greeted. We started off with the Oh my god roll because it simply sounded good, and OH MY GOD, IT WAS AWESOME!  It came super quick, wrapped in aluminum foil that was on fire. It looked super good, and tasted amazing. It had a kick to it, and mmmm I could eat another one right now.  After that, we ordered the H3 Roll. It was a lot spicier, still good, but definitely not as good as the first one.   Maybe we were just hungry, or we were surprised by the fact that the sushi came on fire. But man, I would definitely go back again!",

    "text": "Best sushi in Phoenix! I have been let down by several sushi restaurants here in the valley before but Harumi will definitely not disappoint! It is a very casual restaurant that is great for lunch and dinner. Several reviews here suggested that the food here is far superior to the casual atmosphere, which may have some merit behind it, however, I think the casual ambience is one of the best aspects of this restaurant. Remaining a casual restaurant allows anyone to come in for a casual lunch or singles or couples to stop in for dinner without having to make a whole night out of it.   Chef Juno and his team are very skilled at their craft. As for the wait staff, I think they could use a little more training and a refresher on their knowledge of menu.  Tonight we checked-in on Yelp and received a free order of miso soup and edamame. Both were delicious! For our entires we ordered the H3 roll and the Oh My God roll. The H3 had a great spicy kick. The Oh My God roll is served on a flaming plate and wrapped in tinfoil. It is quite a sight to see! This is a must try for anyone who has not been here before. It is very savory and smokey roll that will satisfy any craving.  For dessert I was considering the green tea ice cream tempura, but before we could order Juno sent an order of the green tea mochi on the house. He is so nice to his costumers! The mochi was good, but I would have liked to have tried it without the chocolate sauce.  I would highly recommend Harumi for anyone who is looking for a great casual sushi restaurant.",

Although we didn't make reservations we were seated right away however it took about 35 mins to be waited on. The table we were seated on was rickety and would tilt back and forth. When we asked to move to the next one we were told very rudely to push the tables together and move to the next one because originally that's how they are supposed to be. So there after. .. we ordered drinks which took another 15 mins plus ordering our food.. We could see that we weren't the only ones having bad service. . This was our first time there.   Service bad; food good but not rolled tightly enough to hold.  May give it another chance TBD.",

We got the stuffed jalepenos and super crunch crab to start.  Omg... amazing.  For rolls we got the crab mania, spider roll and  OMG roll that they set aflame at your table to barbecue the eel.

    "text": "When hubby and I visit a sushi place for the first time, we make it a point to order the Omakase (leaving your gastronomic fate in the sushi Chef's expert choices ;-) ). And that's exactly what we set out to do. We called it our Appetizer platter. The server named each of the sashimi and sushi nigiri that the Chef prepared for us. But as soon as she left, we wasted no time and dig in into our little pockets of joy using our chopsticks. We asked for fresh wasabi, too. The fresh and herb-y and citrusy and slightly bitter flavor of fresh wasabi is worlds apart from prepared wasabi, for sure! Well worth the try, really. Place does get super packed. When we called, we were told they were not busy (yet), and that was at 7:30 on a Friday evening. When we arrived at 8:00, they got very full and very busy! But no worries, the staff greeted us, and immediately made us feel \"right at home\". The place is relatively small and narrow, but our table towards the back of the restaurant was comfortable and not as tightly packed and claustrophobic as the ones upfront.  Finding parking might be a bit tough (since they are close to the Orpheum), so plan to spend some time to hunt down a parking space nearby. On to the purple rice. There's an overhead TV by the cash register which explains why it's better than white or brown rice for you--its rich in antioxidants and minerals, and has been dubbed an anti-cancer superfood. Well, I still will remain fond of the traditional vinegar'd white rice (I prefer its sticky texture over the drier and nuttier flavor of the purple rice. But don't take my word for it. Gotta try it and then you form your own opinion about it).  So, once again, the Omakase plate is worth every cent of the $35.00 price tag. Hubby and I ordered not one but TWO Omakase plates. It's that great! This is our sushi place whenever we are in Phoenix from now on. Until we find the next wonderful sushi place",

Greated with a welcome smile, complimentary appetizer which teased our palates with fresh and spicy tuna and our order in...We devoured the mango roll, one of our faves, jalapeno appetizer which was beautiful combination of spicy and creamy with a hint of sweet eel sauce...followed by rich miso soup that was fully deep of flavor. OK, maybe not in that order, I can't recall ...It was all an experiential blur of fresh, delightful food. As we proceeded through nigiri cephalopod selection (Ika and Tako), sweet ebi and comforting unagi....We couldn't resist asking the chef to honor us with their choice and arrived shortly was a masterpiece of roe-balls that had earthy rice and popping pearls and whatever wizardry the sashimi wraps were provided. Did I say we wanted quality? I'm fairly certain the family in town have a new request in future and I'm left thinking I don't come here often enough.  Well done all involved this evening. Amazing!",

We decided to eat at this joint because the reviews were good and we were willing to wait a little bit for good sushi.   Well I walked in and mind you no one else was waiting. There were two empty tables which could seat two. And imagine that we were a party of two.  I approached the hostess who had a panicked and disinterested look beset her face and she basically said we can't seat you sorry. I asked her how long the wait was, she said an hour then again said I can't seat you. I pointed at an empty table and two empty barstools on the outskirts of the room. She said no those are reserved.   I get it. It's Superbowl weekend. But at least give me the courtesy of the option to wait for a table to open up.  It doesn't seem wise to turn down potentially good business --especially not one from the likes of me who would have ordered for 4 people and made them some money.  The scowl on the hostess's face and her demeanor-just unacceptable.",

I said it wasn't a problem, but then a few minutes later the hostess sits another couple at the booth we had just been sitting at. Apparently the larger group wouldn't fit in a booth. I think it's a little rude we weren't offered our seats back. We were instead at a much smaller and cramped table. My waiter even seemed a little confused about why we weren't moved back.

    "text": "First off, I lived in Vancouver, Canada for a long time before moving to the US 3yrs ago and therefore am quite picky about my sushi. Second, I moved to Spokane, WA, which is an amazing small, big city but one thing it's lacking is a good variety of Asian restaurants. Therefore, whenever I travel for work, I always look up the Asian restaurant offerings and get my fill.    Much to my dismay, downtown Phoenix did not have a lot of Asian restaurants either. Upon finding Harumi on Yelp and getting good reviews, and since there really wasn't a lot of choices, I gave it a try.   I went there with two other colleagues, who both lived in LA area, and we did it family style. We ordered some nigiri, sashimi, a couple of hand rolls, and three rolls. They didn't have any special fish that day (Tuesday), as they get their shipment on Wednesdays. Everything we ordered was delicious. The rice is purple, as most have commented, but the texture and chew is not any different than normal sushi rice. The nigiri and sashimi all smelled and tasted fresh, with very generous pieces.   I was so impressed that I did return there the next day, especially since I was really craving some toro. Ordered slightly different items on my second visit and they were all just as good. Harumi only offers sushi and some appy items (tempura, edamame, etc). So if you are more of the teriyaki camp, as opposed to sushi, you won't have any choices here.   Not only is the food great, the service is also amazing. The servers were all very friendly and you get the feeling they all like working there. On the first night, my colleagues and I received a free, extra item from the kitchen. It was a courtesy item (some call it a \"service\") that's not on the menu (probably something they do for the omakaze) and it was so good! On my second night, one of the servers accidentally told me that an 8pc toro sashimi was $16. It turns out that it was really $30 and they honored the $16 price! PLUS the kitchen gave me a free, extra spicy scallop hand roll (again, probably part of their omakaze offering).   If you are craving very good sushi with great service, that is not pretentious, that is pretty casual and chill, you have to try Harumi. If I visit Phoenix again, I will definitely go back, again and again and again.",

The restaurant seems to be so popular in phoenix that we have arrived close to the end of service on a Wednesday and it was really packed. We were lucky to get a place since all tables were busy. It is not a huge restaurant, but it is very comfortable and staff is very friendly and helpful. Sashimis are absolutely spot on.   My favourite dish was shrimp tempura roll. It's a tempura shrimp with crab salad, cucumber, avocado and eel sauce. It was absolutely delicious. A portion has 6 pieces and it costs only 7 dollars. Given how delicious it is for me it is a bargain.   Another high point for me was the unfiltered sake. I have been to countless Japanese restaurants around the world, but never heard of it. Included in that selection of restaurants I have even been to a local Japanese restaurant managed by Japanese staff in London and never experienced such a delicious sake. For those who are not familiar, this type of sake looks white instead of clean as usually they look like. It is submitted to a simpler way of filtration, hence the different look. It is sweeter as opposed to the dry and stinger taste of filtered sake.",

I forgot to write a review, even after raving about it for weeks after.  I finally made my way back to downtown again and had to have some sushi.  I'm surely not the only one who turned her nose up at the thought of sushi in the desert.  Living on the coast totally spoils you for the freshest fish possible, and the idea of sushi in Phoenix honestly sort of curled my toes a bit.  But if you're that person doubting sushi in the Sonoran, really think again and give this place a try.  The lunch specials are wonderfully priced, and you will not leave disappointed (or hungry).  Service was so friendly, and the waitress was fun and delightfully sassy - loved her!    I'd come back here whenever I'm downtown.  And the next time you get that dreaded jury summons notice in the mail, before you think of how you can wiggle out of it, just think of Harumi and smile.  It will make doing your civic duty totally worthwhile!",

I was dining alone so was seated quickly at the window but all the tables were seated on the Saturday night, they were quoting about 45mins-1hour wait. They don't have a picture menu which made it a little harder to visualize the rolls but I managed ok and got their Sashimi Sampler, Spicy Tuna Rolls and their Sampler which lets you pick 3 deluxe rolls and get about 4-6 pieces of each! I also asked if they could make me a salmon skin hand roll (not on their menu) and they accommodated! The rolls were pretty good and the sashimi was fresh. Their black rice is unique and super interesting - a first for me!   The service was a bit slow, I was waiting almost 10 minutes between items and they forgot about my requested hand-roll, but the staff were very nice and I had a few different people check in on me which was great!",

They know exactly what they're doing, and because the place isn't accommodating too many people, they can artfully and carefully craft their creations.   The yellowtail was some of the best I've ever had outside of Los Angeles. The sushi is light, well portioned and proportioned. I never felt like \"This could use a little of this/that\".  Also... what is it about that purple rice? It's subtle, but I find it to be a superior vehicle for the fish to white rice. Maybe I drank the Kool-aid, but who cares?  I'm in!  I encourage you to go.

I saw online that they had a grab and go station, but when I visited, it was empty so I sat and wait for my to-go order. No big deal, it was only a short wait and I had enough change in the meter. Parking wasn't bad, but I can imagine that during prime times it could be a bit of a challenge to find a spot. Make sure to bring some change for the meter! Definitely recommend this place. The only small downfall for me was that the sushi rice was a bit sweeter than I am used to. Still good, but I do like the regular rice better. The fish was all fantastic!

Not as sweet as I have read on some reviews here but I did have someone in my party agree with that. The rice was super soft which was good enough for me. The quality of the fish which is most important to me was so surprisingly good and one of the best I have tried in Pheonix. I actually liked the fish in the rolls a lot. As for the nigiri, I'd say the quality of the fish was not quite there, with the exception of the scallops being really fresh and sweet. It can get crowded. It was a 45 min wait when we arrived so we opted for the take out instead which was pretty fast. The guy at the counter could use a little bit more emotion and be friendly though. Still a fun concept and I would definitely be back. Oh and keep in mind it is downtown, so parking can be tough.",

I will always go to Harumi if I'm looking to eat a lot of sushi! Their seaweed salad is also to die for! Very good! Miso soup is like $1.50 and very good! So I would give the pricing and sizing 5 stars. The inside is not as up to date but for being a little sushi spot in downtown phx it'll do. If you are looking for more of a hole in the wall type of spot to eat at this would be the one. In the heart of downtown and a little hard to find is what makes it a little more fun and unique. Also this is one of few sushi spots that serves the forbidden purple rice! I imagine this is what attracts the most people. The purple rice is their fun little spin on things. Over all love harumi, have been maybe ten times and am looking forward to always coming back to this unique spot! Oh also! The staff is always very very sweet. They never fail to say goodbye and thank you for coming in when you leave. And I mean each and every one of them will say goodbye! It's the sweetest!",

Luckily the wait was less than five minutes on that Saturday night or else we might have left.   I'm so glad we stayed! Once seated, the entire staff was very friendly and even seemed excited when taking our order. There were a few birthday parties going on in the restaurant that night. They made them stand up and everyone sang to them.  Normally I'm not a fan of being disturbed when trying to enjoy a meal, but the overflowing enthusiasm shown by everyone who worked there made it a fun experience.  The portion sizes of the food were bigger than I've had at any other sushi restaurant - and it was all very fresh! They use a certain kind of rice that is purple when served. It was definitely different than anything I've seen before.   They forgot to serve us our edamame, but gladly took it off our bill for us with no problem.

After seeing the high rating, my friend and I decided to walk over. We saw that it was busy but not full so we had hope.   Even though there was at least 4 open tables (5 including a reserved one), they were not seating anyone that had been waiting. The tables themselves hadn't been bussed yet. So patiently we wait, 25 minutes go by and they still aren't bussed and the line continues to grow. Being near the front, we decided to continue waiting.   35 mins hit and we are seated along the front window. The table was still dirty... Another 10 goes by and we finally order our drinks. 10 mins later they arrive and we place our order. 20 mins later and that arrives. I order their pot stickers and they were tasty. I also got some tuna nigiri which was COVERED in this spicy bitter sauce. Yuck. Lastly I got spicy tuna rolls which were poorly put together and extremely loose. My friend got the Vegas roll which also were poorly constructed and covered in a spicy mayo. They also only tasted like pure jalapeno. They went unfinished.   Also, the service was abysmal. I finished my water and never got to have it refilled in the hour and half long meal. My friend waited 25 mins to get a refill on a coke. Ugh. While busy, they didn't look short staffed or over filled. We saw them standing by the front a lot.   All in all, I will never go back.",

All the staff, including the owner of the place is super friendly! Every time I go there the owner makes sure to say hello to everybody and even comes by the table. Now, that is called amazing customer service.   Food is absolutely delicious! I usually like to start my meal with the Misho soup. They have a great twist on everything. Best edamame I've ever had. It comes seasoned which I love. I tried so many rolls and really can't pick the favorite one. However, I can recommend few...H3 roll, Sex and the city, Oh My God Roll, Oasis roll, etc.   The technique used to sear and flavor is really very nice. Also, they use purple rice !!! Anything you order of the menu, believe me, you will not regret it. And, do yourself a favor and get the fresh made real wasabi.  Atmosphere is super nice. It is such a welcoming place. Be sure if you go in a bigger group to call ahead for reservations, as they really get busy.  The only recommendation to the owner is, perhaps to play some Japanese music",

    "text": "Surprisingly impressed with this downtown sushi restaurant. Small and quaint but very cool vibe. Good date restaurant. They use black rice in their rolls (as opposed to white rice) because it is a super food that is supposedly an antioxidant. I LOVED the \"Oh My God\" roll. The service was good, but not great. Sort of the typical Asian restaurant where the server isn't excessively friendly but just gets down to business. Check this place out if you are downtown",

But they also require the most in terms of the quality of the fish. With that being said you will not disappoint if you look for quality fish here. 2. The service staff tries but can get overwhelmed. They are welcoming people tries to attend to your needs. But on weekend night when crowds get crazy they can miss a thing or two. Beside some waiting (you won't hear them call your number if you are outside so be careful about that), you might also won't receive a thing or two on your order. For example for the TWO CONSECUTIVE TIMES we were there on weekend nights, we didn't get the miso soup we ordered and still get them on the check. When we went on weekdays that never happened and miso soup almost always was the first thing to arrive. With that being said going on a weekday would be a much better bet. If you are determined to go on weekends plan your time accordingly and pay attention to the check to make sure you don't get charged on things you don't receive. 3. The owner is entertaining so you don't need to be shy about joking with him ;)",

We got some potstickers as appetizers, and ordered like 3 rolls. 1 was definitely Las Vegas, the sex and the city, and another one don't remember. They were all delicious!!!! Writing about it is making me crave it again, everything tasted fresh. We already had a lot of food on our table and the waitress brought us some sashimi on the house. Im not a big fan but I tried it and it was pretty good. I couldn't really understand what she was calling it by my nephew loved it and ate it all except the one I tried.

Not to mention the customer service is nonexistent. My fiance and I form an interracial relationship. We went to Harumi on a busy Friday night, and put down our names with the hostess. After everyone who had come before us had been seated, it was our turn. However, three white couples were seated before we were. When I approached the hostess about my grievance she called over the manager. He dismissed our complaint and returned to the kitchen without even uttering a word to us! The hostess looked awkwardly at us, and continued to seat others before us! This place is garbage, and honestly you can find better, more authentic sushi in the valley. My recommendation is to try Yama Sushi House, right up Central from this trash-heap.",

The restaurant was warmer than I would expect which worried me a bit. I believe the reviews may have been a little to generous as far as the quality goes. It is affordable and fast like you may have read before, but it just falls short in everything else. Maybe it's worth a second shot, perhaps they had an off day!!",

You got me waddling out of here with my pants undone.   They've only got sushi on the menu -- and damn do they do it right. Lightning fast service, generous slices of fresh fish (and like 12 pieces to a roll!), and the use of black rice instead of white was perfectly portioned and delectable. Yeah, I said it. Delectable.   They also had some killer toro specials we didn't try, so I'll dream about them later. Bottom line? If ever I'm back in Phoenix I will definitely be returning.",

On the morning after, I was still saying OMG to the heavenly taste sensations, including the unique smoky flavor of the OMG roll. How will any sushi compare to this? It won't.

So perhaps the good reviews are for rolls that don't include fresh (uncooked) fish; ie. tempura, crab salad...even sides such as edamame, rice, miso soup, etc.  So here is my review of the tuna and albacore sashimi: it was grayish, fishy, chewy, and coated with some sort of \"shine,\" and I still can't believe they actually served it. The freshie melts in your mouth and is never chewy . Those of you who have had this experience are already aware that grey/fishy/chewy sashimi is old! I am looking for a better quality sashimi place (nearby) if anyone has any advice...thank you in advance!",

We live in Scottsdale and didn't know what was around this area and We have had limited time between her shows - we lucked out with Harumi! The nicest most staff and amazing fish - and the best part is that the size of the nigiri and pieces of sashimi is about twice that of any other sushi restaurant in AZ! Its delicious, vefresh, and the service is so quick and soooo great! My daughter says its her absolute favorite place now! Update: Another weekend downtown for my daughters ballet recitals, had sushi 3 times in 2 days, got it all to go this time to eat and feed my daughter in the dressing room. Harumi wins again! My 4 kids all raved over the above avg size of nigiri, and that they listened and did not put wasabi on anything as we requested! This is still our fav place, will be back in 3 weeks when we have another show.  Best part is truly how kind and pleasant all staff members are! Thanks Harumi!",

    "text": "Amazing sushi at a great price with personal service from the owner - It doesn't get any better than this!    My friend and I have been trying out different sushi places all over town, and stopped in for lunch at this relatively new spot.  We were welcomed with an enthusiastic traditional Japanese shouted welcome from the sushi chefs, and three steps through the door the hostess offered us a choice of two generous rolls from which to try a free sample.  We could barely emit muffled \"Mmmmm!'s\" with our mouths crammed full of the fresh, spicy, crunchy concoctions.  We were already delighted with this place!  I tried a Bento Box lunch.  With the Bento, you choose your rice (steamed or fried), your protein (I tried the tempura shrimp - YUM!) and your salad/veggies at the counter, then pay, go fill your fountain drink and sit.  By the time our butts hit the seats they were bringing my Bento Box with five steaming tempura shrimp sitting atop my selections.  Everything was fresh, hot, crisp and authentically seasoned (not the cheap, syrupy glop you get at mall food courts.)  It was more than I could possibly eat and it was only $8.  My friend's \"tower\" also came out impossibly quickly after we sat down, especially considering it looked like a work of art!  The good natured chef who prepared and served it turned out to be the owner, and WOW, what a nice guy!  He gave us the VIP treatment, joking around warmly with us, explaining that the tower was meant to be mixed before consuming it, (which seemed a real shame, given the obvious care and artistry that went into the presentation!) and whipping out two spoons he deconstructed it with flourish.  When my friend took the first bite, I thought she was going to break into a rendition of the famous \"When Harry Met Sally\" orgasm scene!  She insisted I try a bite and it was indeed fabulous.    We were already over the moon, but the owner wasn't finished with us yet.  He insisted we sample one more of his creations - on the house!  He gave us a choice of salmon or tuna.  Out came two identical, absolutely gorgeous salmon-topped balls of purple rice, decorated with perfect slivers of chive and of course, wasabi and ginger.  When we tried these, we were floored.  Best salmon sashimi I have ever tasted in my 48 years of being a Japanese-American!  Melted in the mouth, seriously.  That fish was so tender, it is amazing it didn't just fall apart while swimming in the ocean!  But wait, there's more!  Despite the fact that such quality for such reasonable prices is already a great deal, from 2pm - 5pm everything goes on sale for half price!  WHAT?!?  No way!  I think I have to go get a downtown job so I can eat a late lunch daily at these bargain prices...and then I'll take home some more for dinner from the large variety of \"to go\" sushi in the take out case...and then I'll come back on October 7th when they extend their hours to start serving dinner!",

Nothing was cheaply made, obvious that the chef Juno puts care and seriousness into the food.

After that...we just kept ordering Nigiri & Sashimi until we needed a wheel barrel!  Also, very reasonable prices.  We had a blast, will def go back!",

    "text": "FINALLY...an amazing sushi restaurant! This is the best sushi I've had in the Phoenix metro area. I was recently in Hawaii and the fish was as fresh as in Hawaii...seriously! I work downtown a couple of days a week and used to dread the commute. Now I have something to look forward to. I actually want to go to work downtown just so I can go to Harumi for lunch and get take-out for dinner.  Pros:  1. Extremely fresh fish (and not just for the desert) 2. Great prices ((e.g. Lunch: $10 for 6 nigiri and 4 pieces of spicy tuna roll; same thing for $7 after 2 pm)  3. VERY friendly, proud, and helpful staff and owners 4. They have fresh wasabi (worth the extra $2) 5. Purple rice (different in an excellent way; sweet, sticky, and complements the sushi perfectly)  Cons:  1. Sushi lunch special (e.g. $10 for 6 nigiri and 4 pieces of spicy tuna roll) is limited to what is in the refrigerated case. If you get there later in the day (obviously) the selection is more limited. 2. Even though the fresh wasabi is $2 extra and really worth it, it would be even better to get it for free.  Wonderful sushi restaurant. Already planning my return.",

Juno was quick about getting us a table. We first ordered a large beer and a large hot sake which was shared between 3 of us. EVERYTHING we ordered was delish!! We ordered the OMG roll (YOU MUST HAVE) and a couple other dishes. We had one that the sushi was rolled in cucumber which was one of my other favorites. Chef Juno gave us ice cream mochi which was to die for. Great atmosphere!",

    "text": "Hands down the best sushi in Phoenix. Yes, I know I've said that about other establishments before... but that was before Harumi.   After a second visit last night we were blown away by how wonderful this place is. Last night we again got the 5 nigiri, 6 sashimi, and we asked if we could substitute the oasis roll in favor of the crazy roll, which they did without hesitation. The crazy roll is crazy good and the fish is the perfect combination tucked into the yummy and unique purple rice. The rolls are just bite site, not those giant ones that make you look like a chipmunk trying not to choke. We also started with the jalapeno poppers, which were light, fresh, not overpowered with cream cheese, and just the right amount of spicy. Will definitely order these again. The last visit we had the crispy stuffed shrimp to start which were amazing- so I think I just have to order both and have leftovers.   Now the fish... the fish is ridiculously fresh and the highest quality. The lines of fat in the salmon and the melt in your mouth as your eyes roll back in your head... yes, I get that I am talking about food. But this is an experience in joy. I wanted to bow a thousand times over to the chef on the way out. Thank you, thank you for coming to Phoenix!",

They used this black or purple rice which is really unique and gives a sweetness to the overall taste of the roll.  The employees were all really friendly and nice do I would definitely recommend this spot if you are in the area.",

    "text": "We are 4 guys that frequently eat out. If anyone in the group will find SOMETHING wrong with the food, it's going to be me. Honestly, I can't say enough good about this place! First, we love to eat local. It appears to be owned by a Japanese couple, and they are sure to remain present and visible. They're very friendly. One of the friends has been here before during the day, and they remembered him and commented that he'd never been there for dinner. Impressive. The wife came over and looked at what we ordered, told us that 1. we were ordering the wrong rolls (she was right) and 2. we were ordering too much (she was right again). The chef (husband) came out from behind the counter and spoke with us, truly showed his appreciation and gratitude for us coming in. They sent out a few pieces of seared salmon that they were trailing that wasn't yet on the menu, and it was delicious (although I prefer my sushi raw). The wait staff was friendly and attentive. The prices, I felt, were very fair, especially because they use purple rice, which is healthier and more expensive in general (and DELICIOUS). The atmosphere is what you'd expect from a local family-owned restaurant - not a huge dining room, nothing extravagant or over-the-top, but friendly and quaint. We had a nice brief conversation with the group next to us.  We didn't at first order the Oh My God roll, but man am I glad the owner suggested it! It's incredible. They light it on fire when they bring it out. And I understand how it got its name. Oh my God...really delicious. I had suggested it to the group next to us, and I heard the one gal say, \"Oh my God\" when she tried it. We also got the blue fin combo, the Philly salmon roll, the crunch roll, the caterpillar roll and I don't even remember what else. It really was all so good. It's been a while since I've had a meal that fulfilling. We planned on having leftovers, but we ended up eating everything (and we probably ordered enough for 6 or 7 people). I'm glad the owner dissuaded us from ordering more.  We will be back.",

A day earlier I had eaten at Squid Ink, which I thought was good and I especially liked the set-up and atmosphere there.  You don't find this ambiance at Harumi Sushi; however, in my opinion the sushi at Harumi Sushi is more memorable.  Harumi Sushi uses black rice.  I asked about this and was told that they use it because it is healthier, even though it is more expensive.  I loved the rice.  I ordered yellowtail, eel, squid, and octopus.  It was all very good and fresh.  The eel was one of the best I have ever tasted.  At many places I feel the sauce served on eel is too sweet; that was not the case here.    I'm back in the Los Angeles area now, and there are many good sushi places here.  I particularly like Sugar Fish.  However, Harumi Sushi was special and I hope that I get to return to Phoenix so that I can eat there again.  If you are in the Phoenix area and like sushi, I highly recommend that you give Harumi Sushi a try.",

    "text": "So some friends of mine had found this place and since it was in DT Phoenix I was happy to make a food discovery outside of my comfortable Scottsdale zone.  The girlfriend is a big sushi fan so definitely couldn't pass this opportunity up.  The staff was very friendly and we were able to get a table there no problem even for a Friday night, but it looked like they had some tables reserved so that explains some things.    First off we had the shrimp tempura and watch out it's piping hot, but only because it's so fresh!  The first words out of my mouth were, THIS IS THE BEST TEMPURA SHRIMP I\"VE EVER HAD.  I mean i'm no stranger when it comes to tempura shrimp and this appetizer was just so flavorful and crispy and fresh.  To top it off the ponzu sauce had an added kick of spice in it which put it over the top.  The rolls that we got were the H3 roll and the Oh my God roll as well as a spicy salmon roll.  Now right off the bat you know it's different b/c they used some sort of purple rice it seemed like.  I know i've seen this type of rice before, but could not specify the type of rice.  The H3 roll was good and I am unable to go into too much detail due to it being overshadowed by the Oh My God Roll.  So the Oh My God roll is nothing I've ever seen before.  It comes wrapped up in (for what I can see a child crafting a viking helmet out of foil) and there's a plate that's ON FIRE!!!!  Then this viking helmet starts flying!!   OH my GOD! as in... Oh My God it's flying!! or... Oh My GOD there's a Fire...or just OH MY GOD It was sooo darn good!!!!  Our waiter unwraps this foil contraption and there's this awesome roll that has almost a smoky campfire type flavor to it which was just fantastic!  I can't even tell you what was in it, just eat it!!  I will definitely be going back.  Cheers!!",

I live in Tucson so this will be my new Phoenix noms for sure! It's so good! This place is super casual, the rice is purple,  and good luck finding that bathroom, it's like the dang labyrinth back there. My tip to you is ask for your spicy tuna extra spicy and don't forget to ask for the real wasabi, you won't be let down! Oh and they close from 2-5 but after 5 the parking is free on the road!

    "text": "The plainness of the restaurant is in stark contrast to the exquisitely tasty, beautiful, and fresh fish. I had omekase (chef's choice), which included an Oasis roll (cucumber, rather than rice, wrapped it), tuna, salmon, yellowtail, a mixed roll (with purple/black rice (nutty tasting)... The plate was artfully presented and included wasabi shaped like a jalapeno with a real jalapeno stem. Many of the fish were topped with fresh wasabi. The salmon was melt-in-the mouth wonderful.  Sometimes the rolls were too big to pop in the mouth without (as one writer posted) looking like a chipmunk. I wonder if the chef might consider this - especially for the Oasis roll (delightfully refreshing, but very big).  Parsley, shredded daikon, and lettuces were used as garnishes on the plate. It was nice to have the freshness of the parsley as a contrast to the fish. I also wondered about shiso leaves. --I have yet to see shiso leaves in Arizona. Maybe this place has them. I will have to return to find out.   I asked for ginger ice cream, and was initially told they had it. A server came and explained they did not, and offered green tea, plum, or vanilla. We selected green tea and plum. Both were overly sweet and lacked flavor. The ice cream was very creamy (not used to Japanese ice cream being so creamy) and had nice texture, but the flavor just wasn't there. Our server kindly took it back. Usually, I am a big fan of green tea, ginger, and red bean ice cream.  A companion did not recommend the bathroom. It is apparently shared by the building tenants. I told the server about this and she kindly said it would be addressed.",

The location is perfect, right at 1st Ave and Adams in downtown. We went for dinner around 5, and they were not too busy. The menu is very straight forward. A few appetizers, some basic rolls, some special rolls and some entreees. We opted for the sushi and holy cow were we impressed. We opted for this three \"mini\" roll plate tha t you get to choose from a list of maybe 7 rolls. it came with 6 piece of each, a TON of sushi ($15). We also did the Ahi Stack ($13), which was fantastic. It was the sushi rice, covered in super fresh spicy tuna, covered with some eel sauce and some spicy mayo, and some tempura flakes. Holy hell, this was FANTASTIC!!! We also opted for a basic California roll ($4) for my daughter, and some gyoza ($4.50). all in all , super fresh fish, perfect service and just awesome sushi. They use \"black rice\" which turns purple when turned into sushi rice. It didn't alter the flavor at all, but the texture a bit in the best way. All I can says is wow, wow, wow. What a great spot. I'm going back ASAP!",

This place had great reviews on Yelp and was very close to our hotel downtown so we gave it a try. The restaurant was crowded when we arrived so we had a quick wait of about 5 minutes until we were seated. Until looking at the menu, we were unaware that the restaurant was strictly a sushi bar. We were interested in also having some fried rice and hibachi but I guess this was our fault for doing thorough enough research. (They do serve bento boxes with cooked dishes for lunch). We ordered the shrimp tempura app and the seaweed salad. Both of which were really good. I then ordered the ahi tower which blew my mind. The purple rice was a unique touch. I loved how the ingredients weren't packed into the typical sushi roll and instead were piled on top of each other in a bowl. It allowed us to take the perfect bite every time. The presentation was great and the tuna was probably the best quality that I ever ate. Our server was super friendly and didn't mind any of our special requests. Overall, I give Harumi Sushi 2 thumbs up and would definitely recommend this spot to a fellow sushi lover.",

The dining area itself is small, but they are quick to get you in and out. There are not too many larger booths, which makes it difficult to accommodate a larger crowd.   It is like an expedition to get to the restroom. You must pass through several doorways and hallways at which point you are pretty much lost somewhere in the back of the restaurant.

They keep telling us we are next on the list, but they continue to give away tables to others and claiming those tables are inappropriate for my toddler. I was really hoping that their food would be the saving grace of the evening, but I was disappointed there too. Here is a list of all we ordered. -Crunch mango roll - hot mess of different ingredients forced together in overly sweet eel sauce and no mango flavor = avoid -H3 roll - the 3 spicy fish complemented each other well along with masago = order -Oh My God - cooked hot mess in that overly sweet eel sauce again = avoid at all cost -Mini Roll Combo - Rainbow, Crazy rolls were average but edible. Spider was unrecognizable?! The soft shell crab was hidden inside this huge gob of imitation crab salad. No soft shell crab was visible from outside. I had to ask the waiter what it was. Overall, we were very disappointed in the food and service from one individual. I came here due to the high rating and number of reviews. I should of turned around when I did not see one Asian customer in the entire restaurant. If you want good Japanese sushi, then avoid this place. If you want unrecognizable American rolls, where you can barely taste the fish, then come here.",

We stayed for a rainbow roll and I loved it so much the purple rice is so pretty I felt so good after eating it. The second time was right when it opened at 11am on  Tuesday which was nice. I tried real Wasabi which is OMG amazing! I had no idea it would be so good ! The seaweed salad was also perfect. This place is definately my favorite spot to get sushi.",

When we walked in there was already a line of people all the way to the door, waiting for a table. The staff was so busy we weren't really acknowledged, and we didn't know if we just wait in line or if we needed to put a name down. We waited about 15min until  it was our turn to get sat. Service started off slow, but it was understandable as the place was packed. Our waitress and the rest of the staff were super nice and did everything with a smile. Ok now, let's get down to business and talk food! The sushi was amazing. I'm already craving the HA Roll again. That was by far my favorite roll that we tried. It was the perfect combination of sweet spicy and the cucumber crunch to it added a refreshing touch. Other favorites were OMG Roll and Spicy Scallops. All the rolls were served with purple rice opposed to white which was kind of cool and different. We also tried the Stuff Jalapenos which were surprisingly not spicy, but still great!",

Next I had the tuna stuffed, Japanese style jalapeno poppers presented with eel sauce. Delicious and unique. For an entree, the sashimi and crazy roll combo (a tuna, salmon, crab roll with cucumber wrap in place of nori) was, once again, one of a kind.  The people behind me had the omakase and it looked spectacular.  I was skeptical - sushi so far inland. But the reviews are accurate. Don't miss out.",

    "text": "I was FINALLY able to get to Harumi, after it being on my list for months, thanks to my lady friend who decided to take me there for dinner before going to see Avenue Q at the Phoenix Theatre. I'm so glad she did! There is a distinct lack of really good sushi in Phoenix. Much of it is overrated and overpriced, or it's some chain restaurant. Harumi is neither.  We got the sushi sampler plate, that came with slightly smaller versions of three different rolls, the spicy tuna roll, and some yellowtail sashimi. For the sampler, we opted for the Crazy Roll, the Rainbow Roll, and the Vegas Roll. All three were excellent, but I think my favourite was the Crazy Roll. It had salmon, tuna, and avocado, was wrapped in soy paper instead of seaweed, and was topped with masago. I'm almost mad that I had to share it. The Vegas Roll was good, but fairly typical, as was the Rainbow Roll. The Spicy Tuna had enough kick to actually make it interesting. The sashimi was fresh and flavourfull.   My only issue was that the rolls weren't sticking very well. They kept falling apart. It didn't affect the taste, obviously, but dealing with rolls that won't stay together can be a pain. I love the use of the purple rice! It added a little something extra that you don't usually see at other sushi places.   The place is small, so make sure you time your visit right. As it's smack in the middle of downtown, it gets slammed at lunch during the week, as I understand. Dinner time on a Saturday wasn't too bad at all. No long lines, no long wait time. Our rolls were delivered pretty quick after we ordered them.   Note: if you are not a fan of the owners of restaurants talking to you during your meal, be forewarned... the owners are very chatty! But they didn't really disrupt our date, which was good.   I'm going to say that Harumi is definitely a) on my list to go back, soon, and b) the best sushi I've had in Phoenix.",

A week has passed and no refund on my cc. Called tonight about the refund, same girl made a lame excuse about nobody there to process the refund and hung up on me. I was furious about this behavior and called back to speak to the manger and she hung up on me again!  I wasn't rude or shouting but this kind of customer service is unbelievable!

It's the healthiest rice out there. Despite the small spaces interior, this place is always busy because their food is amazing!!!! My favorite is the Omg roll and the H3 roll!! Yum!! Actually all their rolls are absolute heaven!! And at the end, the owner came by and dropped off peach mango mochi ice cream for us. Thank you!!",

I got there a bit earlier than the time they open on a tuesday, and there were two other people walking up to the restaurant; they let us in and kindly sat us without any issue. They are right on Central, so you can access it from the rail system without driving into downtown; there are two convenient stops so the walk is not far from the rail.  I ordered a miso soup and the sushi combo with nigiri and a crazy roll. The soup was excellent and full of vegetables.  The fish was exceptional, and the wasabi sauce they have is so good. I have never had a wasabi sauce like they offer. The nigiri was a good sized cut atop the rice, and the roll was stuffed full, and very flavorful without any condiments.  The ginger was really good and maybe the best ginger offered at any sushi restaurant I've eaten at.",

No sure why they ruined the salmon by putting some bitter green whatever it was on top which I had never seen before in my life (and I get a LOT of sushi). Otherwise the fish itself was fine. Edamame came out too hot and some edamame pieces were over steamed. Seaweed salad was standard. Can't speak for the sushi rolls since I didn't order any but it seems to be a popular place with lots of foot traffic.",

Unlike many sushi places it wasn't closed between lunch and dinner so that was nice.   The atmosphere let's just say is functional given a fairly long and narrow space, but makes for a nice long sushi bar and some booths to the side. There's a seating across the front for people watching while you eat which is what I did. The bathroom situation is a bit funky having to go out the back and through some corridors and what not, but they were clean.   Now onto the important part, the fare:   I had the chef's choice sashimi plate for $12, which was awesome, fresh, and fairly filling with decent size cuts.   I also ordered a Philadelphia roll add jalapeno for $6+$1 and it again was tasty. Now it had some purple rice and I forgot to ask what that was about. I'm sure it's healthier than white rice for whatever reason, but more importantly it was yummy.   Would definitely go back if I'm in downtown Phoenix.",

    "text": "I had my doubts about good sushi in Phoenix, considering that the ocean is far from visible. But after reading the numerous positive reviews about this place, I decided to bring my colleague to check it out. We walked over on a Monday night, and were seated right away. Service was already excellent--the hostess and the server were both smiley and friendly, and gave us the appropriate amount of time to decide what we wanted.  Food selections: 1. Gyoza (4/5, $5): By all means, standard. No other way to describe it. 2. Veggie tempura (3/5, $4): I think the menu says 5 pieces, but upon first glance, it's a pretty big plate of tempura. Also standard. I thought the yam and squash (?) pieces were a bit undercooked, though. 3. Spicy tuna roll (4/5, $6): Pretty good. Nice proportion of rice to fish, and it's pleasantly spicy, and quite fresh. 4. Spicy salmon roll (3.5/5, $6): Just okay. Not as fresh as the tuna that time. I'd probably go for the spicy tuna because that's usually something you can't go wrong with (unless you don't eat raw fish). Spicy salmon just sounded exotic to me. 5. H3 roll (5/5, $13): This is also an exotic-sounding roll, consisting of spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy yellowtail, and other fillings. While the fish in this are all described as spicy, I would not call the roll spicy. It simply has a slight kick to it. Definitely flavorful, as well as recommended.  All this came out to just under $37. Pretty darn good! Oh, about that purple rice... I'm no rice and grains expert, but I don't think it tastes that different from brown rice, and the texture is drastically different from white rice. But I do think it filled me more easily, which is nice, because it made for a cheaper dinner :p",

Speaking of, I ordered spicy salmon roll and spicy tuna roll. In both rolls, the fish were mashed up. Why!? Please leave it in one piece, literally, so we can actually  have the experience of eating. When it's all mashed up, the texture is like food that's been chewed up and spat out. That should be the golden rule for any sushi restaurant. 'Don't convert fish into mashed potatoes!' Lastly, I got the seaweed salad. Mediocre.  Verdict: wouldn't be dying to go back but if I have to, I would try something else.",

My food took a while and it was not what i expected. The miso soup had an interesting after taste and the location uses purple rice to make sushi. This was my first time trying and I was not impressed. The highlight of the night was watching the sushi chef/floor manager yell at a waitress in front of GUEST . She was  handling  some  aluminum foil that was on fire. I believe this is a dish, I am not sure if SHE was doing the procedure wrong but he was just yelling at her. REGARDLESS  that should not be Something  the guest have to see.Besides not having good food they have to Invest  in some customer service Courses.",

Even more amazing is the fact that the Sushi is well priced and served from a restaurant that is a bit of a hole in the wall. Most sushi places you will find are large and planned, but Harumi has the charm of being hidden away amongst the big buildings. For the homesick, you can almost imagine you are in LA, SF or NYC.   While the quality of the food is top notch, the other most important factor is the presence of the owner. Most nights he is there checking on everyone and making you feel special by offering extra treats. If you are in town visiting or miss home, come to Harumi - I do and I am always happy with the choice.",

For instance, the miso soup has been sitting prepared too long, so the onions were soggy (they should be added just before serving) and the gyoza is another unfortunate Phoenix creation: deep fried. Ugh. If you want really good homemade gyoza that's also cooked properly (slightly pan fried on one side and left to steam on the other)--head next door to the Noodle Bar... 1 of like 2 restaurants in the whole valley that makes it right.

On the way out the door she had the audacity to thank us for coming and welcome us back next time. Will never go back. This place was the worst customer service I've seen.

    "text": "As the awareness of supporting local businesses continues to  grow, Harumi Sushi is one place which will have you thinking twice about ever going to a chain sushi restaurant ever again. Centrally located in downtown Phoenix, it's a leisurely 3 minute stroll from the light rail. Owned and operated by Juno, this hidden gem in the desert offers some of the finest sushi in a comfortable, home-like setting.   Originally from New York, Juno can be seen actively engaging his customers offering advice and suggestions to insure a great dining experience. His heart warming smile is shared by his staff who seem to be genuinely happy to welcome you into their establishment.   We were a table of three and were instantly greeted by the hostess and seated promptly. It was 8pm and we decided to order edamame for starters. Reading the menu, the OMG roll caught my eye. My friends suggested we give permission for the chef to choose three additional rolls. Risky? Absolutely, but what an adventure!  Juno created three additional rolls which words can not possibly describe the medley of flavors and artful presentation. Each piece was a well choreographed dance of flavors ranging from the simple to complex. The fresh pickled ginger cleansed and prepared the palette for the ensuing journey. It wasn't until the end that I realized I hadn't even touched my traditional soy sauce with wasabi mixture. It seemed irreverent and unnecessary like steak sauce to a filet mignon. A notable feature of the sushi is no white rice, black rice which turns purple when cooked offers a unique flavor and serves as the perfect foundation allowing the novice to easily lift the sushi with precision.   September 7th will be the one year anniversary of Harumi Sushi. Juno's dream is to open a 3,500sf restaurant offering the finest sushi accompanied by a piano and Japanese drums. Won't you please join me in helping this dream become a reality. Let's come together as a community and support Juno and his dream. I assure you, you will not be disappointed.",

I have only been for lunch and it's always a madhouse so the service is kind of all over the place but it's completely worth it. I definitely recommend asking for real wasabi instead of the paste. They have it by request and man, it is so good. Their lunch specials are more than reasonable and their rolls are pretty big. I always go hungry and always leave with food in hand due to my eyes being bigger than my belly. There are sushi spots all over the valley, do yourself a favor if you want outstanding fish and go here. It's not romantic or charming but the food is top notch. I normally get a lunch platter which will give you a little of everything (sashimi, rolls, etc) then an order of jalapeno poppers. The poppers are insane. They half a whole jalapeno, stuff it with crab mix then tempura batter it and do a quick flash fry. I'm getting hungry thinking about them. Anyway, I highly recommend this spot. Parking stinks as it's downtown but it is still worth it.",

Their rainbow roll is just tuna and salmon, which is pretty good though not quite a rainbow.   The purple rice is pretty unique, and definitely try the real wasabi.  It's a bit small and has been getting more and more popular, so there can be a bit of a wait during busy times. Good service and the nice people, even when they're packed.",

The staff is friendly and the food comes out very quickly once it's ordered. I recommend the dumplings and shrimp tempura rolls, they are fantastic. The only downside I have is that the place is a bit small, so it feels at times that you have to rush and eat. More like they want you to eat and leave immediately. Other then that, this place is awesome and definitely worth trying out!",

Surprisingly it was only $35 so I was a little skeptical as you can imagine.  At most legit sushi places this can be well into the triple digits.  This is not one of those types of places unfortunately but still a good money's worth.    The sushi is served with purple rice.  I find that interesting since it is supposedly healthier than regular white sushi rice.  It tasted just as good.  The portions of fish were pretty substantial. The omakase even came with Toro.  But I wonder whether this was real because it was such a big piece.  We also order a spicy tuna roll which turned out to be pretty good.  The squid on the dish was a bit chewy and I did not care for it.  But everything else was delightful.  For phoenix, it was a good experience being that there is really no water nearby for fresh sushi.",

By far some of the best eel I've had, but there's not much in the way of more traditional rolls, so it's a lot of sauce and deep frying. We were unable to be seated until our whole group was present, which was frustrating since it was slow and there's no waiting area, but the catering place next door was making cake pops so I was entertained.  By far the best part was the Oh My God roll. It's wrapped in tinfoil and lit on fire giving it a Smokey and wholly unique flavor which was honestly incredible. However, we didn't know it was going to be lit on fire so when they did the whole table kind of freaked out a little and when my friend asked the waitress what was going on she just said \"oh my god\" which of course we responded \"yeah, that's what we said. Oh my god, why is it on fire!?!?\" It took us a while to realize she meant Oh My God Roll! We got a good laugh out of that. It's a small place and worth going for the omg roll. But be prepared, they light it on fire!",

It's a little odd to see a sushi restaurant with no actual sushi bar imo, and there are plenty of items that are just missing from the menu that are fairly standard in sushi restaurants (uni, hand rolls, etc). It's a Korean owned joint which is no big deal as the majority of places these days are as such and the staff there are jamming it up and having a good time. Some people commented on the purple rice and that didn't really bother me. Typically any rolls you order are just filler as it's too easy to hide the quality of fish and the rice is packed to fill you up...the rice being purple to that point is irrelevant and it tastes like white rice. It's an all right place, but not sure I'd come back unless forced to by my co-worker again.",

Having just moved to Central Phx from Scottsdale, I immediately recognized the menu as being the same as Kodo, which I've eaten at multiple times.  Weird, funky space, but we liked it. Service was quick, but brusque. We noted the server would only speak to me and would not acknowledge my wife. It was over 100 outside and pretty toasty inside. Sadly that high ambient temperature affected the fish, too.  For us, sushi is ultimately all about the quality of the fish. You can have all the wacky rolls and ingredients you wish. But if it's crap fish, it's crap sushi. Harumi isn't crap, but it's not great. I was really put off by the temperature and texture of some of the nigiri. No one got sick, of course, but I left food on the plate, which I've never done at a sushi restaurant.  Honestly, Hiro in N. Scottsdale is still the best sushi in the Valley. I'll wait a couple days for a reservation and drive half an hour for the freshest fish you'll find. As for Harumi, I can't imagine we'll return.",

I love the black rice which is known for it's super antioxidant properties. For anyone that concerns please note the color will throw you off more than the taste, it tastes just like white or brown rice. I noticed they work very much as a team and help each other out which was wonderful because we did not have dirty plates sitting on our table for long (huge pet peeve of mine) and something I notice since for many years I worked in the restaurant industry.

They are not trying to be Shinbay, they are trying to be your local neighborhood sushi bar and in this case that is a good thing.  Solid sake selection at reasonable prices, and the normal Japanese beers.   The Mrs enjoyed the rolls a lot, and to me the Nigiri plate was very fresh.

I'm not as familiar with sushi as other foods, but I will have to say the food was excellent and my friend liked it too.  Our server, Bill, was very helpful in making recommendations, was very friendly and he offered quick service.  I definitely will be back again as it probably was probably the best sushi I've had.",

    "text": "As sushi goes the food was good.  Not great, not bad.  The prices were fair.  I think I would have liked the food better if I was able to get what I wanted.  Most sushi restaurants will modify an order to accommodate food restrictions.  I can usually ask for a roll to be wrapped in cucumber and without rice and most places are happy to accommodate.   Even if they charge you a little extra,  they still accommodate.  They had one roll on the menu that came in a cucumber wrap and that's what you had to get if you wanted no rice.  I also asked for no crab but they still put crab in it.    My boyfriend did not enjoy the purple rice. He said it seemed a little bitter.   Bottom line,  it's fine if you don't have any food restrictions or want to modify anything.  Since I regularly enjoy the flavors in a roll minus the rice and they can only make one roll like that,  there's not enough variety to bring me back.",

His quips and antics made the meal even more enjoyable.   The reason you go to Harumi Sushi is for the quality of the food, the variety of dishes, and the great taste. You will not be disappointed at all.  We were lucky to have made a reservation as the place was packed. It is always a good idea to make reservations for dinner anywhere in the Phoenix metropolitan area on a Friday or Saturday night.  You can definitely eat sushi cheaper elsewhere, but you will probably not enjoy the dining experience as much.   This is definitely a restaurant that I will return to for more great sushi.",

They offer the real authentic wasabbi chopped in tiny piece rather than the fake wasabbi paste that most sushi places offer. I  the idea of the burning sushi roll.

I told my server no cucumbers, advocado or eel sauce and somehow I still got advocados on my rolls. It ended up being okay cause they remade it without the advocados for me and let my girl have the previous plate with the advocados for free. It tasted good! I enjoyed it. The server was nice and explained everything in my roll to me in depth since I had questions due to my vegeterian diet. I really like this place and will be coming back in the future when we go to an event at talking stick arena or go ice skating again. Laid back vibe and great service! Hard to find a spot that makes sweet potato rolls in Arizona. I have called numerous places and they all said no. We just walked in here one day and I was surprised when they said they could make it and it was on the menu. I did have to alter the menu version but it's okay at least they have it. 8 pieces for $9. Our new sushi spot! I'll try the sake next time.",

The space isn't much to look at, but the staff is friendly and efficient, the sushi is decent, and the prices reasonable. Beer and wine only.  - Greeted with two pieces of complimentary seared tuna salmon sushi while we read through the menu. I don't usually go for cooked sushi, but it was a nice gesture and actually quite good.  The rolls are large with fresh fish and pretty purple rice. If not the best I've ever had, it could be because we chose poorly. - Harumi roll- love the crunch of tempura shrimp, stuffed with a lot of krab salad which was just ok. - H3 roll- this was my fave- spicy tuna and salmon, avocado, cuke, topped w/ eel sauce and spicy mayo - OMG roll- the server brings this foil wrapped package to the table and waves it over a flame a few minutes before opening. I like eel sauce, but this one was just too sweet for my taste. - Sashimi salad- good amount of tuna and salmon tossed with cucumber, avocado, and a bit of lettuce. Next time I would ask them to go light on the eel sauce. - Real wasabi- this was new to me, bright green and a bit slimy looking, it tasted pretty good.  Overall, not a destination, but not a bad option if you're in the area and looking for affordable sushi.",

I think it was some tuna that was SO mouthwatering and just melted in my mouth. OOH I also think it's so cool they use purple rice here! Got a taste of that in the H3 roll & the OMG roll. H3 was good, but the OMG roll was...OMG. If you love novelty rolls and exciting food - TRY THIS OMG ROLL!

They do a good job of not only advertising the black rice which is the Restaurants \"concept\" ingredient; but also of having information on the screens inside about some of its many benefits.   As far as the sushi goes I ordered the Rainbow roll, Las Vegas roll(highlight), caterpillar roll, philly roll, Phoenix roll, and Gyoza.... everything was great.  I should add that I tend to order the same type of rolls everywhere I go and by comparison this was one of he best sushi spots I have tried. The fact that they use the black rice instead made a bit of an impact in that I thought the flavors on the philly roll were slightly over powering(still good tho) compared to a philly roll with standard white rice.    All and all I love concepts and this black rice with sushi concept was dead on. Can't wait to try this place again...service was great however their was a man who I'm guessing was the owner???...and he seemed to be very much so micro managing his staff. Yelling at them to do this or that from across the room. To the point that as a customer you noticed. Not okay bro!!!!! Other wise a nice small store front in down town Phoenix. Good food. Good Japanese beer. Great staff....except for that dude!!!!  Recommended.",

I gave it one more try as I haven't been there for about a year, but same old thing but worse.  Too bad, great location and potential, but it is a place you really want to pass up.  The restaurant actually smells and the floors are so dirty as well as the bathrooms along unfortunately with behind the sushi bar.  The staff will sit in the back and eat while customers are trying to get their checks or even to order.  I think it just stays semi-busy due to the location.",

We were a group of 7 this time and shared a number of different rolls. The California roll is nice but the favourite is always the Oh My God roll, which comes out on fire. There is sooo much goodness in their menu and lots of great choices. Honestly you can't go wrong.",

The fish is relatively fresh compared to other sushi places you go to. I like Sushi Ken and Hana in the Phoenix area and I would say this place is comparable. The restaurant seating is limited so make sure you very there a little early if you don't want to wait. Service was nice. We ordered the rainbow roll (my personal favorite) with the purple rice and the omakase (see pictures). The purple rice doesn't taste any different, but since purple is my favorite color, it made my food my interesting to eat, lol! I also felt the prices were reasonable for quality of the fish we got. There a huge selection of rolls. I didn't really spend the time looking through all of the options but considering that I would go back, I can always look at the menu in more detail next time!",

I ordered up the chef's special for lunch and got the omakase for dinner!    Popular place for dinner.  I had to wait for a good twenty to half hour, but it's worth it!  Casual attire for this surrounding, but above the notch sushi!  I like the squid nigiri, toro and hotate nigiri!  I had to ask if there was uni and they have it....off menu! Nice.  It doesn't hurt to ask.  The owner was friendly and entertaining as well as accommodating!  He took care of us with complimentary miso soup and this tuna sashimi flavored sauce dish!  He also packed me up some green edamame to go!  He was generous and funny with his visits during our dining experience!   Ayce sushi and staff!  Recommend, yes!",

It was just over $13. As a side note, they didn't package the soup for to go and I was only able to enjoy about a third of it. However, what I did eat was good. The rolls are made with purple rice which didn't seem to make a difference in the flavor. The salmon rolls had cream cheese and avocado and the tuna cucumber, and avocado. Very good quality fresh sushi in the heart of downtown Phoenix. I will be back!",

I came in to a semi packed place saw my lady sat down and she explained..I was greeted by staff asked for drink..I asked my lady what the specials where and she said she didn't know wasn't told, I asked her the name of the roll she ordered a Phoenix which on paper looks great what we got was not...I live sushi and for a guy in Phoenix that is rare and even I thought it was bad when I ate it like they touched it to long or something..my lady was very uncomfortable so I asked for the tab and we left...will not be going back",

This was a complete disaster from start to finish.  Server was very pushy trying to get me to order the chef special where the chef selects everything. Every question I asked was followed with the question.  Lacked knowledge in fish they serve, not a good sign.  Uses some gimmicky rice, not sure what is going on there but black rice is just not a good look, and not the standard sushi rice, another bad sign  The food: gyoza was okay, not great. It was just dropped in a fryer. Meh  Spider roll: not fresh soft-shell crap, also very skimpy on the amount. Most of the roll was crab mix... not even an ingredient in it typically.  May be good for Phoenix natives, not for anyone that has ventured out of the valley and experienced quality sushi. Big let down because the reviews had this on my watch list for a while.",

They have a sheet of paper that you mark your order on. I was debating about a few options (mainly trying a few things & going over my per diem, or sticking with 1 roll & staying under). I found the mini roll combo on the back which gave you the option to try 3 different items. I thought that was a good compromise & went with that. I ordered the Arizona, shrimp tempura & super crunch shrimp. It came out pretty promptly & looked amazzzzzing. The purple rice is so unique/pretty. Everything tastes fantastic. The only drawback food wise was the super crunch was very greasy since it was fried. I love the crunch of fried stuff but I was nervous it was so greasy I'd be sick the rest of day, so I didn't finish it.  I struggled with giving this 4 stars because the food is definitely worthy of 4 stars & I love the mini roll option which I'd never seen before, but a great way to try a few things; however the service at the end of the meal was awful. I think it took me almost 15-20 minutes to cash out. I waited at the bar for someone to pick up my payment & when no one came tried to get in line to pay at register but still waited another 5 minutes before I was helped m (& no one was in front of me). She then rang up the wrong receipt which she didn't bother to fix bc the total price was the same... anyway- stop in for a great sushi meal, as long as you aren't in a hurry to leave!",

When we arrived we noticed there was a bit of a line so it's a good precaution to ask for a reservation for a party of 3+. As we were seated, we were pleasantly seated by one of the waiters near the sushi bar. The restaurant can be a bit cramped so don't expect to have too much room when you have a party of 5. After being seated and being handed a menu, we decided on 6 plates: the OMG roll, omakase, oasis combo, and a few other rolls I honestly can't recall.  Being in Arizona, I've lowered my standards for sushi. However, I feel like even if I didn't lower my standards, Harumi Sushi would have knocked it out of the ballpark either way. Harumi sushi's quality in fish, portion size, and even price is on point. For five people, 6 plates, 2 beers, and a premium sake ($35) we were all full and our check came out to be ~$150 minus tip.   Parking can be found on the street everywhere with a meter.   Service is perfect. Very friendly and prompt. Chef Juno is the best! Always making sure everyone is happy!  TL;DR: Harumi Sushi is my new standard for sushi. Best. Sushi. Ever. Our party left happy, and so did our tummies! All thanks to chef Juno!!!!!",

I grabbed the California roll sampler (3 plain, 6 spicy, 6 crunchy). You wanna start with the go-to stuff when trying something out for the first time. It was 7 dollars! And there are 15 pieces! Man was it good too. A little eel sauce on the crunchy was great. Spicy had heat and flavor. Plain was a good staple.   I plan on going back many times. Next I want the orange roll (california with masago on top) or their sushi lunch special. I don't recall prices over $10 in the grab and go case. It's really a yummy lunch if you just want to head back and eat at your desk.  Great job Harumi,  you made a regular out of me.",

We were a party of five, and she said she could not split our check. Rather, we had to do it ourselves and write it down for her. It's not a big deal, but it was weird she would just refuse to write it down herself. I've waited on tables, and a party of five ordering one or two rolls each is not hard to keep straight. Just requires a little more effort.   As for the restaurant itself, it doesn't really have much on the menu besides sushi, which is mostly rolls. I ordered the Philadelphia roll and requested seaweed on the outside rather than rice, but our server told us it would be an additional charge, which is bizarre since it's the same amount of food just flipped inside out. They also forgot my friend's roll and it took so long we almost cancelled it. For dessert, she brought us mochi instead of regular ice cream. Overall, mediocre food, but the waitress was a downer, acting like everything she did for us was a huge effort.",

We stopped in on a Friday night after a friend's recommendation.  He also recommended the Oh My God roll, which we ordered.  The name, though a little goofy, was fitting.  Our friend also recommended that, if given the chance, we chat with the owner, Juno.  It was a slow night so rather than pick from the menu we asked our waiter if it would be possible for Juno to make us three rolls of his choice.  She seemed stunned by the request but asked him and he obliged.  Next came three rolls that weren't on the menu but definitely should be - each excellent.  Juno came over and chatted with us for a while after that and his stories, energy, passion for sushi, and genuine kindness was the perfect ending to the perfect meal.  With restaurants in NYC and Arkansas, Juno next wants to open a second, larger place in Phoenix - possibly Scottsdale or Arcadia - with live entertainment in the way of taiko drums.  Hopefully that will happen soon.  We need more places, and people, like this in town.",

You feel like a small town family feel as soon as you walk in! We got a caterpillar roll- which he put a caterpillar smile on (Aww!!), California roll (love the black rice) vegetable tempura, and some ramen noodles topped off with some saki bombers. What a great place! I can't wait to go back with friends and share this place!",

First we were told we couldn't be seated. About a 1/4 of the place had reserved placards but some reservations weren't until 30 minutes after. As we were about to leave, I guess the hostess changed her mind and pulled two tables together for my party of 6. I've been here many times and have never felt so rushed during a meal. This used to be my favorite sushi spot in Phoenix, but I left disappointed after taking out-of-town friends here. Oh, and I think they took off their check-in offer of miso soup and edamame.",

    "text": "The husband and I went to Harumi a couple weekends ago on our self made 'food crawl.' We were going to go to Squid Ink (which I like very much), but decided to come here as they have such wonderful reviews. Now, this review isn't totally fair because we only tried one roll, so maybe other items are much better. Anyway, this place is set up kind of fast foodish, definitely set for the lunch crowd. This made it a little confusing at first whether we should line up at the counter or sit at a table. We were then directed to sit at a table by a young waitress who was friendly, but awkward. We ordered just a spicy tuna roll to see how this place did basic sushi. Then we proceeded to wait and wait and wait. After awhile. the waitress brought some edamame since we had to wait so long (guess they had a big party tray to make?), so that was nice of her. When we finally got the roll, I noticed there were no little dishes to put soy sauce/wasabi..... and no one to be seen to ask for one. Oh well. The spicy tuna roll was kind of terrible.... I am no expert on spicy tuna rolls, but the ones I have had in the past were a slice of tuna or a minced tuna in the roll...this was like a tuna mush. There was absolutely no texture. Putting in my mouth was awful...it felt like fishy baby food. The purple rice was nothing special, not any better than regular rice. Anyway, after choking this roll down we then waited and waited and waited some more for our check. The place was not busy enough to warrant the ridiculous wait times. I won't be rushing back here for sure.",

I'm very picky about sushi , especially in Arizona (considering I'm from a place where there is an ocean) I know it's hard to find yummy fresh sushi here in AZ. I gave Harumi a shot after reading many reviews of them online as well as other places. The food is DELICIOUS! we ordered 4 rolls. Las Vegas , Oh My God , Philly , Spicy Tuna. My room mate ordered a soda and our bill came to be only $36 bucks. Our rolls had 10 pieces each! they use purple rice , and the fish was fresh and it tasted VERY good. I highly recommend this place and I know for sure i'll be back! I almost hate how close it is to my house because I'm going to want to eat there everyday! But truly it is very good , the service is good . The tables are pretty close to each other so we were able to interact with our table neighbors which I LOVE. If you're considering another sushi place.. STOP and just go to Harumi. You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Mediocre at best. There are far better sushi restaurants in Phoenix/Glendale than this place.  My husband and I are sushi lovers and are always trying new sushi restaurants. We traveled 40 minutes from Surprise to try this out. We were disappointed.  The rice they use is black/purple and DOES NOT taste like sushi rice. It doesn't taste right and it makes the rolls taste abnormal. At every sushi restaurant, we always make sure we get the rainbow roll to gauge the quality of their raw fish.Their raw fish is okay.. definitely not great quality, but not the worst either.  If you love rolls with lots of sauce, then this place is for you. I, personally, don't like TOO MUCH sauce on my specialty rolls... just a little is enough for me. But they DRENCH those suckers so much that all you taste is sauce with weird black/purple rice.   There DINNER MENU is very small... and does NOT include bento boxes. All they have are rolls, sashimi, ramen, and the typical appetizers. Their LUNCH menu, on the other hand, have bento boxes.  Last but not least, the PRICE is a little more than what I'm used to for the same quality. The \"SPECIAL\" we were offered for uni/sea urchin was $5 per ONE piece. That's a little expensive. I can get good uni/sea urchin at \"Sushi Catcher\" for $8 per TWO large pieces.   FYI, be prepared to pay for parking since it is located downtown-ish. It costs $1.50 per hour for meter parking.  We won't be going back.",

Note: I'm not saying the place doesn't have a nice style - but it's not super sushi snob either(which I'm FINE with). What's the best thing about this place? They use Black Rice!!! So much tastier and much much MUCH better for you than junk husk white rice - if you don't believe me do some 'Googlin! I had the \"Chef's Choice\" - 5 Nigiri, 6 Sashimi, plus Oasis roll for $27.  The fish was very fresh, great taste, and good quality(high fat, great color in the tuna particularly).  This order was a perfect meal size. It almost seemed like there was much more than what is listed.  The Oasis roll is very large. I also had a Stuffed Jalapeno - excellent! The staff were extremely attentive - my water glass never went more than half empty and I was parched. The sushi came quick but I could see the master sushi chef expertly cutting away at it.  He also sent out some tempura fish as a bonus.",

We had 2 servers taking care of us, Mary and another Asian lady. They were both very nice and sweet! We started ordering and when our sushi came out the rice was purple! I started thinking \"omg what the heck, it's not gonna be good.\" I was wrong! It was the best sushi I had so far! The rice was so soft and the tuna was so fresh. We also order Gyoza and those were pretty good. More sushi came out and let me say, they were all good! I love it here. The vibe is very nice and the decorations were very modern. Great service, fair price for sushi, I will definitely come back again!",

Had to take leftovers home and I usually never do that but couldn't finish everything. The rice is purple but don't let it fool you. It still taste the exact same but adds a nice signature touch to their way of doing sushi. They also have grab and go sushi premade for those busy and on the go. Would definitely recommend and eat here again.",

No one came to introduce themself or take my drink order until 15 minutes after I was seated and that was ONLY because I had to get up and ask the cashier why the people that were previously standing in the line behind me got taken care of first. The cashier immediately felt guilty and took my order that second. She waived my drink charge.. Of unsweetened tea when I specifically asked for sweetened tea. That was the only time I saw my waiter.. when she took my order. I sat there for about 20 minutes AFTER I was done with my food hoping that someone would come with my check but nope.. I had to get up AGAIN to ask the cashier.. I left what I owed and left a tip for the hard working sushi chefs.   P.S: the sushi presentation was nice. Ive had better nigiri. The sex in the city was 40% cream cheese. It tasted like it was rushed out. Very disappointed.   Don't know if I'll ever visit again",

I rate this below average for sushi -- not sure how it stacks up in Phoenix.    First, be aware the sushi is all made with Forbidden Rice (also known as black or purple rice).  It is supposed to be healthier.  However, it seems to have been the cause for sloppy rolls that failed to seal all the way around each roll.  It tasted fine, and is probably nice to have for the health benefit, but given a choice I would not choose this again.  Don't bother with the OMG roll.  They wrap it in tin foil and heat it over some burning alcohol or other, and it isn't really very tasty.  Just a muddled mess.  For flavor and freshness I give 2.5-3.0 stars For presentation, I give 2 stars due to the fall-apart rolls For creativity and presentation I give 2 stars.  The server was polite, but mostly disconnected and more interested in a book she was reading at the counter.  Also, I had to park in paid parking behind the restaurant -- not a big deal, but cost me $10 extra for the experience.  I could have certainly avoided this by going somewhere else.  I've had a ton of sushi, so I think this is a reasonably accurate review of Harumi.",

For appetizers, we had edamame ($3) & miso soup ($1.50 each). For our main entree, we had the 6-piece nigiri, 6-sashimi, & 6-Oasis roll (tuna,  salmon, crab salad, and avocado wrapped in cucumber) sushi combo ($27). That combo was VERY WELL WORTH IT, considering the sashimi pieces were large and could be cut into two pieces (probably about the average size for other sushi places).

The place was super busy at 8pm (we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table of two), but that inspires confidence in the circulation and freshness of their fish. We ordered the seaweed salad, spicy salmon roll, sweet potato roll, and oasis roll. Portions were pretty good for the price. My favorite was the oasis roll, but everything was great. At the end, the chef gave us two complementary pieces of nigiri (perhaps because we were seated in front of the sushi prep area?) as \"dessert\"! I will definitely be back to try their other rolls.",

They're located in downtown Phoenix and its a small restaurant so at dinner time, there's almost always a wait! It's worth the wait though. Something that makes this sushi restaurant stand up above the rest is that they use Black Rice which cooks out to be purple. It has better benefits than brown rice but has the consistency of white rice, which is fantastic! The food comes out so fast it's almost unbelievable. My favorites include the Shrimp Tempura appetizer (it tastes like breakfast sausage for some reason and it's so incredible), Seared Salmon Nigiri (they gave it to me complimentary one time and I've been addicted since), and I always order the Mini Combo Roll so I can get a few of my favorites. Honestly, there's never been a roll there that wasn't good. You won't be disappointed with this place so come with an appetite! You'll be happy to know that you're supporting a small business as well!",

HANDS DOWN, HARUMI IS THE BEST! It has amazing, fresh, unique sushi - seriously, probably the best and most flavorful sushi ingredients in the valley! - along with a warm, inviting atmosphere. We sat near the sushi bar and got to watch the owner himself preparing sashimi and maki with skill and care. He was SO HAPPY and cheerful to be there and seriously loves what he does! The whole time he was calling out to greet customers from the sushi bar and checking with us personally to ensure that the food and experience were satisfying. He joked and went around to all the tables to talk a little with each customer, and his presence was seriously so warm and sincere and humble. He even gave us a few slices of strawberry mochi, which of course is going to get on my good side! It's personal touches like that which make Harumi really stand out in terms of its atmosphere, customer service, and consumer experience. It ensures that we'll keep returning to Harumi time and time again - and if you haven't yet, you need to!",

The sushi itself is quite interesting. They use black rice instead of the usual white rice which is a healthier alternative. I ordered a few rolls the first time for lunch, which was decent. However, it was my second visit for dinner that piqued my interest. I ordered the omakase ($35), which is the Chef's choice of sushi. This was a price of $40ish plus the hot tea I ordered (which came in a cute teapot). The food was good, but the service was even better. They're extremely friendly and just super. At the end of the meal, they gave a complimentary mochi dessert. I would definitely go again for the food and the people there.",

We ordered the old faithful spider roll just to be objective ( to be honest we were in a mood for certain things we usually eat at sushi places that this menu just didn't have ) . One of the servers gave us some free soup, the roll arrived in good time and the flavor was adequate ( not the best but certainly not the worst ) . Over all experience not so pricey, very friendly but for the more experienced sushi goer you might want something more?  !",

But it's not the ambiance that dropped the star. When the food is this good who cares? No, it was the service. Consistent exceptional service over time would make it so you couldn't get a seat at this place. There is no excuse for weak service because it will all come back to you.
