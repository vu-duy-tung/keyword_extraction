For a $15 burger, this doesn't hold a candle to four peaks, joes farm grill, or a number of other places. I won't be returning here. Not because anything was bad... there's just better options.",

The bartender looked at us but said nothing. A server brought food out to a table but didn't look our way. This is a Monday night at 8:00. They weren't busy and if that's the type of service they provide on a regular basis, that explains why they weren't busy. After waiting for at least 5 minutes without any staff interaction, we left. We will not return. We took our business, and money, elsewhere.",

Maybe I'm spoiled living in the arm pit of Arcadia but I have the attic zinnburger delux burger hop daddy all pretty close by. For Travellers staying at the hotel this is the perfect spot. Great selection of drafts and beers in general. Very clean spacious modern looking spot that locals would be shocked to find at 44th st Mcdowell. I think I'd be more likely to hit it up for happy hour then do legit dive bar hopping nearby... Because I have a sweet tooth maybe I get wowed by the dessert choices and bump it up a star down the road... Fwiw I had the classic this time and bbq bacon last time which was definitely more memorable... Just bummed the house signature burger is blah",

Despite multiple signs advertising happy hour starting at 4. I spend about five minutes walking around the entire restaurant before I take a seat at the bar and then decide to call the restaurant. I hear the phone ring on speaker for about another minute before someone emerges from the back. Employee seems disoriented and confused. I informed him about my to go order which he tells me he never received. If the service is any indication of the food it's probably a disaster as well.

The restaurant was not busy at all, and it took 25 minutes to get our burgers.   Then after specifically telling the server that I did not want a pickle anywhere near my plate, ugh.... pickle spear with its juice running into my onion rings.   He did bring me a new order of onion rings, but I think they were ones sitting in the back, since the first order was hot and fresh and the replacement cold and soft ish.    My wife ordered her burger medium and hers was medium well, I ordered medium rare and it was close, but a bit underdone and the meat was cold.   I assume they took mine off earlier than hers and just let it sit.    I expected a lot more than two mediocre burgers (one with fries and the other with onion rings) a water, and an ice tea for $35.00.   Won't be back.  Too bad, I really hoped to have a great burger place between my wife's work and mine where we could meet for lunch.  Ed in Phoenix",

I had the philly and it was good don't get me wrong it just needed a little something more to get it out of the ordinary. Maybe more toppings, maybe a bun that didn't come right out of a grocery store.

The sandwich and rings were very good. 2) I sat at the bar and ordered food and beer, but the male bartender needs to do a better job to be aware of customers with empty glasses: patrons wait for greater than 10 minutes on a slow Wednesday night to be asked if they would like another drink. 3) a customer sitting next to me at the bar had to wait 42 minutes for her chicken sandwich and rings. That's a bit excessive when my order arrived within 10 minutes of ordering. 4) the same customer sitting next to me waited 13 minutes with her empty glass for the male bar tender to be available to ask for another drink...on a slow Wednesday night. The male bar tender does not know how to work with a sense of urgency and multi-task. 5) the female manager on duty did a good job looking around seeing if anyone needed anything, except for the nice female customer sitting next to me at the bar on a slow Wednesday night.  Bottom line, good food and drinks, but customer service can improve with training and care. After all, customer service is a choice to be delivered by anyone, but need guidance and development to 'delight' the customer.",

I also like that they have both indoor and outdoor seating. I ordered a cheeseburger which came with a pickle and I got a side of killer burger sauce that was recommended by the server. The burger was a little to greasy & nothing about the burger wowed me. The price can add up fast because everything is a la carte. your burger might be $9 but add the sides ( add $3.50) then you have to add a drink ( add another $2.50 ); its easily a $15 meal for just one person. I don't mind paying extra for the food but the food wasn't amazing. Also our server was nice but the service was slow and it took forever to get our food.",

We chose the patio which although just overlooks a busy intersection with pan handlers, did display a beautiful sunset that night.   The menu looked good, we thought the beer selection was good, especially having 12 draft beers.  Service was very fast and friendly.  I ordered the Uptown burger with mushrooms instead of a big portobello. They did forget the mushrooms altogether but I was actually starving and didn't care, didn't want to wait for mushrooms. We also ordered fries, they come in a cute little bucket. Everything was average tasting, I prefer toasted buns on a burger.  But all in all the convenience of the location will probably bring us back, we did hear there were good happy hour prices and would like to try the nachos",

    "text": "Not impressed. I was here because there were no other food options in the hotel (Holiday Inn and Suites, Airport North) open at 11:45am for lunch. Upon entering, I looked around for a server and found none. There WAS one bartender who told me to choose a seat anywhere. Ok. I chose a seat and waited for about 5 minutes for someone to come by. When the server arrived, I asked what I could get fast because I had a conference starting up again at 12:15pm. Not much, was the answer. Also, when I asked how long it would take for my order to arrive if I put it in now, I was told 30 minutes due to high volume.  The place was NOT BUSY. Strike one.  Strike two was when I spoke to my server again and asked for an order of fries. She looked at me, said \"Devon is your server,\" then walked away. That made absolutely no sense to me.   When she walked by my table again, I asked her what she meant by \"Devon is your server.\" I guess I looked a bit annoyed because the manager came over and asked me what the situation was. I explained that I had very limited time for lunch, was hoping to place an express order, and that the server told me that any order at the time would take at least 30 minutes. The manager said that was not correct and got some fries for me because that was really the only thing I could get quickly, i.e. within 5 minutes (I was cutting it pretty close to the afternoon session of the conference).   When I asked if I could finish my fries at my original table, the manager said she would prefer it if I would move to the high top table beside the bar, since I wasn't getting a full meal and was going to leave soon. Um, ok. I thought that was a little rude, but she comped my fries, so I guess we're even.  Overall, I would not come back here. Maybe my original server was new, or perhaps the kitchen really was overloaded with orders. I wasn't pleased with the service and I do not want to waste my time or money at a place that doesn't appear to want me or my money.",

    "text": "Was looking foward for this Holiday Inn burger and beer restaurant to open and waited until yesterday to try it out for lunch. Opted for a table instead of sitting at the large bar. Ordered a single beef burger, all the veggies, blue cheese, house sauce (server said it was \"just like 1000 Island dressing\") and onion rings.  The space is pretty sparse with minimal decor/decoration. One large group/communal table sat a group of at least 10, 7 sitting at the bar and people were at five to six  tables. Everyone was in a great mood and resulted in the place being really loud.  Food came out on a half sheet pan. Burger, pickle slice and a small galvanized tin bucket for the onion rings.  The burger was pretty close to the ordered medium rare temp, and a small amount of blue cheese was beneath the meat. The onion rings were awesome....all 5 of them. At $3.50 or .70 per ring they had better be good.  Had to bypass the nice beer selection as this was a work day. Expected a few bumps, food coming out slow and had to pay at the bar as the server looked like he was on the phone with the register/point of sale system problems. The bartender was quick to overcome the problem by ringing up a new order and he was able to cash me out in just a few minutes. Again I came in expecting these opening week jitters. While the food was OK the bill was over $13, without tip, for a 1/3 lb. single patty blue cheese burger, all the veggies, 5 onion rings and a glass of wate. If one were a business traveler with an expense account and ended up staying at the Airport Holiday Inn you wouldn't blink at the check amount. However, being a local who knows where a lot of great burger places with lower prices that are just as far of a drive is another matter.",

Our waiter, Larry Legend, had a great attitude and a lot of energy. He kept my drink full which is the most important part of eating out, at least in my opinion. He also had a smile everytime he came over.  I had a veggie burger with a fried egg add on which was awesome. It made my mouth and tongue so happy.

There is a full bar and good assortment of local craft beers, plus a multitude of TVs at the bar and booths in the dining area, making this a good place for a game or for casual dining.

    "text": "I was excited to try this place, and it was okay. Not great, but just okay. You can definitely get a better burger at Applebee's. What inspired me to leave a review was that while this place is just \"meh, okay,\" it is OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive. I ordered lunch for four: one chopped salad with shrimp (which ended up being a regular garden salad with 3 medium-sized shrimp on top), 2 single BYOBs with bacon & cheese and a double burger with no extras (all 3 with onion rings, which you only get about 3 or 4 rings with each order) and my total for everything was $67 and change. This was take-out, so I can't comment on the service, but I will tell you that if they had given me the order total when I'd called it in, I would NOT have ordered from here. There is also no pricing anywhere on the website to reference. I feel for the employees because it is appears the business is poorly run on a higher level & very unorganized. When I arrived to pick up my order, their credit card terminals were down & they couldn't run my card for payment and the manager, not knowing what else to do, took my phone number & said he would call me to take my payment over the phone once their terminals were back online. Up to this point I was still not provided with a receipt or total for my order. It wasn't until an hour or so later when someone (not the manager) called to take my payment info that I was told how much everything had cost. Not cool.",

The salad I ordered was horrible.  It was a $13 salad and supposed to be served with mixed greens and rib eye (I asked what cut of meat it would be) The salad came with romaine only,  a couple of tomatoes and a few cucumber pieces.  The meat was chewy and definitely not rib eye. Very disappointing.  The waitress gave us a discount on the salad but it is not a place to go back to.  Not impressed.....",

    "text": "We were looking forward to a good burger while watching sports at the Burger Theory on 44th St & McDowell Rd.  Here was our experience: * No hostess was near the stand so the bartender yelled for someone to help us even though it was not hectic. * Many of the patio tables were filthy including the one we received.  Yet the person who directed us to this table never cleaned it; they left it for the server to clean. Never saw a bus-person working while we were there. * Short staffed on a sports evening resulted in slow service yet our waitress was running as fast as she could on her own. * The waitress took the order correctly yet the kitchen over cooked all our burgers (medium rare order resulted in a well-done burgers) and the fries were very greasy. * Our waitress apologized stating this had been happening all night.  Felt bad for her, because this probably lowered her tips even though it was not her fault.  After speaking with her manager, our server said we'd get a discount which ended up being a Veteran's discount along with the server's apology which was nice; the cooking temp. of our food was not the servers fault but the Manager should have came to our table to touch base with us.   If a burger restaurant can't cook the temperature of their burgers correctly then we will not recommend this restaurant to anyone even if they are staying at the attached Holiday Inn, which is a shame since there's plenty of seating and tv's to watch a game at this location.",

    "text": "I've been eager to try this spot since they opened at the hotel. Food looks good, local craft beer and a beautiful remodel- what more could I ask for within walking distance?   Well, I can't imagine going back. The problems started when my waiter, a nice young guy, brought me the menu. See, something was very wrong with what could be an amazing local draft list on happy hour. I saw that the Brown had the same description as the White Ale, and that the Kolsch was named incorrectly (Gold Road, not Old Road), the KiltLifter description had a typo and the Sonoran White Chocolate was described as a fruity hop bomb.   I called my waiter over to let him know that these menus were all screwed up and that folks wouldn't be getting the beers they hoped for- his response? \"Oh, hmm, I've never read the menu. I can just kinda describe them to you\". Problem is, I'm passionate about our local AZ beer scene, I know the beers well and some of the folks that work hard to get them on the menu at a new hip restaurant that caters to tourists- so I'm appalled that he couldn't care less. I requested he talk to his manager since this should be corrected ASAP, and he said \"ok\". So, that was that. I stuck with water since I'm still confused what they actually have on tap.   Our food was cheap- but really not impressed. The kitchen didn't put any dressing on my salad or on the side, so that was odd. Then my mom's nachos- which come with beans- had a ton of olives but no beans to be found. I mentioned this to our nonchalant waiter, who told her \"There are beans, I see them...here.\" And he pointed within inches of her plate- counting out 4 beans. Then he offered to get some more. Right. So that's how  that went. Paid out bill and luckily it was very cheap (with our waters) because the experience wasn't great. He was nice enough, just clueless- and he wasn't even close to the worst part.   I told my mom that I really hope they fix the menu since I'd looked forward to coming here often in the fall for football and craft beer. She suggested I tell someone else- so at the front I mention to who I thought was the hostess- that the menu wasn't correct - She interrupted me to let me know she already heard. I continued that I was so excited to see a hotel restaurant in my neighborhood feature our local beer and I just wanted them to get it right for the visitors- she said \"yea, have a good night\" and walked away. I can't remember the last time an employee was so blatantly rude. She didn't apologize, thank me for letting them know, assure me that management woukd address it- no, she walked away.   Now, I planned to go back- I planned to give them a few more shots. But to have both employees blow me off about a completely wrong menu? Unacceptable. The food wasn't nearly good enough to put up with that.",

I ordered a flatbread since I'm not usually a big burger person, only to be notified they were out of pizza. Instead, the chef send a lettuce wrap burger. Not really my the first logical substitute in my mind but okay.  Our order is also usually delayed, though I'm sure most of this time comes from the fact that we have to re submit second orders for half our team each time.   I can't speak to how well the burger is, since it was smothered in pickles which I personally can't stand. I will fault our office manager for that one, fine, but seriously, someone needs to get your ordering figured out so people can just order what they want and not worry about whether or not it is available. To date I haven't been able to try a SINGLE item I've actually wanted to try from this menu, which is disappointing.",

The burger and fries were very tasty. The service is really slow. The waitress took our drink orders and disappeared. Took our burger orders and disappeared. The burgers took forever to come out but were hot and cooked to medium well order.   The waitress did ask how was everything. The food was tasty. Then she disappeared and we waited a long time for the check. It was so long that I had to ask the hostess/other waitress to bring us our check.",

They did bring me a fresh burger, which was still only nominally better. It had no real flavor, no juice.  $9 for just a burger if I wanted, sides were another  $3.50. I paid $3.50 for 6 onion rings? They tasted frozen. Fries were cold, but seasoned. Decent Happy Hour $2.50 for domestic draft. The service was slow, we asked for a booth, there were plenty, but told it was \"reserved.\" Typical hotel food, over-priced, frozen, meh  Go to Burger Rehab, The Grind or CB&CB if you want a good burger. Get the real thing, not a theory.",

    "text": "We came here for lunch today because my dad had driven by it and wanted to scope it out. It was $30 for two burgers, onion rings, and one soda - and there are dozens of other places I would've rather spent that money. It feels like a Red Robin meets a Buffalo Wild Wings with Denny's style service.   We got there just after they opened; it's a tuesday in the middle of summer. There were only a few tables making them clearly over-staffed (a bartender, 4 servers, a manager, and a guy that just stood around) but no one was seating the tables. We were halted at the door while the party ahead of us looked to choose their own seat. The sign said \"wait to be seated\" though the previous group hadn't, so I asked if it was \"seat your self.\" the bartender told me one server had gotten a table and the next server up would take us... Hire a host.  I went to the restroom after being seated and the toilets wouldn't flush; none of them. I told the manager when I came out and she looked at me and said, \"Oh, they turned the water off!\" That's pecuilar, gross, and I'm pretty sure illegal during business hours. She made no apology and lacked any sort of authoritative presence. She was also walking around, drinking a cup of water - which isn't a good look. Our server was awkward - nice but not helpful, kind of timid. I felt like everyone there was experiencing their first day in the hospitality industry; it was sort of painful. They didn't really know the menu or how to act with customers.  I ordered a burger, but then heard another server talking about the special Sonoran burger and ran over to change my order. I joked with him about not telling me about the special - he told me he didn't even know they were doing that...   The burger that came out was pretty lame for $9. It had way too much limp iceberg lettuce under the patty, and the jalapenos and sriracha mayo were just thrown in the center. This is not a $9 burger, it made me feel like it was someone on the line's first day too.  The food tasted decent. I had a turkey patty, my dad had all beef and said it was good quality. We enjoyed the onion rings, also. They were nothing special, but were cooked well. We both said we'd never come back for it / could've made the burgers at home - but it filled our need to eat.  It's clear they put a lot of money into the building; hopefully they can work out the kinks..  Pros: Turkey patty, veggie patty, chicken patty option in addition to beef burgers Large beer list Lots of tvs (if you're into that) Clean feeling (except for the toilet flushing incident.) Nice patio (when it's not melting outside)  Cons: High price for what you get Unprofessional / awkward staff Sloppily put together burgers for $9-$15 per burger Water was turned off during business hours making toilets unflushable Weird Vibe",

The hotel has made incredible remodeling done right. The restaurant has a great marketing options. I would suggest that you market the sports bar to area University Alumni clubs. A area (Dallas Tx) restaurant /sports bar recently reached out to our club and started hosting our watch parties every Saturday for the  football season. The restaurant has more than doubled there sales and in return donates 10% of the sales to the scholarship committee. The Alumni club now uses there business to watch hockey, basketball and other games.  The business is a little slow but with the right marketing it could become a great sports bar. I am sure that there are numerous local Alumni clubs that would love this venue.",

Myself along with my fiance, 3 kids under 6-(I over tip when we go out due to my bebe's kids) and my fiance's nephew went on a Friday night to Burger Theory. Pass it driving all the time-looks like a cool spot. That's about it. Looks cool. If your just going to drink and watch a game it's perfect. Not the cheapest, but a nice spot! The place is dead! We wait a few minutes to get seated by our waiter. Kind of a dry guy-not the most friendly dude in the world.  Place our drink order and they come quickly. Place our food order and this is where we run into a problem.   2 of our meals come out 35 minutes later. My kids and fiancee nephews food is nowhere in site.   I ordered the chicken tenders appetizer...wow...it was the burnt left over debris from the bottom of a deep fryer basket! In 33 years I've complained MAYBE 3 times at a restaurant! It's not in my blood to be one of those guys...I have respect for myself and others. However this was appalling! My girl starts getting pissed that the kids don't have their food-10 minutes later the server comes (separate employee brought the \"food\" to us) and says he forgot to put the rest of the order in. We decide to high tail it out of there. I have 3 hungry kids...  Ask for the manager and she profusely apologized and offered to cancel the whole check including my beer.  I insist on paying for the beer to tip the server something (even if he wasn't the most friendly guy and messed up)  McDonald's for the kids it was!  Sucks cause this place looked good!   Thanks to the manger for doing the right thing!!",

Wings: we got 7 wings and even with the happy hour price it came to more than a dollar per wing. They were good, not great. We also ordered the flatbread tuscan chicken. It had very little flavor and was over in just a couple of bites.  Beers were fairly priced, but other reviews note the emphasis on local brews, and other than the standards you see everywhere else, I didn't see anything special.

McDowell, but there is a separate entrance so you don't have to walk thru the hotel.     The dining/room bar area is modern and upbeat, and the patio is surprisingly easy to have a conversation on, considering the proximity to McDowell Rd.  It was nearing sunset when we visited, and the staff kindly lowered the sunshades on the patio for us.   Burger Theory has a great tap list that focuses on AZ beers, plus a generous daily happy hour 4p-7p with drink and appetizer specials.  Tyler was our server and she was awesome!  All of the staff was very friendly and gave this place a nice vibe.   The Farm Fresh burger came loaded with portobello mushrooms and roasted peppers, all dripping with cheese.  It was delicious!  They offer a lettuce wrap (by request) if you prefer to swap out the bun.   There were a number of other burgers, salads, and mason jar desserts that I wanted to try. We ended up enjoying burgers and several drinks for two for under $40.00.  I'll definietly be visiting Burger Thoery again soon!",

Can't fault a place after that for taking ownership...I ordered the single with all the veggies and added bacon, their special sauce and a fried egg with a side of onion rings. This burger came out perfect! The egg was cooked perfect and on the first bite all the yolk oozed out and it was a mess just like I wanted. It was like breakfast in between 2 buns. The onions rings as well were a great addition plus I thought you can get fries anytime and these were super good....sorry to see they are getting some tough reviews because the layout of this place is great with tons of outdoor seating and and tvs everywhere to not miss any game.

They were a little busy but nothing crazy. All of the staff was very kind with a smile on their faces. I picked up my order at the bar and the bartender Camilo was so pleasant. He had taken my order over the phone and when they brought out my food he remember to get the extra condiment that I asked for. He used my name and didn't make me feel rushed for only having a to go order making the quick stay pleasant. Thank you and if I'm ever back in town I am definitely coming back.",

Staff: the staff my group interacted with very nice and courteous. We did have an issue with one of the orders, and the wait staff gave a few suggestions to correct the error.  Food: The meals are on the pricey side for the portions given. A burger is between $9 and $15 and the sides are additional (between $3 and $5). I've eaten here twice and the food has not really improved. My burger had WAY too much sauce on it and very very greasy.  Gave 2 stars because I go to places to eat for a good price and the food was meh and the price was higher than I would expect for what given. This area is trying to revitalize itself and there are many other options available which have much better food options.",

I would have done better getting my burger and fries at a fast food joint.  I expect a whole lot better in a sit down burger bar/restaurant - especially with a title like theirs.  Most of their stuff is smothered in bacon and they skimp on the dressings and condiments.  With all the beer you would think they would make their own beer-battered onion rings.  Nope!  Poorly prepared food and cheap ingredients.  They do have a nice selection of specialty beers, though.  They should change their name to Beer Theory.  Then maybe they would learn how to make a True american burger.  My server was a nice, attentive young man (Francisco).  Because of him I give this place two stars Instead of one. I do not recommend this place for burgers.",

I love to speak to my waiters and joke with them so they feel comfortable I guess wrong on my part the guy that was waiting us didn't care for it so I left it alone. We ordered some drinks and he walked away so fast we didn't even get to order an appetizer. We were told it was happy hour and that the drinks would be $5 I look at the happy hour menu and it says it's $6 okay no biggie. We ordered margaritas idk what the bartender made but it Def wasn't a margarita I asked if we could try something else since the drinks tasted off. The bartender made the drinks and then I saw them sit there and the waiter walk past them at least 3 times. I almost went and got them myself, he came with the food so we were happy and then brought the drinks. Tried the new drinks  and they also didn't taste like what it was supposed to be, at this point I gave up on having an alcoholic beverage. I'm giving two stars because the food wasn't bad it was pretty good. I really wanted to like this place but the service was really slow, it took the waiter 30 minutes from the time we asked for the check til we had are card back so we could leave. Given that he had to fix our check to take my drink off I still don't think it should have taken that long for us to pay and get out of there. Don't think I'll be returning.",

    "text": "Let me preface this... This is not the review I was anticipating writing. And that's because this is the second time I've been to Burger Theory with my co-workers. The previous visit was good enough to entice us to come back. This visit was especially disappointing.  Most of the five guys (burger pun un-intended) I ate lunch with today, were there for the first visit as well. Collectively, we agreed that after the number of miscues today, we don't see much of a reason to return.  The highs: The environment is modern, inviting and clean. Regardless of the service, the burgers are really delicious. My BT Burger with the house KGB sauce was cooked perfectly (med rare) last time. And the Lone Star (this visit) with bacon, BBQ sauce and an onion ring was also wonderful, despite being cooked med well.  The lows: We chalked up the poor service on our previous visit to the fact that Burger Theory had just opened. I guess we were optimistic that the opening jitters had subsided. Unfortunately, they haven't.  Our server today was very friendly, but that will only get  you so far. Today we were celebrating a birthday. We waited a very long time for the food to arrive and the birthday boy didn't get a turkey burger as requested. It was beef and over cooked. He sent it back and ultimately waited so long for the re-cook that he had it boxed to go. The burgers didn't all arrive at the same time either. One of my co-workers asked for a drink refill. His glass was taken and never returned. When our server learned of the birthday, he insisted that he bring out the complimentary chocolate mousse. Because there was no priority on getting the re-cook to the table, the mousse was all he ate.  Then, an attitude was detected when asked to split the check five ways. When the checks arrived, they were wrong. One drink was missing (finally, an error in our favor!) An order of fries was on the wrong check, as if one of us had asked for two orders. One of us was almost charged for the complimentary mousse! And last but not least, the cards were mixed up between a couple of books when they were returned.  I don't recall ever leaving a restaurant in such a bad mood, after eating something so good. The general mood was captured in my co-workers expression below... BT! Are you listening? Time to get your act in gear!",

The French fries were awesome but my chicken sandwich was burned and it ruined my sandwich. My husband ordered a triple hamburger with several toppings and when our food came he received a hamburger with one Patty on it which surprised us because even our waitress had made a comment about the three hamburger patties being so huge on the hamburger. We told the waitress That his order wasn't correct so they redid his hamburger and it was fine after that. The waitresses were all very nice and it's a nice restaurant but I don't think it's worth the price for Mediocre food.",

It's situated nearly on one end of the property and delivers to your room. Very nice, clean, simple decor. Not too frilly, not a billion tvs and sports memorabilia everywhere. Plenty of seating without being crowded.   The food was hit or miss. The burgers were higher quality than a McDonald's, but not on par with an Applebee's or Chili's.   The chicken wings were actually really good. I got them naked (sauce on the side) and extra crispy. 5 stars for those. I also ordered fries. I didn't get them. I wasn't charged for them but I didn't get what I ordered.  My wife ordered fish tacos and about half way through them stated that they were incredibly tasteless. We then realized that the savory white sauce the menu boasted was missing.   At this particular meal it took incredibly long to get our food. Roughly 20 minutes after ordering and we were on of 4 tables at the time.  We ate here for 4 days and nothing stood out more than the chicken wings.  The bartender poured the cocktails nice and stiff. That was a plus.  We did the free breakfast buffet each day of our stay. It was good. Wide selection and attentive staff.  If we every return, we will eat here as a last resort.",

The waiter seemed to forget the silverware, because when we received our orders, none of us had silverware, which was quite odd, and a bit cold--we had to get our own silverware from surrounding tables, and ask for the missing ones.   In terms of the order, my co-worker and I both ordered the burgers with coleslaw, and the other ordering onion rings.  Tasted well, and no complaints there.  My other co-worker had a grilled chicken salad, and she seemed to enjoy her salad as well.  My second occasion was when I ordered my meal to go.  Ordered from the room first, and picked it up to go.  Ordered a fish filet sandwich, and it was quite good!  Although it definitely filled me up for the afternoon, I was glad I didn't get hungry throughout the day because I ended up having this one meal for the entire day, as I was super busy at work.  Second experience was much better than the first, and they were quick with my order.  Overall experience wasn't too bad, considering that this was literally one of the few places for a sit-down dining experience in the area.  Overall grade: A-",

She got us seated, greeted, and had drinks in front of us in under five minutes despite clearly having about 10-15 other tables. We had the fried jumbo shrimp as an app and it was amazing! The rest of the food came out promptly (3 classic burgers and an Asian salad) and perfectly after we finished our appetizers and our drinks were never empty. 10/10 will absolutely be back",

Bathrooms are very clean and very contemporary decor love it. the outside patio felt good and tv screens are very nice.

I was skeptical of my order because I ordered a veggie burger and veggie burgers at most places are kind of blah. I ordered my burger with coleslaw, garlic mayo, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, and the other regulars, you know how a sandwich works. The burger was more than amazing. They were able to achieve a burger texture that was similar to eating beef. At other places you might encounter that rubbery or spongy stuff, not here. The coleslaw was great, the burger was perfect. If I still ate beef, I would still get their veggie burger over any real beef burger from any restaurant you pick; don't care if you're talking 5guys, or smashburger, or anywhere.

My boyfriend loves burgers and its literally 2 minutes from our house so after a long and chaotic weekend with a 7 kid sleepover, he and I went to dinner there.  We sat at the bar top and I cant remember what the bartenders name was but he was awesome.  Dark hair, very thin, not very tall, I think he wore glasses but I cant remember.  But he was awesome.  Very accommodating and efficient.  I work in the restaurant industry so I keep my eyes open for stuff like that. I had a veggie burger with boursin cheese (first time trying boursin cheese) and it was amazing.  Onion rings were huge and crispy.  Everything was fresh and made to order.  The ingredients tasted authentic versus manufactured.  I cant wait to go try their deserts!",

Meat was a littler firmer than I prefer (possibly over mixed and packed/formed too tight). Pleased to find out they make quite a few things in-house (signature sauces, etc.) and even have a special sporting even (NFL) LTO menu. Even many of the ingredients are higher quality than expected (fresh Wildflower bakery rolls, etc).   Noting, I did have different expectations once I found out they were connected to a hotel, but have no complaints other than there were not many servers on staff. TIP - when you notice that as you walk into a restaurant (especially at an off-time, always sit at the bar! we've learned this over time).  All-in-all a good gig especially if you're a hotel guest - very convenient. Do we need to go back? No. With our mecca of food in the PHX area we're still in search of the best burger out there and fellow yelp reviewers are lacking in giving places like Shake Shack, PV Burger Company and Hopp Doddy 5 stars - what!? JUST NO!",

    "text": "This would be a five-star review, if it weren't for the store-bought hamburger buns.  You know, a simple Brioche roll would elevate these burgers into total awesomeness.  Anyway, they describe it as a \"potato roll\".  I stopped in for a company luncheon and there were about ten people in my group.  We were immediately seated and beverages provided.  Our server - I think her name was Anise, was simply awesome.  Her service was attentive without being obtrusive, and she handled every detail and special request with a smile.  I forget the name of the burger I had, but it was the only one that was a half-pound patty.  I requested medrare and substitute Onion Rings for the Fries.  Anise asked me if I wanted a sauce with the rings (Hello CB&C- get a fucking clue!), and offered a variety.  I chose the usual, ranch.  They also have a nice selection of typical appetizers, salads, entrees and some specialty burgers, or build your own burger.  Beverages remained full while we waited for our lunch.  When my burger arrived, it was a perfect med-rare, lightly seasoned and delicious.  The rings were big and bready, perfectly crisped, although the onion itself was a bit tough.  No matter, the breading was fine without it.  The dining room is clean, and typical hotel-style, but well furnished, and the bathrooms were nearby and clean as well.  There is a very nice elevated outdoor patio facing the intersection, which I imagine could get noisy, but it was too hot to sit out there anyway, even with shade.  I will definitely be back.",

On this visit my lunch companion and  I ordered a  burger and a side of fries.  I have to admit, the burgers were good, but nothing really stood out.  The burger was well cooked and juicy and the french fries were hot and crispy.  However, considering sides are extra, I think $10 for that burger is a little much.  I don't mind paying extra for a gourmet burger, but this burger really wasnt gourmet.  Total for two burgers, one order of french fries, and two sodas was $29.  The staff did their job; they were accommodating without being intrusive.  I recommend you give Burger Theory a try and decide for yourself if its worth the extra cost.",

My husband ordered a double build your own and his was also cooked more than medium but overall still good. We ordered their chips as an appetizer.

The bun is a little heavy in my opinion, so the most recent time I went, I got the burger wrapped in lettuce, which I loved. The fresh crunch really complemented the BBQ sauce on the Lone Star. The one gripe I have is that because their fried egg was extra runny, the yolk caused the paper that the burger is served on to tear, and so since I was cutting my lettuce-wrapped burger, I ended up eating some paper... yuck! The shoestring-y fries were super hot and crispy and delicious though!   Vibe: The first time I went, I got weird vibes, because it's directly attached to a Holiday Inn, but I've gotten used to it now. Inside, it has an upscale-meets-sports bar feel. The service is nice, but not the most efficient. Last time I went, there was live music. The guy had a great voice, and he was just playing acoustic guitar and singing, but he was a little loud (and I was at the booth furthest from him!)  Parking is super easy, since it's part of the hotel. I've been working to take more pictures of food when I go out to eat,but I always forget when I come here...too excited to eat, I guess.

    "text": "So-so experience. The wait staff was very attentive, but the food was mediocre.  The chicken is very dry, no matter how you order it. (I had it for lunch and dinner different ways) I ordered the grilled chicken burger with avocado wrapped in lettuce in stead of a bun. I could barely find the avocado, and the there were maybe eight mushrooms total. For dinner I had the Asian chicken salad. There was about a half a chicken breast on a huge pile of lettuce. Again the chicken was dry and chewy.   My grandsons burger was ok, but nothing special for a place with BURGER in the title. Beware... they say the kids meal is free with a full price order if you are a guest at the hotel, but they won't ask you if you are a guest even if you enter from the hotel side... they will just charge you for it. I had to ask that it was removed from my dinner bill even after I told her I would be putting the bill on my room.  I pointed out that I was charged for the kids meal at lunch but they said I would need to go through some sort of drama to have it retroactively removed because that wait staff was gone. Seems like it should have been a simple fix.  Maybe the burgers they make for the kids are mediocre because they are free... perhaps the specialty burgers are better...not sure I will try again to find out. First impressions are everything   Very convenient being connected to the hotel.",

    "text": "Burger Theory has a lot of things I like about it, (Sunday NFL games and Bloody Mary bar) and some weird things I don't, (mostly average burgers and high prices). It's a three star rating in my book having eaten here many times since April of 2017 when we moved just down the street and am forced to go here. Service can be great, or you can wait forever and not be helped. Some food items are outstanding, like the salads and onion rings, some are just a theory still being studied...like the burgers. What's up with putting lettuce under the burger patty? Burger juice and mushroom juice all dripping into the lettuce for that delicious very wilted, warm lettuce we all crave, (sarcasm alert). Crispy lettuce on the side please! Or just bring me some of your awesome wings instead!  Besides the well designed logo and menu plus great wings and fire cracker shrimp, there is a lot to like at this place attached to the Hotel with TVs everywhere that only show news or the golfing channel it seems, (except NFL Sunday my favorite day to stop by). Sunday games, good appetizer menu, and a manager that seems to have improved this place in recent months, has raised my review from 3 stars to 4.   I will end by saying I took my brother and nephew here one day for lunch and the onion rings, fries, fish sandwich, cole slaw and chicken strips were all great! Service excellent. My brother enjoyed his burger with an egg on it as well, (not my idea of a good burger but whatever). We had a great time! Now I want that fish sandwich and onion rings tonight!",

    "text": "Well, my original intention was to write this review from the public bathroom less than 2 miles from Burger Theory, but as I sat there trying, I realized that I was too busy concentrating on keeping my insides inside of me. The intestinal exorcism was like nothing I have experienced before.   Decor - 4 stars. BT looks good inside and would fit in about 4 miles northwest of its current location easily.   Service - 3 stars. Aaron did an average job. He was a little confused on the \"Staff Pick\" beer which seemed a little strange since the staff picked it.   Pricing - 2 stars. Happy Hour draft is a good deal and is par for the area. 3 stars for that. They lose a star with their burger pricing which I will go into details on next   Food Quality - 1 star due to the fact that negative stars aren't an option.  We ordered the Firecracker Shrimp appetizer and the flavor wasn't horrible, but was served at a strange temperature.  Burgers(should be great as it's in the name) were tricky. The flavor wasn't the worst we've had, but the color of the patties was off-putting to say the least. We ordered both burgers medium, which Aaron said would be slightly pink(as it should) but they were served grayish with no pink. I've had plenty of burgers in my life and I am pretty sure this is the first gray one I've seen.  Fries were soft and warm - far from hot. Maybe were sitting around for a while. The flavor wasn't horrible though and were seasoned decently.  Onion rings were probably the highlight of the dinner. Not sure if they were fried out of a bag or not, but were above average in taste.   At the conclusion of our $71 dinner with tip, we made our way north. By the time we made it 1 mile to Thomas, I was desperately looking for a public restroom as I didn't want to ruin the seats of my truck and my clothes. BT has dethroned the champion of Intestinal Distress, Panda Express now and will be my go-to place any time I feel constipated.   On a side note, I will be back for Happy Hour beers... I mean, who can say \"No\" to a $3 local craft beer?",

    "text": "Worst service ever!!!!! I can't even comment on the food because after waiting for more than an hour we never got our food, although the lousy waitress was nice enough to bring by the check for everything that was never even delivered to our table.  Here's the experience -  First we were excited about trying the place as it seemed good based on the ads and all that. Me, wife, and two kids (1 and 7) arrive, get seated outside and order drinks - a couple kids drinks, and two beers.   20 minutes later, no drinks and we never saw our waitress. Complained to the manager who said she would get our waitress but she still did not return.  Another waiter who seemed to be on the ball walked by and we asked to place order with him. To his credit he did not make excuses and he just took our order and said he was sorry and would handle it.  Later the beers finally arrive from our original waitress - 2 bottles of beer - (no idea why it took 25 minutes to open two bottles of beer). The original waitress then apologized and said they were busy and she got tied up. We accepted the apology and thought maybe she will make it better.  Then we got no service and no food for another 20 minutes. Now it's been 45 minutes and again we complain to the manager and the original waitress. Both say they will take care of it and the manager says she will comp the meal. Also they do bring out the kids meals at this point (Mac and cheese and kids pizza).  Now another 25 minutes go by with no food and no service. I walk inside and tell the original waitress to make it to go if it's even close to being ready. She says she will.  Then the food still doesn't come but she brings the check to the table for us to pay. My wife says we aren't paying for this and already talked to the manager.  The manager then finally brings the food and try's to deliver it to the wrong table!!!!   It never ends. She then brings the food to our table and it's not made to go!!!  We were done. Waited more than an hour, never took a bite of the food so I can't make any comments on of its good or not, but the service absolutely sucks.   We tried to talk to manager again and she was nowhere to be found.  We spoke to a another manager named Carlos who was very apologetic. I told him I refused to pay for any of this due to what happened and he agreed we should not pay. He also offered to buy us a meal another time and gave us the number to call the general manager.  I'll give him credit as he was very professional, but if you only get that service when you get to the top guy at the place and everyone else does a bad job, it may be too little, too late.",

The service was also great.  We stopped on our way to a concert so told our server we were in a hurry and he did not disappoint! Got our food, ate well, paid our check and gone!   Side note: there is an affiliation with Holiday Inn which I think is a brilliant concept for travelers.  Don't have to eat at the cheezy diner next door or the basic hotel kitchens when traveling.

They have regular beef patties (single or double order), chicken, and veggie/portabello mushroom options. Everything that comes out is cooked to your expectation and absolutely edible. Don't forget to pair with a beer, the burgers are on the smaller side.  I ordered the farm fresh burger, the cheese was the highlight that added the saltiness and delivered most of the flavor.  The onion rings were huge, fries were crispy, and salad was a standard house salad with a side of ranch.  A bit on the pricier side and with so many other options available in the area.",

Crispy fried perfection and the sweet sauce (nothing but Mae Ploy But who cares!)  The double turkey burger was excellent. The slaw was on point but those fries tho! Man I'm glad I sampled them.   Once I was waited on the place was fine... I stood out front trying to obey the directive \"please wait to be seated\" for 5 minutes. Without an acknowledgement, I simply sat out on the patio where MNF was on... since no one was coming to my table nor the others who had patrons dotted around the massive space, I couldn't ask em to put the DUBs on the big screen. As I'm hating on NFL these days. Finally after another 5-10 just as I was about to abandon ship. A waitress i have not seen milling around in the main dining area shows up. I was so darn excited I went ahead and ordered in case she would disappear again.  Food came promptly and was darn good!",

Burgers sounded divine, so we decided this would be the spot to check out.  It's a nice spot.  Your normal run of the mill burger place.  We sat at the bar and had wine.  Not crazy expensive, so that was a plus.  For food, I decided on the Southwestern Burger.  The burger was good, but lacking.  It needed a kick... whether that be spicy jalapenos or some sort of hot sauce.  Burger patty was pretty tasty.  The fries were the star.  We ended up eating fries with a side of nacho cheese sauce later because the burger didn't fill me up, and we wanted another bite that wouldn't break the bank.  The bartender suggested that, and I was glad he did.  Service was pretty good.  The bartender was friendly.  A little lacking in service, but still pretty good for the hour of the night we were there.  Overall, a good burger place.  Nothing that will knock your socks off, but it's good.",

Arrived to a \"Please Wait to Be Seated\" sign at about 1:30pm on a Monday. My colleague and I didn't see anyone else in the restaurant. At about the 5 minute mark, with two other people standing behind us, I started to wander towards the back when the bartender suddenly appeared and indicated we could sit anywhere.   Another 8 minutes went by before we were greeted at the table by a waitress.   We placed our entire order, I ordered my burger medium rare and verified she has it correct.   The food came in about 10 minutes, not bad. That was the last time we saw our waitress before we had to flag her down, in an empty restaurant, to give us a check.   My burger was cooked well. It was terrible. But we didn't see any staff while we ate. No one. Everyone was in the back. So I smothered my incredibly dry hamburger in ketchup, choked it down (without any beverage refills) and after paying, left happy to never return to this dreadful restaurant.   The waitress never checked on us after the food came. Not once. Not even when she brought the check did she inquire if we enjoyed the meal.",

I was disappointed the last few times, but finally decided to splurge and try Burger  Theory.  Now, we like to joke about the name, but these burgers are not theoretical, they do exist! They were delicious, tasty beef and bacon, yummy seasoned fries, and good lemonade.  One thing though, you basically have to drive around the hotel to get there. The median islands make it hard to turn in depending on which way you're coming from. Service was also good, but they were not busy at all. We will probably go back when we're really in the mood for burgers and don't mind paying extra.",

    "text": "Burger Theory is a semi-upscale burger joint that's directly attached to the Holiday Inn hotel located off McDowell and 44th Street. We've passed by it several times and have always been curious, but reluctant to try it due to the mediocre reviews. Further research revealed that Holiday Inn actually owns it, operating as a chain connected to some of their hotels in other cities.   Well, it turns out those reviews are pretty accurate.  We stopped by during prime dining time on a Tuesday night and it wasn't very busy. I opted for the breakfast burger, which consists of an egg, bacon, cheddar, garlic mayo, and something called KGB sauce. Apparently, this is an acronym for \"Killer Good Burger\" sauce? My girlfriend ordered the \"classic,\" which consists of American cheese, onions, lettuce, tomato, the same sauce, and holding the pickles.  Everything was just standard-fare. My burger was okay, although if you're familiar with the area, you'll know that superior burgers can be found for identical prices. My girlfriend was annoyed that her bun started falling apart almost immediately, which is never a good sign.  French fries were fine, but again, simply fine is usually not enough to impress me these days. In short, don't go in here expecting anything special, because you won't find it.  Overall, I suppose if you're staying at the hotel, it's a respectable option for room service. But if you're out actually exploring the neighborhood for a good burger, this definitely wouldn't be my first choice.  Recommended for hotel guests only.",

One thing I did appreciate was the fact that they are open late(midnight on a week night). The place is well lit and there is a large bar in the center with booths and tables spread around the place. Parking was convenient as it is part of the hotel next door.  Now for the food. Subpar at best. My friend got a burger and fries and I went for the chicken flatbread. Now for a small Flatbread that wasn't that appetizing,it was surprisingly  $9. My friend stated that his burger was okay but there was really nothing to rave about. All in all, Burger Theory will not be making my top 15 in places for Burger and brew.",

I walked in at 7:15 p.m. for a to-go order 2 sandwiches onion rings and fries took almost 30 minutes. Plus $32 for a burger a fish sandwich 6 onion rings and Fries is it ridiculous. And the fact you charge a dollar more for onion rings and I only got 6. For real you guys need to fix your business model the only way you are surviving is because you are next to the Holiday Inn. I will never return nor will I recommend Burger Theory to anyone",

While the servers attentiveness and response times were excellent, the food was a completely different story. I feel that if I'm spending $40 for a burger, coke, and appetizer it should be a step or two above a run of the mill fast-food joint. The meat was so greasy and tasteless. Both top and bottom buns was heavily saturated in grease that you couldn't enjoy any of the \"craft\" condiments and toppings. I know a melt in your mouth burger when I taste it, but never a melt on the plate because of the excessive great. There was a lot to be desired with this one. Felt like it was a frozen, season-less slop of grease. On a positive note,the onion rings were pretty great.",

Ugh (Then again i do come from texas so i can be biast lol) the burger was also supposed to come with an onion ring but that was no where to be found. Everything that you wanted to be added was extra charge .. But i think $1 is crazy for 4 pieces of jalapeno is slighty over the top. All in all Paid 13.00 for a basic burger and fries.  Skip it.",

We tried three times to ask her where we should sit, and each time she proceeded to very blatantly ignore us! Finally, the waiter (Michael) must have noticed what was happening and kindly helped us find a seat immediately. Now at first, I just thought Karrie was just rude, and poorly qualified for the job, but after sitting for a few minutes I began to notice something. Each time an older white male entered the restaurant, Karrie greeted them with a warm (and very loud) welcome! She would say things like, \"Good morning! Have a seat where ever you'd like!\" Or \"Good morning! How are you?!\". After observing a bit longer, I noticed she only provided service (I.E. topping off drinks and bring tabs etc) to the same \"genre\" of customers (white males), and all of the minority customers were all serviced by Michael. Now, I don't know if it was the waitress' personal issue against people of color, OR if that is what management has instructed her to do, but either way, I will not support a business that allows blatant discrimination in any way shape or form.   On a side note, if I were basing my review solely on the service we received from Michael, then 5 stars hands down! If my review were solely based on the service that we observed from Karrie, I would give this place negative stars if I could.   If you are a person of color, please be aware of the blatant discrimination by the waitress or possibly management, and be sure to leave Micheal a good tip because he's excellent!",

Mind you, it's slow as ever. Finally received drinks and put in our order. This place only does one thing, burgers. I was asked THREE times how I wanted my burger prepared. We settled on medium, requested mayo on the side and the waitress was on her way. Food arrived, burger was well done and the bun showed OBVIOUS signs that mayo was scraped off after the cook realized his mistake of not putting it on the side. Acceptable at Wendys but not at a $15 burger joint. First and last visit.",

I had a double beef patty medium rare on lettuce with blue cheese and bacon. The burger was done to perfection and the blue cheese was amazing and yes the lettuce was so fresh! You notice I haven't said anything about the bacon, that's because it wasn't on there, but that's alright because the burger they produced was so dang good it didn't need the bacon! Yeah I will be bringing more people here for sure!! Thanks you guys, take care and keep the grill warm ;)",

You had 3 tables including ours. It was NOT busy in your restaurant. I'm not removing your name because you're who served us, if it was a great review you'd want your name plastered all over reviews right?  Finally it's not my style to run crying to managers about flies and other things like our visit. Like I said you were nice enough just not very attentive and no real evidence of attention to detail, ie: napkins, lettuce, fly swatter.  I'm definitely not going back to your place, and because of your rather tacky communication I'll be sharing this experience with friends instead of just being one of many reviewers here.",

Today I had a hankering for a burger.  Not a fast food burger. A fresh made burger with personality.  After driving past this place several times the name intrigued me. Today I explored.   Upon entering i was met with super friendly staff and a clean atmosphere. Seated at a low top the multiple televisions give a great potential for a Sunday morning football spot.     Ben was my server.  This guy knew his burgers. There were several burgers in the menu and the daily special which was a meat lovers.  In short imagine taking a deli and slamming it on top gourmet fresh made burger.  The juices alone are worth a try due to the freshness of all the meats. This was a mans burger. Piled high on top of a toasted gourmet bun.  The happy hour here for drinks is great too. Cheap local domestics and imports.   To top it off Bens knowledge of the menu and the suggestion of the Smores jar put this place over the top.     Amazing customer service   Thanks Ben",
