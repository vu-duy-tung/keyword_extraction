    "text": "Wanted to love it but extremely disappointed in the service & quality of pizza (burned).  Ok atmosphere, clean & approximately 16 tables staggered here & there. Staff was friendly & seated us immediately at 6:15 on a Thursday night. Order was taken quickly & the older female (owner) suggested pizza my 8 & 10 y.o. would like, but I felt rushed to order (she never took our drink order). We ordered water, the Bianca pizza  and antipasto family salad. The salad came quickly ($12), was large & very good but extremely heavy on the vinegar & oil. We never saw our waitress for most of our meal. After another 15 minutes, a young male server brought us our pizza with no serving spatula, no napkins & no plates. He set the pizza on the edge of our table & quickly left before we could ask for new plates (our current plates were swimming in salad oil/dressing). At first, the Bianca pizza looked amazing, but the thin under crust was extremely black & burned on 2/3 of the crust. I don't like burned crust! After 15 more minutes, we finally saw our waitress & asked for more water & to please put in an order for the Margharita Pizza as my kids were still hungry (12\" pizzas). She never asked how our meal was. By now, the place was fairly full. I only saw 2 servers for 16 tables. Finally after another 15 minutes, we flagged down someone to ask for more water & our waitress. Just then, a sweet older gentleman with a limp (owner) noticed our oily plates & offered to bring new plates and more water as ours were empty. He brought new plates & some extra napkins & took 2 of our 4 glasses away for water. We didn't see him again until our pizza came 15 minutes later, & he had forgotten to bring 2 of our 4 waters. Again, the second pizza (Margherita) was burned on both the top & the entire bottom of the crust. It had very little red sauce and the cheese was sparse. I could not eat it as it was just too burned on the bottom and was not good. Another 15 minutes went by with no check or offer for a box for our extra salad. I finally had to flag our waitress down & ask to order a piece of cheese cake and our check. She said, \"just a minute\". Finally, after another 10 minutes, she brought our cheesecake but nothing else. I then asked her again for a box & the check. Another 5 minutes went by to get our check. She never asked us how our meal was. Our favorite items that we could recommend are the Antipasto salad and their homemade cheese cake. The cheese cake was whipped, light, fluffy and delicious but not a very big piece for $5.50. Our bill was $50 (tip incl.) for two 12\" pizzas, one antipasto salad, one piece of cake & no beverages. If we go back, it will not be for the pizza! We will order different Italian entrees, salad or dessert.",

Had to wait for a table but went down the street (to another Triple D joint) and had a great german beer until our table was ready. Our group of 4 ordered 3 different pies (Stallion, Mediterranean and Margherita) and the chicken pesto lasagna so we could try as many menu items as possible. Our server was fun and helped us come up with our choices. All were fantastic and we completely devoured them. The pizzas had fresh toppings and great crust from the wood fired oven and the lasagna was creamy and cheesy. Highly recommended and would go back in a heartbeat. Great food and loved the adventure.",

This place hit a bit of a rough patch after they were featured on Diner's Drive-Ins and Dives for the first time. I suspect they weren't ready for the huge spike in business that DDD brought. Fortunately, they seem to have pulled it back together. Piazza does old-world style brick oven pizza, and they do it well. The crust is thin and crispy, the sauce is homemade, and the toppings are the real deal. Be prepared to wait for a table if you come on a weekend or during a big Glendale event.",

    "text": "My first impression of this place was only ok... Seriously, what is up with good pizza places in this city having ridiculously long waits? This place is tiny, tiny, tiny-- no more than a hole in the wall with maybe 15 or so tables. I suppose it's our fault for going the same week that the Republic gave the food a glowing review, but we waited an hour and a half.  Overall, I would say the wait was worth it once we sat down. They have a pretty good selection of wines at very reasonable prices, which was good, because we needed a drink after waiting. We ordered the fried ravioli app, which was yummy and had huge shavings of fresh parm on top. Their marinara dipping sauce has a little bit of spiciness to it, which is perfect.  The best part of the meal was the white pizza. It's absolutely delicious. It has a good thick layer of ricotta cheese, so it's like eating a cloud-- and you might think you just died and went to heaven, it's that good. My mom and I split it and that was exactly enough for both of us. I haven't tried the other pizzas, and after eating this one I don't know why I'd want to, but I am looking forward to going back.  PS-- I highly recommend the zeppoli for dessert. Perfectly fried little dough balls, still warm and covered in powdered sugar. Need I say more?",

A few minutes pass, waiter asks what we would like to drink.  We order water and get them right away, and wait to place our order. A minute or two later we our waiter asks what we would like, pizza of course!  Then is an awkward manner the waiter inform us they are out of dough.  What? at a pizza place, then you couldn't post a sign or have the hostess inform us? We had three separate people help us and no one said anything. I've worked in customer service jobs my whole working career.  Because of this, I am very patient about waits, missed or incorrect orders and overall human errors.  However, if you work at a place with a big neon PIZZERIA you can assume your customer is there for pizza.   We left, but now I can say I went to pizza place where they didn't have pizza.  Will I come back? Maybe, because it may have just been an off day for the three people working the front.",

The greatest thing was the mozzarella cheese. You can really tell it's fresh.  Also, we had a chocolate cannoli, because somehow I have lived this long and tried so many desserts, but never a cannoli. It was quite tasty, though it took a team effort for us to crunch through the shell with just forks.  Service was good. We arrived at 11:10 and we were the second group seated for lunch and the first to get our orders! It's cool to see the chef tossing the pizza dough in the air. The food was done in ten minutes.   I'm glad we found out this place from Check Please Arizona.

    "text": "We went there after seeing Glendale Glitters, because this place was written up in Diners & Dives. It has a New York atmosphere to it so we were sure the food would be great. Which it was--however, Phoenix has many great pizza restaurants. The customer service is what separates the choices. After we paid and the change was brought, the server said \" your change is $16, here are the bills,  and did you want the 86 cents?\" Both of our mouths were open because this was such a surprise question....if we knew, or were told the restaurant was collecting for a charity etc, it would not have been an odd question, but since it was, we asked her why she would ask, she told us that many people just want the bills back and not the coin......she said \"if you want it I have it right here, and can get it\", we said yes we wanted it..it took her awhile to bring it back, and when she  did, it was in her cupped hands--she gave it to my friend who had to cup her hands also because at least half of the change was in pennies.............we had to laugh because this was just so odd.......since she seemed to want that 86 cents so much, we changed out her tip to include it..............................the food was very good, however, we will never go back because of the way the server ended our experience there....and look how we are sharing that experience  (our change was 16.86, but she originally only brought the $16 in bills, not the 86 cents in change)",

    "text": "Still in search of better pizza than the average pies you find on the west side, and after reading some good things about al Forno, we decided to give it a try while cruising the chocolate festival in downtown Glendale.  All we ordered was the Filetti d.o.c. which is basically a spin off of a margarita pizza, but a notch higher on the flavor scale, and a house salad.  We added prosciutto (+ $3) for a protein with the added touch of salt.  The place wasn't super busy (and nothing fancy either, but good food and service doesn't need fancy) when we showed up at 4pm on Saturday, so the pie came out in less than 10 minutes.  Their wood fire oven is highly efficient.  As pizza goes, it didn't have the \"wow\" factor, but it was very good.  The imported pomodorini tomatoes were absolutely delicious, packed with foreign flavor, and added a touch of class to it's taste, but it definitely could have used and extra helping of garlic and basil (the garlic was pretty much concentrated right in the center of the pie, and disappeared as we worked our way to the crust).  The prosciutto was applied quite generously, but was barely cooked as the pizza was baked so quickly, and was so chewy it was hard to bite though, and doubly tough to cut with a knife.  Our only thought would have been to pan fry the prosciutto (a bit) ahead of time so after it bakes on top of the pizza it comes out a little drier and crisp at the edges (think bacon).  The salad was fresh and just fine thought the cherry tomatoes were a bit green, and are served on small plates, so you have plenty of spill-over on the table.  Over all, it was really good and a great afternoon treat, and without question the best pie we've tried west of 51st Ave.  The service was somewhat rushed as it appeared they were gearing up for the dinner hour, but better rushed than slow, right?  The unisex bathroom (there's 2) was somewhat dirty and could have used some attention, but it served it's purpose.  Overall, it was a pleasant experience and would definitely visit again if in the area.",

We had a party of 6, so we called for call-ahead seating and before I could even make a reservation, I was told all of the 'rules' for call-ahead seating (1.They will not seat you unless you entire party is present; 2. If your entire party is not there after certain amount of time after you said you would be there, they will give your table away; 3. You are only allowed 2 credit cards per table, no separate checks; 4. If there is a wait, you will only be allowed to dine with them for 1.5 hours).  When we got there, the place was half empty and our waitress seemed to have an attitude.  We ordered the Salvatore (San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, olive oil, prosciutto di parma, arugula and shaved parmesan), it sounded good, but the only flavor came from the arugula.  We also ordered the Dolce Diavolo (Sam Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, sopressata, calabrian chilies, basil and honey), which also sounded really good, but the only flavor was from the chilies, yet there were hardly any actual chilies on the pizza, just mostly the seeds which provided a lot of heat and nothing else.  They seem to think very highly of themselves since being on DDD and having a high demand of customers.  However, I think the poor customer service and poor products are not going to lead to many repeat customers.",

I would have given 5 stars, and I may be ultra critical, but I really didn't care for how noisy the chairs were. The metal legs were screaming against the floor every-time someone pushed their chair, and it sounded like nails a on a chalk board. Now for the food and service: Perfection! The waitstaff was very busy but attentive to our needs. They know their wine selection, and menu like the back of their hands and will give you a recommendation you won't  regret. Have you ever had homemade mozzarella cheese? Well look no further, so silky. I challenge you to find another Neapolitan certified pizza, outside of Italy or New York, as good. The cheesecake and Cannoli were also a very good ending to a wonderful dinner. Word of advice- get there early, boy are they busy! We will be back over and over and over.",

My friend and I arrived around 6:30 on a Wednesday evening expecting a dinner crowd, but to my surprise there was only one other table of guests!  I have to say, you cannot beat the wine prices - $5-9/glass.  We shared a spinach salad, which was so-so.  Next, the Margherita D.O.C. pizza with carmelized onions.  Unfortunately, the onions weren't carmelized, just slightly cooked.  I'm not sure if there was a mix-up in the kitchen or somebody back there doesn't know what carmelized onions are...  I felt like the bottom of the pizza was a bit soggy in contrast with the charred crust edges.  The flavors were there, but the execution could've been improved.  We couldn't resist the zeppolis (pillows of fried dough covered with powdered sugar - see pic) for dessert.  So good!    Overall, we were content with the food and the fast service.  I think La Piazza al Forno is a solid choice for pizza in the Glendale area, but did not make my Top 5 Valley Pizza Joints.",

My son got the spaghetti with sausage ....no flavor whatsoever.  We ordered the cheesecake at the end and those fried dough balls covered in powdered sugar. Then the waiter forgot about us. We ended up getting those dough things for free. I have tried them before at an Italian festival and the were so light and powdery delicious I thought I was going to experience that again. NOPE... the dough was chewy cold  and gross. Basically fried pizza dough. Well I can say the Carmel drizzled cheesecake was bomb.  I say go ahead and try it you may like it then you might not.

There was one more but I can't remember what it was. This was a hand written note and I found it to be in bad taste. We were not going to do any of these but it did not make me feel comfortable. We had to wait about 15 min. Not bad since we did not have a reservation. Bad because it was chilly out and there was no place to wait inside. They asked everyone to wait outside. We went into a close shop and looked around for about 10 min. or so. When we came back they said to stay close because a table was opening up.  We ordered four pizzas. Three margarita pizzas two plain and one with mushrooms. I had a pesto pizza with goat cheese. The pizza were good. Not exceptional as I had expected form the reviews. I tasted a piece of the margarita pizzas also and......... they were missing something. Can't put my finger on what but it was like it was almost an exceptional pizza if it had this one ingredient. I have had as good a pizza in many places. Will I go back? Probably except next time add a extra topping to see if it will make the pizza better.  Service was good. We were waited on quickly and got our food hot and a respectable time.  I still have a problem with sign. Very tacky and tasteless.",

There used to be a little bar area near the brick oven so I sat there the first time I went and it was great because we were able to talk with the son of the owner, I guess they are co-owners, and talk about the place and how much Triple D has increased their customer base. He was extremely friendly and of course, the pizza was fantastic. They have the best White Pizza I have every had. It is delicious and perfectly made. I have had it numerous times and have never been disappointed.  I would recommend this place to anyone!",

    "text": "The reviews on this place concerning their popularity are correct especially for dinner at La Piazza al Forno so we opted for lunch and were seated immediately. This is a smaller restaurant with a very \"homey feel\".  No frills but a really cool Italian/\"Mom's kinda place\" atmosphere and they have great service.    There were so many things we wanted to try, one of which was pizza cooked in their wood-fueled-brick-oven.  We tried the La Pizza Bianco ~ it has a mildly chewy somewhat thin crust, blistered and charred in spots.  It was a bit chewier than what I expected so we had to eat it with a fork, but still very tasty.  It had fresh mozzarella, ricotta, lots of basil and garlic, and their garlic butter sauce. This pie was delicious and it could possibly be good at repelling vampires but not a good choice for a first date with someone you're going to kiss afterwards...   They have a wide variety of pastas and salads to choose from as well.  On our second visit we tried their linguine with red clam sauce which was also very good.  The clams were cooked well, tender not over done like at most places and their marinara sauce was on point! We also order just a slice of pizza and side salad.  This was somewhat disappointing because the slice of pizza tasted somewhat old and of course reheated.  It did not have the same \"wow\" tasting factor as did our pizza on our prior visit.  We shared this with our server and she stated it was how they serve their slices and did not offer a new slice...    We ordered some New York Cheese Cake for desert and it was delish as well! Another person had a slice of pizza   This is a great place to go if you're looking for good Italian food and fantastic pizza! Our only concern was ordering just a slice that was old and reheating it is usually fine but not in this case, this slice was too old.  Next visit ~ don't take a chance and just order just a slice, order a whole pizza instead!  It's well worth it.",

We were greeted by Sandy who we had the pleasure of taking care of us through our dinner. So very sweet, made me feel like we were at her house for a friendly dinner.   We got the fried meatballs which were tasty as well as the caprese type salad (mozzarella, tomatoes and some herbs). Yummy! There were two items that were out of this world amazing.. The pesto lasagna and the margherita pizza with pepperoni.  I'm talking like you take a bite and sit there in shock as you process the flavors in your mind. I HIGHLY recommend getting these two items!!! I didn't think a margherita pizza would be that great but I'm telling you they do something that nobody else does. And that my friends I have no idea what it is lol but it's goooooood.   We also tried the baked pizza pie which was good.  We got a side order of bread that we also raved about. Perhaps we ordered the best items on the menu seeing other reviews. Either way we will be returning and then returning again.   Negatives: Nope.",

Service is usually good, ambiance is lackluster, Have had the Calzone with sausage lots of crust not much filling, Italian Stallion pizza is meaty and good that would be my recommendation, Bianca pizza was ok a little heavy on the ricotta cheese.  Chicken pesto  Lasagna is relatively tasteless covered in an underwhelming pesto cream sauce.  I clearly am the minority because it's good but I just don't get the hype.  Obviously Guy Fieri and Travel and Leisure disagree with me because of the national accolades so I'm clearly not a Pizza expert..... just thought I'd throw my two cents in.",

Spaghetti must have been on sale that week. The pizza crust is amazing the sauce has NO flavor at all cheese is fresh. We used to come a lot....that will sadly be our last time.

We added speck to this pizza and it added another great dimension of saltiness.  Moving on to the pumpkin cheesecake.  Part of me wants to say it was awful, but that would be for selfish reasons, to ensure there was more for me.  The consistency was so light and fluffy and the pumpkin taste was perfectly balanced.  I will definitely be back for more to try more amazing dishes.",

    "text": "So...it's been awhile since I have written a review for this place.  I have been back probably a dozen times, and it's still my favorite Neapolitan style pizza in Phoenix.  My buddy was in from out of town, and I wanted to take him somewhere good.  I was also going to branch out and try something new.  I had been eyeing their Linguini with Clams in red sauce for awhile now and decided that I would order it during this most recent visit.  We drove down, parked, walked down the block and then made our way inside.  We were seated immediately and placed our order.  I went with an order of the Linguini and Clams in Red Sauce, my buddy went with the Chicken Marsala, and we split a Dolce Diavolo pizza.    Before we even get to the food, I would like to give some props to all the employees that work here.  I have always had great service, and they always remember who you are.  There is a guy named Sean (not sure on the spelling of his name) who is flat out awesome!  He is always very personable and we always shoot the shit for a few minutes whenever I am in there.  He recognizes me every time I come in and asks how I have been etc.  Great, great, great customer service!  All the other servers are great too.  Even had a chance to meet the owner, Justin, and we talked NY Giants football for a minute.  They have a great group of people working here!   On to the food................  Linguini and Clams in Red Sauce-  Like I said earlier, I had been eyeing this one for awhile now.  Problem is, their pizza is so damn good, I never branched out to try anything else.  I had my mind made up though, and knew I was going to get it.  I was glad I did!  This pasta dish comes loaded with clams!  It had whole clams as well as diced/chopped clams.  This was piled on top of perfectly cooked linguini and mixed with a delicious red sauce/broth.  It also came with 2 triangular pieces of bread.  Man...this dish was fantastic!  Portion size was huge, the clams were awesome, and the red sauce had a bit of spice to it.  It was probably the best pasta dish I have ever had at a restaurant.  Yes, it was that good!  The kicker, it was only $11.00.  That is a steal for this dish!  I'm sad I never ordered it sooner.  I will order this from here on out!  My buddy said he loved his chicken marsala, too!  He was very impressed.  Dolce Diavolo Pizza-  This is my go to pizza.  I either go with a plain Margherita, or this one, 90% of the time.  This pizza has sopressata, Calabrian chiles, mozzarella, basil and honey!  This pizza is fantastic!  The combo of flavors are absolutely awesome.  You get the spicy sopressata, the creamy mozzarella, the heat from the chiles and the sweet from the honey.  This is all laid upon a great crust.  A little bit salty, a little bit soft, and a great chew.  It's a very unique pizza and its incredibly delicious.  It is also the only place in the Valley that I have contemplated ordering a second pizza once I was finished with my first.  I can put down pizza like nobodies business, but am usually content when its gone. I have never actually ordered another one, but always think about it..and only here!  The pizza is that good!   I don't know if I could have asked for a better meal!  The pasta and pizza combo was insanely awesome!  Out the door with tip and everything, it was less than $25.00.  For that quality of food, friendly service, and huge portions, it's an incredible bargain.  I can't say enough great things about this place. You should definitely check it out!",

They have two types of margherita pizza. My favorite pizza the Salvatore with the prosciutto di parma and basil. I was told by other sources that if you want bread, you must explicitly ask for it, or you will get none. Ask and ye shall receive. Another must order is the ravioli. We ordered the 4 cheese ravioli, but next time, we are eager to try the mushroom and garlic stuffed full moon ravioli. The sauces are full-bodied and so very tasty.",

Me and the Princess have been twice and the last time showed a nice little remodel on the place, new paint, tables, chairs, etc.  But since we didn't eat the furniture, let me tell you about the food, which was excellent.  Had an excellent dinner salad coupled with a pizza featuring Schrieners sausage-which is another success story- that sausage is fantastic and used by the best restaurants in Phoenix.  Had delightful service on both occasions and the food-to-value relationship was right on.  Great place to go on a Friday or Saturday and then stroll through antique shops in historic Glendale, AZ.",

They made major changes to the menu... No more meat lasagna, no more spaghetti and meatballs, and their bruschetta is now nothing more than pizza dough with a cup of diced tomatoes!  No lasagna or spaghetti??  You do know you're an Italian restaurant, right??  Then my wife ordered a piece of their delicious homemade cheesecake to go!  When we tried it later.... We swear it was Costco cheesecake, no where near what it used to be!  We asked our waitress about the changes, and she said the changes were made to make things easier for the kitchen staff.  All that says is... \"lets take shortcuts\"!  Well... It showed!  Needless to say, we're now in search of a new favorite Italian restaurant!  We won't be going back and won't be recommending this once awesome place to anyone we know!  Very disappointed!",

While it is a smaller space, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't too loud while we ate. They were out of the first 3 beverages we ordered, so we stuck with water. I didn't mind waiting for our pizza to arrive, but was very disappointed from my first to my last bite. The cheese on my pizza looked like white school glue and didn't taste much better. I put several dustings of salt and pepper on my pizza because it didn't taste like anything. My husband and I were so disappointed in our tasteless food that we won't be going back. I didn't mind that they were out of several beverages (I understand that it was a busy night), but there was almost no sauce on either of our pies.",

The chicken marsala was a bit salty for me, but was decent anyway. The wife had had a chicken and pasta dish which she enjoyed. My mother inlaw(Italian from jersey) actually loved the linguini and clam sauce.   Bottom line is great pizza and outstanding service by Michelle.",

When the food finally brought to the table, we had to go get the waitress to get salt, parmasan cheese and bread.  I had the Frutti de Mare with white sauce. It was supposed to come with clams, mussels, shrimp and calimari. There were 6 mussels, 4 shrimp, and the clams and calimari were chopped into fine pieces that could not be identified. I expected whole clams and pieces off calimari. My wife had the lasagna which was 2 slabs of meat loaf in between a couple layers of pasta. Not what she expected.  Bread is charged for and as I said, we had to chase the waitress down to get some.  Coke comes in a bottle so there is no refills without additional charge and it gets warm before dinner is finished. The food was just OK and not worth going through the traffic in downtown Glendale to get to. We won't be back.",

That being said I will start with the good, the pizza is Divine! I was looking forward to finishing my slice so I could enjoy that delicious crust it was amazing! I was born and raised in  Chicago and lived near Manhattan for a few years so I've had some good pizza, I won't say this was the best but its in the top 5 definitely. Now the bad, my friend and I took our kids to eat here and its a small place so we volunteered to sit on the patio on a night in December so our kids wouldn't bother anyone bc we are aware kids get antsy. Our waitress acted as if we were a huge bother and a waste of her time she was extremely slow and I actually had to go into the  building and ask for our check and a box when we were done. It was not a busy night either. We ordered calamari the Italian stallion and a pepperoni pizza for the kids. We were there for over an hour and a half for that amount of food again not very busy that night. I've already raved about the pizza but the calamari was very tough and 90 percent tentacles which isn't that big of a deal but still ya know? Anyway, I probably won't ever go again but I might have my parents pick me up an Italian stallion to go every once in a while.",

My heart is heavy. **cue woeful harminica**  Hubby, daughter and I embarked upon Piazza al Forno after watching triple D and seeing the menu online. We got there and were seated next to a large group that was incredibly loud. So not the restaurant's fault they were obnoxious. But, the waitress would talk to us in her \"inside voice\" which made her sound like Charlie Brown's teacher. Project, woman. Project!  The service was just so lacking. If you are clairvoyant, this is a good place for you. Those of us less gifted need not attend. She asked us if we were ready to order several times and saw we were clearly struggling to decide. Never offered menu info or a run down of specials. She didn't even offer a wine list! This week has sucked, so imagine my horror upon thinking this place was dry as no one ever alluded we could have a glass of wine or presented a list! Mama needed some wine. Help a sister out.   Our food came and we got the fried ravioli, baked spaghetti and the Italian Stallion. Nothing was even remotely worth writing home about. The baked spaghetti gave me the sense that they made a whole mess of spaghetti early in the day and threw it in the overn to heat it up when needed. Viola! Baked spaghetti!  When we appeared done she just brought us our check. Apparently, my brain waves caught on with their psychic vibe and told her we wanted to get out of dodge.  She never even asked us about dessert or brought back a menu. So, we went to Gelato Spot and I had triamisu flavored gelato. Done.   Wanted to love this place but it was so lackluster. So many places in the valley are better.",

The dough was very good, but that's what most of it was - dough. Very little filling, and it was if it had been thrown together and baked til the dough was crispy; the ricotta wasn't warm once I found it. My prosecco was very good. We shared a cannoli; husband liked it but I wasn't impressed. The shell was almost perfect but the filling was average with a very runny consistency.

When wegot there we waited about 2 minutes before being acknowledged then after finally being greeted we were shown to a table that was 2 seats and very close to another table with people. So I asked if there was anyway to move us to another table in which I pointed too. Only to be told \"oh umm if I sit you over there and a party of 3 or 4 come we will have to move you\". Being so perplexed by this answer my wife and I sat and stared at each other for a moment.    Then still wanting to give the restaurant a chance we ordered. We got stuffed shrimp and a Bianca pizza. Well the stuffed shrimp was fine I wouldn't order it twice. The pizza was also very bland and just not what we expected. Feeling a little dissatisfied with the whole experience we just left after that.",

Michelle (I think that was her name) was attentive and patient as we asked lots of questions.  Tried only one chianti and will need to try another one. I like a sharp, dry chianti.   Told they make the cheesecake. While I had enough room to share an appetizer, have a few slices of Italian bread, and my brick-sized serving of lasagna, I skipped dessert.

    "text": "Long term friends of mine saw this place on DDD and had been wanting to try it the next time they were in Phoenix without a family obligation. Well that opportunity happened when I was going in town and Saturday was the only day they had off.  My friends drove down from Camp Verde, picked me up from my Grandma's in Sun City and we embarked on Downtown Glendale. I hadn't been to this part of Glendale since I was still living in Phoenix almost 10 years ago now. It was crowded in the whole area when we arrived and at first I thought maybe it was the Farmer's Market, but then realized this was early February and this meant we were stuck in the Chocolate Fair crowd (also meaning not the best time to go to a place for lunch that had been on TV). Since I was technically on \"vacation\", waiting to eat at a place my friends were so excited about meant I could relax, but what was irritating is that the \"hostess\" advised to all who put their name down to stay within the direct vicinity of the restaurant as the entire party had to be together. It was a cold and windy afternoon and there was no waiting allowed inside. I did a quick peruse of the surrounding businesses and it seemed as if very few if any had changed. There are still a ton of antique stores, Haus (whatever the German restaurant that was also featured on DDD and other restaurants. It was actually nice to see the old timey feel was still in the neighborhood. After about a good 35 minute wait, we were shown in to our table.   The restaurant itself is small and it seemed as if the menu and service was going to be impressive. We all decided to try a couple of salads and a couple of pizzas. They chose one of each as did I. My girlfriend had a glass of Reisling and her husband had his 3rd choice of beer (they were out of the first two choices). I had icd tea and after asking twice for \"fake sugar\", pulled out my own Grandma stash. It wasn't until someone other than our server came around to refill my tea that Splenda was brought. Long time ago, I was a waitress so this alone tends to piss me off -hence mark off for customer service.   The salads ordered were the spinach and caprese. The spinach salad was pretty good but should have been tossed. The caprese was sad. Really really sad. We all know that February is not tomato season, but under ripe beefsteak tomatoes cannot be saved even with house made mozzerrella. For a \"foodie\" restaurant, this should not have been on the menu at all given the season.   The pizza's ordered were the Bianca and the Italian Stallion. I have been to Italy. I have had pizza in numerous places with ovens like these and though it was good, I was not blown away (sadly either were my friends). The Bianca was very mild in flavor and benefited from a splash of balsamic. The outer crust was good but the rest of the pizza was soggy on both-either because it needed to cook a bit longer or because something topping wise was too wet. Our server was friendly taking our order but we never saw her again until the end when she asked if we wanted dessert.   I loved spending time with my friends, wished the food was a bit more exciting and super happy that little old Downtown Glendale is popping!",

    "text": "So I really love the crust...really love the cheese...but this place needs to work on their customer service.  The first time we visited they wouldn't seat two of us at a four top until our other friends arrived.  We would have spent more $$ on some drinks, but even though they were not busy they wouldn't seat us.  The second time we had a better experience, but after moving tables to be father from the door (and cold air coming in b/c they wanted to leave it open) our original waitress who brought our drinks was upset and said...\"well now I can't help you\" because we were in a new area.  The third time, though, is the ultimate in tacky service.  Our night was great with awesome pizza....half of us coming from the E Valley for a get-together with out-of-town relatives.  It was great...until after we paid the bill...  As we sat there visiting and enjoying our night, drinking the wine and pop we had paid for, our waitress comes up and asks us to leave.  She said that we were sitting at the only 4 top...and that a wait list was forming.  As we walked out and I think \"Is this really happening?  Did I we just give her a 24% tip just to be asked to leave?\" I see another totally empty 4 top and only 2 people waiting to be seated.  Wow...for a place that claims to be straight from Italy, they should know that in Italy restaurant owners let their customers eat and talk and take as much time as you like.  I'd have to say that time number 3 was it for us...we'll go to Grimaldis, Pizzaria Bianco, or Spinatos the next time we want pizza.",

    "text": "The closest to authentic Italian cuisine in AZ.  La Piazza is a small Italian restaurant in downtown Glendale that serves dishes like you just hopped off the plane and landed in the old country. It's become very hard to find dishes (especially pizza) that are advertised as Italian, but when you get to the menu it is anything but that.  This place nailed it. Thin pizzas, fresh light sauce, bit of cheese, basil, olive oil. Want meat? They have a meat lovers pizza with ACTUAL Italian meats. THIS is Italian pizza. You won't find any Supreme, Thai, Thick Crust, or Hawaiian pizzas here. This place is exactly what they say they are, an ITALIAN restaurant. Pastas are great, staff is always fantastic, and they've even found a way to accommodate the influx of people they get by creating a enclosed outside area during the summer. If anyone wants to know what Italian pizza is like, this is place to go to.",

    "text": "I'm sold & ready to go back.  I walk in as part of a party of four and was able to sample a few different items.  Truly, it was all beyond satisfying.  I tried the cheese ravioli, bruschetta, chicken pesto lasagna & of course i forgot the name of the last dish; it was a pizza with prosciutto.  There were a few hiccups with the dining experience.  Nothing too terrible, just take it into account before you show up.  Not everything on the menu is always available.  Yes, they ran out of a few items, must have been our fault for getting there toward the end of their hours.  So we didn't get to try the baked spaghetti, but the cheese ravioli was AH-MAZING!  Also, the only dessert they had was cheesecake.  I have nothing, NOTHING, against cheese cake, but I really wanted to try the cannoli & another at my table asked about the tiramisu.  That was when we found out we came when the pastry chef was on vacation.  Maybe next time.  + They serve some beer & wine, not a full bar though, so selection is limited. ++ They also serve Mexican coke (different flavor from American coke). - Only had lemon Italian soda that day, & they are small bottles but the same price as the 1ltr coke.   Let me also say this: They are usually busy, so a line out of the door to get in is probably common.  This does make it a bit difficult to flag someone down when you need something.  Good things all around and I do recommend you try it.  During the winter there is a beautiful view of Glendale Glitters across the street.   (BTW, They have a semi-enclosed outdoor dining area. \"Al Fresco\" anyone?)",

Went for lunch, restaurant not crowded, but service was almost nonexistent.  Our waiter was pleasant enough, but lunch took two hours.  It seemed like we spent a crazy amount of time trying to flag him down.  He would go to the table next to ours and never even give us a sideways glance.  It got to be quite annoying after having to get up several times to try to speed the process along.  We all felt ridiculous waving our arms around and not being noticed.  I don't feel like one should ever have to wave their arms or leave their seat when paying $15 (per person) for lunch.    When it came to our check - he told us he would \"get in an extreme amount of trouble\" if he separated the check for us or split the bill 3-ways on credit cards.  We eventually scraped it together, but was reflected in the tip.    This is probably the third or fourth time I've gone here.  There's normally a large time lapse in between - now I remember why.  It will probably be a long time, if ever, that we go back.    Note to the owners/staff - you can't live forever on the \"we were on TV\" thing.  At some point, the service is going to have to pick it up a notch.",

We split a delicious cannoli for dessert.  The staff were very helpful esp with bae's 100 questions. The other down side was that our waitress forgot the focaccia I ordered... but I didn't remind her because I was so full from the pasta, which means portion sizes were great!",

I decided to treat my mom to lunch and we had the Italian Stallion pizza and a pizza Bianca with mushrooms and speck.  I like the thin crust with the slight char on the edges, the perfect amount of crunch and chewiness.  Great pizza overall.  We shared a slice of cheesecake which was very delicious.  Service was pretty decent, but I wish they would have included the tax on the written receipt (not that I'm necessarily hurting for the missing $4.64 in taxes, but I like to know what I'm paying for).  We happened to notice that our server seemed to be slightly exasperated, but when we looked around at her, she managed to perk up on the way to our table to serve us.  There was an older woman wearing an apron who came out from the kitchen area to greet the tables - except for ours.  It seems like she made it a point to act as if we weren't in the restaurant.",

    "text": "We've paid numerous visits to La Piazza al Forno and have always been satisfied with the quality of their pizza. Their Regina Margherita D.O.C., Salvatore, and Dolce Diavolo are all excellent pies, with high quality ingredients and a nice, charred and bubbly crust that's full of flavor.    Their appetizers, including their fried meatballs and ravioli are also worth mentioning. I also like that they offer the giant coke (Medio Litro) bottles in contrast to the standard-sized ones that most places have.  The place seems to be very popular for the area and service has always been good. So, why not a perfect five stars, you ask?  There's massive inconsistency with their bread policy. We always like to start off with some house made bread and olive oil as an appetizer. They have it and it's actually very good. Although whether or not they let you have it seems to vary based on the server. One server refused, claiming it was only for people who ordered pasta. So, even though we're ordering multiple pizzas, we're not allowed to have any bread beforehand? Interestingly enough, another server gave us some without any fuss. On another visit, the server refused due to the pasta-only policy, but then was kind enough to smuggle some out to it after she felt bad. Personally, since we're paying for the bread, I don't see why this would ever be an issue.  The only other gripe is that their housemade dessert menu isn't really all that impressive. They need that \"killer dish\" that everyone recommends, but I've yet to discover it. Strangely enough, their sister restaurant (La Piazza Phx) offers a dessert menu that features an absolutely amazing Angioletti Con Nutella that I wish they'd considering adding to their Glendale menu.  These gripes aside, I still highly recommend their pizza!",

    "text": "Unfortunately, this Italian restaurant was one of those long time bookmarks that failed to work out. We were here on a late Saturday afternoon looking to grab a late lunch/early dinner. The restaurant was dim lit, compact, with a cramped seating arrangement and enclosed kitchen. There was a nice crowd on hand that contributed to a festive, family-oriented atmosphere.   We followed the reviewers' advice and asked for their complimentary bread, but were charged for it anyway. The Focaccia ($5) was not really focaccia by conventional wisdom. Rather, it was their pizza crust sliced into wedges served with a marinara sauce. The sauce was excellence and had great balance with thickness and rich flavors. The pizza crust was good too, but I wished the server would tell us in advance that the rest of our meal would be served with the same bread.   The Mussels and Calamari Fra Diavalo ($12) was the highlight of the meal. The size of the seafood was not particularly striking, but the spicy red sauce was phenomenal. It was served with the same focaccia bread. The bread was too frail to pick up the sauce, but in this case the soft chew was both pleasant and addictive.  The Margherita D.O.C. ($11) arrived with house made mozzarella, olive oil, basil, and tomatoes. In this instance, I was looking for a good crust that encompassed a crisp texture, and upon biting into it, was able to turn into a good flavorful chew. However, the pizza initially arrived completely burnt at the bottom, a sign that there was a lack of quality control when the food left the kitchen. The server was able to take it back, but didn't appear apologetic. Some reviewers also wrote about the burnt crust, so perhaps it is a practice that has been normalized for some time. Still, it was unacceptable to us.   The new pizza still had the same soft frail crust, except it was very soggy and over-salted. It was a very wet pizza from top to bottom. The server explained that it was a result of their house made mozzarella. Had we learned about this problem, we would not have come here in the first place. We only ate half of the pie and took the rest home. The taste of the crust was too repetitive for us to fully enjoy it at this point in the meal.  Their client-based wasn't diverse, and the servers seemed friendlier and at ease with the other customers we were surrounded with. We left disappointed from beginning to end. We will not be coming back.",

La Piazza joins the ranks of Matt's Big Breakfast and Pizzeria Bianco as being the only places, that I can recall, where there was a wait to get in!  No, correct that, THIS is the only place I can recall, in the US, where I've been to that there was a crowd waiting to get in before store hours began.  Correction, again: La Piazza and Todai (in Schaumburg, IL) are the only two places I've visited, here in the US, that I can recall that had a line of people waiting to get in, in my last 20 years of life thus far.  I can't claim that I've lined up at Matt's or at Pizzeria Bianco before they opened for business...  What a cute place!  Really liked the atmosphere here (wine cabinet, murals, brick walls, etc.), and the staff seemed to enjoy their jobs.  Well, most of them did, anyway...  But why don't we just get straight to the food?!  Hmm?  I ordered the La Piazza Bianco <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q?select=Oadu8QvsrHJU-4PMfLTjYw#Oadu8QvsrHJU-4PMfLTjYw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/-Dnh...</a>, which is comprised of ricotta, fresh mozzarella and basil, garlic, and garlic butter sauce.  The cheeses looked so beautiful and exquisite (!), but the pizza came out charred in so many places.  Unfortunately, there wasn't a hint of crispiness to its crust ANYWHERE, and this is no exaggeration.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q?select=fV3E74fisRXUvjU85CalOQ#fV3E74fisRXUvjU85CalOQ  The pizzaiolo's excuses for the lack of crispiness were that the fresh garlic sauce and homemade cheeses caused the crust to be more soggy than his other pizza varieties, and bec. the restaurant just opened, so that the brick oven was not hot enough.  His mother offered to have another pizza done, as she didn't want to see anyone dissatisfied.  I asked if perhaps rolling the crust a little thinner would be possible.  The second pizza was clearly much better... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q?select=sbGKg7yJwLmX4wlhWsEJRQ#sbGKg7yJwLmX4wlhWsEJRQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/-Dnh...</a>  Loved the thinner crust, and the crust's edges on this one were crispy!  (The butter garlic sauce caused the main areas to be soggy, but at least there were crispy areas.)   I wish I could've videotaped handling the slice of pizza of the first one... it folded without the slightest crunch or flakiness.  If you're a crispy thin-crust lover, I suggest you specify this before ordering from here.  While my beef was due to the sogginess of the pizza crust (I didn't even mention the burnt areas- I didn't think there was any need to!), the ingredients, however, were of high quality!  I was so disappointed that the matriarch took the remaining slices away- I only had about one and half slices' worth of toppings to enjoy :'(  Most places I've been to that offered to correct grievances left the original items on the table, gratis.  She did, however, offer complimentary dessert.  Their cheesecake is fantastic!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q?select=dUlITiNdAY5kue075cevJQ#dUlITiNdAY5kue075cevJQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/-Dnh...</a>",

I explained to him that I needed a cheese pizza for the twins, he offered a Margherita, I told him no basil.  If my little boy sees any green on his food he will not eat it.  Yes, it is a new phase, which shall pass.  We had the Salvatore.  The crust was delicious, perfect amount of chewiness and crispiness. The prosciutto was great.  The twins ate most of their cheese pizza, which is a bonus it did not end up on the floor.  If we are in Glendale, we will stop by again.",

This restaurant was recommended to me by someone with roots in NY.  My tastes in Italian food go back to my roots.  The food here hits a home run in my book.  The staff point out that it's not NY Italian, but Neapolitan cooking, but NY Italian has its roots there so effectively they are the same or very close.  I had the lasagna.  A large portion, with plenty of meat and a great sauce with the right tartness.  One taste of this sauce and I knew the pizza will be good. Delicioso!  The dinner salad was fine, but nothing special.  Good selection of Italian beer.  The prices are very reasonable as well ($10 for lasagna is cheap compared to restaurants where I live).  Decor is basic.       I will definitely return and can't wait to try other items on the menu.  In the land of chain restaurants that dominate most cities, it is great to find a local place.",

We enjoyed our meal but the whole group nearly walked out when we saw on the menu that they do not split bills - one bill per table.  We discussed this with our server but she only would agree to two equally split bills.  The four of us were on a business trip, the company covers our meals if we use the company credit card.  Only two of us had any cash.  Anyway, we each teamed up to pay for one coworker's bill, knowing we would have trouble getting our company to reimburse us.   It was a real downer that ruined what should have been a nice lunch.  We could have sat at separate tables to get around this silly and unfriendly policy, but that would be like adding insult to injury.",

There were so many things we wanted to try; we decided to forgo the appetizer, and get two pizzas as our appetizer. We did the Italian Stallion and the Veggie, both were delicious!

Because after coming here, this place should have a line out the door 24/7!  We ordered The Italian Stallion, stuff shrimp, and the brushsetta.  The bruschetta was great, the ingredients wasn't from a can and simply top on a piece of toast.  My wife and I both reallyI like the stuff shrimp, it was seasoned just right.  Next time we come here, we made the decision to get the shrimp over the bruschetta for the simply fact that it was just a great dish overall.  NOW FOR THE STAR OF THE SHOW, THE MIGHTY ITALIAN STALLION! This have got to be the best pizza I ever had.  It wasn't very heavy on the sauce and piled high to where you can't even lift the damn thing!  The amazing taste of the dough from the wood fire grill is what really bring this thing all together!  I saw other pizzas that came out that I added on my list to try next time, but this one will be hard to give up if given the opportunity again.  The sauce and the selections of meats topped on the amazing charred thin crust....You got to try it!  The menu and cost wasn't that bad, about on average as what you'd pay for a premium pizza.  I found great value you in this place and would come here often for that reason.  The atmosphere here isn't that bad.  Cozy is what I probably say, not a huge place, but not small either.  The seating was comfortable and thats all that matters to me.  The customer service was overall good.  Our server was helpful with some suggestions and very attentive to our needs and drinks.    This is located in historic or downtown Glendale.  Kind of a touristy area, lots of restaurants and bars near by.  So parking could be an issue during due to its right in the middle of all the attraction.    Overall....A MUST TRY!   If your in Phoenix area and looking for great pizza, look no further!",

The basil and added Calabrian Peppers really made it pop! That pizza was excellent! This really was the best tasting pizza I had in the valley.  I've been here many times and I can't give 5 stars because the last two times I was here the pizzas differed so I don't know if you or me will get a perfect one next time.

    "text": "Since this restaurant was on Diners, Dives, and Drive Ins (Food Network show), a friend and I decided to eat here. We started with the fried calamari, which wasn't too bad. I've had worse in Austin, TX. The fried calamari's consistency of the batter was just right, but could've used less salt.   I ordered the frutti di mare with white sauce ($16), and it was okay. There were 6 mussels, about 4 plump shrimp, and lots of shelled clams. It was too salty though, so I stopped eating once I finished the pasta. The dish was unbalanced in my opinion. I had plenty of seafood while my friend (who ordered the same thing) had plenty of pasta. I ended up giving him some of my seafood. I've definitely had better in Portland, OR, which is why I give two stars (Meh. I've experienced better).  You may wonder why I didn't order pizza, the highlight of the restaurant. I knew we would end up ordering pizza later, post game (was in town for US-Mexico soccer match this past week). So, I didn't want to have two meals in a row with pizza. Maybe I should have anyway, but oh well.  The restaurant doesn't have root beer, FYI. Service was not good. It took the waitress about 10 minutes just to bring water after being seated, and it took another 10 minutes to get the check. My stomach was upset shortly after eating the seafood pasta. So, I won't be back!",

    "text": "When I cheat I cheat at al Forno.  Save room, the cheesecake is special. Their homemade cheesecake is my ideal for New York style: rich, dense, smooth and creamy.    The one thing I would change is the soda.  They serve Mexican soda, the glass bottle gives it an old-time feel, but the Diet Coke was flat or weird.  Maybe it does not travel well... There can be a bit of a wait.  We sometimes kill time in the comic shop next-door.  It's always worth the wait.     Back to the positive... The service and the pizza have something in common.  Neither try to be fake.  Each pie is obviously hand crafted.  That is mostly good, but some people will be put off if they mistake symmetry with quality.  In the same way the staff bring a little NY attitude to downtown Glendale.  I felt right at home, but my family is full of smart alecks.  I enjoyed the staff and the pizza.",

    "text": "Listening to the music on La Piazza's web page might be a very good way to add a dimension to this review. See (and listen) here. ;-) <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lapiazzaalforno.com%2F&s=906ee35ff2e6a7637ac70c435546c3ba73358e594c58fd72afc2026e70234533\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lapiazzaalforno.com</a>  This jazzy tune delivered in Italian seems so consistent with the character of this place when we had dinner there. We loved it and we recommend it to others.  Great Yelp reviews aside, we were skeptical given we'd heard La Piazza was featured on the Food Network show \"Diners - Drive Ins - and Dives\" (aka DDD). Typically, anything with a DDD nod makes us run in the other direction.  Fortunately, we didn't like the DDD connection dissuade us.  It was a delightful experience all around to eat at La Piazza.  Even if we did have to wait in line for more than 45 minutes for a table.   Because while the perfectly charred and chewy crusted Neapolitan style pizza was very good indeed, there were so many other ingredients in the recipe resulting in this five star review for La Piazza.   From the owner's friendly and funny persona as he came out to call names (he could take his act on the road and get paid for it), to the top notch service that started out by thanking us for coming and for waiting for a table, to the really good food, to the ambiance, to the friendly retired member of New York's Finest and his wife we met who sat at the table set close enough to ours that it was as if we were sharing the same table, it was great eats and hospitality and company combined.    THE VIBE: That the night in question was so pleasant is also a testament to the owner and the family and others who make up the staff. Because this night was a fundraiser for the family of a young Glendale police officer who had been killed in the line of duty just a couple of weeks earlier.   The fallen officer's family was in the restaurant that night, as were a stream of other Glendale officers and firemen who came and went to pick up orders and pay their respects.  It's why the folks at the table next to us were there on that night, and us too.  In remembering this young man, there was community celebration at just the right level of being respectfully subdued that his family present embraced too.  It is the neighborhood place vibe of the restaurant, and an \"all people are welcome here\" audience that made La Piazza a wonderful place to be part of for that. People waiting in line and joining in the restaurant included folks of all ages, from seniors with walkers to infants in strollers to Vietnam war vets proudly wearing emblems of their service to people wearing Harley rider attire to people who seemed to be on their way home from the office to retirees who seemed to have come off the golf course and even a few tourists, like us, in the mix.  GREAT SERVICE: Even though the restaurant staff and kitchen were \"slammed\", they didn't miss a beat in being friendly and efficient with beverage and food orders taken and delivered in amazingly short order given the crowd.  Service staff from appearing to fill water glasses right after seating through taking the order, delivering the food and providing the check seemed genuinely happy to have customers there and it made us feel pretty happy to be there too.  (And to tip generously as well.)  FOOD - WINE - VALUE: Delicious food and a reasonably priced list short list of wines by the glass were also an excellent value. Two glasses of nice Aglianico PLUS a green salad, PLUS a delicious pizza topped with housemade mozzarella, arugula and parmesan PLUS a piece of housemade cheesecake and good (Italian roast?) coffee was just about $35.00 before tip.    The folks next to us said their chicken Marsala and the lasagna were both tasty too.  So more than only pizza here if you're inclined to eat something other than. (But really, with pizza this good, why would you?)   The cheesecake is worth special \"do not miss\" mention.  Our waitress shared the funny story that she liked the cheesecake so much she asked the owner's wife if she could have the recipe and was told \"Are you kidding?  I had to marry into the family to get the recipe.\"   ACCESSIBILITY:   Level in and all seating on one floor, although space can be tight there were people in the house using walkers and wheelchairs.  DRAWBACKS:  Parking is scarce in the area. Table spacing can be too tight for comfort. The waiting line can be long on nearly any night we're told, unless you're there by 5:00.    But the wait is worth it for sure.",

Its small, not fancy, simple just to sit, eat, and hangout.  I had the chicken pesto lasagna, full of flavors! Good portion that filled me up! There pizza was well made! Flavor flavor flavor!   Its not so loud at all possibly cuz we came 30mins before closing. So i would say at the time, noise level was peaceful.  I would highly recommend this to anyone. I gave 5 stars cuz of the great service and tasty food!",

The floor is like concrete and adds to the whole oven style pizza. The cooks are tossing the dough and using a brick style oven to create the pizzas. 5 star ambiance. However parking is challenging because its downtown Glendale.  Had the Margherita DOC with mushrooms and pepperoni. The pizza was incredible and truly one of the best pizzas you can buy. The oven cooked flavor on the crust was spectacular. I usually dont eat the pizza crust but this was good enough to eat.  The pizza is large enough for a man size appetite. 5 star pizza n 5 star location. The only reason i dont give it a perfect 5 stars was that they will not split checks. So if you go out for lunch or dinner at this place with friends, make sure you have cash on hand so you can divvy up the split.  It was a little embarrassing for one of my friends who did not bring cash... Yep that was me...",

Since I am VEGAN I always order the Marinara D.O.C. with San Marzano Tomatoes, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Garlic and Basil (I order extra basil). At $8 it's a bargain for an entree, but definitely not enough to share unless you order an appetizer and possibly a salad.   The shrimp appetizer looks delicious and smells great too! The shrimp is stuffed with Crab Meat, Sauteed in Olive Oil and Garlic served over toasted Italian Bread.  Carnivores will appreciate the Italian Stallion pizza which seems to be pretty popular.",

We never want to be those people that try and sit right near closing!! Walked up to the restaurant and was warmly greeted at the door, told them we would order and go with it but she asked us to sit, relax and enjoy ourselves! We were very impressed! Shawn our waiter never made us feel like they were about to close, told us to take our time and let him know when we were ready to order. We ordered the calamari appetizer, some wine and a beer. The calamari was awesome, tender and very flavorful. We ordered the Salvatore pizza for the both of us, and it came very quickly! Excellent high quality ingredients, perfect crust! We ate everything, were even offered desert even though they were now closed. Will definitely be back, excellent food and service!! Thanks Shawn",

Instead I ordered the Arribiata with the added mozz. It was good, but the two of us that ordered the Arrabiata with the added mozz were disappointed in the amount of mozz you get. Mine had no perceivable amount in it so I asked and was told that they forgot and took it back to add mozz or whatever. When it came back I did not see a difference. Was a little peeved but just ate it as it was. That aside, the Arrabiata was just OK. The others enjoyed their selections. I really like the bread/pizza dough wedges you get. Reminded me of garlic nann. Service was OK. Would have liked the drinks filled more often. If it was busy, the service would have been considered good. But they only had three tables with customers at them and two wait staff.  Will I go back? Yes, just to try the pizza and mozz. I think I just made a bad selection and did not know what to expect. So three stars for now until I return and they exonerate themselves. Hoping for a 5 star visit next time.",

We asked our server for suggestion, had a glass of wine, a beer, an Italian stallion pizza and the ravioli entree. The ravioli was amazing, and the pizza was great, the meat was a little salty, but as to be expected :-)  We will for sure be coming back and bringing guests as well!",

    "text": "This place was absolutely amazing. I ditched my 8th Grade promotion and came here with my dad on Thursday.We came in and we're seated within 10 seconds by a young girl no older than 10 (who we assumed to be the owners daughter) and our drink orders were taken right away. As soon as they returned with our drinks they took our main order. We had no idea what the menu said since a lot was in Italian, with some quick clarification from our amazing server, we settled on the Italian Stalion Pizza and the Chicken Pesto Lasagna (which we split both of.)They came out with lasagna first. It was delicious! It came served on a large platter, with a creamy pesto sauce lathered all over, we dipped many of our bites in the sauce on the plate. It was easily the best lasagna I've ever had! A must try. Then came the Italion Stalion, Rocky Balboa...jk. We saw the  pizza being put in to the the wood fired oven and was completely done in 2 minutes. It was an authentic thin crust pizza with a,nase of their own house - made tomato sauce and a small amount of there own creamy house made mozzarela, (the less cheese the better in my opinion. With American pizzas they pack on so much cheese you can barely taste the toppings. La Piazza found a perfect median. Enough cheese to easily taste and get satisfaction, but not overwelming) and then topped with a generous portion of 4 or 5 incredible italian meats. You could tell the meat was incredibly fresh as it was moist and packed with flavor. The best pizza I've ever had. We finished with a normal and chocolate can oil which sadly was only ok. I'd had much better. Next time we will go for the cheesecake. Overall it was hands down the best Italian you will find anywhere in Arizona! This is my new favorite restauaunt. It was relatively cheap as well! After the pizza, lasagna, canolies, and a 20% tip, we paid just under $40. We will definetly be back!",

Was trying to make a good impression.  when i got at the door at 6:45 would not seat me as my friends were 5 min or less away.  in the mean time 3 couples of 2 were seated.  it is easy to track my time as i had sent an email at 6:43 at 7:30.  They made us sit outside.  could not take name and come back which would of worked. At 7:30 the table sitting next to the window which was there before we were was getting their food.  Trust me it was a very slow night at the lights.  have been there and really crowded.  Eat at Pino's and i know would of been seated and allowed to wait for my friends. Around the block is Durants  which has  my phone number from previous times and making a reservation is not a problem.   and i have been seated and waited for others to join us.  Pauly's in Scottsdale is way better than La Piazza al Forno,  For dinner we went to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.littlesaigonaz.com&s=b200a8b30303d631acf3cbbe5ed58387a3a82d70e8f9d9bf62fe7fa9e22b4b3d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">littlesaigonaz.com</a> restraunt about 3 blocks away.

They close at 8:30 wkdays & 9:30 weekends. We happen to be in the area & showed up 10 mins before closing on a Sat night.  The place looked closed but when we walked in they sat us. Waiter was friendly but in a rush to take our order (understandable). 1/2 the tables had the chairs up on top already & there were more than 5 other tables still eating. They cleaned up the whole time during our meal...  I ordered the fried meatballs & a salad. Terrible flat over cooked meatballs with hard edges & no taste. Almost inedible The red sauce was good. My husband ordered the Chicken Marsala. He said it was very good. I wish I got the pizza but I always judge a good Italian Resturant by the meatballs. If they do that right they get a second visit from me! No desert because by then we were the last ones left. We paid & were gone before 10pm.  Probably not returning, failed the meatball test. 2,5 rating. Not horrible but not okay.",

The crust of the pizza was a perfect flavor.  I got the Margarita pizza and it was a little soggy in the middle but I think they might use canned tomatoes, but the tomatoes were still really good!  Fresh doesn't always mean better and tastier.  We got calamari and it was lightly battered which was different and very good.  The squid was very tender too.  There were also thick shreds of parmesan cheese on top.  I love parm cheese!  The lasagna had loads of meat, mostly sausage too.  It was lightly cheesed which I didn't think I would like because I love cheese.  It was still very good!  The linguine frutti di mare had tons of seafood as well.  The red sauce for it wasn't that flavorful though.  I wished I asked before we ordered because the pasta dish that was on DDD was the spaghetti pie, which was the special for the Friday I was there!  Darn it!  It looked so good when Guy Fieri was eating it.",

As other Yelpers mentioned, it is not served as the typical French bread with tomato topping, but rather as a plate of wood-fired flatbread slices with the topping on the side.  DELICIOUS.    We tried the Italian Stallion.  I'm sure this is one of their most popular dishes.  The perfectly cooked pie was LOADED with delicious meats.    I took a chocolate cannoli to-go, I'll update the review once I've tried it.    The service was also quite helpful and friendly.  The store wasn't terribly busy mid-week just after opening at 11AM.  My only complaint is the location which is in central Glendale, and not conveniently located.  Either way, the food was tasty enough that I'll be sure to trek back out again.",

The crust is nice and chewy but still has a nice crisp. The sauce had some tang to it.

    "text": "I Just stopped by on my way home for (1:30pm) lunch, I was riding my motorcycle and I was able to park right out front. I ordered the Mediterranean it has pesto and sun dried tomatoes, I added the sausage, It's a 11\" pizza. It came out in about 15 min. This pizza was excellent, the crust was perfect not sure if it's the Italian flour as I was told or the authentic wood fire oven. As with all thin crust wood fire pies the center is not crisp because of the ingredients I usually cut a slice off with knife and fork but after that you can pick it up and eat by hand. Yummy! My meal was $25 with an ice tea and a tip. So it's a little pricey for one person at lunch. But hey, I love pizza and old town Glendale. They have other meal choices and salads on the menu as well as some good sounding dessert. Enjoy as I did!",

You don't send a pizza out to the customer like that. The waitress offered to make another but thanks but no thanks. No consistency here anymore. Plus who runs out of diet soda? 45$ wasted today. I should have bought scratchers.",

    "text": "This review is based on the pop-up shop that rented out the restaurant on a Sunday, February 11th during the Glendale Chocolate Affair. We saw banners, a roll out \"Italian Chef\" sign and a menu posted in glass saying they were featured on diners and drive-ins so we decided to give the place a try. We walked in without anyone acknowledging us and headed for the patio. There were three clearly marked signs that  request guests ask for assistance in moving tables so we hunted someone down and asked. He looked confused and reluctantly came outside to help us move them. We pointed at the sign and he acted as if he'd never seen it before- we brushed it off as he must be new. We waited for another 5 minutes and no one came out to greet us with menus. I headed inside and asked if anyone would come out and they said you had to order inside at the window- thanks for letting us know now that it's been 10 minutes since our arrival? Much to our dismay, there is only four types of slices to choose from which is not what was advertised outside. We ordered anyways and felt extremely uncomfortable that the lady took our cards to the back to run the transactions- I don't think you should ever leave with a customer's card in your hand when it's a walk up ordering system? By this time, we are already disappointed in the experience and it only gets worse when our food was delivered. The pizza was straight out of the fridge cold! We took it back to the kid and he said it just came out of the oven. I wasn't going to eat it so I told him he can touch it and see for himself. He gets the ladies in the back and they continue to argue with us without touching the cold pizza. Everyone was extremely unprofessional the entire time and it tainted any experience we may have in the future at this establishment. At least while we were on our way out, they added a much smaller chalk board sign next to the large sign stating it was a pop up shop and pasted a white sheet over the menu that's posted outside. Hopefully, no one else was tricked that day!",

The rigatoni and four cheese ravioli had excellent sauce. We were extremely pleased with our dining experience and hope to return during our time in Phoenix.",

I ordered the Pizza Bianca, hubby ordered Regina Margherita & my mom got just the regular Margherita.  We were in Naples together exactly 1 year to the day that we ate here & had been craving pizza like that again so we had high hopes.  All the reviews said it was just like in Italy but after getting our pizza I had to beg to differ.  The sauce on my husband & my moms pizza was insanely sweet, the cheese was good & the texture of the crust was spot on but we couldn't get over the sweetness of the sauce. My pizza was the flop of the bunch, not a lot of flavor at all which I was expecting a nice garlic flavor but didn't really detect much of that, it was just a lot of chunks of ricotta.  My dad heard about this place & really wants to visit when he's in town but other than that I don't know if I'll be back.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to this place because of diners, drive-ins and dives. But apparently I shouldn't take advice from that show either since that guy over rates everything just so he can get it for free and gets paid to say stuff. The pizza was very mediocre and the price was very high. The crust had no flavor like the dough itself, the sauce was bland and too much of the sauce. The cheese doesn't even melt I even asked for extra cheese and they didn't even give me that but they sure didn't forget to charge it. How do you mess up pizza?! I've been to plenty of places that use wood fire grill's and brick oven and they don't taste burnt like this place did. It was not worth the money. There are literally a thousand places in Arizona to get good pizza and this is not one of them. I literally can't trust anyone that likes this place I can't give them the credibility I feel like they only like it because it was on TV and because it's fancy. They don't even tell you that they have bottled sodas ONLY. I've had better pizza for cheaper like the humble pie, the fired pie, red brick oven pizza, True food kitchen has great chicken sausage pizza and even Peter Piper Pizza. At least all those are worth the money. I was so disappointed. That's just the pizza itself, don't get me started on how rude the staff was. They literally just want your money, they don't care about you or what you want. I know my pizza and I can tell you this is horrible pizza and horrible service. I'm surprised they made it this far on pure luck. I give diners, drive ins & dives no credibility. So disappointed if I could give this place zero stars I would.",

    "text": "Wow! Wow! Wow!  We came in Friday night on a whim and I now credit this as the best decision we have made in years! The restaurant was pretty full but there was a table for two available so we were seated immediately. Sandy was our server and at first she seemed kind of brash but after chatting with her a bit we quickly realized she must have lived in Jersey at some point. She was an absolute delight, she answered all the questions I had, and quickly brought me wine.   My favorite moment of the evening was when I heard her ask the chef if they were out of lemons, he said \"No, why?\" She responded by handing him the dish he just put in the window with the response \"than take this back\" I loved that she was so attentive of the food coming out of the kitchen and asked the chefs to make it right before bringing it to the guests. We joked that she was a female Gordon Ramsey.   I ordered the caprese salad and James ordered the margarita pizza knowing I wanted a slice but did not want meat on my pizza. The pizza came out first and after one bite I didn't even care about my salad that hadn't arrived yet, I was in Pizza Heaven. James had the analogy of it melting in your mouth like cotton candy. Sandy walked by and asked where my salad was, then immediately went to the chefs and requested it ASAP. I didn't even care at that point, I was half way in to my first slice and nothing else mattered.   I had 2 pieces of pizza and we shared the caprese. The only complaint about the salad is there wasn't an equal amount of mozzarella and tomato.  The next morning we regretted not taking a pizza to go so we could have left overs for breakfast.   We'll be back sooner than later and will be requesting Sandy!",

First was late winter and I had, I think, was an Alfredo pasta dish but they have changed the menu around some and it may have been the Pesto.  In any case it was very good and I even had a second meal from it.  And it came with bread.  I decided at the time to hold off reviewing the place because they take pride in their pizzas and their oven, which had been replaced a couple of months prior.  Between my visits they got certified by an outfit in Italy for their pizzas.  This last time around I took advantage of a Yelp special luncheon of a Margherita pizza, side salad and an Italian soda.  I would have preferred iced tea, especially after I found out how tart the soda was, but being a fixed special menu I did not ask.  I liked the salad.  I liked the thin crust on the pizza.  Too bad I tasted char in every bite.  In spite of all the turn off signs on the front door (no split checks, no seating until entire party arrives) my apprehension was allayed as the service was friendly and efficient on both visits.  On my second visit Justin? made a round of the guests.  Pasta 4 Service 4 Pizza 2  I would go back again, just wouldn't order pizza.",

We were immediately met at the door by our waitress who seated us, and was very attentive throughout.  Nice job!  We started with the calamari and mussels which were the best I've had, bar none, and I've eaten a LOT of calamari.  Super tender with a slight crunch.  Not the least bit rubberyThe mussels in the dish were also good.  The tomato broth was nothing short of exquisite.  So good, I could've eaten it as a soup on it's own.  We moved on to the Salavator pizza.  Phenomenal.  Perfect crust with just the right amount of \"pull\" when biting it away from the piece, excellent mozzarella, good display of arugula, and the prosciutto was proportional, yet not overwhelming.  Spot on - on all accounts.  Wrapped things up with the wine cake.  Excellent.  A lot of favors in the perfect size serving.  I highly recommend it.  All in all, the menu was pretty diverse while not overdone.  There were many other pies that looked awesome, along with other dishes that looked really good.  First visit, so we had to go for the pie and the calamari, but that whet our appetites for the next visit which will come soon!",

    "text": "I noticed the reviews here were mixed...you either love it or hate it. I had passed this place long before Guy ever showed up and was pretty impressed with their menu. I just never had the chance to eat here because I'm either here in AZ or somewhere else.  Luckily, I was here in AZ and finally got to experience it. Went with a friend and we split the fried calamari and the Italian stallion between us. I had the chicken caesar salad and she had the spinach salad.  First off, hats off to them getting the calamari right - it wasn't over done and rubbery. WOO HOO! Lovely delicate blend of spices and a lovely batter that just left me completely satisfied.  Salads arrived as we were finishing up the calamari and the salads cost about 8 or 9 a plate and were absolutely delicious. My only complaint is that if you're charging that much for a salad, be a little more generous with the greens, ok? I love my salads and I was a bit bummed that there wasn't enough green on my plate.   Finally...that pizza...The Italian Stallion...holy mother of...oh baby. LOVED the dough. Loved the whole pizza. LOVE LOVE LOVED the fact that the sausage had a surprise kick of spice. It was gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous.  Our server kept the table stocked well with water - another bonus. She was attentive without being overly obnoxious and we never had to worry or wait for things. YAY!  Overall, what a wonderful experience...I definitely would come back and I can't wait to go back, too.",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying I have been in the service industry for the better part of 20 years. I understand how restaurants work as far as service, reservations, repeat customers, etc. I was so extremely disappointed in this place. Here's my story:   While looking for a centrally-located place for the fam to dine, we came across this pizza parlor and remembered seeing it on TV. On their website it states they take reservations for parties of 6 or more so I called to make a reservation. The gentleman that answered the phone took our name and phone number and then proceeded to let us know the rules: 1. They won't seat you until your entire party is there (not really understandable since they pushed tables together and could have easily separated them should our party not all show up) 2. They only hold the table for 10 minutes (kind of understandable since so many people flake out on reservations, but 10 min is a little short, especially if there's traffic) and 3. We had 1.5 hours to eat because another party was coming in. He asked if #3 was an ok time-frame. I said it was up to his kitchen and how fast they can pump out the food - they did good.  He said there was only one table in the restaurant that could sit 6 or more.  However, when we arrived they were pushing tables together on the patio to accommodate a party of 6 and they had another large party just in side the patio and we sat in a different location, so not sure how he thought there was only 1 table for large parties.  Plus each table is a 2-top and can be combined with x number of other tables to accommodate - there was plenty of room inside the restaurant.  So after hanging up I already felt like they didn't really want us there. Four of the six of us arrived a slight bit early.  We introduced ourselves as the reservation and they promptly corrected us by saying they don't make reservations, they just hold the table and our table would be given away at 6:10 if the entire party was not here. Right at 6pm we called the other two who informed us they were 3.6 miles away (according to their GPS) but they still wouldn't seat us. We explained they were only 7 min away, but they said it didn't matter and asked us to wait outside in 100 degree weather sweating our a$$e$ off. They never offered water or anything to drink. Just literally shuffled us out the door and proceeded to ignore us for the next ~7 minutes. Sign #2 they didn't really want us there.   Since we were in 3 cars and not familiar with downtown Glendale, we decided to stick it out. The other two arrived and we were seated back by the bathrooms. Sign #3 they didn't really want us there.   The restaurant was not packed, nor did it get packed while we were there so I'm not sure why they couldn't seat us or even let us wait inside in the air conditioning. The ONLY reason this place rec'd 2 stars rather than the 1/4 I would have preferred to give it is because of our server, Sandy. She was AMAZING! We wanted wine so she made some suggestions for both red and white. The table took her up on all that she suggested. She was polite, timely, funny, professional; she just rocked. She saved the dinner for all of us. Thank you Sandy!   The food was fairly good. We ordered the fried ravioli (REALLY good) and bruschetta as apps. The salads came next (ok to split with someone - they are fairly good size). Definitely ask for the dressing on the side. We couldn't eat half of ours because it was absolutely drowning in dressing. The pizza was pretty good. Be careful of the pies that have garlic on them - they are large pieces of garlic so you definitely want to make sure your date likes garlic too. ;-)   We won't be back nor would we recommend this place to friends. We will tell them our story and let them make up their own mind. And we will definitely have them call ahead to see if Sandy is working because she really did save the night.",

The pizza wasn't bad, but it surely wasn't great. Not worth the line you have to wait in. Didn't live up to any hype and I've been to a few places that have been on Fieri's show. Hodad's in SD is phenominal. Pizzeria Luigi in SD is better than Al Forno. I've been to the best pizza joints in the country and Al Forno is average. I'd eat at Red Devil before I'd eat at Forno. Red Devil is my fav AZ pizza, not my favorite pizza joint in PHX though. I like Pizza by Napoli.",

    "text": "After watching Guy Fieri's Triple D for months, I am itching to go check out some of the places highlighted. Finally had a chance to do that when the BF asked if I wanted to go La Piazza. When we arrived in Glendale, I was surprised to see that it is such a tiny place, almost drowned by all the vacated shops around it.   We ordered their stuffed shrimp for appetizer and Italian Stallion pizza. I am not a big fan of shrimp unless it is very well grilled. This one comes with a good amount of crab meat and they sure are very well grilled. My only thumbs down for this dish is they over use olive oil, which got soaked up into the toasted bread. The Italian Stallion pizza is a mouthful of flavor. The base is just plain tomatoes, which gave the bread tomato-ey taste. The meat are very well spiced and the chef is very generous with it because the entire pizza is literally covered with all kinds of meat. The crust is thin and very fluffy with slight char from their brick-oven. Definitely one of the best crust I have had. We also got their chocolate cannoli for dessert. They have a rich filling with just the right amount of cheese flavor, some nuts for crunch and a hint of cinnamon.  The chocolate refers to the shell rather than the whole cannoli. It is big enough for two to share.  Overall, it was a very enjoyable lunch and the service was excellent. Our server was very attentive, making sure our drinks were refilled at the right time without having us ask for it. It has comfortable arrangements and good lighting for food photographers. I definitely recommend it if you're in town. If not, I still recommend at least going there once.",

    "text": "I'm sad to announce that after recently returning one two different occasions after a long absence, that and I have no idea what happened to this place.  First of all, the pizzas have gradually been shrinking for some time now, but now it's just not funny any longer. Sure, I had a good chuckle the first time, a slight smirk and a giggle the second time, the third time I may have grinned a little, but many times later.. now I'm just frowning. And who likes to frown?  And the quality seems to be inconsistent now. Don't get me wrong, I love a good char on my pizza, but there is a point where one receives too much char. The last order I received (during one of the few times they actually still accept and grace the plebes with pick-up orders), one pie was slightly undercooked and the other had an almost solid blackened crust on the bottom, which masked the taste of the toppings. Maybe if I had dined in and they were assured a tip, I would have received better a product? The slightly undercooked pizza was still very good and reminded me of how I once loved La Piazz', but both seemed to have skimped on ingredients from what I last remember.  I'll probably be back, though. Some day. Despite this escalated spousal abuse.",

There's not much more I can add that everyone else has already said. Parking is very convenient in the back. We had a waitress that was awesome! Dumb ME! I never asked for her name. But she was very nice and made us feel welcome! When we visited Texas a few years ago, my wife discovered baked spaghetti! Ever since then I have been on a mission to find another restaurant that offers it. Watching triple D, is how I found out La Piazza offers it!!! So we ordered their baked spaghetti, filetti pizza, coca cola light? and to end the night with their homemade cheesecake with caramel and chocolate! Wife enjoyed the baked spaghetti, it wasn't the best. But she would order it again. She think the baked spaghetti at Cheddar's is the best!! Their pizza was really good, I am a pizza sauce type of guy! But I have been really enjoying the authentic type of pizza. Their cheesecake was very good to cap off the night. Overall we had a great time and will come back again!!",

    "text": "Saw this joint on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and immediately jumped in the car to check it out.  Nestled in Old Town Glendale this is the place to go for great pizza in Arizona.  I'm mad at La Piazza because now I can't order pizza from anywhere without comparing it to this place.  I'm constantly haunted by this place because it's so freaking awesome!!  We ordered the shrimp appetizer and bruschetta, both of which were fresh, perfectly cooked, absolutely delicious and arrived quickly despite poor and confused service.  Then we ordered the Italian Stallion and White Pizza.  The Italian Stallion has several different meats on it, one of which I have never tasted anything like it.  I believe it is the fresh Italian supressetta and Proscuito that puts it over the top -- along with the pepperoni and sausage.  DELICIOUS!  The white pizza is basil, garlic, ricotta and mozzarella and while the combination is simple, the taste is very surprising in that the flavors are robust and fulfilling despite the lack of ingredients. The first time we went, both of us loved it.  The 2nd time, my wife was less impressed, however I am still a huge fan of this  joint!  Guy was right.  UPDATE: Went back and tried the baked spaghetti... eventhough we could tell is had been cooked much earlier and reheated, it was very good.  The red sauce is among the best I've had, a classic southern Italy recipe just like grandma used to make.  You can't go wrong with anything at this place... well, except maybe the service.  Let's just say that hiring within the family isn't always a great idea.",

The pizzas where actually really good if you like thin crust, we have tried 3 different kinds that night and have to say the \"Italian stallion\" and pesto was my favorites, one of my sisters in-law had chicken Marsala and I had to get a taste of that, my input on the chicken was that it had that \"out of the freezer\" taste.

These were perfect starters and both totally delicious.  We got the Italian Stallion and the Salvatore to share.  They were both delicious and I found myself wanting more.  My in-laws got the lasagna and the chicken marsala.  I was able to try both of these and they were also both delicious.  We got the plain cheesecake and the raspberry drizzled cheesecake as well as the cannoli.  They again were all divine.  The next day we all started discussing when we should go back.

Clams, Shrimp, Mussels & Calamari over linguini in a fantastic slightly spicy white sauce, (You can get marinara thrown in for a red sauce as well.) My wife had the \"Fettuccini Al Pesto\" with chicken.  Both were delicious and the portions were spot on!   We finished off with Cheese Cake drizzled with a raspberry reduction for me and a chocolate covered cannoli for my wife.  The whole experience was great! The food staff  were completely on top of things and very helpful with selections / suggestions.( Sean, U-da Man!) And my wallet didn't take a pounding either! Honestly we spent about half of what we would have for the same thing in Scottsdale! Truly mas bang for your buck here! We are most definitely coming back to try the pies!",

La Piazza is in the heart of Old Town Glendale which is a nice change since most eateries in the Phx Metro are in stucco strip malls nearby a Walmart or Target.  We ordered a bunch of different entrees and one appy.  We started with a bottle of wine which was ok but not italian and was also capped and not corked.  I can deal with the not having  italian wine at an italian pizza restaurant but please have corked wine.  We moved on to the stuffed shrimp.  It tasted semi fresh but was a little charred on top due to being in the oven I think a little too long.  The garlic olive oil topping on the shrimp was very pleasant though.  For our mains we shared.  We had a Salvatore, an Italian Stallion, Chicken Marsala, and the Mediterranean Ravioli.  Both pizzas were good, the crust was fresh and the ingredients were good also but it did not wow me in any way.  I love good prosciutto but the Salvatore prosciutto did not have much taste and the parmesan did not have a lot of bite either.  The Stallion was the star pizza with some very good meat toppings.  The other star for me was the Mediterranean Ravioli.  The Ravs seemed to be freshly made and had a very refreshing taste that was not heavy at all.  My friend almost licked his plate clean of the Chicken Marsala which I did not try.  Overall it was a very good meal and if there was a 3.5 star option I would have given it to La Pizza.  It stacks up to Bianco, and Cibo but falls just a tad bit short due to some beverage, and appy choices.  If you are in the downtown Glendale area I would definitely recommend checking this place out.",

Have tried all their specialty pizzas and have never been disappointed.  They were featured on food network's Diners Drive-ins and dives.  It is definitely not a dive but definitely worth the drive to Glendale if you are a pizza fan.",

Now I just wish it was a wee bit closer to our house.  You  walk in off Glendale Ave. and it's very comfortably decorated  with a clean Italian style. It reminded me of Pizza A Metro with more room , and decor.  There is a large brick oven in the front  that gives it an authentic flavor. All the servers were very nice and treated us like we have been going there forever. We ordered a  cheese pizza for my daughter and a \"Italian stallion \" pizza for us.  The crust was very nice chewy , with a light oven char that I really liked , a bit of tomato sauce , cheese and very different Italian sausage. Very tasty.   My daughter loved her pizza , she was thrilled , I was afraid it would be too upscale for her. But she was so enamored she about bit my husband hand off when he reached for a piece.   We are  anxious to try some of  the  other items , they brought a basil and cheese pizza by our table that smelled heavenly. we also saw some great pasta dishes at other tables.",

We went around 3:30pm since I am up at 4 am my dinner starts earlier than most. However the restaurant closes weekdays between 3pm and 5pm one thing that I didn't like. Oh well we window shopped in downtown Glendale and waited for them to reopen. When we returned at 5pm there was a line to get in. We were seated right away. Our waiter Michael was very friendly and told us of the specials. This night it was Spaghetti pie. He told us that they do not make the pie on a regular basis. It is made on a whim some days they have some they don't it is not on the menu. Let me just say YUMMMMMMMMY! It is HUGE! Spaghetti with bits of cheese throughout served with a very flavorful marinara sauce and it's delicious!   We had the veggie pizza as an appetizer and it was fantastic the crust was incredible. My friend had the Rigatoni Al Forno - Rigatoni noodles, grilled chicken, broccoli, sundried tomatoes, artichokes, garlic and olive oil topped with mozzarella!   Winner winner pasta dinner! If you have never eaten here go right now! Unless it's between 3pm and 5pm Monday through Friday. They are not always opened on Sundays either so call ahead. Also be aware that if there is more than one person at your table your food may come out seperately. They want you to get your food hot and fresh. So as soon as they have made it you get it.  I will definately return.",

    "text": "Yay I'm definitely a fan.  Its not quite as good as it gets but it is definitely one of the best pizza joints on the westside.  All their ingredients are fresh and great tasting.  The brick oven gives their pizza a very classic taste.  The staff is always friendly and helpful as well.  I've ventured off the pizza list a couple times and it wasn't necessarily a bad thing.  With that said I firmly believe the pizza is where its at.  The white pizza and the meat pizza are my two favorites.  If you are looking for bomb pizza on the westside look no further.  Update 10/9/12: I have been back on many occasions and have never had a bad pizza.  I can't recommend the spaghetti brick that is popular.  It's definitely not for me.  Bland and too much pasta.  And I also can't recommend the calamari.  But the antipasto salad is delicious and they make by FAR the best pizza on the west side of town.  It has always been great.  The white is still my favorite with the Italian Stallion a close second.  The service is always excellent as well.",

I arrived at noon and got seated right away. The waiter was attentive and had NO problems there either.   The pizza was delivered hot and quick to our table. We ordered a pie with Schrieners sausage and carmelized onions and it was VERY good! Now I am not saying it's the best I ever had, that will always go to Sunrise Pizza in Rye, NY...but I would put this certainly in the top 10 in AZ.  This is a very casual place and could probably use some updating on the decor, but the pizza is good and I would certainly make my way back here.",

    "text": "I dropped in here after hearing Sir Terry Pratchett speak the the Glendale Council Chambers.  I was a little wary of stopping in, since I had to be back at school in about an hour.  I know brick oven pizza isn't really the quickest meal, but I wasn't hating myself quite enough to stop for fast food on the way back up north.  I'd just heard too many good things about the place to not at least give it a try.  I ordered their white pizza (the idea of fresh mozzarella was too good to pass up) almost immediately upon sitting down.  I really lucked out too, because moments after I ordered, the lunch rush began.  Well, they staff behind the line are good because even with the flood beginning, my pizza came out in what seemed to be record time!  Sadly, after all I had heard about the place, the pizza itself fell flat.  The toppings were fine, the cheese was good, but it all tasted kind of bland.  I know, I know.  White pizza, not the paragon of flavor, but it still should have had SOME presence on palate.  I wonder if my expectations for the place were too high, considering I've seen lines outside this place sometimes (it's another Diners, Drive-In, and Dives star).  While I was glad I had tried it, I still felt like this was another place that was undeservedly hyped up.  I hear that the pasta is good there too, so maybe I'll give it another try in the future.  My trust in the Food Network, however, is definitely waning.",

The menu is full of many tasty sounding dishes and a couple across from us over heard our discussion of splitting pizzas and not agreeing on which ones. The advised us to get our own, the pizzas are a giant plate size and we agreed that leftovers wouldn't be awful to have.   I ordered the margarita added prosciutto, it was delicious but a little too salty- next time I'll skip the prosciutto or ask for less of it. The crust, sauce and cheese was amazing. Everyone loved the pizzas they got- two ate the entire thing and two of our had only two slices left.   I am looking forward to trying it again! Service was a bit spotty, but there was one waitress and three tables. She was definitely on top of her game, it seemed like that kitchen was running a bit slow.

    "text": "Saw this place on Check Please Arizona and decided to try it.  As a former New Yorker I am always looking for great pizza which is quite scarce in Arizona (sorry).  I ordered the Salvatore which has tomatoes, mozzarella, proscuitto (crudo), parmagiano cheese and fresh arugula.  WHAT???  WHAT??? I am still asking myself this after having eaten a slice of this pizza.  WHAT??  Did I die and go to pizza heaven?  Am I in New York without knowing it?  Am I dreaming that I am in Italy eating this amazing, amazing, incredible, delicious, pizza???  WHAT is happening here????  WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IS THAT THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST PIZZA I EVER ATE... THAT'S WHAT!   So let's give 5 friggen' stars for the PIZZA.  Ba da boom!  Nicely charred crust and fresh ingredients.  OMG, let me not reminisce.  We had a glass a Chianti for $8 which was a bit on the vinegary side.  Two stars for that.  Hubby had the pollo al something.  Chicken breast with peppers, onions, olives over pasta.  Sounds good right?  He said it was just OK.  Two stars for the pollo dish. He might have had better luck with the chicken marsala.   I made the mistake of flipping out when I saw zeppoles on the dessert menu. They are a staple of NY Italian street festivals so I ordered them.  One taste and I knew this was fried pizza dough.  The saltiness of the dough and the lack of a soft doughnut-like texture was a giveaway.  These were hard and dry.  Not greasy though. Not good.  Take it off the menu or don't call them zeppoles.  0 stars for the \"zeppoles\".  So what are we up to?  5 stars for the pizza, 2 stars for the wine, 2 stars for the chicken dish and \"0\" stars for the zeppole.  Let's do an average.  We have 9 divided by 4 equals 2.25.  But that doesn't capture the excellence of the pizza nor does it capture the excellence of the service provided by Karen.  So let's round it up to 4 stars---Thank you Karen and  you Mr. Pizza-maker whoever you are.  You made me a pizza that I will not soon forget.",

    "text": "The phrase \"Guy ate here\" seems to be popping up quite a bit around the Valley.  On the hunt for some great Italian food, it's no surprise that Guy Fieri, of the Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, found La Piazza Al Forno, one of downtown Glendale's independent eateries.  If you've never been to downtown Glendale, it has a certain untouched-by-progress charm that's worth seeking out. There are antique and gift shops, historic homes and a choice of interesting places to eat.  Owned by chef Justin Piazza, La Piazza is all about comfort Italian. The menu might be small but it packs a wallop, offering a range of pizzas, pasta and a handful of salads. I went hog wild because there were so many things that I wanted to try, and at their low prices I indulged.  Might as well start with something light, like the Spinach Salad ($8), which is covered in a warm bacon vinaigrette and topped with feta cheese. The spinach was super fresh, showing the commitment to the best and newly picked ingredients. Considering the meager cost of this huge salad shared by two hefty eaters there is some serious value to be had here.  Antipasti offerings are kept simple, with only a handful of choices, but one caught my eye. I was elated with each bite of Fried Ravioli ($8.50). Breaking through the crispy pasta revealed an inside filled with a molten cheesy heaven. This come with a side of tomato sauce for dipping and once you get started with these bad boys, it's hard to stop.  Based on the name alone, anything called Spaghetti Pie ($9) is worth ordering. So I was tickled when the massive slab of baked spaghetti resembling a brick was set onto the table. Spaghetti was layered with cheese and finished with a tomato sauce cream sauce that was so satisfying. The spaghetti pie was a daily special, but from other visits it's pretty normal to see it featured.  Their pizzas are baked in a wood-burning oven. Preparation takes only a few minutes and the intense heat slightly chars and crisps the pizzas. The Italian Stallion ($16), in all of its meaty goodness, is covered with fresh mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, prosciutto and sopressata. For some, all of this meat might sound excessive, but the distribution and amount create a balance of cheese, meat and crust, making each chewy bite a pleasure.  Guy Fieri has taste you can trust, proving himself once again with La Piazza al Forno. During peak dinner hours there will be a line out the door. If you want to avoid this, go for lunch the odds are you'll be seated right away.",

The extremely thin crusted, wood fired pizza that they serve up at La Piazza is a nice break from the everyday, run of the mill pizza pie.   I went in on a Wednesday night and had to wait about 40 minutes. This was my first trip to La Piazza, so I'm not sure if this is a regular occurrence. La Piazza was donating half of the proceeds the night I was there to the family of slain Glendale police officer Brad Jones. I think this may have been part of the reason of the long wait and think it was a great thing for them to do.   After seeing the Italian Stallion Pizza on Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives, I knew this was the pie for me. The pizza was definitely worth the wait. It had a great fresh taste to it and the quality ingredients used really stood out. The Stallion was topped with fresh mozzarella, pepperonis, salami, prosciutto, and Italian sausage.   Great food along with very friendly service gives La Piazza al Forno a perfect five star rating.",

We tried the caprese which rocked with homemade mozzarella, ordered a couple pizzas (stallion and Margherita)  and salads with a few beers!    Since its so good, expect it to be busy and surprised when its not busy, then you  plan for some slow service (hang out and talk with your dinner party for a change) due to the mass of pizza zombies waiting to whet their hunger with lovely wood fired pizza!  Will be back for sure!!!!!!!!",

Plain tables and chairs are not that comfortable. But the pizza is why you go there. It is very thin crust and they say they are Authentic and I believe it. The four of us split three pizzas and they were all so different. (the pizzas are 12\"). The Italian was the most eaten and the Bianca three of us liked.  We did have the calamari to start. It was NOT good. Very fried and overcooked. Very chewy and the marinara was so bland. We ate it because we were hungry. We had a piece of their cheesecake and that was amazing! DO get that!  Service was just ok. Never got bread even though we asked for it. We had to flag down our guy to order drinks. Asked to have the TV changed to a local basketball game but he never did it. He said he would but after asking twice we gave up.Lost stars for that.  The couple we were with were great and the conversation was good so we ended up having a good time.",

The hours were odd, we had to wait as they close from 3pm-5pm. There is a small patio on the street. The background music was pretty good rock n roll but personally I prefer ethnic music- at least Dean Martin crooning Vallare. We ordered an appetizer, mussels and calamari, cooked perfectly in (I think) white wine with a touch of marinara. The mussels were plump but light and the calamari was not rubbery. We ordered American beer- Budweiser, sorry, should have gotten a proper red wine, they have an excellent wine list, several Italian beirs, not a full bar but some mixed drinks available. The pizza was amazing! Prosciutto with mozzarella, marinara, red peppers and a shaved hard white cheese- not Parmesan. Wood fired pizza is the best! The crust is perfect! The ingredients are cooked as they should be. We ordered Zeppo for desert which was deep fried pizza dough in powdered sugar. Pizza dough has a lot of gluten- perfect for pizza- not zeppo! One should use cake flour- less gluten, lighter. This is a downtown Glendale gem! Enjoy",

We tried the Pizza Bianca (White Pie) with Ricotta, House Made Mozzarella, Garlic, Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Basil.

Our second pizza was the Salvatore with San Marzano Tomatoes, House Made Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Prosciutto di Parma (Crudo), Arugula, Shaved Parmesan.  This was excellent.   As for the pasta, we tried the Linguine and Clam Sauce, that's Clams in a Spicy White Sauce served over Linguine.  This was a great pasta dish.  Overall, good service, good food and will be back.",

Service was great even though the place was very crowded. I normally pass on dessert, but on a whim I asked what they had. When told that they had cheesecake and that it was homemade I went for that. The cheesecake was a perfect ending to the meal. Very smooth, very creamy, and absolutely delicious.",

We had the fried ravioli to start and it was good, not great but adequate. Our pizza was a different story. We ordered a buffalo mozzarella margherita pie and it was not good. Pizza that is done in a brick oven may have a little crisp around the edges and that is okay. Ours was burned on the bottom pretty badly. We thought it was just one area but as we ate it the whole thing was charred. Furthermore there was almost no mozzarella cheese. It was mostly sauce with a bit of cheese and a smidgen of basil.  The most disappointing part was when the bill was presented to us and my partner explained that the pizza was burned. She did so discreetly and off to the side. The waitress acted like she cared. We did not ask for the pizza to be taken off the bill but assumed it would be. It wasn't. There was no apology or any consideration for the poor quality of the pizza. Being that it was our first time there we thought perhaps they'd want to make amends and have us back. Doesn't seem so.  There's a lot of choices around town when it comes to pizza. I know we won't be returning to La Piazza al Forno.",

We got a sandwich, pizza, and caprese. Everything was great, but that sandwich was the best thing ever!   The mozzarella is handmade, and each dish is delicately designed with care. The food was delivered fast and in the correct order, appetizer, salad, meal.   With Sinatra playing overhead, I truly felt like I was transported to another time and place.

You couldn't be more right Lou. This pizza makes everything negative in the world slowly disappear as you ease into the perfection that is this perfectly cooked soft cheesy flavorful slice of heaven. In fact, this pizza tore the veil that allowed me to enter into the holy of holies of pizza. This pizza made it so I no longer have to fly to New York or Italy to experience such amazing pizza. Like Jesus gave me the ability to have an intimate relationship with God almighty, this pizza gave me a personal relationship with pizza like I've never had before. I will spread the good news, the gospel of this pizza far and wide. I already believe in the glory and goodness of God but this pizza is even more proof of his steadfast love for us. If you Gave this pizza place anything less than 5 stars it's because you don't deserve this blessing of a pizza.  This is pizza where it doesn't matter if the service is bad, or the place is old and run down.  But the service isn't bad, and it's nice inside.  How could you not give this pizza 5 stars? I pray for you to try this pizza, and I pray for you to consider giving this pizza 5 out of 5 stars, because this pizza deserves it.",

    "text": "Brought the family to this place to try out some authentic Italian food. But, it was a bit of a disappointment. Anyways on to the story of our adventure to La Piazza al Forno.  Arriving here for dinner with the family and was greeted by one of the  wait staff. She quickly seated us and our waitress arrived shortly after. We quickly ordered our drinks and was surprised to receive half liter bottles. I also ordered their stuffed shrimp appetizer and it was pretty good, with my only complaint of just getting 6 regular sized shrimp for $12. Didn't really see and valve in that dish.  Onto our order..... I had the Italian Stallion or their meat pie according their menu. I had high hopes for this pie, but was let down by the lack of flavor with the sausage. Considering there was a good amount on it, but it lacked the taste. But! The crust was pretty good along with the rest of the pizza. So it only gets a 3/5 stars. My wife ordered the Rigatoni La Forno and that dish alone killed this visit. It was tasteless and bland. Not sure what the cook was thinking when they were making this. How can the sauce be this bland and flavorless? Well, if you want a positive about the dish....the chicken tasted good. So this dish gets a 0/5 stars. Also my kids ordered the pepperoni pizza and they said it was good, but kids don't really have good taste buds anyways. So the pepperoni pizza gets a 4/5 stars according them.  I forgot to mention our server and her lack of service during our time there. Don't really like to be mean in these reviews, but sometimes it has to be mentioned. I think she only came to our table 2 times, once in the beginning to take our order and the second time to brings us our check. We went hunting for the chili flake, salt and pepper bottles.  So, I really doubt I'll be returning to dine again and will not be recommending it either.",

Ordered fried raviolis,eh ok have had better. For pizza had Italian stallion didn't care for their sausage not my type I'm use to on my pizza.

Since it was just the 2 of us we decided  to mske it a night of sharing. First, we shared the caprese it was delicious! The housemade mozzarella was perfectly complemented with the fresh tomatoes, as well as the fresh basil and roasted peppers! Fresh and delish. We each had a coke ( in the glass bottle, very sweet touch)   For our entree we also decided to share... a pizza bianco. It was perfectly cooked. The crust itself was flavorful from being fired in the brick oven. More housemade mozzarella & ricotta complemented with lots of garlic. Enough to ward off a vampire but not so much as to overpower the pizza as a whole. With just the perfect addition of fresh basil. Perfecto! We decided to share dessert as well but we were full so we took home a cannoli to have later. I have to confess, I  cannot resist a cannoli so it was a must, which was again delicious, a couple of hours later at home.  Next time I think we will splurge on the cheesecake our server recommended.  We throughly enjoyed our impromptu date night and cannot wait to go back to \"Piazza\". It really is a True gem in the heart of old Glendale",

    "text": "Blech.  Just blech.  I'm sorry, but I don't get all of the rave reviews.  This place serves almost nothing green.  What they do serve is huge piles of wheat in various forms topped with a little tomato in various forms and lots of white rubbery mozzarella.  Whether it's served in a bowl or in a pan, it's wheat and tomato.  The menu depressed me when my family sat down.  There's no way to integrate any vegetables into your evening unless you get the cliche dinner salad.  Your choices are fat pastas like linguine or rigatoni or massive amounts of bread flattened out on a pan.  Starch, starch, starch.  They don't have any capellini.  Spaghetti is the thinnest pasta they serve.    I finally broke down and ordered spaghetti so as to not make my family uncomfortable by not eating, the menu was so underwhelming.  When it arrived, there was barely any sauce on it.  They don't make the pasta fresh in-house, so I could've done better at home.  Definitely not worth the $12.  Then I asked for more sauce and the nice waitress brought it out and when I finally had a decent amount of sauce on my pasta I could finally taste it -- it was very, very SALTY.  Salt does not make up for lack of umami, but that seems to be the operating idea here.  We ordered the focaccia bread for the table.  It's their pizza without toppings.  It tasted like cardboard.  I love good thin-crust pizza.  This wasn't good.  It wasn't crisp and it wasn't buoyantly yummy or flavorful.  It was dull, lifeless and rubbery.  I don't know what else to say.  The menu is limited to fat pastas and tasteless flatbreads with some tomato on them.  Oh sure, there's a couple of other things, but this is the majority of what's on the plate here.  Neither the pasta nor the flat bread (aka pizza) tasted good.  The sauce was way too salty and the carbs were tasteless with a terrible texture.  Take a look at all of the posted photos.  What do you see?  Wheat and tomato - predominantly - over and over and over.  If you're going to do mainly that, wheat and tomato, you better make it exquisite.  Make the pasta homemade at least so it tastes fresh instead of giving it the role of edible holder for the tomato sauce.  Talk to the french about making good-tasting bread and then be the *best* at it... if that's the whole focus of your restaurant.  Our waitress was nice so I just bit my tongue and didn't say a word.  I would never eat here again.",

Although the pizza was terrific at that \"other\" restaurant in Heritage square, I had a pretty UNBELIEVABLE experience....I was with a date, we waited the 2+ hours, had a really good dinner, salad, an appetizer and pizza.  We decided we wanted another pizza and when we asked our server for another, we were told that we could not because there was a line of people waiting to get in.  I was amazed.  We left knowing we would NEVER go back.  I heard about La Piazza al Forno not long after that experience.....I truly believe things happen for a reason.  The pizza was even better and has been consistant ever since.  The service was very warm and friendly, literally like a family welcoming me into their home.  I learned that night, that it was one big family run business.  Oh and by the way, the best...did I say BEST pizza that I not only have had in AZ, but NY has nothing over them!  Icing on the cake, the prices are VERY reasonable! I GOTTA have a fix every 10 days! For the longest time I didn't want to tell anyone about my secret, however, they DESERVE to be known!

Service was non-existent as the waitresses appeared to be going through the motions and seemed to be pretty tired (no personality and acting like zombies).

    "text": "Being from the east coast I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to italian/american food and have been searching for decent fare in my half dozen years here in the valley.  You may ask what right does an irish guy have to be an italian food snob and a quick reply is I've lived in both boston and nyc and if there is anywhere better in the US to develop a taste for True italian/american in the us than these 2 cities well I'm listening ... made my first visit a couple of weeks ago to La Piazza al Forno and was simultaneously greatly pleased and slightly disappointed.  We went on a weekday afternoon and had the $10 pizza, salad and soda special as well as an order of meat lasagna.   Since I'm giving a strong review let me start with the negatives first.  The service was passable at best as there were only 2 other couples in the restaraunt and the waitresses seemed more concerned with rolling silverware and prepping for the night shift than filling the drinks of the patrons finishing their lunch.  Also I was hoping for some east coast style greasy heaven in the pizza not some \"gourmet\" fare with bland sauce and shitty toppings that fit better in a salad and this is not what I found. Yet instead of being dissappointed I was pleasantly surprised and decided to roll with the flavor and see where it lead.  The pizza although not what I was hoping for was still fantastic, light chewy crust from their imported brick oven and the homemade mozzarella definately made the pie unique.  Fresh tomato with bazil and oregano sprinkles gave it a hint of an east coast taste. Light and fluffy crust which I usually don't like in a pizza was counter-balanced by the freshness of the home-made sweetish sauce and again the mozzarella really shines through and makes this pizza far above the norm (exspecially for phoenix).  Although everyone talks about the pizza the lasagna to me was where the $ is at.  Getting the flat noodles of lasagna to come out el dente instead of soggy and wet was a surprise and was a reminder of home.  The meat blend of sausage and hamburger layered with ricotta tasted like something my italian ex's mom would make in her kitchen and the  homemade mozzarella again sealed the deal.  We didn't sample the wine but the list looked very reasonable.   Two solid meals and out the door for $25 (with a %20 tip despite the crappy service) will lead me back to try this spot again.",

That being said, anyone who says that this is the best pizza in the valley is out of their minds. While La Piazza is quite good, it has a long way to go to be in the same class as Pizzeria Bianco or Cibo.",

On top of the good reviews, the fact that DDD came to this restaurant convinced me. Who doesn't love Diners Drive ins and Dives? They make all the food look so scrumptious! I looked through the menu and decided on the Margherita with sausage added on. My boyfriend got the Italian Stallion. His friend got pasta. Even though there was only four other people in the restaurant the food took a good thirty plus minutes to arrive. As soon as I bit into the pizza I knew it wasn't the pizza for me. I thought the pizza would be great thin crust New York style pizza with lots of flavor. Wrong. Neapolitan officianado pizza? If that means flavorless burnt bread with plain sauce and little cheese than they definitely got it on the mark. I am pretty certain this is the worst pizza I have ever had. But if you're a Neapolitan style pizza lover go for it. I can't imagine how anyone likes this place. After I went I heard this place had huge hype after DDD but soon slowed down because no one ended up liking it! Wish I would've known that before treating my taste buds to trash.",

I literally could have filled a shot glass of grease with the amount that came off the slice.   The location was great, however during the summer time it seemed a little muggy within the restaurant.  The desserts were great, I had the tiramisu, but I probably wouldn't come back for the pizza.  I think the pizza is comparable to SAUCE but more pricey.",

We tried to make a reservation for twenty people they said they could not seat us in side but could seat us outside so we reluctantly agreed.  We thought this was really short sited but agreed to sit outside.  We started the ordering process hot outside and where informed they had no Diet Coke.  We said that's weird why would you not go to the grocery store to get some.  They said they couldn't that was not there policy.  I thought it was always policy to make your customer happy.  I must coke from a different background in which making a customer happy is the most important thing.  I decided to walk next door to get some fountain diet Cokes from Subway.  I brought them back over to twenty plus people waiting outside in the heat and where told I could not bring my drinks.   I would like to remind you we where sitting outside.  WOW!!!!!    I brought this to the managers attention it was here that did not want to take care of her customers.  The problem started with the top down.  They did not want my money I don't know why they would want yous.  Save your money throw it out your car window it will be money better spent.",

    "text": "OK, this is my first review. I went to La Piazza last night with family and was VERY disappointed. We shared the rigatoni al Forno. The sun dried tomatoes were tough and tart, maybe three artichoke hearts and a few pieces of under seasoned but tender chicken. The sauce was a mixture of pasta water and olive oil with little more. Now for the pizza. Since when does artisan style pizza have to be burnt? I've eaten at several \"in\" pizza places and the pie is nearly inedible. This was the case here as well. I liken the crust pita bread. We ordered the Verde, with lots of veggies but we added sausage. If the sausage had not been on the pizza I'm not sure it would have had eaten more than a few bites. The pizza was topped with fresh arugula, which I usually enjoy, but this time they unfortunately did not wash the greens. They were a bit sandy. Finally we ordered Zeppoli's. I was so hoping that the crispy, lightly sweet dessert would brighten our meal. It did not. Can you say golf ball? We sent them back asked for the check and promptly left. I will not go back.",

    "text": "La Piazza al Forno in Glendale is a great brick oven pizza spot in downtown Glendale. I will admit it was a bit difficult to find at first because my navigator sent me to a pizza place about half a block down the street at first and the sign for La Piazza is merely red lettering on the beige brick front.  Me and the fiancee arrived around 3:00 and were sat within 2 minutes. We were only delayed because they had to wipe a table down for us.  No less than 5 people greeted us when walked in which was nice. We had never been but felt very welcome.  We ordered the calamari (8.50), which was great with a nice garlic marinara for dipping. We also ordered the 14\" Italian Stallion Pie which is topped with Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Sausage, Pepperoni, Prosciutto di Parma, and Sopressata ($16). The two of us were able to eat about 75 percent of the pie (hooray, cold pizza left overs) and decided to save some room for some homemade dessert. Man we were glad we did. We ordered the Chocolate Cannoli ($3.50) which was delicious and different. Neither of us had ever had a chocolate cannoli in the past and if there wasn't about a half dozen other choices to try in the future it would be a definite order again in the future. The service was great and all the food was served extremely fast, even with the place full. All and all a great place and somewhere we will be visiting again in the future. It has to be the best pizza I have had in the Northwest valley.",

The crust was crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and the toppings were very fresh and flavorful. It wasn't as greasy at your typical pizza, which was nice. The food came out surprisingly fast for how busy it was, and our server was really nice. Only complaint I have is that we had to sit at the counter--which would have been fine but those bar stools are SOOOO uncomfortable! Aside from that we had a great experience.",

Well, in this case, a couple of visits for Saturday lunches proved that I was wrong - this is a small restaurant that creates big, wonderful flavor!    Over the course of two visits, we tried:  Pizze Bianca ($12) - certified Neapolitan pizza - oh yes!  The thin yet chewy crust was graced with homemade mozzarella, extra virgin olive oil, ricotta cheese, basil and plenty of fresh garlic.    Four Cheese Ravioli ($9) - this is a simple yet completely fantastic dish - three cheese ravioli is baked, topped with a red cream sauce and mozzarella.  You will definitely want to use some bread to enjoy all of the remaining sauce from this dish!  Panino ($7 + $1 additional for a slice of Proscuitto) - basically pizza crust-like bread with mozzarella, tomatoes and the additional proscuitto inside, served cold.  I was hoping for something more along the lines of the Schiacciata Romagnola served at Cibo.  While this was good, I wouldn't order it again.    Zeppolis ($4) - a very large portion of hot, puffy 'donut holes' sprinkled with powdered sugar.    No, there weren't any leftovers.  ;)",

The pizza was delicious, I would recommend everything that we got (the Italian Stallion, the Marinara, and the Salvatore).   The stallion was meaty (as you would expect) and the salvatore was a perfect balance of peppery arugula and creamy Prosciutto. The real surprise was the Marinara, so simply but so amazing. You would think that simple bread, tomatoes, olive oil and spices (no cheese) wouldn't be able to reach that level of awesomeness - but it can.   Also, their desert was jaw-dropping good. Our group shared cannolis, cheesecake and zeppolis (Italian donut with some kind of secret ingredient), all of which were in their best forms.   What would bring me back would be 1) the value (for the high quality everything was very reasonable) and 2) unlike most Italian restaurants, eating here with a milk allergy is a very pleasurable experience, my sister was able to get a awesome pizza (Marinara) and a terrific desert (zeppolis) without any hassle.",

You shouldn't have to keep asking for drink refills, beers, Parmesan cheese, peppers, bread and everything else when you pay for food. If they weren't so cold to deal with I was going to send the pizzas back to be heated up but I didn't dare take a chance.

Pasta sauces cooked to order, stone oven pizza made to perfection, and chill dining experience made this spot perfection.

    "text": "I'll be honest! We saw this place on food network, and like the lemmings we are, we made it a goal to come here. I arranged a table for 6 for my husband's birthday on April 13 to come here at around 6:30 pm. This restaurant is typically a first come, first serve place. They do \"call aheads\" though when your party is a group of 6 or more which gives you priority seating. (Hint: Gratuity will be automatically included in the bill with parties of 6 or more and they explain that to you on the phone).They were really nice on the phone when I called, and just as nice when we arrived at this restaurant. That alone wins big points for me! (I can't stand when a restaurant gets a special reputation from being on tv, and then they turn snooty). Here, the staff gave us such great service! Pizzas: The Italian Stallion - amazing if you love meat! Pizza Bianca - very good! Mediterranean - also very good! Um, I'm very convinced that any pizza you try here is really tasty and good! I suggest that each person orders a pizza for him/herself, because then you get to try a variety of pizzas and you might not have any left over because it's that good. Pizza sizes are bigger than the pizzas from Babbos Pizzeria but slightly smaller than/close to CPK pizzas (I guess b/c the heart of the pizza is on the thinner size, but the crust is still thicker but somewhat a bit flaky) .  I ordered the chicken marsala which I really enjoyed and because I shared pizza with everyone, I still had some left to take home.  Hmmm - I'm getting hungry talking about this place. Maybe we will go there tonight... or at least very soon...",

In those few years I will say this, I've been told so many other things aside from Pizza are delicious,  and I have no doubt in my mind... BUT when I make the special trip down here, it is for the BEST PIZZA I have EVER HAD in ARIZONA. Not over priced, the staff is awesome, desserts are great and each pizza has a recommended wine from their extensive yet quaint wine list. I'm from Pittsburgh, I've been to New York, family in Chicago and seen 80% of this country and still stand by saying this is the closest to genuine, authentic east coast Italian flavor - located in glendale, arizona. Bravo! 5/5 Mi Amore",

    "text": "I really vacillated between a 3 and 4 for this review.  I've been here before and loved what I had, but this visit was not so great.    Let's start with the moral of the story first:  never order something out that you make at home and love.  I find that I'm usually disappointed, and that was the case for this meal.  I ordered the chicken marsala.  The sauce was........not what I expected, and the chicken was very tough.  Fortunately for me the side dish is a heaping serving of spaghetti with a delicious red sauce, which I devoured.  My dining companions had the calzone and the lasagna, both of which looked good.   Don't come here and expect to be seated unless your whole group is with you.  I ended up standing outside (when it was 105) until my group got there, which was about 10 minutes later.  This would have been very acceptable if the restaurant had been swamped, but there were several open tables (4 or 5) when I got there, and also when we were seated.  Perhaps that colored my attitude because I really didn't enjoy what I ate and maybe we just got off on the wrong foot because of the seating.    Will I go back?  Possibly.",

First of all, when you only serve bottled or canned soft drinks so there are never free refills, that's just cheap! Then, to only serve a flavored tea that is so awful that you gladly pay 3 dollars for a 'no refills' soda is a little reprehensible.  Ordered pizza to share and two pasta dishes.   Pizza came out--had to ASK for two plates.  Pasta dishes were at the table before we had eaten a bite of the pizza.  Pasta dishes pretty much sat and got cold as we were sharing the pizza...guess appetizer is unknown in this place.  Had to ask for bread, lemon for tea, plates... Both pasta dishes were unremarkable.  Pizza wasn't bad but certainly not good enough to go back.  La Piazza al Forno went from Bucket List to Fu?&it List",

The restaurant is quaint and so cute, while the food is superb, very similar to Italy. I can only vouch for the Bianca pizza and boy was it yummy. In my opinion, a white pizza is hard to make perfect - and La Piazza al Forno did just that. The House made mozzarella, ricotta, extra virgin olive oil, fresh garlic, basil and the crust was heavenly - i couldn't stop eating it! And this was during lunch!! A white pizza is a great alternative to a red sauce.   I can honestly say I am excited to come back here and try more items on the menu. I just need to go with friends that are ready to chow down!!

Their coke is a 3$ 8oz glass bottle. Not worth it.  If I'm in the area I may come again but, I doubt it.",

This place doesn't look like much on the outside or inside but it serves legit Italian food. I loved the wood fired pizza. The crust and flavor is delectable on a level several notches above the average wood fired pizza place. I also sampled the cheese ravioli which surprisingly can be really lousy and bland elsewhere. Here the sauce was a tasty tomato cream sauce with sun dried tomato and fresh basil - very nice. Service was spot on, as was the price. I see delicious potential and possibility in the other untried menu items so I'm sure to return and update this review. 4 stars for you now though. Give this place a try!",

We entered the pizza place because all the raves we had been hearing about the pizza, to our diappointment we where greeted by the hostess, with \" we are out of Pizza\", how the heck do run out of pizza, this we said to one another. So we asked for a menu and sat down at the closest table to see what we might like to try, the stuff crab shrimp as an appetizer looked fantastic the couple next us had just received, so we decided to try it and a ceasar salad with grilled chicken.    Not but 5 min after we order the waitress comes back to say \" we are out of stuffed shrimp too!\", Holy cow what kind of joint are you running.  This is where it gets good, Danny- the gentleman next to us , offers of the last shrimp from their order and says\" don't worry we ordered THREE pizzas- we will share them with you, just order something else to try\" with that we ordered a meatball sub.   Thanks to Danny we had the cheese pizza- AMAZING,the vegitarean- ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, and the white pie-YUM YUM, as for the ceasar it was a 3 out of 5, the dressing needs some work but the grilled chicken was really great, and the meatball sub was just average.   We will definately go back , the pizzas' are FANTASTIC",

I secretly promised I would venture back to the area soon to visit Haus, but I soon recovered from my guilt when I tasted the Bruschette. Delicious. This place is really great! The pizza very tasty, we had the Stallion pizza - or the meat pizza. It was a little spicy and very meaty. So great. Also very inexpensive. (26 before tip for one pizza, one appetizer and two sodas, dinner for two). The sodas are also great - bottled coke products (1 liter bottles). Highly recommend. (We will be going back to Haus in the next week . . . and also back for pizza soon!)",

What is Italian about pita bread? Everyone knows pizza is based off its crust and this was not crispy even thou it was burnt. If I folded it in half it would have been a gyro. No pizza sauce and tasteless toppings. I just dont believe how people love this place, but then again Dominos is still in buisness. I guess its personal prefrence. I would have been more happy with a totinos for $1 or a microwave pizza. The pasta dish we got we felt the same way about, tasteless and just a few veggies and a few  pieses of chicken and agian no flavor. Well I think Guy was wrong about this one. If you want good pizza worth going out for its all about Pizza Bianco or Grimaldis.",

    "text": "I admit we went for the hype.  Guy Fieri of Food Networks Diners Drive In's and Dives visited the restaurant and the hubby and I were intrigued.  We live on the West Side and when hype comes this way we jump.  We went on a Saturday - had no problem parking.  Walked a little way to the restaurant was seated immediately.  We got a seat right next to the kitchen and got to see everything.   The joint itself is tiny.  The wood oven only allows one pizza @ a time and the oven as well.  The guys and gals behind the counter have this organized choreographed chaos going on.  It was busy the night we went they didn't stop for a second.  Hustle and bustle.  We ordered a capese salad (my fave), the baked spaghetti pie and two different pies.  It sounds like a lot but it soooo wasn't.  The caprese salad is missing for me a little balsamic vinegar to tie everything together.  It was good but not something I have to have when we go back.  The spaghetti pie was delish.  What makes this thing delish?  The star of the whole thing is the bits of mozz cheese.  They were hidden.  It's like getting the baby out of the king cake.  You find a bit of mozz and it was ooey and gooey.  BINGO!  The pies are ok.  We got the white pizza and the Italian Stallion.  The stallion is our prized pony here.  It was delicious.    We also got dessert.  We ordered a piece of cheesecake and a cannoli.  The cheesecake was very different.  It tasted like a souffle almost.  It was that delicate.  The cannoli was standard.    Before we left I went to the ladies room and outside of the facilities is a poster board with a bunch of pictures from when the tee vee show visited and the fun that they had.  My hubby was standing @ the door with our leftovers and my purse when I exited and told me that someone famous had just entered the restaurant and he couldn't remember his name all he said was they kept on calling him Al.  I didn't know what to expect surely my hubby would recognize Al Pacino!?!?!?  Turns out it was Al McCoy the voice of the Suns!  LOL.  He's a big fan and has a regular table.  There was a prom that night and his normal table was not available.  We gave him ours.",

Mediterranean (pesto, fresh mozzarella, and sun dried tomato)  2.  Bianco , (white pizza with garlic, basil, feta and mozzarella).    I love  wood fried pizza where it is soft  with just the right amount of crisp.  I tried a slice of the veggie from our friends but it was a little bland after eating the power punching flavor of the other two.  Also had a bite of the seafood pasta with red sauce, not too shabby either but this is a pizza place for sure.  This place is the perfect example of food done right.  When you combine fresh and really ripe ingredients with great cooking techniques you end up with a damn near perfect pizza.  The service was fine and the son who was featured on Triple D even came over to ask how our food was.  We will definitely be back for seconds.",

Being a server mysel,f i like that they won\"t split checks or seat groups until they have all arrived.Hello........it's a small restaraunt.they can't \"hold a table for your party and miss out on business just to wait for a group that may or may not show. also sometimes splitting checks is a nightmare if the people are old, and keep switching seats,ordering in intervals,and changing thier drinks everytime they order a new one.its very time consuming to split checks when the guests do things like that.also, with the limited space they have ,i think it's a good business decision. usually people who are so concerned about splitting checks are cheap,don't tip well,use coupons,and order the cheapest thing on the menu and drink only water anyway. if people are that concerned,they should bring cash and do the simple first grade math to figure out what they owe. anyway i highly reccomend this place.",

I must have made it at the perfect time, because there was not another soul in the place besides the staff and the friend I brought with me.   We had the Italian Stallion and I've never eaten a more delicious, scrumcious(if this isn't a word, it should be), amazing pizza in my years on this earth.   If it wasn't so far from home I would probably eat there every day until I started growing pizza from my ears.  I don't know what else to say besides, GRAZIE!! (According to google, this is Italian for Thank You)",

    "text": "The 4th place we have tried from DDD, and Guy has yet to steer us wrong. This little pizza place has great food for cheap! For lunch we had fried ravioli, 1 pizza, 1 coffee and 1 espresso for $25. The raviolis are huge, and come with a fresh marinara sauce that is delicious (I could eat it all by itself). Don't let your server take it away when you're done with the ravioli; have it with your pizza too!  The pizzas are about 10-12\"; perfect for 2 people. We got the Margarita DOC, which we thought was superb. The burnt bits stuck to the crust took a little getting used to, but didn't detract from the overall flavor of the pizza, which is killer with the homemade mozzarella! We decided to have coffee and espresso rather than dessert, and both were strong Italian blends to put hair on your chest. Our server was a really nice guy, as was everyone who worked there. It was not busy as other reviewers have mentioned, but that may have been due to the holidays. We will definitely be back here every time we are in the Phoenix area.",

They treated me like a queen.... Even brought me a DELISH slice of cake(on the house) and sang to me! We have tried several different items on the menu but I have to say, try the Mediterranean style pizza. Fantastico!!! They even have great wines and Brews as well..

    "text": "I was sorely disappointed by La Pizza Al Forno. For starters, there was a large line and the service was very slow. I know this is because of their popularity but you'd think that it would be due deserved and hence worth these fallbacks. There hours are a bit strange too. I'd imagine that if they were doing such good business that they'd want to be open as much as possible. They close daily from 3PM-5PM and close for the night at 8:30PM. They are also closed Sundays and Mondays. To further add to it, I was not given silverware nor napkins, ever, and my water was not refilled once. Every request seemed to be a problem and my waitress was extremely hard find.  Getting to the pizza...it was just alright but nowhere near what it is lauded to be. The crust was slightly, I won't say undercooked, but not crispy enough. I had the Mediterranean which is a creamy pesto sauce, mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes and feta cheese. I was debating between this and the classic Margarhetta but the waitress talked me out of it. She adamantly stated that it was better. I wish I had gotten the latter. The pizza was just underwhelming, nothing stood out and the flavors didn't pop at all, nothing really hit me and it was all sort of bland. You'd expect pesto to have a kick but it was as if it had almost no garlic. The cheese was generic tasting mozzarella and the feta didn't have a bite either. Even the sun dried tomatoes umph and I'm a huge fan of sun dried tomatoes.  I hate to be a downer but it was just okay, and when you claim to be one of the best, being just okay is actually a downfall. I would not go here again.  Unfortunately I think that they have fallen victim to their success. It just felt as if the staff weren't working well together and the place wasn't running smoothly. Maybe I was just there on a bad night, maybe not. They had trouble getting food out in a timely matter and pleasing the patrons. I believe that because of this they then send out less than par pizzas. There was a joint a block away that serves by the slice and I bet I would've been much more happy (and saved a few bucks) over there.  I have photos and a more in depth review on my personal blog.",

Well, not here it is not.  Found out that they often close mid-day to re-supply.  Wish I knew that before showing up with a hungry wife and daughter.  We waited around downtown for an hour with some cranky family, but once we got the food, it was well worth it.  We got the Italian Stallion Pizza, which was good, but if you don't really like lots of meat, I would stay away from it, it's quite loaded with meat, but still very tasty.  We also got a really good Pasta dish, nice combination of broccoli, chicken and penne with a light sauce.  The staff did as much as they could with the first rush (which we were part of) and often making sure my 2 year old got plenty of bread to keep her happy.  Since I have business meetings in downtown Glendale from time to time, I'm betting you will see me return, just well planned out on the timing next time.",

    "text": "Maybe 'Sandy' was having an off day or something, because according to her other reviews, she's amazing.  Tonight was probably some of the worst service I'd ever recieved.  I'm a firm believer that good service makes or breaks a restaurant. I'd rather eat mediocre food but have a great time and recieve great service.    We were peddled out the door into 110 degrees to wait for a table, not so bad if your from the heat, but for visitors, its absurdly hot.  We were sat after about a 10 minute wait, and didnt speak with our waitress Sandy for 15 minutes, and waited another 10 to even get out waters.  She was short with my friend and I and not very friendly.  We ordered the first pizza on the menu (can't remember the name) and it came out quickly.  It was delicious! I've been to Italy a few times, and it's very similar in quality.    I had a glass of wine and water with dinner, and was never asked if I'd like a refill on either, even though I left my glasses at the end of the table.  No one ever came to check on us to see if we needed anything else, and before we even finished eating our pizza, Sandy gave us our check.  I was apalled!  She didn't even ask if we'd like anything else or how dinner was (it was not very crowded). I turned the check away and said we'd like a canoli and she simply walked away and started serving another table.  No acknowledgement, nothing.  I thought to myself \"is this actually happening? Is our waitress completely ignoring us\".   Conoli was DELICIOUS! We wanted another one, but felt so unwelcomed that we couldn't wait to leave.    I will not be returning, thanks to Sandy.",

    "text": "Like many of the others on here, we first tried this place after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. It doesn't really seem to fit into any of those categories - definitely not a drive-in or dive, and I wouldn't classify it as a diner either - but it is a great find for non-chain Italian food.  Our first visit was with my husband's family. We ordered margherita and Itallian Stallion pizzas to share as starters, and both were very good. My BIL, who is something of a foodie, was quite excited about the use of San Marzano tomatoes.   My husband ordered the baked spaghetti dish that was featured on DDD. It was the one thing that was actually something of a disappointment - it was dry and plain, definitely not something to order again. I had the meat lasagne, which was quite good.  I noticed they also had a chicken pesto lasange on the menu. I was curious about it but not brave enough to order it. Fortunately for me, my SIL's finance, who happened to be sitting across from me, did order it. It was layers of pasta, chicken mixed with pesto, and alfredo sauce. It was beautiful.   I stole a bite. And then another, and another. It was so good that I made my husband take me back a few weeks later so that I could order it myself. And while I tend to prefer classics in their original form, it's now my favorite lasagne - definitely worth the trip for that dish alone.   During that visit, my husband ordered the Mediterranean Ravioli (which has an olive oil/balsamic sauce instead of a tomato sauce), and he was much happier with that dish.  Overall this is a great place. I wish we lived closer, because we'd be likely to visit more often.   One thing to note, though - it's literally across the street from the park/amphitheater in historic downtown Glendale, and during the weekends (any weekend, but especially when there are events happening in the park), it can be a long wait for a table. So if you're not inclined to wait, plan to visit for lunch or an early dinner.  Also, according to their website, they're closed on Sundays and Mondays, so plan accordingly.",

This is a small pizzeria Italian restaurant and it's amazing! They make everything in house. We had the fried calamari, which came out fast and was crisp. The marinara served with it was delicious and I could have eaten it with a spoon! We got a pizza that had spicy peppers, sopressetta, basil and was drizzled very lightly with honey. It was a red sauce pizza with homemade mozzarella and was spicy but not overly so. It had great flavor and was the perfect meal before going to a concert!  We don't get out to Glendale often but when we do we will return to this spot!  Our server was Sammy (I think) and she was great too!!",

Sandy was our waitress, she greeted us with a huge smile. And was helpful in picking out a pizza for my wife. I had the bam bam special. The pizza was sooooo good. I normally don't eat the crust because most crust is either too dry or too chewy. Their crust here was perfect. We are going to be back to try some of their other flavors.",

The Margheurita is also good. Lots of chewy mozzarella and very tasty sauce. Coke comes in a 500 ml glass bottle. The ingredients say sugar, not high fructose corn syrup. Would definitely go back for more!",

I almost couldn't eat the pizza because it was SO SALTY! Now don't get me wrong, I LIKE salt, but this was WAY over the top. The crust was soft in the middle because you could not pick up a slice. It was not due to an excessive amounts of toppings at all. We had 3 different pizzas in our group, and we all had the same issue with the soggy centers. The staff did not impress me either. It was not that busy, but the service seemed slow. I guess you could call the atmosphere there shabby chic, leaning on shabby.   I had several people all say this place was good,  but I'ld take a FiredPie, or a Mod Pizza over this anyday! Not only are they much cheaper,  but there MUCH better!",

Italian beer was pleasant..We ordered calamari and were surprised at the good size plate of fresh tasting squid..Spagetti pie was great...Pass on the focachia,too chewy to be pleasant.This restauranr was full, with standing line waiting.  no reservations for parties under 6..Noisy..reminded us of the good red sauce joints in Chicago..

Let me start by saying this place is way overrated and it became even worse after Guy Fieri's endorsement. The pizza's are very small and they are extremely stingy with the ingredients. The salads are an absolute joke. Everything is way overpriced. Brick oven Pizza should not mean jet black, burnt, charcoal tasting crust! This place has a lot of regulars that live very close to this place and they are receiving a far different experience than the occasional customer. If you want a great pie go to Pizza Bianca in Phoenix or Grimaldi in West Gate. If you want a heartier pie nothing beats Pullanos Pizza and wings.",

The wait is worth it though.  Try the white ricotta pizza and the meat pizza. Both are delicious and you won't leave hungry. The only reason why I didn't give this review 5 stars is because,  the restaurant is pretty small and tight so, you don't have a lot of wiggle room.",

I lived and worked in Naples for some years on the Italian hit soap opera Un Posto al Sole (a Place in the Sun). Much to our dismay we found this place to be dingy and unkept, and our table had scratch marks on it. The place could have used a paint job. Pizzerias in Naples may be small, but they are neat. This was 8 months back so maybe by now it's been improved. I can only speak of our experience at the time. The pizza was adequate but nothing to drive more than five miles for. If you happen to be in the area and want a pizza by all means stop in, otherwise go to Pizza Bianco, named one of the top ten pizzerias in the country.",

Pricey for little. - Ordered Regina Margherita D.O.C this was just awful. This thing looked like it fell on the floor. 3 faint cheese spots with 3 basil leave mostly on 1 side and a cherry tomato not a San Marzano like advertised. The sauce was bland and tasted like tomato soup concentrate. $14 very pricey   This with 2 glasses of wine costs me $60..Ouch.

Plenty of yummy cheese on the inside (Ricotta if not others as well), golden brown breading/crust, and thick shavings of fresh Parmesan garnished on top.  Marinara on the side.  Wow.  Pizza was good but not great.  Pleasant sweet tomato flavors and homemade cheese were good.  Crust wasn't what I thought a traditional Neapolitan was all about though.  It was thicker here, more like what most folks consider a NY style.  Didn't care for the $2.50 bottles of coke, without refills of course.  Service was friendly and overall very good.",

I hadn't heard of the place before, but when in the area, I drove by while wondering where to dine for lunch, pulled it up on Yelp to see its rating and how many reviews, and took a chance once I saw the 4 star rating, and 87 reviews!    I saw the panini on the lunch special (mozzarella, tomato, procsciutto), and ordered away.  It was delicious, so good!  Everything was fresh, high quality.  The service was good.  I'd love to go back again and again, but I do not live nearby, but if in the area again, I'll be back!",

When I asked the waitress she advised it was a discontinued  item.. I am highly disappointed by this statement.. We asked why, her response was, we want to be known  for our speciality, our pizza, not the baked spaghetti.   She stated that it was a  limited time only.. Now mind you, every table around us had at least three to four pizzas on them.. I think folks know you make pizza. Bring back the baked spaghetti and i will consider coming back to your restaurant.. Wood fired pizzas are every where... But the baked spaghetti was only found at your location. Maybe Lou Malnatis that is opening in our neighborhood after the first of the year will have it and my business... Your food is good, but....",

We entered La Piazza and plan to come back, even though it is in the West Valley!  We ordered a standard cheese pizza. There were 6 slices = 2 slices each! The cheese was wonderful and you could tell it was fresh and we over heard it was made daily! The sauce was not tangy but very rich in flavor. The crust was not hard but yet firm to hold the sauce and cheese.   We decided to get a slice of cheesecake and some Zeppolis which are dough type doughnuts sprinkled with powdered sugar! OMW that was WONDERFUL!  We arrived about 11:30, there were about 3-4 tables occupied. By the time we left at 12:20 there were 7 people waiting in line for a table! Now mind you this appears to be a typical lunch on a Wednesday!   Unfortunately they are small, and they only have about 12 tables. I am not sure this is a bad thing, it just makes people realize how good of a place it is and it's cozy.  We will definitely be back and hope that others try it when you are on Glendale Ave.!",

    "text": "STAY AWAY!!! My friends and I were very excited to try this place since we've heard they cook their pizza in a brick fired oven. We were seated quickly but waited at least 15 minutes before we could even order drinks. I knew it was going to be an awkward experience because our waitress had such a dry sense of humor  and it almost came off as being bitchy and rude. Our food took about 25-30 minutes to come out but we were patient (since we knew making fresh pizza wouldn't be a fast task) as hungry as we were no bread was brought out to us to hold us through until served, in fact it came out with our food. Ok, so a little slip up no biggy. Moving on, I ordered the raviolis and they were ice cold and had the texture of being microwaved. It literally look like barf on a plate. The waitress then brings out the pizzas and says, \"they're a little crispy let me know if it's too much for you.\" Well crispy is an understatement, the pizza crust was burnt as black as a tire and the bottom was so super soggy it was impossible to hold without everything falling off. Our first bite was horrific and we all looked at each other with the same facial expression, the pizza was incredibly salty as if they poured a whole cup of salt on it. My friend ordered the chicken pasta which was so bland and flavorless. She said, \"since I don't know how to cook I could have made this at home.\" Pasta seemed like it was cooked in a pot with a can of stewed tomatoes thrown on a plate with microwaved tough dry chicken with sauce that was like a watery soup. All these great reviews are either from people who don't know good food or are followers of the show \"Diner Drive ins and Dives\" and are just being super fans cause this place is a JOKE!!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS HORRIBLE PLACE, BAD FOOD AND BAD SERVICE!",

Then I enjoyed a seafood linguine although I can't remember the exact name of it. It was superb. My daughter had lasagna which was above average... Very good. And my friend had a chicken pesto lasagna which was very rich but extremely delicious. My youngest kids had a ricotta/pepperoni stuffed calzone and it was delicious.  We finished with Italian donuts -- (a solid five stars on those) and enjoyed \"Coke light\" and Pellegrino's with the kids.  It's my new favorite place in the West Valley.

The crust is very thin but maintains a perfect texture and taste; especially for not being greased up like most place's crusts are.  That being said, it is fairly expensive for what it is; my wife and I got pizza for dinner last night and I had 4 slices of the 6 and just barely felt satisfying.  I can only imagine how the three guys who ordered a single pizza behind us felt.  The chocolate cheesecake is pricey but delicious; I suppose the same could be said for the shrimp appetizer.    I consider this a place to take on a moderate night out, hardly everyday fare!  But it will be worth it!  Also, don't be afraid to head about 100 years east on Glendale Ave after to hitup drinks at the tiny place next to the Gaslight Inn!",

    "text": "So, my first review on Yelp. My wife and another couple were at La Piazza al Forno for pizza this past Friday evening, a place we've been to many times in the past. I will say this is the first time visiting since they installed a new pizza oven and received their \"Verace Pizza Napoletana\" certification.  Our pizza (the Bianca) wasn't particularly to our liking -- the crust was undercooked, thick, and doughy. Granted, we really should have said something right then and there, and asked for a replacement pizza. I chose instead to post a professional comment on their Facebook page, simply asking if perhaps they were having an off night. In a classic example of how *not* to use social media, they deleted my comment without response. Not the proper way to interact with your customers, especially since my wife and I have told countless friends about the (previously?) excellent pizza at the establishment.  It's doubtful that we'll return due to their unprofessionalism, which is a shame because we're big supporters of locally-owned, independent establishments.  Additional comment 9-Dec-11: Received a note from Justin indicating the Facebook comment delete was inadvertent, with an offer of a replacement pizza. Will post an update the next time we're in that area and try a second pizza.",

I don't need to eat a large portion. At the top of the menu it states focaccia bread is available \"on request\". In all my past visits I didn't need to \"request\" the delicious focaccia with oil and balsamic. Okay. I can submit my request for bread. But hold on here folks!

Now you are implying that I am too stupid to know the difference between pizza dough and focaccia. Smaller portions. Fail. Asking for something that was freely offered before? Fail.

I love wood fired pizza and 4. it wasn't far from our resort and 5. I am full blooded Italian and 6. I love Neapolitan pizza and 7. I love pizza (like crazy)...oops...already said that.. and 8.  I have eaten excessive amounts of pizza ...So, yeah I was brimming with excitement and very determined to get here..  While everyone was exhausted after the drive back from visiting the Grand Canyon and hadn't eaten anything for over 5 hours, we were both super hungry and super *car-lagged*.  It was pretty late and we wanted some fast eats. No dining in.  No fast food.  So I pleaded (& begged to my sister)  that she join me in grabbing some pizzas to bring back for all to eat.  It was only another 20 min. car drive anyway... We easily found it and happily arrived!  Placed our order to the very friendly & personable server and waited while listening to some good Italian jams (I might add).  The restaurant was cozy & wood oven was in clear sight. #Happiness ;)  Most (as I) ordered the Regina Margherita (san marzano tomatoes, bufalo mozzarella & fresh basil) and Salvatore (same as Margherita but w/prosciutto).  Got pizzas, arrived in suite, broke open the boxes and boy oh boy - Guy was not kidding around! (for a change).  While we didn't eat it piping hot from the oven (best way to eat this kind of pizza) it was still delicious.  Crust was somewhat chewy, had that 'pull' you'd expect, & nicely charred. Light, fresh sauce, and the bufalo cheese combined with basil.  This was music to my mouth.  Pretty outstanding. Kudos to Arizona (or Glendale) & La Piazza al Forno & Guy (for that matter) for this superb pizza!!!  So, the moral of this review is 1. I will beg for pizza 2. I will travel for pizza, 3. I am a pizza gluten, 4. I will continue to watch Triple D and 5. I will DEFINATELY be back the next time I am in Phoenix!!!!",

When we didn't find a Mexican restaurant, we saw La Piazza al Forno and decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad we did.  It was some of the best pizza and Italian food I've ever had.  Sandy was our server and she was a total sweetheart, and gave us amazing service.  We will definitely be coming back next time we're in Glendale.",

They do not have a kids menu, but did accommodate with making a small portion of some butter noodles. Coke comes in a glass bottle, which always tastes better! We had their Dolci Diavolo and Italian Stallion to eat. They both were delicious. They had a nice thin, crisp crust with a perfect chat. Best crust I've had on a pizza in a long time!",

I have been by in the past and know this place gets packed so we came in close to when they opened for dinner. We had no wait and were greeted and seated immediately.  It smelled amazing and made me even more hungry! Our server was super friendly and guided us when we asked for ideas on things to order. We started out with the Bruschetta which was amazing. I could have just eaten that and the bread for dinner. Delicious.  We decided to each order an entree and share. We had the Italian Stallion pizza, Pesto Lasagna and the Linguini and clams with white sauce. We all loved everything! The pizza was not the best I have had but it was definitely up there with the best. The Linguini and clams was really good with just enough spice to give it a nice kick at the end. My favorite was the lasagna. It was different and delicious. The creamy pesto sauce was so good I dipped my pizza crust into my bowl to get the last bit of sauce. The lasagna was made up of chicken and cheeses. We enjoyed beer and wine with our dinner and everything was priced appropriately for the portion size. Can't wait to return because I am going to crave that lasagna again very soon.",

First asked server for cheese pizza she said the closest thing was a margherita, five minutes after ordering looked up and noticed the pizza special was a 4 cheese,  didn't say anything about it.  Ok, got apps and set dirty plates on app plate.  When they took away our plates she brought our pizza but with no extra plates.  Waited 5 minutes to try to find her for more plates.  She sets them down and leaves.  Waited another couple to ask for a soda refill and cheese and peppers.  Each time she sets it down without a word.  Never asked if the food was good or if we needed anything.  And no, it was not busy.  Then we were over charged for the pizza and sodas.  She charged us $16 for 3 sodas!!!  Needless to say, save your money, you'll get better service from McDonald's.",

My lunch special was a hybrid pizza/calzone that was perfectly baked and came piping hot with the best crust in town and freshest basil I've tasted. I make great pizza but I can't compete with their knowledge and the beautiful imported oven that is the namesake of their restaurant.  Five star flavor in a tin star town.",

Antipasto was surprisingly good! Two minor observations and one major. Artichoke hearts were flavorless and the prosciutto di Parma was dry. The major complaint? Bread wasn't offered with the antipasto!! Horrors! The pizza was good. Would have been great if the sauce was thicker and applied a bit more liberally. We'll go again!",

Pizza supposedly the feature but a lot of patrons eating other dishes.   We had two different pizzas and a spaghetti & meatballs.  Regina pizza with added sausage was fine, although needed salt and was also pretty wet.  Tasty though. Wifey had a Bianca with added Gaeta olives...which turned out to NOT be Gaeta variety.  Having owned a fine dining Italian restaurant, I know my olives...and Gaetas are NOT green.  The server insisted they were but I let it slide as I wasn't in the mood to argue.   Kids spaghetti was very flavorful, and al dente.  The meatball to rather meat patty (it was flat) was fried, then had sauce dribbled on it, not cooked in the sauce.  Flavor was good but a bit chewy.    Service was OK.  I suspect the regulars get more attention, but that's not a surprise.  All in all, good if you're in the area but I wouldn't go far out of my way.   GB",

We felt rushed the whole time. We went for my husband's birthday and I told the waitress and there wasn't even a happy birthday said or a desert offered. We were going to order the cheesecake regardless but after that incident I just wanted to leave. We are from California and come once a year for baseball and to be honest we won't be coming back. It wasn't just the waitress it was the hostes as well. From the beginning it was on overall annoying experience. Which is such a shame considering the food is great. They should really focus on customer service.",

I have been going to many places here in Arizona,  and to say the least I am always complaining and disappointed, I was on the verge of moving out of Arizona and giving up on this beautiful state because of my love for food.    I decided to give this establishment a try, and Oh My God!  I did not only like it,  I am in Amore! This pizza and calamari is SoooooO delicious,  and the marinara sauce is to die for! Nom Nom Nom!

We both had the personal pizzas because we like completely different toppings.  The wine was a bit pricey for the brand names, but the service was great and the atmosphere was kinda romantic.  We will definitely be telling all our fiends to go there.  IT is in the heart of Glendale and worth the trip from Buckeye.",

House made mozzarella was good but pizza lacked over all flavor. I feel this is another over hyped food network restaurant.  It's hard to find good pizza outside of Chicago.",

I selected this place via Yelp reviews and stopped by on Saturday evening with family and was really hoping the place would not be a disappointment and boy did this gem make me look like a genius. The restaurant was not super busy and we were seated immediately. The staff was so friendly and offered suggestions and were attentive to all our questions. We started with some meatballs that were pretty good. Not amazing but good. For entrees I went with the pesto chicken lasagna, my daughter had the margarita pizza with added pepperoni, and my wife had the caprese salad. Okay, let me start out by saying that I do not really love pesto but WOW that lasagna was a ten in every way. Loved it! Like loved it so much that I want it again now kinda love. So good. My daughters pizza....amazing!!!! Every component to the dish was perfect. The bread/crust/dough, whatever you want to call it was superb. It was so flavorful. You know you hit the jackpot when your child tells you that we need to remember this place so we can come back again. As for the wife's salad, I could not tell you. She never gave this yelper a taste. :) I think she wanted to keep the review all to herself. See if I ever share a bite again. Hahaha!!! If your curious about their salad check out her review at Paige T. She owes me big time for sending my friends her way. :) Overall, an amazing meal and great experience that I will hit up again for sure.",

Maybe Neapolitan's are like that because I've yet to find one with a crispy crust in the middle. They kind of skimp on the basil though. Chicken pesto lasagna was very rich but not enough chicken. It had a nice sauce that I soaked up with the accompanying bread.  Get this if you love cheese. We also had the the rigatoni al forno which didn't seem like anything special.  We calamari and cheesecake passing by our table looked really good but I wasn't hungry enough to try.",

One was more interested in her phone and the guy was lacking all expressions. Thankfully our waitress (I think her name was Patty) was decent. The decor is outdated and could use some color...its very drab and dark in here.  The music is rap...this is an Italian place and the music took away from the experience.

Of course, since I live only 15 minutes away from the place they called pizza heaven, I had to go.  First time I came here, there were people packed on the street, waiting for their turn to be seated. As it was a Sat. night, the wait was 45 minutes. We denied our selves heaven, only because our tummies were NOT gonna be denied any longer PERIOD.  We went to Cibo's ( I will get to that review in a sec) and decided that we'd go to Al Forno next Sat., early next Sat.  We were seated within minutes of arriving early Sat. afternoon, although it was packed. The place was dimly lit, and filled with the aroma of backed goods. We ordered the ITALIAN STALLION and it was on our table and in our mouths in 10 minutes! No really, 10 MINUTES! Their handmade brick oven wasn't joking around!  Now to the Pizza, was it a slice of pizza heaven? Sure...but I'm glad we didn't wait 45 minutes for it. CALM.DOWN.GUY!",

This place is definitely worth it if you happen to venture to the west valley of Phoenix.  Perfect place before a concert/sporting event at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FJobbing.com&s=bfe1441615cc124f967e1a2383957929c5e38ed5068cec9824552316a32edcec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jobbing.com</a> or attending one of the many festivals in downtown Glendale.  La Piazza al Forno is definitely a staple to the area as being a restaurant that serves up great quality food.",

I love not having to wait long for easily the best pizza in the valley. The wood fire grill helps create what can only be described as the best crust ever!  I will back up some of the other statements that the pizza can be somewhat inconsistent and it appears they are really at their best when the owner is cooking. But even the \"bad\" pizzas are still better then most anything else you've had in the valley so there isn't much room to complain.  Also, one of the few places you can still get bottle coke with real sugar. I'm not sure if it's much different  then normal coke, but some people go crazy for that so I thought I would throw that in too.  Have fun and enjoy!",

My search has finally ended. This place blew me away with their wonderful La Piazza Verde with it's tasty carmelized onions, mushrooms, roasted peppers and....drumroll....Arugula! It was a flavor savior and I enjoyed every bite! My wife had the Margherita and she loved it too with it's fresh mozzarrella and tasty basil.   Friendly atmosphere. Great service. Reasonably priced. Make sure you get to try one of their chocolate covered cannolis. To die for, but don't! You want to come back for more!",

The Downtown Glendale area is lacking some public services like dumping the overflowing trash bins on the sidewalks but it didn't stop the food from be spot on.  Kid friendly for sure high chairs available with friendly staff offering up a high chair immediately. I ordered a coke and got an awesome tall cold glass bottle     That was a good way to start my meal.  As a Boston transplant I miss my seafood so I ordered the stuffed shrimp and got a hearty order of 6 stuffed shrimp on toasted sliced bread with olive oil fresh parsley and fresh lemon. Killer app super fresh shrimp. New England Approved stuffed shrimp is a staple in New England.  I followed up with the Gladiator all meat pie with my favorite Schreiners locally cased sausage crumbles and I believe prosciutto shoppers and pepperoni. I only had room for 2 slices and took the rest home to my wife who had to work.   This is an important item not discussed often enough......how well did the leftovers travel? Answer...great they supplied me with a box to box myself and it reheated in the toaster oven great for breakfast this morning!  Great Staff I believe her name is Patty very friendly and attentive.   Make the trip you won't be disappointed if you love quality ingredients and laid back atmosphere and I didn't even wait it was 2pm and I thought I would be waiting but no so another plus.",

    "text": "So the mixed reviews got me a little wary in going here, but I'm here to say that I'm glad I took a chance! The SO and I brought 3 kids, ages 9-15 here for dinner and while they are notoriously pick eaters, they seemed to enjoy themselves!  A big plus, was when I walked in the door and I saw a big table of business men in ties enjoying themselves. Always makes you think the place is going to be good! Haha.  We ordered the Italian Stallion pizza, chicken pesto lasagna, and the four cheese ravioli, along with an appetizer of calamari.  Calamari- very salty, but good texture and not too chewy. Sauce that came with it was good.  Chicken pesto lasagna - Good, but not spectacular. The pasta layers were too chewy.  Four cheese ravioli - Good. The cheese and sauce were really flavorful.  Italian Stallion - Really good! I do have to say, that this pizza is very similar to Bianco's in style and flavor, yet came out faster and I didn't have to wait 3 hours to get into the restaurant. :)  All in all, a great dinner. Our service was good, with frequent water refills and I was able to be seated right away, even though my whole group was not there yet.  -1 star for not having real Italian soda (in a can) and leaving it open for a follow up review when I've tasted more pizza and salad and desserts.  Glad to have been to old town Glendale for the first time, too!",

    "text": "I moved to Phoenix from San Diego about seven years ago and have been in search of a truly GREAT pizza ever since.  The thing about the \"Valley\" is that while there are many places to be seen, have a decent pizza (Grimaldi's & Le Grande Orange are notable) or wait in line for several hours for a \"good\" pie (not even going to go there), I haven't really come across a truly great pie.  While watching Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives a while back I saw the story on La Piazza Al Forno in Glendale and immediately got into the car for a little drive.  Located in the Historic Downtown district, Piazza Al Forno is a modest storefront pizzeria with few tables and a counter with a view of the pizza oven.  The menu is quite simple but has everything you on it that you need.  My dining companion ordered the Pizza Verde (Veggie Pie), a hand stretched pizza covered in San Marzano Tomatoes, House Made Mozzarella, Roasted Peppers, Caramelized Onions, Mushrooms, Olives and Fresh Arugula ($12) which she indicated was quite good.  The \"Italian Stallion\" caught my eye with its mix of  San Marzano Tomatoes, House Made Mozzarella, Schreiners Sausage, Pepperoni, Prosciuttodi Parma and Sopressata ($13), so ride the horse I did!  The pizza arrived hot and bubbling with just the right amount of cheese (Americans cant seem to grasp that a great pizza doesn't need to be covered in an inch of it) and a perfectly crisp crust with that slightly chewy texture that I know and love.  The meats gave my pie a bit of saltiness that my companion didn't like and she seemed to think it was a bit greasy but to me, it was manna from heaven!  If you fancy a pizza made with care and quality ingredients drop in and check out La Piazza Al Forno, it's worth the drive.",

Most of us got pizza, but a couple also went for the pasta dishes.  I split the Italian Stallion pizza and the Chicken Pesto Lasagna with a co-worker.  Both were really, really good.  We also tried the stuffed shrimp and calamari for appetizers.  Shrimp were tasty, calamari was standard fare.  They were out of fried ravioli, but substituted some garlic bread for no charge.  Staff was incredibly friendly. I think we had the owner's daughter for our waitress.  Food was made fast and delivered piping hot.  We did have to wait about 20 minutes for our table, which for such a small space and a group of 8 was amazing. Prices are very reasonable too.  I will definitely return here on future trips to Phoenix!",

My brother had to cough for you to buy a clue we wanted service. After we did get seated and decided what we wanted we were told the shrimp we wanted was not available. Then after picking something else and ordering a salad, it came dry with only a slight drizzle of dressing. At this point a couple walks in and they too have to whistle to get service, totally unacceptable when you only have 4 customers. I ordered the rigatoni which tasted like the pasta had been left out and dried on the edges. My mom ordered the pesto fettuccine which wasn't bad but wasn't good either. My brother ordered the ravioli and said it was good. As we were eating there was some chatter from the kitchen and the language was foul and inappropriate. We over heard the cooks laughing at us because apparently they had saved the last of the shrimp for themselves and decided to cook it while we were there so we could smell it. My mom got up to let them know they had horrible mouths but they never apologized. I was greatly disappointed after all the hype this place received and I can safely say we will not be back. I will say Michelle our server was wonderful and hard working. She did not stop the whole time we were there. I was also very disappointed to see the male employee who was wrapping silverware couldn't even be a gentleman and bring the chairs in from outside before he left. I'm not saying Michelle needed help but it would have been the nice thing to do. Like I said Michelle was awesome and she is the only reason I didn't make a stink about paying for the meal I didn't finish eating.",
