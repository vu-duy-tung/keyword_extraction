    "text": "The night didn't start off great due to an overly long wait for our table. We had a larger party but the wait time kept growing every time we checked in on the wait time. Once we got seated our servers more than made up for it. Holly and James were the absolute greatest. They were fast and kept our drinks full, the bread coming and our appetizers were out quick. Our food was delicious. I eat out a lot and these two were some of the greatest servers I've ever dealt with. It made our night out a really wonderful one. The place was a bit loud and our party was split between two different tables. It would be better if this place could better accommodate larger groups better. If it wasn't for the great food and greater service, the night would have been a bust!",

The place is mainly known for the atmosphere.... everyone can pretty much say the food is eh ok the rolls are amazing but again the food is just ok. This review is literally based on one waitress Amanda! She has been for the last 2 years of my daughters birthday and she is absolutely amazing! She makes my daughter feel super special and I honestly can't thank her enough. Today I wanted to make sure everyone knew how amazing she is! Thanks Amanda!!!!!",

    "text": "I've always loved Texas Roadhouse where ever I go because they're very consistent with food quality and service. They have great food at reasonable prices.  The atmosphere is always fun too.  I've been to almost all of them in the east valley and it's our go to for dinner and drinks before concerts on the west side. This particular establishment has the same food quality and service but's freezing inside!! My food got cold right away because the fans are on so high the cold air blows your napkin around.  And it doesn't matter where you sit.  The place in an ice cube.  I asked the bartender and a hostess if there was anyway to lower the fans and vents but it was no help.   The draft beer is ice cold and served in chilled mugs which would have been nice to enjoy if I didn't feel like i was sitting in a cooler.  We live in always sunny Phoenix but that day was about 67 degrees outside and inside felt about the same. I looked around at other customers and I could tell they were cold as well.  Later we went to visit with some friends and they told me that this Roadhouse is always freezing inside and to that they bring a hoodie when they go there.  I'm not kidding!  So the food was great even though it cold before I could finish it and the service was nice but I doubt I will go back to this restaurant unless I'm wearing proper cold weather clothes.  JAH",

    "text": "My husband brought me here last night to celebrate Mother's Day. There was quite a crowd and we were told that is we wanted to be seated sooner, we could choose the patio. It was starting to cool down, so we decided that would be fine. We were served blueberry lemonade as we waited outside under the misters, that was an awesome touch. A waitress came by offering menus so that people could choose what they wanted prior to being seated. Our orders were written on a slip of paper that we were instructed to hand to our server at our table. It only took about 30 minutes to get a table. This outdoor section is much quieter than inside and there is more space between tables, it is very intimate, but you can still enjoy the ambiance of the place. Our dinner was amazing as always, and our server Krista was fantastic. Our drinks came out almost immediately, followed very quickly by our salads. BY the time we were nearly finished with our salads, our steaks were delivered. We didn't have time to need anything else. The service was absolutely outstanding! Thank you so much for a great date night out Krista! You went above and beyond for us.",

    "text": "10/17/2016 Yelp Review Steakhouses Tempe AZ Texas Roadhouse 8510 S Emerald Rd. Tempe, AZ 85284  (480) 940-7427  I really like this steakhouse, I've been to this location a few times and I am not sure when I will return. If you want me to give a score, I'll give 5 stars (5/5). Why give such a high score, let us start at the beginning.  From the door began, that stood a barrel, which filled with peanuts, to allow customers to wait in advance to feel the enthusiasm of the Texas Roadhouse and not because of waiting to leave. The first time we came here, we waited for about 20 minutes, but I didn't think it was a long time because I chatted with my friends and ate peanuts.  Walk in, we can notice the restaurants decor is really cool, wood high beams, neon signs announcing Beers, and lots of TV's, and I must mention, they have a beautiful showcase filled with hand cut meats, I finally knew how big a piece of meat was 10oz, by the way, each table had a bucket O' peanuts. that's awesome.   The menu was varied, if you like steak, they have all kinds of cuts, like Ribeye, NY Script-Bone and so on. I am very fond of their Rib Eye & Shrimp, to be honest, I would like to go again. Having said that, I have to talk about the impressive bread, Fresh baked, hot, delicious, actually, I have no idea to describe the deliciousness of it. I remember once I took my friend to this steakhouses, I later asked him \"How you felt the steak?\" he told me \"Bread is so good!\" On the taste of steak, as a beef lover, the steaks were well seasoned and cooked just perfect-medium rare, they cooked it the way my wanted which was Medium. If you think the steak does not meet your expectations, you can let the server bring it back to re-process or change a new one, and the manager will come to apologize. Impeccable!  Next on the service, I think it's not necessary to say, in all the restaurants when I came to the United States, this store is the best. The server was constantly checking on us to see if we needed anything, the manager came over to check on us too as he saw us as foreigners. You will feel that your tip is worth it.  The only time I encountered the problem is the amount of money when the checkout. when I found it and go back to ask, the manager is very kindly told me that is their mistakes, and returned my money, including my meal cost of.   I think there is nothing to be fussy; I do like this restaurant very much, especially their breads which is free. If you have not been there yet, I highly recommended you try this and I promise it will not let you down.",

I was already done eating by the time she got her food. This happened the past two times we've been there!! The waitress was extremely slow. I sat there with no water for 15-20mins. We lost our keys and the lady at the front could have cared less. Didn't want to help us find them at all. When I asked again she seemed annoyed. I understand they were busy however as a returning customer who would come in often I feel we should all get good service. I will most likely but be returning to this location.",

Our server natasha was right there checking on us helping us pick our abundance of heavenly food. She had a smile on her face the whole time and we felt like the only customers in the overly crowded restaurant and that speaks volumes. The food was fresh and Truthfully best steak place I've ever been too! Just the right amount of hot served really quickly. Potatoe wedges were crispy and amazing. The blue margarita was refreshing and sweet, the chilli was perfect and flavorful.  The ribs fell off the bone and steak melted in my mouth! . The moral of my story is food heaven is in a corner of Tempe called Texas roadhouse and it's amazing angel is named Natasha! After a long week, some bad news, and alot of work this place made my week! Thank you Natasha!!! I will enjoy my leftovers and come back soon",

That is what I took the point off for.  I also didn't like the same loud music in the bathroom.  I like to pee in quiet. So does my daughter.  They weren't bad, just loud.",

    "text": "We are visiting the area from OKC to attend my husband's work conference- a bunch of restaurant chain GMs who meet yearly. We LOVE Texas Roadhouse and visit often back home in OKC. Our home location has set the bar pretty high in all areas of restaurant experience, I'll admit, but this location really fell flat.   The hostess started walking us to our table before it was even clean. I found it very odd. We all stood there, just awkwardly watching the busser clean the table. Before he had even finished (we obviously hadn't sat down yet), the hostess sat the plates and silverware down and wished us a good meal and walked away. It seemed a bit rude, but whatever. Not that big of a deal, although odd.  It took several minutes for anyone to come by to greet us and get our drink order. It was probably about 7-10 minutes or so. As a former server, and sitting at a table with 3 current restaurant GMs, we found that outrageous. Finally the server came by and got our drink orders. We were also ready to order since we'd sadly had several minutes to decide before he even showed up.  Then, the food seemed to take forever. My 3 year old, whom I will admit was already tired, actually fell asleep before it arrived. At least the four salads came out fast and tasted good, but nobody ever offered more bread to us and the server didn't even stop back to check on us while we waited for the food. We stacked up our salad bowls, forks, and small plates at the end of the table and watched him walk by it countless times, empty handed. Again a big strike for us. He stopped by to grab the dishes after being stacked there for quite awhile, and didn't offer anything else or really check on us.  Finally he brought out our food but had another server pass it all out as he rushed away, saying he'd be right back. He did not come right back.   My husband and I both ordered medium rare steaks- mine was fortunately cooked perfectly (although had several tough, chewy pieces) but his was cooked medium. He mentioned to the other server that it was a bit overcooked but not to worry about it; we were hungry and not willing to wait any longer.  Our server came back nearly halfway through the meal to check on us. Honestly it wasn't worth us listing out all our complaints because he didn't seem too interested in us in the first place and we figured it would take half an hour before he got back with us, anyways. Ironically, his name was that of a very fast plane...  We had empty glasses and had to ask a nearby server to get our server for some refills. He didn't even bother asking the waiter to take care of it- maybe he's used to this happening. He grabbed us more drinks himself. I watched as a young couple (also in our server's section) waiting entirely too long to receive their first round of beverages.  It seemed he only had 3 tables total, and several times I saw him stand and playfully converse with coworkers at the POS station like he had nothing to do, so I was a bit confused as to why he wasn't more attentive. We are very easy customers who rarely complain but would not come back to this location if we lived in the area. I am used to seeing a manager walk around and touch tables, making sure everyone has been served appropriately, so it was strange not seeing that- I'm not sure I saw a manager at all, actually, and I was definitely looking for one.  We had to ask for our check and he didn't offer to split it. We were afraid it would take too long to have it corrected so we just used cash to chip in on our portions so we could leave. :/",

Staff - The staff is super friendly. They play country music and they do this little dance to pump up the customers.  Food - If you check in on yelp get a free appetizer with the purchase of two entrees. If you get hungry before you get your food they do provide peanuts and this delicious freshly baked bread with apple butter. The portions are pretty big so make sure to go hungry.  The one thing I did not like about Texas roadhouse is that if you sit at the bar and want to watch a certain game on tv they will not change the channel for you.",

Salad was decent because how do your really mess up a Caesar salad. The best part of the meal was their famous bread.   Our server was a sweetheart and I'm sure if I had complained she would've taken the food off the check. But I didn't want to make a fuss because a.) I didn't feel like being that girl and b.) honestly I'm just not convinced the quality of the food is very good.

Today my family and I arrive (party of 7). My mother, sister and two nephews arrive before my wife, kid and I do. My mother is told that they will not accommodate us until everyone arrives our party even though we were less than 5 minutes away. That alone is strange but ok.  We all are now in the lobby and ready to be seated to only be told we now have to wait which immediately frustrated me. As we stood patiently waiting, we watched one large party after another walk in and are seated immediately. At this point I'm very frustrated and am ready to take our business somewhere else.   After some time we were finally seated and noticed we are under an air conditioning vent. No big deal however it got very cold for the young kids we had with us. We asked our server if the air could be adjusted. The server comes back and says that management will adjust the fan. Fifteen minutes later and no change was made. We asked to speak with management and basically received no response.   I'm not sure if we will return to this location again. We definitely are not satisfied with the service provided this time around.",

Caesar salad had what tasted like a mayonnaise dressing, croutons were good and lettuce fresh. Entrees arrived and were cooked perfectly to order. My wife's mashed potato side was seemingly a third butter. I had ordered a sweet potato with butter; and it arrived as ordered. What was not expected, was that the potato itself was spoiled.  It tasted strongly of vinegar and the taste in my mouth as the seconds rolled by was quite disgusting.  The server was quick to apologize and bring a different side.  The reason for 3 stars was for the rotten sweet potato, and the fact that no manager came to the table to check on us or our complaint.",

That says volumes of you know how I love ribs. They were oddly salty. Also no BBQ sauce on the table.  My loaded baked potato $.99 more was tasteless. And dry. Hubby had the BBQ chicken. He said it was ok. Not great.  The fresh vegetables consisted of broccoli and carrots and they were rock hard. He also had the loaded sweet potato which came topped with marshmallows and brown sugar sauce. He said it was sweet but good.  Our waitress was very nice and stopped by four or five times until we were half way through the meal. Then I never saw her and I never got a refill on my drink. She finally popped back on after another waitress saw our empty plates for a long time and took them away.  Pros- it's cheap. Dinner for two under $30.  But not for me.",

I did sign up for their birthday club, which gets you a free appetizer, which is a good deal, because I would have had it removed from the bill.  Onion blossom.....really weird almost chemical taste.  The sirloin was good, the filet was good, the burger.... Not so much.  Fries were soggy, I asked for crispy...... No problem, the sent them back looking nice and brown.....and still soggy.  Not sure how that happened but it really did.  Our waitress was nice, but not very fast.  Every plate including the bread plates, were left on the table.   I thought when the entrees were brought out they would clear the table, but sliding and shuffling was more convenient for her I guess.  Cool looking restaurant, but it's definitely not for us.",

When we sat down, we knew exactly what we wanted because we have gone to the TRH around Metro center and it was AMAZING.  So we ordered right away and our server was very nice.  Both of us ordered the filet medallions done medium.  We waited longer than the other tables (who were all sat after us) for our food.  Maybe 40 mins or so.   When we finally got our food- one was missing rice.  And both were cooked well done.  They took our plates back and we sat for another 20 mins waiting to eat.  Manager came by to appoligize.  We told him we understood- it was busy after all.  He told us he would \"take care of it\".  Then our server (who was still very pleasant) came back with our new plates.  She said she was sorry and that the manager was going to take care of it.  Apparently \"take care of it\" no longer means taking it off the bill btw. One of my filets were still well done and my rice was cold.  Not cool.  Cold.  But I was pretty hungry so I just shut up at that point.  The loaded mashed potatoes were awesome.  And I have to say their house salad is amazing too. Waitress comes by and asks if it is way better. I just smiled and asked for the check.  She asked if we wanted refills on our tea.  I said no thank you, just the check please.  And she said ok and left.   For 30 MINUTES!!!!!   I was so flaming mad.   When she finally remembered us I got the check and it had a $10 discount on it.  So that is how the manager \"took care of it\".  2 hours later we finally left.  :( date night offically ruined.",

The rolls would have been gone as well. At the end she did bring us to go boxes but, she did not bring lids for the ranches. And when ask for them you could see her standing by the kitchen taking her time. At the end my husband had to go get the to go bag. Now on to the food it was pretty delicious 8 OZ ,steak, shrimp corn ,and was cooked to perfection. However , loaded baked potato was uncooked. The  next dinner 8oz steak, shrimp, rice and chili all cooked to perfection. The  appetizers we order were  the Cactus Blossom was overcooked but the Buffalo wings  were good.

Ordered a beer as right away, wife hadn't decided yet so she ran & got my beer. Came back and waited while my wife was still deciding, she hurried up to order as she wasn't going to ask if she needed more time soy wife just ordered something. Our other members showed up within 5 minutes, and as soon as they sat dow she returned, and asked if we were ready to order. I said we'll have an appetizer, and they hurriedly ordered a drink. She returned quickly with app & drinks and asked if ready to order again, I had checked menu previously, wife and company hadn't checked. We said,could you give us a minute. She returned in a minute, maybe 2, we had no time to talk amongst ourselves, so I ordered while everyone else were quickly trying to decide, while she waited. Obviously we weren't ready but she wasn't leaving or asking about more time. Again they hurriedly ordered. Service was decent. And she returned w/check when we were 2/3 finished with our meal. I understand, the more tables you can flip on your shift, the more money you can make. She's a good waitress, but rushing customers through their entire meal is not going to get much of a big tip. The burgers seemed nice the two poeple at are party said they were good. My country tips dinner, not good, every bit of steak was fatty. Kind of ruins the meal. Won't be going back",

    "text": "I have always always always been a super fan of texas roadhouse! Let me start by saying that. But on this particular day at this particular restaurant location, so many things went wrong. I came for lunch with my mom and sister & to begin with I almost slipped and fell because there was spilled water by the rug as I was walking over it. Mind you, Im pregnant & all the waitress said was please be careful. I thought that was inconsiderate & they should have dried it up, I dont think they did. Once we got to our booth, we ordered fried pickles and the silverware was still wet as though they had just taken them out of the dishwasher & just threw them in the napkins. Our food was extremely salty. I had a kabob and my sister had the salmon with rice, and my mom had steak and shrimp. All very salty. The best part was that our waitress was EXTREMELY NICE & She was very patient with us. That made our day! Hopefully they keep her because people like us will come back because of her great service!",

I had not been to a Texas Roadhouse in many years - remembering it as being so - so. I can say for certain, that we will be back again soon. We checked in online which I highly recommend. When we arrived, we had a quick 10-15 minute wait instead of 50 which is what they were on for walk-ins.  The beer was ice cold - served in chilled mugs and our meals were excellent. I had the pulled pork dinner which left me enough for leftover lunch the next day and that made me super happy. Meat was tender, delicious, not too fatty, and they served it with a roll in case you wanted to make a sandwich. The seasonal vegetables were broccoli and were perfectly steamed. Not drowning in butter or salt - they were actually fresh. My husband had the prime rib and said it was outstanding. I'll take his word for it, he had not to take home. Kids had cheeseburgers from the kids menu. One didn't love that the bun.. but the other ate everything.  Our server, Brittany was great. She was friendly and made sure we had beverages and everything else we needed. She even gave the kids temporary tattoos at the end of the meal which they are now wearing.",

I usually always go for the filet mignon and they always cook it exactly how i like it. You can choose from 2 sides and my go to is the house salad with ranch, and i don't know why but this salad is so tasty even though it's an average salad. I mentioned their bread and it's a nice perk that they bring these out to you as soon as you sit down with butter that must be spread on your roll! I promise you won't be disappointed you will only leave being addicted to their rolls.",

We make the 15 minute trip, wait 45 minutes for a table and are sat next to a party of 15. I understand that this is a lot for one server, but this should have been addressed from the very begging. Our serve got our drink order after 10 minutes sitting and we ordered our free appetizer. A different person brought the water and another different person brought the appetizer. We asked for bread and it was never delivered. After sitting another 15 minutes with empty waters and still haven't even placing our order, I got up to ask to to order and explained how frustrating it was being ignored. Meanwhile the big party got 2 rounds of bread and plenty of drink refills. They give us another server who was prompt in taking our order and bringing bread but I was still very annoyed. The manager came over to tell us she comped our appetizer.... sweet, the appetizer that was going to be comped in the first place.... the reason for the negative review is our bill wasn't any less expensive for receiving behind subpar service. Oh and to top it off our original server came over to say sorry and that she did forget about us, like that is supposed to make it right? I don't know, overall a very dissatisfied customer.  Oh and my chicken had mashed potatoe remnants on it, I ordered a baked potato, so it was plated with mashed and then just sloppily put on a different plate.   Never going to this location again.",

I don't know what is worse that they served it twice the same or that they don't know how gravy should look. The manager came over to give us the the re make and we pointed out that the gravy was thin and showed her by poring it from the dish to the plate. It is a shame that they have a manager that did not say that is not right either because it was NOT! I think she said good luck and got out quick. It didn't seem to matter that the remake was as poor as the first. I don't think my husband will ever go back ! By the way this is what my husband orders all the this at this establishment across many Texas road houses and not ever was the gravy this bad.",

It doesn't really matter which state or city you are in, Texas roadhouse always delivers the same quality and good service with the exception of only one location that we ever went to that was terrible.  Our waitress at the bar was Shawna and she was very polite and nice and kept my sweet iced tea flowing all night long.  Texas roadhouse always has decent music, and lots and lots of people there. So if you're going to go on a Friday or Saturday call in for a reservation or show up there a little bit earlier than normal.  My only criticism of this location is that I wish my loaded sweet potato would've had a little bit more sweetness to it like most of the other times that I get it. It wasn't bad though.  Stop by and give them a taste!",

I usually come here with my buddies to get a beer and watch the games. The service was amazing for a Saturday night. The waitress Cassie was awesome. She's going to school to be a physical therapist and the manager Lindsay was helpful as well. I will always come back here since you can get a good steak to go. Also the bread is amazing as well. They make sure the service is 100% on point. As busy as they were they still took care of me and my family and I appreciate it. They were honest with there wait time and made my families night a good night. Vanessa is a good person to talk to as well",

My sweet potato was so tasty too! Love the food! My only complaint is the way they billed me for a loaded sweet potato when I only asked for butter as a topping and charged me $1.99. I'm pretty sure the scoop of butter cost less than that!",

In a city where there are restaurants on every corner, this matters, and makes their five star rating well earned.  I LOVE Texas Roadhouse. The chili is amazing, some of the best filets, who doesn't like bread with cinnamon sugar butter?! Downside of moving, we don't have one up in Flagstaff, so this is a must stop once a month when I am in Phoenix. Location is close to my Phoenix office, and walking distance from my preferred hotel in the area. Service was good, steak was prepared as ordered and fast (under 10 minutes from ordering to the table), and the tv's everywhere around the bar ensured I did not miss Monday Night Football. Jordan was great, made sure my sweet tea was full and even brought me one to go at the end of my meal. All in all a great experience, I will be back again and again and again.",

Upon walking in, there was an impressive looking case of steaks and it had a nice casual rustic atmosphere. Our waitress was prompt and nice enough. However, this was a terrible first experience in regards to the cuisine. We started off with the Cactus Blossom and that was alright. I had the steak and ribs combo, I asked for medium and my steak arrived with a heartbeat. The ribs were decent and probably the best part besides the appetizer of our meal. My girlfriend ordered a dish that ended up just being hamburger, which she wasn't very impressed by. We tried a variety of sides that included; buttered corn, cup of chili, green beans and mashed potatoes. The corn tasted just like corn out of the can at home, the chili tasted like Nalley's and actually had fatty pieces of meat in it, the green beans had a funky aftertaste and the mashed potatoes were nothing special. I've never left so much food uneaten on a table before and was shocked that our waitress didn't notice this and ask if anything was wrong with the food or offer a discount/refund. I try not to make one time judgments of a restaurant, as any place can have an off day, but with just so much wrong with everything on this visit, I will definitely not be returning here.",

We didn't expect this place to set the bar so high for a slab of beef, but this place KILLS Sizzler on both quality and price.  We thought that it even edged out other prominent steak places like Outback, Longhorn, and Black Angus for quality, while totally beating them in price.  Maybe we'll go there sometime and they'll suck, but they didn't this time.  Good service, great steak and great price--we will be back to Texas Roadhouse.  Just one warning--allergic to nuts?  Don't get within 10 feet of the door.  There's peanut shells everywhere.",

For that reason, we decided to visit this Phoenix area Texas Roadhouse near Ikea right off I-10 & Warner. It looked busy in the parking lot, but we walked right in and were seated immediately. Service started out good - drink order was taken right away and delivered quickly. We placed our order, ate those great rolls, and sat and sat and sat . . . usually they are quick with the salad followed by the main course. Salads finally arrived - finished those and sat and sat . . . finally the main course arrived. Split plate missing, no gravy for the chicken fried steak, drink refills had to asked for . . . this is not normal for Texas Roadhouse and it's not even that busy ! Talked about service, now the food - salads great, check - dallas filet great, check - chicken fried steak not so good, overcooked, forgot gravy, my last chicken fried chicken was way better - other sides ok, nothing special. Lastly, went to restroom, plates cleared away, came back - still no check. Server came by . . . oops, forgot to print your bill - be right back . . . ?? I gave this a 3 - probably higher than maybe deserved, but \"the roadhouse\" usually gets 5 - enough said. Probably not going back to this location in the near future.",

I'm not a fan of all the nut shells on the floor but I guess it hides the dropped fork I keep stepping on.  Food finally arrives and it's cooked to perfectly. Mashed potatoes were super salty tho... ick. The servers, runners and busters couldn't have been nicer. Not my favorite place but others seem to really like it....",

Our server was rude , sarcastic & in a big hurry to get us gone. I contacted a manager the following day. The manager apologized & offered to give us a comp for our dinner & an appetizer.   But that is not where the story ends..  We went back for the dinner comp but wanted to speak to a manager before even ordering to ensure there wasn't any suprises later. He came over and wanted to know why we wanted a free dinner. I explained what happened & who I spoke to about it. He wanted to see my email from them. When I responded that I wasn't sure they sent me one, he became very rude. He stated that that is not how it works & couldn't honor any verbal conversation I had previously. I explained she also logged my phone number which could be pulled up to see what was offered to us. He said no nope, I couldn't just have people come in here & get free food on their word. He went to tell us, I'm not just a manager I am the owner. He said that he could call her to see if she remembers our conversation or not. I said ok. He came back to say she didn't speak to me & didn't remember any call like that. He made a few more comments whic ensuinated that we were trying to scam him. I had to keep my husband from leaving. The owner said, well I will give you one free dinner but that's it because this is costing me money & I'm not in the habit of doing that! I was offended which I believe was his intention. My husband told him that we are not in the habit of getting free food because we pay our own way.  The owner rolled his eyes & said something under his breath. I told him ok but I'm still going to look for the email on my phone. He said good & walked away.   I went through my emails & found the manager's email. I told my server to let the owner know. He briskly walked up, took a look at the email & said, \"see I told you we do it that way\" then quickly walked off. There was not an apology for being offensive, obnoxious or clueless on how to speak to customers. This was the last time we will ever go to this location.   The highlight which I don't want to overlook, the server we had was very excellent. She was attentive & ensured our order was correct. I know this location will have other great servers if you should chose to go there for dinner.  I hope you don't have any problems during your experience because I know who you will be dealing with in the end. Good luck!",

We were a little hesitant to order steak here, but we went with one steak entree and one burger. My little got a kids menu burger (2 large sliders, she didn't even touch her fries). We started our meal with a combo app dish that had rattle snake bites (think Moz sticks but these are balls and it's pepper jack instead of Moz), tater skins and boneless Buffalo wings. The tastiness of the wings was surprised us; not overly breaded at all. The larger burger was good and cooked to order. My steak was so yummy, cooked well, well seasoned and I asked for caramelized onions and mushrooms (it was extra but totally worth it). Our server was great, he had recommendations and was attentive. They have discounts for military on Veterans day during lunch.",

You would too if you tried those flaky, warm honey rolls. This food is good ole fashioned, stick your ribs grub! Are you the kind of person who wants an entire dining experience? Texas Roadhouse is for you! The servers dance periodically to country music, free peanuts and bread while you're waiting, hurt your teeth sweet tea, flat screen tvs everywhere- this place has it all! The wait time reflects quite a few people are in on this \"secret,\" so be prepared to wait during peak hours. Conveniently Texas Roadhouse allows you to view wait times on Yelp!!",

    "text": "This is my First time at Texas Roadhouse,,and I knew I was in trouble,,moment I stepped inside I knew,, because I didn't have my Tony Lama boots. Those who don't know, they are not made of Lama, although some may be but mine are Ostrich,,handmade,,I even told them to leave the Ostrich Feathers on,,makes for great conversation, especially at Church, but not to worry, I only wear them when its my turn to do the Sunday reading. So back to the review.  This place is pretty cool and incredible,, walked in and you won't BELIEVE  this,,but the hostess was 7 FEET TALL!! She greeted us and I freaked out! Then, realized she had to step down from the hostess podium and man, I was relieved! Whew! That would have been the conversation all night long at our table! Everybody else's table too.  Our hostess guides us to our seats (we are a party of 3) and I almost get whiplash when we pass this beautiful showcase filled with hand cut meats! (please see picture) Ok, first star! I mean, come on! When you go to the Supermarket and tell the butcher at the meat counter \"this one waay up front\" don't you secretly wish you could also say, \"can you please fire it up back there, medium rare?\" I know I do.  Wonder if they'll do it? Hmmm... We arrive at the table and notice the restaurants decor is really cool,, wood high beams, neon signs announcing Beers, and lots of TV's (seemed like 30!) Every game being played on Earth was on some TV! Think even a peewee football game was on-going!  So each table had a bucket O' peanuts,, nice; no peanut allergies here!  Tip, if you do have high peanut allergies, stay away, cause you won't leave walking.  Menu was extensive and varied- Second star--If you like STEAK,, they have all kinds of cuts! Ribeye (my fav), Sirloin ( Royalty wooo, Sir Loin), NY Strip, T-Bone (sounds like a rapper). Please Read the menu to know more, as it is impossible to recite the whole thing..Please see picture, thank you.  Our server Miss Jacky was at the helm,, she was fantastic! Third Star- Being our first time here, she was sooo tolerant and patient explaining the entire menu and showing us all the nice photos,, I'm talking really courteous! SHOW ME THE WINE LIST! please,,,  Tip: Miss Jacky even told us about ordering a side of ribs on our entree for only $6.99 extra,, super deal! Also: **Free appetizer on the Yelp app!! Even the laziest can push the button to get a free appetizer!! Come on!,,, put your finger to good use!! We ordered the Cactus Blossom! Please See picture... I heard Angels sing and Heavenly Trumpets going (but to be fair could have been all the TV's making me Bubble-headed) when I saw,, Bone-in-Rib-Eye ! This entree comes with 2 sides. Therefore, Our order consisted of:  3  20oz Bone-in's  (easy now)  2 Caesar Salad, 2 baked potatoes, mash and one Garden salad,,, and VINO!!(prices are super reasonable but meager selection) Pretty Epic! (plagiarized this from Yelp since it keeps blinking) ((pictures)) Fourth Star- The taste was way beyond- The steaks were well seasoned and cooked just perfect-medium rare. I did not even salt the darn thing! Happy happy indeed. The baked potato had all the usual suspects,,,butter, sour cream, bacon bits, cheese. All Were Found Guilty! So I lined them up, handed down a sentence, and as punishment, ate the whole thing with a John Wayne squint pilgrim!  Prices? Traumatizing!! Ok,, Wow,, the pricing was so reasonable, it felt like I was robbing the place!! Look at the pic's! I wanted to turn myself in and looked all over the place for the SHERIFF to haul me away, but no sheriff in sight (Guess Bob Marly is in town!) Saw a manager walking around checking! Oh! Is she going to escort me out cause of the way I was ripping and tearing at my meat,, that, or she found out about my Boots? Nope, she was checking in on patrons at the restaurant making sure all was well...Star #5 Altogether, it made for a pleasant dinner! Will definitely be back! Ok so now to do the Star math ( throughout my academic life,, Yes! I went to skool silly!) my professors always used 2 words- Excellent Guess! Made me feel good to hear the word Excellent,,so,equation below: 3 X 2 = 6minus 2 for the weak wine list, carry the 1 for scaring me with the hostess ===TOTAL= 4 Stars!! Plenty of parking! Check it out for yourself!",

No worries because it comes on the side. Swap it out for Honey Mustard.  It was delicious. Both my kids got the kids sliders w/fries. They were perfect. Server was very polite and prompt.

Be sure you have some of the (free) bread that they bring....it's so worth every calorie, especially with the delicious apple butter. We had their equivalent of a Blooming Onion and it was quite big and tasty if you're into onion-y things.  Our server Taylor was really sweet and was even playing with the child at the table next to us, it was pretty cute to watch.  I got the pulled pork. It was pretty good. My only real complaint was that my fries were really dry, like end-of-the-batch fries.  Reasonable prices, good food - I will be back!",

With stars and stripes decor, a wait staff wearing \"support our troops\" shirts, steaks, and friendly people, it may be as close as Gilbert gets to Texas. Conveniently located just of the interstate, it makes for an easy stop while traveling along the 202.  The hostesses and wait staff are inviting, and bartender Paul ran the bar impeccably well. The steaks are okay; not great but where else can you get bread, salad, steak and potatoes for $20-25? The ambiance is inviting and family friendly, with the best of 80s, 90s, and today's Country music playing in the background. The bar area also has a number of televisions broadcasting sporting events. Every once in a while, the waitresses will get together and do a line dance. This brings me to my only complaint. No self-respecting, red-blooded Texan would be caught dead listening to the Dixie Chicks after the stunt they pulled in 2003. Although, the wait staff did make up for playing the country music outcasts by also line dancing to Brooks and Dunn. During my stint in Phoenix, I ate here many times. Don't come here expecting the best steak you've ever had. However, they offer decent food for reasonable prices in a family-friendly atmosphere.",

When we were seated though the booth wasn't well cleaned and I had to wait for someone to come clean the bench seat so we could sit down. Thumbs down for that! But then Miranda arrived! She was friendly. She was knowledgeable. She was efficient. She kept our glasses refilled. She was fabulous! The food was good and came out just as ordered. Overall a very nice experience.",

I was in disbelief that we were given such a nasty message.  I deem that is the trend at this place and instead of tables they should set up narrow counters along the walls so that you ca chug the food down to make space for the next one.

It is obvious that the place just is not used to handling crowds and is still trying to learn to be a restaurant. Had to constantly ask staff for beverage refills ... My pet peeve. After almost 40 minutes our server arrived with our order .. One short, telling us they ran out of chicken. They just realized that when they went to deliver the order. The manager, Hilson, came out apologized, took a replacement order and delivered that swiftly.  They were quick to assume responsibility for the situation, comped the person for the inconvenience and gave them a voucher for another free new. What we did order was good. Will give them one more try. Too many other steak restaurants in the area where I know I can get a good meal and good service.",

Food came, it was consistent Texas Roadhouse and we were satisfied. The manager didn't give us a discount but actually gave us the entire bill for free.

    "text": "Visited for the first time yesterday for Sunday dinner. I had been to the Mesa location and enjoyed it and this one is closer to my house.  My daughter and I got the half rack ribs. Mine was so burnt it tasted like a charcoal briquette smothered in bottled barbecue sauce.  The mashed potatoes were congealed Into the shape of a splat where the cook had slopped a spoonful into the dish. I took a bite and got a mouthful of half a raw potato.  My daughter was too mortified to complain about hers (she's 15). Her baked potato was good. We paid an extra dollar for it to be 'loaded' which meant a handful of shredded cheese and some bacon bits.  Even the famous bread tasted like stale reheated King's Hawaiian rolls.   My husband liked his chicken fried steak, he got 'loaded' steak fries, which again was a hand full of shredded cheese all in one spot with some bacon bits. The side salads were the best thing there. Then they still charged me for my dinner until we asked to have it removed and only pay for the salad. (I had returned it after one bite) The manager never came by. So if you like Texas Roadhouse, do yourself a favor and drive to Stapley. Although there is usually a wait, now I know why this location didn't have a wait.",

Did a call ahead just for our party to get there and had to wait 25 mins just to get two booths in the back, back to back. how can we celebrate a b-day  while sitting separate!? The food took for ever to come out and never got the drinks. Some of us never got food! Some of the food was wrong...Then the server was stressed out or annoyed or something. Idk if she was stressed out with us or that it was a busy Friday night but it defiantly rubbed off on us and made us feel like we were the prob. I feel like she knows its a busy restaurant deal with it or dont  Asked to speak with a manager witched never showed. Idk if the server did not send for them or they just dint care enough to come see how our experience was. Will not be going to this location again..",

    "text": "As a regular customer at the Texas Roadhouse establishments, I was not pleased with the service that I received this evening. We happily came to celebrate my sisters 18th birthday, but our night was ruined by a balding, 25 year old male, who looked like Francis from Pee-wee's Big Adventure (not an exaggeration). He threw napkins and straws at us if it was hay and we were a herd of cattle being fed for the day and when we kindly complained to the service manager, she said, \"I'll do the best I can to fix his mistakes, and will give y'all a different waiter\". When we told \"Francis\" (real name Chop, I know right?) he was not our waiter anymore, he shouted out in glee, \"yay! that is AWESOME!!!!\". We were sat at a booth that did not fit my party, so a chair was added to the end of the table. This gave an opportunity for the vulgar waiter and his friends to rudely bump into my aunt, and slightly spill water on her. This made us to take it up to James, the general manager, and he told us, \"do you want to stay here, or want me to throw you out. I have the best servers in the world, and if I saw anyone of them do that, they would be FIRED on the spot\". We told him we'll just enjoy the bread and cinnamon butter, with his red, flustered, sweaty face that gave the look of disgust and walked away. If my sister was not craving a 20 oz prime rib (which they did not have) we would have left, but we stayed because she also wanted a steak. Jordan, a nice girl, who looks like she is going to gain a pharmacy degree and a 4.0 GPA was then assigned as our waitress. Not once did she hesitate with our request, if James would show leadership, I would have gave 5 stars just for Jordan! when it came time to say the famous \"YEEEHAAAW\" for birthday guest, Jordan was the ONLY one who came and announced the birthday. I have the snapchats to prove it. Jordan was the only server who met our needs and went above and beyond with everything she did. Jordan exudes success and she should be promoted.",

Hostess was very friendly and polite. Took the liberty of telling me her favorite dishes and recommendations   since I had never been a Texas Roadhouse before. Our server, Jett was flawless in every way. Very polite and friendly and always super fast as well as attentive, even though it was peak dinner time and he had a full section. The food was spectacular. Had the cactus onion as an appetizer and the country fried sirloin with loaded mashed potatoes and green beans as my entree. I've worked in restaurants for five years and now manage an establishment and can say in my professional opinion this restaurant is run to 100% quality from the staff to the food and drinks. It was an amazing experience and will definitely be back very very soon. Most credit going to Jett. Management should feel as lucky to have him on their staff as I was to have him as a server.",

Our wait of 25 minutes wasn't bad at all, considering we had no reservation & it was Mother's Day weekend, and we ended up having a wonderful dining experience. Our server, Anne, was awesome - so friendly and attentive - and our meals were absolutely delicious. My husband's steak was perfectly prepared, as was my grilled shrimp. Given the quality of the food and service at this location (especially on such a busy weekend), it is obvious they have a great manager (who actually visited our table) who keeps his employees' morale high.

And this was on a Sunday night.  When the steaks arrived finally, one was over cooked (medium was well done), and my children's medium steak was raw (not rare, but raw). And they completely forgot their side orders. For the first time in my life, I sent food back. It was simply unsafe to eat. They shared my steak with me, because after waiting an hour-and-half, we couldn't possibly wait another 30 minutes for them to correct their mistake.  Javier, our waiter, was no where to be found for long periods of time. Twice we needed drink refills, and after waiting for long periods of time, I asked another waiter/waitress to kindly find him...  Although I spoke to the manager and he apologized, the damage was done. Never again will I subject my kids or myself to such poor, careless service again! Way to go ruining a birthday dinner, Texas Roadhouse! Thanks for nothing! I'll spend my money elsewhere.",

There was a ton of people waiting & it made it a little awkward to find a spot that was not in anyone's way.  We waited about 30 minutes before we were seated. Our sever, Andrea (Drea on her name tag) was fantastic!! She made sure that everything was refilled before we were empty, which for me is a huge deal. She was very friendly & checked on our table regularly. I give Drea alone 5 stars!! I was pleased with my rib eye expect for the fact I ordered medium rare & it came out medium. I think the quality of food for your money is great!!  The only thing that was a little off putting was the loud music & every once in awhile the servers had to dance.

Shanda the bartender was there both times and she was great! Tentative and made sure we enjoyed ourselves! Actually remembered us from the first visit. These two visits were a drastic improvement from before. Granted initially it was a group of 6 and this time 2 people. We will continue to go back until something further happens.",

I showed up at the stated time and we were seated at our table 2 minutes after we walked in. And the house was packed! The average wait time was 60-90 minutes. The staffing NEVER disappoints. Everyone is extremely friendly. It did take a while for the waitress to greet us and then took even longer to get our bar order but I understand it was a Saturday night with a full house. And how can you be mad after all you are seated with a basket of the best fresh rolls in town! Our waitress was excellent! I explained to her that I knew the portions were big and that I was looking for a small portion, and she was able to come up with several options for me. Now that's service! The food was excellent and we all left happy and extremely full.",

We took a short drive to the restaurant had a short wait for a table. Our server was Jessie and she was very friendly and informative! We told her it was our first time here and she gave us a quick rundown of the menu.   Checking in on Yelp! offers a free appetizer and we got the blooming cactus blossom. It was a great presentation and we ate most of it.   We ended up getting some steaks and sides and really enjoyed our meals. On Wednesday's they have a sirloin special for $10.99 which was cool! My brother and I got ribeyes. The meat was cooked very well and so tender. My only small complaint is that my piece seemed a little heavy handed with the salt. My brother's piece was perfect!!   My favorite part about this place is their rolls!!! I don't even know what they put on them, but W O W. They come out hot and fresh along with a cinnamon butter!! It is seriously addicting!   We will probably be back to this franchise again! We had a great experience!   *if you have a sensitive peanut allergy, be cautious as there are peanut shells everywhere!*",

Super nice and on top of everything, really unexpected. Thanks Dillon. The beer... oh my goodness... the frosty cups! Why don't more establishments serve their beer this way?? Tasty. The main part of our meal was fine. Steak cooked well, great beer, yummy bread. The kids meal hotdog wasn't all that great. Dry dog and soggy fries. The toddler didn't care much, he picked out the good pieces. The side salad lettuce had some browning to it, and the mashed potatoes tasted sweet, didn't eat them, didn't return them. It was fine, who needs potatoes when you get pillowy warm bread!",

When I went there recently I kept thinking of how good the rolls will be and the food is mediocre from past experience, but this time around it was actually a very good tasting dish.   I decided to order the smoothed chicken with a side of loaded mash potatoes and a caesar salad. The salad was a nice balanced salad with tasty coutons and the chicken tasted perfect all around with well cooked onions, mushrooms and cheese on top. Whatever they seasoned the chicken with it tasted awesome! Now the loaded mash potatoes we're just a great dish I could eat everyday. Nice smooth mash potatoes with a nice amount of cheese, bacon and sour cream. I felt like it was a little heavy handed on the sour cream but it was delicious.   Our server was pretty awesome and very attentive on  a very busy early evening. Kind of impressed this time around going to Texas Roadhouse and I do feel like I'll make another trip there soon!",

Texas was not kidding when their slogan's \"Go big or go home,\" because BIG is definitely what we received from service to food to SMILES! All of my food came out probably no longer than 5 minutes, 10 minutes tops, and all of the food came out steaming hot! Our server was very attentive to our every need and always stopped by to make sure we were content with everything despite how busy it was the night we visited.

We moved to chandler in November and have done takeout twice at this location: First time we ordered two dinners...wife's shrimp was absolutely burnt. Tasted like rubber and she threw almost the entire dinner away. My medium rare steak was dry and borderline well done.  Tonight we ordered an app and 3 dinners: Blossom: basically a raw onion. It was cut on the outside and breaded but one large uncut and unbreaded center. Wife's sweet potato was totally blackened. Pure black marshmallows. Sister's chicken entree was missing cheese. My burger was missing all toppings and was overdone.  One time of mistakes is understandable...steaks can be overdone sometimes. But tonight's dinner was just complete lack of consideration with horribly obvious mistakes. I'll definitely look somewhere else next time.",

He was attentive,  checked in enough but not so much.  His name was David- definitely one of the nicest we've ever had there. Thanks!",

Granted, it's a Saturday afternoon during the lunch rush but it was the little things that just made it.... Meh.  When I walked into the restaurant I seemed to have broken the seating hostess; she just started at us until she realized she should seat us. Our waitress was nice enough when she finally showed up. We had to ask other servers for our silverware, straws, and the remaining parts of our meals. My glass was broken too... Found out the hard way.   Food was dry and boring. Don't order the green beans, for the love of god.",

We assumed that all are the same but this one is not.  We sat at the bar.  It was 8pm so they were not super busy. The ordered a drink that was not the normal standards.  I know this because we have ordered it many times at different locations.  We mention it to the bartender.  That is when things went south. We started noticing that the bartender was more attentive to others at the bar.  We waited for an hour for our food and we started noticing everyone who came in AFTER us started getting their food.  We ask a bus boy for a manager because can clearly see we have annoyed our bartender by calling her out on her drink. Then he tells the another bartender and all of a sudden  everyone is in a panic except our original bartender. She doesn't care.  Even though we sitting there so it's  not like she kept \"missing\" us.  It took 7 mins for a manager to even talk to us claiming they lost our ticket. At this point we wanted corporates number and everyone's name.  The manager said that well they are going to direct you back to us anyways like no one is going to care.  You can't give me my hour  back.  And they moved us like our opinion didn't matter. The managers didn't even want to give us the bartender's name.  It was like they were protecting her.  I called corporate and they said someone would call within 3 days. It took 8 days.  Then corporate called again saying we will be getting a call from the store manager.  GUESS WHAT..they did NOT!!! And it has been a month. Looks like they want to protect their people more than do what is right.  As we were leaving there was a gentleman at the bar and he heard our story.  He asked \"do you think I shouldn't order because you guys didn't get your food?\" We said \" I am sure you will.  You aren't a minority.\" Thanks James Biel, the owner of that store, for not even a call.",

    "text": "I usually enjoy going to Texas Roadhouse and I've been to several in different cities but this one had the worst service of any I've ever visited.  We were in Tempe for a little mini vacation this last weekend and before we headed home we stopped in at this location figuring it was a safe and good bet. We were seated by a hostess who offered us appetizers but then wasn't interested in answering any questions. She seemed to be in a rush to go back to hanging out by the front door and told us our server would be with us shortly. We were left with cool rolls that had clearly been sitting for a while.  20 minutes later no one had stopped by our table and we felt we had waited long enough so we complained to a different hostess who was manning the hostess station. Apparently our first hostess had sat us at a table that wasn't being served at the time but she indicated that they'd be happy to seat us correctly at that point. Since we had to get on the road and we had seen the staff goofing off and not really having an interest in paying much attention to customers while we were waiting we declined and asked to make a complaint to the manager.   We were told that the manager wasn't available and all we could do was walk out and stop at a random drive through to grab a quick burger as we headed out of town.   All things considered we won't be stopping by at this Texas Roadhouse if we're ever in town again. It was a really disappointment and I would strongly recommend against stopping by this place. They had extremely poor service and really don't live up to the Texas Roadhouse name.",

We had to wait 10 to 15 minutes for a table but it wasn't so bad.  We went up to the bar and had a couple margarita, that seems to make things a lot more tolerable. Tara was our server tonight and I think she was awesome. Once again it could have been based on the influence of a margarita, it was a good margarita, but with an additional shot of  tequila how could it be bad?!  Anyway, I wasn't especially hungry and ate less than half of my entree. Thought it tasted pretty good, delivery of the entree was within a reasonable period of time, Tara was consistent and checking in with us just see if everything was okay -bringing water if we needed it, ordering up another cocktail if we wanted one and offered to bring more bread if we wanted it ( oh my God, no more bread ). Meals were tasty, enough to share and all was satisfying. I can suggest you start with a couple margs while you nosh on the peanuts and just hope real hard Tara is your server. Another option, ask for Tara.",

Good steaks can be found at The Keg or Firebirds.  My mate had a chicken salad which was decent.  However, one expects a place with \"Texas\" in the name to have outstanding steaks.  Warning: If you have any peanut allergies stay far away.  There are buckets of peanuts on every table.   Fortunately, there is a small notice posted at the door about this.  By the way, we called for reservations and the hostess said that they do not take any.  She said that we can call to see how long the wait time is.",

Our server brought us piping hot dinner rolls with cinnamon butter.... they are addicting! We ordered the 8oz Sirloin and Rib plate which comes with two sides (we did Ceaser salad and loaded mash potatoes; both were very tasty). We requested the steak Medium and were not disappointed, it was flavorful and juicy, possibly one of the most flavorful steaks I've had from a chain steak house. The ribs were ok, I prefer juicy ribs, these came out a bit burned and dry but our server quickly replaced them when we brought it to her attention. The second time around they were as advertised \"falling off the bone\" and tasty. The drink we were recommended was the Jamaican Cowboy Margarita and it was Amaze! I hate super sweet syrupy margaritas and this one with a salted rim was perfect. I think we'll make this part of our yearly AZ Spring training tradition.",

The body of the steak was a kind of rubbery rare.  Like they cook it sous-vide to serve it.  Definitely wasn't a slow cooked prime rib!  For sure not cooked to order. Ate less than half and gave up.  Brought left overs home thinking for a stir-fry, but i'll just toss it.  lol, best part was the corn & bread.  Used to be a semi-regular at the Mesa location a few years back. Don't know if the location or most likely the economy (& cutting corners) is at fault.... but I've had my fill unfortunately.   Definitely rather spend a few bucks more and go to Long Horn Steakhouse.  Absolutely mouth watering prime rib & steaks.",

We are seated quickly, and started out ok. Stingy on the butter. Ordered food and  waited. And waited. Iced teas were super watery... Which is sad because normally their tea is great. It makes me prediabetic, but it's delicious. They ran out of rolls....Which I'm sorry is like red lobster running out of cheddar bay biscuits. At that point you should closer your doors or offer a discount.   food was  suuuuuuper slow. The order before us I think went back and forth several times with errors our changes our missing items. Yay.  My fillet medallions were cold. Not lukewarm, cold. Rice was not the same as usual either, lacking somehow. Was almost done eating by the time my sweet potato finally arrived, which at least that was hot.   Everyone else was on the same boat. The kids steak bites were mostly that middle piece out of the steak you leave in because if you cut around it you will destroy the steak, but you really don't want it in there because it's unpleasant to chew into. Yeah so must of her steak bites were just stringy tendon y inedibles. Yum.   Overall it was not a great experience. We did get a five dollar discount for my potato, which is better than nothing. I am sure it was just a bad day, but come on. I'm as loyalty member...I'm.a patron.you can do better.",

They have the best dinner rolls, fresh, warm and soft. The steaks are ALL amazing and well seasoned...there's no wrong choice here. Service is awesome! Our server, Natasha, is the best!!! She was mindful of our drinks and often checks on us if we need anything else. We also got a free appetizer if you check in at Yelp. Just present the coupon to the server.

The steamed vegetables that were on the side were very disappointing- they were frozen and not fresh which is not a big deal but they came out mushy.  My partner's ribs were ok but not fall off the bone.  On a positive note, the margarita I had was good.    It wasn't terrible but I wouldn't go back.

I'll admit we came here because we were feeling like cheapskates and wanted to partake in the discounted Early Diner meals (M-F 3:30 to 5:30) where a selected number of items are $9.99 with 2 sides. Not a bad deal! The items vary from steak, chicken, pork or salad. I opted for the 6 oz sirloin with fresh vegetables and green beans. While we waited there was some tasty, pillowy freshly baked bread brought to our table along with some sweet cinnamon butter. There's also a bucket of salted peanuts in shell for those that want a more low carb snack to nosh on while the main entrees arrive.   The 6 oz sirloin with sides wasn't much presentation wise, but it tasted alright, about as much as you would expect for discounted steak lol. I requested it medium and it came out about medium well instead. Despite this being a Texas Roadhouse, it was a non-Texan, smallish portion of steak (It is only 6 oz after all) but was well seasoned at least. The sides were decent. The fresh vegetables consisted of steamed broccoli and carrots, and the green beans were steeped in a smokey bacony broth.   Service was excellent here. Our server was really on top of things about refilling drinks and taking away plates.",

But this location twice has failed. 1st time was 2 years ago and the food was subpar to the Texas roadhouses I'm use too. 2nd time which was today, we called for a phone check in. The hostess stated the wait was about 15 minutes. We got there in 10 minutes and heard my wife's name being called \"Karen party of 5\" we said that was us. Another hostess who was on the phone said that isn't us, it's another group. But that group was a party of 4? So the hostess on the phone said I ain't even check you guys in yet. Then proceeds to give us a fab and tells us it's a 30 min wait. Like what the hell!!!! Over the phone they gave us a confirmation number. The hostess never even listened to what my wife was saying and never got a chance to give the number. I hate to give poor reviews but I was extremely upset with the way the hostess handled us. What's the point of checking in over the phone!!!!!!! Needless to say we took our party of five to Outback!!!!!",

When you walk in you are greeted will a smiling face who is your hostess plus you can see what your steak looks like before it is grilled. (Think of if you were in the grocery store at the meat section). The atmosphere is poppin and people are happy to eat here.   Their dinner rolls are amazing and yes I asked if I could take extra home. Their chicken fried steak is huge so come hungry or you can always share with your special person. The grilled salmon is amazing. Who would think that a place known for steaks can grill a wonderful piece of salmon. It's not dry or bland. It's a must try. I really like the large variety of sides. The mashed potatoes with white gravy is pretty delicious. It reminds me of home with my grandma.   Everyone does look happy to work here. Tables are being cleaned fast and the service is pretty good.   The one down fall when I came here was that the bathroom was a mess. It needed to be checked on and cleaned up. Bummer   I know the cows always say \"eat more chicken\" but why not eat more meat?",

We were seated and we ordered our appetizer right away.  Cactus Blossom who could go wrong it was delicious.  At the same time we ordered the appetizer we ordered our dinners.    So we waited, waited, waited, about an hour and 15 minutes later we made mention to the waiter that 4 tables in our area had gotten their food and that one just left.  He said they lost our ticket. Which was weird because we got our appetizer.    He didn't apologize or anything close to that.    We eventually got our dinners and they were good.    Checking in, we got a free appetizer through Yelp!  We waited and waited because they didn't know how to process it, about 22 minutes because it had a countdown on the coupon.  We finally paid and we were leaving when I asked to talk to a manager and tell them that I think at some point someone should have apologized.   They brought out the waitress that was in the section over.  Lol, I just left.  I must have been asking for to much.    If you've been following along and I know a lot of you have, I always refuse free food.  There are more needy people out there than me and i refuse.    I just wanted someone to say our bad, maybe we'll try harder so that doesn't happen to the next guest, or I'll address it!  Anything!!  When I told her what happened she said \"OK!\".  Classy!",

The portion is huge so if you get that plan to share it with friends or take home leftovers.   I know most people rave about their rolls. They are good, but not so good that I fill up on them before dinner arrives.   It's also a fun place to go for birthday celebrations.

    "text": "My only experience at this location was pretty bad. I've eaten at the Stately location a few times and always felt like Roadhouse was a decent place to get a good steak without spending too much. Now, I'm not so sure. We were in on the 4th hoping to grab a good holiday meal.  I ordered the 12 oz. ribeye, medium-rare and the steak that came out was thin, charred, and far overcooked. Dark grey interior and dry char on the plate when I cut it open. I'm used to ribeye being a thick cut, well marbled cut and this was neither.   They replaced my steak with a NY strip, telling me the ribeye is \"hard to cook\" and the strip is a thicker cut. A while later, the strip came out to pair with my cold sides and empty Arnold Palmer. While it looked to be properly cook, for some reason it sat glistening on the plate like they dumped water on it to add juice. And that's how it tasted. No salt, no pepper; a slab of flavorless meat.   My friends finished eating well before me, and the checks were dropped before I finished \"enjoying\", going me to consume the leather and sawdust that was in my mouth. I was surprised to look at the bill. They didn't comp anything, didn't offer to buy my appetizer, no offer for dessert, and actually charged me more for the strip than my initial order. Good up-sell inattentive server. That was $40 I'll never get back.  Happy 4th of July everyone!",

We had prime rib (medium rare) with a side of rice and sauteed onions & t-bone (medium) with a side of the loaded mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms. Both were absolutely DELISH!!!!

The freshly baked bread so good. we dined there numerous times and the only issue I have is that our high pitched speaking waitress was digging in her teeth in the floor length mirror and then came back to the floor without a beat, serving customers which is a concern health-wise.",

    "text": "I'd like to start off by saying I've been coming to Texas Roadhouse since I was a child. Ordering the same exact thing for about 15 years now. This location has to be the worst location ever. The service is always amazing! Don't get me wrong. But, on my 21st birthday I ordered my first legal drink. They brought it with the check. I ordered it at the beginning...  also tonight I came here and I ordered a steak medium rare. I've been getting my steak medium rare my entire life and I've never had a single issue. But this steak they brought me just... was very very rare. So I said \"I hate to be that person, but....\" then 15-20 minutes later they brought out my same steak that I had cut into, on a burning hot plate. Yeah. They microwaved my steak. I tried my boyfriends. His was soft and delicious and melt in your mouth. Mine was rubbery and disgusting because they put my steak in the microwave. I really don't think I'll be returning to this location. It's a shame because the service is always friendly. But if you're gonna make me wait 20 minutes for a drink and 20 extra minutes when you messed up my food... and not take it off the bill, I won't be returning.",

    "text": "I have always had amazing experiences at the Mesa location and this was my first time visiting the Tempe location.  Did call ahead seating and that worked well.  The rolls were not buttery as much as I like them and had to keep asking for more butter and rolls.  The last time they never came.  Was bummed to find that they don't (or no longer?) have a $3 margarita at all times - just during happy hour.  The ribeye, salad and sweet potato were good.  The biggest negative was that the waitress spilled an entire glass of ice water on me and inside my open purse soon after we were seated.  She was very apologetic and it wasn't a big deal - until the end of the meal when I realized my daughters iphone was in the bottom of my purse still swimming in ice and water. I let her know and she got a manager.  They were both helpful and gave me a gift certificate for two free meals.  (Paid for the two meals we had eaten last night.)  I gave the manager my name and phone number and he gave me his and the owner's business card.  Went home and put the iphone in rice overnight.  It didn't help.  The button is not working consistently and there are problems with the sound.  I am hopeful that this situation will be resolved with the restaurant but also still nervous at this point.  Fingers crossed!!  Update that management was very helpful in buying my daughter a replacement phone.  The experience was simple and straight forward.  Thank you!!!",

Everyone ordered something different so it was fun to see what the food is all about here.    We started with fried dill pickles which were excellent!!!  They were nice and hot (temperature) and tasted great with the Ranch dressing.  I ordered the 6 oz. filet with two sides--baked potato and salad.  The salad came with lots of cut up hard boiled egg.  I really dislike hard boiled eggs, so there I was taking off all of the egg I could take off.  My error because the waitress asked if I wanted everything on it, and I said yes not realizing there was egg on it.  My steak was cooked perfectly.  The other meals (I'm so glad I didn't order!) were:  beef tips (smothered in gravy--ugh!), beef kabobs (chunks of meat looked really small), sirloin steak (too thin for my liking) and grilled chicken with bbq sauce (chicken looked dry).    Service was excellent.  And the waitress didn't add the tip in for the large group which is a good thing (in my opinion) because I always tip 20% or more which I did that night.",

Service was okay, but they didn't bring us any hot rolls until we asked when dinner came. They hand tons of staff standing around not doing much lots of the time.   As for the food I had my usual pork chop dinner, and the chops were well done and very salty, as was the peppercorn sauce that comes with it. Thankfully I like salt, but it was over the top. My wife like her Chicken salad, but it didn't look like anything special. I was shocked the the maybe 3+oz of wine my wife ordered was $8.99. Across the parking lot from this location is Total Wine and More, and I could have got a whole bottle of the same Kendal Jackson for $5.99. Talk about markup!   Most locations I've been to are active, and lively. This one is quite, and slower. There were no birthday call-outs, no line dances, no activity at all. It is a new site, so maybe they'll get better as time goes on.",

    "text": "Texas Roadhouse is usually our favorite place to get steaks.  We love the seasoning and have rarely had any issues at any of the Roadhouses we visited ... except for this year.  Our first bad experience was at the location in Mesa with thin cut steaks.  The 12oz rib eye steak we ordered there was very thin.  Half of the steak was well done and the other half was medium rare.    Then, we discovered the Tempe location and had to give that one a try.  The salads served with dinner are always very good.  We love the stuff they put in it.  It's not just a bowl of lettuce.    This time I order the bone-in ribeye.  This has been my favorite steak in the past.  When delivered it looked like a thick delicious piece of meat.  However, when I cut into it, I discovered it definitely was not medium rare.  It was over cooked and closer to a medium well.  The seasoning was also missing on the steak.  The waiter didn't ask if the steaks were right and we didn't comment.    So, what's up with the Texas Roadhouse restaurants lately?",

    "text": "Like most Texas roadhouses, place is really noisy. In fact my ears were ringing for about a half an hour after we left. But I have to say I had one of the best prime ribs I have ever had in my life. It was cooked to perfection and I could cut it with a fork. Absolutely perfect. I would highly recommend it. I've had their bone in ribeye before, but this is the first time I've tried the prime rib and I'm glad I did. Our bartender was extremely polite and helpful. But I'd be surprised if he still has a voice or could hear anything after his shift. They really need to put some kind of noise dampening material in that place. If they would do that I would give it easily a five star rating",

It's so great to have something to eat the moment you are seated. It's so hard to resist filling up on this amazing bread!  My wife's steak was cooked to perfection and we love the Caesar salad. I tried the ribs last time and could not believe how tender and delicious they were. I have also tried the chicken fried chicken and loved that too.   The servers have been cheerful knowledgeable and proessional. Combine all of this with very reasonable prices and you have a winner. I seriously looked up at my wife after seeing the bill and said \"this can't be right\" cause it was so cheap.  We will definitely make this a new regular spot for us to have dinner. Bravo.",

This place had a super fun atmosphere, and our server was really friendly. I'd definitely recommend coming here for a good time when you're in the mood for some steak.

We love Bailey, she attended and anticipated everything we needed, she was friendly and were all smiles the entire time. We're from Glendale and we drive all the way to this branch for the Firecracker Shrimp, they dont have it at all other Texas Roadhouse near our place and it is something worth driving 45 mins for.   My husband had Rib Eye & Shrimp cooked to perfection. They cooked it the way he wanted which was Medium. I had the Bbq Roasted Half Chicken with Ribs corn and sweet potatoes on the side. Their free dinner rolls are always loved, we get 3 baskets every time and make sure we have something to take home with our left overs. :)  If you happen to be in this town or had to buy something from Ikea, I really recommend going by. Try the Firecracker Shrimp too, because it is amazing! I hope they put that on the regular menu soon so it'll be available in other branches :)",

They would not honor the free ribs as an appetizer.  Argued with the customer and the waiter won!  Its surprising how this chain can vary with the quality of food they serve.  I live in Surprise and do not dine at this location.  TX Road House across from Harkins theater in Peoria offers the same menu but excellent food.  The ribs, road kill, catfish, & pork chops are all excellent choices.  Salads are all ice cold and delicious!  Do check them out.  Love the hot rolls but do ask for regular butter.  The bucket of  peanuts are such an nice touch while waiting for your meal!.  I suggest calling ahead for seating.  They do not take reservations but you will be seated faster if you call in advance!",

Asked if we wanted bread we said yes then took our drink order. Cause you know free bread. Yum. Asked if we wanted any starters we ordered the Fried Pickles. Waited around 10 minutes for the pickles. When they came out she said. Do you still want bread. We already said yes. So we said Yes please. Got our bread and took our order. My mother got there Burger, my grandma got the 9.99 special with the 8oz steak, and i Got the 9.99 texas combo with the 8oz and the shrimp. For the sides i got the salad and the steak fries. My grandma got the baked potato and the side of chili I got my salad before the food came out. It was pretty dry and the croutons were burnt. The rest of the food came out and the server forgot the side of chili. So we asked for her to get it. By the time she brought it out we were already half way done. As we are STILL USING OUR FORK and knifes. She said \"Do you guys want boxes\" we said no thanks, as we are still eating. We take a break as were talking. She comes up and grabs my grandmas plate. She looks at us and says Are you done? We said yes since she basically grabbed everything set up to be taken away. This is 30minutes into our meal. She came back with the check and didnt even offer if we wanted anything else. Didn't ask for refills once. We still tipped 20% and left without causing issues. As were leaving my Grandma tells us that her food was cold. If we would have known that inside we would have complained.  Hopefully Abigail or whatever is having a better day now.",

Me and my husband arrived about 6 p.m. it was pretty busy but we got a table in about 10 minutes regardless and our server was Rachael. ..Besides the food being absolutely amazing...this particular server was just way above our expectations. Regardless of how busy it was she was so attentive made sure that everything was ok and went above and beyond her role as a server. Just because how interactive  and attentive she was we will definitely be coming back more often!! This establishment definitely picks their employees well.",

The ladies room was so dirty the young lady who was sent to clean it said \"this is a mess\". I called the manager on my cell to let him know that the kids shouldn't be playing in the peanut barrel due to its a health code violation and no one is saying anything to them. He told me \" they shouldn't and if it happens I will stop them. lol, smh  I told him, I'm looking at you looking at the kids, he said your in the restaurant?",

Really cares about her job as a manager and makes sure by going around to all tables asking if everything is ok with a smile, like it says on her shirt, I can tell she really loves her job, good job Megan keep it up",

    "text": "My husband LOVE this place for the cheap eats and free peanuts. I acquiesced and agreed to go with him for a belated birthday meal. This location just opened recently and was packed on a Friday night at 5pm. They have deals on drinks for happy hour. Monday - Thursday there are early bird specials that my husband particularly appreciates. But, alas, we went on a Friday night. The salad was actually better than I have had at other locations. Free rolls and peanuts. Hubby had a sirloin, mushrooms,  and a side of ribs. He liked his steak but I thought the ribs had too much sauce. I had The Roadkill chopped steak. It comes with onions, mushrooms, and cheese. The meat was pretty tasty, but it came with a side of grease and salt. The baked potato was dry, a bit disappointing. It is also VERY loud, so be prepared. I would have given this place a 3 star , but my husband loves this place. Did I mention he loves this place? Service is always prompt and friendly.",

    "text": "My wife and I were excited to try the Tempe Texas RH because I'd heard good things about the food from my co-workers and I hadn't been to one of their locations in quite a few years.  The place was hopping and thankfully, we used the call-ahead feature and only had to wait about 5-7 minutes.  Fun atmosphere and the starters (salad/bread) were good.  However, I am a \"steak-guy\" and that's the main reason I was there.  And for that, I was very disappointed.  My ribeye was tough to chew - so much so that I didn't even continue eating it after 3 bites.  Anyone who knows me will attest that I love steak and it's rare that I meet one that I don't like...especially at a steakhouse.  But this one was rubbery/dry/tough.  Our server (who was average at best) didn't really apologize, but looked at me suspiciously.   She said the manager would come over to talk to our table, but that didn't happen.  Fortunately, they took my steak off of our bill.  That was appreciated, but I would have much preferred my evening if I had paid for and eaten a great steak.",
