    "text": "Yum, yum, yum!! This is such a great little spot, plus it's walking distance from my house (incentive to drink more wine I think)! These guys know what they are doing and I am so happy to see the owners have more success after Portlands closed.   The menu has a nice selection of options, with flat breads taking up a good chunk of it. I've had many of them, most recently The Earl. Dang, that was one spicy flat bread but totally delicious. Their Ashland salad is quite yummy (you can't go wrong with bacon) and I also really like to get their roasted veggies too. The burrata is also delicious, I just wish there was more it to devour. I've also heard good things about the lasagna and green chile pork.   They also have a nice selection of wines and beers with the waiters all being pretty knowledgeable in guiding you to a good glass. The food is always out quick, servers always friendly, plus the decor is just adorable. I love the bathrooms (weird to say but check them out and you'll agree :D).",

    "text": "First time visiting this place after hearing about it for months. For ambiance, I would give this 5 stars. It's small, intimate and has a downtown charm to it. I would add that it's self-seating and we arrived at 7pm on a Friday night. We got a table right away but it was at the bar where my wife and I were outside and our 2 friends were across from us but inside. Still kinda fun!  The food was perfect. We built a meat and cheese board and they have great options, very comparable to Postino, if not better. We also ordered the Italian combo flatbread which was perfect. Their wine list is better than Postino and I had the Malbec. For dessert, my wife had the gelato with dulce flavoring and it was divine. I ordered the tiramisu. They only had one slice left (this was around 8:30pm on a Friday night so slightly disappointing). I share that because my friend's husband wanted one too. We ended up sharing it and our server added a candle after we all joked about the two of us sharing an intimate slice of tiramisu.   This will be a regular spot for ushering forward. It is better than Postino (with way better parking too) but not as close to us. But very worth the drive. We didn't even play corn hole but it was readily available!",

Food was tasty, smaller than normal portions for the price, however we were more upset about the service.  When asked if we could move an unoccupied table next to ours to have more room for our party of eight, we were told NO!  Would like to mention that no other group came to that table while we were there and our party of eight sat at the tiny table placing our food on bar stools since we didn't have enough room.  We would have ordered more food if we had a place to put it.",

    "text": "This place is fantastic!! It's a hidden gem in downtown Phoenix, and I'll definitely be back again and again after my experience this evening. Unreservedly, I give Oven and Vine five stars!!   The previous owners of Portland's started this place, so I had high expectations before eating here. Both owners were working at the restaurant when I went. Luckily, their attention to quality and investment in the restaurant shows in both the menu and their staff.   We had the braised beef and the Italian flatbread, and we then finished the meal off with some imported tiramisu. The beef was marinated in a light tomato stew for several hours and was incredibly tender. Fingerling potatoes accompanied the beef and were expertly roasted. The bread (including the flatbread) was fresh and delicious; it is homemade and, as a plus, completely vegan. In fact, everything tasted like it had been made that day.   The tiramisu, although imported from Italy, was carefully selected by the restaurant and the best I had ever had. Important to note: the tiramisu was HUGE- definitely a shareable dessert if you have more than one person!  Of exceptional note was the service. Finding great customer service is important to me, and unfortunately, it seems hard to come by these days. Not at Oven and Vine. Our waiter, Ronnie, made us feel like we were longtime friends of the restaurant. In choosing a bottle of wine, he brought us out some generous tastings to help us in making a decision. It was clear that he took great pride in the restaurant. The Pinot noir (Sharecropper's) we settled on was great!   All in all, Ronnie's enthusiasm was infectious and made the experience that much better. :)   On a final note, the building is architecturally cool and close to rollover donuts, which is also an awesome place. Oven and Vine was working on developing the outside area, and I look forward to seeing how that turns out. There are some games and places to sit and enjoy wine.   I will definitely be back again and cannot recommend this place enough!!",

We went here on a Saturday night and the place was empty... our server said the hot nights are Monday-Friday (not surprising since it's a downtown establishment). The prices were on the higher end of reasonable, but if you are looking to splurge a bit on a date night then you will not be disappointed. I tried a local wine from Camp Verde that was very smooth, and my boyfriend tried the space dust beer. We then split the special of the day which was a spicy southern pasta dish, and one of the flat breads. All of the food was delicious and the restaurant is darling. We will definitely be back again.",

Came early hours, 3ish- so can't speak to wait time or ease of getting seat during later hours.  Happy Hour from 11-6, nice. Wish it was in my neighborhood.

Every dish is baked in the huge brick oven you see in the kitchen. Simple but ingenious.   I definitely recommend that you stop in if you're in the phoenix area.

This consists of sandwiches, flatbread, salads, and a smattering of hot entrees.  The sandwiches are good with fresh ingredients.  We also had the green chili pork.  We were surprised to see that this was more of a stew rather than a dry dish.  It was pretty good, though a tinge of sweet flavor slightly detracted from what I consider to be a savory dish.  The cheese/meat plates are a tasty treat.  The seating area is small.  Wasn't too crowded during our lunch hour, though I can imagine it might be full for dinner.  The small size also makes the ambience loud if other tables are having heated conversations.  Might not be good for an early date place.  Price is on the higher end, though the downtown location sometimes makes this inevitable.",

He ended up being our server. I believe his name is Austin. He was a really good server to us, very involved with our table.

    "text": "First off, this is a fantastic space.  An old 1940's home that has been repurposed into a fun, eclectic neighborhood haunt.  The old Vaughn residence actually contains two restaurant spaces.  The south section is an indoor seating area & coffee spot for Rollover Doughnuts (the doughnut kiosk itself is right next door), while the north section of the building is devoted to Oven & Vine.  I'd been here before for Rollover, but not Oven & Vine.  Remember the old Portland's restaurant on Central & Portland?  Well, after that operation shut down the owners moved into this space instead.  Admittedly part of my delay in coming here was specifically because I wasn't a huge fan of Portland's.  The restaurant location was awesome, but the food was overpriced for what it was and the decor just didn't mesh well with the neighborhood (in my opinion).  In Oven & Vine, the old Portland's owners now have not only a more intimate space, but one that allows them to be more creative too.  I decided to give it a try during Happy Hour on a Tuesday.  When I walked in the main entrance (northwest corner of the building by the way), I was immediately greeted warmly by the bartender up front.  On your left is the bar with the beer and wine selection as well as a chalkboard listing the wine of the day.  On your right is the sitdown area which is evenly split between high top tables and sit down tables, separated by an open wall with more high top seating in the middle.  The windows on the east side of the building can be opened up to the outside with additional bar seating and a very pleasant looking pocket park with adirondack chairs and even a game of corn hole.  Today it was 110 outside so the windows thankfully were shut.  You seat yourself where ever here as there's no host or hostess.  I grabbed a spot at the bar this go around (which offers a great view of the open kitchen).  For happy hour its $2 off wine glasses, $1 off draft beers, and $1 off apps.  I started off with a glass of their Force of Nature Red Syrah Blend.  I'm a Syrah fan so this suited me quite nicely.  The Au Gratin Potato appetizer seemed to be a popular pick among some of the Yelpers so I went with that as my appetizer.  The presentation resembled that of a pastry and was delicious from the first bite.  They blend of bunch of different cheeses into this rendition and the potatoes were super creamy but firm.  Thumbs up for this starter.  Their main dishes primarily consist of flatbreads so I decided to go with the Prosciutto Pesto.  Liberal amount of pesto sauce covered with mozzarella and pieces of prosciutto.  Another tasty creation and I loved the pesto, but have to admit I would've liked a little more prosciutto.  There was enough to let you know it was there, but just barely.  For dessert, I went with their housemade chocolate torte.  It was certainly rich and dense as their menu advertised, though perhaps a tad dry.  I've had excellent chocolate tortes elsewhere and while this one certainly had chocolate flavor in abundance, it wasn't as creamy on the inside as I've had elsewhere.  Still, a pretty enjoyable dish.  Total cost for the wine, the food, tax, and tip came to about $40.  Pricey?  Perhaps a dollar here or there.  Though I know Oven & Vine locally sources most of their ingredients so I know there's a premium for that.  On the whole, I was pretty impressed.  The owners of Portland's have improved a bit on their food menu and have chosen a much better space from which to showcase it.  During the non-summer months I would absolutely come here for some drinks and some corn hole on the lawn.  Most of what Oven & Vine brings to the table isn't necessarily new or something you wouldn't find elsewhere, but they deliver it in a casual, welcoming environment that I feel almost anyone would enjoy.  Historical preservation with a personality.  Who knew?",

Nothing is bad.... Nothing at all.   1) the food is fantastic, everything on the menu is great... I know... I've had each item.  2) the beer and wine selection is top-notch. The beers are not your normal run of the mill, but craft brewery small batch and specialties. The wine is great and the selections are plentiful.  3) the atmosphere is great with downtempo music in the background, open view kitchen and great outdoor area for the cooler days and nights.   Most importantly.... 4) the staff are amazing, friendly, and know their regulars. Dylan and Michelle are amazing and have a great concept that is just perfect.   It's not uncommon for them to get really busy and the staff is small... So be patient.",

We started with the fresh bread and while normally I balk at charging for things that many places give away for free, the $3 is nominal for the yummy yeasty experience.  (Do it.)  Ask for extra olive oil and balsamic as you'll likely need it.  Service was excellent and when I requested the check shortly after our meals arrived, our waiter was on the ball with cashing us out and dropping off boxes.    A directional note: take Central to Vernon because if you try to cross Vernon from the west, there's a gate and you'll have to go up to Thomas for a do-over.",

    "text": "Went here for my birthday last week. It was fantastic.  Atmosphere was very relaxed and service was excellent.  Would definitely like to come back and check out the patio area sometime. ( We sat inside.)  The converted house definitely lends itself to a feeling of laid-back coziness.   For dinner we started with the burrata. The cheese was delicious and well seasoned and the homemade bread was amazing - warm, crusty and coated in olive oil and rosemary.   Next we had the garden salad, which was  a little plain.  Though the greens and tomatoes were nice and fresh,  we  didn't receive any cucumbers.  Luckily the parmesan, pepper corn dressing rescued the dish with some excellent flavors.   For the main course my girlfriend and I split the green chili pork with potatoes au gratin.  The chili was as good as anything I've had in new Mexico but the real standout were  the potatoes.  Thinly sliced and layered with cheese and cream they're almost like a pavre.  They were excellent by themselves and even better paired with the chili.   To drink my girlfriend had a glass of pinot grigio while I had the funkwerks saison.  There were plenty more choices for wine and beer and it seemed like they had a full bar.  Definitely something  for everyone here.  I'll see what photos I have and upload them along with this review. Definitely pleased with my experience.  I'd recommend Oven+Vine to anyone looking for a casual meal.  I'll be back to try out the Flatbread  eventually!",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to try something new last Friday and headed here.   Initial impression- super cute! Nice grassy area out front with bags and giant jenga. It was raining the night we went, but in the future, the outside area would be a great place to enjoy some drinks and games.  When we walked in, a waitress let us know it was open seating. I'm not too big on the community table concept, and the only space left was at the community table in the middle, but it ended up being okay.  Our waiter was pretty quick with taking our orders and bringing our drinks. I ordered the green chili with an gratin potatoes and my husband got a flatbread. Unfortunately, it was downhill from there. My meal came out 45 minutes later, and my husband's came out almost one hour later.   During the wait, the waiter stopped by once or twice to see if we needed refills but made no comment about the delay. When he brought my food out, he told my husband there was several flatbreads in the oven and his would be right out. Then about 5 minutes later, another waiter came by with a comped order of bread and olive oil. It was a nice thought but too little too late. How about brining me something to munch on while I'm waiting, not after I get my food? Also, the bread wasn't that great. I'm glad we didn't pay $3 for that. When my husband's food finally came out, we got a half hearted apology.  Food wise, I liked my green chili but thought the potatoes were bland. My husband like his flatbread, but I thought it was too soggy.   With our meals, one beer, one glass of wine, the night ended up being over $50. Considering the service we received, I feel that's quite a bit of money.  I can deal with delays, but I expect the waiter to a) acknowledge it while I'm waiting and b) make an honest apology or offer some kind of discount. I'm  hesitant to go back any time soon but I might give it another shot in the future.  And on a random note, what's with the bathrooms? You know how you go to a cheesy steak house and instead of just saying \"women\" and \"men\" on the door it says something stupid like \"cowgirls\" and \"cowboys\"? Here, they went with a Flintstone theme and the bathrooms are marked \"Pebbles\" and \"BamBam\". How that ties into the restaurant at all, I have no idea.",

They even helped us with directions to the airport. We will definitely stop by again on our next trip to Phoenix!",

We ended up there on the night of Phoenix's epic hurricane (9/27/14 I think), because our power was out. They were bursting at the seams with other folks in our same situation and the camaraderie reminded me a little of the hurricane parties we used to have in Key West. We grabbed seats at the outdoor bar and munched on olives, bread, and basically everything available on the charcuterie  plate. It was all wonderful. The wine selection is compact but every one we tried was amazing. Considering how insane the entire city was that night, the staff was gracious and efficient. Although we're anxious to go back on a less eventful evening, it was a wonderful adventure and made for a very fun memory.",

It's not all that big, so the tables are right on top of each other, so you will hear every conversation that is happening if you are sandwiched between a few tables like we were.  I'm not sure I wanted to hear some of the topics I got an earful on, but this is how they roll here.  It is LOUD in this place.  The lady at the bar with the witches cackle was particularly annoying.  Happy when her embarrassed date, rescued us all and drug her wine quenched ass out the door...Back to the food - Had the Italian salad - it was chock full of all things Italian (salami, Italian meats, etc) plus plenty of get your veggie on, so it was good.  Staying with the theme, I ordered the Italian flatbread.  It's a decent 6 slice thin pizza, with many of the same toppings found on the salad.  I have to say one of the best things about this place is the smell of them making the flatbread pizzas.  Really great sense memory as you can't wait for your pizza to arrive.  It was also pretty good.  I wasn't able to finish the last piece, but if I was really hungry, I could have easily polished this off.  So, a little hit (food) and a little miss (noisy and not very intimate for dinner).  Worth a try.  If I come back to Phoenix, it wouldn't be on my repeat list.",

I think there are 2 different entrances? The door that says \"inside\" on the front is an extension of the coffee shop and is a sort of communal chill spot. We peeked inside and there were a few people working on their laptops...very quiet. The entrance to o+v we took was the third door down on the east facing side of the building. Upon entering o+v we were told we could take a seat anywhere. Great atmosphere and delicious food. My friend and I ordered the bread per recommendations read on yelp and we each got a flat bread. Soooo good. And the flat breads are a good size, nice portion. I got the prosciutto and pesto and my friend got the earl. The jalapenos on the earl were spicy! But good! The burn was real though. We had to ask if they had ranch....we were worried if that would be insulting haha. But they had a sauce similar to ranch that was ranch like but not? Our waitress said its better than ranch and it was really yummy, definitely cooled our mouths from the spice. Great place, definitely recommend.",

The location was a little difficult to find especially in the dark, but the private parking lot was spacious and led up to a restaurant space that looked like a large house. I was intrigued. After we found a spot on some adirondack chairs on the patio, we ordered a bottle of the 13 Celsius Sauvignon Blanc and some charcuterie and seasonal veggies. The wine was delicious and perfect for a warm fall evening outside. The charcuterie assortment we ordered which consisted Manchego, Burrata, Gorgonzola Blue and the Genoa Salami definitely hit the spot and included plenty of each to share. The veggies were also delicious although it did remind me of an Asian stir fry included snap peas, beets, garlic, zucchini, and roasted peppers. To top off the evening, the service was perfect! We had a girl that was training, but she seemed knowledgeable and was not overbearing while checking in. I would definitely recommend this quaint restaurant and return again!",

I had the spare ribs for my entree. The meat literally fell off of the bone. Our starter was a shared caprese salad, with homemade mozzarella, fresh basil and a sliced beefsteak tomato drizzled with oil and balsamic vinegar. It was so refreshing that I would have been fine eating that as my entree! My only beef I have with Oven and Vine, at least for lunch, is that every entree on the menu, with the exception of the spare ribs, is spicy, and I don't like to feel like my mouth is burning when I eat! But that's just me. I know that in this part of the country most people love spicy food! But it does not keep me from going back regularly! I highly recommend it!",

    "text": "I came to Oven + Vine with friends who live in Phoenix. I'd tasked them with picking a restaurant because I don't really understand Yelp in this town. Last time I was here, we went to a place with a 5-star average that was decent enough, but without atmosphere, in a sterile mall. I was happy to see that Oven + Vine was less depressing, a cute spot with a hipster vibe, a nice oasis for a visiting Angeleno.  We went for dinner on a Thursday night and the place was vibrant and busy, with one of the youngest crowds I've come across in Phoenix (average age in the 30s, maybe even 20s!). The restaurant was in a building that looked like someone's house, complete with a lovely yard patio. We ate inside, and I enjoyed the homey, comfortable feel of the place. Service was great, too. Everything about this meal was just pleasant and easy.  The draft list was solid. I drank a tall glass of the Four Peaks Kilt Lifter, which has become my go-to when-in-Phoenix beer. I also tried some of the Two Brothers North Wind imperial stout, which was fantastic. Prices were reasonable, too. The Kilt Lifter was $5, not bad for a sit-down dinner beer.  I wasn't terribly hungry when I showed up for dinner--I'd been at a conference event with free tacos, and I have no will power--but I ordered the baked rigatoni and ate most of it anyway. It was quite tasty, the pasta made with house marinara sauce and herbed ricotta cheese then topped with mozzarella. Like most baked pastas, the rigatoni was slightly dry here and there, but it was mostly just satisfying. I added locally made Schreiner's sausage for $2, and it was well worthwhile. I also took a sliver of my friend's Italian combo flatbread, and this was a good piece of pseudo-pizza, the doughy bread topped with thin-sliced prosciutto, Schreiner's sausage, sopressata, mozzarella, and tomato sauce. I wouldn't say the food was outstanding overall, but it was pretty good and well priced--my pasta was $11 including the sausage.  I liked Oven + Vine and would probably come often if I lived in Phoenix. I had a great time with my friends--we hung out for a couple of hours, and it was very fun and relaxing. The food and drink were solid and affordable, and the place just had a good vibe. I haven't found too many restaurants in town that check all those boxes.",

You just can't resist the charm of the place, the people, and of course the delish carbs!!! It's everything everyone is gushing about. A local neighborhood spot tucked behind the busyness of Central but quaint enough to be your escape. You walk in and it's like being invited over for dinner. And it's tough, you get so cozy you want to stay for a very very long time. I love sitting at the bar, both inside and out, or you can grab a lawn chair and play the games outside. Once the weather coaxes you in, definitely plant yourself by the fireplace.  I can't really pick any one item that's my fave because the menu appeals to any taste bud. I do love the flatbread, the whole smorgasbord that they offer, to go with the beers on tap. The green chili pork with a side of potato au gratin...need I say more. And to add to the indulgence, have the chocolate gelato. One scoop is enough...that coming from the biggest sweet tooth ever. Trust me, it's going to leave you with a happy face happy belly all night long and for days until you come back. What's wrong with that?",

There's an outside patio for fun times (games too?) and a small but lively interior that beckons you to sit back, order a nice glass of red and chow down on some amazing and brick-oven loved dishes.  I had the mozarella pesto flatbread, a hearty portion of cheesy, grilled carb-heavy grill bread that was absolutely divine.   My beau had the baked rigatoni with sausage and he really enjoyed it. A glass of wine each, a roasted veggie salad to share and we enjoyed it all for under $50 with tax.   Definitely a keeper.",

I should have ordered the flatbread, which is what others around us were ordering and it smelled and looked amazing. I will definitely return and try the flatbread!   They have corn hole & giant jenga in the outdoor patio. Seating is first come first serve, but we were able to find seating for our small group. Wouldn't recommend it if you have a larger party, since it is a smaller restaurant with tables for 2 or 4. Excellent service & very speedy!",

She advised us that we can have a seat at any available table.   We agreed on the table inside. The place was so cozy and has such a nice atmosphere. Both of us being born and raised in Europe, this kind of place made as feel just like home. Our server even had European roots. Funny, ha?   He was super cool. Very welcoming and informative. He explained the menu, including the Happy Hour one. Also, he made sure to check on us during our entire stay.   We \"obviously\" ordered some wine and some of their extremely delicious starters.  Everything was great. Food was delicious and when it comes to wine, I never had  one I did not like :)   There is also patio outside and with beautiful Arizona weather, I can't think of a better way to go.

    "text": "I just read a Yelp review on this place wherein the author argued with the staff about whether the pizza had fresh mozzarella. I finally had the chance to eat here, and if I could sum it up in one sentence, it would be as follows: \"There is no way in hell that was fresh mozzarella.\"  That's really all there is to it.  Honestly, I had high expectations going into this place. I'm a sucker for old buildings that are converted into restaurants. I also like restaurants that are not part of the Sam Fox Galactic Empire. This should have been a slam dunk.  The flatbread crust (how hip of them to call it a flatbread instead of pizza!) has all the depth and texture of a piece of stale pita bread. The sauce was bland. We have already discussed the cheese. This is basically the Peter Piper Pizza of \"artisan\" pizza.  The oven had a door on it. A door! One cannot cook a pizza in a properly heated oven if it has a door on it.  I'm pretty sure they got their recipes and cooking techniques from an internet forum for Caucasian stay-at-home moms in Middle America.  Besides the mediocrity of the pizza (excuse me, \"flatbread\"), the other problem I had with this place is that it took about ten minutes before the server/bartender asked me if perhaps I would like some food, or something. Maybe it's the norm for people to come here and not eat. In retrospect, maybe they're onto something.  But hey, it's a cool space! I'll bet Sam Fox is pissed they stole his concept (\"mediocre {TYPE OF CUISINE} in a hip space\").",

It took a long time for the wait staff to get our drink orders, and then an even longer time to get our food orders, but once we settled in they took good care of us. I can't really blame them too much for the delay as there were 20 of us, and since they don't take reservations and we arrived in the middle of a bustling happy hour, it took us awhile to find enough seating spread across multiple tables. Still, it would've been nice if they'd taken our drink orders right away so that we could have something to nurse while we waited for our food.  In any case, our server was very attentive, friendly, and couldn't have been more helpful.   We ordered a wide selection of appetizers and entrees, although quite a few of us stuck to salads since we had had plenty to eat at the conference. I had the charcuterie, opting for the Manchego, Fontina and the Prosciutto Rustico, which also came with a small bowl of smoked almonds. It was a lovely, delicate dish, perfectly proportioned for those seeking a light but filling meal. My colleague who ordered the Ashland Salad raved about it as well.   We finished up by splitting Claire's Chocolate Torte, a luscious dessert fit for two hungry diners or even 3-4 light eaters. Not too sweet, not too rich, so a fitting end to a delicious meal.",

The waitstaff did not seem to mind how we went on and on eating up our Prosciutto Rustico, Manchego and Burrata Mozzarella platter with fresh baked bread.  And the beer went well with everything. There wasn't a bad choice on the list.  But oh what a night to live again because for just a minute life was as simple and delicious as the food that was sitting on our plate.",

    "text": "(Lyrics - Cake - Short Skirt/Long Jacket)  I want some wine with blend like a diamond I want some wine that tastes the best I want some wine with a crispy cut And bold and texture of elegants  I want a wine with the right allocations That is red and buttery and sharp as a tack I'm playing with my winery, I'm putting up my Yelp I'm touring the facility and trying our snacks  I want some wine at the Oven &.....long Vine  Oven + Vine is was a tad bit hard to find cause it's tucked away in a hiding spot.  However, once discovered this quaint little restaurant is totally one of the cutest.  It's a hybrid of Postinos and The Yard I think.  I came here with a friend one night and started with a bottle of wine.  For the food with shared their Ashland Salad, which came with Spinach, roasted onions, parmesan cheese, and bacon.    Overall, a solid start to wet our palates.  Then again what doesn't go well with bacon!  For our entree we ordered their Margarita pizza on flatbread.  The bread was doughy, but I find their tomato sauce very lightly added.  I kind of like mines heavy with lots of fresh leaves of basil to add the aroma.  The star of the night for me was their house made bread which I totally recommend.  Fresh baked and crusted on the outside while the inner bread was soft as a pillow and melted in your mouth!    In the end, Oven + Vine is totally worth a visit.  An older home renovated into a restaurant is always cool and their patio is literally a backyard with an opening to a bar which we sat at.  I rated this place a 3 star for their food cause I thought it was okay (but do get their bread!).  Service was attentive and tops! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "Its a little house from way back when tucked away on Vernon. It makes for a great date night , its one of those intimate settings, or in real estate speak, the place is very cozy. The setting is great for a date night is basically what I am getting at. It is not stuffy but a nice warm place to enjoy a nice quiet meal.   They have a good selection of vegetarian and vegan options which is always a plus in my book and a pretty good selection of beers including a rotating beer selection. When the weather is permitting they do have an outdoor patio area where you can play cornhole (not sure why they came up with that name !) and other lawn games. So if you were with friends it could be a nice place to just grab that post work beer outside.   Having said that it does get busy because it is a small-ish place and so there may be a wait or you can get lucky like we did and get seated in 5 minutes. The food is awesome and I pretty much destroyed whatever it was that came out. Also the au gratin potatoes are addictive, so don't ever get those, you've been warned !",

The first thing you notice is the ambience. It feels great here, very cozy yet modern and hip. It's a small location, with a great outdoors area featuring string lights and lawn games.  Our waiter was very helpful. He was relaxed and informative with the perfect amount of attention and he guided us to some great choices. We shared the roasted veggies salad first. It was simple but delicious and very fresh tasting. The veggies were cooked very nicely. The dish was served with a simple olive oil based sauce and I really enjoyed it.   We also got the green chili chicken with a side of au grauten potatoes. It was amazing! So flavorful, so full of meat and spice! It's essentially a stew, but its very lite for a stew - I didn't feel weighed down by it. Be warned though, it was spicy! Like it was borderline too spicy, which I loved. But they do warn you about that when you order. Potatoes were so good. I'll get them again.  Do yourself a favor and go!",

    "text": "Oven + Vine is a fabulous new addition to the Phoenix dining scene.  It's tucked away in a renovated 1940's house, and totally worth seeking out... I did so last weekend on a date night with my husband and we had a lovely meal.  They don't take reservations, so I was nervous that on a Saturday night, there would be a wait... Luckily, that wasn't the case.  We were welcomed by several staff members and told to sit down where ever we wanted.  I loved the warm but casual vibe.    Austin was our server and was attentive and patient as we mulled over the menu and decided what to order... We ended up staring off with a bottle of the \"Force of Nature\" red wine and put in an order for the burrata, roasted mushrooms, and seasonal vegetable starters.  It was a gorgeous evening, so we took our glasses of wine outside and played a few games of cornhole before the food arrived.  (I won by the way!)  Love that they have a gorgeous patio, bar, lawn games, etc...  We then headed back in and enjoyed all of our starters and then ended up ordering the Green Chili Chicken with potatoes as an entree to share.  It's worth noting that the burrata, mushrooms, and chicken all come with bread, and the bread is homemade and very addictive.  Needless to say we had more than enough food!  We look forward to returning to this moderately priced, locally owned establishment, perhaps for brunch or lunch sometime.  Or even just for a charcuterie board, bottle of wine, and another game of cornhole!",

Service was pretty good but this restaurant is small and it seemed that they had just got done with a rush. Wine selection was great!  Menu is small but accommodating. Had a salad and the brisket/ pot roast which was super yummy. The Mediterranean salad was ok. Was just missing something. Chocolate dessert was fabulous! Will be back to try the pasta which everyone was eating.",

There were five of us so there wasn't a table open to fit us, however the waiter quickly pushed some tables over to accommodate.  I started with the La Cumbre Elevated IPA and my wife ordered the Lemonade vodka drink as we were pleasantly surprised that did have liquor. As we were concerned that it was Beer and Wine only.   We ordered the fresh baked bread and it was delicious.  Super soft and plenty flavor, and the scalloped potatoes that were the perfect amount of cheese.  We both ordered the baked Rigatoni, however mine was with the schreiner's sausage.  They came out of the oven super hot, but once they were no longer of nuclear temperature it was delicious.  I finished the night with a Mable Brewery Cholo Stout.",

They have a simple modern decor on the inside with a semi-open kitchen.   Food: Only had the Bacontarian and the Italian sandwiches, both with roasted chicken.  The Bacontarian was basically a BLT but the bacon used was thick cut.  There was a zesty jalapeno remoulade on the sandwich but the bacon over powered it.  The Italian used a sweet sopressata that was balanced out with the roasted red peppers.  Both sandwiches had roasted chicken added to them but it didn't help or hinder the flavor of the sandwiches.  The bread used on both sandwiches was home made, similar to a ciabatta.  Service: It was a little slow, looked like only one server was working at the time(During Lunch)   The server was friendly though and the food was timely.  Overall: Wonderful little place with good food and a small but decent selection of beer.  Would definitely recommend for small group outings or an intimate date night.",

It was truly like being over at a friend's house, enjoying great people and amazing food.   The menu is not overwhelming, which I enjoy. With the brain that I have, more than 25-30 options send me into a frenzy. But, this menu was perfect.   The waiter recommended the Bacon-Tarian. He almost had me...but I went for the Baked Rigatoni. It was great, only thing that it needed was a dash of salt and pepper. The serving size was just enough to be satisfied and not super full.   I wasn't too pleased with speed of service, as the restaurant wasn't packed. However, I'd much rather have slow but phenomenal service, than fast subpar service.   For the portion sizes, the pricing is spot on. I'm anxious to go back, but next time it will be in the evening. From the outside set up, I'm sure it won't disappoint.",

The flatbread had an intriguing crust with quality toppings; the salad was of quality ingredients; the vegetable rigatoni was worth coming back for; the braised beef was tender and tasty; we had a second order of fresh baked bread; but the potatoes stole the show. Candidate for Best Ever, reminiscent of Rosti. The whole experience was notably Continental.",

    "text": "Stopped in here recently for lunch - Oven and Vine sits behind my absolutely favorite coffee place (Shine).  My connection was coincidental, as I'm involve with a t-shirt business, and Dylan the owner had come by for some t-shirts recently.  During conversation, I realized that Dylan used to run Portland's restaurant on 1st and Portland, which closed a while back.  That was a posh high end place that made for an awesome setting for business lunches.  Oven and Vine is a different vibe altogether, and I love it.  Much more approachable in a come as you are kind of way, and very friendly and easy going.  The menu is short and sweet, but has a good variety.  I was in for a light lunch, so ordered the Italian Salad, and another buddy ordered the green chili chicken.  The salad was awesome!  And the lunch buddy said the green chili chicken was as well.  Great place to hang out - good casual laid back vibe, of a seat yourself and get comfortable sort.  And I love the venue and location - I'm really drawn in by this historic estate pool house and long house setup that houses both Shine and Oven and Vine.  Highly recommended!  And you have to keep in mind this is all happening in a long house of a long-gone historic estate.",

I had the baked manicotti with sausage and my wife had rigatoni with sausage.  We enjoyed our meal and look forward to trying a few more dishes soon!  Only thing that was foreign was that you have to pay for warm bread.  Will definitely be back...with friends!",

The red headed waitress showed up 15 minutes after my arrival, and asked if I wanted anything to eat. I mentioned that first I would like a glass of water, and she responded that she had brought 7 glasses of water to the table. My friends scrambled to find the extra untouched, lukewarm glass of water,and I ordered my food. My friends meals arrived, and as they were finishing my 4 pre cut ribs and a 3\"x3\" square of au gratins was served. The ribs were dry and undercooked.  The waitresses never came back, so I was unable to ask for some barbecue sauce. She did eventually show up to give everyone their bills, including mine while I was still eating. She never asked if anyone wanted anything else. What a waste of time and money.",

The ambiance is cozy and inviting, and as they continue to develop the space it will only get better!     My friend had the grilled vegetable salad and I had the proscuitto and pesto flatbread - both quite delicious!  The salad came without the chicken on it that my friend had ordered, and to make up for it we were given the most delicious tiramisu for dessert... didn't have to twist our arms much to take that!     Perfect place for lunch as the service was quick, the prices were reasonable and the food was fabulous!

After choosing our seats we both ordered Hoegaardens which were a fantastic deal at $4 a pint. My husband chose the sopressata & olive flatbread, and I had  the baked vegetable pesto. My husband's flatbread was delicious, the mozzarella was fresh and creamy, the sauce was flavorful and the olives and sopressata added just enough salt. My baked pasta was good, but fell a little short. I loved how there were a ton of perfectly cooked vegetables in the dish. However the pesto was a little too oily and formed a pool at the bottom of the bowl. It was also a little too bland, nothing a little extra parmesan couldn't fix though. My dish was served with freshly baked bread which was quite good, I used it to sop up the extra oil, so the oily sauce came into good use. I will definitely return and would love to try more of the menu.",

The dining room looks like you are eating in someone's living room, which is great, and the decor is a mix of old and modern. They have many beers on tap and a good happy hour I would like to check out in the near future. The food was solid. The husband and I split the baked rigatoni and the margherita flatbread. The rigatoni was good, but tasted a bit like something you could make at home. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it was really fresh and tasty, but it makes it harder to go to a restaurant to get it (unless you don't cook, in which case it's great!). The rigatoni came with delicious fresh baked bread. It was a nice amount of food for the small price tag (9$). The flatbread was very good. It had a lot of fresh basil and was flavorful. It was also large, we even took some home (and it was good the next day!). I would definitely come here for the flatbread again. And did I see that it was gluten free? I don't even know how they did that... overall, this place was very good, I will be back!",

    "text": "Wow. Not in a good way. My first Yelp review ever. Rudest treatment at a restaurant ever. And from my \"Cheers\" -- breaks my heart.   I live across the street and come here often. What happened the other night is shocking to me. I gave myself a couple days to think about it before posting this review, but this is just not cool. My server, Austin, made three round trips past my table after I wanted to order a second glass of wine and my glass was empty. No worries, but the second trip he went to the bar and checked his phone before getting water for the table behind me. The third trip he delivered the water, went past me, and was showing someone else his phone at the kitchen counter. I was sitting right across from the bar and called out \"Austin!\" He acknowledged me, but didn't come to my table. After waiting for a while, I decided to leave and told Austin never mind.  While paying my bill with the owner, Austin came by and said maybe yelling at him wasn't the best way to get service. I said I didn't \"yell at\" him, I just called out his name to get his attention because he had walked by three times and was on his phone. He said I did too yell at him, that I was rude and disrespectful -- and I knew it -- and that my wine glass was never empty. I just said \"Wow.\"  Michelle -- the owner -- was right there. She counted out my change and said \"thank you.\" I looked at her and asked, \"That's it?\" Apparently it was, because all she said was, \"I don't know what's going on here.\" Except she heard exactly what Austin said to me and how he said it.   Austin, WTF? You have waited on me many times. I have brought you lemon bars. What made you decide that calling your name made me a bitch queen \"yelling at\" you? Michelle, you were right there. If it is acceptable to you for your employees to talk to customers this way, well let other customers be your employees' punching bags. I give plenty of allowance for \"things happen,\" but not for in-your-face rudeness without no hint of apology. I vote with my wallet, as we all should when confronted with businesses that treat us this way.   Let me be clear: this experience was one star, not representative of the many good 4 or 5 star experiences I've had there. But this just illustrates that it only takes one horrible experience to wipe out many good experiences.   Not my \"Cheers\" any more. Bummer.",

I ordered the rigatoni and my friend had the chicken lasagna. The dishes weren't terrible but they weren't great. Mine was pretty flavorless actually and the sauce tasted canned (like Ragu). The server asked if I wanted to add sausage and I declined. The sausage probably would have added more flavor. My friends dish was also drowning in the same flavorless sauce and didn't have much in the way of vegetables in it as described on the menu. Our server was nice enough but kind of aloof. We had to waive him down to take our order.  Meh. I didn't love it, didn't hate it. I would come back and order something else.",

As a \"neighbor\" of this tucked away spot, I am happy to report friendly service and delicious food.  My table ordered the charcuterie which looked awesome.  I was on day 5 of my veggie kick and this lasagna did not let me down.  Layers of yummy veggies (squash carrots onions...) in-between pasta ribbons with delicious homemade marinara. Fresh Parmesan slices atop make this a big win in my book.  It may have been the 3 glasses of cab sav? Or the yummy fresh buttery bread??  All I know is that we had a lovely Friday family dinner that left us lingering with conversation until closing time.  We never felt rushed and always had drinks.",

I wanted to experience and save the Phoenix winter sunshine so I dined al fresco on the small patio (one large table and three smaller ones).     It took forever to get beverage service and I had waited so long already, I ordered immediately.  I thought a simple salad would be quick.  While I was waiting, the yard crew showed up to leaf blow and mow  the small grass area right by the patio.   Pretty loud.  I overheard the server tell the one other outdoor table that he wondered what else would happen this day.  (Obviously something was off.)  After about forty minutes from the time I sat down, my salad arrived and I had to wolf it down before getting back to a meeting.   My beverage wasn't refilled b/c I was told they were out of iced tea.  How does that happen?  I read good reviews before going so I hope this was a fluke experience.  It looks like a really cool place.",

The vegetarian sandwich with chicken, extra chicken, with a side salad and their peppercorn parmesan dressing. I typically save some of the dressing, or most of it, to dip in my sandwich. They also have a great beer and wine selection too. The staff is incredibly friendly and speedy. In cooler temperatures you can play games outside.

They had a patio and \"backyard\" with cornhole that looked like it would be a lot of fun...when its not 108 degrees outside at lunchtime.  The menu was a little limited. Lots of flatbread options but limited options beyond flatbread - a couple salads and a couple other dishes.  Some more non-flatbread options would be my only suggestion.  Other than that, its a really nice, casual, local, non-chain lunch and drinks option.",

Since I walked there and back, why use up more energy to go back just for that? Just hate every time I order, I may have to double-check everything.

We also really love the ribs, they are crave-worthy and despite there being so many amazing options we continue to go straight for those ribs every time. They have a great beer selection that changes from time to time, but there's always something interesting to try. We tend to always have the same server, and I feel so bad bc I can't remember his name, but he is the best! Always remembers us and is a main reason we continue to frequent this great little spot!",

    "text": "I've been here twice. Came specifically because they were listed on Yelp as dog friendly and it's a lovely environment for dogs. Nice grassy area you can pull a table or chair onto for a beer. Plenty of space so you, your dog and other diners won't feel cramped.  If you bring your dog, have them mix up a small plate of chicken or pork for your pup. It's about $5 and your dog will love you.  Must order the fresh baked bread. This is, imo, the best item on the menu.  Same for the scalloped potatoes.   My friend had the braised beef and I sampled. It was tasty.  I've had pizzas and a sandwich and both were good. I'd probably try the beef or the green chili next time. The pizza is big enough to share, if you split an appetizer.  Unique beer selection that's nicely missing some of the usual suspects on other \"craft beer\" menus. Nice wine menu.  Place can be challenging to find, but once you do it feels like a hidden gem in Phoenix.   Sadly, I do think they allow children. There were a couple of annoying snot goblins running in the grass. Ever wonder why most people's dogs are better behaved than a lot of children? Is it the child or the child's owner that doesn't care that their spawn is annoying others?   Just because you have a kid doesn't mean we all appreciate their shrieking madly about without supervision or half assed parenting that equals a mumbled \"stop that.\" Your dinner out doesn't absolve you of parenting. If anything it means you need to do more of it so your little human isn't a nuisance to other people.  Dog snob? You bet. They will out perform your child any day.",

From a overall 2 star to slowly winning me over to 3 star then taste the food to 4 star to winning me over with the service to 4.5 star (sorry a 20 minute wait at a table drops you from 5 star status).   An average/good selection of wines over all that got me to come here. I ordered the slow braised beef with veggies for $18. After eating I learned that was a good value too! There pricing for wine is 2.5 multiplier which is a good value thus my 5 star rating for value but still good on the yelp meter.  I didn't have room for dessert.   Overall I enjoyed my overall dining experience even though it was a long wait at first. Check it out and you be the critic.",

However there were some aspects that were pretty cool (exposed brick!).  It's pretty causal, seat yourself wherever you like... We each enjoyed a nice glass of wine.  I chose a Tuscan blend I'd never had before that I really liked a lot.  I am following a specific diet right now so I had to be choosy about the menu but they had a lot of different items to choose from.  The roasted mushroom app was delicious as was the antipasto salad.  My hubby got a flatbread which he said was good.  All in all, we enjoyed ourselves.  I'd like to come back and sit on the patio...and for another glass of that Tuscan white!",

They have a very nice healthy (gluten free and vegan options) menu. Wines and Craft Beer on tap. Located midtown with indoor and outdoor seating. Very comfortable, perfect for lunch date or an evening with someone special. I would describe it as classy casual. A rare 5 Star review from me",

Based on the many reviews, we decided to try it for ourselves. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by friendly staff who told us we could sit anywhere. We sat down at a table that had bench seating with a pad and pillows--really homey. There was a chair at our table as well. The menus including drink menus were already on the table as were the silverware. We started to look at the menu when our waiter came over and asked what we wanted to drink. He brought out cold water right away. My husband and I chose to split an entree. We decided on the hip pot roast with garlic bread and fingerling potatoes. We were glad we chose to split an entree. The portion was large and plenty for two people to share. We enjoyed the shredded beef roast cooked in onions and tomatoes, seasoned with a anchov sauce. Every bite was delicious and delightful! A culinary masterpiece! We enjoyed it. The music was jazz playing in the background, the ambience casual and relaxed.  I recommend trying this quaint restaurant for its food and attentive customer service. It's one of the best restaurants in Phoenix in my humble opinion.",

    "text": "The best food is cooked in ovens and grown on vines, so it's really not that hard to look at the name of this place and say \"holy moly, I should go\". But knowing very little about this place, I'd expected another soulless, trendy spot for the yuppies. What I got was much better--a cozy old home re-purposed for stuffing your face with carbs and feeling proud of it. The hosts are warm. You seat yourself. It's like going to a friend's house.  What I liked: The au gratin potatoes. I am used to having them a bit more crisp--a bit more cheesy as well. But with this I feel as though it's less heavy but filled with more spice. My understanding is you can enhance it even more by adding some green chili sauce, which I'd imagine is idea for cold weather.   What I loved: The pesto flatbread is quite frankly the best I've had in this town. The dough, with its generous coat of olive oil is crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The dough is vegan, but doesn't sacrifice an iota of flavor. Also, the prices here are amazing, with many dishes costing under $15, all while competing with the valley's premier pizzerias.   I want to come here for dinner. Heck, I wanna go for lunch as well. I am never ever going to get tired of this place, and I feel comfortable saying that despite a mere two visits. I know it's a bit awkward to find, but it is well worth it.",

I have to admit I was a bit confused on where to go from there, but I ended up just wandering over to what seemed like the entrance until someone was able to help me. My friend and I opted to sit outside even though it was a bit chilly since that's what attracted us to this restaurant in the first place. Honestly seems like the best place to be on a sunny afternoon! In terms of food, I had the mozzarella pesto flatbread (added roasted veggies) and my friend had the slow braised beef. We wanted to try the parmesan fingerling potatoes and the homemade bread which was perfect because those are some of the sides that come with the slow braised beef! My flatbread was delicious and I was a bit surprised at some of the roasted veggies that were added -- particularly the beet, which I usually don't like. But hey, it worked on this flatbread and I had no complaints! My friend liked the slow braised beef and we both enjoyed the potatoes and bread. Service is friendly, the food is good, and the location is great! Aka check it out if you get a chance!",

The property and environment are perfect and it is a great spot to spend some of your time. The ambiance gets 5 stars but the food drops the star rating slightly.  The menu is simple and the prices are very reasonable. The portions are perfect and light for for any snack or meal.  I had ordered the Baked Rigatoni with homemade marinara, herbed ricotta cheese topped with mozzarella & baked. The baked rigatoni was served hot but was a little dry so the server brought an extra side of marinara.  I am eager to return to this spot to enjoy more of the menu and hang out within the yard.

However, much to our regret, the food was not wonderful. We found the menu to be unimaginative. Green chilies, and spicy sauce was featured on many of the items. If you don't like green chilies or spicy food your menu choices are limited. My friend ordered a flat bread. She said that it was way too salty. When salty kalamata olives and salty Italian meat is combined on one flat bread it's bound to be very salty. I know, she could have figured it out before she ordered... The bread was very good and it was also salty. If you don't mind paying a la carte for everything including the bread you will be happy with the prices.  Bottom line: comfortable place with, for us, a regrettable menu.",

Ordered my usual margherita pizza with spinach but opted for extra mozzarella cheese since they put so little on normally (I know that's how its supposed to be tho).  Pizza came and it was obvious from first look that the cheese was not the normal fresh mozzarella they use.  There were a few chunks of fresh mozzarella but mostly a yellowish grated cheese.  I tried a few bites and it tasted like the cheap crappy cheese.  I asked the waiter about it and he denied it and said it was all fresh mozzarella.  I couldn't eat the cheese and ended up taking the cheese off and ate just the crust and sauce.     The waiter came back a bit later and said he talked to the cook and confirmed it was fresh mozzarella and tried to blame it on the fact we had Burratta as an appetizer so the fresh mozzarella must taste bad compared to the Burratta since Burratta is such a top quality cheese.  I can't believe he said that but I dropped it.    I love the vibe of this place and every other time everything I've had rocked.  I will try it again but it it's crap cheese again I am done.    By the way... the Burratta I mentioned earlier was an accidental delivery.  We ordered the plain bread to start with and when he brought the plate it had Burratta on it and said he mistakenly put it in wrong and asked if we would eat it.  I said sure since they would have thrown it out otherwise.  I still got charged for it tho.  That's kinda shitty in my opinion.    I really hope this place isn't going downhill or cheaping out.  I hope it was just a bad night but I had to post it in case someone else has the same issue.",

The patio and bar area are a great place to grab a drink while you wait for a table, though you may just end up dining there as others were.  And the food was excellent, and very reasonably priced. We started with the charcuterie and opted for manchego and burrata mozzarella cheese, complemented with prosciutto and spicy sopressata. It came with almonds and bread drizzled with olive oil. It was all delicious, though the burrata with balsamic won it for me. Afterwards we shared the Earl flatbread and quenched it's spiciness with some yummy cava and an IPA.  I'd definitely like to take another (a few more?) trips to Oven + Vine. Maybe next time I'll get their early enough to indulge in their happy hour.  P.S. The place does fill up fast, so don't be surprised if there is a 30+ minute wait. We were quoted about 45 minutes, but because some parties ended up eating at the bar, we were actually seated in less than 10 minutes.",

I planned on the green chili chicken and pork and Flatbread..for my daughter. .. but.. the Australian Grautin was bland but Cheesy..there was No salt and pepper on my table, so it was Super awkward asking for it. And the rated mushrooms were just that... it needed a Sauce! Or maybe even a filling. I was disappointed with my starters... BUUUUUUT..  there was a GOLDEN HALO... There drink menu is Beer and Wine... and ordering a soda consists of a Vending machine Can of soda and glass of ice. But they have a LIMITED liquor selection. So I ordered a MANHATTAN  and a Vodka LIMONATA for my Aunt. Annnd it was the STRONGEST... 11$ MANHATTAN  of my LIFE!!!! I called an Uber to go across the street to eat my meal.  If you want the best DRINKS  then Oven + Vine is the place to go..   I'd  be proud to make this the Happy Hour spot!!! But for food... I left and went to SWITCH. *all typos are attributed to the Strongest  and Bestest Manhattan ever!!!!",

Oh and the potato au gratin is sinfully delicious. I will be back there to try other dishes....and the green chili chicken....again.",

He's moving out here in a month, so we want to start trying out places to become our future haunts :)  We both felt this one would be visited on the reg!  The service was spectacs, let me just tell you.  On point, considerate, everything always topped off, empties immediately taken away - you can't get much better!  The food was tiiieeeeeeeght!  Any place with a charcuterie plate has my vote f'SHO!  We split that, the rigatoni, The Earl flatbread, AND the au gratin potatoes...if we weren't already bringing home so many leftovers, I would have asked for a second helping, to go.  That sh!ts was legits.  The ONLY thing I would change is more chairs and less bar stools.  I could have sunk in a little deeper if there were more chairs...good thing?  Bad thing?  You choose :)",

They had lights strung above the patio tied between the trees and lawn Wooden chairs.

We got the spicy sausage, goat cheese, and sharp cheddar. It comes with some garlic toasts, which were delicious. The Earl Flatbread is spicy and we split it - which was enough food for us with the cheese plate to start. We couldn't finish it and had to take some home!Delicious!!!!",

The bread is baked in house (though a tad more salt in the dough would be nice, it was bland), and they use if for the sandwiches and flatbreads.

The look is cool and I thought that the atmosphere seemed really great at first. We grabbed a beer and iced tea from the bar and asked if we could order an appetizer but were told that the server at the bar was unable to do food service. We sat at the bar with our drinks for a few minutes before she asked if we would be ok letting a couple sit down that had been waiting for a while so that they could eat dinner. We stood. Then it hit me. She couldn't get us an appetizer but she could get them dinner? Ok... not the end of the world but it was odd. We waited about 15 more minutes before another lady asked if we were interested in sitting at the community table. We sat down and for the next 30-35 minutes we had no service, eye contact, drink refills, or attention at all. Again, it was Friday and I get that but someone could have at least said \"we are busy here are a few menus, do you need another drink?\" The person I was with grabbed a passing server and told him that we had been waiting a long time and he seemed annoyed. I finally got up and  said \"Forget it we can close out and leave.\" He just turned and left. I walked up to a man near the bar and asked if we could cash out since we had been waiting for such a long time to eat. He said not to worry and he'd cover the drinks and it was Friday and I needed to understand that. He didn't offer a big apology or ask if I'd like to order. Instead he made me feel like he would prefer if we left, so we did. This was extremely disappointing since I have heard such good things.",

Our roasted veggie appetizers were excellent, the wine and beer were great and Austin is our FAVORITE waiter!  So attentive and what a memory!  He took all six orders without writing them down and they all came out perfect!  And did I mention the bread?  I usually buy a loaf to take home with me and enjoy it for a few days!

When you walk in, the restaurant is small, cozy, rustic and cute.    We walked in during lunch time and the restaurant was nearly empty.  Our server was not generally friendly - it was a tad bit uncomfortable. I ordered The Earl and it was a pretty decent size for a flatbread! It was ok, but honestly, I wasn't really that hungry because I had gotten down with a burrito two hours before.  As we were finishing up, it took forever to get our check - in which I didn't understand why. When we left, I felt like I was missing something - I just felt uncomfortable being there. Maybe it's because of the lack of a warm welcome for dining at the establishment or even the \"thank you for coming\". I honestly think if the service improved, this place will be busy in no time!",

    "text": "First, I have to say that I'm really mad that I moved around the corner from here three months ago, go to rollover donuts regularly, and still didn't go to oven + vine until tonight. I'm just so mad that good food has been this close to me and I didn't know it. Ok. On to the review of this fantastic spot.   We brought my parents who were visiting from out of town to check out a local spot. The ambience is casual and laid back without trying to feel too hip or snooty - it feels like it's a part of the neighborhood. We grabbed a spot at the middle table and our waiter Austin came to grab our drink and appetizer orders. We ordered the roasted mushrooms and buffaletta. The mushrooms were roasted in garlic oil and topped with shaved Parmesan, served with the best bread I've ever had at a restaurant. They came out piping hot and they were fantastic! The buffaletta was creamy and drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar - it's my favorite cheese, and they did it justice.   My husband and I each got a flatbread. I got the Margherita and added prosciutto. Their marinara sauce is divine. The crust, better than anything else that tries to call itself a \"flatbread.\" Bubbly, crispy, chewy perfection topped with fresh mozzarella and basil. My husband got the Earl and while I didn't try it, he certainly loved it.   My parents both got the green chile chicken. I have to say this - my mom is really picky. She is an amazing cook and doesn't like to go out to eat much and doesn't want to waste her time or money on something she could make at home. My mom took one bite of the green chile chicken and a huge grin came across her face. Then she started dancing in her seat. It is that good, guys. So tender and juicy and spicy and delicious. She got a side of the au gratin potatoes and they were so creamy and struck the perfect balance between savory, salty and just a hint of lactic sweetness. My dad finished his bowl and had a side of the roasted seasonal vegetables that looked awesome. Mom had enough left over that she's going to put it on toast with a sunny side up egg tomorrow morning (I can't wait).   We capped the night off with the chocolate torte and a scoop of gelato to split between the four of us. The torte was so perfectly dense and rich, and the tartness of the raspberry compote that came on the plate paired with the torte so well.   I have no complaints. Fantastic atmosphere, great service and delicious food. I can't wait to bring my friends the next time for drinks, appetizers and that amazing torte!",

With space outside for mingling and lawn games, I could see Oven + Vine being a new regular spot. We ordered the charcuterie board and a couple of glasses of wine and enjoyed just savoring both. The wine/beer selection has something for every palate, and I would be surprised if you could come here and not find a new favorite indulgence. The servers are so friendly and easy going. I love that this space is in a cozy old home. Again, a great feel for cozying up in the fall/winter with friends or a book and a glass/bottle of wine.",

It was a Saturday night; they don't take reservation, so it was very busy.  We agreed to put our name down and wait for 1 hour.  We found a couple of counter stools available, however, Claire in a rude tone, told us that we couldn't sit there because it's for dine in.  She then told us we needed to move and wait against the wall on the sidewalk or pointed to an area by the tree.  It was because of this rude tone that we walked out and went to another restaurant nearby.  No one from our group is ever going back to this place!!  Very disappointing.  P.S.  Reading the Yelp comments here, it looks like Claire was also rude to other Yelpers.",

It's a house on the north side of Vernon that could easily be overlooked as the street is pretty dark. The vibe inside is something else. Between the fireplace and the patio it screams cozy. We got the veg lasagna, bread and green chili chicken. Amazinng. The bread comes in four slices, it was warm and so soft we even had to get more. The green chili chicken was way too spicy for me (I'm a wuss, just was trying my boyfriends meal) but he found it has a kick but not too much. Our server was also great. Very attentive and super nice (she was always smiling). We can't wait to come back again and try the pizza and other lasagnas!",

Walked in and they had a large variety of craft beer, mostly stuff I'd never heard of. We drove home talking about how we already needed to plan on going back and the smell of the food that awaited us as was intoxicating. We got home and killed the food in minutes! It was all awesome. I have to admit the roasted vegetable salad didn't sound very good to me but it blew me away. Meat and cheese boards never fail but theirs was phenomenal. And \"The Earl\".  So dang good.

Guess what, they have a secret assortment of liquor and a great kick ass Manhattan that is the trifecta of large, strong, and tasty.  Ok because I am also about the food, the food was amazing.   We started with the Charcuterie plate of 2 cheeses and 2 meats (I would have liked some more interesting cheeses and would love to see some more creativity with a chutney) the Caprese Salad, and the Fingerling Potatoes.  All three were nicely sized for sharing and nicely priced. We moved on to try three of the salads. The Italian was a nice assortment of meats and greens with Parmesan. The roasted veggie salad had beets, onions, green beans, summer squash with greens.  The Ashland was baby spinach with bacon onions and Parmesan. The dressing choices were a nice Parmesan peppercorn and a weirdly gloppy fat free Italian (just about the only miss tonight). For our next round we tried the tasty Sausage and Mushroom and the more interesting and even more tasty pesto prosciutto flatbreads.  Both were crisp and chewy and perfect.  I had the Green Chili Pork. This little casserole of tasty was had pork chunks and onions in a nicely balanced green chili sauce with just a bit of heat (I would add jalapenos next time).  Next to this I had the AuGratin Potatoes. Shaped like a load of corn bread, these were some of the best AuGratins I have ever had.  We split the bittersweet chocolate cake with vanilla gelato and raspberry sauce.  Nice balance but a slight miss with too cold gelato but still very good. Great service with good recommendations, wine and beer and the $140 bill seemed like a steal.  We will be back for sure.",
