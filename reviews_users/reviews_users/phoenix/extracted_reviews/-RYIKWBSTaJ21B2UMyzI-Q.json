    "text": "Yay! I'm a fan... sort of. The pizza is just average but their bar is amazing!  They had so many beers on tap, I could hardly believe my eyes. We sat down at the bar to wait and by the time I had made up my mind and ordered something our table was ready. Fortunately we were seated at a high top in the bar area so I could continue to gaze upon the beautiful array of beer taps and ponder my next beverage choice. Perennial options include choice beers from Deschutes, Magic Hat, Left Hand, Big Sky, New Belgium, Mudshark as well as local favorites San Tan and Four Peaks. But the really awesome thing was that they had a dozen or so rotating taps. Waitress provided us with a paper list of the seasonal choices but there were quite a few that I was not familiar with and being in the mood to try something new I sat patiently trying to catch the bartender's eye so I could ask questions. Our waitress came back and offered to help. After a few queries, I could see that she really knew her stuff. I have never met a server with so much craft beer knowledge before. Usually they give vague answers or else run to the barback to ask. She even gave me a couple samples to try. It was pretty cool.  I know Mellow Mushroom is a chain but I think it is neat that each location has it's own character. This one in Ahwatukee is decorated in a movie theme since they are across the street from the AMC. There was a giant King Kong and Hollywood signs... stuff like that. Overall it was a pretty cool environment. I liked the high ceilings because that kept it from being too loud. It was a lively atmosphere with a lot of chatter but because of the ceilings and the bar being open to the outside it never got annoying. We ordered a pizza that was half Kosmic Karma and half Mightly Meaty. Hubby thought his half did have enough meat on it but I was pretty happy with mine. I liked the sundried tomatoes and feta cheese... that added a slightly Mediterranean flavor. Their crust was soft and chewy and I believe they brush it with butter and sprinkle it with parmesan cheese. It sort of tasted like breadsticks. I'd have to say I think Spinatos or Nellos make better pizza but Mellow Mushroom was pretty good and I think a bit cheaper than either of those.  The funniest thing was that they whole reason we went there in the first place was that we had gotten a coupon in the mail but after a few beers we completely forgot about it. So, good news is now we have the perfect excuse to go back again!",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for some time but every time I've asked someone that has been here they didn't have anything positive to say.  I finally gave in but I have to say this was definitely a BIG mistake.  I ordered a 14\" pizza , 1 order of wings mild along with a Reese's peanut butter cookie.  The pizzas dough was just way too chewy with no flavor and very little texture to it.  The sauce on the pizza was more like a spaghetti sauce, I'm sorry but a pizza sauce should be different than a pasta sauce with a bit of zing to it.  This was nothing to write home about and to top it off the pizza was covered with way too much cheese, so much so that any flavors of the toppings or sauce were drowned out by the cheese.  Not even a good cheese at that, definitely not from Wisconsin.  The wings looked nothing like the pic and were a little burned.  I got the impression they put the sauce on the wings before they baked not after so this was probably how they got charred.  Suffice it to say any leftovers went immediately into the trash bin this morning.  As far as the cookie, I did not see any Reese's or taste much peanut butter plus they just crammed it into this plastic container that it was basically in several large pieces.  As for the service, there was a smile but the order was just plopped down on the bar and no attempt was made to go over it or ask if I needed any utensils, napkins, Parmesan, anything just bye.  Talk about feeling cheap, anyway, I will not be coming back and from now on I shall listen to my friends.",

    "text": "Ahhhh.... pizza and alcohol after trying on wedding dresses, but that's a different review. Based on previous reviews, we must've lucked out today.  Our experience was nothing like The others.   The lunch menu has a half/half pizza special which we ordered 1/2 thai 1/2 maui both chicken with a spinach salad.  The pizza was good.  The salad was ok.  I probably wouldn't order another salad here.   They're way overpriced for what they are.   But.... the salad dressing was excellent.   The decor is described as eclectic, which it is.  (See pics lol).  There's an outside patio but it's still a bit too warm for that.  Our server was attentive and several other employees stopped by to check on us.  I will agree that this place is expensive.  They really do have only pizza, calzones,  salad,  and a few appetizers.  And a bar.  Our bill with no drinks was 30.00 for two ppl. Not including tip.  Which is where I'd take another half start off if that was an option.",

    "text": "This one is long overdue. We've been to this location 3 times, well actually 4, but we didn't stay one time. We drove down to the location in Tempe.  The ambience. It's decorated with an old time movie theater vibe. Cute but really, what does it have to do with anything? This location used to be a brew pub so the bar area really is more of a major focal point than an add-on.  So as I mentioned, we've eaten here 3 times but been here 4 times and each time on a Saturday night. The first time we got here kind of late, 10ish, but we were sat in the dining room. This will make sense momentarily. The second time we came here we arrived later in the evening again. But we were sat in the dining room. The 3rd time we tried to come here we were told that the only seating was in the bar area. What? Yes. It was around the same time in the evening that we'd been here before but this time I guess they didn't want any new arrivals in the dining room so the only option was the bar. C, our 10-year-old son, was with us so the bar was not going to be an option. Just a quick note here. The restaurant is supposed to be open until 2am. That's really not True. The bar is open until 2am. The restaurant portion is only open until the manager / bartender / server of the month, whomever, decides it's not busy enough and closes that side down. Hence, our experience on our 3rd visit. Back to the funny part. So since we thought they were open until 2, K called the Tempe location to see if their dining room was still open. The person on the phone told K that indeed, the dining room was open. Now this is down on Mill Ave. near Arizona State University and I thought for sure it would be packed and just be a hassle. It wasn't. Leaving the Ahwatukee location, driving down to Mill Ave., parking and yet by the time we arrived which was 30 minutes or so later, we were sat in the dining room. Hmm. You can read that review under the Mellow Mushroom Tempe location. Our 4th visit was much earlier in the evening so there wasn't an issue.  The food. The 3 times we've eaten here the food has been decent. The pricing is on the high side in my opinion. We always get the same thing. On our first visit our server turned K onto a special beer they had, it was a sour beer. K loved it. She tried to order it the next 2 times we were here but they were out. Figures, right. Anywhoos, the \"special beer\" was $6.50. Seems a bit high for a can of beer that probably cost them $1-1.50. I had the Papago Orange Blossom ($7.50). Again, overpriced. Plus, it's a local beer that you can buy at tons of locations including Target of all places for around $7 a four pack. Charging so much for a beer that's brewed down the street is a bit much. We ordered a couple of pies. The first was a large cheese ($16.49) with Italian Sausage ($2.89). Just under 20 bones for a large one topping pizza. Well, the price is high but the flavor was great. We all really enjoyed the pizza. The cheese was hot, the crust was tasty, slightly sweet with a yeasty hint, and the sausage was not overly fatty nor spicy and quite tasty. Winner winner pizza pie dinner. Our second pizza was a medium Cheese ($13.49) with Ham ($2.19), Caramelized Onions ($1.79) and Pineapple ($1.79). See how fast the price rises? We've gotten these 2 pizza's each time we've been here and each time they've been pretty good pies. The servers we've had on our 3 visits have been pleasant and the food good. If you don't mind sitting in the bar, don't bother looking at your watch but if you want to sit in the dining room, make sure you're there before 10pm.  Funky decor. Hours at the whim of the Mgr/bartender/whomever. High prices. Good beer selection. Good Pizza. 3 Stars.",

    "text": "2nd review: I had to come back and change my initial review from 4 stars to 2 after our take out debacle last week. Long story short my order was not entered or sent to the kitchen when I called so it wasn't ready when I arrived. I had to wait for the order to be made, once we got it home it was not good. It didn't seem like they let the pizza cook long enough, the dough was gummy/soggy. Some of the ingredients were lacking, etc. To top it off the manager , who made the mistake of not sending in my order, didn't comp anything, give us a free dessert or even offer me a beverage while I waited on the order that should have been ready when I walked in. I have worked in the restaurant industry for years and I know how to take care of the customers when something goes wrong and they failed here on that front.   1st Review:We dined here for lunch and it was the second time I had it. The first time was at a birthday party and it was takeout, so this was the first time I had it fresh out of the oven.. so to speak. We had half BBQ Chicken and half Red potato.. both were delicious! My husband said, \"best crust I have ever had!\" and he also said that it was his \"new favorite pizza\". I agree.. it was super yum! The only small issue I had with the pizza was the chicken on the BBQ pizza tasted stale (if you will)... not rotten or even bad... but it just tasted not fresh. Now... when I got bites of the BBQ pizza with chicken, BBQ sauce, cheese, etc... I could not tell the chicken tasted weird. Overall... we were very pleased and will be back often.",

The cheese was still hot and melted which made it the best pie of the trio, but the gluten free crust still really sucked. The kind of suck that fills you with regret for ordering it.

    "text": "We sat behind a couple who the manager wrongly accused of not paying their bill. The manager Terrah, was screaming at them and told them they were lying about giving the payment to their server, used profanity towards them and threatened to call the police. All In front of the other patrons.  The female customer said their server was obviously high on drugs and suggested she lost it. The manager refused to listen to them.  When the manager found that the server HAD misplaced their payment, she said to them \"good bye. You can go\"  No apologies, no sorry our mistake. Nothing.  I have NEVER witnessed such unprofessional behavior.  As a business owner myself, knowing that management represents us in our absence, I would be embarrassed and appalled by her treatment of these people.  Perhaps both employees need drug testing. Needless to say the manager should be fired. I highly doubt that couple will be returning to Mellow Mushroom and neither will we. Our server was perfect and the food was good but we can do without the managers \"Jerry Springer\" side show. I'm sure the owner will understand, if not the manager, how powerful word of mouth is in this business.",

    "text": "Went for the Pie He Porter, left full of sadness and despair.  Explains the Groupon.  The fact that they consider themselves a pizza joint is a disgrace to pizza makers everywhere. What was placed in front of me was not a pizza. Maybe I'm missing something, but I seriously doubt it.  First impressions were a bit on the creepy side. This being the Ahwatukee location with flashing lights at the entrance, with a Chuck E Cheese feel as you opened the doors. They have this movie theme going on that is equally disturbing. We chose to sit at the bar to avoid a 10 minute wait for a table and the option to turn our backs to the bizarre movie inspired decor.  For the record, our service was perfect. We sat at the bar and never had an empty glass. The bartender was spot on, friendly and accommodating.   Figured we would try the pretzels made with their signature crust. That should have been our warning to spend the rest of our Groupon on beer. We failed our instinct and ordered a pie.  I can't get over the fact that, A) they consider this crust worthy of anything other than concrete filler. And, B)Why in the hell was there a wait for a table?  Aside from the strange texture of the \"crust\", the toppings were also less than stellar with the freshness right out of the grocery store near by and designed by the mind of a child. The one good thing I can say about the toppings is that they were there, as we were hungry and needed something to actually eat.   We did manage to eat about 3/4's of our pie toppings before the realization that we were simply eating to eat, and at the same time swirling into an endless pit of depression.  Even the beer didn't help at this point. That alone speaks volumes.  To be honest, I can't even finish this review because of the trauma I am still experiencing after my visit. The sheer horror that I actually attempted to consume this thing they call a pizza and the fact that I actually paid for it.",

While delivery time was acceptable and the delivery man was very nice, I found myself having difficulty stomaching the pepperoni pizza I had ordered. What separates Mello Mushroom from other pizza places is the fact that they use a molasses-based dough for their pizzas. While this is definitely a unique tactic, I feel that it is a very poor decision. Molasses has a very specific taste which DOES NOT do well with typical pizza toppings like meat and cheese. Service was good, but the food certainly wasn't.",

    "text": "Meh. This had pluses and minuses. Plus - the beer menu was fantastic. Minus - they poured my Dogfishhead 90 minute IPA (expensive, tasty) into a hot glass. So, nasty warm expensive beer. Thanks, new bartenders! I will say they gave me a new, cold glass to pour it into, which helped. As soon as I started telling the server what happened, she finished my sentence - guess that happens a lot. But really, what bartender worth their salt does that? Side note, happy hour is only till 6 (instead of 7 like most places). So when you're off around 5, like most of us, then head over, you have maybe half an hour. Which is lame. Next, the food. Ordered the pretzels, which, per the menu, are made from the pizza dough. They are not, however. They are made from wheat flour. Which is fine, but for the fact that it was not indicated. So, surprise! Doughy, crunchy, brown, extremely bland pretzels. I could smell garlic, but surely could not taste it. Meh!!!! I decided at that point not to order any food - I was unimpressed. However my husband texted and asked if I could bring him a salad. So I braved it. No bueno. They have 2 sizes/prices of salads, so I thought the expensive one would be large. Having learned from the pretzel escapade, however, I specifically asked whether the large would be enough for two, and was given an emphatic YES! It's more than enough! So I did a \"build your own\" salad. Plus - You can create your own salad as desired! Minus- It's TINY! And every topping is individual. Which would be ok if it were slathered with toppings, but it's not. Got mushrooms - for $1 - and there were (quite literally, I counted) six slices of mushroom. Which I'm almost sure is not even a whole mushroom. For $1!!! Also ordered bleu cheese crumbles, at a whopping $2.50, and had - no joke - two tiny balls of bleu cheese. All told the salad cost $13 ($13!!!) and was subpar. All on all, I was angry with myself for stopping here. The bartenders didn't know what they were doing, the food blew, and it was packed with screaming children. I will note, however, in addition to the excellent beer menu, we had a great server. That's why they got the second star.",

You should never have to ask for your check, and you should NEVER be within ear shot of the drama that obviously goes on at the ahwatukee location!  Management need's to step up and have a refresher with the kids about professionalism, customer comes first, geez the list goes on.  Oh! and did I mention the manager yelling at the bar girl for a couple that walked out because the service was so slow.  OH!  and the best part is that it was soooo slow when I was there on Sat that I could here cricket's.  Hmmmmm my beer was good though lol.  If I may make a suggestion, I know it's a happen area; however, pita jungle has always been a fav of mine, and of course RA.  Unfortunately if your looking for a cool place like I thought MM would be....I would maybe give a bit until they get their act together.  Oh yeah, the food, well......the pretzel's were not bad; however, they do take up to 25 to make and the beer cheese was cold and already had a layer over the top.  I'm guessing because they were done and sat for awhile.  Who knows.  Good luck if you choose to go to the Ahwatukee location :)",

After a day of Xmas shopping we headed to the Mellow Mushroom. We have always heard good things about this place so we gave them a shot.  As we were seated everything started off great our server was nice and polite. We ordered a couple of hoagies and a large meaty meat pizza, after waiting 20 minutes for the pizza it arrived super dark, the bottom hard as a rock and you could see by looking at it that it was over cooked. We asked our server about it and she immediately said \" oh ya that is over cooked\". Well if it was so obviously over cooked why serve it to us? She then called over the manager. Manager Brandon apologized and offered to replace it and remove it from our bill. We thought great! As long as they made it right for us we were good and we thanked him for taking care of us. Well, after waiting about 15-20 minutes Manager Brandon came back to our table and said that there was a problem with the pizza and that they would have to remake another one because cheese being stuck to the bottom of a pan and they could get the pizza out without tearing. He offered us 3- $5 dollars off coupons on our next visits which at this point was not enough as I doubt we'll ever be back. Again, we thanked him and hoped for the best as we were freaking starving at this point. Finally an hour and ten minutes after our initial order our pizza arrived. Looked and smelled fantastic. We dug in and wouldn't you know it my wife finds a piece of plastic in her slice... Are you freaking kidding me!!! We politely asked for the bill, paid and left.... Not even mentioning the plastic to them.. For what? At this point we just wanted out of of there! I gave this one  star because Brandon did try to make things right but apparently he's up against a bunch of slobs in the Kitchen! Lazy, Lazy,lazy!! Advise to the kitchen staff, change careers!! You don't belong cooking to the public!",

Once again after discussing a selection with the server, she returned to advise that they did not carry our selection any longer. This is a repeat problem. Also for some reason, the wait staff cannot seem to remember to give you plates to put your food on. The gluten free pizza was good.

I walked in and immediately asked my friend, \"Are we in the right place? This looks like some kind of theater\". All of a sudden a young lass by the name of Leah approached us and welcomed us. It was at that moment I knew I was in the dopest pizza place around. My server was really chill, but for the life of me I can't remember his name. He noticed some cuts on my hand I had acquired earlier in the day and asked me what I had done. I informed him that it was a longboarding disaster, and he proceeded to inform me of a series of tips and tidbits to help prevent myself from falling next time. Anyway, Leah was nice enough to give me a tour of the second floor even though it was closed, and whoa, it was bodacious. There were so many intriguing decorations scattered about the invigorating environment. I got the half baked brownie supreme and it was totally rad. So I'm going to give the Mellow Mushroom 4 stars today. And if any of the big dogs in the front office are reading this, I would totally recommend promoting Leah and giving that other guy a raise.",

    "text": "Where do I begin! My family and I went in a few weeks ago to have lunch, kind of excited to try a new pizza place.  We ordered a pretzel appetizer and it was okay, the marinara sauce was not very flavorful. We then ordered a create your own pizza and it was horrible, the sauce had absolutely no flavor and I could have had better flavor by licking sandpaper. The waitress was okay, but never came to ask how our food was and in all honesty if she would have asked I would have told her, but I didn't want to make a big deal about it at the time. The selection of beer looked pretty good and my wife and I said that we would only come back just for happy hour to have a beer.  We did go back this passed Saturday January 4th and let me tell you that I will officially never set foot in that place again. My wife and I went in for a beer around 11pm and we sat there for a few minutes before we were acknowledged. The bar top was almost full, but there were two bartenders so in my opinion it wasn't that busy. A heavier set guy with a hat and tattoos came over to get our order. We ordered two beers, my wife got her beer and they told me that they were changing the keg for my beer. It took on my watch 15 min to get my beer and my wife was completely finished with hers. The guy never came back to let us know what was going on because at that point I would have just chosen another beer! He brought it over and just said sorry about that. What really sent me over the edge is when a blonde haired female that I am assuming was a manager because she was walking around with keys on her hip and talking care of something in the computer for the bartenders, never even came over to say anything. I then saw her take a to-go cup from the back side of the beer taps put it through to the front and began to pour beer into it. She then walked over to the other side of the bar and gave the cup to the guy who served us our beer. He walked out from behind the bar and went to drink the beer from the cup. This place is a joke and obviously has their priorities all screwed up.",

    "text": "Stopped in here for an impromptu lunch with my lovely wife after years since my last Mellow Mushroom visit.   We were indecisive, while out shopping, about where to go for food and this ended up being the consensus.   Hey, I forgot there's a Mellow Mushroom here, let's check that out!       We sat on the patio during what was a beautiful afternoon.   This location used to be Rock Bottom until the concept change a year or two (or three?) ago.  Great memories from Rock Bottom.   It was interesting to go inside the building for the first time since that transition and see how...completely different it is.   Even including the front entrance.   Looks like they retained the tap system from Rock Bottom, and that's great.  Huge beer selection, lots of craft brews.  I like beer so that's a good thing.     As I said, it's been years since I've been to a Mellow Mushroom and what I remembered of it was...really, really good pizza.    Like, excellent pizza.    We ordered a house special on this visit and it was just mediocre.   It wasn't bad.   Considering, however, that it had Mozzarella, Pepperoni, Sausage, Ground Beef, Ham, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Mushrooms, Black Olives, Roma Tomatoes, Green Peppers, Onions and extra Cheese (sounded to us like we could NOT go wrong), I thought it just didn't have much flavor.  The crust around the edge was good, but under the pizza it was not crispy at all.      Our server was friendly and provided good, prompt service.    I drink a lot of water, and she kept me in the water for sure.    I was pleased with the service we received.  In summary, the pizza just did not live up to expectations, and I felt let down.   I don't think I will go back here again as a result, unless I'm in the area and decide to stop in for a craft brew at the inviting looking bar.  If I do that, I won't be ordering a pizza.",

    "text": "Mellow Mushroom is a perfect place for late night food when you're lit with friends, but I'm not sure if I would recommend it for a nice formal dinner, even if you're craving pizza. We had the \"constant karma\" pizza, with tomato and a pesto sauce. Unfortunately, the pizza was pretty soggy after the heated cheese and pesto sauce mixed, and so it was difficult to eat the pizza, even when using a fork and knife. While I do appreciate a good pizza that stays simple to tomato + basil combination, the flavors just didn't pop for me, on top of being difficult to eat.  * the caveat is I wasn't drunk when I had this, so maybe the experience is enhanced when not completely sober. But for those of you who are straight edge, Fired Pie across the street has some better customizable and fresh pizza.",

The pizza is different and the atmosphere is way different. The mushroom and soup on the menu was pretty good and that was a great start. The pizza was not that great though. Too much sauce and the pizza as a whole was kid of bland. Also, the MM in GA wood fired their pizza when I was there so I was expecting a crispy crust, but this was more like the crust at Pizza Hut. Ok for what it is, but I don't think it is up to the standard the original location sets.",

When it was time to pay the check I have him a 20 dollar bill he right away said are u gonna need change I TOLD HIM YES (he was hinting to give the rest as a tip). I told him bring the change and I'll figure out the tip  . So he comes back with the twenty dollar bill and no change and says \" I just left the whol twenty so just let me know\"  like wtf I already told him clearly bring the change . I always tip 18-20 percent depends on service but this guy was set on how much he wanted to get tipped . I got fed up and just left he ended up getting like a 23 percent tip because he pretty much forced us to. I've been a server and would never do that . I think he was wrong and if I had the time I would have made him go get the change and would have gave him 10 percent for acting like that . So when u go there heads up for Dutch he will forcefulling make you tip more than he deserves.  Very pushy and no one deserves that. I Tip on how the service was . Point blank .",

Get it together, woman!  At least act like you care.  The mighty meaty pizza was really good, full of delicious meaty toppings, and I love the crust!  Yeasty and wheaty and really delicious.  But $21.59 for a medium?  Really?  I think I blasphemed for the first time here.  Then the oven-roasted wings were very tasty as well.  Hot and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  $10.49 for 10?  Over a buck a piece?  Second bad set of words uttered here.  They have a fantastic beer selection.  The server asked me if I wanted a glass with the bottle of beer I ordered and I declined.  My husband had ordered a beer in a can (we didn't know that at the time), and she didn't offer him a glass.  Weird.  Just a preference thing, but beer in a can tastes much better from a glass.  No tinny overtones.  We each had 2 beers and all were $6.50 each except for the Belgian beer in a can that was $5.50.  All in it was $61.82 after tax, before tip.  Blaspheming continued here.  Our server was really almost nonexistent and not engaged with us as far as talking about the food and beers and even said she doesn't bother to learn the beer list because it changes so much.    Next time we'll try happy hour so we can afford to eat and drink here, and we'll sit at the bar to maybe get good service.  The place is huge and I like the eclectic decor all over the place.  The outdoor patio and bar seating looked very inviting too.  Maybe we'll have a better experience the next time around.  **Update.  After hearing from the owner just a short time after I posted my review, I'm going to add a star.  I am completely impressed with a business owner that can approach a less-than stellar review with good questions and feedback.  That makes a huge difference.",

He was bothered anytime I asked a question about the menu and even got so bad he started arguing loudly with me over the price of a beer. It was happy hour and didn't want to change the price of a beer to what it should have been. Will never come again. Don't bother wasting your time on this place.",

Took one pizza off the bill and said sorry about the wait. when we got our bill $50. He gave us 6 coupons for $5 off each time we come back (as if we're going to come back 6x - I won't ever be back!

The girls at the front, very nice and I love the decor of the place.  We get to the table and our waitress did not know what to recommend, she gave us the same opinion about everything with no personality.  I research most places before I go and I knew of their lunch specials so I asked her and she said they had none.  So I had to pull out my phone to show her the lunch specials and all of the sudden she remembered... Hmmm.. Then food took 30-35 for lunch w an empty establishment, the food gets in and the waitress is dropping everything on our table.  The past time I went, me and my husband literally had a pizza for us and one beer each and spent $70 which to me is very pricey.  The food is AMAZING I do want to say that, the pizza dough is heaven but you gotta do more to charge that much money. It's supposed to be an experience.  That's all!",

I think this might have been our last trip to this store for awhile. They managed to get 5 out of our 6 orders messed up. This was even after giving server advice that they had mixed the way we asked for wings up before so could she make sure she communicates clearly with the kitchen. Nope.... No Bueno!! On top of that we have 2 black people in our party and music is loudly blaring a racial slur, the N word over and over. As we were leaving I asked the waitress to please explain to the manager how insensitive this was to our guest and she insisted it was ok because the manager from Happy Vally store who picks out night time happy hour music mix is Black so it's ok!!! It certainly was not ok, it was embarrassing for us. We had a Nigerian man with us from L.A. and it was embarrassing!! Disrespectful!!! One young lady with us ordered Vegan Pizza due to dairy allergies and stomach issues. She eats 1 piece and realizes the taste is off that it was not made with Vegan Cheese, manager comes over and gets her the right order but does nothing to even offer to compensate feeding her wrong food. He could have offered a dessert or a soft drink. The Vegan Pizza was a mid-$20 range pizza!! He could have taken 10% off her bill all he would say is \"I replaced the pizza\"!   Really......... She will likely be ill from your mistake pizza tomorrow!",

Finally another gentleman went and got the manager and when he approached the desk he had an attitude already. He told us, not asked us to be patient and that they were working on the large party. At that point I informed him that the hostess had appeared 2 times and another girl once and neither of them even acknowledged any of us. The manager again said to be patient, that they just opened and had a large party. I said, you have been open 45 minutes, this is very poor customer service. He sarcastically said again to be patient. I told him we would be leaving and going to eat somewhere else.....his reaction was to Thank me for my patience. .....

I have not one bad thing to say. I actually can't wait to take my family when they visit from Prescott.",

    "text": "Being in the food industry, I try not to complain because everyone has their off days. Servers, at the end of the day, are only human. However, at this location, I feel like the Bartenders are always annoyed. They're open until 2:00 am, so when a group of people walk in at 11:00, they have no reason to roll their eyes or make the guests feel like they're disturbing them. You have to wait at least 10 minutes before they walk over with menus (It's seat-yourself at night) and then getting their attention throughout the entire meal is next to impossible. And they have never brought the check without me having to walk over to the bar and ask them for it. One time my friend and I did an experiment and stacked our plates at the end of the table so we looked finished, and waited for our check rather than walk over and get it, and no one came over to our table for 45 minutes!! We planned on just grabbing a drink and a quick bite to eat after a long day at work, but it turned into a 3 hour dinner.  I usually go to Mellow at least once a week because I love the food and the Happy Hour prices (That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1). It's just not a good feeling, feeling like you're inconvencing someone or bugging them when you're only asking them to do their job. I'm not saying you shouldn't go there...again, I love the food and all of the vegetarian options, however, just keep in mind that you will feel like you're bothering them if you walk in after 10 pm.",

We ordered their version of a meat-lovers pizza, and it was thick-crusted, greasy heaven. Absolutely amazing.  The restaurant itself is actually pretty neat as well. It's designed in a movie-type fashion, with excellent decor. Such as a King Kong bursting through the ceiling, an (as close as you can get indoors) life-size dinosaur grazing over the bathroom, and movie theater seats in the foyer. Very kid friendly.  We went on a Sunday afternoon, so it wasn't overly busy, but it wasn't absolutely empty, either. Our service was great out on the patio. And they have quite the beer list to go with your delicious pizza.",

It's fun on mill ave, but the ahwatukee store is easier to get to, way more chill, and has a great atmosphere. The place looks awesome, has movie nostalgia all over, giant sculptures of king kong and dinosaurs, it's sweet, kids would go crazy over it for sure.  The servers are chill and nice, especially this guy named Austen. He was nice, patient, and totally laid back, the guy was pronto too on everything. Water refills every second, courtesy, all that jazz. I hope the manager of this location is reading this, because Austen is the man and deserves a bonus, for real.  Capri is good, hummus is good, the grub is good! no doubt about it. Big, long, beer selection guarantees a good night out!",

    "text": "I rather thought this Mellow Mushroom was fun.  A classic cinema theme pizza and beer joint!    We started off ordering the Stuffed Portabello Mushroom; stuffed artichoke hearts, feta cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and mozzarella.  It was drizzled with some balsamic oil and is plated on a bed of lettuce.  If you're a mushroom fan then this quick bite is for you!  The texture is not my cup of tea; I wanted some crunch and brittleness!  However, the flavor was decent with the balsamic providing a sweet bite along with the salad.  For our pizza, we did mushrooms again; right!?  We tried the Holy Shiitake Pie which included shiitake, portabello, and button mushrooms; along a mix of caramelized onions and mozzarella cheese.  Drizzled with a garlic aioli and some truffle oil; this pizza had some aromatic punch!  Granted, I'm a meat lovers kind of guy and this pizza didn't really do it for me.  The crust was thick and doughy so that was a plus for us carb-loaders!  Overall, Mellow Mushroom is a good pizza joint with some fun and interesting ingredients.  Though I thought the price point is tad bit on the pricier side for what you get; One stuffed portabell for $11.99!.  The service overall is solid and the atmosphere is fun! - Enjoy",

The upstairs loft seats about 20-30 people easily and had its own bar service (big plus). They catered snacks like wings, mellow balls (excellent), and other finger foods which made for a pleasant, casual atmosphere. The beer selection was expansive and had something to suit everyone's tastes.  Decorations were movie-themed and fun. Overall a very casual atmosphere. The staff were friendly and accommodating (example: they did not have a drink available upstairs so they ran downstairs to get it for me).  Parking lot is huge, so no worries there!  Definitely recommend it for a nice happy hour or group lunch/dinner!",

The private upstairs lounge and party package suited our party (~30 adults and 10 kids), with room to spare and plenty of leftovers for all the guests.  Providing a private batender and staff, along with the allowance for my wife to suspend, and destroy, a large pinata allowed the whole event to come together. Thank you all so much. Everyone had a marvelous time.  Cheers!",

If I were to pin it down to one particular thing, it's the crust, I don't know how they make it, but it is always that perfect balance between soft and crunchy, without being too much of either.  While I'm not a huge fan of all of their specialty pizza's, they offer a huge ingredient selection, and as much customization as you could ask for. While I don't drink much beer, their rotating taps are insane in the number of options, which change all the time.  One thing I like is the service, which is always on point, friendly, and fast.  Staff remember your name if you're a regular, know what to offer, and will give recommendations on drinks, food, and whether something is actually worth ordering.  Taste is a subjective thing, of course, but describe what you're looking for, and chances are they'll give it to you.",

It was really gross to see people's drinks sitting on a mat infested with flys. I will not be going back here. The pizza was decent but not something to rave over. The bartender didn't even attempt to clean the bar or anything. Disgusting.",

Since Corey, their bar manager left for another location, the selection has really gone downhill as his replacement does not appear to have the same knowledge and love of the industry. Very disappointing as this used to be my all time favorite place to meet with friends and enjoy the best craft beers around.",

I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place, and the food that was coming out to other patrons looked just fine. The Beer Selection is quite good with several local breweries being represented, which is always a plus for me. My only complaint is that with a selection that good they do not offer Beer Flights. This should be a NO BRAINER, they are huge money generators for any good Beer Bar, and this is one of the only ones I have been to that doesn't offer them. My suggestion to management and corporate is to get with the times, and offer flights, many Beer Lovers like myself wanna try various beers without having to commit to full pints. Trust Me, you WILL Make Money!",

Great ownership!!!   _________________________________  We've been to other Mellows before and frequent the Tempe location very often. We went to this specific location (12/18/15) for a birthday party the was taking place at Wild Horse. Wanting to get out of the casino atmosphere for a spell, some of us Uber'd it to this Mellow. Our waitress was good. Food was good. This was where the praise stops. The bar manager is clueless and can't run a lemonade stand at a garage sale. His happy hr menus was riddle with False advertising. It was happy hour so we steered clear of the 5 clearly marked no happy hour beers. We orders SEVEN beers (not designated no hh on the menu) only to have our poor waitress come back each time stating it wasn't hh eligible. Finally the incompetent bar manager came out to us blaming the poor waitress for not knowing what beers were hh exempt. We quickly dismissed this- then them manager said it was b/c the no hh wouldn't fit on the menu. What?! I know this is the same ownership as other valley MM why is this one ran so poorly? We were very frustrated so we told our other friends that were going to join us to stay at the casino and we quickly Uber'd it out of there. This MM needs help! Maybe Keith from Tempe needs to go fix them, something need to be done. We'll never return to this location and pray that the new Mellow going up isn't ran this poorly. False advertising and deferring blame is unacceptable! This bar manager needs help and training!!",

Toppings stopped at least 2 inches from edge of crust and were all concentrated in 2 small areas of the pizza. There was literally no sauce at all, almost no cheese and the alleged thin crust was doughy and extremely chewy. I'm giving benefit of the doubt and telling myself this was done by a novice employee who had no idea at all what they were doing but in even in that scenario you'd think someone would be monitoring the finished product.

I've heard of it before, but never eaten here, so I thought I would give it a try.    My friends and I came in on Saturday night and grabbed dinner.  There were four of us total and we were seated right away.  The place is decorated like a movie theatre, which I really liked. Place is spacious with plenty of seating. Two of my friends split a pizza with drinks, while I went with half a steak and cheese sandwich with chips.  Other friend went with a calzone and drinks as well.  The food came out and we all seemed to like it. Service was awesome, and the waitress was really attentive, which we liked.  Our drinks were always full, food was served promptly, and the menu had a great selection of items to choose from.  I got enough chips, but I felt like I got the bottom of the bag as most were smashed under the big ones.  I ended up not getting a drink myself, but they have a great beer selection from what I noticed.  I found the drink prices to be a bit high, but not outrageous.  $7 for a beer and about $10 for mixed drinks.  I don't know if they have happy hour or not, but I would probably go if they did.  I tried one of my friends beers, and it was tasty.  Overall, we had a really good time here. I don't think it's the best food I've ever had, but I enjoyed my time and would return in the future for more.",

    "text": "I ain't gonna lie, their pizza isn't my favorite. It's creative and interesting though! But this review isn't about the pizza, because that's really a matter of personal preference. I want to talk about the people.   I'm a beer guy. I love microbrews and craft beer. Mellow has an ever changing (and extensive) list of beers on tap, and while my favorites aren't always available, I have faith that they will cycle through again. Taphunter can help you find any number of places that have excellent beers on tap. What it doesn't tell you is that your bartender can be part of that experience.  John, Corey, Lola, and the rest of the gang (that I don't know on a first name basis) are really why I come here. Not only are they top notch barkeeps, but they know their stuff. I've walked in and, without a word, been presented with a bottle to try. The suggestions have never failed to amaze.  The regulars are a community as well. These aren't your typical bar-flies. They are cool people with a passion for good drink. They are colorful, diverse, and full of stories.   You might even happen in when a brewery rep is in, pimping the product. It's a great way to learn about what is up and coming.  It's no exaggeration to say that I love this place. If you owned a bar, this is the kind of place you would want to have.",

I asked for it to be sent back and was told I could only have a 16 ounce replacement because I drank some of the beer  Really?

Sent the beer back without drinking it.  Let's see if they take it off!  Not the way to have repeat business.",

    "text": "My family and I came here to venture out from our normal pizza parlor. I have got to say that they decorations inside are really cute and fun which gave me a great vibe of the place. It was a nice, warm afternoon so we decided to sit outside on the patio.   Im giving this restaurant 3 stars for several different reasons. The first one being our waiter and although he seemed like a nice guy, he didn't seem too focused on working. It being our first time at this place, we had a several questions about the menu and/or entrees and he didn't really give us an answer. He seemed lost or tuned out and kind of just reply \" yeah yeah thats good\"  and not really describe what some of the pizzas were, etc. We decided to order just a regular pizza and a salad and they brought out the salad first, cool.   We had finished our salad and was waiting for our pizza to come out. 30 minutes later we were still waiting and our waiter would either run by us or speed walk while telling us our pizza was coming soon. He wouldn't even stop or make eye contact to tell us, just speed on by. 45 minutes later our pizza still wasn't out which made us angry and hungry.  The manager did come out to tell us they had lost our ticket and were working on making another pizza. Not really the greatest thing to happen to first time customers. About 10 minutes later the pizza did come out and the manager ended up giving us a discount for all our troubles. However the pizza was not that good enough to make me want to come back. Especially because of our waiters lack of attention to our table and the kitchen being disorganized.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times but my experiences haven't been consistent. The first time I went was a good experience. The food was yummy (although nothing extraordinary), fast and friendly service by our male server (unfortunately don't remember his name otherwise I would give him a shoutout), and we were in and out within 45 minutes.  I recently went again around lunchtime and we were seated promptly by the hostess outside on the patio. It wasn't busy. About 10 minutes passed as people around us were greeted. The servers were very obviously ignoring our table for whatever reason. Finally one of them comes and says \"Have you guys been helped yet?\" Well, given that no one has acknowledged our existence yet... So without an apology she takes our order. Our drinks were brought quickly, but the food (one medium-sized pizza) took about 25 minutes. Our drinks were never refilled. Someone else brought out our pizza - it was another male server who was also very friendly and helpful and didn't hesitate to bring us what we needed. The original server didn't bother to speak to us again until she brought the bill. It took 15 minutes total for us to pay our bill. Which, I might add, was almost $25 for one medium pizza.  This would have been a much better review had it not been for the lousy service we received as well as the over-priced menu. Overall, wouldn't recommend to a friend. There are plenty of other great pizza places in the area to chose from.",

    "text": "Was I impressed? Nah. But, if you're looking for a pizza joint that's a step-up from the chains then Mellow Mushroom would be an OK choice.  We didn't dine-in, but instead placed a Yelp order for pretzel bites, hummus w/ pita, chicken salad sandwich, a kids cheese, and a Veg Out pizza.  The pretzel bites were hot, soft, and golden brown, but I didn't like the beer cheese dipping sauce.  It was gritty and reminded me of a floury roux.  The taste was different than other beer cheese dips.  I ended up using another cheese dip I had on-hand. The hummus The hummus was pretty good.  It wasn't over blended and had a kick of paprika. My son liked the cheese pizza, but it wasn't his favorite.  The Veg Out pizza was layered with a lot of fresh veggies on top of a red sauce and mellow pizza dough.  The biggest disappointment was the chicken salad sandwich. It was horrible and was far from expectations.  It wasn't chicken salad at all, but slices of chicken on thin sandwich bread, one leaf of weak lettuce.  No flavor, dry, and one I would encourage others to avoid in the future.  Would I order from here again?  Most likely not.  There are other places in the area that offer better quality and flavors.",

Place is huge, we picked a booth, the bar was already full and it wasn't even 5pm.  Menu is huge but since we came for pizza we concentrated on those pages.  A medium size thin crust pizza, half pepperoni and sausage and 1/2 caramelized onions and trio of grilled mushrooms, plus two small salads ( House and Greek).  Thanks to Yelp, we also got a free pretzel bite with cheese dip $7.59 value). We asked for a side of marinara sauce too. It didnt take much time before our pretzle bites made it to our table.  They taste very nice, warm with just a bit of salt, cheese sauce was warm as well.  They tasted free too, lol!  Our salads were next and they were huge!  There were tons of different veggies and all was very fresh and crisp.   Lastly came our pizza! I absolutely loved the thin crust, it was really thin, tasty and loaded with our toppings.  I wouldn't call the onion \"caramelized\" but it was cooked well.  I had two slices, half of my salad, the rest l took home.  Ron's house salad was also wholesome, he enjoyed his pep/sausage pizza but wasn't impressed with the sausage quality.  Overall l liked my experience here and will return!",

It appeared to be a waitress but it was hard to tell because she didn't have an employee shirt or apron. She was extremely nice though and appeared to be training someone. She gave me lots of recommendations until I settled on a GF house special which did not disappoint! You know how sometimes the crust gets too soggy? Well this one remained pretty crunch throughout my meal. Not sure how it would reheat in a microwave but in an oven I imagine just fine!",

It was their signature Holly Shiitake pizza, granted it was an excellent pie but $30 is outrageous.  So with that pie and a pepperoni one it was a $50 bill for 2 pizzas.",

After waiting a while, the pizza came out and a calzone other than the meatball calzone that we ordered. They said there was a mistake and would make the meatball one still but it would be a few minutes. Then the manager came over to apologize and said that they would bring out the correct calzone and take it off the bill. I really appreciated that.   Then i had a 50 dollar groupon that i was trying to use so his taking the calzones off helped us get more food that we used for dinner and lunch the next day. As a bonus i got to keep my meatball calzone and the wrong one that they brought to the table. I brought it home for my wife and she loved it.   I was really impressed with how the manager handled the situation. Bravo Mellow Mushroom...we will be back for sure!",

The hostess was not very welcoming or personable. The waiter was decent but his appearance was not very well put together. The most disturbing part was the music that was being played. It was as if someone had their own personal playlist going over the loud speakers. Worst of all was the rap music; don't get me wrong I listen to rap music all the time but I don't want to go into a restaurant and hear songs that talk about strippers, hoes, sh*t, nig*as and bit*hes. Totally inappropriate and unacceptable and it was kind of uncomfortable. Was there no one in a management type position to regulate that?",

    "text": "What a disappointment. Met up with some family tonight and thought we'd give this place a try since we've heard such great things about other locations. We ordered the pretzels and cheese which absolutely did not live up to the hype; the pretzels were just bread sticks shaped into twisted pretzel shapes. They lacked any and all characteristics of a pretzel. Not chewy, not boiled... we specified \"salt\", too, but I couldn't detect any salt. They were blah pretzel-shaped breadsticks. And the cheese sauce (for $3.49 extra) was lukewarm with a skin on it and was totally bland.   I ordered a cheese calzone with pepperoni, tomatoes, and basil. It made it to the table (five to ten minutes before any of the other entrees) without the requested pepperoni. I dug in anyway and wow, talk about a blah-stravaganza. They must use the cheapest cheese they can possibly find-- it tasted like nothing. Like flavorless glue. Like generic skim milk cafeteria cheese. The calzone crust reminded me of uncooked wheat sandwich bread. It was really bad. I tried to doctor it up with salt, pepper, red pepper, and parmesan (anything on the table, basically), ate maybe four bites and set it aside.   My husband ordered a side salad with blue cheese dressing, so obviously it arrived with ranch dressing. He also ordered a small BBQ chicken pizza, ate two slices, and gave up. He and I shared a to-go box out of habit but we literally threw the whole thing in the trash when we got home. Neither one of us wanted to revisit those meals.   Another person we were with ordered a pizza-- half Gourmet White and half Magical Mystery Tour-- and she literally ate like three bites. Her husband ordered the avocado sub and only ate half. We all looked around at each other and admitted everything was subpar. And we never say that! We're honestly not that picky, but usually if one little thing goes wrong we'll just blaze ahead and fake complete satisfaction. Not tonight.   Service was okay, not stellar. Aside from getting several points of our order wrong, our server (though she did, to her credit, visit our table five or six times over the course of our meal) neglected to ask about bar drink refills until we'd already finished our meal. I could've used another beer after the appetizer, not as I was gearing up to leave. And the rest of the table felt the same.   Overall I'm pretty disappointed. I won't be back. There are too many easy, similarly priced options in the Valley for great pizza (LGO, The Parlour, I'm looking at you) to condemn myself to this again.",

As I headed towards the screen, a young man stopped me and asked, \"could he help us?\"  My daughter said, \"yes, this is our first time here and we'd like to order a pizza.\"  He said, \"ok, right this way.\"  and lead us to the bar where the young woman Stephanie was busy talking to what seemed to be a co-worker.  Maybe not.  She comes down, she gives says, \"What can I do for you girls?\"  That was mistake number 2.  I've already let the fact that we were not acknowledged go,  I'm sure being called a girl to most is flattering, but when I'm old enough to be your mother, it's not.  I did correct her and say \"ladies.\"   Don't judge, today I chose to be petty.  My 30 year old daughter didn't want me to choose that direction.  She's from a different era than I.  She said she will handle it with corporate.  \"What ever!\"  So, to make a long story short (lol) The service was an absolute terrible!  But the pizza was good.  Would have been better if I didn't taste resentment (angry face).",

Ordered 2 medium pizzas, (cant remeber which kind) the Groupon should have covered $20, however I still had to pay an additional $25.  This was takeout so nothing else was ordered.  So my overall total was around $45 for 2 medium pizzas that in the end tasted like pizza patron anyways.  Thanks but no thanks, this place is too expensive!",

The dough had a moist, dense, chewy texture, which I didn't mind but my husband and son were wishing we'd gone to Oreganos (actually, they would've preferred Pizza Hut for those prices!)  Tried the Mellowterranean pizza which was quite bland with very few toppings and the turkey & cheese hoagie on rye pretzel bread (completely devoid of flavor--how hard is it to offer mustard or mayo?)  The \"pretzels\" are just pizza dough twisted into pretzel shapes. Since they were hot and salty, I'd have to say that was the highlight of the meal.  Ambience is nothing special; don't quite understand the movie theatre theme as it's really only the entry area. The large booths are nice the back seating area is wide open to the kitchen, which can provide entertainment in the form of swirling pizzas and tossed dough but it also means we see that pimpled teens are cooking the food and not really caring if the dough hits the ceiling. Yikes.  A Groupon enticed us to try it but nothing will likely get us to go back I'm afraid....",

That NEVER happens! I was really impressed with that! I also ordered bruschetta as an appetizer and that was just \"o.k.\" .The pizza was really good along with their fruit flavored beer!

I am in Tempe on business and have been horribly disappointed with the beer selections of most of the restaurants and bars in the area...until I found Mellow Mushroom.  I am a proud beer snob (cicerone cert) and I must say that whoever is doing their beer ordering is 100% on point.  I didn't try the food, so take this review as you will.  If you are looking for a place that serves world class beer you must come here.  I tried some of the local selections (four peaks) and wasn't impressed, but quickly found Ninkasi Vanilla Oatis which is a close to perfect vanilla bean stout.  Usually when a beer snob goes into a sub-par beer place they are met with either disdain or ignorance.  My bartender, Cody, was fantastic.  I was never dry, he was quick with samples and gave me a short rundown of the local breweries when I told him I wasn't from Arizona.  I took away 1 star just because the beer was waaaay too cold (I think they frost their glassware which is a big no no in craft beer).  My Ninkasi stout came out with no head and freezing cold (blasphemy for such a great stout)  I will definitely be back on my week long stay.  Cheers Mellow Mushroom.",

The food is terribly bland, I got the jerk chicken sandwich which just tasted over peppered as to mask the blandness all stuffed  in a soggy lukewarm bun, accompanied by a greasier version of lays. It seems like they are cheap since they can't even offer real fries as a a side. It's the very  it's the least they can do considering that  they are charging 11 dollars for a blandwich. It took over 20 minutes to get an appetizer salad and soup to the table. Seems rather odd since it was empty on a Saturday night which leads me to another point there was no music playing so all you could hear awkward silence followed by the occasional person speaking, I've been to funerals livelier than this place. It took at least 30 minutes to finally get our food we had to ask our waiter 3 times for ranch but he seemed distracted he said he got sidetracked, which I don't understand considering this place was super dead.The manager did come and apologize for the delay, but it's like don't be sorry, just be better. Which based on every other critical review leads me to believe this is not the case. This was my first time coming here and probably my last. So if you like being disappointed by all means come here.",

    "text": "I wanted to try this place based on the reviews of the pretzels from a friend.   We came in for dinner with a buddy of ours. Our friend ordered a beer but when the waitress brought it she said they were out of what he wanted but the bartender poured something else to try. Eh, I wasn't a fan of that idea. He had a second beer in mind he would have ordered if she simply said they were out. Instead he was stuck with a Dale's Pale Ale and he's never been a fan. So that was a waste of money, since he didn't want to be rude and ask her to dump it and get him something else. Our server also wasn't the best at refilling our soda/waters.   I ordered the garlic butter and parmesan pretzels with beer cheese for the table. Three pretzels, three of us...it seemed like fate (although, I wish there had been 4 so I could have had 2). They were awesome!! Cooked perfectly, the beer cheese was so good I would have licked the container clean if I had been on my couch and not in public.   Each of the guys ordered a pizza. One had the Thai Dye which was tasted much better than it sounded, I can't remember what our buddy ate.  I ordered the stuffed portabella mushroom as an entree. Their pizzas came out a good 7-8 minutes before my mushroom so they were almost done eating before I got my dinner. Nothing worse than staring at your friends eating while you sit there with nothing in front of you. When our server came to check on us she didn't seem concerned that I didn't have my dinner yet, just assured me it was coming. Keep in mind it took FOREVER to get our pizzas in the first place.  Finally my dinner arrived and it was YUMMY! I engulfed it in as few as 4 bites and caught right up to the guys. I would definitely order this again!   I understand the hype for the pretzels and despite the fact my mushroom was great (you can't really screw up a mushroom) nothing was phenomenal. The service was lacking. She kept disappearing for a long time, our drinks went unfilled, we were stuck with beers we never would have ordered but had to pay for, and our food didn't come out at the same time, nor did it arrive in a timely manner.   The next time I'm in the mood for pizza, it won't be for this place. I might be willing to try it again but it will not be my first choice.",

    "text": "This is a regular Happy Hour stop for us. You can't beat the half price beers and appetizers.  So, when they announced that they would be doing breakfast, we were intrigued. This Saturday morning we decided to give it a try. Now, Ahwatukee has some real good breakfast places so for MM to compete, it had to be good. Not only was it good, it was fantastic.  I ordered The Usual of which I had 3 eggs scrambled with cheese, the sausage patties and house potatoes. Everything was delisious, especially the sausage patties, which I believe they make. They are maple infused and a bit spicy.  The wife had the short stack which ended up being a very generous serving of yummy pancakes.  We also ordered French Press coffee which was fantastic and enough for us both.   I wasn't surprised how good it was because we already enjoy Mellow Mushroom for Happy Hour, Lunch and Dinner. I was surprised however that the place was not packed!  If you are reading this review and want to explore another great breakfast joint in Ahwatukee, give Mellow Mushroom a try. We will be back for sure.",

Mellow Mushroom offers a varied selection of entree's and brews. I chose the lunch special: 8\" pepperoni pizza for $4.99. I added one topping and a drink for a total of $9.24.   My lunch arrived in 15 minutes. My entree was piping hot with plenty of mozzarella, sauce and toppings. The crust was soft and flavorful as was the sauce and toppings   The service was exceptional. The pizza was delicious. I can't wait to go back for my next fix.",

We also frequently order the special baked potato pizza with no onions. It's nice to eat on the outdoor patio when the weather is nice. Good service as well. This restaurant is movie-themed and has fun decorations such as a chandelier in the front/lobby, movie theater seats for the waiting area (which we have rarely ever waited for a table, which is a plus), and a large dinosaur statue near the back. The booth seating is comfortable as well. They also have trivia nights on Tuesday where you can earn gift cards if you win. I haven't been able to attend yet, but I bet it's fun. They also have an upstairs level for special events I believe.",

However, in Phoenix, AZ Mellow Mushroom is experimenting w/a breakfast menu M-F 7-10AM SIS 7-1 PM   My wife and I decided to try it out today after reading some good reviews about it! I can honestly say, their breakfast menu is AWESOME! I had Biscuits and Gravy w/3 eggs. My wife had the Breakfast sandwich with \"smashed red potatoes\". They're AWESOME too. They had MANY nice menu items. I was pleasantly surprised!  Another thing, if you order coffee, they only serve French Press Coffee! None of that CRAPPY bar coffee! It smelled so good!   I've eaten lunch here and highly recommend it! But I SWEAR, we'll be back for breakfast again!   I how Mellow Mushroom in your area sees breakfast. If they do, I highly recommend it!   We went to the Ahwatukee location and Tony our server was absolutely wonderful and it's been an all-around GREAT experience! If you live in Ahwatukee area, you won't regret coming here for breakfast!",

From the parking lot we see 3 hostesses all chatting at the booth, my husband, our 4 year old son, 5 month old daughter (holding in car seat) and I were walking up and they stood there as if we were interrupting an important conversation.  Nowadays when we eat at restaurants and taverns it seems like if it's not busy the hostess usually open the door. Let alone 3 hostesses just chatting. Food and drinks are always amazing and delicious, which keeps us returning!  Servers are always sweet but our favorite server Patrick no longer works there.  I appreciate great customer service and recognize and compliment it when I see it but when it really underwhelms for common sense purposes it's easily fixable!  Thanks for being our Friday night family date night!",

We like to get the whole wheat pizza, and pretzels with beer cheese. FYI, the pretzels are whole pretzels, not little pieces like at the Tempe location . It was just two of us so we totally felt like little oinkers with 6 big pretzels and a pizza! Lol! The pretzels are made from their dough so I'm sure the 4 were taking home will be really good left over. We made sure to ask to take home some of the beer cheese because it is the BEST. The only negative is that we sat waiting for our sever without waters for almost 15 minutes, seems no one knew who's table we were. However, I will not give 1 less star because they quickly remedied this problem when my husband asked to talk to the manager. Overall, good place and we'll be back (on next cheat day) :-)",

We looked over the menu and the pizzas seemed over priced to us. About an avearage of $12.95 for a 10\" pizza which cuts into four slices. We decided to go for the hoagies since they were less expensive and a good way to try out the restaurant. The wait staff was polite but not very attentive.   The food and service was a disappointment. We waited about 30 minutes for our two hoagies on rye bread. The restaurant was not very busy at about a third full so we did not understand why it took so long. Once we recieved our hoagies the bread was slightly burned and very dry. They were tasty but the burnt bread made it a disappointment.   Our waitress took our orders and did not check back with us afterward. I see this as a management failure, since if I were to train the staff I would make sure that they check on guest during a 15 minute interval to make sure they are getting their food on time. She took our order and checked with us twice after we got it. Never explaining why it took 30 minutes to make two hoagies.   Overall I would not recommend this restaurant and we will not be going back. I was hoping for a better experience since it was a light lunch crowd.",

    "text": "This was the worst customer service that I have received in Phoenix. Initially I was super excited about eating here because I was hungry.  When we arrived at the restaurant there was no one in the front. We looked around to see if there is anyone around. The hostess came and helped the couple in front of us but did not come back to help us. We went inside and one of the bartenders helped us get a table. When we ordered we were not greeted with friendliness. The server forgot to put our appetizer order. The pizza that we ordered came semi cold. You can tell it's been sitting there for a while. Our drinks were not refilled. We had to tracks someone down to get our server to refill. We looked to see where she was and she was busy watching TV on the screen by the bar. The potatoes we ordered was dry and the menu said caramelized onions. It did not come caramelized. We ended up advising the waitress that we did not want that anymore. The overall taste of the pizza was nothing special. The frozen pizza you would cook from the grocery story tasted much better. The best part of the meal was the Coca Cola and the Sprite that my friend and I ordered.  When we left there was really no customer service and it just seemed like they didn't care much about anything.  I'm not asking for supreme service but at least some kind of service. We left there feeling really unwelcomed.   Would I ever come back here again? Hell to the no!",

The food was fine and  was actually quite good and the service was friendly enough but as I started paying attention to the guys tossing pizza dough I started to notice some disturbing things. First the guy dropped the pizza dough and had to bend over far enough to pick it up that it did not fall on a table top and then continued tossing it. I would have just assumed I misunderstood what I saw but then the guy I dropped the pizza dough on his bearded face ( he was lookijg up as iy fell) and then continued to toss a pizza dough. I'm not sure I can stomach eating there again because I would not want that pizza dough on my plate.",

    "text": "There's an adage that states pizza is like sex; even when it's bad, it's still pretty good.  Mellow Mushroom disproved this theory for me last night.  On this historic night, I had the worst pizza of my life, and I'm dishing out my first ever one-star review.  We ordered a $9 Greek salad.  The thinly cut vegetables (i.e. pizza toppings) weren't plentiful enough to distract us from the fact that the bagged iceberg lettuce was browning.  I did enjoy the creamy Italian dressing, which they named \"esperanza\".  I can't find anything nice to say about the pizza.  It was an abomination.  The crust was uneven and undercooked in places, and it was very sweet with a hint of cinnamon, like eating a cinnamon raisin bagel.  The red sauce was also sweet.  The cheese was plasticky and tasteless.  Each piece of our \"Kosmic Karma\" pie was topped with a Roma tomato slice and a drizzle of pesto sauce, which now seems like a better alternative to the red sauce, but combined to make the pizza soggy.  And to boot, this medium, vegetarian pizza was insanely expensive at $20. Twenty Bucks!  I can say that the service was good, and I liked the decor.  It's a brick, multi-level building, a remnant from the Rock Bottom that was the previous tenant.  I also really liked the movie theater theme of this restaurant, which was pretty cool.  (I found out that each Mellow Mushroom location has a different theme.  I'd been to one other location that had a much weaker theme, but much better food.)  I was anything but Mellow when I left dinner last night.  Regretful Mushroom would be a better name.",

    "text": "I've been going to Mellow Mushroom for a couple years now and have enjoyed it but the service has slowly turned me away. I decided to give it one last tonight and I ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT, be returning. I called in an order for two medium pizzas yesterday night, which upon arrival my friend and I realized they messed up one of the pies. Sadly I filled out the check and left a tip before realizing the mistake. The nice server apologized and explained the TO-GO girl wrote down \"no chicken\" but didn't put it on the order ticket. The server kept apologizing  and said we could keep the messed up pizza. The manager then came up to us at the bar where we were waiting and apologized. He told us that the pizza would be out in 10 minutes and then took away the pizza that the server told us we could keep. After 20 minutes of waiting at the bar our other pizza was cold and we hadn't even been offered water.  We finally got the pizza, and what bothered me the most is they couldn't even give us a discount or follow up with their word for letting us keep the pizza. I paid $50 dollars for a 20 minute wait, a cold pizza, and an under cooked pizza. We got back to my friends house and realized the pizza they remade was still doughy and undercooked. The manager at that location is one of the reasons why I have stopped coming, I've had encounters with him where he was just so rude. He's not a friendly person at all. Another thing that rubs me the wrong way is the way the management responds to their bad Yelps. They give a simple \"Sorry for your bad experience, hope you give us another try!\" Or \"We'll talk to our waiting staff about this\" which in this case the only waiting staff we encountered yesterday the very polite server. In EVERY restaurant I've worked at if we got a bad Yelp review we'd respond with an offer of a free entree or free dessert or free drinks at the bar (if they didn't enjoy our beer). I get the impression that Mellow Mushroom is just cheap. They do absolutely nothing to try to make things right when they mess up, and that leaves a sour taste in my mouth. They don't seem to care about what their customers think. I will NOT be giving Mellow Mushroom another try, I'll stick to Pita Jungle. Cheers!",

    "text": "Okay, so this review kind of breaks my heart. I grew up in Atlanta, and I actually went to HS with the daugher of one of the first starters of this restaurant. I absoltutely. LOVE LOVEEEE Mellow Mushroom - in Atlanta.  The moment I heard there was one near my house, well of COURSE I had to go! I ve gone twice. The prices are comprable to the Atlanta prices so I knew what to expect - but in Atlanta it's so good that  you don't mind paying the high prices even thought there is A LOT of Pizza competition. I've even had it in D.C. and  Charlotte -it's pretty darn good there too. But, the owners in AZ are MISSING THE MARK.    My Gripes  1) It just isn't good. I am not a fan of Oregano's too sweet for me. But at least at Oreganos they USE OREGANO. Sigh. Use seasoning and definately use salt.   2)Never call that pretzel thing a prezel (parmesean and garlic). You can get the same thing -6 of them- at Little Cezars for  3.99 :(. It needs a little salt or something? And, more fizz, less pizza crust like??!?   3) Use organic cheese. If I am spening almost 32 dollars for a large Pie (Shatakii mushroom and shrimp) .. I expect organic, not low budget.  4) Lower your prices: If you aren't going to make mouth watering; I just came out of heaven pizza, there is no way in the WORLD  I am going to spend this sort of money for a larger version of DiGiorno's frozen pizza. sIGH   5) Never EVER order the salad. That too was almost 10 dollars. And ... not really a lot of salad. I've gotten better from the Habit. :/.",

It was an uncooked paste of flour and margarine, their interpretation of a roux mixed with an abundance of balsamic vinegar and uncooked onions topped with a few mushrooms.    Chicken salad sandwich: Sarah Lee oatmeal bread with three ounces of chicken salad, $9.  The chicken curry salad had no taste or seasoning, not even salt and pepper.  Cranberries in the salad but literally no nuts as were said on the menu.    I don't like the pizza, but I'm not the biggest fan of pizza.  There cheese sauce is basically all flour combined with Velveta, very disappointing.    I am throwing down the red flag and surrendering.  Mellow Mushroom is utterly disgusting.",

Not a fan of the Service as the server was pretty rude (my husband & I felt so)  Visited mellow mushroom for the first time and I Ordered a large 3 topping pizza, cheesy garlic bread, chicken calzone (for hubby) & bbq chicken wings for hubby aswell,  The 3 topping pizza was huge and average in taste. I asked to replace the usual mozzarella cheese for fresh mozzarella but when it arrived it didn't seem like what I asked for was followed despite of paying extra for it - server argued that's how it's supposed to be (well I have had fresh mozzarella as a topping before at a different restaurant and it's nowhere close).  We hated the garlic bread - couldn't spot a single piece of garlic and definitely couldn't taste garlic - not even garlic powder. We ended up confirming with the server if it was garlic bread by saying we couldn't taste but she didn't offer to look into it.  Husband loved his wings but didn't quite like the calzone as it lacked flavor.  Nothing was wow at this place. Overpriced average tasting pizza. Probably that's why it wasn't crowded even on a long weekend. Definitely not returning..",

Although I placed an order to go, the staff were accommodating and threw different people asked if I wanted water while I waited. We joked about staying hydrated due to the awful heat.  The pizza was a large 8 piece meaty which had tons of flavor. The crust, my least fav on most pizzas, was soft had great flavor too. I'll be back with friends this Sunday!",

His friend is some kind of pizza expert.  I sort of think of myself as a pizza connoisseur... and here is what I thought.  - super cool decor, big, spacey, lots of movie memorabilia... loved it - service was great, we had a gal that was super on point and very attentive... despite having like 6 or 7 tables (not sure how she did it, she was pretty amazing) - food - okay.  Yup, just okay.  The salad we split was drenched in dressing and the lettuce limp.  The pretzel bites were actually the best part of the meal.  The pizza was almost like Peter Piper level for grown ups?   - value = solid.  It was definitely not the best pizza I have ever had, but not the worst either.  I think this place would be cool to have a big party or private event as they space is nice and the pricing not inflated.",

    "text": "Daughter has talked about Mellow Mushroom in Tampa, and swears by them. I am not into national chain business, but I decided to try this out anyway. We first went in when they started serving breakfast. I have not ordered much from the breakfast menu, but the biscuits are HUGE. I get the biscuit with the strawberries. DH gets what ever breakfast he feels like. He has ordered everything on the breakfast menu. Everything he has been happy with, except he would not recommend the smashed potatoes. They smell heavenly and are presented well, but we just don't like the taste. The potatoes are a little dry, which does not make sense, but they are dry to us. Everything else he totally enjoyed. Welcome to the new breakfast choice in Ahwatukee!  On our last visit we finally went to the restaurant for pizza and beer. Shiitake mushroom pizza, YEA!!! It was good. We also ordered the cheesy bread, not fans. We are cheese bread snobs, so that could be the case. I ordered the Enlightened Spinach Salad. Wow! Loved the bowl and the salad had so many flavors. Highly recommend it. As for the pizza, you can order vegan cheese for it, and it was good! The beer selection at this location is extensive and very crafty. The bar tender, who I cannot remember his name has contacts with all the good beer people (real craft beers) so he had some great recommendations. Dh will definitely keep going for the beer and I like the food. The wait staff is fun and lively. We have sat all over the restaurant, but have not been there when the upper room is open. That is on my list to sit up there, but one day soon it will happen.  The restaurant is clean outside and in. The staff even when busy are happy and work well together. That makes a big difference in a national chain restaurant. Happy employees make customers happy. Great job Mellow Mushroom. The staff at this location is quite happy!   They have more vegan friendly options. I have no doubt it will only get better.",

They have an upstairs which is crazy, I wanted to go up there and check it out, distracted.    We started with an appetizer, we started with Garlic Cheese Bread, there was a lot more there than I anticipated, and it was delicious.    For Dinner we decided to split a Calzone and a whole order of Hot Wings.  First we loaded the Calzone with Sausage, Black Olives. and Mushrooms, it was to die for, the plan was to take half or it home, and have leftovers for lunch the next day.  Hardest thing I've ever had to do. If your thinking the same thing, STOP, don't punish yourself like I did.  The Hot Wings were really good, I would definitely order them again.    We had a fun evening, I enjoyed their music selection, and it wasn't overpowering were we couldn't hear each other, it was just right.    The best part was the staff, they are amazing, we will be back sooner than we should be.  They are now serving breakfast so we are going to check it out!",

The food has been subpar as well.   Last night, 8-3-19 around 11:00 pm, my daughter, her husband, and myself stopped in for a bite to eat after a concert. The bar and dining area was not overly busy. We sat down at a table and a sever came over to take our drink order. She slammed the menus on the table and gruffly asked what we wanted to drink. She came back with our drinks and we waited 15 minutes for her to take our order. When she did, she gruffly said \"you know what you want?\"    We had to ask for drink refills several times during the night. We also had to hunt her down for take home boxes and our check. We could never get her name, however she was blonde and wearing a black leather vest.   My family attends many concerts and plays which leaves us few choices for late night dining. The Ahwatukee Mellow Mushroom has always been one of our favorites since it's on our way home. However, with declining service, we will be finding another restaurant.",

We ordered 3 toppings large pizza, which was okay but not great. I had better pizza elsewhere. 3 we ordered the wings which was good and liked it. Even though the menu said the 3 toppings large pizza was $24.76. The bill amount came out to be $26.75 we were confused so we asked the waitress why the discrepancy? She was very rude and said this is how we charge and got us the menu back. Later when I was checking the menu one of the toppings we had ordered was double the regular topping price. She could have told us that instead of saying this is how we charge and it's charged correctly. Anyway not a good experience overall. I doubt I'll go again. If I do definitely not at this location.",

The best part is almost everything on the menu can be made vegan because they have a vegan cheese! Their dough is also vegan! There were many options for toppings including a grilled mushroom trio with black truffle oil and base options such as pesto and garlic olive oil.  I liked it so much I split the teriyaki tofu hoagie with a friend and then took a pizza home. Highly recommend this spot!",

She ordered the veg out with the vegan cheese.   I loved my pizza. I got the veg out, no tomatoes, add pepperoni & salami. My pizza was perfectly cooked and flavorful.   The staff here were kind and had a real smile on their faces.  The building was clean and the music at the perfect volume. The bathroom was fairly clean, granted we came after the lunch rush.

However, the overall quality of the experience is seriously lacking.  For the first time, last evening, my family and I chose to dine in the restaurant (not the bar).  We waited 5-6 minutes at the hostess station until an underwhelming goth-like teen, lacking facial expression, appeared.  She was so unobservant -- she brought our 7 year old a regular menu and then, after realizing the 3 foot tall skinny blonde was a child, asked her if she would like a kids menu.    We then sat at the table for 10 minutes without so much as a glance in our direction from any wait staff.  The young teen hostess cleared the table next to ours, and seemed unaware that we remained seated without service.  There were tables being served all around us -- yet, we sat there.  A young man, covered (from neck to arm-sleeve) in tattoos walked by us after about 12 mins and let us know he would be right with us.  But then failed to acknowledge us again -- although, he walked past the table a dozen times in the following 10 minutes.  No one seemed to notice when we got up and simply left 22 mins after we arrived, nary a water on the table.",

Their pizza is good, but it isn't anything amazing. They have unique toppings and combinations on a pretzel crust, but their sauces are pretty flat/one-note in flavor. Their service is fine, but we have never received great service. There are a ton of tvs above the bar that you can see from almost anywhere in the restaurant so you can keep tabs on the game if you want (and one of them is ALWAYS on the food channel for you non-sports people).

They were semi busy, but we were seated right away. Server (Brendan, I believe) was very nice, and prompt. Started with the artichoke spinach dip, literally the best ive ever had, anywhere. Served with pita bread, it was SO good. Generous portion too, I thought. Or maybe I thought that because I had it to  myself as the kiddo didn't want any lol. He got the pizza kids meal. Sorta boring options on that end, but he didn't complain. I got the white pizza minus the onions. Very good. Thought the pizza was kinda pricey, but since we had to groupon it cut down the cost. I ordered some beer with the name \"vanilla\" in it, but pretty sure I was brought something else. 2 things I thought were a bit off, his kids meal came out even before the appetizer, and I was never brought a plate for my pizza so I had to eat it off the pan. Over all, I liked the place. Extremely clean inside, and friendly staff. I will be back, but probably not without another groupon.",

Came here at around 12:00 on a monday which was extremely slow (There were 2 other customers there). We were seated within minutes of arrival & our server brought drinks over. The beers we ordered (5 of us) took about 10 mins or so, the food that we ordered though took up the WHOLE lunch hour! Now if it were busier I get it, but we had come here before for a work lunch for their soft opening (with a full restaurant) & had much faster service...  Now the beer cheese pretzels are a must. We also got the House Special & the Mighty Meaty, both of which were delish. I really like Mellow, I do, but please get your service up to par & then I will update my review.",

    "text": "Over-priced, oily, tasteless crap.  My rule of thumb regarding pizza places is that for the $10 Costco combo is the best dollar value, and the Nello's Combo is the best $20 large pizza you can get.  Mellow Mushroom fails across the board.  Last Monday I took a date to the one on 50th street, and ordered a large 50-50; one half being their red potato, and the other Thai-something.  The waiter informs us that as it's baked on stone it till take a bit longer than the usual pizza place.  Fine.  I'm OK with waiting a bit for good crust.  I bake my own at home and it takes all day for the dough to mature.  The delivered result was a mess.  On top of the potato half was a squirt of sour cream that was totally unappetizing.  The Thai half had a squirt of what I can only describe as being similar to that garlic-flavored sauce you get with Domino's breadsticks.  The rest of the pizza was covered with oily cheese.  I wish I could load a photo of the mess so that you could all see this creation.  My date ate one slice and I was able to choke down 2.  I had the rest packed into a box for later, thinking that maybe we were halucinating this monstrousity.  After spending the night in the fridge, I nuked up a slice, held it up and watched the oil drip off.  This thing isn't worthy of human consumption, unless you consider the county fair \"Deep Fry Fantasy\" as haute cuisine.  Finally, I think the cost of a 22 oz beer was $7.50 (honestly, I've tried to purge the memory of the visit, so I'm probably off on the cost and quantity).  Maybe at Chase field, or the U. of Phoenix Stadium, but at a neighborhood pizza joint?  The pub I usually go to has many of the same beers on tap and a 25 oz is more like $5.50.  But then again, it's not a corporation masquerading as a bunch of enterprising old hippies.  Total bill, with tip was $50+, and that included a $10 off coupon.  I'd have been better off with a $10 Costco combo and a craft beer 6-pack.  Don't worry about contacting me and a mea culpa and coupons.  I won't be darkening your doorstep again.",

Then when he brought out the pizza, it still had everything on it. No manger came out to apologize but I had to ask to speak to the manager. I was a server and it is not a hard job!

Fine. $10 for a salad with iceberg and romaine? $9 for a 3oz pour of a bottle of wine that costs $9 at Fry's? I guess if you don't want the veg and you're more into beer, your value will increase.

Okay here is the simplicity of the salad spinach, feta cheese, chopped candied pecans, dried cherries, cut apples - balsamic dressing ( you can do this at home). Sat at the bar alone meaning the server taking care of the bar was working the floor friendly but not at the bar so my service suffered. Really leaning on the NOT returning side of the fence. Maybe if back in the area, really wasn't a warm fuzzy feeling. Did get a cold beer though! Sure a fancy place for very basic food at a price. No up selling not the best experience - so I would say try it and if it works for you great otherwise I did share my dime's worth.",

    "text": "My friend and I decided to take a chance and try this place this afternoon. Neither of us have been so disappointed and angered with a lunch experience in quite some time.  The food was barely edible and the service was abysmal!  We were seated quickly after being told it would be a 10 minute wait. Our server came by immediately to take drink and food orders. If we had known that would be about the last time we'd see him, I would have given him an agenda for the rest of our meal. Our beers and waters came out quickly but we waited about 30 more minutes for our spinach artichoke dip appetizer. It was gooey and cold with petrified garlic toast but we ate it because we were starving. We sat for another 20ish minutes with empty water and beverage glasses and scraps of our appetizer left that were clearly not going to be eaten. My friend noticed that our server was apparently also the bartender and was chatting up a lady sitting at the bar. Fed up, she went up to him and asked if it was going to be much longer for our calzone. He told her he would check and we watched him scamper up to the window and take a plate that was sitting on an upper shelf. He came back and stated, \"they put it up just as I got there!\" He then proceeded to leave our lukewarm lunch on the table without any offer of clean plates, drink refills for our long empty glasses or 'can I get you anything else?' The cheese that had oozed out of the calzone was cold and waxy. I managed to find a tiny warm spot in the middle. We sadly ate then waited and waited for our waiter to appear which was silly on our part. We asked another server to bring our check which she did quickly and with apologies. Our quick lunch took over an hour and a half. I'll never visit this, or any other Mellow Mushroom based on this experience.",

    "text": "I will call it a 'wow' experience, but only because of the bill @ the end. The cesear pizza salad, was half the size of cpk's version, yet mellow mushroom's cost more ??? I understand they need to make a profit- but that $12.50 personal pizza sized small cesaer pizza salad is outrageously priced.  On the bright side....service was excellent. They have excellent staff, from the hosts to the servers, it was fantastic. If u want to get good customer service, and spend over $55 for 2 beers and two pizzas for 2 people- this is the place. The old Nypd pizza spoiled me. Their prices were much better. If mellow mushroom plans to stay in Ahwatukee for the long term, they may want to revisit their pricing strategy.",

They need fewer tables as the kitchen can't handle the floor.  45 minutes to get appetizer and then meal came out 5 minutes later.  The sandwich had onions which I requested not but luckily they did a poor job and only got it on half.  Wife's salad was sad and disappointing. Manager comped entire meal.   Nice. But don't think we will return.   Wait for $10 coupons to drain if you want to try.  It is a sad thing because it is a good place back home but just not cutting it here in Phx.  A bit pricy even had it been quality which it wasn't in case you missed that.  Really makes us question going out at all. It is so pricy and a crap shoot.",

Our waitress was excellent in directing us with our pizza choices. I ordered half mushroom and half meat lovers. I had noticed the mushroom half had no tomato sauce added. I thought that was strange. The meat portion was very good but the mushroom half was tasteless and really need some more mushrooms. I think there were at least 10 count on the whole four slices. When we got the bill I thought the price was high for a medium half and half pizza. A little over $9 for each half. The brew beer was really good. Probably will not be going back.",

Went there on Sunday specifically because I had a taste for their signature portabello mushroom appetizer.  I am also a big fan of the portabello sandwich, both of which were discontinued.  It's called Mellow mushroom right?  The pizza and wings are okay, but I go there for the mushroom things on the menu.  Can get pizza and wings any number of other places. Why would you all discontinue signature mushroom items on your menu when your establishment is called...the Mellow Mushroom???  Not coming back. Patty",

I'm an IPA guy, and they usually only have about 8 or 9 to choose from. (My use of the word \"only\" is an example of irony.)  Oh, what about the food, you ask? Don't even get me started! I'm pretty sure that the streets of heaven are paved with Mellow Mushroom's pepperoni pizza. The street curbs are whole grain pizza crust and all the skateboarders want to grind on it. The street lamps are made of pretzel bites (stacked one upon the other, clearly) and drizzled in that delicious cheese sauce. . . damn, the cheese sauce is so good. . . now I want pretzel bites. . .

    "text": "This location seems very new and the building is so cool looking.  They tried to make it look like an old movie theater that was converted to a restaurant, so there is lots of movie memorabilia around and also theater eats in the waiting area near the hostess stand.  Other than the decor, me and my friend weren't really wowed by the food.  We ordered the chopped salad, which was basically just a lot of lettuce and not much else (very FEW tomatoes and olives and sunflower seeds).  I don't really get what made it a \"chopped\" salad as differentiated from a regular salad.  Also, the dressing claimed to be a vinaigrette, but what came out was a creamy almost Ranch-like dressing.... odd.  For the pizza we were excited to try vegan cheese bc we can't eat dairy.  The nice thing is that you can sub vegan cheese on any of their pizzas.  But the Daiya cheese they used just isn't very good!  The first bite of it is decent, but after the first bite it starts just tasting weird...  I think I would've preferred a pizza with no cheese than this fake cheese.  If they are going to offer vegan cheese, they should look for a better option or possibly make their own.  I will say I did enjoy the crust of the pizza!  The bread was nice and doughy with a good crispiness to the outside.  Lastly, service was NOT good.  Our poor waitress was really nice, but just overworked.  She forgot to bring us silverware when we sat down and then when our salad arrived, we still didn't have silverware.  And we couldn't flag her down to get any silverware for another 10+ minutes, that's how busy she was!  But then after that she was checking in with us a lot -- of course then we didn't need anything.",

My cycling team chose to hold the team holiday party at MM and from all accounts, everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food. We reserved the upstairs dining area and had ample, comfy seating for our 30 person team.   At the start of the party, the team enjoyed a few appetizers, including wings, hummus and pita, and mini bruschettas. They were all consumed quickly. Our collective order included all kinds of things; my table ordered the 2 kinds of veggie pizzas and both were quite good.   Service was decent, if a bit scattered. However, the staff did their best to match orders with tables and in the end, everyone got what they ordered.  My only criticism is that prices seemed a bit high, especially when compared against Nellos and Oreganos, the 2 other local pizza joints in the neighborhood. Personally, I believe that Nellos and Oreganos offer better value as their prices are lower than MM's and you get more food. However, I would come here again to check out the main dining room area and movie-theme decor.",

I don't think they put too much time into making their sandwiches taste very special. The Avocado sandwich was about as bland and generic as it sounds, not to mention they put onions in the sandwich when she requested no onions.  The italian sandwich was extremely generic/bland and I was hoping that they would have a good one, you can get an equally good or better Italian literally at any restaurant. They put so little vinaigrette on it that I couldn't taste it. They forgot to put on the onions, when I asked for onions I received a bowl full of very large pieces of onion. Pieces way too big to take a bite of and not be overwhelmed. Also, I think it's a bad idea to put Mozzarella on the sandwich, its pretty bland.  Also had pretzel bites that I keep hearing about. The taste like whole wheat (I think they are), maybe some people like that but the taste difference vs white bread is huge, I wouldn't but the pretzel bites again.  Aside from the server, the food was 2/10.",

My son has a medical condition that necessitates the use of a seating aid.

The only thing that kinda sucks about their lunch specials is that they limit the toppings you can order to the mundane options. This is fairly unfortunate because if you would like any of their interesting pizza combinations they cost at least 12-13$ (only come in the larger size).

    "text": "My wife and I are on a low carb diet, so we rarely eat out saving it for when we want to take a break from low carb. This time we decide to go to Mellow mushroom. We had not been in a while and I was missing their french bread Tapenade (which they longer have) When we arrived @ 3:00 pm on a Saturday, there was maybe 6 to 8 cars in the parking lot. Being hungry we thought great we will get right in. We went in and there was a group of about 8 people sitting there and no one at the host station.    We sat down and waited. About 5 minutes goes by and nothing. My wife went in and got someone who seemed to be annoyed to be bothered by the look she gave her and saying someone will be there soon. Are employees not trained to acknowledge when people are kept waiting to apologize for the wait?    We sat for another few minutes and then we were seated, We chose the patio with only 2 other tables occupied. A few more minutes past and Kirsten a very pleasant young lady came out and took our drink order and pepperoni cheese bread and was soon back with our drinks at that time she took our order for our entree a steak salad , a good 10 minutes later she came out and asked if we gotten our bread?  We said no and then another 5 minutes she came back with it. it was another 10 minutes before we got our salad by the way there was not salt or pepper on any of the tables and the table was not the cleanest.    We did not see her until we were almost done with our meal, and my cup almost empty at that point, asking if I wanted a refill I declined as I had only a few more bites, At $3.29 a glass, that seems very very steep for one glass of soda. Knowing that we were almost done we finally had to ask another server for our check which was another 5 minutes before we go it. Knowing when we arrived and looking at the time stamp on the check it literally took an hour for this meal with maybe 7 to 10 tables in the whole restaurant filled.   Reading over the 2 and 3 star reviews on Yelp it seems that service is the main issue with this restaurant when it comes to low ratings, and that issue lies with management. Giving the same response over and over on yelp from the manager again and again rings hollow when nothing is being done about the issue. Had this happened on a busy Friday night this would be totally forgivable and not requiring a review but on a slow Saturday afternoon after the lunch time rush is inexcusable.  You might want to brief your servers that good service equals good tips. You really have to not try to get a 10% tip from us she succeed here.. She could have easily gotten 20% had she put some effort into it .  With that said, the food was excellent, and hot and fresh. The steak was cooked perfect. Would have been much better though with some salt and pepper. I think we will try the one on Stapley next time as both places are the same distance from our house.",

Anyway, tonight (5/21) we were about an hour away from home but near this Mellow Mushroom so I thought it'd be great to get something to go since we don't have one by us. I called to place the order and the girl who answered the phone was completely rude and not only that, they refused to make my calzone. I have ALWAYS ordered a calzone with sauce and pepperoni inside it and no cheese. It's not a ton of sauce but there's a little bit. Well, she flat out refused to ring it up saying that they can't make it with sauce in it. She claimed to have asked someone to verify but I was barely on hold for 5 seconds so I think she was just pretending. Super rude and this location will never get our $$!  I've ordered it that way from two other AZ locations with no issues so why couldn't they do it? I will NEVER go back to that location and advise others not to visit them as well. Luckily, the Tempe location was kind of on our way home as well and they made it with no hesitation.",

The bar has indoor / outdoor seating (hallelujah, we are finally in \"sit outside\" weather again), a bazillion beers on tap, fantastic bartenders and happy hour during the week.   The pizzas are on the high end of the pizza pricing spectrum but they're worth it. Mellow's crust is unique and delicious. Try the Magical Mystery Tour or the Philosopher's Pie. Or just get an appetizer or a Chopped Salad - those are good, too.",

What loses the one star is the price of O'Douls. $5.50 really? That's more expensive than real beer! When I stopped drinking a couple years ago you guys charged 1.99. Now I have to pay more because I'm making a smart decision? At least offer a cheaper N/A alternative. Not thrilled.",

The fun eclectic atmosphere pairs well with the perfectly done crust of the pizza. Although it was a plain cheese pie--I knew you were special.   When I found you in Charlotte, NC, I began to really appreciate the depth and breathe of your menu. I'd order your pretzels for a giggle and be taken by the dipping sauces you include.   I've become an avid adventurer though the different varieties of pizza on the menu--the Hail Caesar and Magical Mystery Tour top my list.   Please continue to expand your reach!  Take a chance and venture into NYC! Please!",

Sad to say, two of the three times I have been to this restaurant I've been very disappointed. The first time I ordered the Hawaii pizza (I don't remember it's named on the menu) and I kid you not each slice of pizza had two, TWO tiny pieces of pineapple, maybe three pieces of ham and no cheese. It was basically just bread. I wish I had a picture because it would be impossible for anyone with eyes to look at that pizza and say that it was made properly.   Took me a long time to go back. But I finally did and I got the holy shiitake mushroom pizza. It was AMAZING. Lots of mushrooms and the sauce is phenomenal. So I went back again and got the same thing. IT WAS TERRIBLE. again, only two tiny slices of mushroom on each slice. It was basically cheese bread.   I don't know what is going on with their pizza guy. But I think that is totally unacceptable for this to happen for the prices they charge. I will forever love Mellow Mushroom. But this location has lost my business.  Also side note: each time I got take out. Therefore could not send it back. But if I was sitting down at the restaurant I would of for sure sent that bad boy back.",

We did not enjoy our pizzas - they were under cooked, soggy, and the toppings were low quality.  Totally not worth the money!  Two stars for good service and a nice beer selection.",

Their spinach artichoke dip is also the best I've ever tasted which says a lot coming from the typical mediocre bar food you'd get at places like this. Also their Thai dye pizza is delicious as well. We go here at least once a week when we can make the happy hour :)",

I normally only get thin crust pizzas because I don't like all that breading but their crust was really good. It has a buttery sweetness but with a wonderful crispy texture. Mmm! Next time I really want to try one of their salads too. For me, pizza and salad are the perfect couple. We'll definitely be coming back here again.",

Definitely recommend the pizza and all the appitizers are delicious especially their cheese sauce fot the pretzels (that you want to dip EVERYTHING in)! All speciality drinks  are half off! Not just well drinks and the crappy stuff. 2 thumbs up for me!",

I am certainly confused about the theatre atmosphere...",

Rarely do I get what I would consider standard service and trust me when I say my expectations are not that high.   This mellow mushroom exceeded our  expectations, specifically a server named Tamara.  This girl was constantly checking in on is to ensure our drinks were always filled and we were ok.  I can't even recall a time in the past that I was treated like this.   It was refreshing to actually be waited on knowing you don't have to go flag your server down.  She is setting the standard and the service at this mellow mushroom (because we've been to a couple)  should be an example to other mellow mushrooms.",

Way too much sauce, I couldn't even pick it up to eat it. We also got the pretzels but they tasted more like the pizza crust.  Every thing is over priced, even their drinks...I got a got a glass of wine which by the way was under poured. If you don't mind paying over $20 for a pizza then this is your place.",

    "text": "We went to Mellow Mushroom on a Sunday evening. The place was fairly busy, but not completely packed. The atmosphere is rather nice and there is a movie theme that the whole place is done up in.  Our server told us that pizza takes about 25 minutes to bake, and apparently salads take just as long. Our service was not ideal- no refills, never asked if everything worked out. It was a very minimal service on our server's part.  The salad, imo, is rather overpriced. I did an a la carte/build your own style- and a dollar's worth of tomato equates to four slices. 2 dollars of cheese is about a teaspoon of cheddar, and 2.50 worth of turkey is about like.. two slices of lunch meat crumbled up in the corner.  Mind you, the quality of the salad ingredients wasn't bad- but hte portion was not equivalent to price paid. Plus, the thousand island tastes like you took a bite of Miracle Whip and called it dressing. My companion's salad was about hte same- very minimal on the toppings and their dressing tasted like lemon juice and garlic.   All in all, I don't think I'll be returning. The price of the food mixed with the low quality service doesn't make me inclined to come back.",

    "text": "Tried this place out for the first time last night with a party of four adults and 3 children under 12.  Atmosphere was relaxed and casual, but everything was immaculately clean and the booth we were in was both large enough, and comfortable enough for all of us.  The service was Excellent!!  Our waiter, Patrick, was friendly, helpful and very attentive.  The rest of the wait staff I observed seemed to be equally outstanding.  We started off with an order of their pretzel appetizers, which were soft and chewy, just like giant pretzels should be.  They could have had a little more salt on them, but there was enough.    Then we ordered the House Special.  It was very good pizza, great flavor, and plenty of toppings.  Unfortunately, it took way too long to bring out (20 minutes, maybe 25), and the rim of crust was much too wide.  The wait I'll attribute to the fact that this is a newer restaurant, and it takes a while to get the kinks out of the kitchen process.  To give credit where due, this is when Patrick really stepped up, and made sure that we were comfortable while we waited.     Also, to Patrick's immense credit, he put the kid's meals orders in as appetizers, so their food came out very quickly, and while the adults waited, they were fed and happy.  So, I'd give this place a 3.5 on the food, but a solid 5 on service.    More importantly, I'd gladly go back the next time I'm in the area and hungry.",
