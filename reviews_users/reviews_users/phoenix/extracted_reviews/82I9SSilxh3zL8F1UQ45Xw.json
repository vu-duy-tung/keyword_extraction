I enjoy a nice basic sport's bar on occasion since we cut our cable and basically only catch games or fights while out now. My food was average for sports bars both times (the grilled cheese with tomato soup once, and a bowl of tortilla soup another), but my parmesan cheese fries were huge and delicious and my SO liked his BBQ burger so much he got it twice. I really like their beer and their service was fantastic.",

Like it or not, this place is a bit of a dive bar, in a complimentary way, so the prices should follow along with that. You don't come to a place with peanut shells all over the place expecting class and sophistication, so I'd rather not pay those sort of prices either.",

    "text": "Walked in here as a change of pace from Pita Jungle next door. Very open and spacious. Huge garage door type of opening behind the first bar lets lots of sunshine and fresh air in.   Jen ordered the beer flight and was a big fan. I'm not a big drinker but the Head to Tale Amber Ale was pretty good for my novice palette.    We had the chicken fingers as an app and even though normally I don't like breaded, theses had a subtle peppery seasoning in the breading which made me want to come back here again just for that and the distinctively different BBQ sauce that came on the side.  Jen and I both ordered prime rib. Didn't know what we wanted at first but it coincidentally was 4pm when they started serving it. Great choice. Jen knows i ca be pretty critical of my food, and when she asked me how it was I said, \"Best prime rib I've had in 20 years.\"  No joke. It could have been that we probably had the first slice and it was also a little luck since our server didn't ask what temp we wanted and yet it came out a perfect medium rare and was sooooooooo good.   Our server was pretty much MIA the majority of the time. Alright guy and other server did check on us. We could have used a little more attention but the meal was so good I pretty much overlooked that part.   On a side note for those who might like to know, the patio is dog friendly and they have a ton of TVs.    I've also read some reviews about not being greeted promptly and poor service. To be honest I can see this just from observing by our experience wasn't all that bad and the food was so damn good we will definitely be back.",

I feel that the staff genuinely want to be there and want to provide the best possible service so that each guest enjoys his or her visit. I've had burgers on each of my visits and have substituted veggie patties each time; the veggie patties are nicely seasoned and have good texture. I particularly like the sweet potato fries: crisp on the outside, steaming hot on the inside. My husband is a self-proclaimed beer snob and said that tonight's stout was  one of Uncle Bear's best beers. (Said stout is a seasonal selection, though.)   Uncle Bear's loves their canine companions and guests can see oodles of framed photos of lovable pooches along the entry and bathroom hallways. I'm not certain if Uncle Bear's allows dogs inside, but I have seen a dog or two accompany his or her human on the patio.  :)",

I am excited for the double IPA sour to make it's return.   So far I haven't ordered anything I don't like.  The prime rib sliders are ridiculous, which makes it tough to order anything else.  My wife loves the wings grilled and retossed.  The pb & j burger is incredible as well, and goes great with the peanut butter cup Porter.   My kids are treated very well by all the staff.  My youngest loves to sit at the dog bone outside and have the fire turned on, which they never hesitate to do for him.  I will continue to frequent this amazing establishment almost every Saturday.

I explained that I am from Portland (where IPAs reign supreme) and that the beer they are calling an IPA tastes like no IPA I have ever had. The bartender dug his heels in and did not offer another selection. I settled my tab and left. I went to Tukee's to get a proper IPA (Racer) and sat by a former employee who told me that they had changed brewers and their IPA recipe as well. He agreed that what they are putting forth as IPA is a joke and is but one reason why they are doing so poorly. Sad because I really wanted this location to work out.",

I got the prime rib sliders but they lacked any flavor development and sides were all about average. However, I think risking another visit to try a different item on the menu is worth it just to have their wings again.",

Best for last:  The Cheddar Ale soup is totally bonkers!  I've never had anything like it.  Service was attentive, helpful with the menu and beer selection, and pretty quick.   The place has a sports-bar atmosphere with a zillion TV's and a rambunctious crowd, but nothing I'd be afraid to bring the children to.",

My food order got lost after a lengthy wait I asked what was going on only to learn of the error. The bartenders stepped up and provided me with a comp to help the situation which was very much appreciated. It's nice to see places take ownership for their mistakes and not just leave the customer to absorb it.  I had the bbq pork sliders which were great. I found the food prices to be $2-3 more than surrounding sports bars for basic apps and burgers. Their other items were more priced like you were in a restaurant for but getting bar food. As such if you're looking for value you might not find it here, I didn't notice any specials either. One thing that does stand out is their homemade beers, they've got the market cornered in this area for sure. They also have an outdoor patio area and open window bar area which is good when the temps are nice outside.  I'll be back when I'm in the mood for a crafted beer. But for value CK's and Native I find to be better.",

It happened again, we are at a brewery and they are out of three of the drafts listed that we asked for!  We were so disappointed and wanted to leave but reluctantly ordered the Mandarin Wheat Beer since they actually had it, and then we knew why; it was just awful, a few sips and we were done!  The wings were good and the server was just OK, not enough waiters.  Last time we went was about six months ago on a Friday and we were seated on the patio, which was fine.  Evidently we were invisible because we sat for 20 minutes and were never spoken to, no menus, no water, nothing!  All I can say is lesson learned, we will never go again.  We support our local businesses and unless they seriously change their ways and hire good help that are trained they will be closing their doors!",

Uncle Bear's was the PERFECT solution. We sat at the outside bar which had plenty of room and 3 TVs to catch the games on. If you're not a bar person, there were plenty of high top and low top outdoor tables as well. Our bartender, Derek was great with recommendations and was fun to hang out with for the time that we were there.   It took me FOREVER to order my food because everything on the menu looked so good. I ended up getting the grilled cheese which was amazing. I thought it would be too overboard with the menu description, but I just had to try it anyways. Much to my surprise it wasn't too much, it was just right and perfectly balanced with the bacon and basil. I can't speak to the bisque because that's not my thing and I didn't try it, but I'm sure if you're into that combo it only escalates the experience. My boyfriend got the sliders which he loved! We were surprised by the portion size... 4 sliders instead of the normal 3 you get other places. He raved about the hawaiian role like buns they came on. Also beer battered fries... need I say more.  TLDR: Excellent food. Great Beer. Awesome Service. 5 star Patio. Perfect for dogs.",

    "text": "Uncle Bears has a nice selection of unique brewed on premises beer options.  Many are quite good. It's fun to come here and explore the seasonal offerings. Food is good. Well prepared and plated.  The value is acceptable for the serving size, quality and taste. While not a national chain and with only a few local locations, Uncle Bears is a highly polished operation.  I like to linger, enjoy some libations and eventually order. Our waitperson, Levi, identified that allowing us the space to enjoy our visit while also checking in frequently. Bravo for that level of service.   Additionally, Uncle Bears gives back to the community.  So give back and check them out.",

The ambiance is very comfortable, they have a back area that's heated by little fires on the table and the drinks were well done. They craft their own beer and offer samples for those who want to taste before hand. This place is also dog friendly in case you want to bring Fido along with you. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good craft beer (didn't eat there, so not sure).",

Eventually a different server came over and said that someone made a mistake with one of the sandwiches and that's why the food took so long. (Why everyone at our table had to wait over one sandwich, I don't know). Once the food came out it was pretty bad. The buns on the sliders were hard, the fries were cold and soggy, my pizza was missing ingredients. I got the Hunters which called for arugula and balsamic which it had neither. Prob won't be coming back any time soon if at all. Just overall weird bad service this time around.",

I love the look of the brewery and restaurant, they did a great job! The visit started out well, we were greeted and seated and saw our waiter quickly. After that, it just got worse and worse. It took forever before our waiter came and took our food order and it took longer and longer to see him each time. He seemed to forget about my husband's first beer and by the time he had remembered, the head on the beer had completely gone down and we saw him over at the bar take a straw and stir it up to make it look like it was freshly poured. The food also took over 40 minutes to come out, not sure if that was the kitchen or waiter's fault. The food was very good though as is their beer. We will definitely give this place another shot and hopefully get better service!",

They tasted good but I prefer traditional hot wings. Honey hot was tasty, but again the grilled style kind of made them burned. I had the HERDs brisket burger and it sounds good on paper with all the ingredients, but they didn't work well enough together. The biggest knock against this place has to be that the menus, tables and even salt and pepper shakers were sticky and dirty.  Overall, the food was ok, not overly delicious but decent. The service was pretty good, especially since the server didn't get the reaction she was hoping for on the wings and took them off the bill since she suggested it. Which was a very classy move.   Queso and chips were good. I would give it another chance but wouldn't highly recommend   Elisa was very nice though!",

Honestly, their beers didn't blow our mind, the seasonal Pale Ale was surprisingly bitter and the Golden Ale was a bit bland. However, I really liked the Dark Ale and Hefe.

We came in at 4:30 on a Friday, well before the evening rush and were seated immediately and that's where the positives end. The music was so loud we could not even have a normal conversation. Our server was...probably the best description is \"ambivalent\" after he found out we weren't ordering alcohol. Two other parties that were seated after us, who ordered lots of alcohol, had orders taken and served quickly. We got our appetizer but we're almost finished before he took our order. What's worse is our server had obviously been drinking, he had horrible alcohol breath and body odor. We should have just walked out but we had already ordered. I had to ask for a re-fill and my wife's never came. The food was good, basic bar & grill food. Our bill came to $29 and even though I didn't want to tip anything, I left a $4 tip and wrote a note on the bill \"Sorry, but the service was just not good tonight\". We will not be back to this location and hope the Chandler location fairs better.",

Once we were sat, we waited 10 min before our waiter greeted us, although we did see him walk past the table (without acknowledging us), many times. We ordered drinks, which sat at the bar 10 min before being delivered. There were multiple other patrons that appeared equally as annoyed with his lack of urgency in all his tasks. It was as though he had no ability to multitask or even acknowledge that people were clearly waiting on him. Although he was incredibly slow and unaware, what was most annoying, is that he sat down, in the table behind us, to eat his dinner. He had at least 2-3 tables, and he was sitting eating dinner ? I was a server for many years throughout college - I would've been written up in a second if I sat and ate in front of my customers. My husband actually had to interrupt our servers meal to ask for a side item.  It was so incredibly flippant - for a table of 5-6 servers to sit in the booth behind us and eat, while tables were waiting for service. It was extremely disappointing. I tried to email the manager to notify him - they didn't respond",

We also tried the \"sangria\" let me just save you $7.50, it's grape juice in a wine glass with an ice cube! I checked the time when we ordered the food and when we actually received it and it took 43 mins. We were looking at 4 plates under the light at the food station for 10 mins, all the servers were walking checking the food and didn't take them, and than our server realized that it was HIS TABLE.

Though a great place to hang, the food we had, and the drinks, were sub-par. The majority of the beer tasted the same to me, and no one was impressed with their entrees. The appetizers were standard bar food. Set your expectations for a good atmosphere and ok food, and you're set! Service was fantastic, also, which helped.",

They had 13 of their own as well as a selection of other beers. We had an order of garlic Parmesan fries to go with our beers.  I tried their peanut butter porter, which was to die for! The side of fries was a large serving considering we ordered the side instead of a full basket. It was more than enough for two to eat as a appetizer. They were excellent! I glanced at the menu and it had a good selection of burgers, tacos, and other bar-style food.   The restaurant itself was nice. There were tvs everywhere and it was Sunday afternoon so they had football on all the tvs. Behind the bar were garage doors which were open to a large fenced in patio with a fireplace.  Overall it was a good experience for a little side trip and I look forward to going back for a full meal, or maybe another post-workout treat!",

But, it did not.   While the wings were good and meaty, everything else feel way short.  The sloppy Joe was the consistency of wet dog food and did not taste good.  The Mac n cheese was flavor less ( it's bad when a 4 year old is asking for salt and pepper ).  The fries were battered and greasy.  The chicken tenders and the queso dip were decent though.  The wait staff was excellent; however,  this review is for the food alone.  Step up the quality of the food to match the high prices, and this place would be decent.  Good beer selection.",

    "text": "It pays to know a local. We came here at the suggestion of my cousin, who lives in the area. We arranged to meet here after a text exchnage.  The beer was fine. I had the flight, which allowed me to taste several of them. My favorite was the Hop Dog, a double IPA. Other reviews mention that the beer is not as cold as it could or should be. Good point Yelpers....  The food was fine as well. Our group of four, had Mango-Hot wings, poppers and garlic-parm fries as appetizers. I thought the wings were not very meaty and the sauce just tasted OK. The poppers were fine. The garlic-parm fries had enough garlic to make you vampire-proof. My wife had the basic burger but changed her side to the side salad. Later, she was talking about wanting to go back for that salad, so I guess it was good. I had the Herd's burger, which from their menu and website, looks like it has it's roots in some Texas burger joint. I asked for medium, but the burger is subjected to some special meat-chopping-griddle-cooking process they said it can only be prepared well done. OK.. fine. The burger was decent. There was something spicy. Not sure if it was the mustard or the pepper-jack cheese I asked for. I upgraded to onion rings. That cost another $1.50.  We had a really good server named Aaron who took excellent care of us and even shook our hands when we left. The dog themed ambiance is kinda cool and the food and beer are fine. I know that's not exactly a glowing endorsement, but service like that gets them an extra star and a half.",

Also, my friend ordered double tossed wings (which you pay extra for) and I swear they didn't toss them again after grilling them. They were really dry and he ended up asking for sauce on the side. If that is how they are supposed to be, I wouldn't recommend paying the extra $ for them.",

    "text": "I visited this place for the first time with my husband last weekend and was surprised to find that they brew their own beer. I was pretty excited about that and so I ordered the sampler to try them all and she even gave me a small shot of the stout which was not included in the sampler. Most of the beers had pretty good flavor but not enough of it. They were just a little too thin and tasted watered down. Some I liked more than others but really they all were lacking in body. The food is basic bar food: burgers, pizza, a bunch of fried appetizers. Their wings were pretty tasty but everything else was just ok. I don't think the burgers and fries are fresh made in house. I probably would not come here again for the food since it was a pretty boring menu but I might stop in for a pint before watching a movie at the AMC next door. So, here are my thoughts on their beers:  Dog Paddle Wheat - It may just have been the power of suggestion since I read the description before tasting but I really did get the notes of coriander in the flavor. This is a nice and light summer beer but I really didn't get a wheat flavor or mouthfeel at all like you would in a hefe. I'd try this one again when it's hot out and probably like it a lot better. I think it would go great with some Mexican food.  Fence Jumper - Description says oats were involved but apparently not enough to release any proteins because again it seemed watered down. Flavor was very bland as well but then I'm just not a light beer type of girl. Order this one if you are used to Budweiser. You'll probably like it.  Head to Tail Amber - Well usually amber is my favorite but again there was a lack of flavor and body. I will say that it was a really good balance between the malt and the hops. Not a bad beer just a little too dry for me. Hubby had ordered an Angry Orchard and we did try mixing the two (they offer this as an option on their menu) and we both agreed that was very good!  Dog Park Dark Ale - This is a great beer. Really well done. Excellent flavor. I love the deep malty beers though so this is just right up my alley. Again, light body but that's ok because it means you can drink more without filling up! If you like the taste of Guinness but not the heaviness give this a try.  Ocean Beach West Coast IPA - I don't really drink IPAs but this one was ok. Not too hoppy so I guess that's why they classified it as west coast. I did get the citrus taste mentioned in the description so I bet this one would be good in the summer, too.  Dog's Out Stout - I always love a good stout and this one was no exception. Not too much sweetness there - it was a little dry but still great depth of flavor. Again the body was lacking which was a disappointments since usually stouts have a nice creamy mouthfeel to them.  I ordered a pint of the dark ale and confirmed that this is the best beer of the bunch (to my palate at least). I wouldn't mind drinking any of them again but I wouldn't necessarily seek them out either. I hope they keep working on improving the recipes because at least they are on the right track.",

My dressing for the salad was basically sweet Thai chilly sauce you get at Trader Joe's. Yes, that was my dressing. The texture of the sauce is not meant to be on a salad. The chicken was rock hard. The chicken was basically covered in batter. The Parmesan fries were soggy. My wings I paid extra for it to be grilled didn't look it was grilled at all. The flavor I got on the wings-garlic parmesan, there was no flavor of that sort on my wings. Our other friend ordered a mildly hot chicken pizza, she said their hot sauce basically covered the whole pizza. It was gross. Our friends had similar complaints as we all basically had the same thing. Our waitress was very nice. It's not her fault the food was not very good.",

    "text": "I had Uncle Bear's on my radar for a couple years and finally made a trip after a hike on nearby South Mountain. I had heard of the famed peanut butter cup Porter and of course had to have a taste of that (and others too)! I ordered a flight which comes with 5 4-oz pours, my selection including the Beach Bum Tropical IPA, Holiday Hound Winter Ale, Peanut Butter Cup Porter, See Me Rollin' Cinnamon Roll Brown Ale, and their nitro stout (forgot its name). While a lot of the beers were par to slightly better (the peanut butter cup porter wasn't as good as I had anticipated), the cinnamon brown ale was absolutely fantastic! The cinnamon notes really complemented the malt character and it was total heaven in my mouth. The tropical IPA was also pretty good, reminiscent of some of the IPAs I used to drink living close to SD.  So what makes this place a 4-star joint instead of an average 3? Good service and their willingness to go unconventional, think outside the box. My friend ordered their PBJ Burger and thoroughly enjoyed it. Taking that kind of bold risk to put a unique food item on your menu earns some kudos in my book. Keep it up, UB's! Might make it back before the season's end for more of that cinnamon ale!",

The patty itself was crumbly with every bite, but I rather like that texture as I pick up the small pieces and stuffed it in my mouth!  You're not getting away food!  Overall, my visit was fun!  The service was real good and on top of things.  What weird me out was the dog pictures on my menu.  I know the theme of the restaurant was dogs and don't get me wrong I love them!

Party of 13. Servers accommodated our needs, put tables together for our large party. They were \"on top of it\"... Not a long wait! We had two servers that were outstanding!! Food was great. Onion rings are soooo good!  Grilled Cheese was enjoyed by one of our patrons as well as the MAC n Cheese! Comfort Food at its best!  Burgers are fantastic! Only negative NO fresh eggs??! My hubby LOVES the BBQ Big Dog Burger with an \"over easy\" egg on top! All they had were hard boiled..:( We will be back again. Keep up the great customer service & good food!",

If you're looking for a spot to sit on the patio with your dogs, sip a beer or three, watch tv while eating good food, then Uncle Bears is the place for you.    They're making their own beers and have a huge selection to choose from.  They also have a big menu for those undecided on what to get.  I highly recommend the queso and chips and the baked pretzel for apps and their half and half combo for lunch which is soup or salad served with wings, a sandwich or pizza.    The side salad was ridiculous.  It was like an entree salad, fresh and delicious.  I paired it with a taster of the peanut butter porter then their bulldog peach tea drink which had sweet tea vodka, peach schnapps, lemonade and a lemon wedge.     The manager came around to the tables outside to make sure the pups had ample ice water which I truly appreciate.  They opened their doors to us two legged humans and our fur babies.",

The seasonal Pale Ale came a little on the bitter side but was definitely my favorite. My boyfriend enjoyed the Dark Ale with just a hint of chocolate/ espresso taste.

I ordered the basic burger with no onion, tomatoes or mustard, only lettuce and ketchup.  I also ordered onion rings in place of fries.  My burger came with onions, tomatoes and mustard - no lettuce or ketchup - with fries on the side.  I told the waiter and he apologized and promised to fix the error.  My second burger came with nothing but the patty and mustard - no lettuce or ketchup.  By this time, they had brought my onion rings so I could eat something during the burger catastrophe.  The third burger attempt produced just a patty - no lettuce or ketchup.  I asked the waiter to get those items for me and he brought those on the side.  He apologized and murmured something about the new burger process, blah, blah, blah.  My husband ordered the mac and cheese with shrimp which he enjoyed.  I figured the restaurant would comp our drinks or my burger, but nada.  I was extremely disappointed.",

I almost always order the chili which is awesome. The chili and wings are an inexpensive meal with your choice of beer, golden. Can't go wrong with the burgers, I always ask to hold the bun. My biggest issue and the only reason why I dinged them to two stars was the service. Typically, I've had good service. Never been great but good enough. Tonight we had a young lady (don't remember her name but she had tattoos across her collarbone), she was friendly too but she was super slow. It took forever to get my wings and chili and it wasn't busy! She forgot my father's cocktail order. It was bad.  I'll come back but not for the service and with lower expectations.",

I like mine super saucy and these lacked sauce. Another problem I ran into is I got half garlic Parmesan as recommendation from our server. Bad decision. I'm sure they would have been good to a person that isn't obsessed with sauciness. I am giving 4 stars since my boyfriend loved their wings though. He likes them not too saucy and crispy, and they came out just like that. If you're into sauciness, maybe tell your server to not skimp on the sauce? Lol I'm sure it is not a problem to fix. Also, another cool thing about this place: they are dog friendly from what I remember! Bring your well behaved pup to the patio!",

I'm not saying the beer is better; there are some fine tuning and tweaking to recipes that need to occur. It is still damn tasty brewage though! From a front of the house perspective, UB's delivers.  The bar itself has a great set up. Changing lights, some TV's...it's right on par with what you'd expect. It is very clean and modern. No grungy craft bar feel to it. If you didn't see the brewing equipment in the back, you probably wouldn't even know the brew their own shit.   Food is great as well. Try any of the sliders, they're all outstanding. Wings are very good as well. Service is ideal. There when you did them, not all up in your grill every 5 minutes asking, \"Is everything okay?\" Just the right amount.  Food? Excellent. Beer? Excellent. Service? Excellent. Stop on by, but not on Friday. It's already packed enough and I don't want you taking my seat.",

I've always been fond of the chicken ceasar salad, good stuff! They have microbrews, with seasonals on rotation.Their in-house IPA is great, I go for it every time. Bears now offers growlers to take their brew home with you!  It's $5 to buy the growler and then $12 each fill.

Just wanted to get that out of the way before I start this thing! Wife and I was in Tempe to see our Daughter and boyfriend. Brought our little princess with us, daughter said there was an Uncle Bear's nearby! Now Uncle Bear's in well known pet friendly establishment, always a great place for your pooch. Now of course this was on a Saturday night, all of you kids have nothing to do except taking up space! (saying this with a grin) So we had to wait for a table outside, now what I did not like was instead of using the usual led vibrator to let you know your table is ready. They ask for your cell phone so they can text you! That's one way of saving money I guess.  Now to the food and service. When we finally got seated, we were told since we were on the patio our service was going to be slower? So I asked him why are we second class compare to the dining room! He immediately changed his wording to since there are a lot of people here our service is behind. Since he realized I wasn't going take any crap from him, our service was pretty quick. ;-)  The menu was OK a lot different from Uncle Bear's Bar and Grill, I was in the mood for a Crispy Chicken Salad. But they did not offer that there, I also wanted the Jalapeno Poppers appetizer. They again did not offer that there! That's when I realized I had to look at their menu. So I ended up ordering their soft pretzel with cheese and sauce. This was a good thing, pretzel was baked with a butter topping. This was probably the best thing I ate that night. I ordered their slow cooked ribs, I was assuming they were going to be more like a BBQ style ribs. Oops! it was more like a pot roast style. I had their veggie's and mashed potato's with my meal. Overall the good was good, not what I was expecting. Service was OK, and the food was OK. There is a reason why I live in Surprise, to get away from this crowd!",

He gave me a 4oz sample on the house after I already purchased a drink and growler.  After some time he handed me my growler and he explained, \" just a heads up, it's good to have some head for the carbonation.\"  Pretty sure that it's better to have less oxygen in the growler so it lasts longer. Very disappointed, as I brag about this place.  Going to fill my growlers elsewhere now.",

To be fair though, their BLT is delicious. I ate Texas butt and I cannot lie. It would be nice if the butt was bigger though; then maybe I wouldn't mind eating the butt.",

The bbq sauce was heavy and somewhat sweet - it also overwhelmed the taste of the meat as well as the coleslaw and onion strips that were part of the sandwich.  The sweet potato fries were okay but bland.  The service was good and the booth was comfortable.  They have about 10 different TVs tuned to various sports channels.  The music volume was average for a sports bar.  I probably would not go back simply because the food was very underwhelming.  Bland chain-restaurant quality.  However, they have a much bigger emphasis on burgers than the bbq so perhaps those are better?",

I know that they are trying to shy away from being known as a sports bar and are trying to be more well known for brewing, but I really don't think their beer is top quality yet.  I did appreciate the farmhouse saison though because a lot of breweries don't even attempt those.  We like Uncle Bear's for the great Happy Hour and daily specials.  Every seat at the bar is perfect for watching the game.  We love the tostada nachos and the sliders.",

We seated ourselves in the bar area and were greeted about 4 mins later. After reviewing the menu i decided on chips and salsa for an appetizer and the prime rib sliders. After about 20 mins we got out food... however, i was expecting our chips and salsa to come out first. It was, after all, an appetizer in which required no cooking or prepping. When i asked where the chips and salsa were, the waitress acted surprised that we did not get them, apologized, and went to get the order. At this point it was kind of pointless since we already had our food.   The prim rib sliders were somewhat dry. Thank goodness for the juice they provided on the side. Needless to say, I wont be getting them again. The one thing i can say is the portion's are decent for a lunch menu item.   I'm not sure if i will be coming back here or not. I'm all for giving a restaurant a second chance, however, with the combination of service provided, forgetting the chips and salsa, and the quality of the food...this will not be my first choice.",

Her name was Courtney, so just make sure the next time you come in you ask for two drinks in advance cause your only going to see her once your whole time there. Also it was obvious that the place was laid back with service, from our table you could see into the kitchen, I literally saw the guy cooks playing with each other. The waitresses in their service room were grouped in three leaning back as if there wasn't anything to do out on the floor. The only nice thing about it was the hostess who brought us to the table, although it seemed like nobody knew we were even there, as if we were stumbled upon.  Definitely will not recommend this place, and I love recommending places in Arizona. Ugh. I should of just went to Pita Jungle.",

We got the scorpion sauce and it was excellent! Perhaps there a little small but it was $4 for half a dozen. They were cooked just right and our taste buds were definitely feelin it. If you're into spicy like I am, order the scorpion sauce with your wings! Will be coming back for more.   I just love the location, the people, and the vibe. The beer choices were excellent! I can't wait to see what kind of beers they'll be brewin in the future! Happy hour is just great! The price is just right!",

Kitchen closes at 10 during the week. Love the indoor/outdoor ambience. Good location to watch sports. All the beers are brewed in house and the bartender recommended a Uncle Bears West Coast style IPA. I'm a hop head from CA, so hard to find good West coast style that I am accustomed to around here, they usually have to much malt. This one was pretty good at 6.9% with 60 ibu's. I highly recommend it.",

Guacamole could use a little bit more lemon juice & tasted a bit watered down. Salsa was ok-very peppery. I went with the Prime Rib Philly w/fries. Surprisingly it was delicious!! Very tender, juicy & seasoned well-although a side of horseradish would have been nice. Not bad for my first time there, although the tables in the bar area could have been a bit cleaner...food crumbs. I am willing to return for the beer & sampling of other foods.",

Would give a 2.5 stars if I could.  Decor & Ambiance. Very clean, good atmosphere, and nicely decorated - especially if you are a dog lover - and the music was not too loud. Garage doors allowed the place to be ventilated which is nice this time of year.   Food. Pepperoni and ham pizza: crust could have been a tad crispier, and the sauce was slightly sweet. Beer cheese soup: was more like queso, and needed more flavor from a good stock. Sizzling beef fajita salad: good mixture of greens, but the beef had a slight chili powder flavor, a couple of sprigs of cilantro, some jalapenos, a line wedge for the beef, and a few tortilla strips would have helped a lot - as would have another dressing and the beef not been cooked so much.  Service. Hostesses were very friendly, as was the entire staff. Our waiter however was not quite up to speed as he failed to ask: what side dish we wanted, whether the soup should have been served first rather than as side (yes), type of salad dressing, and degree of doneness for the beef fajitas. Then he failed to catch an overcharge on the bill.   All-in-all, a good place for a beer, but better pub food to be had elsewhere.",

The mash tuns and kettles are right behind me, not currently a lot of activity, but the six beers on tap are all tasty!  The bar food (dogs and brats) are good as well, with a lot of variety in toppings. The seasoned fries are crispy but not too much so. The music is awful, I don't even recognize the decade, but it's not memorable... According to helpful waitstaff, there are about 5 Muzak channels they're allowed to pick, but this one is pretty weak. The bar is open to the patio, I chose to sit inside since it's impossible to see the TV screens when outside. Good place and worth a visit!",

    "text": "The only reason there are two stars above is for the beer and my husband's Cajun Chicken sandwich which he said was good. Ok, so my husband and I went to Bear's this evening and my meal was truly unfortunate. I ordered the Sizzling Fajita Salad. To be blunt the lettuce was limp, the cheese tasted weird, the chicken was salty, the ranch dressing was watery, and the beef was bland. On top of this to have sour cream and guacamole on the side was an extra $2.75.  I take responsibility for eating most of the salad (I was hungry and was thankfully able to eat some of my husband's fries) but did not enjoy the meal despite really trying to. (How many salad dressing combos can a person create with salsa, ranch, and sour cream?!) I expressed this to the waitress (who was very good and not a part of this negative review) at the end of the meal. She thanked me for my feedback, which I appreciated, and took the situation to the manager. The manager ended up taking $2.10. $2.10 off a $50 meal. That's doesn't even cover the tax. That actually didn't even cover the extra I paid for an attempt at flavor by adding guacamole and sour cream. My husband and I are in agreement that except for an occasional beer or chicken wing there and many other places that actually provide a satisfying beer and a good meal.",

Turns out, it does seem to have gone downhill.  I have not written a review in many years, but I felt the need to after my experience here.  I walked up with my dog and saw the sign on the patio said to please see the host/hostess for seating so I went inside and she said we could find a place to sit on the patio. Great, so I did just that. They had a decent patio and it was not too crowded but there were about 4-5 other dogs with their owners out there. Over 15 minutes went by and no one had come over to give me a menu or ask if I wanted anything.  At about the 20 minute mark, someone finally came over to the table next to me and apologized for it taking so long and said she would get menus. A few minutes later, she came over and said the same to me. She asked if I wanted a drink and I said I had not seen a menu yet. She said she would go get me a menu and a water. OK, that should be good right? Not quite...a guy comes out and hands me the water and says they did not realize I was sitting out here...even though the hostess told me to. He asked if I wanted a drink and I again said I had not even seen a menu yet. He walked off and said \"maybe you should have checked in with the hostess first then.\" OK, I am done with you. I said \"nevermind, bye\" and took my dog and left. Horrible service, and even worse customer service. One star for having water for dogs already outside.",

I used to work in the area and had many business lunches here about 3-4 years ago, and my husband and I have been here several times after movies at the attached AMC theater.    On our most recent visit I tried the head to tale amber ale ($6) and my Mr. tried the cigar-themed brew ($6).  Both were tasty and the cigar beer had a nice depth of flavor.  That one would be perfect to savor along with a nice smoke.  For my food I had the prime rib Philly with sweet potato fries ($15.65) and he had the Egg Style Herds burger which comes with cheese, bacon, egg, and avocado, and onion rings ($13.65).  My Philly was good, but that burger was excellent.  We went halvsies, but I'm definitely getting that burger all to myself next time.  What a great combination.    Uncle Bear's has always provided friendly, fast service, even for the business lunches I've had here where sometimes there would be 12-15 people in attendance, and the food and beer is excellent as well.  Another beer worth a mention is the peanut butter cup porter.  Nicely done.  Solid place all around.",

Service was not quick considering the place was mostly empty. 7 out of 10.  Atmosphere is fair. Strangely laid out, kegs stacked around everywhere and pallets of containers stacked in a main walkway. Smelled a bit like a \"working\" factory, but not in the good microbrew way. Bathrooms pretty dirty, not terrible. Very open restaurant, but not comfortable feeling. Seems strangely laid out with random tv's strewn around. Atmosphere is 5 of 10.  Food was fair. Was unremarkable (we had appetizers) and tasted like mediocre bar food from other mediocre bars. The beer was actually bad. I tasted 5 to pick my favorite. They all had a skunky aftertaste like most home brewers get in their first few years brewing. None were above average, all were below. I give the food and beer a 3.5 out of 10.  The only saving grace for this place is the pictures of cute dogs on the walls and canine theme.  Overall, I would not return to Uncle Bears. I give it a 4.5 out of 10.",

Tukies on chandler, has a much better vibe although does not brew its own beer. Service was meh. Was not asked if the table offered was decent and when we asked for another table waiting 10 minutes to clean was not good. Table was wiped down with same cloth that was wiped on seats.... honestly seriously gross. Will not be back. Y'all are trying the college thing in the wrong area.

If I'm with my dog I sit on the patio and always snag some mozzarella sticks and the Head to Tail or Mandarin Wheat beer. I must also say good things about the Peanut Butter Cup Porter though, too! It's more of a desert beer for me, being a thick porter, I'm not sure I could handle more than one.   The bar inside is casual and adorned with tv's so you can keep up with whatever sports event is happening. Everyone here is always super friendly and the dogs I've seen on the patio are usually also, in general, mostly mannered.  I love the cute-dog themed bones and things around the place too. I'm usually stopping in to catch up with friends, pass the time, or just get Hank (my dog) out for an adventure. It's just my kind of hangout, I'll be back!",

I think you can bring in a photo of your dog to display on the wall - if that's True somebody LMK because I'd love to display my dogs adorable faces.   It's a watch site for KU basketball games so any place that embraces crazy KU fans (Rock Chalk!) gets a warm reception from me. It's a fantastic place to watch a game. Their food is fantastic (try the garlic parm fries - omg ). They also brew their own beer  which I didn't try but my fiance did and said it was good. He says to try the citrus wheat beer!  The service is also A+ (S/O to the waitress who helped a girl out when I needed a lady product. You the best girl). Everyone who has waited on us there has been awesome.   I'll be back Uncle Bears!

Something about the others did not taste so well. May be its the ingredients?  Possibly the water?  Idk but compared to brewery's  like desert eagle, 8bit, Sonoran, sun up, dubina, fate, Papago, AZWB, or freak n brew to name a few. The beer is very sub par. Nothing stands out. Example...I can name at least 1-2 beers in each brewery that is phenomenal. Something that brings me back for more. AZWB is a far drive from Glendale but I make the trek because of the great beer and superb food. I'm not a snob by any means. This is just an honest observation.",

    "text": "I came here on a Monday and my heart stood still Da doo ron-ron-ron, Da doo ron-ron Somebody told me that the Scorpion Sauce kills Da doo ron-ron-ron, Da doo ron-ron  Yeah. I've had beers from this brewery before - once they had their girls pushing caps and shades and free samples over at Fibber McGee's and I found that I really liked their Mandarin Wheat. So this is what I started out with one Monday evening. I was there with a friend who told me their Scorpion Sauce wings were a definite \"contendah.\" I've been meaning to come here ever since I had the wings at Teakwoods. He was curious if the wings at Uncle Bear's could compare. Not that he was gonna take the challenge himself - but he knew I would. LOL. So the moment I ordered the wings grilled and re-tossed with the Scorpion Sauce the waitress got a serious look and asked if I was sure I was sure. Adding, of course, there are no returns/refunds if I can't handle it. Bah. Bring it on I said. Do I need to sign a waiver or something? She smiled and said it wouldn't be a bad idea. *I* was starting maybe this might turn out to be a bad idea. Another waitress came over and asked if I wanted gloves for the wings. I must have rolled my eyes and maybe gave her a look like \"are you for real?\" Because she immediately told me she was TOTALLY SERIOUS. So I agreed. Maybe that would avoid a tragedy when I accidentally rubbed my eyes later on that night. So when they brought the wings they also had what looked like surgical gloves in another tray. That kinda gave me a little chill like maybe I shoulda also called for a reverend and a hearse as well. So I dug into that first wing. I felt an immediate burn. Oh crap - here it goes but I asked for it. Definite habanero flavor and habanero burn. Instant and ongoing but not enough for me to put the chicken wing down. I got through four wings before I finally needed a swig of Mandarin Wheat in a tall glass. The burn was still ongoing but I made it through most of the wings before I finished my first glass of beer. Not long after I finished the rest of the wings and then finished my garlic parmesan fries I ordered on the side. It was quite a burning sensation in my mouth I admit - that Scorpion Sauce is no slouch. Heck maybe they should be displaying the Scorpion Sauce Material Safety Data Sheet to all challengers. Our waitress told us she was washing her hands really well after grabbing my empty beer glass each time. This is because she witnessed some guy try the Scorpion Sauce wings WITHOUT the gloves once and when he had to go to the men's restroom - well let's just say when he came back he was crying. Oops. I didn't ask for any more details but I was glad I wore the gloves. So how does the Scorpion Sauce rate against my standard for hottest wings (Teakwoods)? HOT. VERY VERY VERY HOT. But not AS hot as Teakwood's. I say this because I had to have TWO swigs of beer after every individual wings at Teakwood's and I finished four tall glasses of beer by the time I was done with all of them. ANd STILL felt the burn in my mouth. So Teakwood's still reigns as the king of hot wings but this is definitely next in line. Of course - judging by my standards. Your mileage may vary. Lotsa parking - it's in a big mall with lots of other stores. Monday night wasn't too crowded but I'm sure the place gets much more packed towards the weekend.",

    "text": "Went in last night for a some dinner & drinks, and beer. Drinks were okay.  Beer was good.  Dinner however was terrible!   Ordered the Bacon Cheese fries to start with. The fries were just okay. The cheese ( what lil cheese there was) was over cooked, hard & dried onto the fries.  Ordered Black & blue Burger,  and Grilled Cheese & Bacon sandwich that came with tomato soup.   We waited probably 40 minutes for dinner aftewe finished our appetizer ( we ordered all at once). Food finally came lukewarm.  Cheese on the grilled had sat so long, that by the time I got it,  the cheese was cold,  had melted out onto plate when it was warm,  but from sitting so long it became cold,  and stuck to plate. Bread was just hard and over toasted. Was not a traditional \"grilled cheese\" rather over toated in toaster with no butter to soften or grill bread.  It came with Bacon if that's what you call the 2\" slice on each half. Lol The serving of soup was about 2 oz served in a very tiny tiny dipping bowl lol.. It was cold too!  The Burger came drenched in blue cheese dressing.  So much dressing the the bun was to soggy to pick up! Cold as well!  Dinner sucked...  First time there is the last time there...  Mediocre bar food at best. Overpriced for what we had. Do yourself a favor and go to San Tan Brewery in Chandler. Far more beers to choose from. Food is much more quality and a better price.",

It is minutes away from the hotel we were staying at for 3 days. I ordered the Texas style grilled beef burger with a order of fries and a Rasberry ice tea. The atmosphere is great with outdoor seating and the waitress even lit us up a candle at the table. Weather was great, we stopped here at 6:30pm in the afternoon. Waitress was great, she kept checking up on us in which i like. Only downside, fries were awesome, but the burger was just a tad bit bland. Had a bit of lettuce and it seem to have too much mustard on the burger. Meat was a little under seasoned, i think next time i will order something else. Other than that, love the place and atmosphere of people watching. I will be back again on my next trip.",

My fiance & I shared the queso cup, I liked the chips, but the queso was bland. I would not recommend it. I ordered a hamburger, The Old Fashioned on a wheat bun. The hamburger tasted like mustard, but there didn't seem to be a lot of mustard on the hamburger. The meat seemed to lack seasoning. Maybe I just picked the wrong burger. The fries were really good!  The service I give a 4/5. The drinks were huge which I appreciate. Our server was friendly & checked on us frequently. Also I liked that our meals didn't come 2 seconds after we got the queso.  Over all I wasn't thrilled with my food, but I would consider going again.",

    "text": "I know most of you read my reviews because I slaughter restaurants on this fine website. Well prepare to be DISAPPOINTED!. This place is AWESOME  Tonight was the first time I had ever been to an Uncle Bears, and I was prepared for another mediocre experience. The parking lot was crowded, however the restaurant shares its parking lot with a movie theater, and two trendy restaurants; Pita Jungle and Ra (sushi). It was Friday night around 5:30 pm, and the place looked very crowded, however we did not have to wait more than 10 minutes for a table. This was very rare considering some of the restaurants in the area have 20-30 minute waits.   The inside is large, however they have it sectioned off so it still feels cozy. I think they are trying to attract an older crowd based on the 70s and 80s music that was playing, but they had no less than 19 flat screens with UFC, MLB playoffs, and college football for the younger crowd. Fun for all.   Our waiter was well dressed & professional and our drinks came out quickly and accurately. Best of all their micro brew was only $4.75 per pint!!!! For our meal my wife and I ordered a bunch of little stuff... Sausage platter, hot wings, pretzel with cheese, and prime rib sliders.  EVERYTHING was good and with large portions for the money. I have had sausage platters at other micro brews and this was the best one I have had in a long time. It comes with a generous helping of a semi-spicy sausage with iceberg lettuce and bread to put the sausage on. The wings were fried to perfection and were large. The pretzel again was large and had a delicious melted cheese. The prime rib sliders were awesome however I think they would be better served with a horseradish mayonnaise. I asked for some horseradish and it came out in record time considering the place was packed.   At the end of our meal one of the owners came over to ask us about our experience. The staff was great, food was great, and it felt like the type of establishment that the owners really put their heart into. My wife and I will definitely be back.",

I DID NOT like their wings at all and would not recommend them. Great atmosphere and a good place to go drink. Food's a lil overpriced but it does sit in Ahwatukee. I highly recommend their \"craft brews\" that they brew there. Actually that's the ONLY beer you can get is \"Uncle Bears\" brewed beer. I'll be back but I won't make it a POINT to come here again. Just an okay place to go with friends. TV'S EVERYWHERE! Which makes it a good place to go to watch football. THEY ALLOW DOGS (on the patio and ON a leash\") If you take an 8 X 10\" picture of your dog AND FRAME it, they'll hang his/her picture up in memoriam! That's REALLY cool",

Food was still overly salty and covering it up with BBQ sauce doesn't work and the beers were still horrible including their mandarin wheat which is clearly trying to be a rip off of the delicious tasting Papago Orange Blossom.

I enjoy the open layout On my first visit, I really enjoyed the fajita meat, the tortillas were a bit dry and oldy tasting but oh my gosh, the PRETZEL was AMAZING. If they could make every sandwich or slider on a pretzel roll like that, it would be HEAVEN.   I was told fish tacos were also excellent.  On the second visit the pork was dry and chewy and the beer brewed sauce to go on it was non-existent.  The sandwich got lost in deep fried onion strings and I had to ask for the beer BBQ sauce which was then brought to me in a tiny plastic cup. The cheese dip was standard Velveeta like process cheese, nothing special.  Chips slightly staley tasting.  The wings were not very good due to soggy skins, too little sauce, hardly any taste and kind of chewy and too lightly flavored; just not right.    The specialty drink I ordered was good at a price of $7.50 and not very big at all.  They brought it in a Martini glass and it was definitely not a martini drink.  It should have been alot larger for the price.  The beer list is not as extensive as Mellow Mushroom across the street.  The service was great.  The music was odd but they changed it after I asked. Something young people without money might listen to.   The lighting can be interesting at certain tables.  First visit was a 5 star but this second visit was nothing special at all.  For my 2 visits, this averages to an A-OK.",

    "text": "This was my 3rd or 4th visit to Uncle Bear's, and considering that I live over a 1000 miles away I guess that says something about my liking the place.  I first heard about Uncle Bear's when they replied to a tweet I had posted while enjoying a craft beer at a nearby bar, the tweet was courtesy of the Untappd app.  While I wasn't able to make it in on that trip to Arizona, I was the next, I travel to Arizona regularly and used to live there.  The first thing that I liked about Uncle Bears is that they are not only dog themed, they are very dog friendly with dogs being allowed in the patio seating area, as a dog lover that was a real selling point for me.  As a beer lover, I am always interested in trying local craft beers, and I can say that the offerings from Uncle Bear's have been enjoyable on all occasions.  While I have only sat at the bar, or out on the patio, the service has always been excellent, and in the case of this past week, beyond what I might experience at other bars.  Even though I live in the Pacific Northwest, and I do enjoy an IPA, porters and stouts are my variety of choice and when I saw that they had a Peanut Butter Cup Porter on the menu I was pretty excited to try it.  Sadly, they were having a problem with the keg/tap and that one wasn't pouring correctly.  Deciding to go with the stereotype of being from the Pacific Northwest, I went with the West Coast IPA, which was very good.  After a couple beers I was pretty much done for the evening, and just as I was about to settle my bill, they got the tap working again and the server, who I don't remember the name, brought me a sample of the porter as he knew that I was disappointed  that it wasn't available when I arrived.  IMO, that is a very attentive bar tender.",

We ordered fish & chips which was like what you buy in the grocery store frozen food, pizza that was made wrong (caught by server though before serving) and had to be remade, spicy chicken tacos served on cold flour tortillas and a burger which was ok but overpriced. We all had finished eating when the personal pizza finally arrived, sadly not very tasty. This place is close to our house so we were hoping to find a new restaurant to frequent.",

I came on a night where the New Phoenix Times was hosting an event for the tapping of a new beer, so the place was buzzing. The also had live music to boot. Lots of people.  The Tukee Town Brown (the newly tapped beer that night) was ok... but not something I would frequently drink. Their Ocean Beach IPA was awesome though. Full of hoppiness and flavor. I would come back even if it were only to get some more of that beer.  I ordered a chicken sandwich with fries for dinner. The food is decent. Pretty standard pub grub. Enjoyable and satisfying enough to help slow down the alcohol absorption.   Overall, I had a fun time. And it's another AZ craft brewery checked off my list!",

The food comes in pretty decent portions, we ordered two entrees which had enough food to serve all 4 of us in our party (although we were not too hungry). I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries, and really enjoyed the sandwich. Pulled pork is my favorite, and they have a good combo of pulled pork, BBQ sauce, cole slaw, and fried onions on theirs. The fries were decent and on the greasier side.  I also had a bite of the prime rib sliders, which were pretty yummy!  It wasn't my favorite lunch, but it was good for a sandwich and a quick eat in the middle of the day.",

My favorite are all of the pictures of dogs throughout the restaurant. Some of the dogs are so cute it's hard to describe it.   Sometimes it seems like the french fries are cooked in oil that is slightly under temperature so they are greasy and soggy.  They have great happy hour specials and other than soggy french fries foods pretty good.   Only been there a few times so far and every time the servers have been absolutely just the biggest dolls on the planet.

After several attempts to get a drink, she finally strolled over and took our order. But asking her to switch ONE television to the Diamondback game proved to be too much to ask. After asking twice, and getting scolded (\"I can only do one thing at a time!!!\"), she switched to a baseball highlights station. Not Fox Sports. Then, refused to check on her only customers at the bar, because another employee got new glasses, and they chatted for the next 10 minutes about that stupid stuff. Honestly, I can't say enough bad things about this place. Three strikes & you're out!",

I've been coming for a few years off and on as it's been a relative middle ground for a friend and I to visit [before I moved to the Valley]. I recently took some former coworkers there as they were in Phoenix for a quick 1-night stay before heading back to Indianapolis. Once we were in town for a karaoke night which was 10000 barrels of fun - not a lot of people so we got to sing a few songs and make fools of ourselves.   Every time I've visited, I've always had phenomenal service - whether sitting in the bar area or restaurant area. The staff know when to come by and ask how we are, what to recommend based on preferences, etc etc. The management deserves a round o' applause for that.   Consistency is also a thing of beauty at Uncle Bear's. I pretty much order the same drink every time [one of the $5 Deep Eddy's] but the people I've been around have raved about their beer... which I know is sad that I order a vodka drink at a brewery, but they're delicious! The food menu has quite a selection. You can never be too sure if a place has a lot of options [sometimes it'll be good pizza, but not good burgers, etc] but they do well there too! The ex-coworkers and I got a variety of things [burgers, fried stuff, pizza, etc] and everyone raved about it!",

I also bought a six pack to bring home to drink and share with friends. I tried their chili, it was excellent! Also tried fried avocado, it sounds weird but it was great. Last we had the wings, also great. I will definitely be back with my family and our Rottie Lola.",

They will hang up a picture of your dog if you bring in an 8X10 photo in a black frame..  Lots of TV's with various sports....  This is also a brewery. I had the mandarin wheat... VERY good. Companion had the Imperial Stout.... also very good. We shared a pizza. Surprisingly, it was very good. Just enough for the 2 of us. Service was excellent.   I would have given this more stars..... HOWEVER, there was a roach running around on our table after we ate. We were unsuccessful in slaying it, and then I kept thinking it was going to crawl on me, so we left..... :-(",

Came in at 2:00 on a Tuesday (so not very crowded) but you would think they were packed given the level of service we received.   Here are the highlights: * Sat for over 10 minutes waiting to be greeted by a server.  I had to go to the hostess stand and have them track down our server. * Ordered the Mandarin Wheat Pale Ale and it was flat and watery so sent it back * Ordered the Bear's Beach Bum - WAY too much grapefruit.   It completely overpowered the beer.   *  Cheeseburger was not impressive *  Waited 15 minutes for server to bring check and finally had to track him down so we could finally leave  This is definitely somewhere we would NOT return.  Bad beer, bad service, bland food.  Do yourself a favor and go to Four Peaks or SanTan Brewery.  They are MUCH, MUCH better.",

    "text": "This will be the second time I've gone to this restaurant and BOTH occasions were GREAT experiences. I'm a huge fan of BBQ, so it only made sense to order the \"eureka springs\" BBQ pulled pork with coleslaw sandwich and a side of beer battered fries! Absolutely delicious, sweet BBQ with perfectly made coleslaw and onion string between two brioche buns!   I am pro-carbs so along with the beer battered fries as a side, I also ordered the baked pretzel (comes with creamy cheese and mustard sauces). The pretzel tasted freshly made, soft and warm upon arrival.   Pro: pretty affordable meal in my opinion (burger is $10 and change, pretzel $6-$7).  Con: Because the sandwich is pretty hefty with pork, coleslaw and onion strings.. the bottom bun isn't really able to hold it all together so if you were to lift the burger and take a bite in, the bun would essentially collapse and break apart (which happened to me.) again, it's not necessarily a dainty pretty meal you'd eat on a first date, so prepare to get your hands dirty but also prepare to use a fork and knife to gather all that goodness together.  This place is dog friendly, has various selections of beers and has pretty good customer service.",

The kids finally left with their dad, but the mom continued to pound down her beers with her now off-duty bartender friend, whose dirty work clothes are sitting on the bar.  So incredibly gauche.  Because the bartender has so little respect for her work place, I am choosing not to contact the manager.  How disappointing!",

Husband & I both had burgers. I had the New Mexico with green chiles, pepper jack & onion strings on wheat bun- it was pretty good, patty was big, greasy & tasty although it could have been cooked just a tad more, (menu says they cook patties to medium-well but it was still a bit too pink, but tasty nonetheless) beer-battered fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy A+.

    "text": "I've only ever gotten the grilled cheese and soup here- I've been twice but I just HAD to get it a second time because it was SO GOOD the first time! But if I'm being honest, the grilled cheese alone is enough to deserve 5 stars. The sandwich, the tomato bisque, and the fries were all exceptional. The atmosphere was nice, but then again I wasn't really paying much attention to anything other than the emotional connection I was having with my otherworldly grilled cheese sandwich. The host and wait staff has also been very pleasant and attentive both times. Also a plus that they're so welcoming to doggies (wish I could bring my dogs out in public without experiencing Non-stop Barkfest 2k16).",

Very cool place to take people from out of town. My favorite place to sit is in the bar but anyplace is a good place to sit. They will also teach you about home brewing.",

I was not impressed with any of the beers we sampled. too light or too dark, couldn't find one that was just perfect. My husband had the wings and said they were too saucy. Cool bar are, with dogs allowed on patio is a definite plus! Over all a good place to watch a game and have a beer with your dog.",

The situation was soon rectified by a manager and a waiter that took care of things from there out.  They bought us a round, the food came and then the place was enjoyable.  The OB Fish Platter with Cod, was tasty.  It wasn't \"BIG\" like the menu said, but tasty for fried fish and fries.  The Margherita Pizza topped with arrugula was tasty, but not out of this world.  The dog friendly theme and patio were cute.  I'd try it again, but I'm probably going to sit at the bar, so my beer doesn't get warm waiting for delivery to the table by an overworked waitress.",

I think the beer might be delicious but if you order a tall (mug) the glass was as warm as if out of the dishwasher. This of course warmed the beer up. I ordered a regular pint also but this glass was also not chilled.  Surprising because well, it's a brewery. I'd expect care to be taken in serving cold beer.",

    "text": "I happened to walk by here a few weeks ago and saw that something was going in this spot, which has been a black hole for restaurants over the years. I happened to walk by again the other night and saw the place was open so decided to try it out last night.  It was a nice night to sit on the patio, and others had the same idea. Not too many people inside but the place is new. The outside patio had a smoking area and a smaller non smoking area. There was no space in the non smoking area, and the bar had no seats so I was thinking of leaving because I really wanted to sit outside. They caught us before we left and found stools for us which I thought was nice.  The beers were interesting, and I am looking forward to a few weeks from now when they start having porters and stouts.  I had the Mac and cheese and it was very good. There was a solid bacon flavor in there and they somehow kept the bacon crispy throughout the dish. Nicely done. My old lady had a pizza which I wasn't crazy about but I am really picky about pizza.  So I don't expect much from bar pizza.  The staff was quite nice.  All in all, a good experience. I think I will be back.",

    "text": "This was my third visit to Uncle Bear's and most likely my last. The service was incredibly slow from the beginning.  My family arrived before me and asked to be seated at an outdoor patio table when one became available.  Two outdoor tables became available shortly after I arrived.  I watched the two tables being cleared and the girl at the reception desk hadn't notice the empty tables until my son said he'd bus the table if it meant we could be seated for lunch.  That's when the girl behind the desk said she was waiting for the table to be cleared and I told her they were cleared.  That's when she  picked up some menus and walked us to the outdoor patio.    Justin was our server and he seemed new and completely out of his element--perhaps just learning or not the right job for him.  He asked if we wanted to order and I asked if they had a Sauvignon Blanc and he looked at me blankly so I told him it was a white wine and he said he didn't know and pointed to the drink menu and said \"the wine is on there.\"    I ordered the Asian chicken salad with dressing on the side: it came with the dressing on the salad.  Justin told me there was another one in the back and he'd get it for me and I said okay at first then thought it better to keep this one because there was no telling when he'd actually make it back to the table.  The chicken coating was so hard I could barely cut it with my knife.  Thankfully the lettuce was good or I wouldn't have had anything to eat.  My son had the fajitas and his tortillas were old, dry, and hard.  My daughter-in-law had the lettuce pork wraps and the lettuce was so wet her lap quickly filled with the excess water.  The only one at our table who did not have a complaint about their food was my four year-old granddaughter who ordered the cheese pizza.  When I suggested to my son that he ask for fresher tortillas, he said \"no, I know as a former server what servers do to food that people send back.  I'll just eat the old and hard tortillas, but I don't like this place anymore.\"    If it was possible to not have to select one star to post a review I would have done it.  This place didn't earn or deserve even one star today.",

Arrived at the restaurant 30 minutes after the call and the food wasn't ready, but was told it was almost done. Over 20 minutes later the food arrived, but when I got it home it was barely warm. My guess was at least part of it was sitting around for a while, waiting for some other part of the meal they forgot about to be finished. A manager showed up near the end of the wait, and then disappeared to look for the food, which showed up why he was gone. Never saw or heard from him after he went to look for the food. This wouldn't have been quite as bad if they had just said they screwed up and it wasn't ready. Instead, they kept saying it was almost ready, which wasn't True. Hard to evaluate the quality of the food since it had sat around so long. I doubt I will be back except maybe to try some of the beers.",
