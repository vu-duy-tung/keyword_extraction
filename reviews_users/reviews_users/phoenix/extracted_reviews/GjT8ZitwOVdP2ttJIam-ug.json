The restaurant was clean, customer service excellent, and it only took @ 6 minutes to get my order to go. I got home and everything was packed perfectly. I ordered the curry special, and it really was special. If you order your curry \"hot\"  have no doubt it will be. I'm looking forward to trying other items on the menu. I would highly recommend this restaurant to both vegan and non vegan friends. Winner winner vegan chicken dinner!!",

I ordered the thai tea boba and drank it so fast it was gone before my food even came out! For entrees I ordered the dumpling curry and my husband got the pad thai. I was so excited that I had left overs so that I could experience my food again for lunch the next day. I think this will be a good location for us when we're in Phoenix and want a quick, cheap vegan lunch. Although the indoor decor is nothing fancy and a tad on the 'hippie' side, I hope people will give this place a chance! Parking can probably be limited although we got the meter spot right in front mid-day Sunday. Also, make sure you close the front door all the way! The poor guy had to keep running to the front to pull it shut to conserve AC. Thanks for being an all-vegan restaurant! Keep it up!",

The vegan shrimp is a real experience, the texture is quite unique and it worked with the pumpkin peanut curry, another unique dish.   The Seafood clay pot was a ginger shotgun blast to the face, full of veggies glass noodles and mock seafood.  Other dishes like the green curry were great as was the fried tarro. Another nice thing is that this place is nice, clean and modern and a bit more formal than most veg places in town. If you have a vegitairian or vegan date this is the place to go.",

And because of that, I can appreciate the new kid on the block (girl you know it's True...oh wait, that's Milli Vanilli) which is why I was excited Vegan House is finally opened.   It's not often that I take lunch outside the office. So, today was a treat. And that treat started with a lovely cup of soup. It should be said, I'm not really a soup lover. The idea of occupying so much stomach space to what's nothing more than flavored water seems like a dining mistake. But this soup was good! The veggie roll appetizers were terrific. Crispy and flavorful, they really were a great pre-entree option. My Jungle Noodles were a great blend of fresh veggies and dense tofu. It was all the right stuff, baby. On that note, I asked if the tofu had been smoked because the texture was more meaty, with a firm exterior with just the right amount of bite. Turns out, they quickly fry it; amazing! I'd ordered mild and it was far too mild for my tastes. Next time, I'll be certain to get it hotter. Or maybe next time I'll try something else from the menu.",

For dinner I had the Buddha's Delight with soy chicken. It's a mix of veggies, soy chicken, and their house sauce. It was satisfying and not too overfilling. House sauce flavor was fantastic.

The Yellow Curry with Soy Chicken, which came with rice, was very flavorful and had exactly the right amount of spice for a curry dish.  The portion was good and they were not skimpy with the vegan chicken. It was a very filling dish and I had enough for 2 days.   On the second visit, I ordered the Grand Tempura.  This dish is an appetizer, but was large enough to be a meal for me. It came with tempura battered vegan chicken, vegan shrimp, and assorted vegetables. I spotted broccoli, red bell peppers, onions, and sweet potatoes amongst my veggie variety.   The tempura dish came with a delicious sweet chili dipping sauce.  The problem is that they only give you one sauce, all of which you'll sop up 1/2 way through this dish.  An extra sauce is $2. TWO dollars for a 0.25-0.50 cent cup of sauce.  Outrageous. The dish should come with 2 sauces already, based on its size.    I don't like feeling that I've been over-charged, so this issue has kept me away for almost a year.  Being that the food was good, I plan to give them another try, one day. 4 1/2-star food, 2 1/2 stars for petty larceny.",

Extremely disappointed. Also ordered the veggie rolls. Which were surprisingly good lol Go here if your car broke down outside and you're not really hungry but you're trying to stay out the heat and order veggie rolls and ask for water. ",

I'm not even Vegan and was impressed by the food.  The only caveat was the restaurant only had one server for the entire restaurant which was packed. He took both to go & sit down orders, brought waters & drinks, bussed the tables, and brought our checks. He was literally running around the entire time. I felt so bad for him. Because of this, the wait was long to order, at least 15 mins before he had an opportunity to come take our order. Food came out in a decent amount of time. Probably won't return for the weekend or when I'm really hungry. They need to get the guy some help. He was really nice.",

Can't wait to go back! Yes, love starting a review like this. First off, I had their \"chicken yellow curry\" and man it was one of THE BEST curries I've ever had. It had the perfect amount of veggies, vegan chicken strips and rice that came with it. I went for lunch so it came with a small salad and soup which was delicious as well. My gf had their pad thai which is not at all like a traditional pad thai (with peanut sauce)  she said it was more of a tamarind base. We also started with an appetizer of fried sweet potato and Taro (absolutely dee-lish). Service was perfect, visited during the week for lunch. Can't wait to go back. Give them a shot, you won't be disappointed.",

However, everything was pretty amazing:  the food, the customer service and the ambiance.    We started with an appetizer of vegetable dumplings.  A good appetizer for one, but too small a serving to share.  It was so good!  My husband ordered the \"shrimp\" clay pot and it was delicious!  I ordered the Praluck - grilled mock chicken over a bed of spinach and brown rice with peanut sauce.  YUMMY!  All the ingredients were fresh and homemade in-house.  Speaking of homemade in-house, we had the fried bananas with coconut ice-cream for dessert and it was absolutely delicious!!  It was so good.  They make the ice-cream there and it was perfect alongside the warm fried bananas.  Definitely coming back for this!  Our server was friendly and went out of her way to help when our toddler was having a tough time sitting in the booth.  They didn't yet have high chairs in the restaurant but saw our difficulty in keeping a toddler in one place.  So she went to a nearby restaurant and borrowed one of their highchairs!  Amazing!  The highchairs are coming soon.    Our family will definitely be back!  Welcome to Phoenix, Vegan House!",

The peanut noodle dish was really heavy with a lot of sauce, but still tasty...if you order it, just be sure you're in the mood for peanut!  I was able to split it up into three meals since the portion size is so large.  The orange chicken was really delicious, with crispy \"chicken\" and very sweet sauce that complemented the savory flavor nicely.

The dining room was not crowded at all, but we still had to wait over half an hour for our food and it was incredibly unclear exactly what everybody's job was supposed to be (servers stepping in to work the deep fryers, a lot of casual conversation and standing around, etc). When we asked for our order to go because we couldn't wait any longer, it took another 15 minutes for the order to come out.  When we finally sat down to eat, the meal was disappointing overall. My salad was swimming in dressing, and my fiance's sandwich had way too much vegan mayo spread on it and was very bland.  I am normally pretty forgiving about kitchen delays, but I felt like the situation was not handled well at all. The server we had barely spoke to us at all and took a long time to respond to any requests made of the guests. Additionally, I felt like they kept staring at us and they seemed to be acting weirdly.   In short, I would say this restaurant is not worth the wait. We were very disappointed by our experience.",

I got the pad Thai with soy chicken (a little weird, but very tasty soy chicken) and my wife got the orange chicken. The orange chicken was very good, I took a lot of that from my wife's plate. We got the fried banana and Cicinho ice cream for dessert which was incredible. They actually take whole pieces of banana and deep fry them (not the healthiest l, but really good). Again, overall it was really good, I'd definitely come back here again.",

    "text": "Vegan House is the only 100% vegan restaurant within walking distance of most downtown events. The menu offers diverse options for those following a plant-based diet and people who just want to eat healthy food. I've been dining here since they opened, and am slowly making my way through the expansive menu. They are open for lunch and dinner every day, and lunch specials on weekdays.   My favorite dish is the fresh ginger stir fry. I've had it with mock chicken and tofu, but want to try the mock beef next time I visit. Other items I've tried and liked: dumpling curry (which is listed on their online menu as \"dumping\" curry - fix that!), green curry, house fried rice, veggie rolls, pot stickers, praluck, onion and black pepper stir fry, jungle noodle and soy chicken wrap. All are great! I'm surprised that they don't have a red curry, given they are a Thai restaurant. Their online menu lists one of my Thai favorites - Tom Kha Kai (Thai coconut soup) but it's not on their printed menu so I haven't tried it yet but want to if it's available. The one item that everyone loves - orange soy chicken - is great, but it doesn't come with veggies so I get a bit bored just eating chicken chunks. They offer different levels of spice for stir fries and curries, but don't tend to over spice. Ordering \"medium\" gives you a hint of flavor, but is not overpoweringly spicy. The veggies are fresh and crispy.   The main downside of Vegan House is that they don't staff appropriately. We were there on a Saturday night when there were several events happening downtown, a big vegetarian festival in Scottsdale that attracted vegan tourists, and a convention. They only had one waiter, who was literally running from table to table. We saw some people wait for awhile and leave without having been acknowledged, and I think I may have seen someone dodge their check because they were tired of waiting. We were served promptly and pleasantly (in part because we knew what we wanted and didn't ask questions like most tables around us did), but it was stressful watching him stress out! I'm glad to see so many people interested in dining there, but they can't sustain the business if they can't serve all their eager customers promptly!",

My kids (6&9), she and I went. I poured over all the delicious sounding dishes and settled on the green curry with tofu and vegetables. It. Was. Phenomenal. From the first bite of the flavor packed curry I was having a foodgasim! The brown rice is so nutty and yummy. My niece had the orange chicken, I was -almost- jealous. It was so good too. I can also recommend the Mongolian seafood rice and the spaghetti with meat and mushrooms. (When I refer to meat/chicken etc, I mean the vegan substitute). My oldest son even said the atmosphere was relaxed . Go there! You won't regret it. Oh, have the potsticker!",

For medium, it was pretty good spicy level.  But it was like Chinese Chow Fun...  I would definitely go back and try other things on the menu, if back in this area.

After getting my delicious smelling (and tasting) meal, I ate some and noticed little red pepper bits throughout the sauce, so I couldn't continue. It was super uncomfortable all night from the allergic reaction from the food. I'd absolutely go again, but I'd have to be even more clear (I guess?) about my allergies?",

Walked in to be greeted by smiling, friendly staff. Started off with a shared order of delicious Veggies Pot Stickers. Followed that with a spectacular Pad Thai with soy chicken and my daughter had Peanut Sauce Noodle, which she thought was terrific. When we debated but said we were going to skip dessert because we were full, the manager brought us each a Sweet Banana Spring Roll with red and green sprinkles. What a wonderful place to have our Christmas lunch. My only regret is that I live 2400 miles away and can't stop by Vegan House more often!",

One thing I didn't love was the restaurant was pretty cold, I heard the people next to us make the same comment and I was cold the entire meals, but we ordered some hot tea and food and pretty much forgot! Another thing I wish they had was some hot coffee, they had iced drinks but we were freezing! I will come back here for sure.",

I will admit they do have a great staff who greet you warmly and have a good attention to table side manner. That is one reason why they got two stars. That and the fact that the service was very quick. I do appreciate that. Also a fair warning if you do go to the play there is no parking unless you want to pay for it being how it's downtown. So bring some extra cash if you're going to go here. As for the food well that became a different issue all together. Ordered the spring rolls as the appetizer These were 5 rolls containing a very nicely toasted tofu wrapped in lettuce, carrots and rice in a rice wrap and a peanut curry dip.  While the roll were good and the curry dip was tasty but honestly it needed a bit more peanut flavor. Then came the main course and the big disappointment. It was an orange vegan chicken dish with a Thai spiciness. While the chicken was OK  and the spiciness was to my liking it was the orange garnish itself that was terrible. It had a unpleasant twang to it that made it very hard to swallow. I always finish my dishes but this time I had to just walk away. Hate to say it but I had to say enough and stop eating. This place have a good atmosphere but like I said food taste was unfortunately the opposite. Maybe it was that dish but it couldn't measure up. Too bad too I was hoping it would as I love vegan orange chicken.",

This place had incredible tempura selections - the grand tempura dish is neat with all the variety you could want. The tempura soy chicken was my favorite, followed by the onion and shrimp. The tempura pepper was a little weird, but still an overall solid dish. It's hearty and not the healthiest fried option, but doesn't make you feel totally gross like other fried food. The sweet potato and taro dish is also great for a fatty starchy craving.  The pad Thai was okay, but the portion was smaller compared to the tempura. Same with the summer rolls; decent but nothing to write home about.  The fried banana and coconut dessert was super tasty, but would have probably appreciated it more if we hadn't eaten two other tempura fried dishes.  Will definitely be back for all my unhealthy savory Asian food cravings!!!",

Just like a good comfort food whenever you might be having a shitty day...or a happy day...The peanut noodle was also really yummy. I find that peanut sauce noodles often clump together, therefore taking away from the experience. Their noodles didn't stick together all that much, thank goodness!  There's a huge list of things that I really want to try on their menu. A lot of alternative/faux meats to choose from if you enjoy that kind of veganism...a lot of vegetable/tofu dishes as well.

I ordered the pad Thai with tofu, definitely tasty but I realized there was nowhere to specify the amount of heat I wanted on the order form. So there was little to no spice on mine, so make sure to add that in your comments section.  Also tried the fried taro/ sweet potatoes and they were cooked perfectly and were all the delicious unhealthy fried goodness that I needed.

There were only two other patrons in the restaurant when I arrived so I was quickly seated , given a menu and ordered.   I decided on some dish that reminded me of drunken noodles with tofu.   My food arrived hot and steaming much to my delight. I eagerly dug in and was surprised at how flavorful the food was.   The tofu was cooked perfectly and the vegetables were yummy.

I got the fried rice as a main with the soy chicken It was soggy and soft. Not the way I like it. I would recommend asking for extra vegetables and steering clear of the meat substitutes next time. If you like things spicy you are going to have to ask for hot or thai hot. I ask for medium and got mild. The Green curry is also a great dish. Cant wait to come back for the veggie pot stickers.",

Just so you know, convenience is important when temperatures are hovering around the century mark for this climatically fragile Californian. I was pretty amazed at how desolate downtown Phoenix became after 5PM, but I wanted something relatively light for dinner before exploring the First Friday activities up on Roosevelt Row. It was pretty empty, and the server scurried over to me to make sure I didn't get away. She said to me, \"I hope you know this a vegan restaurant.\"  Considering the name, I told her that yes, I was aware and looking forward to trying their food. They certainly offered plenty of dishes on their menu like Spaghetti, Green Curry and Pad Thai. I started with the $12 Shrimp Salad with vegan shrimp tossed with onion, tomato, avocado, cucumber, and lemongrass, all of it mixed in a spicy lime juice dressing (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2uJwuFt&s=0d64738e767b26cd4b2fd0c5fd970e52167c0dca08f1636c4cc96b2b8597c971\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2uJwuFt</a>). It was a good, fresh salad, just nothing extraordinary when it came to flavor. I decided to complement it with the $5 Steam Mix Vegetables, which was your typical variety of steamed vegetables - zucchini, carrot, broccoli, green beans, and a lot of cabbage (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2uMXbHF&s=0822ec40660986080ff899f685b0aebcf5a0a88934f482d712d021df53e81071\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2uMXbHF</a>). It was what I needed.  FOOD - 3 stars...the ingredients are fine but the execution leaves something to be desired even for this flexitarian AMBIANCE - 3 stars...clean, just nothing special SERVICE - 3.5 stars...they seem to try TOTAL - 3 stars...flavors can be elusive in a vegan place",

For apps we ordered the summer rolls to share - OUTSTANDING!  Honestly the best I have ever had - the texture of the nonmeat protein was so awesome, great fresh flavors and the two sauces they serve it with or over-the-top good!  For entrees my non-vegan friend ordered the jungle noodles and loved them.  My other friend and I both ordered the pumpkin peanut butter bowl - she loved hers - me not so much :(. I found the dish to be way too saucy and thick for me and my vegetables were overcooked.  I hate to send anything back but when I explained to our server she was very nice and apologized that she thought the chef had gotten a bit in the weeds in the kitchen - she quickly ordered up a lighter dish, spicy ginger stirfry I think - The vegetables were cooked crunchy it was light and super delicious - a perfect second try!  The purple rice is one of the best offerings, and it's the standard rice they serve - love it... The portions are big, right on point for what you pay... Nice to have the owner stop by with her baby to see how we were doing and chat with us at our table for several minutes.  I will absolutely be back for some more summer rolls and to try some other dishes - even my carnivore friend said she might give it another try... Thank you Vegan House!",

However, after the first bite of their orange chicken tofu (mild spice optionally added) I was hooked. Their house fried rice with broccoli was just as good. They tasted better than any real orange chicken and chicken fried rice I have ever had. I will be going again although, since I'm no talented cook who can remake such masterpieces, I will only be eating vegan when I come here.",

After 5 minutes of no service I walked to the front and asked for a menu and once again waited. After 15 minutes somebody finally took my order and I waited patiently for some water. No joke 35 minutes later (the restaurant was practically empty by then) me food AND water arrived. This place is great but if you don't have at least an hour to wait for food go elsewhere.",

I ordered the fried rice and it was not very good. They used (for some crazy reason) short grained rice. That is NOT the type of rice you use for fried rice.

Earthly colors all over.  These ain't yo mama's fast food gotta-eat-meat colors.  You can free your mind (and your ass will follow) while you sit and wait for food. You may just break out the aromatherapy and start a meditation chant while your Qi comes in equilibrium with the cosmos.  Currently the hours are everyday from 11 AM to 9 PM so I hope the downtown crowd makes use of their hospitality.  Lunch Specials are M-F 11PM-3PM.  They have togo menus too and deliver within a mile radius.  The extensive menu includes appetizers, soup, salads, tempura,  noodles, rice, sandwiches, wraps, and desserts.  And although most of the meals are typical, they are delicious vegan and vegetarian Thai / american.     Cooked up and served by a staff that cares about their clients' allergies.  \"Was I allergic to soy or peanuts\" they asked me.  When was the last time that happened at a restaurant?  And now for the food:  1. MC salad.  What a surprise!  Flavor exploded in my mouth.  It's mostly mango and carrot with sauteed onion and peanuts on top of romaine lettuce.  I think they used some carrot dressing too.  Sweet and tangy to taste.  Worth it!  2. Green Curry.  Creamy coconut milk with veggies.  Love it!  I could probably drink the coconut milk by itself.  3. Eggplant.  Delicious, but a little on the oily side.    All were flavorful.  Not salty  Thumbs up to Vegan House.  Vegan in da house!  Woop woop woop!",

Two of us had the Pad Thai with the soy chicken and one had the jungle noodles.  I thought it was pretty good, but the jungle noodles was lacking somewhat in flavor.  Vegan House is a good vegan restaurant, but if you're not vegan or don't have a reason to not eat meat, you may not care for the meat substitutions.  My mother is a super picky eater and she liked the soy chicken pad thai, but if it hadn't been lent, she probably would not have eaten here.",

While passing through Phoenix on a Sunday evening, we were struggling to find a vegan restaurant moderately close to the freeway that was open. I'm really glad that we landed on this place.  Vegan House is relatively new and I hope it does well as the food was flavorful, the service was friendly and attentive, and, as vegans, it's always a joy to be able to eat anything on the menu.  I would say that maybe there are a few too many choices on that menu, as it contains, in addition to Thai standards, a number of other disparate cuisines. Not many restaurants can pull off both curry and spaghetti.   I got the Pumpkin Peanut Curry (PPC) with tofu. It was everything I love in one bowl. The tofu had a nice crispiness to it and contrasted nicely with the soft pumpkin. The sauce was rich and had the perfect level of spiciness (I got medium. I could probably have even gone a little higher.) My companion, looking for something less rich, went with the soy chicken wrap, which, though simple, was refreshing. The fries weren't perfect--a bit soft and salty--but as I mentioned earlier, we didn't expect that to be entirely within their wheelhouse.   Overall though, a positive experience. Vegan House, we are so glad to have found you and wish you all the best.",

I found the service excellent and the food ravingly good. The overall theme of the menu is Thai. I love Thai food and this is really some very good vegan Thai food. I would love to eat here again. But I don't live in Phoenix so it will be a while before I might get the chance to come back.",

    "text": "So, my flight into Phoenix tonight involved an emergency abandonment of the landing by our capable pilot. A little shaken, I got to my hotel and decided to grab a kiltlifter beer and order vegan takeout. Yeah, I am a little messed up right now.   Surprisingly, I am enjoying dinner. The vegetable gyoza were crispy and delicious, coming with a spicy dipping sauce. The edamame were fine, slightly over cooked for my liking but well salted. Yellow curry was my main course. Solid dish with some complexity of flavor I enjoyed. Fried rice seemed small for the price. It was the least favorite component of the meal. Dessert was the classic Thai dish of fresh mango on purple rice with a cream to bring the two together. Awesome.   Overall, not sure I would order this for my last meal but I certainly enjoyed it as my next meal!",

    "text": "I was so excited to try Vegan House that it was my first stop in Phoenix. I came on a day that was extra slammed because of a juice convention happening nearby and more than a normal amount of plant based people in the area, so the service was a bit messy and slow.   The food didn't impress me the way I'd hoped either. I ordered Jungle Noodles with vegan shrimp, and the flavor was just meh. The vegan shrimp looked like real shrimp, but tasted more or less like nothing. I dined with someone who ordered avocado rolls that were essentially summer rolls with a little avocado added. There wasn't much avocado, so it was mostly greens wrapped in rice paper. She also had the orange chicken, which I tried and that was pretty good.  Despite an average lunch, I decided to order for dinner because I couldn't find a lot of vegan delivery options near my hotel. 20 minutes after I ordered, I got a notice saying they had canceled. They apparently decided not to use the delivery service anymore and never told anyone. I was disappointed and wasted a lot of time since I had to order something else.  When everything is added together, I am just meh about this place, but I do like that there is an all vegan option in downtown Phoenix, so 3 Stars it is.",

    "text": "Vegan House was a pleasant surprise during my stay in downtown Phoenix. It was thankfully located very close to my hotel and is pretty much right in the heart of the city. Once I walked in I was greeted warmly and quickly shown to my table, offered a menu and some water and time to review my choices.   I'm a sucker for Orange \"Chicken\" as it's probably the only thing I've ever missed since becoming vegetarian. So when I see it on the menu I have to try it, and I did here as well. You can choose your spice level and I ordered mine hot. I like spice. Bring on the spice, make me sweat a bit if you have to, but for all means I want to taste the spice. Sadly this is where the one star was removed as it was not nearly as spicy as I wanted. It was more like the PG-13 of spice levels, it gives you a hint of what's going on without the full blown impact.   The side salad I ordered was tasty and artistically presented. It was a bit larger than I would have expected. Then came out the orange \"chicken\". The consistency was good, not too dense but not too soft. A notion of crunch on the outside and a decent amount of sauce. Accompanying the dish was some brown rice and some steamed broccoli and a few carrot stars. These were delicious and complemented the dish quite well. Again my only complaint was the lack of spice. However I'll know better next time to order it blazing hot.  The menu is quite extensive with very creative sounding faux meat dishes. I'm looking forward to trying more when I return if I'm in town again. The prices are reasonable, the service is prompt and efficient. I'm pleased to have dined here and highly recommend.",

It was 45 minutes until closing time (which we thought we can just order and go if need be) and we walked in and they immediately walked to the front door as people are eating and said \"SORRYY we're closed\" a bit rudely. I'm sorry but what kind of service is this?... not to mention their OPEN sign was on and it closed at 9pm who closes a whole 45 min before hand. I have never been turned away from a business before, especially when you are trying to give them your money. So it's great that everyone else thinks they're friendly wish I could've found out. I may try again in the future, not sure as of yet. Will find another vegan place to dine at. Feel free to share some other vegan eats if possible in the Phoenix area :)",

    "text": "We landed just after lunch time in Phoenix on a Sunday. My first choice in vegan restaurants was closed, so we ended up at Vegan House which was near our hotel. We started with the summer rolls, which were a little disappointing for the price and size of the appetizer. I think that $8 for two small summer rolls is quite overpriced. I couldn't really taste all the ingredients listed. They were decent though. I ordered the orange soy chicken, medium spicy. Vegan orange chicken is kind of \"my thing\" and it's hard for me to not order it when I see it on a menu. It was very good, not over-fried, and the spice level was exact to my preference. I also liked the mixed grain rice it came with. My companion ordered the soy chicken wrap. It didn't look that great but she said it was pretty good. The fries were less than thrilling. When I tasted them, they were very bland and perhaps not quite cooked enough. I would pass on the fries there. I would've gone back and tried something else if I'd been in Phoenix longer and if my non-vegan companion had seemed more thrilled with her meal. The service was very pleasant, attentive, and friendly.",

I decided the yellow curry was in my cards and ordered the lunch version which comes with soup, salad, rice and a cup of coconut curry with tofu (great deal at $9!). The soup is a tasty cabbage veggie broth. Once I finished the soup I went to the coconut curry. It is so rich and creamy- no description can do the tastiness justice. Do not let the \"spicy\" note next to it deter you. You can pick mild, medium or hot. For drinks they have a ton of tea, milk and soda options but my must is the iced green tea. Most places only carry the hot so the iced is a must!   If you are looking for a really great healthy meal Vegan House is a must!   Eat local!",

    "text": "Back at Vegan House for dinner. My taste buds remind me I don't get back here often enough!   The restaurant sits on Adams street in the middle of the block. Sixth President John Quincy Adams' favorite food was fruit of all kinds. Because of his European upbringing as the son of 2nd President John Adams, (who the street is named after), I think he would completely enjoy Vegan House if he were here today!  Vegan House's menu is of course Vegan and the food delicious. In 2018 Vegan House was named one of the best vegan seafood restaurants.   My wife and I ordered the Soy Chicken Wrap, Veggie Pot Stickers, Summer Rolls, Grand Tempura, and Orange Soy Chicken / Tempura Tofu.   We are so lucky and privileged that the God of Tempura smiles upon Vegan House! The Grand Tempura is comprised of multiple veggies, vegan shrimp, onion rings, and vegan chik'n. Each golden piece is crispy and deliciously fried after being coated in a vegan tempura batter.   Likewise the Tempura Tofu unleashes a crispy golden warm taste sensation the likes of which we mere mortals only get lucky enough to experience rarely.   The crispy fried food is contrasted by the absolutely fresh veggies in their Summer Rolls and the mid-level doughy goodness of veggie Potstickers.   Whether vegan or not, for those lucky enough to be living in and around downtown Phoenix, Vegan House has to be a favorite! It's a nice place, excellent service, diverse menu, and great food.   For non-vegans it's an excellent place to eat healthy and try new things. There is vegan fish, shrimp, lots of professionally prepared veggies, soups, salads, curry, speciality vegan seafood dishes, and yes - golden tempura.   I'll make a point of getting back there more often and maybe cya there!",

We ordered Buddha's Delight and Onion & Black Pepper with tofu and veggies. We ordered it extra spicy and the spice level met our expectations. They serve some kind of red rice with their entrees instead of white rice and it's very delicious. We will surely visit again. Vegan House didn't disappoint us.",

    "text": "Don't be a chicken, try the vegan orange chicken. I swear by every bone in my body that this is the best vegan chicken I've had in a restaurant. In fact, I became skeptical. Were they tricking me? Eventually I asked, \"Was this actually real chicken?\" She laughed and said the entire restaurant is vegan.   There are very few places I would recommend taking even the most skeptical of carnivores, but this one would be it. Make sure to ask for your specified heat level, because it wasn't as spicy as I would have enjoyed. *I want to sweat.*  I'd recommend eating in, but if you do have to do take out then try re-heating them under the broil until they brown. Otherwise it's not the same experience by a landslide because the breading gets soggy.   My only dislike was the rice. It's Thai sticky rice, which means that it's mushier and sweeter. I like to try new things, but I'm a big proponent of plain old white rice. I'd be nice if that was an option.   I went alone and I was one among many enjoying a solo meal. I can't wait to take my friends and family back!",

Saw the sign for avocado curry posted outside the restaurant, and I just knew I had to try it.  Never even thought of this combination before, but it seemed to make a lot of sense.   And was it delicious!  The avocado brings a refreshing twist to curry.  The creaminess of the avocado makes it the ideal substitution for dairy.  Actually, there is no substitute.  Avocado is far better!  I will make this switch for my home curry from now on.",

Hard time choosing what I wanted. My friend and I ended up getting the potstickers (SO GOOD), fried tofu with a peanut sauce (good), green chicken curry (delicious on the rice) and orange chicken (the chicken itself was wonderful, the sauce was good but wasnt exactly the taste I was looking for). We wanted the banana chocolate dessert roll but they were out. Another table next to us was also raving about how good their food was and ordered more to go. I would definitely return to this place. Prices are fair as well. As always... now Im craving...",

The restaurant was not busy for 7:00 PM on a weekday with just two tables occupied. It was very clean and well lit. I was greeted as soon as I walked to the counter and was given a menu.   I need to say, in case it's not obvious, EVERYTHING is vegan here. There are no meat options. I found the menu extensive with a variety of non-meat options. I decided on an appetizer of veggie rolls (5 total) and yellow curry that was \"Thai hot\". My protein choice was tofu and veggies. The veggie rolls were crisp, not oily with an inside that was flavorful and filled with plenty of vegetables. My curry was delicious. Plenty of tofu and potatoes as well as a nice amount of vegetables. The spice level was perfect for me...I love my food spicy so the Thai hot was a welcome surprise. I'd give it 4 out of 5 on the heat scale.   Overall a great option for vegan takeout. I will return when I'm back in Phoenix.",

I had: L8 GREEN CURRY (Green curry with coconut milk, onion, bamboo, bell pepper, eggplant and sweet basil with tofu or chicken and rice) and for dessert: BANANA IN COCONUT CREAM  The Green Curry dish was very hearty and big enough to share. It wasn't so much green, more like yellow curry, but not really an important detail, right? I liked that the tofu wasn't soggy, only done by baking the tofu prior to adding to main dish, very important when using in a soup or broth based dish. Wasn't spicy at all. Soup was't full of the listed veggies, I could've had a bit more.  The Banana in Coconut Cream was very basic but good. The banana was ripe enough to sweeten the dish. Not a pleasant color, in fact if you judge food by how it looks this might turn you off, it's just very colorless, reminded me of cement before it hardens and is very soupy. It has a light taste but only if you share.  Restaurant is open on the weekends and into the evening which is a big plus for those downtown type of nights and weekends. Be prepared to pay for parking since there isn't any free nearby parking.",

I do think the name \"Vegan House\" might be deceiving for some as it doesn't really have any implications that it is soley Thai. Three words: pumpkin peanut curry. I'm salivating just thinking about theirs. It's so good! Also their spring rolls are a great appetizer to try- huge and bursting with flavor including mock chicken (I'm usually not a fan of mock meats but I was really impressed with how this tastes) on lovely rice paper. It would be nice if they served alcohol but luckily they are in a location that's close to bars to hit up after. Adorable little restaurant and extremely friendly staff. If you are vegan or appreciate vegan options and like Thai food, I think you'll appreciate this place.",

Orange soy chicken fake meat is good consistency.  Overall a good vegan restaurant in downtown area.",

Parking meter was $1.50/hr, limit two hours on weekends.  We ordered the Summer Rolls, which were fresh and tasty and came with two sauces, a sweet and tangy sauce and a frothy peanut sauce - both sauces were good.   We also tried the FLT, a sandwich with fries. The fish reminded me of tofurkey if it were wrapped in seaweed and sliced. The sandwich was fresh and okay, but needed something like a tarter sauce. The Soy Chicken Wrap was also fresh and okay, but dry and could have used some vegan ranch dressing. Both sandwich and wrap had only a tiny bit of veganaise and were otherwise too dry. Extra sauce next time.  The Dumping [sic] Curry and Peanut Pumpkin Curry were both really good. I could have eaten a plate of the dumplings alone. Both came with what looked like black (forbidden) rice.",

I got medium in peace knowing that it was the second tier of a four tier spectrum and it delivered the promised spice for once in my Thai food tasting life!  I also enjoyed the free soup that I was told came with \"pretty much\" every meal on their lunch menu during their lunch special.  While I found it a bit thin, it hit the spot while myself and my new co-worker (and replacement) who I was in Phoenix to train waited for our main course.  And what a main course it was!  Getting the orange fake chicken at a Thai place was a risky choice.  But they made it with such care that the orange flavoring was on every single morsel of fake chicken.  And it was a delicious sauce that, while it overpowered the protein, did not make me mind on bit.  In fact, the very large bowl of rice they give you on the side ended up being an orangey mess of rice goodness.  Even one that I could not finish.  Since my hotel had no refrigerator (but it did have a microwave weirdly enough), I could not take it \"home\" for a snack but I certainly would have had I been spending my own money and not my company's, .  While the prices here are decent, it does lean slightly towards the pricey side.  Not for downtown, necessarily, but overall.  Still, worth it.",

    "text": "The food was good and filling, but nothing that made say ooh I really loved that and I want to come here again!  The taro appetizer was nice, but I've had better fried taro  at other restaurants.  The dipping sauces were a little lacking in flavor for me.  From what I can remember, the dipping sauces were sweet and I would have preferred a savory/salty dipping sauce.  The curry with dumplings was an interesting concept.  I ended up not really liking the dumplings that much.  They were filled with some kind of mixture that I can only describe as reminiscent of tabouleh (I don't like tabouleh).  But if you are a fan, definitely go for that dish!  Again, the curry sauce was a little too sweet for my tastes.  It did have a nice spicy kick which I enjoyed.  The black/purple rice is a nice touch that makes this dish stand out from other curries you might have tried before!  I was worried about slow service, because I was heading to the opera afterwards and other reviewers said it took forever to get their food.  However, our food came out pretty quickly and we were able to eat appetizer and dinner and pay our check in less than 45 min!  I will probably eat here again, because it's healthy food that's conveniently located in downtown.  However, I'm not running back there for seconds just yet.",

    "text": "I love meat.  Beef, pork, seafood, I love it all.  That said, my appreciation for the valley's vegan and vegetarian community over the last few years in particular has grown by leaps and bounds.  The lengths to which many of these restaurants have gone to make carnivores like myself feel right at home is pretty awe-inspiring.  I'm not sure if they're all hoping to transform me into a meat-free man (not gonna happen), but if their goal is gaining acceptance as a viable and desirable option for dining out, count me as an advocate.  Such is the case with Vegan House.  An Asian restaurant serving a mostly Thai menu, but not a single animal was harmed in the making of your meal.  I was in the neighborhood for a late lunch on Friday so I decided to stop by.  Vegan House is located on Adams Street halfway between Central and 1st Avenues right in Downtown.  The interior has a pleasant mixture of wooden furniture and wooden accents inside with both table and booth seating available.  The place can seat upwards of 50, but as it was a late lunch, I was one of only a handful of customers so plenty of seating to choose from this time around.  I was greeted very warmly by the owners upon my arrival and they were over the top friendly all the way to the end.    I first received a small cup of warm vegetable soup in a miso broth.  A nice gesture and it was a nice clean soup, though honestly the broth was a little flat to me.  For my main course, I went with one of the chef specials on the menu.  The Fish Of Three Flavor had me curious from the first reading.  Tempura vegan fish and steamed veggies topped with a sweet chili sauce and served with rice.  The presentation of this dish was colorful, albeit slightly weird looking.  Came with two rather large pieces of this faux fish, and the way they were formed almost looked like someone stacked two giant pancakes on top of each other and then sliced them in half.  Fortunately, the taste wasn't nearly as peculiar as the appearance.  The tempura batter was excellent and this faux fish really did have the texture of a light flaky white fish.  I asked my chili sauce to be low on the spice scale (I'm a wimp with spice, sorry), and I really liked the mix of sweet and heat.  I poured on some of that rice a little at a time to soak up every last bit of that sauce.  For dessert, I turned to the FBI.  \"Say what?\" you ask?  That's the moniker they use for what the owner described as their most popular dessert item.  Fried banana with a side of coconut ice cream.  Four battered and fried banana slices, a big scoop of the ice cream and a few dollops of mixed berry sauce.  It wasn't too sweet, but a delicious combo and probably one of the healthier desserts I've had in awhile.  Total cost for the food, tax, and tip came to about $27.  The price point was pretty fair given the portions I was served.  Not everything I had was a home run, but everything was certainly served to me with utmost earnestness.  And every dish was a good honest effort to make every meat-free item as flavorful as possible.  Nice people, nice restaurant, good food, fair prices.  That's something carnivores and vegetarians alike all want out of their dining experience.  Props to Vegan House for continuing to expand my horizons on meat-free pleasures.",

    "text": "(Lyrics - The Animals - House Of The Rising Sun)  There is a house in Phoenix They call the Vegan House And it's been the place of many vegetarians And boy I know I'm one  I like to first start off by saying I'm not a vegetarian.  I came with a friend to try it out since he's in transition with his diet.    It was chilly Friday evening has we fought for parking in downtown Phoenix.  Vegan House is definitely Thai inspired but they also offer up some spaghetti and salad dishes.  I was debating whether to order the Clay Pot Chef's special or the Pumpkin Peanut Butter Curry.  In the end the waitress convinced me to go with the curry.  Needless to say, I love peanut butter and pondered how the pumpkin part would fit in.  However, it worked in it's own weird way.  Peanut Butter fans here's your kind of meal; creamy and sweet with a hint of pumpkin aroma and taste.  I could totally eat just the curry without the potatoes, onions, and tofu that was mixed in.    In the end, Vegan House deliveries good vegetarian food for the downtown crowd.  I'm not a fan of Veganism simply because I feel limited sometimes when it comes to selection of meals.  However, if it's your thing then Vegan House will definitely fancy you! - Enjoy!",

The salad had a soy sauce sesame type dressing that was too sweet and salty for my taste. The green curry was best part of my meal, with lots of flavor and cooked just right.

    "text": "I feel bad. I don't think I've ever written a bad review for a restaurant, especially for a vegan place, but our experience was just... terrible. My partner and I love visiting Phoenix for the excellent vegan food, but this left A LOT to be desired. Maybe we just got unlucky, but our meal was gross. We shared the tempura, which was, as expected, totally fine (because it was DEEP FRIED!). My partner ordered the pad thai with \"shrimp\" and I had the sea food soup. Both were not right. I will eat almost anything, and I couldn't stomach more than a few bites of my soup. It was gross. My partner's pad thai was not great, either; although, the noodles made it more tolerable. Service was fine, but we weren't brought drinks until we were almost done with our appetizer (and had to remind the service more than once that we were thirsty.) It wasn't busy.  There were two or three other tables at the time. I think we either got incredibly unlucky and both ordered the worst two things on the menu, or this place just isn't that good. I'm not willing to give it a second chance--there are many other wonderful places in Phoenix to eat.",

Spicy and tasty and not as oily as some Thai places. Super nice people work there as well. Great prices and portions!!! As Arnold says...\"I'll be back\" ... And he's even promoting veganism!!",
