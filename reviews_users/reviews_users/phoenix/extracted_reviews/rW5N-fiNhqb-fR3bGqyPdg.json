My review is more based on the food than the atmosphere and drinks - I would definitely go back because its a great spot but I would stick to the general bar food that you can't really muck up. I had the pulled pork sliders and the meat was bland. It was supposed to come with some cold slaw on top of them, but there were about 3 strands of slaw on each slider. My boyfriend had the reuben and said it was pretty good but I didn't try it.   Over all the place is cool and I will be back but limit myself on the food part.",

When everything seems like a pricy chain restaurants in this metro area, this is a welcome respite. True pubby atmosphere, but the menu is a total notch up. Almost a week later I am dreaming about the lamb burger sliders and the corned beef tacos. Sit back, relax, and have a pint.",

The place tends to get a little too crowded for my taste and if you're not there for happy hour, the drink prices ain't exactly cheap. On the other hand, the atmosphere is fun and lively, the service is usually friendly enough and I love the new patio. I figure if you have some cash and the right crowd you probably could do worse.......you may have to park a few blocks down the street but at least you can walk some of the booze off when you call it a night.",

I personally had to chase the first one off because he wouldn't leave us alone.  The second panhandler was very belligerent.

Service was slow at first and not too friendly when we walked in.  No big deal, we were here for a few pints of Guinness and some grub.  Our first two pints were served in not-beer-clean glasses...if you don't know what that means it probably doesn't matter to you.  The shepherds pie was mediocre.  It was beef and not lamb, the potatoes were lumpy and it was not hot at all.  I didn't finish it and instead picked at my wife's french fries soaked in malt vinegar.  Also, the waitress was trying too hard...it bugs me to be called 'guys' at a 4 star and it bugs me when I am in a divey pub and the waiter/ess puts on the snob.",

Occasionally, I'll revisit a failure JUST to see if they've cleaned up their act.  Well, with such an AWESOME first review I did on this place, I was BOUND to write a sequel. THIS, my friend, is just that.  Before I even came in here, I was DEAD set on ordering the luscious fish and chips. Now, I've spent a few nights in England (1,460 to be exact), so I feel like I know authentic Fish n chips when I taste them. Alas, my wandering eyes made me forget all about them when I saw \"Shepherd's Pie\"... I've had some PRETTY bad Shepherd's Pies in my day so I figured \"Lets give them a chance to measure up\"  Now, there is comfort food that will help you relax and take you deep away from everything stressful in your present day. Then, there is comfort food that will prop up your feet and suck on your toes while performing a deep massage just below your scapula. Rosie's Shepherd's Pie... was the latter.  I can't place the spices they used in the ground beef stew, but it was genius.  Also, the consistency was MUCH better than traditional Shepherd's Pie.  It was more of a rouge like Chili (without the chili spicing)... It had carrots that were slightly sweet and peas that popped in your mouth releasing glorious green goo to mix with the hot beef and such on its way down to your belly. \"Don't stop rubbing... keep working those toes...\"  Now we get to the potatoes on top.  They weren't overly ambitious.  By this, I mean they weren't ruined with too much garlic/butter/cream/etc... They had a GREAT natural potato taste with crispy, broiled cheese on top forming a wonderful pie crust-like seal of protection.  Except this seal was a guarantee... Guaranteeing you will stalk this dish in your dreams for the rest of your life.  Yes, I revisited the water closet. Cleaner... The service was JUST as good as before if not better! Attentive, slightly humorous, and great attitude.  I have come to decide that you can't go wrong at Rosie's... Plus free metaphorical food sex! Bonus!",

    "text": "A very good friend told me about this Irish pub not too long ago, and since then this family-operated establishment has been one of my go-to destinations for live music and Irish cuisine. The atmosphere is dim lit, bustling, and equipped with several TVs for local sports fans here and there. The decor starts with an open patio, and a horseshoe bar surrounded by a score of booths and tables. Last Friday the Sullivan's were on hand to provide the live music that rocked the house.  The Jinky's Famous Chicken Wings ($8.99) arrived with ten sizable drumettes and they were spicy delicious. The meat was a tad on the dry side, and I wished there were a number of actual wings that could appear on the plate. On the other hand, the explosive flavor was quite striking, addictive, and good to share. This is a good dish to order during game day.  Their Corned Beef and Cabbage ($11.99) came with prime pieces of corned beef, boiled cabbage, potatoes, carrots, horseradish sauce, and mustard. The thick cuts of corned beef was a tad chewy, but there was plenty of flavor to go with the creamy horseradish and pointed mustard seeds. The cabbage and potatoes were sensational. Portions were generous and good for two meals. This is one dish that I would recommend.  The Grilled Basa ($9.95) came with a strip of perfectly buttery blackened basa. The fish was tender, flavorful, and had great moisture so it was easy to fork into. This dish also came with a side of garlic mashed potatoes nicely whipped with a mix of potato skin here and there. Fia thought the fish was a tad too salty, but we both really liked the mashed potatoes.   Service was friendly, efficient, and fast. My drink was not refilled the first time, but service was much improved during my latest visit. The atmosphere really picked up once the Sullivan's came on stage. Eventually it got a bit too loud and hard to chat across the table. A cool spot to catch a game and enjoy their live music. I would be interested in coming back to try their Fish 'n Chips and Irish Whiskey Bread Pudding.",

    "text": "For an Irish pub in a not very vegan oriented area, I was pleasantly surprised to find they had a veggie burger (after some research). Unfortunately, when we got there I wanted to double check with the waitress if it was vegan a.k.a. does it have egg in the patty mix? She said she didn't know.. and stood there waiting. I guess asking the kitchen was out of the question.   I went ahead and ordered it anyway since there was nothing else I could eat, and I'm still not sure if it had egg, but I doubt it. Wishful thinking? If we do go back, I think I will call them and ask.   Their beers were typical Irish styles with not much else to boot.   On the plus side they were playing the High Kings, which made the husband and me happy, and the pub itself was easy on the eyes. I enjoyed the collage work on the walls.",

    "text": "My husband, my son, and I met some friends for dinner on Saturday, January 29th. I bought a Groupon that was two $20 Groupons each Groupon valid for one $20 visit. I guess we should have sat at separate tables because I printed out one Groupon and gave it to our friends to use on their meal.  My husband ordered the fish and chips. They don't skimp, the portions were large and fried crispy. The coleslaw was delicious. I ordered the corned beef and cabbage. It came with very tender corned beef; the cabbage was tender and the carrots and red potatoes were cooked to perfection. My son ordered the chicken quesadilla. The serving size was adequate as this was on their appetizers menu. My son enjoyed it and it came with sour cream and salsa.  The waitress was attentive and checked on us. However, when she brought my refill of ice tea she sat it in front of my friend and walked off. She also seemed to be in a hurry to remove our plates before we were finished with our food.  For a bar, their food is pretty good. I wanted to try it as my friends have been raving about it for some time.  My friends used their Groupon and paid the balance that was outstanding with a tip and left. My husband, son and I finished our meals and I brought my Groupon up on my cell phone to  give to our waitress who stated that normally the policy is only one Groupon per table can be used and the other one is for the next visit. She was gracious enough to go ahead and accept it this time, but added that this would only be for that visit. I thanked her and we paid the balance and added a tip and left. I don't believe I will be returning. I normally don't go to bars but I thought I would try it due to my friends.",

The band playing on this particular Friday night was unique: a girl with a violin, a guy with some bongos, and I believe a guy on a keyboard.   Let me tell you something. If you get a chance to go here, do yourself a favor and get the nachos. They were so incredibly good. I couldn't even tell you why, but I can tell you that my friend decided to stop eating them about half way through, and it took everything in me to put a napkin over the last 5-10 chips to stop myself from eating every last bite.

Those damn whipersnappers and their rock n roll music!  Recently, I came with dad and boyfriend for Father's Day to watch the NBA playoffs and have some beers. The family that drinks together stays together. Anyways, the staff was super accommodating about putting the game on for us even when we moved from the bar to a table. There was also a pretty good variety of beers on tap, and pints were $3.  They were currently in the process of changing chefs so they had a limited menu, but we all enjoyed our food. My quesadilla was delicious, although I guess it is hard to screw that up. My dad and boyfriend had sliders which they both loved. It was definitely a great place to hangout on a lazy weekend afternoon and watch a game. I also noticed they had a good stash of board games! Booze and board games...how can you not like that?",

Maybe in case you need to lay down somewhere after a few drinks haha!    I'm sure on a good St. Patty's day this place would totally rock and pop!  On a regular weekend night it's pretty quiet except with the live band which was playing.  They weren't too bad actually and I rather enjoyed some of the covers they played.  I was tad bit thrown off regarding the parking since it's not the best in the world, but oh well.  Funny cause it's literally next a sales lot.  There are a lot smokers on the patio and front door area, which for me doesn't feel inviting.  I hate to walk past a haze of good o nicotine for a few drinks; cause I can't get enough 2nd hand smoke on a daily basis!  I'm probably being to critical.  Sorry smokers don't mean to offend.    Overall the drinks came fast, but my Gimlet was definitely not fresh squeezed lemon and lime.  Right out of the bottle I'm sure so it was extra sweet and tangy - Zip!  In the end, I think I'll wait til St. Patty's to return if anything - Enjoy!",

Asked for the check, she gave us the check and went back to chatting up her coworker who was badmouthing their other coworkers. SO INAPPROPRIATE and a waste of an hour.

But honestly, the whiskey's cheapish, the Guinness is good, the service is suffering and the food is a True representation of UK food (bland, one note, tasteless, sugary). I spent the majority tonight with an empty glass and passed by the bartender, only to eventually have the dude serving the other side to come cover for the larger blond chick, who passed me up no less than six times, to offer me my second beer. Glossing over the molasses speed which our food order was taken, food which has become less glorious every year. My Shepard's pie tasted like cheese and mashed potatoes over a thin layer of sloppy Joe meat.   All in all...great beer, good whisky. Eh service, eat somewhere else if you're looking for quality food. Enjoy!",

Like any locally owned pub, you will experience your share of missteps if you go often enough, but there is one thing I can categorically say about Rosie McCaffrey's: I have had nothing on their menu that was bad. Not one thing. They are friendly, accommodating, clean and very, very Irish. On the weekend, don't be surprised to find a group of Irish guys at the bar tipsy and singing fight songs at 11AM. This isn't just a great local hangout, it's a great AUTHENTIC local hangout and the nationals know it and congregate there.  One thing I would like to mention. For many many years now, I've been going there for one reason and one reason alone: the wings. I'd get a craving for those wings, and I'd go there just to get them. I was not alone, a number of my friends felt the same way. The wings were extremely unique: all drumsticks, and larger than typical. In the past year, they changed their wings, which now resemble the wings that you can pretty much get anywhere - not bad, but not crave-worthy anymore. When I talked to a waitress I was unfamiliar with about this, she proceeded to inform me that I had lost my mind, that the wings have always been like this, in all the three years she had been there. Yeah, no. I have since checked with three of my frequent Rosie's companions and they all agree - the wings are not the same.  Don't let that deter you though. Rosie's is still as satisfying a local pub experience as you're likely to find in Phoenix.",

We stopped in for a drink around 6pm-ish and there were candles lit everywhere and lots of American flags hung up. They were remembering victims of 9/11 and we showed up right before the bagpipers started playing. My high school mascot was a Highlander, so bagpipers will always hold a special place in my heart. It was really moving hearing them play \"Amazing Grace\" along with a few other songs. After the music, the owner read a poem and had a moment of silence for the fallen victims. After the memorial, it was business as usual and there seemed to be a growing crowd by the time we left.   We also stopped by for a drink with an out of town friend last night. Both guys commented how cool the place is and declared their love for Irish beer. The service has been great both visits, last night I believe Rosie herself was waiting on us. I could be wrong, but with her cute accent and cheery disposition, she seemed like a 'Rosie' to me.",

It's not pieces of fish like everywhere else it's a full fillet and cooked to perfection.  My only complaint would be the service.

The traffic on Camelback was a nightmare to get there and don't even think about parking in their lot. We parked in the residential area around the corner and walked it. Much better.  The place was PACKED! We found refuge on their patio which was also the perfect place for our large party. Since its winter here, it would have been nice to have some heaters. It was BRRRRR!  The service was good. Our server made sure she grabbed everyone's order and we had a HUGE group. I got drinks from the bar and the service there is a bit slow but that is expected on a busy Friday night.  I also noticed a band setting up as we were leaving so I must return to check out some live music another time. I will post an update review of Rosie's when I go again. I didn't get the full experience in the short time I was there.",

My boyfriend and I just moved to this part of phoenix and have been pleased with the excellent selection of restaurants and shops. We were driving around this past Saturday thinking about lunch, spotted Rosie's and decided to give it a go. Upon entering we asked if we could sit outside and the less than enthused waitress stated it was open seating.  Once outside we sat at a table that appeared to have not been cleaned off in quite some time, as there were cigarette ashes and condiment stains covering the top. It was 1130am so no excuse for it to be that dirty. The girl who took our order was the same waitress we encountered at the door. No personality and not a smile to be seen.   We started with the pizza egg rolls. Interesting concept, but a little too greasy.  My boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich and I had the cold meatloaf sandwich. Both were mediocre at best. The pulled pork was dry like it had been sitting under a heat lamp. The meatloaf was bland and was covered with so many carmelized onions it looked completely unappetizing upon opening up the sandwich. All in all with the sandwiches, the appetizer and my hard cider, it came to $35, pretty steep for a lunch that was disappointing. We won't be back for food anytime soon, maybe a drink or two to check out any live music. But hopefully the next server will have some personality to spare.",

The only issue I had was as the night went on we couldn't hear ourselves talk as the music got progressively louder, but I suppose that's our own fault for going to an irish pub and sitting 10 feet from the stage..

My friends and I had the chance to meet the owners last time we ate in (we've done take out since then). Rosie and Seamus are absolutely delightful. They really appreciate their customers. Oh, and the menu is back which we are all stoked about. The wings are amazing and my husband Alex and buddy Pete really love the Irish poppers.

    "text": "Ask for a real Irish Pub in Phoenix and you might as well ask for real italian food in Phoenix. Look, it's just not going to happen. Luckily, that means that people will still try and some will come close - but who cares? Rosie McCaffrey's Irish Pub is easily one of the top three 'irish' pubs in Phoenix. However, what makes Rosie's better is that it lets go of trying to be something that it couldn't possibly achieve. That authentic irish pub, or even one close to those that you'll find in Chicago, or New York. Again, that's okay. Unlike the George & Dragon which absolutely holds onto it's attempt at being authentically british, Rosie's is closer to actually being an Irish Pub deep in the heart of desert Phoenix.   I've had many, many great nights with friends in the booths at Rosie McCaffrey's. Come with a good group of friends, when the place is packed and the band plays on the insanely small stage - and you're set for a great time. The fish and chips with vinegar are more than decent and often actually deserve whatever award they claim to have recieved. The beer flows and they have the appropriate options on draught. But none of that stuff really matters.  You can recreate the exact same bar anywhere. You can use the same wood, the same bar, have the same drinks on tap, and none of it matters if your crowd sucks. This is where Rosie's excels. The crowd. The people who frequent. Since it's deep in Phoenix, yet a little off center, Rosie's doesn't attract the annoying Tempe college crowd. It doesn't attract the annoying Scottsdale upper-class pretenders. The people who go to Rosie's actually live in Phoenix. These are hard working middle class city dwellers looking for a neighborhood bar to share a great time with friends - and drink - truly without the pretentiousness so often found everywhere else even remotely popular.  As far as irish pubs in Phoenix go, Rosie's is top three - but only because they regularly have some of the best crowds. Sure, every now and then you feel like pretending to be someone else and you make your way to Scottsdale (or you feel like pretending to be someone else everynight) but when you just want to be yourself with your friends, and have a great time, not just a good time, Rosie McCaffrey's is the place to go. So drink up, talk to everyone you want to, heck, start a brawl even, it's an irish pub right?",

My husband tried the \"award-winning\" fish and chips and said they were a 7 out of 10 and that he has had better at other Irish pubs.  The area where the bands play is pretty small and cramped, so go a bit early to get a seat at the bar or one of the tables near the stage area. It does give it the intimacy of the pubs in Ireland which is nice, but I wish it would have had a small dance floor area because some Irish tunes definitely get you up wanting to dance a jig :)",

I'm not into the night-pub scene so I can only recommend the afternoons. Been there a few times at night and I wasn't really impressed with the dinner entrees- but its a pub so no stressin. I think they have live music most nights of the week. I hear a lot of bands over the weekends for sure since I live across the street.

Also, it was evidently training day, as our service was unusually slow, according to my drinking buddies who are regulars there. So take this with a giant grain of salt...  First of all, the foam on the Guiness was thin. Inexcusable. If you're going to market yourself as an Irish pub, I expect the Guiness to be molasses thick with an impenetrable foam served just the other side of room temperature. They got the temp right, but nothing else. Also, my black and tan was thoroughly blended by the time it got to me thanks to some rough handling by the bartender/waitstaff.  The band got off on the wrong foot by asking the largest group in the bar (aka us) to move so they could set up their stage monitors. Give. Me. A. Break. You're not playing the House of Blues, there are 30 people in the bar, and you have a crappie Mackie 8-channel mixer sitting on top of the 5-string fretless bass player's amp. I think you can get by without setting up your two giant floor monitors for this gig. And spare me the crappy Johnny Rotten soundcheck, too. I get it. It's an Irish bar (Johnny Rotten was from London, not Dublin you ass) not Wembley Arena.  To make matters worse, they started off with an unspeakably lame cover of  Al Green's seminal soul masterpiece \"Let's Stay Together\" done as a solo piece by a guy who sounded like he learned to play guitar by listening to NPR.  Saving graces: Boddington's was on point. I heard one of the funniest stories I've heard in a long time from James \"Cool Whip\" H (for those of you who are interested, take me out for a drink, and I'll tell you about the \"Whip Test\"). Wings were not bad.  Probably my last time at Rosie's but I guess to be fair I should go back on a weekend or when the Fleetwood Mac cover band isn't playing, but seems unlikely at this point.",

That said, our waitress last week filled us in on the recent menu scuttlebutt. We had been told, to our great dismay, earlier this summer that a number of our favorite menu items, including the boxty, would soon be gone. However, certain chef issues have been dealt with now, and almost all of the menu will remain the same.   Good thing, too, because Hubby's beef, potato, mushroom & dark beer boxty was out of this world. My go-to dish of fish & chips was delicious as always. The hot pretzel app also hit the spot, with two great dipping sauces- the grainy mustard and the fabulous curry.   Parking is hellacious, as always, and we never go on weekends anymore, but we do love Rosie's as a weekday night dinner option. We've just learned to lower our expectations when it comes to the service. After all, they are keeping our boxtys, and well, we're simply not as interesting as the frat boys to our waitresses. We've accepted this.",

The smoking patio is far too small and seems to have some sort of gravitational pull for all the jerk-offs in the bar to congregate.  I thought they were giving away free samples of American Crew Hair Paste for men one night out there.  I was afraid to lite up for taking out 'three-stars' Rosie's.",

    "text": "The Lisbon Lions.  If you know anything about Celtic FC, then you should know about the Lisbon Lions. The year was 1967; the setting Lisbon, Portugal.  The green half of Glasgow wins the European Cup, now the Champions League.  A shining moment of glory for the Scottish club that plays second fiddle to its blue neighbor, Rangers FC; the most decorated club in the world.  And arguably the better half of Glasgow.  As of my last visit to Mrs. McCaffrey's, I did not see a photo of the storied Lisbon Lions on the wall, but perhaps I did not look hard enough.  Beer goggles are not the best detective eyewear.  Still, the atmosphere is cozy; and as for Celtic FC kit, there is enough to go around.  Beer; as a pub this is a prerequisite, and Rosie's does not disappoint.  The selection is pretty standard, but does have Hoegaarden; very nice.  The whiskey lineup is made up of the usual suspects, but when it comes to getting pissed it works like a charm.  The service is quick and friendly, so nothing to complain about there.  The victuals are quality, and if I might recommend the meatloaf sandwich.  I'm not a big supporter of meatloaf, but this particular dish was quite good.  Curry chips were excellent, although the chips could have been bigger.    So, if you like Irish pubs with a penchant for Scottish football, then Rosie McCaffrey's is the place for you.  I have a feeling that Americans don't realize that Celtic FC is a Scottish club.  Sod it, ignorance is bliss, and a place to get proper pissed should never go amiss.  It's just a shame that there are not more Scottish pubs; I would love a Rangers pub.  Maybe there is a gap in the market.  Cheers Until then, get the beers in...",

I used to work very close to here and wandered in about once a week. The food is authentic, with fish and chips and dozens of other traditional Irish comfort-food dishes.  The bar is wonderful with seating for about 20. They offer plenty of expected Irish Beer and Whiskey selections. They have a small patio for us smokers too.  Service is friendly, though it can be a little slow when they are really busy (lunch, happy hour and weekends).",

    "text": "Part of my draught cider tour.   They have the chips down to perfection. Irony that half of the English national dish is better represented here than within any of the British bars, fish and chip places in the valley.   Truth be told chicken tikka masala is closer to being the English national dish.  The only reason  Britain had an empire was to find something decent for dinner which should have left Ireland unmolested. That's a puzzle for a later talk post.:)     The queso dip to start was fine, nothing special. Why can't we have Irish bars serving something close to what I would get in Ireland?  It's a continual source of amazement to me that  it's just whatever is popular locally with the addition of an Irish name = appetizer. Que? :)   This is the best tasting non-shepherd's pie I've had. Ok it has beef , instead of lamb,  but  finally someone that didn't deaden the dish it in gravy,  waste it with poorly mixed potatoes from a packet nor stuck in vegetables that didn't belong in there.  Just the right crispiness on the top and a portion that just has me coming in as full as the last spoon is scooped.   Cider , yay,  not a lot of choice, ok no choice:)  but it's still cold and doesn't have that fell out off the can taste.    My partner had the boxty  which was feckin great to the point that I was envious, me with my pie and all, that I couldn't be eating two plates at once. Solution? I suppose I'll have to come back.",

Need I say more?! That made my night. He was celebrating his b-day with another friend of his from South Africa. I asked him what he thought of our Irish pubs here in AZ. He said it wasn't too bad & that Rosie's was pretty close to the real deal. He then proceeded to point out good whiskeys they had. If the Irish guy likes Rosie's then so do I!  This place was popping off when I showed up around 11. TONS of people. Of course they had their parking lot sectioned off too. Dear lord but there were a lot of cops around :(  The pub felt close & cozy. Service was fast. Didn't see any girls running around in ridiculously short plaid skirts like at Finnegans though.  Guinness was $6. Ugh lame! I got hooked up though. The bartender handed me a larger glass than other people's while winking at me. My new Irish drinking buddy ordered 3 Irish car bombs & if I remember correctly & it was $24.  Don't ask me what the restroom was like. I don't remember it. I'm sure it was gross by the end of the night & I had to wait in line.  This place was a hit. I'm curious to know what it's like here on a regular night.",

We left and went to TexAz Grill where they have a lunch menu and a lunch \"special\" menu. Nowhere on their menu is the word \"special\" used. I have used Entertainment, restaurant issued coupons and <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> for lunch and never been refused.

Talkative clientele, at least this visit, which is what a Pub is suppose to be, as opposed to a Sports Bar, with everyone staring at their smartphone or a TV. Although, as an aside, there was cool Rugby gear on the walls. Rugby on a TV doesn't count as a sports bar, it counts as an Irish (or maybe even Scottish) Pub!! The meatloaf sandwich (warm) was very good. Medium sized french fries with a nice crunch. My personal preference towards fries is - the skinnier, the better - but these were tasty. Irish music playing, from traditional to Dropkick Murphys and Gaelic Storm.  Also, lots of Scotch and Whiskey..",

It's typical to pay a cover charge for these events, but most places accept cash or card as payment. Not Rosie's. They didn't have an ATM near-by so they suggested walking to a nearby gas station. Anyway, cash in hand, I was not deterred. However, the bartender, a heavier set female, was extremely rude. I assume she was a bit overwhelmed and couldn't muster any semblance of customer service. No sooner than I disagreed with her she stormed off to get the third party security guard-ish from PES security. Within minutes, this less than professional individual came over and was immediately belligerent. Let me say, that I understand the need for security on a busy night when lots of people are celebrating St. Paddy's Day. However, security is suppose to prevent altercations, not start altercations. On more than one occasion this fine man said he would slap my face. He also called me some choice words. Anyway, I am not sure what the relationship of the proprietor is to PES Security, but I would re-evaluate the relationship. As a business owner I would hate to think some third rate security guard would have the ability to hurt my business when they should be making their patrons feel welcome. Same goes for the bartender.",

    "text": "\"Irish \"was the magic word for our dinner during my Phoenix stay.  Finding its signage was quite easy, but parking access may be on the contrary, depending on which side of Camelback Rd you're driving at. Upon entering is your typical divey atmosphere, obviously focused on European football & other sports of interest.  Instead of sitting at their U-shaped bar seating, Daniel L & I sat right across at the traditional seating booths, but wherever you'll like to sit, beer will (almost) always be there for you.    Based on his previous visit he recommended me restaurant items such as the Chicken Wings ($8.99), Corned Beef & Cabbage ($11.99), and Grilled Basa ($9.99), which is a type of catfish--and not surprising to discover b/c it's one of DL's favorite fishes to feast ^_^.  I've decided for us to go ahead & dive for the last 2 items mentioned, especially the cow kind b/c corned beef is also a common meat delicacy in Filipino food--which I used to eat often, yet I was nonetheless in awe to taste a European version.  Starting with the pescatarian dish, despite the missing word \"or\" between \"blackened\" & \"lemon pepper,\" DL chose the former, which ultimately turned out to be impeccably smoky without any burnt undertones.  So juicy & so downright ample, my only main concern with this filet was that, to me, it was a bit salty.  On the very bright side, & for assuaging this minor prick, I ate it with its shockingly delicious mixed veggies or its perfectly fluffy & garlicky mashed potatoes w/--or even w/o--its sensational gravy.  Now for the other entree, this came along with steamed carrots, red potatoes, & 2 favorably important sauces for the corned beef: the zesty mustard & the intensely bodacious horseradish.  I must say, all the veggies were just as consummately tasty & evenly cooked to awesomely eat together w/ thick slices of its seriously--yet stunningly--yummy cured meat (I was on vacation; deal with it).  The beef was for the most part tender, and because this & the fish dish were so plentiful that leftovers are likely gonna happen to you, fellow diner.  With DL's recommendation & a confident, yet unexpected \"Good Choice\" comment from our waitress--and now 3rd time's the charm =P--the Irish Corned Beef Cabbage should be one of your dinner delectables that you can merry yourself with some desired beer.  Other hearsay includes their Fish-&-Chips & the Irish Whiskey Bread Pudding that we will undoubtedly & brazenly order when we'll ring back to Rosie.  3.5 stars for my visit, but may luck be ever in your favor here xD!",

Great Irish knick-knacks on the walls and a good variety of Irish beers.  Passable pub food and an oft-occupied stage complete the picture.    But something about it seems lacking.

The atmosphere seemed good so we chose to stay, but she was sure we were leaving and seemed a little disappointed when we did not. She did her best to rush us through dinner the entire night. Next up was the fan above the bar that needs some grease, it squealed noisily over the music all night. The music that I could hear was not good (hip-hop/pop). Then the live band started, WHILE the overhead music AND the fan was still going... I could no longer hear the person I was talking to. We were done with dinner and it was time to go.

Its loud demeanor and often live music are great for hanging out and knocking back a few pints; several Irish draughts available.  Dining alone, with friends, or looking to make new ones, you'll feel welcomed.  One could easily take visiting parents here for dinner, or find themselves making out in the parking lot with someone they just met; few places can boast this kind of versatility.  If looking to really get into the conversation, check the band schedule on their website before committing, otherwise you could find yourself trying to carve out space on the patio to hear one another.  Quality cuisine is not lost on this midtown Celtic roadhouse; boxty, corned beef & cabbage, and shepherd's pie culture the menu, while burgers, reubens, and a BLT remain as hearty staples.  The fish & chips are worthy of the drive you might make from whatever far reaches of the valley you come.  Casual dining, happy hour, or dancing a jig into the wee hours of the night, it's obvious why Rosie McCaffrey's is the epicenter of St. Patrick's Day celebration in Phoenix Metro.",

Rosie's is pretty much right down the street from me but Monday was the first time I'd gone in for forever.   Me and a girlfriend of mine sat up at the bar as the place was in that in between time where it was just after lunch but not quite happy hour aka dead.  I ordered a black velvet with the bald bartender whose name I didn't get but who was very friendly. Unlike some of the cocktails I've ordered, it's beer and cider so it's straight forward and was delicious on that warm day.  I love all the wood and interesting details put into this place; definitely doesn't feel like it's a bar that belongs on a busy street like Camelback.   I ordered the Pastrami Reuben that they'd just added to the menu and wasn't disappointed in the slightest.  The grease eased a hang over from the night before and the meat was prepared just right.  They went easy on the 1000 Island but the pretzel bun that it came on was delicious! The fries were cooked just right.   I will definitely make it a point to return sooner as the weather is perfect right now & I love me a good Irish bar!",

Sure, getting a beer isn't as easy a normal day would be, but those bartenders busted balls to get to everyone at their bar.  They had a tent running full swing as well.  The lines were kept pretty short and I was able to keep my glass full which is what's important in life. I recommend sitting on the patio if you can swing it.  Great people watching.

After 30 minutes went by...we got to the point where we were waving our arms in the air because it appeared that none of the employees saw us. FINALLY we caught the attention of a girl with shorter black hair. We told her we had waited half an hour, and instead of replying politely she got defensive \"If you already have a beer, I assume you have been taken care of. How am I supposed to know that you wanted to order food?!\" ...hence the menus in our hands. Anyways we order and wait an additional 15-20 minutes to share a quesadilla...once it was ready she threw it on the table as well as our check and took off. I haven't received this poor of service in a long time. We left the waitress a 0.01 tip...maybe next time she will leave her attitude at home.   Adding to this!

Some of the bartenders are even Irish... or at least extremely good at faking the accent! I'm a bit disappointed in myself for waiting so long to check this place out, but I finally scored my first check in here on Saturday for the USA vs Mexico match! Walking in I was thrilled to see how rustic and authentic evertything was! Soccer and rugby jerseys, along with Jameson and Guiness signs covering the walls... I ordered a pint of guiness, a shot of bushmills, some chicken wings and felt right at home!  The food was prepared very well and did not disappoint! I didn't try any of their \"authentic\" pub food, but the food I did have hit the spot! You can basically sit anywhere and see a tv, which will come in handy later this year when the English Premier League kicks off again (GO CHELSEA)",

Aside from the Fish N' Chips, we were feeling a little decadent and ordered the french fries smothered in Mac N' Cheese, so perfect, creamy, and the fries were still crisp.  The Fish was perfectly breaded, fried and plated. We were especially impressed by the tarter sauce, it seemed to have some fresh dill added which was surprising and appreciated.   Will definitely be returning to this wonderful pub.",

But I recently moved nearby and was determined to get drunk somewhere so I took a cheap cab ride to Rosie McCaffrey's.  Given it was during the week, the bar was pretty quiet. We got there around 10 or so and wanted to sit outside but it appeared they had washed down the patio area so all the seats were soaked - a little disappointing given it was still pretty early in the evening, but we shook it off and sat at the bar. I like the decor inside. Feels very Irish-countryside and there are a lot of little trinkets and things hanging on the walls for your eyes to wander over. There was a band playing that night - a charming acoustic duo singing Mumford & Sons and other folky covers. Definitely added to the ambiance.   The bartender was okay - not incredibly friendly or fast (even though we were like 1 of 3 groups in the place that night). The cocktails were extremely weak and watery but they have a great selection of beers and from the looks of the menu a pretty good happy hour. We didn't really try the food - we only had fried munchies (onion rings, fries, and mozzarella sticks) but they were tasty. Tasted beer-battered and the breading on the mozzarella sticks was not the typical crumby breading but a thin, crispy one. A little overpriced but nothing to be sore about.  I'd give this place another shot - sounds like it'd be a whole different atmosphere on a Friday or Saturday night.",

I did not try the food--I'll write an update in a few days with that, but I had a beer and cigar and was blown away with how friendly the place is. The harried bartender actually smiled at me despite waiting on a ton of people, and while I was waiting on a beer a guy came up and started talking to me about the cigars in my front pocket. He introduced me to someone else, and before I knew it there were five of us standing out on the porch in the rain and cold weather chitchatting like we had known each other for years.   I just had a beer, but it was an Imperial Pint of Smithwicks for $4--great happy hour price. The only negative I could find was the parking. It was tight. I just happened to get lucky and there was someone pulling out as I was pulling in. But some of the regulars pointed out some street parking in case I am not as lucky next time.   Maybe I just caught them on a good night, but I will be back often if it is even half as friendly as this time. I wish I lived closer to the place. I have yet to find anyplace even close to this in Ahwatukee or Chandler. If you know of a place, PLEASE let me know.",

    "text": "Let me confess, I am a Pub Snob. Growing up in Canada in an area with heavy Scottish, Irish and British immigrant population and pair that with the fact that my husband IS British and we make a nightmare of a couple to try to impress with a \"pub\".  We tried Rosie McCaffrey's out of sheer desperation for something to eat one night as neither of us could find anything in the fridge. As we pulled into the very busy parking lot around 730 we braced ourselves to be seriously disappointed. Heading inside we were relieved to see a warm, wood paneled dining area that was slightly separated from the bar area, this helped muffled the noise from the Happy Hour crowd that was still working on their final pints.  A sweet friendly gal told us to grab a seat anywhere and she would be right back to take our drink orders. As we settled into a comfy wooden benched booth we both began to have a glimmer of hope. The draught menu contained Magners Cider which my hubby had not had since his last trip to England about 10 years ago and I settle on a bottle of local brew that was a mere $3.50! The drink specials were great and it wasn't even happy hour, and to top it off our waitress was prompt with the drinks, they were nicely chilled and she was about as sweet as pie.  The menu was another pleasant surprise, it is fairly small but with some strong dishes. If you like Boxty, they make it up fresh everyday, and the stewed item is different everyday so please check with the server. We both ordered fish and chips and we were blown away. The server presented us with a large platter of fresh cut fries and one large fillet surrounded by crisp, golden, BEER batter. Yep real beer batter, they even tell you they use Harps in the batter. The fish inside was perfectly moist, and a nice thick cut. No thin fish, fried to fish leather here! The slaw served on the side was fresh, so fresh that the cabbage crunched, no wilted, mayo slather gunk at this joint! Most importantly the tartar sauce didn't taste like bottled, it was creamy with lots of pickle and the malt vinegar was already at tableside.  For desert we tried the bread pudding with whiskey sauce. Moist and studded with plump rasins, drizzled with thick rich sauce. Absolutely delish! As we were digging into dinner, a live band started their set. The noise level was carefully controlled so that the band didn't drown out the conversations in the bar.  Overall we left stuffed and extremely happy. I can say that we found a real pub here in Phoenix!",

    "text": "Fish and chips will settle just about any dining dispute.  Don't believe me?   The next time you and your squeeze can't decide where to eat, just say \"fish and chips\" as non-chalantly as possible.   Nothing can withstand the suggestive awesomeness that is fish n' chips. Not even vegan cupcakes and soy lattes.  I wanted sushi and Misty S wanted Greek. So naturally we ended up here.  I  usually have a rule that if I'm not feeling a place within the first few minutes, I leave.   Walking in expecting shamrocks and songs with drinkable rhythms, I found a middle-age grope fest accompanied by the smooth and pedantic melodies of 3 Doors Down and some country singer who sounded like but wasn't necessarily Wifebeater McGraw. If there isn't a country singer with that name, there should be.   Needless to say, I wasn't feeling it.   But there was a feeling inside of me (hunger, perhaps) beckoning me to stay.  Waiting for our potato skins to come, I looked at my glass of water and wished I had splurged on a soda or something. It would make having to hear \"The Devil Went Down To Georgia\" and watching people older than my parents feel each other up a little more bearable.   At least there would be bubbles.  I wanted to get all indignant about the potato skins taking forever, but when I saw the hostess/waitress/bartender walking out with our skins and realizing she was the only employee on duty, I shut my mouth before I made an ass of myself.  The potato skins were amazing. They were crunchy, creamy, and smothered in corned beef, not those flavorless bacon bits you'll find at Friday's or Applebee's.   I belong at Applebee's? No dude, YOU belong at Applebee's. Because you suck.   The fish and chips were exquisite. So is the word \"exquisite\". I really need to find a way to work that more into my day to day dialog.   I've never had cod that massive before. It was big like my ego and juicy like my gossip. I know. That second one was a stretch. But seriously, it was fucking gargantuan. As I drowned it in lemon juice and malt vinegar, I shivered to think of all the lesser fish I have been duped into eating.   I was really impressed with the fries, in part because I in my endless skepticism expected steak fries, which are always soggy before you even bite into them. But not today, apparently. Instead I got hot, thick, and crispy chips.  They tasted so good that I felt bad desecrating them with the contents of a two dollar bottle of heinz ketchup left at lukewarm temperature. And not even the good pulpy kind. Seriously, does nobody serve REAL ketchup around here?  So instead I dipped them in tartar sauce. It was exquisite.  I shouldn't comment on the coleslaw, since my taste is admittedly skewed. I like mine with lots of mayo and lots of sugar. Occasionally raisins or pineapples.   But I'm sure if you did the Pepsi challenge with their 'slaw and say, KFC's 'slaw, 9 out of 10 people from third world countries would tell you that Rosie's was fresher and tastier. And that the asshole from Burger King's check still hasn't come in the mail.  I can't wait for me and Misty S to disagree on where to go out for lunch so we can come here again.",

Meaty wings, soaked in Harp, covered in sauce very similar to Franks - mmm, so tasty.  Everything else is good too, but I go back for the wings.    Irish beers on tap - Harp, Smithwick's (Shmittick's) and the obligatory Guiness - as well as a plethora of other libations.  I adore the waitress who always seems to serve us, with her m'love's and Irish mom ways.  She accidentally gave us our drink bill, without the food included.  When we pointed out the mistake, she brought back a bill sans wings.  Maybe she forgot about the wings, maybe she was repaying our honesty, but either way we tipped well and were grateful.",

I'm kind of well versed in these things.  That being said Rosie McCaffrey's gets my seal of approval.  I'm going to go with 4 stars for right now seeing as I didn't sample the food, we brought our own birthday cake in with us!  (Which they were totally cool about)  I was with the magical Bonnie G who possesses the uncanny ability to get us a table even in the most crowded of establishments.  I swear, she uses some Jedi mind tricks or something.    There we were, all cozy in a booth with a huge birthday cake having a great time....and a band starts up!  Playing Irish music!  Including a real fiddle!  I was in heaven.  I almost wanted to shout out some requests for my favorite Irish folk music (Come out Ye Black and Tans, Tri Coloured Ribbon, A Nation Once Again) but I restrained.    They have a decent beer selection, it includes the Irish beers you would expect to see but there was one glaring omission for me.  No Sam.  So boo to that.  Our waitress was really nice even though she didn't have to be at all which is always appreciated.  It was a great lively bar scene, with a nice central bar, and a warm and inviting atmosphere.  The crowd was a great range of people from all different walks of life and everyone was friendly and having a good time, most people who passed by our table wished our friend a Happy Birthday (except for one girl who was also having a birthday and we offered cake to and she ran off....who doesn't like cake?!). We exchanged a piece of cake for a rose....it was a good time indeed.  Definitely one of the better pubs I've been to in here in Arizona.  A pub like this puts a pub like the Rose and Crown to shame because R+C has no vibe.  In fact, in retrospect, R+C feels a little boring to me now.",

We were here for an early dinner on a weeknight and the place was welcoming.  There were a lot of folks coming and going; decor was homey and full of knick knacks.  Josephine was our hostess and took our orders.  We had the Giants Causeway Meatloaf and the Mac's Grilled Dublin Irish Cheddar & Tomato sandwich.  The meatloaf was paired with colcannon style mashed potatoes, which by itself is heaven on earth and real comfort food!  The meatloaf was made with ground beef, corned beef, Irish seasonings and paired with steamed veggies.  The \"grilled cheese\" sandwich was ordered by my business associate who claimed it as a favorite sandwich order with Guinness.  The menu is extensive including salads, sandwiches, appetizers.  Of course, there is corned beef and cabbage (a real fave of mine, which I've made at home) plus the award winning Harp battered fish and chips.  The next time I'm in Phoenix, I'm coming back to the pub!",

We had been there about an hour (dinner + 2 rounds) when our server came over and said, we need to give her a credit card because our tab was over $50 and we were sitting close enough to the door we could walk out on it. I looked her square in the eye and asked if she thought maybe there might be a better way to word that, like \"I'm sorry guys, I forgot to take a card to start your tab, do you think you could provide one?\" She got very defensive and started telling me how people walk out on tabs by the door, so again, why didn't you just get one to start with instead of coming to our table in a combative manner. The bar is actually pretty cool, but that little bitch sealed the deal that I will never return, nor will I recommend it to any of my friends. EVER.  We paid the tab, left a $20 tip on a $50 bill, and left.",

I went there by myself on a Wednesday night in hopes of finding some friendly folks and that is exactly what happened. I ate dinner at the bar. Marcy was the bartender and she was very friendly and helpful and she introduced me to a whole bunch of people. For dinner I had a Rueben sandwich, which was pretty large and very good. I had a a small Rosie salad as my side and it did the job. I wish it was made with lettuce other than iceburg, but the bacon & eggs & other toppings helped a whole lot. I drank a nice, cold Smithwick's from the tap. Followed that up with 2 vodka tonics and my whole tab was under $25!   The basketball game was on when I first got there. After the game, the jukebox was playing a fabulous mix of the best oldies. Around 10pm a live band played. I didn't catch much of their performance but I did notice that I really like the singer's voice and that's rare for me since I don't typically care for female vocalists.  All the people I spoke to were super nice and very welcoming. I am sure I will see a bunch (or all) of them again and I look forward to that!",

If I could pick up the whole building and move it to that triangle lot on Central & Camelback, I would.  Having a pub THIS good SO far from the LRT is hard for me to handle.    Inside, it is pretty dank.  There are tvs and crap on the walls but the ceilings are low in some places and the wood is all dark.  Pretty much everything you want in a pub.    We happened to go during the US Open Cup Final match with my Sounders playing and, without any debate, they were happy to put it on the tv.  To tell you the number of times I have fought with the waitresses at the Turf in order to get a soccer match on would mean a review twice as long as this.  In any event, soccer on the tele, big points!  I ordered the fish & chips because, well, I heard they were amazing.  Amazing? Probably not.  The fries were pretty plain but the fish was good.  The tartar sauce was pretty damn good too.  Will have to try something else next time.  The beer selection is great and they actually have a cider on tap which is unheard of here in Phx.  Our waitress was this older woman with a thick Irish accent who I would swear owns the place.  She was so sweet and totally made us love the place even more.    A great place, without a doubt.

When we walked in we were greeted warmly by a full blooded Irish woman and her charming accent was absolutely adorable.  We asked about the TV channels they had and she seated us in a booth with a view of a TV and directed us to the bartender to ask for the channels.  Unlike pretty much every other place in the valley, they actually had the soccer channel and they put it on just for us!  5 stars for having that channel.  BTW, congrats to the Seattle Sounders, the new US Open Cup Champs!  For dinner I ordered the shepherd's pie.  I've ordered that at pretty much every place that carries it, and I have to say that Rosie's has the best.  They put TONS of cheese on top and it stays nice and ooey gooey.  There was a perfect amount of mash to accompany the veggies and meat underneath.  It was really flavorful and savory.  Best of all, it was extremely comforting, exactly what I needed after a long day at work.  Bottom line, I love this place and it is now my go-to Irish restaurant.  It's only too bad that it isn't within walking distance like a couple other places.",

That's pretty damn fine, if you consider how it's been nearly 365 complete days since my first and only \"run in\" with Rosie.   All the way around, it was a nice experience. Sure, it was a Saturday night and the bar was crowded when my friend and I got there. So, we took ourselves upstairs and out onto the patio. Great vantage point, if you can tolerate smoking. I really like the interior of the place - almost feels like a basement with an escape hatch through the roof. Don't ask me why it makes me think of this. It could just be me...  I used to drive past Rosie's on a regular basis and think, \"I need to go there again.\" I never have made it back, but that isn't any fault of the establishment. Rosie's is a great pick for when you're in Central Phoenix. Definitely check it out. You'll probably leave with a great impression, like I did. Only I hope you're not as absentminded as I am to never make it back there for a second round.",

All stories I am about to relay are passed on the day after by a trustworthy \"source\" who is consistently regaled with my 3am Drunken Story Time Hour.  The roomies and I fall here \"just for one\" and consistently end up calling my boyfriend (aka \"The Source\") at half past 2 for a ride home, so it's not a crowd favorite, because he undoubtedly hates Rosie's.  OH! And there is one bartender we love in particular. After being hit on for hours by the same ridiculous wedding-ringed douchebags, one wink of the eye from Captain Awesome McBartender meant our entire tab was being taken care of by Cheaters Anon, aka those dickbags (unbeknown to said bags). It was TOTALLY AWESOME.  I also have walked in on some sex in the bathroom. Boyfriend especially enjoyed hearing me dramatize that one in great detail. I'm a hoot when I leave Rosie's, apparently.",

Great place to go and hang out with friends when you just want to chill over a beer.

Would consider this over the tilted kilt for Paddy's Day but otherwise, been there, done that at this point. Oh, and the beers were ridiculously expensive, ouch!

Pros: Good service (Bridget was very attentive), nice beer selection as one would expect from a pub like this, music was not too loud, food was filling  Cons: The food may be filling but it was also bland  There is nothing particularly bad or good about this place. I am sure if I was a heavy drinker this would be a great place to have a pint. I went there for dinner and it was mediocre. $27 for 2 people including a Strongbow Cider so not terrible price either.  It's the place you pass on Camelback Ave all the time wondering if you should go in there and have a drink, but you never do and keep driving.",

Bartenders are super nice and friendly. As far as the food goes I can't say too much, I've only ever really had the wings and they are sufficient. I mainly go for the vibe and to relax with a nice ale. Love going on Friday or Saturday nights because the bands are always top notch and everyone always seems to be having a good time.  Honestly, I've had quite a few experiences here in 6 years. Met some amazing people. Exchanged some numbers. Had deep introspective conversations with close friends and strangers. It's always been a great time and isn't that what it's all about?   I can't recommend this place enough. Give it a chance and if you're disappointed you're  probably just a sad hollow shell of a human being.",

We had the menu still sitting unopened.   She never told us about the lunch special or what was the soup of the day.  I had to ask her.  We asked her for a minute.  Hum, the minute turned into minutes & we had to flag her down.  I had the cup of soup and side salad.  The pea soup was maybe a little warm and the salad had wilted leaves I had to pull off and throw away on a napkin. I left more than half my salad on the plate.  My friend had fish and chips.   The fish was very big, but kind of mushy.  The fries were not very good at all.   An Irish pub should have excellent fries.  I tried to comment on my salad, but the waitress was not eager to listen.  She never asked us if we wanted separate checks, and we did.   She brought the combined check, never commented on the large amount of salad leaves sitting on the table and had no attention to detail.  Our experience could have been better if the waitress had some basic training.  I'll probably go back, because I am Irish and love an Irish place for lunch, but will not return if the lack of training comes out again in the service.",

I have not had any of their entrees, but their appetizers are pretty tasty. I prefer the pretzel with cheese and mustard. The mustard is face-puckering good.  The place starts getting pretty loud toward the end of happy hour, so conversation at that time is tenuous.  They have a nice patio area, both downstairs and upstairs.  The staff are usually pretty attentive, but there are exceptions.  They have free wifi, and many of the booths on the east side of the restaurant have outlets, so it's a nice coworking environment, during the day time hours.  I will return.",

The food is good and the table  height is perfect for me to type. And for some reason all that Irish music works for my Scottish/Irish background.  So what's on my mind today?   Well I have this burger every time I come here but today it was just exceptional and I just had to go on about it. And, Misty lost so much weight I didn't recognize her and she needs credit for all that work. (Yes I asked her for permission before I said that in public)  So the burger first. This is not on the menu but worth a drive across town to get. They do ribs each week and Brisket as well and those are both superb. But I usually get a burger done medium with a chili and Pepper jack cheese and sauteed vegetables and no bun. It is too good to even describe adequately. The meat has flavor on its own but the combination makes me want to put it on the floor and roll in it. Add a Guinness beer and just forget it, you are now a regular here.  And then there is Misty the waitress (Wednesday and Friday I think). The bartender and some other waiters are very good  but Misty was always the crown jewel in coming here. And then I was gone for awhile, and when I came back, Holy cow she was a whole different person. I carefully asked \"Did something change with you?\" And she said \"Well yes, I lost the equivalent of a whole person.\" On top of being a professional and working so hard she did that.   So do yourself a big lunch favor some day.  Go to Rosies and consider my burger or something else and get to know the bar tender and Misty.",

We sit outside most nights, but there is usually live music indoors on the weekends and the upstairs area is nice as well.",

She was awesome and so much fun.  We were there for about an hour before this guy came in am sat next to me.  I could tell he was distressed after doing several shots in a row.  I asked what was wrong (my mistake) and he started crying and telling me about his ex who he dated for 3 weeks back in October (6 months ago).  Anyway, long story short, this guy tried to get me into a \"verbal headlock\" at which point I said, \"stop right there, this sounds really important, I'll be right back\".  Well, I didn't make it back and we were off to the next stop.  I got a little offtrack there, but this place is cool and I recommend it for good drinks at reasonable prices!  Check it out!",

We usually come here Friday afterwork to help us transition from the work week to the personal weekend.  It helps us keep work life out of our personal lives.    Every-time the server was super delightful and friendly and the service was always excellent.  The place is always clean and very very inviting.  The loo is always quite clean, so it helps reassure me that their kitchen is well kept too.    Whenever I come I always order the same thing, their shepherds pie.  It is absolutely amazing and would recommend it if you're into mashed potato and meats.  My coworker would always order the spinach dip thing and fries and whatever alcohol he felt.   Overall a good place.  Never had a bad time here!",

    "text": "A few months ago there was a Facebook conversation about traditional Irish breakfasts and the lack of them in Phoenix. One of the folks in the conversation seemed to remember they were served here and she called and confirmed there is indeed brunch served from 11-2 on the weekends, even though the brunch menu is not on the website, and one of the items was the traditional Irish breakfast. We all said sounds good and nobody touched the subject for several months. It finally came up again and 3 of us made plans to go. 11 is already lunch time for me so I had the fish and chips while the other 2 had the Irish breakfast. At this point we found out they were short one item for the dish so they offered to sub extra of one of the other items. This was just after we had found out my beer of choice was out. My fish itself was good, the batter was too hard too cut with a fork on the bed of fries so the filet became finger food. The fries were good. Portions were good all around. The service was mostly good. I would probably come back again if somebody wanted to meet there.",

In the menu it says it comes \"in a pie shell topped with puff pastry served with mashed potatoes.\" Instead it comes covered with mashed potatoes like Shepherds Pie would with a puff pastry on top of that. When I asked for a replacement I was told that was how it comes and the puff pastry was the pie crust. I quickly showed them their own menu and quoted it word for word. They quickly changed tune and agreed to take it back but my only recourse was to order something else. I won't come back for the food or the service...  I'm not sure why the item exists on the menu if they can't serve it as described. My only guess is they're hoping that during the long wait for food you forget what you ordered and will eat anything that isn't moving off the plate... But I digress. I also ordered the artichoke spinach dip. That's supposed to have green chilies in it, but I believe that was the most bland tasting thing I've had in a bar in years. Seriously, they didn't even add salt for flavor. I'm not sure if this is how the kitchen usually is but I'm unimpressed.",

Rosie's can definitely be a fun bar, but we were in a melancholy mood, and I distinctly remember the bartender was so respectful in those moments. For that, I must cheers Rosie's.

What I can't understand here (or at most businesses on Yelp) is how almost all the one and two star reviews are from people who have written only 1-5 total reviews. Now, I do understand that every reviewer has to have one review to get started, but when these are months or years old with no more review activity, I wonder if they are really legitimate. That being said, if you look at people with many reviews, you will find a better accuracy of the establishments. The same holds True here where you will find friendly service, prompt service (varying, of course on how busy they are), and excellent food served hot and beer served cold. Overall, a truly enjoyable experience.",

I have a seat and giggle to myself about two flagpoles positioned directly in front of the TV with the game on.  I decide I don't care enough about that game anyway and i'll just focus on lunch.  The waitress and bartender were both friendly and greeted me on the way in.  A menu was provided quickly and drink order taken.  The tables are VERY sticky.  Sticky as in they have been sticky for so long no amount of scrubbing will get that sort of sticky out.  Anyway, I decide to order the sampler appetizer. Wings, onion rings, cheesy sticks and eggrolls to name a few.  It's a good size platter for about $14. A fair price for sure.  In less than 10 minutes the food is at my table.  This is great except three of the six items on my plate are barely warm.  Barely.  Like, how does a food order in an empty restaurant arrive not hot out of the kitchen? I take one bite of two different items before feeling the rest with my hand and calling the waitress over.  I explain half my plate is not hot.  She apologizes and brings it back to the kitchen.  Immediately comes back to my table to explain someone is training in the kitchen and the chef was not here however the chef did JUST arrive.  She apologizes and I say I understand and thank you.  In literally less than 3 minutes she returned with the exact same tray including the two items that I had taken a bite from.  Everything is now hot which is fine but the only way this could happen if if they simply threw the food in the microwave and sent it back out.  She comes back and asks if everything is ok.  I say \"did they literally just toss this in the microwave and bring it right back out, because how else would all of this have been made in a couple minutes, the items I tasted are still on this place and now the texture is rubbery\"  She apologized and said she didn't know what they did.  She asked if I would like them to make me another appetizer platter.  I told her no thanks, i'm good.  I say \"Thank you for trying but I don't have all day for them to get pub food right\".  I I'm just going to leave, no need in playing this back and forth game and i'm not here to make a scene. I wished them a good day and left.  Pretty sad that I was the only customer getting food at that point and two trips to the kitchen and all they did was microwave my food.  Gross.  I know better than to expect a good meal on the third time sending it back to a kitchen.  I'll stick to Rula Bula or hell even Seamus downtown before I return to Rosie's.",

    "text": "I always hate giving bad reviews, but our service left quite a bit to be desired. I can normally dismiss such things, but it became evident that our bad service was not a fluke.  We arrived around 10:00 and was told that food would only be served until 11. That wouldn't be a problem at all except that our waitress didn't return with menus until close to 10:30 and then returned to take our orders at only a few minutes before 11. The place had other patrons, but it certainly wasn't so busy as to take an hour to get our orders. Unfortunately, on each of our visits, the waitress was half listening and seemed easily confused  The food itself was quite good. The Shepherd's pie was hot and tasty and the bloody marys were actually perfectly spiced. Neither was worth getting excited about, but they were certainly decent and reasonably priced.   Considerably later in the evening, our waitress returned with the bill. There was one extra drink on the bill which no one ordered and she was perfectly friendly about saying she'd remove it, but we spent a good five minutes as she kept getting confused about our - apparently - very complicated instructions of \"$20 on the credit card. The rest in cash\" She continually read back excessively complex scenarios, and we kept asking her simply to put twenty on the card, that's all.  When she returned, she had taken $20 of our cash towards the bill, charged $60 to the card and kept the remaining $55 in cash as a tip. That's just shy of a 75% tip she assigned herself.   We spoke to the manager, who couldn't find her for some time, and when she showed up, she blamed us repeatedly. She finally refunded the card and brought us our new bill, with the extra drink.  It wasn't worth arguing about at that point.  The sad part is that everyone at my table, and our surrounding tables started telling similar tales from past visits. I guess this kind of service is not uncommon.",

    "text": "My husband and I dined here this evening at about 7:30 for dinner. I had high hopes for this place. It looks fun from the outside. I was impressed when I read somewhere that Mr McCaffrey introduced Guinness to Phoenix. Since the owners are from Ireland, I was anticipating an authentic Irish experience here.  Well, our first impression was, shall I say, odd. We walked in the main entrance and were greeted by...nobody. The place looked empty at first, and we wondered if we had come through the wrong door. We walked around trying to figure out where we were supposed to be, got funny looks from people at the bar, then returned from whence we came, only to discover a small sign instructing us to seat ourselves. Whoops!  We chose a booth and wondered how anyone would know we were there. After a bit (maybe 5 minutes?) a very nice waitress greeted us saying \"I didn't see you guys all the way over here!\" She took our drink order (water - we're easy to please in that regard) and swiftly returned with our beverages. The swiftness did not continue, however.  We probably sat there about 15 or 20 minutes waiting to give our waitress our orders. Mind you, the HUGE place was near empty. When she finally returned to us, she asked us if we were okay, and apologized, saying she had forgotten about us.  The ambiance was nice and Irish-like. However, I will say that I wished they had chosen Irish music to play over the stereo, rather than assorted genres of 90s American music. Weird.  Now onto the food. They didn't seem to have much on the menu that seemed very authentically Irish. Maybe the Irish don't have much variety in their food? At any rate, I had the corned beef and cabbage, and my other half had the shepherd's pie. Both were good, but not as good as I had hoped for. Fresh ingredients would have made a big difference. Also, it was disappointing that there was ground beef, not sheep, in the shepherd's pie.  Overall, this place was just okay, and we both agreed that we wouldn't desire to return there.",

They dump these frozen crappy things into a fryer and serve it up with good ole' ranch to cover the taste. Do I now have to ask specifically about everything on every menu to make sure I'm not getting ripped off - apparently yes. The menu description says potatoes and green chiles and other spices rolled together, etc. How hard is it to take some of your fresh mashed stuff, roll it up , etc and deep fry it? Nah, these guys aren't interested in serving quality food, so we get a cowdung sized pellet filled with fake potatoes and having no taste. Pathetic.    Happy Hour drinks are a joke as well. They were only $2.75 for well drinks, but the 2 drinks I had and the 2 drinks she had were all water, no booze.  Plus, the blonde bartender had no clue how to change the TV stations.

The first time we thought the atmosphere was terrible but the food (fish) was OK  There were only a few people there - a couple of cronies of the bartenders at the bar and a couple of other people besides us.  Last week we went a second time since we still had the Groupon.  (Otherwise we would not have gone back.)  It was horrible!  The food was barely edible - lukewarm corned beef, dry meatloaf, lumpy mashed potatoes, bitter vegetables, etc.  Even worse than the food was the BLARING Irish music.  There were a few more people this time - probably about 15 people in all.  The decor is old and tacky and the ladies bathroom smelled like a sewer.  UGH!  Save your money and go somewhere else.",

I really hope that is not the best Phoenix has to offer, otherwise I will forego this meal until I can get out of town.  We had the \"famous\" fish and chips last night and it was \"TERRIBLE\".  First the breading was so tough that it almost needed a knife to cut through it.  The fish itself, OMG, it had been frozen so long that it quickly turned mushy in our mouths. Never, never again.  The rest of the meal was fine.  We had no complaints with the coleslaw, french fries, or tartar sauce.  It was also nice that they provided malt vinegar. I just hope some of their other food is better, as Rosie's is a good representation of an Irish Pub.",

It does draw in huge groups of guys. They do have a great beer and liquor selection. But it's pricey as hell. The bartenders are mostly friendly and attentive.  The parking lot here is a mess. Take the number of patrons inside and multiply it by 1.4, and that's the number of cars. It might be easier to park on 8th Place as it gets packed. They have a few TV's but they're riddled with static. How is it a place like this charges five bucks for a fucking beer but can't fix their satellite, or just get Cox cable? I know it's not a sports bar, but it's typically so boring that the TV thing becomes important.  I'd say skip this place and check out the Vig, Shadys, Sanctum, HB Hanrattys, Pomeroys or any of the places on 16th Street. Hell, even hit up a gay bar. You'll save yourself money and have a much better chance of seeing a woman.",

There's nothing wrong they said. Still won't open.   Okay now my review.  The place used to be a happening place. Any day of the week it would be busy and the food outstanding. Now the place is like a morgue. There's hardly any one there. The music is still good, but the food has gone downhill.  It isn't the quality I've come to expect from Rosie's. I drink a beer they don't have on tap and it comes in a bottle. It is not as cold as I like it and I'm no longer offered a chilled glass. Wait staff is still friendly but Rosie's has just gone way down hill. On a Saturday night when we stopped by it was empty. Wait staff playing around lip syncing and dancing to the bar music because there were only three other people in the place besides us. What in the world has happened to one of my favorite places?",

I went to the toilet and witnessed a Patron violently vomiting his guts up in the stall and screaming bloody murder as he did it. I went and told a bartender / member of staff that he probably should be removed.  To my disgust I see a server / bar-back guy  go get the fella who was vomiting and escort his back to his seat at the bar to continue drinking while he was clearly hammered and could barely walk.  Absolutely disgusting. Tabbed our and left straight away and I'm guessing the toilet was painted with his insides.  Neither bartender seemed to care that he was a full blown disgrace at 9pm on a Friday .",

Need a refill and the bartender has a friend show up?    Ha Ha Ha.  Too bad. 10 minutes after setting the empty pints on the bar's  edge, looking around, trying to wave her down and not once - never did the bartender look up, check the folks at the bar, or stop talking and visiting with her friend long enough to make her rounds. (2 customers got up and went to the restroom and returned and not a once did she or anyone bother to check us at the bar - any of us at the bar).  Then I made the mistake (I take part of the blame) for ordering food that was not fresh cooked.  My husband ordered fish and chips (you have to make that fresh) and they came out fresh and crisy. He was quite happy with the fish. The chips were warm(ish) and not crispy.  I stupidly ordered Shepard's pie. It was cold. Not quite ice crystals but just at the frozen stage when it came out.    Remember the bartender and her friend?  Another 10 minutes - 15 minutes(?) before I catch the eye of another server by standing on the barstool cross pieces and waving and calling out before she comes over.   I tell her it's cold. She says we'll heat that up. 10 minutes go by. I wave and call out again if there is any chance of getting my food?  She disappears into the kitchen.  Comes back to tell me they are making me a new one.  My husband (by this time) is 3/4 of the way done with his food. I have not had anything. And yes of course I can here to sit and watch someone eat and not eat with them. Isn't that what everyone does?  So the server who actually came over to \"fix\" the food issue goes outside. I assume on a break or to smoke or something.  10 minutes goes by.  She finally comes in and heads straight into the kitchen. I said to my husband \"my foods probably been sitting there the entire time\".  She comes out carrying food for me.  It is the same plate, the same food, the same everything I sent back (except the bread on the side is hard as a rock from going through the salamander again)  but now it has a pound of cheese melted on top.  It is barely warm. I get it to go and 60+ dollar later we've had beer, 1 meal, a crappy time and I am at the either cry or yell stage. Now I remember why we do not go here anymore.  You want an Irish pub with good food and SERVICE?  Go to Tim Finnegans.",

Funny thing is that the rules say you may not have your cell phone in hand before your team turns in each answer as if text message previews don't exist. lol One particular team did not eat or drink throughout the entire game and yet interestingly, at least one person in said group still needed to use the restroom AFTER each question was read and it was time to discuss. Pretty hilarious! What adults feel the need to be Trivia Night champions sooo badly that someone is sent to the restroom each time to text the correct answers over??  Honestly really sad and awkward but something we were all able to laugh about afterwards. Otherwise it was a really great time, most people in attendance seemed to be enjoying themselves, our food was tasty and servers were nice! Overall a fun evening and we will be back!",

The decor alone is worth a visit as the bar is a True Irish pub bar.   Seamus (I believe the owner)... on this particular stop was watching a futbol game when we arrived. He let us know he was open but not serving booze yet, but that he was making a exception for us. Made us feel even more welcomed.   I opted for a bloody mary instead of my go to Guinness and was presently surprised as he made it with Clamato juice. Hit the spot.

I did not eat last night; rather, I imbibed quite liberally. Three Guinnesses and two Irish Car Bombs later, I was pleasantly relaxed and had to kick it. I was glad I hadn't driven because parking is at a premium. That and the whole drinking and driving thing is so 1988. Buzzed walking is tubular!",

(thats complimentary.)  She was genuine, kind, and was one of a kind.    I ended up ordering the tuna melt, and could not decide what kind of bread to get.  I asked our server, and she had suggested sourdough, because she said that I would get a bigger sandwich.  Sold!  I enjoyed this place, even though it has more of a bar feel.  its reasonably easy to spot from the road, and our service was excellent.  I would gladly return for lunch or dinner to this place.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is becuase  the interior is somewhat dark, and its more of a bar feel then a resturant feel.  I would see myself going here for a night out for drinks, but the food here was good, and service made it even better.",

Sometimes beer just isn't cold enough in freakin', steamin' hot Arizona and you just NEED a beverage with ice cubes.   I ended up getting a \"irish\" drink, beer on tap... but I still NEEDED ice cubes. ICE- water please? Waitress was very reluctant to provide delicious ICE water it seemed.... But to give her the benefit of the doubt, it was Friday during happy hour and I was there with a group of about twelve and you don't get tipped much for serving water.  BUT parking is also a mess (besides the lack of mojitos and margs).  Their dinky lil parking lot fills up super quick and thirsty patrons are left to their own devices to find parking on neighborhood side streets that won't tow their car. I was fortunate to find parking close by :)  I did like this place because its a great place to socialize with friends... hopefully everyone in the group is kosher with drinking beer.",

    "text": "Sadly enough, Rosie McCaffrey's is like my Cheers --- not because it's so great, but because I can walk there, they know what my drink is, I can get schnookered and follow the breadcrumbs back to my house.  Come to think of it though, there are people there who resemble Norm, Sam and Woody.  The crowd is all over the map depending on the day of week.  A friend of mine sardonically describes it as a straight version of Padlock --which if you know what that means then great.  But if not, it's better that way -- trust me.  Let's just say it can be a bit of a meet market.   Weekends are crowded and tend to attract a fun upper-20s, early-30s party-hearty crowd -- the Tempe crowd 7 years later, I suppose.  It attracts more of a mainstream crowd than say George and Dragon.   Bands perform on the weekends.  But to be honest I can't even tell you what kind of music or what they sing.  They have a lot of beers on tap (Harp, Guinness and such) and strong liquor pours.  Tom is a rockin bartender. Weekdays are more laidback with a steady happy hour clientele of alcoholics, business crowd, Central Phoenix locals, Irish expatriates and rugby people. The jukebox is OK, but there are better jukeboxes in the area.  The feel inside is your standard Irish chotchky clutter, but it feels like an actual old house with the whole upper level.    Oh yes, and the pub grub is pretty good.  The fish and chips here are deserving of their reputation.  Great batter. The hot wings are also a good choice -- lots of meat and tasty Harp-soaked sauce. Stay away from the club sandwich -- the bread is soggy and the American cheese kind of ruins it.   BTW, St. Patty's day is CRAZY here. Yeah there are Irish pubs everywhere, but this is the only Irish pub for miles around -- so the crowd here was huge and spilled into the parking lot.",

Unfortunately, I was drastically disappointed.  The service was absolutely terrible.   The question of \"What do you have on tap?\" should not be a difficult one to answer.  Our server didnt feel like answering and instead pointed to the menus with attitude as if we were making her night miserable.   Strike One.  Our group quickly turned from 4 to 8.  When we turned to our server to assist us in relocating to a larger table, she told us we could look around if we wanted to, but she didnt think it was possible to accomodate a party of 8.  We asked about the upstairs and she told us there was a private party and no room.   A friend of mine went up anyways, to see a perfectly open table with 8 lovely chairs.  He asked the private party, which was paying the check and getting ready to leave, if they minded we sit at the other table.  Of course, they didnt care at all and we moved ourselves. Strike Two.  Despite the bad attitude and completely unaccomodating service, we managed to rack up quite a bill between all of us.  I waited tables for four years and consider it a given with such a large party and hefty bill to offer separate checks.  Before we could even ask, the SINGLE check was dropped with 18% Gratuity added to it.        Stike Three.  The food was average at best.  I've had better Potato Skins at TGI Fridays.  Its a shame, because this place is a $5 cab ride from my home and I really wanted to like it.    I will make the drive to Rula Bula over this place any day.",

Anyplace that can do that gets 4 stars from me as long as everything else is above average. It is... although, to be fair, the parking here looks like it could definitely pose a challenge at a \"busier than Sunday afternoon\" time. The service was very attentive and the food was good. I've never had corned beef on potato skins before, but now I'm wondering why everyplace doesn't do that. It's way better than bacon and provides that meaty, saltiness that skins need to survive the entire gathering. These didn't need to be dipped in sour cream and drowned in beer just to swallow the typical leathery dryness they usually take on after sitting a few minutes. YAY! The chicken tenders were almost too thick with breading, but the tasty fries made up for this shortcoming.  The local Hefe was good (albeit served with a lemon wedge and not the \"politically correct\" orange slice) and the \"made from scratch\" Marg's were decently stiff. Whenever I'm back in the neighborhood, it's good to know I have a new favorite.",

Megan is my favorite. always a huge smile.  in the past I've walked out of here with a $300 tab. today, I'm happy to pay under $20. i would rather save my money for better bars.  2 stars for the change i don't prefer, 4 stars for Megan!!!  I'll meet half way and give it a 3.",

    "text": "This update is not because I went back to Rosie's, but to share the comment I received from my server. I really think it's in poor taste she felt the need to contact me and makes me NEVER want to give business to Rosie's ever again. In my review I relayed the events as they happened, I'm not going to sugar coat it. I still think the cost of my friends drinks should not have been charged to me and it's not that my friends are \"unreliable dining compainions\", it was not their fault their drinks were not charged to them and they didn't notice. The server is the one who rang up the order and made the mistake, she should own up to it, not blame my friends or get pissy with me. It's really too bad that I don't want to give my business to Rosie's because I really do like it there and I really wasn't that upset with the server, just the situation. I still stand by the fact the drinks wrongfully charged to me should not have been my responsiblity. Doesn't matter if the drinks belonged to my friends, I shouldn't have had to pay for the mistake the server made.   Here is her comment: I was your server that evening and do not appreciate that you feel servers should have to pay out of our own pockets for your friends mistakes.  We seperate checks to make things more convienent for you.  Most places do not allow split checks.  I am sorry your friends skipped out on their portion of the tab.  Maybe you should find more reliable dining companions. As for the one beer on your tab, that indeed was my mistake and if my memory serves me correctly, i quickly and kindly apologized for MY mistake and swiftly removed it from your tab without any friction. Can't wait to see you again soon.  Rosie's always tries to give a good experience to it's customers.",

Plenty of people drinking light fizzy yellow beer with megadeath music playing loud overhead, and several video game machines that take quarters on the bar itself.  Sure, there's a few Irish sayings on the wall and they serve Guinness (though ours wasn't in the Guinness glasses that most Irish pubs seem to have).  Glasses weren't especially clean either as we could smell a cleaning chemical like aroma in the beer glass.  Parking was nearly full on a rainy Monday night so I fear what it would be on the weekend.  Doesn't have the same Irish vibe over at Seamus McCaffrey's.",

After dinne we got our drink on with a live band. The waitress was helpful in getting us drunk off a variety of liquors. And the shots kept on coming! It was a blast. The second time was more laid back, just grabbing a beer with a girlfriend. It was a Tuesday and the place was pretty busy. The next time me and the girlfriend showed up completely wasted and they had an Irish band playing. It was a perfect way to end our night after clubbing at the gay bar! We had a baileys nightcap and everything went dark from there. Awesome night!",

Last time I was in, about a week ago, there was a fight on the entrance patio. Intense. One guy got a broken nose, the other a bloody leg from a bottle cut.

    "text": "Oh boy was I excited when I first walked into Rosie McCaffrey's.  An Irish pub right down the street?  This place was a godsend disguised as a local drunken hotspot.  Apparently, it wasn't disguised at all.  It really is just a local drunken hotspot.  I've been a moderate patron of Rosies for the past few months now, and while this is my usual watering hole of choice, there are a few things that need to be said about it.  First of all, the beer selection is good.  It isn't Yardhouse by a longshot, but the choices are varied for different tastes and income brackets.  The food is good for bar fare.  I felt much like a Irish local grazing the fields of greasy confections, I could literally feel my alcohol tolerance increasing with each bite.  The service is good, but prepare to wait if the place fills up (which it does) and you'll get looked over if you don't have cleavage (which I don't) but it helps if you're on a first name basis with the staff (which I am).  The music is varied, which is nice.  On the nights where live music is playing, you'll get a spattering of Irish folk music or recent covers.  I'm a fan of a few bands that play there, but to be completely honest, there have only been a few occasions where I've found my toes tapping.  But it's lively and fun, pleasant to listen to while you inebriate yourself.  You'll find a wide range of characters that frequent Rosies, though.  From the bar rats, greased woman hunters, drunken floozies, haughty better-than-alls and down home boys, there is never a lack of people to talk to.  I can't guarantee a good experience, but who can?  But I wouldn't worry, if you're using the place as you should, you won't remember tomorrow morning anyway.  No matter it's flaws, Rosie McCaffery's is worth a visit at least.  Grab a bite, take a shot of Irish courage and mix it up with a stranger.  If you see a fellow standing to the side, people watching with a silent amused smirk, come and say hello.  I probably won't bite.",

Next time I'll see about ordering some traditional Irish fare and make a real assessment. Yes, I'll be back. But I'm not making any other excuses for y'all, dammit.",

    "text": "Definitely a LEGIT trush irish pub. Been to that bar a few times and everytime I had nothing negative to say about Rosie's. Really great selection of draft beers which is  always a plus in any bar I plan on visiting. My only issue is being a west valley guy, it can be a little bit of a drive to the central phoenix area. My advice for anyone coming the west valley or anywhere else were this could be a little out of their way, defintely designate a DD!  So my first experience of Rosie's came from a  very good friend told me about this Irish pub not too long ago, and since then this family-operated establishment has been one of my new favorite bars. The atmosphere is dim lit, not too loud, and equipped with several TVs for anyone that wants to watch a european soccer game.   I spent the last St. Patrick's day @ Rosie's and had a blast!!!! Cover charge was no shocker, but still reasonable, and absolutely justifiable if you have ever been there before. Every corner of the whole place was filled with live music, great people, and of course good irish whiskey! Both indoor and outdoor bands were playing all types of music. I reccomend anyone in the area to visit Rosie McCaffrey's, but just be on the lookout that parking cansometimes be a pain, so keep an eye out for a n empty spot!",

A friend of ours insisted we had to go for the fish and chips: place was pretty empty when we arrived, and we were told to seat ourselves. The appetizers were pretty good- pizza mozzarella sticks.   I don't like fried fish, so I had a chicken sandwich, which had mayo. My husband had the fried fish, as well as coleslaw(made with mayo), which no one else in our party ate. 2-4 hours later, we both started feeling quite ill- agonizingly painful stomach cramps, nausea, and several other symptoms I won't go into here. The symptoms lasted for 4 days. Bottom line, avoid anything with mayo.  We certainly will not return.",

My \"McCaffrey's Burger\" was super dry and super salty. I asked for a \"medium\" and got a \"well done\", almost burnt burger. I definitely expected more being that the burger cost $14! My friend got the \"Margarita Flatbread\", but that came out about 10-15 min after everyone got their food, it was obvious that our sever forgot to ring in the item. When it finally came out it wasn't a flatbread at all, but a 12\" pizza (a pizza that really only had sauce on it with circles of cheese and looked like a 5 year old made it). Was planning on spending St. Patty's Day here, but I'll start looking for alternatives now.",

A band called the Sea Merchants was playing some great rowdy Irish music so we took a seat at the bar. Service was prompt and the selection of craft beers was very good. We had only planned on staying for one (yeah right) but we met some friendly patrons on the patio and as a result stayed much longer than anticipated. The patio is not fancy and faces Camelback Road. The interior feels very Irish Pub like to me. Most impressive was the ambiance and the friendliness in the place. It seems like a great neighborhood bar. Wish it was in my neighborhood! In any case, I will be stopping in again whether the DBacks lose or not.",

Bed of both worlds!  My daughter did not care for her mac and cheese so they sweetly offered to to substitute for something else.  I did not know this at the time but I ended up having to pay for the more expensive plate instead of her meal?  Really? Hmmm  Well, very tasty overall and they threw in my son's birthday dessert so that was kind. Average value with good flavors and service was excellent!

I enjoy the decor of the restaurant although it is a bit dark. They just updated their new menu. Their old menu was still online. I noticed that they increased pricing and they also made their menu a bit more generic and less Irish-style cuisine.  After placing our order, we proceeded to wait over 30 minutes which was unacceptable.  The server was kind enough to change the TV programming for us but waiting over 30 minutes with kids doesn't work. My kids ordered the mac and cheese from the kids menu and the meal for $6 was not a good value. It tasted fine but my 11 year old son proceeded to polish it off in 2 minutes. And he's a small kid! I order the strawberry and spinach salad.  This was pretty decent salad although for $11, it was a pretty small salad.    I liked the idea of having a pub lunch at an Irish restaurant but I'm afraid there are better choices that offer authentic and better food, a livelier setting, and more reasonable pricing. Kind of disappointing since it is a convenient location.",

We ended up going up to the top level, didn't know but we crashed a private party, but everyone was very cool and ended up having good conversation with total strangers.

    "text": "My last visit to RM was one of the most unpleasant experiences I've had at a local venue. I brought a group of friends from out of town to grab some drinks.   We were greeted at the front door by an odor that smelled like raw sewage. To get away from it we migrated to the stage-end of the bar which was empty but the live music was obnoxiously loud.   So we continued to the unheated patio area where we were immediately greeted by two local transients who asked us for cigarettes. We don't smoke and told them so. We grabbed a table and were happy to be seated and clear of the hazards.   Right then an RM staff member entered the patio area and politely asked the transient fellows to move on. They came to an agreement that if he provided them both with cigarettes, they would leave. Guess who the Staff member came over to ask? Seriously. We said no again.  A waiter then came out and took drink orders but informed our 23 year-old Chinese friend in a very cold and apathetic tone that she would not be able to order alcoholic beverages at RM since they would not, out of preference, recognize either of her 2 forms of identification from China.   Our friend was confused since she had ordered drinks at several venues in town before without issue. There was no explanation provided. We apologized to our friend and ensured her that this is not how most venues in the United States treat visitors.   About 10 minutes after drinks were served we were asked to leave the pub since it was 10 pm and our 23 year-old friend could not prove she was 21. She apologized to the group emphatically for causing a scene. We felt horribly for her and for the fact that our waiter took and placed our orders minutes before she knew we would be asked to leave.",

I noticed they do Groupon now. Good time to check it out. We had corned beef n cabbage and of course, their FREAKING HOT WINGS. I had forgotten just how hot they are. The average hot wing eater should choose medium. They are supposedly marinated in Guinness. I don't know about that. But the hot sauce is thick and flavorful, really dark and hot. Perfect thing to burn your face off with after you get tanked on beer. I have had Shepherds Pie here, sandwiches, never anything that wasn't good. I noticed they were understaffed last week.  So services was so-so. But they have a solid staff that hasn't changed much in years and people are always having fun at the large horseshoe shaped bar. I have had a few interesting times here, usually something weird going on around you to listen in on. If that's your thing. I have never gotten out cheap but never broke either, I wish I still lived close by so I could go more often. Used to be my weekly run, not so now.",

They used to have live music on the weekends (not sure about now) and it was a fantastic time for St. Paddy's day every year with lines down the street so get there early.  Seating can be a bit cramped when they are super busy, but I love the look and feel of the establishment. Its a staple in Phoenix and a \"must visit\" in my opinion.",

    "text": "Rosie McCaffrey's  The short: The best no-frills bar food I've had in a long time in a dim, but clean and cheery pub environment with decent service--a good addition to a list of dependable, casual standbys.   The long:  Rosie's located on the north side of Camelback and it really sticks out because it looks like a cute, two-story Irish pub dropped down between a couple of car dealerships. Every time we drive by on a weekend night, the place is lit up and packed to the gills with a line of cars waiting to get in to park, so I can attest from that that parking is a stinker during prime pub hours. We went on a Saturday afternoon, though, for lunch, and parking in their lot on the west side of the building was a breeze. The pub theme carried through inside, even more so, with dark-stained wood booths and trim everywhere. There were a couple of handfuls of patrons starting their bar tabs early, and as we progressed through our meal, more people came in to eat and drink. It was nice how all the wood sucked up the sound, so while the place filled up slowly but steadily, it never got very noise. The walls are covered with really cool art, including giant portraits depicting Irish heroes and influences like James Joyce.   We snuck in through the west entrance and were at first confused as to where and how to get a table, but after we flagged down some help, we were told to sit anywhere and were brought a couple of menus after a short wait. We gave a drink order, and it took another short wait before someone came to take our food order. After that, service rolled along pretty well--our glasses were kept full and empty dishes were quickly picked up and taken away.   We started with Rosie's chili con queso dip--queso with beef brisket, rotel tomatoes, chilies, and tortilla chip. The dip was brought in a little cauldron surrounded by tri-color chips. Some were stale, but most of them were fine. The dip started off a little runny and seemed to be all liquid cheese, but we could taste the yummy brisket, and after awhile, we found the few precious, tender meat chunks that were in there. All in all, it was pretty tasty, even if it wasn't uniform.   My boyfriend had Rosie's Reuben with fries. The Reuben came with sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and Thousand Island dressing. I was jealous when I tried it. I love a good Reuben, and Rosie's Reuben is solid--grilled-crisp bread, tender and succulent flavorful corned beef, not overdressed, gooey cheese that doesn't take over--so good. I had \"Our Famous Best of Phoenix Harp Battered Fish-N-Chips,\" which came with coleslaw, sweet potato fries, and tartar sauce. I saw several awards Rosie's had won from rags like the New Times, so I figured I should go with those blaring recommendations. I'm happy I did! The fish was crunchy, but not overbattered and had a clean taste. Both the sweet potato fries and regular fries were great--they came crispy and stayed crispy through the whole meal.",

Well, in the hopes that others do as I do (by reading review), I'd skip this establishment.    I ordered the fish and chips, which is the house special.  When I see \"house special\" I figure they've got to do that one right.    Nope.  I kept thinking of Robert from the TV show Restaurant Impossible, and how he'd feel eating mushy fish in a greasy batter covered coating, laying on top of soggy fries.  In addition, I can't think of how anyone can mess up coleslaw.  Well, with limp greens sitting in day old (or older) sauce, that's how.  Washing it down with a pint of beer was the best I could do.  My recommendation is to continue searching for another venue on Yelp.",

We always noticed from the outside it looks super busy so thought it might be a really cool place to hang and get some good drinks and food...   We decided to go on a Friday evening around 7pm.  We were super hungry and thought we need to finally go here.   We after fighting with traffic and trying to find a parking spot for a good half hour finally stepped foot into the place.  Right away the place was packed as soon as we walked in.  No wait service noticed we looked lost and attempted to help us find a spot to sit.  We roamed around for another good 15 minutes and decided to skip this place.   Finally when we were walking out the door someone noticed us and said they have room upstairs to sit.  By this time we were hungry and said that sounds good.  She escorts us up stairs and it's a tiny little empty space with two people up there.   All the action was downstairs and I felt really cut off from the whole vibe of the place being upstairs, the waitress took our drink orders then we waited, and waited.  It had to have been over 20 minutes before we got our beer.  During that time we looked over the menu and noticed it didn't have many choices. Not feeling impressed by this place, I didn't want to order a meal and have to wait another half hour or longer for food.   We took off.   I won't return, not worth the time it takes to #1 deal with the traffic, #2 find parking, #3 find a spot to sit and order, #4 get placed in the kiddy room on the second floor, oh and I didn't mention #5 horrible early 80's rock----(I like some 80\"s rock, but this was the bad stuff)",

Their menus are essentially the same with Rosie being a little more Americanized and Seamus more Irish.  Rosie's claim to fame in my book is that they have Magner's on draft.  It's like Strongbow, but drier so it has less of a sweet bite.  The food here is pretty decent, but I usually come here for beers (or ciders, in my case) and food is an afterthought.  Happy Hour goes from 4 to 7 and you get a dollar off beers and 2 bucks off appetizers.  A pretty good deal.",
