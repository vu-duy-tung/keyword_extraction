I have been there a few times for some beer and chit-chat, and my favorite thing about this place is the energy that lights the place up.  It just has a \"fun place\" feel to it, and that opinion was shared by a couple of people I had met there now and then for some pints.  If a loud pub is not your style, this won't be either, but otherwise it's definitely worth a try.",

The rain drove us to wait it out at George & Dragon's.  Unfortunately the staff were not prepared for the amount of customers that would hid from the rain that day.  As I could see there was one bartender and one waitress.  We couldn't get a drink or even order food.  After patiently waiting for 20 minutes we left this establishment and headed to another local pub.  I've heard so many great things about this place but this day I left very disappointed.",

So I could go on and on but the point of my review is to brag on the service. The staff had their jobs cut out for them that day! GD must have had close to 400 people packed inside, way over fire code- shhh it was a very special occasion. Of course service was a bit halted as you could barely move, but she kept the beers coming and everyone was happy.   Also I was pleasantly surprised because I enjoyed the English Breakfast more than I thought I would. Seriously, it is worth trying.   Thanks for the service on quite a spirited day!",

This place reminded me of what it was like in England and I loved it. The first couple of years my problem with going was the smoke but after Phoenix (& AZ) went smokefree the restaurant cleaned up quickly.   The left side is all pool tables and darts. My best friend and I spent many nights with a beer and a game of darts here. The right side is a restaurant section where you can sit down to have a great dinner. This section is large enough to easily accommodate a group dinner as we did often.  The beers here are great and the variety is exceptional. For the food, I always get the same exact thing. Shepherd Pie is my favorite, and I have seriously never had better (even in the UK). It's perfect with cheese & HP sauce. You just can't get any better than George & Dragon on Central.",

The place is not real 'hip' I would say, but everyone seemed to be having fun. They had tvs playing the basketball game and the place was pretty busy at around 8:30 when we went there. We ordered a couple beers (I got a Hef and he got a black velvet I think.... cider and Guinness) and we ordered a shepherd's pie and some fries. The beers were good and the food was really tasty. It was exactly what I wanted but didn't know I wanted. The shepherd's pie is really mashed potato -y and the meat is really tasty.... very flavorful. The pie is huge too so I wouldn't think twice about sharing it. After that he got a jameson and ginger ale and I got a couple shots- a buttery nipple (the best shot) and an orgasm shot (ok... not as good as the other). The BF's drink was huge... like a pint of whiskey. Anyway, the night was good, I like the atmosphere (they also have pool and darts and all kinds of stuff to do) and the drinks were nice too, our total was around 50$ after tip so not too bad for the amount of stuff we got. I would definitely go back in the future.",

Next time I would like to sit int he main part where all the noise and decor is really happening.    I had the Cornish Pastie - \"puff pastry stuffed with ground beef, vegetables, served with  mashed potatoes, peas and gravy.\"  And he had the Shepherd's Pie - \"marinated lean ground beef, mashed potatoes, sharp cheddar and gravy upon request.\"  Both were delicious!  The food was definitely the hard core return factor for us.  The staff seemed friendly enough and our waitress took care of everything in an efficient manner - she had a group that went from about 8 people to roughly 20 people in the corner booth over the ~45 min. we were there so she got a tad tied up towards the end with accommodating their orders.    Overall: B+ Sit in the main part of the restaurant - be ready for a bit of loud music / noise.  Enjoy the decor and eat some good pub food.",

On the menu the shepherds pie was listed at $10.99 along with a full description: marinated  lean ground beef, mashed potatoes, Sharp cheddar and gravy on request. Pretty simple one would think.   When the bill came I noticed that the shepherds pie was charged at $12. So I asked the waitress. Her response was \"well you ordered cheese and gravy and that's a dollar extra\".  I asked to see the menu again and pointed out that on the menu it's shows that this is part of the dish and says nothing about cheese and gravy being extra. In essence it was part of the meal.  She wouldn't budge I asked to see the manager.  After about 10 minutes of hearing \"we can't find the manager\" or \"the managers not here.\"  A guy comes up and says \"can I help you?\"  I explain the entire situation one more time.   He pulls the menu out, reads it, and then states \"no cheese and gravy or extra it says it right here.\" I asked him to please show me where on the menu it said it.  He looks at it again thinking, furling his eyebrow and says well !I guess I can see how somebody would get that confused.\"  Clearly the menu did not state that. Unlike the cheeseburger where it clearly states cheese extra onions are extra. I commented that his menu was misleading and he's taking advantage of people. He reached in his pocket, Took out a dollar and slammed it on the table. He walked away no apology no \"thank you for your business.\"    I would suggest if you're not familiar with this business or it's business practices, you watch your bill very carefully.  the food wasn't bad, the service was so-so, but the management stinks!",

If you are planning to watch the straight outta Compton film coming aka, you are looking for a crowd with some color to their faces, I wouldn't recommend this bar. But its pretty clean, server make sure you are attended and they also seem to have a talent of knowing when your empty without hoovering so cool place. Strictly a drink review (after 11pm) , don't know if their food is worthy love.  Side notes - who messages on Yelp, read the review move on.",

I had to get home.. darn you Sheriff Joe, so I sampled the local water. ;)  This has a great laid back vibe and it very unpretentious.  The outdoor patio seems fantastic as well, although the misters were so hard core, there were puddles.  Apparantly there is kick butt trivia on Thursdays that we plan to attend.

We saw, we drank, we ate mediocre food and crossed it off our places to go again. After touching and looking at the super greasy menu, I decided what I wanted to try then went to wash my hands. Granted, this place is not high class, but holy S@&$ the bathroom was disgusting! No lock on the stall and when I went to flush, a spider ran over the top of the tank and dropped onto the handle.. So.... I did not flush for fear of the spider.. Yuck!! So on to the food.. Reuben sandwich.. Hardly any meat, soggy bread and quite a small sandwich accompanied by a huge pile of grease laden fries.. The fried fish was described to me by my dinner guest as being way over cooked, grease laden and difficult to eat. Yet he did not want  to complain while there which prompted me to write this. Bottom line - your servers are really great and you are damn lucky for that! They are your first and last impression of your business. Your food is not worth the price and your restaurant is grossly dirty, but your staff rocks!! You better keep them happy!!",

I've noticed there are always people out front on the porch (so it seems petty popular.)  My 90 year old grandma was visiting around Christmas and we stopped in for lunch one day.  This was intentional since she is from England and I wanted to take her to an \"authentic British pub\" to see what she thought.  She absolutely loved the fish and chips and I had the BLT which was awesome - curly bacon is the best!  We both enjoyed it a lot and Gram said the decor reminded her of the pubs in England.  A few days later we decided to go back for the roast dinner on Sunday and everything was great.  The server was very nice and attentive, everyone enjoyed their meals.  I would also recommend George & Dragon to watch sports as they have a huge screen (and several other TVs) to watch the game on.  We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "For my 200th review...a place, that if it had not had such wonderful natural defenses, there may have been no reviews...  The George & Dragon (\"G&D\") earns its 5-star rating from: great barkeeps, quality pool tables, damn good fish and chips (and other grub), great atmosphere, good patrons, and sturdy walls.  Yes...I said sturdy walls.  Time: Friday, February 21, 2001.... 9:59:45 through 9:59:55 pm MST.  Event: The Great Guinness Toast of 2001 for the world record....at exactly 10 pm.  The reader's digest version:  Co-workers and I agree to celebrate HH at the G&D and stay 'till the Guinness toast.  We stake our claim on the first booth on the left as you enter.  In fact our party ebbs and flows over the course of the night and we take up much more than the booth and gobble up surrounding tables and standing room only floor space.  As the time to toast nears the G&D becomes packed to the gills.  Standing room only.  Loud as fuck.  Impossible to move.  There is a MC of sorts in the back keeping the crowd on task and announcing random countdown times...and starts the actual countdown at 30 seconds.  The entire bar has Guinnesses in their hands.    \"20...19...18...17...\" What was an already packed entrance (merely two feet away from my right) becomes ultra packed by a sudden rush of people falling forward like at a concert when the band shows up.  \"16...15...\" Screams...lots of them...and an even more frantic push in the doors and next to me.  It is so loud everywhere else the MC takes this for enthusiasm.  \"14...\" *Very loud crash* more screams...people literally climbing over people to get into bar...this is all just feet away from me.  MC hears this and assumes crowd really getting into it.  \"13...12...11...10...\" All the new people in bar look terrified and confusion reigns.  \"9...8...7...6...5...\" More screams and a second crash just feet away from me into bench outside booth.  MC continues completely oblivious...in fact maybe 80% of bar is oblivious.  \"......1! Cheers!\" Everyone, even all the people still picking themselves up off floor by the entrance, and all those who were once screaming bloody murder, and everyone surrounding the immediate scene, as well as yours truly, raise their pint and yell, \"Cheers!\"  Turns out, unbeknownst to me at the time, a patron was kicked out about 5pm earlier in the day.  He knew about the Guinness Toast at 10 pm.  So he proceeded to wait across the street in his truck, get more liquored up, and drives his truck into the G&D exactly at 10 pm as fast as he could get his truck going before the collision.  Luckily for many, including myself, he hit the pillar just to the left of the front door.  He proceeded to back up and try ramming the window outside my booth but only got minimal speed and was foiled by the bench.  He ran...and got caught.  So..G&D..gets 5-stars for having great natural defenses and good sturdy walls...I may not be here today if it hadn't.",

    "text": "I've always wanted to try this place after I heard their weird radio commercials a few years back.  It always cracked me up whenever the guy talked about the bangers and mash.  We finally stopped by one day after a lovely little trip on the lightrail.  The entrance is a little confusing being on the south side of the building.  I guess this is because I am used to entrances being in the fronts of buildings as opposed to on the side.  When you walk in, you see everything you expect.  A couple pool tables, dingy floors, a seedy looking bar, and tables and chairs scattered about.  There are a decent amount of booths as well.  One thing that I noticed and considered a bit odd was the fact that a third of the restaurant seemed to be sort of partitioned off for the \"fancy\" dining area.  I don't know if that is the case, but it definitely looked that way.  When it comes down to it, this place is a classically tacky pub type restaurant, and I like it.  Unfortunately, the food is not so great.  Neither is the bitchy service you get when you come in.  A half smile would be a welcome gesture instead of a perfect view of my server skulking in the kitchen.  I'm not sure what was up with that.  Maybe PMS.  The husband ordered the bangers and mash and I got the cornish pastie.  The husband mentioned that he had to add a lot of salt to his gravy, but he seemed to enjoy his meal.  Me on the other hand, not so much.  My gigantic pile of peas that kept rolling of my plate were cold and had a few hairs in them.  They definitely weren't mine, I checked.  The pastie was delicious, and I really liked it, but the accompanying mashed potatoes were too thick and lumpy to be any good.  This place just isn't good enough.  Hair in food is just plain gross.  Mediocre food combined with rude service is not going to get me to come back.  Besides, I am sick and tired of hearing the owner of this place bitch and moan about the lightrail being a detriment to his business.  I don't know how you can say that when the place is packed on a Sunday afternoon with no sporting events going on.",

    "text": "The first time my boyfriend and I ate here, it was during the early evening, and very crowded - which we thought was a good sign. It took at least 15 minutes to be waited on, as waitresses passed our table many times before asking us if we wanted a drink. It took another 15 minutes to get said drink. We ordered food when our drinks came so that we wouldn't have to wait, but it was another 30 minutes before dinner came. We both ordered a 'pastie' dish - mine was chicken and it was delicious!! The best I've ever had, with a light pastry crust, filled with veggies and chicken, and a delicious gravy. The mashed potatoes were great too, with a chunky chicken gravy. I took more than half home because it was a lot of food. My boyfriend had the beef pastie dish, and his was just as delicious. He cleaned his plate.  Our second visit was a complete disappointment. (There were three of us). I think the reason we didn't notice the overall appearance and condition of the restaurant the first time we went was because it was evening, and the place was dark and somewhat crowded. This time, when we walked in, we were hit with a strong dingy, musty smell. I wanted to turn around and walk out right then, but we had been driving a while and were all very hungry, so we decided to stay.   It was mid to late afternoon, and the place was nearly empty. We were seated at a booth in a corner. The booth was nasty - the chair covers had holes in them, the table top was dirty... the whole place was dirty - the floors, counters, everything. It made me cringe. Again, I wanted to leave, but the guys were so hungry, they wanted to eat. The place was not busy at all, but the waitress that sat us, did not come back to our booth for at least 15 minutes. It took anther 25 minutes just to get drinks. The servers hung around the bar, not attending to the few patrons in the place. I couldn't find the dish I wanted on the menu, and when the waitress finally came back to our table, I asked her about it. She said they no longer had it, and the chef who worked at that time was no longer there. I was disappointed. I asked if there was anything comparable to it. She pointed out a vegetable pastie dish on the menu, so I decided to try it.   Our orders took forever to come. We finished our drinks and were not attended to for another 30 minutes when the guys meals came. Mine was still being made. My boyfriend ordered the fish and chips. They were extremely dry, mostly batter with barely any fish in them. He pointed it out to the waitress, but she didn't apologize or offer to replace the order. The french fries were dark brown - an indication that the oil was old and needed to be replaced.  My son had a cheese burger that was overcooked, dry and bland. His french fries were also brown and unappetizing. My order came out about 15 minutes later, and when I cut into the pastry, the vegetables were mushy and unrecognizable. I tasted it anyway. It was bland and mushy, no taste of seasonings or salt, disgusting. If there were vegetables in it, they were so overcooked, they were complete mush. I sent the dish back. The waitress came back, saying she showed it to the manager (or owner?), and that he said \"That isn't how it's supposed to be made.\" She then asked if she could have the chef make another. Seriously?? I declined. I wanted to walk out right then, but the guys were real hungry and decided to finish eating, even though they weren't happy with their meals at all. At the end of the meal, the waitress brought our tab and my dish was on it. Of course, I had her take it off the ticket. We left disappointed, and I was still hungry.  To sum it up:  Very dirty, dingy, and smelly. Poor, slow service. Terrible food.   Anyone who says this place has the 'best' food in town, or that they have the 'best fish and chips' - either has NO taste buds, or are friends with the owner. They would be doing a better service to be honest and get him to make the changes necessary to turn the restaurant/bar into a place people want to come back to. If changes aren't made, I expect this restaurant to go belly up in the very near future. It might behoove the owner to call in 'Restaurant Impossible\" or simply shut the place down.",

So I wanted to give my 100th review to a place so deserving of recognition.  I've been to G&D dozens of times in the past 8 years, and I can honestly say that I've never had a bad meal or bad service.  As a vegetarian, my favorite meal was always the Cornish Pasty. Mmm. Just thinking about it makes my mouth salivate.  A beautifully flaky pastry filled with potatoes and vegetables.  And peas, I love peas.  So yummy, I can't really remember many other meals there, although I do remember having a very good roast beef recently.  The booths are awesome. The owner is incredibly British, and it shows.  There is a ton of authentic paraphernalia decorating these walls.  Plenty of British ales as well.  It's the standard to which I compare all British pubs in the valley.",

The 'chap told tales of cold brews and homemade English cuisine which sparked my curiosity and my thirst, so I headed on down the 51 for some suds and spuds.  Amazing pub feel with authentic techniques made the overall experience rather impressive, even more impressive was the Shepherds Pie  with brown gravy, that made my mouth scream for seconds.   It lost a star because of the somewhat questionable parking lot which made me feel kinda uncomfortable during the walk out, but perhaps maybe that's just my snot side speaking.",

Besides their beer selection putting a twinkle in my eye and the menu making my heart stop. I find it endearing to post up and get crunk on the patio overlooking Central Ave.  I took a first date here, she enjoyed herself and I got a goodnight kiss that night. He shoots, he scores! Maybe it was just the booze talking.  Nevertheless, it's definitely my default. Since its within walking distance, \"G&D\" is sent in a mass text message on any of the 6 nights I drink.",

Oddly they serve a chicken satay in some sort of peanut saucy fabulousness that is pretty damn amazing. The pool tables suck, but hey, I suck at pool, we're even. Where else can you get hammered for 20.00 while wearing pajama bottoms and not feel the least bit out of place.  If you can get past the creepers that haven't been laid in centuries and the distinct feeling that one or more of the waitstaff has probably been smoking meth all day I suggest you check it out. Just make sure you bring an escort ladies.",

We walked in, went directly to the bar and stood there to wait for the bartender to take our order. Two staff members saw us standing at the bar, and neither person acknowledged we were even there. It would have been a totally different experience had someone at least greeted us and let us know it would just be a minute. Unfortunately, that didn't happen and we ended up leaving. I realize it may have been an isolated incident, but I am pretty sure I won't be going back; there are plenty of other places to get a drink in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Been going to G&D ever since moving here to Phoenix a little over 3yrs ago.  My first experience at the place was a few weeks after moving.  It was the middle of August and the AC and all refrigeration at the place had gone out.  Despite the rising heat in the place the bartenders were still moving quickly behind the bar and trying to make the most of the situation for the customers.  They let people know the situation and were knocking down prices as beers started to get a lil warm before things got fixed later on in the early evenning.  I noticed that lots of people still stuck around even with it getting pretty warm inside.  That to me meant on a regular day this was a good spot.  Ever since that first time and thinking there was a reason people stuck around, my thoughts have been proved right each time I go.  I have never had a bad time when I go into G&D.  The food is great, especially with the newer menu and cooking staff.  I have yet to have a bad item when I order food.  Most recently had the Turkey Club and it was a huge sandwich and very good.  The wings are always great and the potato soup on Thursdays is a good eat during Trivia.  Yeah, I said it, soup in AZ.  Staff has always been great.  Like the servers at any and all restaurants, there are good servers and ok servers.  At G&D it is no different but here the OK servers are better than most you will find at other small pubs and bars.  When it gets overly busy orders can run slow but that should be expected during a huge rush.  Over all I have found that the staff is great and if you go there to enjoy yourself and treat them well, they return the favor.  I have been going to the G&D long enough that I have gotten to know most of the staff and have not had a bad experience with any of them.  I am a big fan of this place and try to make it there once a weekend.  I rarely miss a Trivia night on Thursdays.  Highly recommend hitting up the G&D, one of the better spots I have found here in Phoenix.",

    "text": "4240. Easy address to find. Plenty of parking in the rear. Street-facing patio for those who want to poke their heads outside, or for those who need their nic fix.   No noticeable \"Entrance,\" though the \"Exit\" Is marked (I guess that's the more important sign to have up, anyway, in case the party inside gets too fun.)  (NOTE: \"Main Entrance\" is on the south side of the building. Once you walk in, the bathrooms are on your left - pool tables on your right. So much safer than walking into a game of darts!)  We walked in through the Exit... and just about took a dart to the temple. Quick, duck!   There were patrons playing darts, chattin' at tables, standing at the bar... It was filled without being packed. Open seats at the bar beckoned to us, so who were we to ignore the call? I took my seat and ordered a Guinness. Service was fast and attentive. My 2nd round came right as I finished my first.   This place is cool, although on the night I went (my first night, for the record) I noticed there was plenty of men, but only a few females. This bodes well if you're looking to get hit on, I thought... Of course, what happens when I just want to chill out with a drink? Guess we'll see next time.   In any case, with my friend in tow and conversation free flowing, I had a great time. Bonus - this place is within stumbling distance from my new abode. Nice!   So, naturally, the night I'm saddled up to the bar and enjoying my Irish beer and the happy buzz that it gives me, I notice something peculiar. Never mind the mix of people -- from artistic smarts to tat canvases to baseball fans. Instead, I noticed the female bartenders cleaning up the bar with aggressive impatience... almost like slapping their rags on the bar top was the clear call to clear out. What time was it? I checked my phone. 12:18, precisely. Even bars in Oklahoma stay open later than that. I looked at my comrade in puzzlement. What gives?   I guess we were being told that closing was coming soon, and our patronage with on a deadline. Well then. I savored the last gulps of my Guinness and we left... long before last call, I'm certain of it. But I didn't want to stick around to find out.   4 stars - based on a first experience. I say that's pretty damn good. I'll definitely be back. (NOTE: I went back...the next night! And I had just as great - if not a better - time at G&D. Bonus! I heard real British accents!)",

    "text": "Located in the holy bermuda triangle of awesomeness and light rail construction of central Phoenix, I had to try this place out. Wednesdays apparently they host a mod/soul dance night. Since I had to be around the Indian School 'hood anyway, I figured-this is the time. Well, this must be one hell of a popular night to go-I had trouble finding parking in their huge lot! Only when I saw a group of young male hipsters go to their car around 11:30 did I score a spot...the farthest spot away from the pub!  I entered the side door, I was greeted by pool tables and went straight to the bar. Lots of random guys at the bar and fabulously mod, blackhaired ladies smoking were gathered around but managed to get a stool and just got an Amstel light on the tip their other beers were price-y. I looked around, seeing the DJ spinning some James Brown with an old American Bandstand playing on the TV above him. Some ladies in A-line dresses and guys were R&Bing their way while holding lit cigarettes. A small dance floor for maybe 20 people, the rest were holding court at large booths, round tables and standing around in the back-pretty much a full house. I also spotted near the pool tables DARTS. And while they have the shitty electronic ones, I did spot an AUTHENTIC old-skool one wedged inbetween-I def. have to bring my dart set next time!  The crowd was friendly and guys from other dance nights I attend were there and we struck up an easy-going conversation-hard to hear sometimes since right next to the \"dance floor\". I don't think there is much going on Wednesday nights-this is apprently \"it\". Some guys left to do Casey Moores, but since the dance floor wasn't packed and the other tables were filled, I just left after one beer. I have no idea what this place is like other nights, but the bartenders were friendly and the general vibe of this place is laid-back but not cheezy.",

    "text": "Expensive drinks and poor service but ample parking and a large venue. Karaoke on Monday nights though the wait is long and the host isn't great. The food is adequate but nothing special, hardly what I'd consider authentic English food. They have a smoking patio with both heaters and misters for those hot summer nights but the place gets quite busy.   Prior to their remodel they were an absolute mess. I've had friends who recieved their cooked food still wrapped in plastic, and numerous friends complain that waitresses added higher tips for themselves or tacked on more to their bills than what they had ordered. When brought to the owner's attention it was disputed and basically told, \"well you were drinking, you probably just didn't realize how many drinks you ordered\"..when there was only one drink bought and an entree. One waitress even altered the tip line from $5 to $25, this being the same occasion that the food was still wrapped in plastic!  I hope that there service in that regard has changed but I wouldn't know as I haven't bought food there since that occasion.   It is a fun venue, they have a poker league as well as the aforementioned karaoke, it does get very busy and there are very few servers so getting service takes awhile, even when ordering at the bar. Its a good place to bring a large group early on so you can stake out a table, or bring friends and family during the day when its much less busy. Despite my dislike, I always know I'll be back to GnD.",

The cook is gentle with eggs and makes an outstanding biscuit. Even the Southwestern breakfast burrito is really good, and that's hardly a native British dish.  Weekday lunch also weighs on the positive side, though again, you'll probably have to hogwrestle your server to get an actual lunch menu with the discounted burger (which is a good burger for $5-ish but not for higher prices).  Once you're into the main menu... I rotate among the English Dip, the roast beef dinner, and the fish 'n' chips, all of which are on the up side of decent. There is beer. There is a fruit crumble with custard that is excellent.  Service varies wildly. I've had excellent, prompt service at the right level of attentiveness. I've waited so long for a menu that I gave up and left. Today's adventures included the server forgetting to put my order in, then not checking on me for 40 minutes, at which point she was a tad snippy that I was seemingly lingering over my beer for so long. She acted like she was doing me a huge favor to actually put my order in when I pointed out that she hadn't -- which, I guess, given the spotty track record of service at this restaurant, maybe she was.  Bar Rescue replaced the tatty, comfortable booths with relatively uncomfortable tall bar tables (probably from some trendier restaurant that went belly up in the Great Recession), shortened the menu, raised the prices, and made no noticeable changes to the quality of the food or service.",

    "text": "We were looking for a casual place to go last night, after the game got let out.  Everything around the stadium was packed, so a friend recommended that we come here.  I was born in the U.K. (I've lived in the US for 29 years), so I'm always happy to go to an English pub for some grub!  I knew exactly what I'd get, because I always get chips & curry sauce whenever I go to an English pub, especially if it's the first time going to a new place.  I was really shocked to not see chip's & curry sauce on their menu but I saw that chip's came with several of their entrees, so I figured that I could get a side of chips.  Our server (American Gal) comes up to our table and I asked her, do you not serve chips & curry?  She said well I can do a side of chip's and a side of curry.  I asked her, do you have actual chip shop curry sauce...I got a very puzzled look from her.  The Mgr (American Guy) then comes to the table with a sample of their curry \"sauce\"...he brings me a sample of their actual Indian curry.  I said never mind, I was looking for chips & curry sauce.  He then proceeds to be extremely rude and starts telling me about how they're all different types of curry from all of the different regions of India and that the sample he brought me, is the curry that his cook (from India) makes.    I was really shocked that a Mgr of an English Pub literally had no idea what chip shop curry sauce is...I had to explain that there was nothing Indian about it!  I mean, it's like managing an American restaurant in another country and not knowing what ranch is.  In a very nice way I told him to look it up that night, just so he knew what I was talking about.  If I wouldn't have been beyond hungry, I would have left at that point as he had a horrible attitude.  I can't imagine that he's the owner and hopefully if the owner here is British, they can explain to their Mgr what curry sauce is!  From looking on Yelp, I see that there's an Irish place in Phoenix called Rosie McCaffreys and they have chips & curry sauce on their menu.  I've never been there to try it, but I'm guessing that this would be his chance to check it out and then maybe he'll feel bad (and silly) for how rude that he was to me.  Anyway, let's get past the curry sauce.  We ordered the fish & chips, the fish was good and the chips were \"proper\" chips, not fries.  It drives me crazy when restaurants list fish & chips on their menu, and they bring out fish & fries. The batter on the fish could be fluffier, but you still always get better fish & chips from a British Pub, than any high end restaurants that attempts to make it!  Our server was great and I'm glad that she brought out salt & vinegar before our food arrived.  The food was also piping hot, which every Brit appreciates!  The actual environment was not that nice but I can understand that as after all, it's a British Pub!  I was thinking that it needed a little bit of a remodel, so I'm surprised to read on Yelp about how they've just remodeled it.  The place has character though with lots of British flare, a menu with all of the main British entrees, lots of British beers & ciders and they even serve up a Sunday roast dinner.  They have lots of TV's, so this will be a great spot to watch the World Cup games next year.  They also have some events that take place in the week, with specials on their food.  If I take the rude Mgr out of last nights experience here, I'll give this place 3 stars.  It does need a bit of an upgrade, but the food was good, service was not bad (like a lot of the reviews say it is) and the place has character.  Seeing that I've just moved to AZ from CA, I'm happy to have found a British pub.",

Although the dough was flavorful and cooked well, the inside filling seemed a little cold. The Toffee Pudding however I can not say enough about - it was absolutely incredible! It was a toffee cake surrounded by a moat of toffee sauce. Very delectable! The prices were decent, and service was attentive. There's also ample of parking in the back which in downtown Phoenix is excellent!",

The prices is always right and they are open everyday until 2am.   Even the food there is really good for being a dive bar.  The reason beyond coming for years is because the bartenders actually care about you and hangout for a couple of minutes before they go to the next person that wants a drink.  Well, also they are close to my house.",

Howerver, I have a image in my mind of what a pub in the UK might look like and George and Dragon made that image a reality.  George and Dragon is unpolished, and unpretentious.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and welcoming.  As I  sat muling over the menu I enjoyed listening to the random music being played.  In the short time I was at George and Dragon I  listened to  metal, George Michael, Aretha Franklin, classical and everything in between.   The customer service at George and Dragon in amazing.  The servers  were very accommodating without being intrusive. Our server took the time to explain the menu and even offered suggestions based on our preferences.  Moving onto the food.  The food at George and Dragon is great and served piping hot (which I truly enjoy).  The unique combinations of flavors were prepared and presented perfectly.  My lunch party and I tried Bangers & Mash, Roasted Vegetable Pastie, fish& chip, Shepherd Pie, and Meatloaf. All of the entrees were delicious.   Even though we were full from lunch because at George and Dragon the servings are large. We had to try dessert. So we ordered blackberry crumble and  bread pudding.  I have to say the bread pudding  was the best I have ever had.  We will definitely be making this place a regular stop.",

We grabbed one of the large half circle booths near the windows.  A waitress came over, took our drink orders and told us about what was good. Now Ive heard the Fish & Chips was the best in town.  So after looking at the menu, my girlfriend and I both got that.  Im a huge fish & chips fan...  So I will try any and all of them. Plus being Friday, they are usually all-you-can-eat.    Our meals came out and I was ready to dig in.  It smelled delicious.  When I took a bite, I noticed that it was crunchier than i usually like.  Almost too crunchy. I asked for a couple sides of sauce to dip it in.  Seems I used up both sides pretty quickly.    Ok, the fish was good.. but it didnt blow my mind and it wasnt the best.  So far my favorite Fish & Chips is Fox & Hound over on Bell Rd & 83rd.  Still G&D is a great place! .. I will order something different next time.",

I think the owner (dressed nicely) even brought it to my table which shows they go the Xtra mile. The waitress was right there for me several times! She was on point.

With that being said both times I have been here were for Trivia night (Thursday 9pm). The owner is a very funny guy and he runs the trivia process. The food is average and they do have a very cool cheese burger that has a ton of melted delicious cheese. The only reason this place did not get 4 stars from me is because the bathrooms look like something out of the movie Saw. My advice is: stay for the trivia and if you have to go, hold it.",

    "text": "I've been popping into the George and Dragon nearly every Thursday since last April for trivia nights.  I like the place.  The trivia host is entertaining and the place feels worn in, but not worn down.  I feel comfortable and welcome every time I visit.  Most weeks I end up ordering a couple beers from the rather large selection.  The drink prices, while high for some people's tastes, are comparable to what I've seen in other places.  Imports are going to cost more, it's the price you pay to have a selection of Boddington's, Murphy's and Guinness all in one place, among other things.  Normally on trivia nights I don't end up getting food, as although I find their portions proportional to the prices, I don't feel I need to eat half my weight in fish and chips in one sitting.  I have no qualms with the quality on the few occasions I've grabbed some eats, for example the curry chicken is very flavorful and highly recommended.  The dragon wings are another of my favorite, spicy but not overwhelming.  The fish and chips, as previously mentioned, are served on a giant platter and have generally been excellent.  I recommend at least one visit to this bar.  Don't be scared off by the divey look of the pub-front.  The F.C. scarves adorning the ceiling, British booze advertisements on the walls, and the cozy but not claustrophobic seating arrangements make it a unique place in the middle of the desert.  If you do visit, pop in on a trivia night so you can listen to the host demean the guests with some clever snide remarks and give yourself an entertaining diversion for a night.  Who knows, you may become a regular before you know it.",

That's all it took to get me hooked on the idea of stopping off for a drink after a hard day's work. And the proximity of George & Dragon to the light rail launched what is my current obsession.  With good intentions, I stopped at G&D yesterday for an Irish Car Bomb and a Guinness, and to get some food to take home and watch a movie. At 5:15 there was hardly anybody there, but I suppose most people are commuting at that time. I overheard another patron ask about their \"Slay The Dragon\" program. Participants, it so happens, are given a card with all of the restaurant's beer listed. The steady drinker consumes one of each (there are 66 different beers!!) within a month and is awarded with an \"I Slayed the Dragon\" t-shirt. What a sweet concept! ***  The steak and kidney pie was also a nice treat, with that certain crispness of the kidney strong but not overpowering. In the past, I've also gotten the fish and chips (FanTasTic!), bangers and mash (excellent) and the wings (very good).  *** I think it would be swell if we organized a daily UYE to help each other through this beer challenge. Even if it's only done during happy hour (4-7) after work,  that's only 3-4 beers a day.",

My test for the quality or likability of a restaurant has to do with would I return to the place and I have to say that this is one place I probably would return to solely with a large group of people who just want to hang have a little fun relax enjoy the atmosphere. You'll notice and some of the other reviews Thursday night is trivia night and the owner went through about 30 reasonably tough questions of succeeding difficulty.

The location was good - right on Central, close to light rail access. Parking was descent in the back. The bar was spacious with pool tables & darts in the entry room, plenty of seating in the dining around and around the bar. It was big enough to accomodate all of the scavengers as well as those patrons wondering what all of these other folks are doing.  Before the scavenger hunt started my friend ordered an Ace Apple Cider. I ordered one as well and it was very sweet. That drink would be dangerous because I could pound those all night not realizing it was alcohol.   We made it back to the George & Dragon a little early (8:30)...still 30 minutes left in the scavenger hunt, but the web site to upload pics to was slow, so we decided to enjoy some apps and drinks at the bar. The appetizers were typical bar food - we ordered the mozzerella sticks, potato skins and another round of Ace Apple Cider. Typical, but tasty. The cheese sticks were very cheese and the 'skins were good. The plate game with a few garnishes of vegetables as well.   The service was excellent too. We were going to order the shrimp, but the waitress indicated there really isn't that many, so perhaps another selection would be better. She was very prompt despite the large crowd. I left a good tips due to the attentiveness and advice.  I love pubs in general and would definitely go back any time.",

They are served with a tangy fruit chutney, and everything is complimented by their exceptional list of beers on *fresh* tap.   Late nights can get a little loud and rowdy but otherwise its a fun and relatively clean establishment. Cant wait to go again!",

    "text": "I'm horrified by the way I got treated this morning. I was told to go in when they open, ask for water( just tap water nothing else.) It was cleared by one of the owners. They said they would fill up our two little water containers for a community event that I was working for.  It was a happy day the two of us from the event went in as happy as can be. When we got in my parter said \"hello\" we got ignored by one bar tender and one waitress. So we waited until they where ready to notice. Then the bar tender said just take a seat we will be with you. That's when we explain our purpose for the visit. The said no we don't know what your talking about. They rolled there eyes at us and just said we don't know anything. I said, you can't give us water from the tap. The bar tender shook her head no and just turned away. They treated us so bad I would never ever go there to eat. That's not how to work with the community. Plus the place was a mess and they had just open. The two workers were so busy working on nothing, to even help us they should be fired. I do believe I was treated this way because of black skin. Shame on you racist workers for treating us like that. Just so you know I am British, born in London but you are to ignorant to notice that different races of people come out of England.",

On top of that there are a couple of them who are just downright rude...not sure if this is the direction the owners have decided to go in but they can count me out, perhaps this is why it's dead whenever I walk in?  The food is just ok....it used to be the \"go to\" when we were feeling super hungry but didn't know what we wanted (it's right around the corner!)  But I try to stay away from the place as much as possible now.     Beer selection is better than most places around here...but the well drinks have consistently been weak throughout the past year.",

    "text": "Can you review non-service? This place tried to ruin my Sunday...but its cool. I'm cool man. I'm cool. I went to the George and Dragon with 4 friends this last Sunday afternoon for a breakfast/brunch and some hair of the dog after a night of trying to kill my stupid liver and all will be well in the world. Right? Found out from the owner's mouth they'll be featured on Bar Rescue soon. This might have been my first hint of things to come but hey this is my first time here and I'll give 'em a shot yeah? The owner is on the patio with his friends drinking and partying. Cool, If I owned a bar and it wasn't slammed (it seemed chill) I'd probably party on a Sunday afternoon too.  The bartender comes out to the patio to take our order. I am patiently waiting my turn to order, I know what I want and I am prepared to deliver this information is in simple and easy to remember terms. We're a five top; she takes 4 orders:1.eggs Benedict, a mimosa, 2. a water and a coke, 3. chicken fried steak, a beer, 4. a chorizo burrito, a beer 5...uh oh, the order's getting too big and she didn't prepare with pen and paper so she's going to go get some and...wow, its odd that I'm still able to remember everyones order and I didn't even write it down, thats weird & then she walks off without taking mine?! I am not sure why.  It wasn't like I was distracted or on my phone or ignoring the event or giving her a dirty look or nuthin'.  But she just walked off as I was trying to order. 5 minutes goes by...so now I've got to follow her inside to order. Okay, no biggie, maybe she just was distracted. It's cool. I'm a mellow dude. I go in and ask if I can also place an order and all will be well in the world. Right? She's busy entering orders into the POS computer.  She says she'll be with me in a minute.  Ok. Cool. A couple walks up next to me at the bar. She'll be with them in a minute.  Ok. cool...so I now assume I'll place my order and head back outside and then the couple that walked up after me will place their order and all will be well in the world. Right? She takes their order first! I'm annoyed because I was there first and I just got done chasing her down and well ok what ever so long as I get to order. So I wait. Finally she acknowledges me, but...she seems a little distracted?  Hmmm....maybe she really was slammed but then why is the owner partying outside lol? ok. I am also a very forgiving person so whatevs...I just want a mimosa and some breakfast.  I order. She says she'll bring it out to the patio with the rest of my friends order. So...cool. I see her enter my order on the POS!  I go outside thinking all will be well in the world. Right?  Our drinks come. To me thats proof that the error has been corrected since my beverage came out with all the others. My mind is at ease and all will be well in the world. Right? 20 minutes later...here comes the bartender...with all the food... except mine....Oh yeah, did I mention it was only 4 out of 5 of us ordering actual food so...yeah...mine didn't come. She explains she'll be right back with mine and walks back inside. All will be well in the world...gulp....Right? Guys? ...right? ...guys? 10 minutes go by... my pals are halfway thru their meals. Another waitress walks up and asks if we're all doing okay. I say no, I am waiting for food and explained that the bartender was supposedly coming right back with it... 10 minutes ago and my friends are almost done eating. She asks if I still want the order. \"SIGH....uh....if you can bring it quickly sure.\" I was still polite. She goes inside... about 5 minutes later the bartender comes out to tell me they are still working on my order. I have nothing to add to the conversation so she walks back inside. 5 minutes go by.  Worst customer service experience I've had in a long time.  My friends are done eating.  I'm done with my drink. I'm done waiting for food. I'm done with this bar. I won't ever come back, not even for free snacks. I pay for my drink without a word. On the upside I saved money on a tip. She tries to explain that they gave my breakfast away to someone else.  Perfect. I don't have any words. I leave. It was suggested by a friend who was with me that I complain but that to me seems like a practice in futility. I already brought it to two peoples attention and there were no positive results. Besides, you can't upset a fat man over food and expect him to be rational.  If the bartender hasn't figured it out by now there's no fixing it. I mean didn't they just have a team of pros swoop in to save their business?  I think Bar Rescue missed a spot when they painted the place; they should've painted a big sign out front that read \"Under new management, now hiring competent staff!\" or maybe \"GOOD NEWS! We're shutting our doors! Going out of business sale!\" Terrible Pub 1(after all the mimosa was okay & the bartender apologized) Bar Rescue 0, hung over light rail rider...also a 0 and all was well in the world. Right? Guys?",

A True art of brewing. $14. This is a 750 ml bottle, poured into a shaker glass. This is a great price for the large bottle in a bar.  Fish and Chips, it only made sense to enjoy a dish that corrisponds with the Olympic Host Team. Have to say the food was on the money tonight. The kitchen probably served a hundred of these plates.

I saw some nearby Mexican spot but, I walked by and it didn't seem very welcoming or happening. I found this spot and thought I would just check it out.   Now first appearances can be deceiving, the place seems kinda seedy and definitely divey. You can definitely tell that regulars are a staple here.   I was crazy hungry and discovered they serve food until 1 am everyday... Kinda risky at a lot of places because kitchen staff usually falls off in quality around 11-12pm in most places that look like this.   I ordered a BLT and I have to say it was pretty damn good for the time I ordered. Bacon was crispy and the tomatoes and lettuce didn't taste old. Soooo gooood! Definitely hit the spot.  Super surprised and glad I wandered in to here as it doesn't seem like there is too many options in this area around the late time I showed up. Next time I am in the area, I will definitely be back. Compliments to the kitchen and bar tenders for holding it down. You know its good when you hear a bar tender mention she watches Bar Rescue. Always looking to improve upon themselves!  ( I am personally a fan of the show, so I might be biased in that sense. )   Keep up the awesome work!",

Ask the staff on how they do it, mine looked perfect.  The meatloaf was ok nothing impressive but the fish and chips and the halo cheeseburger were excellent.  I love  the lighting in the place gives it a kitschy touch.  Atmosphere is nice and casual, I've been here numerous occasions by myself and just relaxing.  Definitely on my regular list and I'm taking the bangers and mash home for my lunch tomorrow.",

Jana, HayHay and Kitty are absolutely amazing. When we sit at the bar, they took the time to really get to know us. When we walk in, they usually have our drinks before we sit down. That says something. They actually care about us and remember our faces. Jen, Kara, Kaytee, Ryann, all the Laura's, and anyone else I may have forgotten always has a smile on their face. Pending on where we sit or who's section we are in, if they are working, they always make time to visit our table. It's really nice to feel so welcome in this restaurant.  The food is very tasty. My husband loves the wings. They are always cooked just right. The English Kabob or the Halo cheese burger are his go to dishes. I always like to try new things so I've tried almost everything. I absolutely love the Fish and Chips, Stuffed Meatloaf and my absolute favorite, Chicken Curry.   The owner David is also a sweet man. If he is in the pub when we are there, he always visits and asked how things are going. Now this is not just to our table but he will walk around to each table to greet everyone and introduce himself.   We love this place so much, we asked if we could buy the pub for the night to celebrate our 1 year anniversary and throw the wedding celebration there as I did not get to wear white at the time we eloped. David worked with us for over a year to make sure we had all we needed to make the night great. We are blessed to have such good people around to help make our day so special.  Thank you George and Dragon. Here is to many more years. We will see you soon!",

James and Janae are horrible service managers who are constantly drunk on duty and we would have gladly paid for our food and beverage if they had apologized for their atrocious behavior. 0/10 would recommend.

The bar is comfortable, and they have British beer on tap--stuff like Boddington's.   The food is tasty and reliable. Stick with the specialties--the shepherd's pie, bangers and mash, cornish pasties, roast beef.  I've never found a reason to complain about the service.  There's a community built up around it, and you can occasionally meet real, live, BRITISH PEOPLE there! Imagine that!  So, a favorite of mine.",

Specifically the bartenders and servers are inattentive and slightly clueless about the service industry and only mildly affable.  I consider Corin the gold standard of bartenders and miss her a great deal. I have not seen her in quite a while and assume she has moved on which explains the new staff.   Last night some friends and I were going to go to the G&D and I changed my mind at the last minute. I told my friends of the the change of venue and they were briefly shocked and confused (they are sensitive folks).  I reminded them of how bad the service has been the last several times we were there and with very little disagreement they also decided a change of venue was in order.  I like the G&D but the staff has been changing for the worse. Last night was the first night I could confirm that the staff there is costing the owner money. If I had no regard for the establishment then I would just stop going there and never take the time to write this review.  I'll be back in a few months to see how things are going...",

When our friends arrived not more than 20 minutes later and we walked back over to find George had towed our car from the parking lot!! We had full intentions of spending copious amounts of money in that dirty dive, but now I will never return. They towed our vehicle to cave creek northern valley and the 200$ spent on the tow, we could have spent on drinks celebrating in this establishment! I'll never be back and being in the industry I will make sure to spread the negative word!!! Thanks George and dragon, your greedy jealous owner does not go unnoticed! No wonder the place was a ghost town and smells like garbage!",

As for the service, it was pretty bad.  It was a Wednesday so it was not busy but there were two waitresses and two bar tenders.  The non-alcoholic drinks are not listed on the menu and when me and my boyfriend (both at separate times) asked what they had the girl literally ignored us and then walked away.  When she came back with water I asked again and she said, \"Soups?\"  I had to ask yet AGAIN.  After she served us our food we did not see her for 30 mins.  I literally mean she did not come out of the back for 30 minutes and I had to ask someone else to get her so we could get our check and go.  We had wanted dessert but did not want to put up with the service anymore so we left.",

    "text": "I like George, so I was really looking forward to their Sunday roast special. I've wanted to try it for at least a few years now, however long they've been running it, anyway. Due to my schedule, today was the first free Sunday afternoon I have been able to. The roast beef was tender, the gravy was perfect and so were the mashed and fried potatoes. However, the Yorkshire Pudding was not good. It's supposed to be golden brown. Mine was very dark brown and burned black around the edges. Basically inedible although I tried. I ate the less burned bottom half, which tasted overcooked, a flavor that repeated on me for the next few hours. When I mentioned that it was overcooked to the waitress, she was very nice and offered to bring me a new one. Then she came back and told me that the kitchen said it was supposed to be that way and all the others looked like that, too. She offered to get a manager so I could discuss it with them. I declined since I have better things to do with my day off than argue that the kitchen should know how to cook the special properly. I did Google Yorkshire  Pudding and looked at all the images just to prove to myself that I was right about the golden brown they're supposed to be. I left very disappointed that my first taste of something I'd waited so long to try was so subpar. All in all, I give the Sunday roast special about a 50%. Cook the Yorkshire Pudding properly and I'll try it again. Otherwise, I'll just go somewhere else Sunday.",

Seems like a happening, dive-bar type environment.  They were finishing up a poker tournament which it seems like there's one like every day.  Not sure why they left all the tvs on a channel with a cleft-palate infomercial for a charity pretty much all night, it was kind of a downer...  The pasties were phenominal.  A definitely must-try, and will get every time I go there.  The wings were so-so, we ordered medium which were pretty hot, but there wasn't much to the sauce but Red-hot it seemed.  The fish and chips were good, which some places mess up with the batter being undercooked but they seemed to do a pretty good job.  The shepherd's pie was ok, though isn't it supposed to have a crust at the bottom?  Wasn't sure.  All-in-all, a good place to start off a night or hang out for a game.  Would not go for more than a happy hr type venture.",

    "text": "This was our second venture to this joint: the first time was a disaster as we didn't even get noticed once so no food or drink was to be had. The staff gets perfect marks for ignoring us, This time the joint wasn't to busy so figured we would have a decent chance at getting service. Well we sort of got service from a staff member who seemed annoyed we bothered her to order. The drinks were slow to come out and for beer it wasn't very cold. Before we could ask for waters our server ran away. We did finally order \"food\" the curry wings looked like a pile of gooey vomit and didn't taste much better. There were three of us at the table, each regretfully had one wing and shoved the rest to the side. I ordered the Halo burger which had a crisp cheddar ring around it which was the best part. The burger itself was something straight from the freezer, pre-made greasy as all can be. No flavor and the condiments that came with the burger were the standard fare. The steak fries as a side should have stayed in the kitchen. They were underdone and soggy. No flavor either. My wife ordered the french dip, something that usually you can't screw up. Well these guys at G&D are batting 1000 with subpar food, I've tasted better french dips at hospital cafeterias. Our friend ordered the Reuben grinder, he said it was OK, but again the fries stayed on the plate. Our wait staff was non existent. She never bothered to check on us once. We had to stand up to show that we were ready for our check...that really didn't work so our friend had to track her down. Plan to ask for your check well ahead of time as they do not value your time. I guess we are the idiots for trying the place again but really you might get em on a bad day so give them the benefit of the doubt and try em again. Well twice was WAY more than I will be spending there. I know they have a lot of regulars and maybe these folks are fine with the usual horrible AZ customer service and crappy food. I for one, coming from Chandler, like to enjoy a decent meal. We didn't order anything complex yet this joint managed to make even a simple burger just plain bad.",

I've never seen a friendlier environment in any other place I've been, bar or restaurant!   My beer and drinks have always been cold, I've never had to wait longer than reasonable for my orders, not to mention the price you pay for a drink here is the best in town! They constantly have drink specials and shot specials that are very easy on the wallet, not so easy on the liver! :)  As for the food, they have recently revamped the menu and I have tried something new every time I order. I am happy to say I still have not been disappointed. They also offer salads, wraps, and other items for those looking for something a little on the lighter side!  And as for the environment, pool tables and darts are great ways to let the food settle and enjoy a drink or four. The juke box is connected to the internet so you don't have a limited selection of music, and the patio is a great place to enjoy the Arizona climate! If you're a karaoke singer, poker player, or just want to test your knowledge on trivia, they have something for you here too!!!  It doesn't matter how I spend my day, I can always tell you how it ends, at the George & Dragon!",

Trivia, Karaoke, TV's, Beer, Wings, Scotch Eggs, Pool tables, cigarette machines, children running around screaming.. you name it, they probably have it.   The first time I came here was for trivia night.. it was dramatic and everyone was cheating, but the loaded potato app. made everything all right in my world.  The second time I came here was after the Switch OYE, which I totally don't remember.. as Brad E.'s review noted, there was a game that involved me falling asleep sitting up and everyone screaming my name as loudly as possible to interrupt my slumber, or something.... There was also war paint and apparently I ran into some co-workers.. I didn't believe them until a photo surfaced. I will say no more.  The third time I came here was for Georgie S.' 8th 26th birthday celebration. We actually came here twice, once for after brunch boozing, and the second time to sing Karaoke, but mostly we just listened to Nathan S. serenade us for 3 hours.. football was on, many beers were consumed, the photos reflected a happy setting and im pretty sure the bday girl was pleased with her final celebration. At least, it was supposed to be the final. I'm pretty sure it wasn't.   The 5th time I came here was last night.. for football and beers. As always, I was content and happy, enjoying myself and the wedding reception debauchery (yes there was really a wedding reception here) that was going on..  I just generally enjoy this place, there is always parking, its right off the rail, the bathrooms are gross, but manageable, food is actually really good for bar-fare, especially the English selections.. Great beer selection, KILTLIFTER WHAAAAT, full bar, always an interesting crowd and everyone is always having a great time.   Totally come here. Me and my friends will probably be there too.",

You guys are a joke and should have communicated better. I would expect nothing less than an apology from the a$$hole who said he didn't know all the \"unregular drunks\" he's used to on a Saturday.

It is perfectly seasoned and the crispy cheese on it is so so good! We also got the French dip and the au jus was suuuper tasty! The fries are thick and crispy yet soft on the inside. Yummy! I felt bad because I went to ask the bar for a server because i wasn't sure how the service worked when i walked in and when i turned around the server was already standing at our table (sorry!) anyway we had a wonderful attentive server, she even made me a cherry pepsi!

Some still seem like they are stuck in the 80's listing to their metal bands but hey that is why I like living downtown because you see all types which is cool.",

The place is decorated with a lot of wood, English football banners and scarves, TVs with football (soccer) playing and both tables and booths, other than the bar. There is a dining hall next to the main room, a few pool tables and jukebox and nightly events.  G&D is always a great time, one of the best places to meet up with friends for dinner and drinks.",

We have been here 2x and once to the now dead & gone G&D at the Hampton Inn off the I-10 and 143 freeways. We've never had the time to eat. It was just a place we'd hit for some Stellas or cider waiting to do something else or just wasting some time. Great place to hang out for quickie beer. The hubs is on a quest for the best fish tacos & the best fish & chips. Me not so much. So he suggests trying the fish & chips. I cave even though I'm full to the gills because I'm afraid if I don't say yes this time he may just leave my fat a$$ there. So we try the almighty fish & chips. He's expecting greatness he's disappointed. I wasn't expecting anythng & full so of course I didn't think it was the best either. Don't take this like it sucked by any stretch of the imagination. It's just not what we thought we'd get from an English pub known for it's fish & chips. I mean it was just ok. I think it was missing some seasoning on the fish & I personally dislike any steak fry that has salt as the only seasoning. Totally me totally my taste. If I'm gonna throw a fry down my gullet with all of it's artery clogging ways it's going to be for a reason. Like um I don't know taste. It's going to be goo-od period. The fish is fried perfectly, crispy, hot & juicey. The fries aka chips are just that & just what you get when ordering fish & chips. So bare in mind the fish & chips are good the service is spot on & the place is fun to hang out at. Good times at the G&D!",

Sadly, our two favorite menu items no longer exist at the George:  the philly and the sliders.  Well, this meant we had to look at the menu.  I decided on the English kabash, and it was good!

I would definitely say the crowd is not really my scene, but once you throw a few back then you sort of forget the atmosphere.   The only thing I would criticize is the service.

Unfortunately, I was at work so I could not drink alcohol, but the food was great. I had fish and chips and my co-worker had bangers and mash. The fish was some of the best I've had, and the person with me enjoyed his food as well. The prices were decent, and the service was great.   Even though I was not drinking this time, I could not help but notice the excellent selection of draft beers. I really wish I was closer so I could have some booze at this place. Alas, I live in Ahwatukee.   For those of you who are closer and enjoy the pub atmosphere, George and Dragon is highly recommended, though I imagine the place is a zoo when there's a big soccer match. The last time I was here I was not impressed, and had not been back since. But this last visit was wonderful. Either something changed, or I just caught them on a bad day last time.",

Major dislikes would include not-so-clean bathrooms, and a fight broke out in the pool table area. I can't remember the last time I was around a barroom brawl.  The food is pretty good and really reasonably priced. They have a really good drink menu including a huge selection of rare beers. I got a chopped salad, but beware, it is not actually chopped...  The service left a little to be desired, but wasn't bad. There were only two waitresses for the whole bar on a Saturday, so that could have something to do with it.

This place always has something fun going on whether it be karaoke, dart/pool tournaments, trivia, etc. The crowd is always a rambunctious and disorderly one, but that just makes it more fun. Eye candy is always abound here as well. I've never seen so many freshly 21 year.... wait this is a family friendly site.  Drinks here are not any more expensive than other brit/irish pubs, but I always do like to order two at a time because it gets to be busy and waiting for a bartender or cocktail waitress can take a few minutes. They have three dart boards, one real and two electronic, as well as two pool tables and a couple arcade games. There is also an electronic jukebox that seems to have every song known to man.  After 10+ visits I've never had any food here, so I cannot comment on that, but who eats at a place like this anyway? It's a funbar!",

The George used to feature the pinnacle of excellent service, excellent beverages and delicious comfort food.  Unfortunately what's done them in is their service.  The drinks and food are still exceptional, but the service level has faltered.  Really, losing 2 whole stars for degraded service?  I went in again recently after about a year hiatus and I was unfortunately reminded.  Go for the drinks, the food, the darts (real or computer) or the pool... but not for the service.",

This place has been here for awhile considering my mom used to come here with her friends 15 years ago. I dragged her back in even though she swore up and down it was a tacky and \"not so good\" place to eat. Of course times change and so does the food, right?  We shared the famous Shepherd's pie. Which was the \"not so good\" food she was referring too from 15years ago. It was more than enough for the 2 of us and could possibly be shared between 3 people depending on how much each person eats. Her verdict was that its much bigger and better than what she remembered having. The gravy goes along amazingly with it so dont skip out. We also ordered a side house salad which was really good with their ranch. The homemade lemonade was really great too if your into that type of drink. Lighting was very dim, but service and energy of the place was cozy and welcoming. Im excited to come back and try more things on the menu!",

Ryann was an amazing server who had to handle 60-75 patrons while the owner was running food- which happened to be cold. I had to wait over an hour for my first drink, which was no fault to Ryan as there were 2 bartenders staffed. After a friend posted a review, the owner ridiculed verse offering an apology or justification for being understaffed. I will not attend this restaurants again and will advocate as such. Toward our stay, an employee stormed out of the bar and even broke the door on her way out.",

The decor of dark wood in a dimly lit open room oozes English pub to me.  Great place to watch sports, you can sit anywhere inside and see a screen if that is what you want to do, if not look around and you'll see all our famous English football (soccer) teams scarfs (all bar the most famous Leeds United FC, I'll have to donate one of mine)  the waiting staff are friendly and attentive and the menu has all the classic English dishes, my recommendation would be a full English breakfast off the weekend brunch menu ( only thing missing was a slice of black pudding) food was great and my wife was sold on how good an English breakfast is.   Have been here since and had a Sunday roast dinner again warm hearty food cooked to a good standard.",

The day I was there for a drink at the bar  the guys to my right started a conversation about trump caging children, which is a normal convo here in Arizona, and the owners brother came up to the bar to vocalize his approval that kids were being separated  from their moms and locked into cages.   Within that rant he repeated several lies from the right/Fox News that I focused on correcting and from that he kept repeating more lies.   This lasted maybe a minute, I got frustrated and left.   That's quite a bizarre way to run a biz in Arizona, clearly anti Hispanic, but whatever.  They get 1 star for having cold beer, and the bartenders were nice.  I hope they find better work once this place is gone.   They're clearly on their last leg and they know if.",

No one was sent to beat anyone up - lol - and they refused to pay their bill. It was then that management had sent them away due to their hostile attitude and intoxication.  James was very understanding and patient with the boys. Jana was making light fun and smiles the entire time.  Also James and Jana have been sober for years.

The fries are very good as well; don't call them \"French fries\". Lots of sports on the TVs; after all it's a bar as well. I hear that if you love The English soccer teams this is the spot to be.

There's a nice selection of beers for a reasonable $5 a pint. I had some Ace Pear, but there were tons of ales I'd never heard of to choose from. I'll be back for those.  There are plenty of activities to keep busy while getting trashed here. I've never seen so much room in a bar devoted to dartboards. It was right in the corner with ample throwing room, and I loved it! There are also a couple billiards tables, some light gun arcade game (Try it after a few--don't shoot the cows!) and even some patrons sitting at poker tables.   I'm definitely coming back here to play darts and watch rugby. Maybe I'll even try their fish and chips. I wonder though...do Brits really hang out here?",

The best part of the experience hands down was the staff. They were friendly and accommodating. It's great to have English fare in Phoenix!!!!",

Both times I think the tap needs to be replaced because the stout was not as thick and creamy as usual. But the pubs in the UK did spoil me. The portions were a little small. We had to order seconds to feel full.   Make sure you try the HP sauce on whatever you order. This is a thick, tangy steak sauce that makes every flavor soar.   It does smell a little bar-like inside.",

    "text": "I stopped by here a few weeks ago for a quick lunch.  I had been here once before but it was just for drinks.  I had never been there before for a meal.  Meal:  I went with the special, which was just a roast beef sandwich and fries.  I had a New Castle beer to go along with it.  Taste: Talk about the most boring meal ever!  The sandwich had no flavor, the cheese was bland, and the fries didn't have any salt or other seasoning.  I must have went through an entire bottle of ketchup to give the meal some sort of life.  This meal did not even come close to stimulating my taste buds.  The meat was cooked halfway decently and the fries were done well, but not for the love of Christ, bring some salt if you intend to eat here.  2 out of 10.  Value: The prices were fair and reasonable.  The portion size seemed right in line the pricing. 3 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  The waitress was new but did a great a job being attentive.  She seemed to have a good grasp of the menu and the beer selection.  She had a great attitude and was friendly.  Nothing indicated to me that the place isn't clean. 10 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  Nothing too exciting, but it should be considered that this place isn't in business for the lunch crowd.  The decor is decent.  The time I was here before my lunch visit, the place seemed to be lively without being annoying.  4 out of 5.  Overall:  Don't go here for the food.  Just come here for a few drinks for a quiet Friday night.  If you really, really, really need to eat here, go to Penzeys Spices first because what George and Dragon is to food is what Sheriff Joe is for civil rights.  19 out of 30 points, 2 out of 5 stars.",

We sat in a comfy booth and had their wonderful sampler platter, which came with mozzarella sticks, onion rings, potato skins, chicken strips and fried zucchini.

A lot of the knocks on the place I won't disavow - it's dim and not sparkling, but so what?  If that's a huge turn-off, you're better off elsewhere.  I like to think the place has personality.  But if you like a huge selection of beer (including Boddington's, Kronenbourg, and Chimay) and good food, you'll probably have a good time here.

Inside is outdated, but comes with the territory.  Beer selection is great, food is about average.   Service is a little below average.  I have been here at least a half dozen times and have yet to not have a struggle to get a drink order in.  And I have never been here on a Friday, Saturday, or a busy night for that matter.  I guess unless you are a regular the bartenders don't pay much attention to the rest of the customers.  Location sucks unless you are at an event at Steele Indian School Park or maybe doing a light rail pub crawl.  Too far away from Downtown and not close enough to Camelback(Midtown).  Not a must see, but if your eyeballs want to see something different I say go for it.",

    "text": "There has been so much anticipation to go to G&D for Karaokee on mondays.  After a great bbq we all decided to go and sing our hearts out...well we arrived at about 10pm...added our names to the list...cheered othered singers on to encourage a good time, spent some money and tipped well....and waited patiently....well after 2.5 hours have gone by we had seen the same three girls go up the several times before we have...we get it...if they got there before us and signed up, its their turn...but then the host started singing songs and kept picking \"random\" chicks to sings songs...ok...now its getting weird.  Then when we saw the person that signed up right before us go up and then one of the same \"three\" girls and then the host \"randomly\" pick again.....we got pissed of and were ready to leave.  We were pissed and cashed out.  Then when we told the karaokee host that he was an ass and that we had been waiting over 2 hrs and were pissed, he pretty much talked crap and walked away.  Then he had the nerve to call our names when we walked right out of the door.  We came back in and talked to management.  We were there to have a good time and spend money.  I would rather spend my money elsewhere.  Star karaokee sux, IDK what the hell Michael the Karaokee host from star karaokee's problem was, but he was completely unprofessional and just plain RUDE.  We get it, you have your regulars, but we are cusotmers too.....we would have brought more people back in the future...but you can have fun with the same three people for your pitiful karaokee night.",

    "text": "Last night was my first visit to George and Dragon....and unfortunately, it will probably be my last.  My boyfriend, my daughter and I decided to go there for FATHER'S DAY.  We walked in the front door and stood in the middle of the room facing the bar.  There were maybe 6 or 7 occupied tables--it wasn't busy.  So we stood there, unsure of wether we sat ourselves or waited to be seated.  3 servers were present as well as a blonde bartender who totally ignored us.  Finally we asked if we sat ourselves and the bartender said to go right ahead.  We picked a booth facing the bar and sat.  And sat........and sat......and sat.  One male bartender seemed to be working in a back room only.  Another girl stood alongside the bar, staring out @ us, drinking a soda as we sat there with no menus.  The bartender, who was maybe 15 feet from us, would look @ us sideways, and look away.  My boyfriend works for the City of Phoenix.  He's a HUGE tipper.  Maybe we don't look like much, but...??????? We waited 12 minutes (I am a server/bartender myself, so I watch greet times closely).  Finally we stood up and walked out...walked RIGHT past the bartender and she never said a word!!!!!!!!!!  I did call a spoke to a managernamed Bill, who sounded shocked.  I hope he took care of the problem or they will lose a LOT of business =(  We ended up having a very nice Father's Day dinner @ The Black Forest Mill...thumbs up to them!",

In the days before the light rail destroyed Central Avenue I would come here from time to time, and it was always ok. Not especially good or bad, just ok.  Beers are expensive but they have a good selection of foreigns to test out. What is mildly discouraging is that even the domestics are overpriced.  They occassionally host cool events or concerts here and I highly recommend dropping in on days like those, but aside from that, whatever.",

Well, the problem is, they don't keep all the beers in stock so...boo.  Also, it kind of is a two-faced place...one Friday you'll go there and you wont be able to park and there will be standing room only inside...but the next Friday it's dead.  But, please go check it out, it's really awesome and the owners are knows to mingle with the crowed, can't miss them, they're the ones with the English accents.  CHEERS!",

    "text": "My husband lived in England and had a strong reccomendation on this place because of the food.  We didn't make it that far.    When we walked in everything look dirty- the floors, walls, booths, pool tables - and the place was dimly lit!  I could not believe this bar served food.  Nothing about it said restaurant.  The decor was everything British which may have been cute if they took a rag and wipe the dust off.  No one greeted us when we walked in so we just sat down at a table.  There was a waitress wandering around that looked just as lost as we did.  She finally came over and gave us some menus, took our drink order and that was it... we never saw her again.  While we waited we had a while to look over the menu.  All the British food sounded like some type of variation of pot roast.  I guess that's what British cuisine consists of but none of it sounded appealing.  Still waiting it gave me more time to look around and I started to get angry because I couldn't believe I was about to order food from such a dirty establishment (I could only imagine what the kitchen looked like).  I was shocked to see kids running around... I wouldn't take Bebe's kids in there.   I clocked it; for 15 minutes we sat there without food or drinks, just menus.  Our booth faced the bar and the bartenders looked at us a few times but never sent anyone over to our table. Could I have asked for our server?  Sure.  But by this point I knew I wasn't spending a dime here and wanted to see how long it would take someone to come over to us so I could tell what I thought of their service.  Finally we receded, parched and starving we got up and left the George & Dragon.  What a waste of time!",

I was introduced to the friendly, British bar, by a good friend of mine who was determined to slay the dragon (which she finally did after 2 or 3 years.) I have to be honest, I have never had a meal at this place, but I have had plenty to drink. Just the other day, my running club met up for drinks after our long run, and it just so happened to be trivia night! If it wasn't for work the next day, we would have stayed the entire night and finished up the game. A couple of my friends did end up ordering dinner from the menu. I have to say that the fish looked delish! The only downfall to this place is that it does get a little loud during the busy nights and the sound system can be a little better for those who are trying to listen to the trivia questions (on Thursday). Overall, this is a very friendly, neighborhood bar and I am definitely not about to cut this one from the list.",

    "text": "\"Fancy a shoe shine Governaaa?\"  (Governor for you non-British)  Authentic British style Pub...enough said. George & Dragon is fabulous! On the outside it looks mediocre at best, though the British feel is felt as soon as you walk in and see all the different Football Club Flags, Football Jerseys, (Soccer for you non-British) and UK country flags, and other miscellaneous pub paraphernalia. Inside, the place is warm and inviting, the tables have the Union Jack, English Cross, and London Underground Logos on them. The crescent shape booths are comfortable, and the bar has ample seating. This is place you go to with friends, or a date, and just spend hours talking over some pints.  The music is chosen by the patrons via a \"secret\" jukebox, so it can vary from Van Morrison, to Curtis Mayfield, to Outkast.  I went with my favorite pub \"friend', one that we can just talk for several hours and not really notice the time, so it made the experience that much more enjoyable. This is really a place you can just loose track of time and amount of pints consumed, as you expect to walk outside and hop on some form of public transportation and make your way back to your flat (apartment for you non-British). I guess the war zone that is Central Ave, will bring us a form of transportation in this area, but judging by the condition of this road, we have a bit of time to wait.  As I was waiting for my friend I chatted up a guy sitting outside about how I drove from The Roosevelt to G&D on Central Ave. He asked me \"what do you have a 4x4?\" and was serious. I said \"No I have a Golf, but it's German.\"  Moral of this story, avoid Central Ave. at all costs.   The one small downside, (bathroom issue) is the size of the bathrooms, they have just one toilet,  for men and one for women, which really is meant  for just one person at a time. In traditional European fashion,  I was \"doubled up on\".  As I went in to relieve myself, a dude just followed me in and was planning on using the above mentioned toilet, as I took the urinal.  I said \"Hey, you doubling up in here?\" He proceeded to respond \"Hey we are guys, it's cool\" This is the type of place that doubling up in the men's bathroom is OK, it just adds to th charm, hey you could triple up here, as they do have a sink as well. ;)",

I stopped in here on a whim while spending a Saturday on the lightrail ( I made good use of my day pass).  I had also read at one time this pub served Scotch Eggs, mmmm.   As it was dinner time-ish I ordered up a Smithwicks and some Scotch Eggs.  Now I have had these served a variety of ways in the past and my preference is lightly breaded yet crisp crust with a relatively thick layer of sausage, served room temp to slightly warm.   Here they are served cold and quartered.  These were also some of the largest Scotch eggs I have had.  I got over the fact they were as cold as they were and begin to enjoy the flavor of the sausage layer with a hint of nutmeg.  The balsamic \"chutney\" served  with them was great, in the past at other places I usually enjoy a course deli mustard. What I didn't like about these Scotch eggs was the breaded layer.  Becasue they are premade fried and stored in the fridge the breaded layer was like a rubber mat.  I peeled off this layer and continued to enjoy my meal.",

Also had the pretzel for an appetizer. The pretzel was obviously previously frozen and the cheese on the side was from a vat. Would not recommend. Fiance had a bland burger, although the fries were tasty. This is a cool place to get a drink and hang out, but I would say avoid the majority of food. We won't be eating here again.",

Said there are roaches all over downtown Phoenix, and if I didn't like it to get out of there.  Almost as shocking as the roach was the guys reaction. I will NOT go back, obviously, and I make sure and tell anyone I talk to about this incident anytime the place is mentioned. What a terrible place and a terrible way to treat a customer.",

    "text": "George & Dragon! After driving by you for months, I finally decided to stop in. Very nice!  Well, pretty nice. Maybe just nice. The four star rating is very weak, but I decided to bump up from 3 to 4 because we had a good time. I like that this place is low key and not pretentious. I like that on Sundays, they play different football games rather than just focusing on the Cardinals. And I like that they host different things, like live music and trivia nights.  The food is very bland. However, it's a bar, so expecting the meal of your life is a little silly. It isn't greasy, bad bar food; it's average and a little overpriced. I would stick to a simple appetizer and some drinks in the future.  Fish and chips were OK - the corn was definitely frozen, and I think the fish may have been as well. Burger was very simple and bland. I did like the thick cut fries, but they were probably frozen as well. Portions were pretty good, which is a plus.  The service was OK. A little lackluster - our server seemed a bit frazzled, and she was the only one working the dining room. There were several tables that hadn't been cleared of the dirty dishes after the customers had left, so seating was limited based on that. The restaurant isn't dirty, but it isn't immaculate, either.  I can definitely see why people wouldn't like this place, but for me, it's close to home, and it's a good place to relax without being around a huge crowd. If you stop in, don't expect too much, and you'll (hopefully) be pleasantly surprised like my husband and I were.",

The cornish pasty was by far my favorite dish.  If I had only that for dinner I would have given 4 stars.  The fish and chips though were too thickly breaded.  It really over powered the fish, and wasn't even cooked long enough to make the breading crisp.  It was just too heavy.  I wish the breading was thinner and crisper.  This is why I rated only a three.  It makes me wonder about the rest of the dishes.  Maybe I'll get another chance to eat here again.",

Not only can you enjoy great food, delicious beers and fun people, the winners of trivia get free food and drinks! How does this not sound like a great place to visit?!

She gave us a little low down on the stories behind the restaurant and it is always nice to hear about family run businesses. Anyway, the booth we sat in has seen (MUCH) better days but I didnt really mind it because it went with the divey feel. Beers are pretty cheap.  Between the 3 of us we ordered the sheapards pie, fish and chips and i forgot what the third was called but it was a roast beef and swiss sandwich with dip. The sheapards pie was by far the best thing on the table with the fish part of the fish and chips next. The corn that came with the fish and chips were literally straight out of a can or frozen bag and the fried were pretty bland as well. They were playing a weird mix of country and justin beiber music that just wasnt doing it for me. All together, pretty solid dive bar if they cahnge up the music and season the fries/veggies a bit more.",

In the past, I enjoyed their fish and chips which were really good. On another visit I tried a distinctively British dish which they no longer offer on their menu: steak and kidney pie; that I wasn't a fan of, mainly because they used puff pastry instead of regular pie pastry for the crust.  Both times I enjoyed the very informal atmosphere and the friendliness of the staff. On this recent visit I encountered the same friendliness and the relaxed pub atmosphere, and proceeded to order roast beef with mashed potatoes and peas. I asked if they had Yorkshire pudding, which is a traditional British accompaniment to roast beef, but the server said they serve that only on Sundays (shucks). The meal was definitely adequate, but the very thinly-sliced roast beef had a flavor that beef gets when stored in refrigeration after cooking. I will come back as this is definitely a nice gathering place with friends, but next time I'll stick to the tried-tested-and-True fish and chips.",

    "text": "I went to High School down the street and use to see this place all the time. I met a couple of friends here once almost 10 years ago? I remember it being crowded with booths and the food was not that great.  I've since gone back a few times....all in the same month it seems! Walking in it had changed from the crowded booths. Mostly high tables right in front of the long bar. Smaller seats are on the other side of the divider. It was pretty empty but we've gone during the week and early so I wasn't bothered by that all! The same busy decorations all around, with the extra splash of Halloween.  Greeted quickly by Erika, she writes her name on the napkins which I liked, which I commented on right away. I ordered the Lemonade, my friend got the Iced Tea. And the lemonade was so delicious!  My friend ordered the Bangers and Mash, 3 huge sausages with a pile of mashed potatoes and peas. He really enjoyed it and had left overs for the next day. He also got the House Salad, which was served on a regular sized plate, filled to the edges! I ordered the Caesar Salad, which between the two, I liked the House Salad more. I also got the Honey Siracha wings, and these are so damn good I would slide my finger across the bottom of the plate to get more of the flavor.  Another visit we both did the Fish N Chips, huge pieces of fish, THICK meat inside - so good!! He got the Broccoli and Cheese soup which Erika recommended, and damn I wish I got my own! I split the appetizer Cornish Pastie. It was like mashed meat and peas inside a flaky crust. Didn't care for the pastie, just picked around it as the crust was yummie!  This last time around I told Erika I've been wanting the Creamy Tomato soup, she told me to come in on Mondays, as thats when it was served. And to also get the grilled cheese along with it. Which we did end up doing, Erika wasn't there that day but the bartender served us...she served everyone really including the bar. She did a great job BTW, very attentive to each table/bar, even had time to kick out a drunk! LOL It was a little confusion as the grilled cheese came with fries and it was technically the kids meal. But we informed the young lady that Erika recommended it. So she quickly spoke with the boss and processed our order no problem. When we were served it was just the sandwhich and soup, OMG both were delicious! I just wish they gave us a bowl instead of these little cups for our soup. When our waitress realized we didn't get fries, she quickly addressed it, apologized and put it in. I didn't mind it as the fries are the steak fries and I don't care for those. But the ones she brought were well done/extra crispy and I couldn't stop picking at them. Now I know how to order these if or when it comes with.  So far our experience here has been positive and everything we ordered was just so damn good I can't wait to go back.",

The cheeseburger on the other hand was completely tasteless; clearly cooked without any seasoning, even salt. At this point, no matter how much salt you add after the fact, it still will be bland. Our waitress was cool and offered to fix it (which she did by removing it from our bill), but when we spoke to the owner, he claimed they don't use salt to season because of people's allergies. He also threw it back in our face saying he eats those burgers twice a week! All while eating the fries that were well seasoned.   Poor customer service!",

When mentioned to the manager as to the validity of that statement, he exclaimed is due to food allergies & that he personally eat the burgers twice a week and it tastes just fine. Interesting though, the fries & meatloaf & everything else can have salt. Must be the composition of burger meat that activates allergen production on human beings that they chose to refrain from seasoning their burgers. I felt it was a lack of accountability on the manager's part. Total BS, no pun intended.",

Had the lunchtime fish and chips which came with a little side of coleslaw. The chips seemed prepared from frozen, the slaw was gloppy with mayo and had no flavor but the thick mayo. The cod was excellent with a light batter, tender and moist, but the portion was too small. I was expecting something the size of a size of a usual piece of fish from Long John Silver's or the usual size when you buy frozen pieces at the supermarket. The Guinness is good esp. the interesting mixtures you can have like the Black and Tan or the ciders with beer, but prices should come down a bit esp. during the non-happy hours to make them a little happier. Some mood music would be nice too. It's great that it's on the light rail route.",

This review fits into the second category.    Many years ago, I used to work in Phoenix, and used to eat lunch at the George and Dragon.  I used to be served promptly, the food was delicious, and I enjoyed the place.  But time has not been kind to this place.    We went on 03/22/2014  We were kept waiting for 15 minutes before our 'server' brought us menus.   We kept having to ask for refills on our sodas.  We placed our order, and she didn't write anything down, which is actually a peeve of mine.    We noticed other people came in, were seated, and then because they ordered alcohol were served their meals promptly, and the server scurried over to refill their drinks.    We called another server over twice to ask for refills, and he couldn't be bothered.    We ended up waiting almost an hour and a half before we ended up paying for our drinks and leaving.  We complained to the manager but he didn't seem to care either.  We walked out, and warned other patrons going in.    It is sad that what was a good place has slipped so far, and that the only customers that matter are those that order alcohol.   Avoid this place.  Terrible service.  Enough said.",

Never have been approached and welcomed like this before. The beer and drinks were cold and the atmosphere is super welcoming.  There are a few other reviews on this site that mention how \"slow\" the service was or how they had a horrible experience. Yet, those days they mentioned were Sunday night when the bar is on a one server shift. (Any other sever can relate)   And the  \"once in a blue moon\" night they'd be packed, of course, would be on a Sunday night. He even apologized and comps food for long waits.

During the winter/spring time, you can grab a nice refreshing drink and make your way to the park festivals available at Indian Steele Park. My favorite drink to order is the cucumber vodka and soda. I think this is the only bar that has cucumber vodka, anytime I've asked for it elsewhere I get a crazy look.

    "text": "Great food every time, lots of lovely staff, a bit rough around the edges but if you want someone to wipe your mouth after each bite, don't go to an English pub.   Decor is warm and cozy, almost that if it's in the middle of London. Tons of seating, booths, tables, and bar seating available. They've even got a pool table for those with short attention spans while drinking. :)   The best thing about this place is, according to the Boyfriend, you can chat with locals or chill in a corner and enjoy the environment and not be bothered. Poker night on Wednesdays draws a bunch of old timer locals. Trivia night on Thursdays is apparently bustin at the seams, I'll be back to check that out too.   Drinks are rockin, food is excellent every time. What more could you ask for? It feels like home. Home sweet pub.",

My girl and I laughed our way through Sir Mix A Lot, only to have a world class karaoke-r go after us and put us to shame. Thursday is trivia, come early as it gets PACKED. Happy hour is from 4-7, $1 off all drinks, making a Jameson $4.95, hell ya. The bartenders are all friendly, make a strong drink, and are attentive. There's also a jukebox for you to pick your poison, darts, and pool tables.   Some of the best fish and chips around. The potato skins are a god send after drinking for 3 hours straight. Everyone who comes here seems to be a regular, gives off a legit English pub vibe.",

Everything I ordered was greasy, I never realized that fish and chips could be so greasy. I needed Tums to help my heartburn. Maybe order something less fried if you choose this spot? Can't say much else, the atmosphere was OK, a lot of happy, semi-drunk people at 3pm, makes me wonder where the designated drivers were hiding. Maybe everyone was bicycling, who knows?",

COMPLETELY worth the drive. Environment is so English Pub. Warm and welcoming, lots of interesting pieces to look at, and they definitely are serious about having a good time. :) Service was flawless! We enjoy asking staff what they'd eat/drink and Brooke absolutely delivered - we chose personalized black-and-tans (Guinness + Wyder's Pear and a Guinness + Big Blue Van from College Street Brewery)...and our food was KILLER. We ate one entree and it was so good, we took another one home to our foodie son. Chicken Curry Pastie. F A N T A S T I C. We will be back. The only reason it wasn't 5 stars is because the bathrooms weren't very clean.

Only giving this 4 out of 5 stars because 5 stars are reserved for Ruth Chris or Morton's Steakhouse.  Definitely recommend visiting!

Drunk or not, George and Dragon is an easily likable place!  The atmosphere is perfectly \"pubby\". Clearly, it's an English inspired watering hole. And they love their soccer, with all the banners, flags, scarves and televised games. (Kudos for also supporting Phoenix Rising!) What is surprising, is how good the kitchen is!  \"I'm craving some English cuisine tonight\", said no one ever. Look it up. It's not even an option on Yelp! While not popular, everyone knows what Fish & Chips is. As well as Shepherd's Pie or Bangers and Mash. The menu here is traditional English with good old American items too (burgers and wings). Plus, our server was quick, friendly and always available when needed.  George and Dragon is a fun alternative to the typical, boring offerings Phoenix has for 'grill and bar' type joints.  Throw in a distinctive menu with a kitchen that can execute food that is way better than traditional bar food, and you will understand why G&D has been around so long. And you can't believe everything you read on Yelp! Especially when their profile pic is a blurry shot of them with a monkey on their shoulder. (I'm looking at you Christian C.) Seriously dude?!",

We had the Fish and Chips, Sunday Roast and a sausage roll. The Roast was amazing! Unfortunately the Yorkshire pudding was over cooked, but the gravy and mash made up for it! The sausage roll was also really good! Unfortunately the fish was really greasy, but not the worst fried fish I've ever had. The waitress was not all that friendly. That was disappointing as many reviews state the people are engaging and part of their good experience. It wasn't very busy, so I was expecting a bit more friendliness.  We would definitely try again, since they have a True British menu and I want to try more from it.",

As I walk through the front entrance I am greeted with the smell of stale beer and a college party bar atmosphere (which was fine in my frat days and now not so much as a grown adult). It is spacious with a pool table on one side and lots of booths and high-tops.   With this being typed I proceeded to the bar where took up a stool and proceeded to order a pint of Boddingtons (two thumbs up). Kylie greeted me (she's the cat's meow btw) and was very cordial and helpful with the menu. I ordered the fish and chips. I then met Kylie's partner in crime for the evening: Cat/Kat? (She's the bees knees for the record) Also, very hospitable and a joy to be around.   The food came out and it was decent. It was about what I would have expected from a bar of this stature.  Not spectacular and not tragic.   It was trivia night and the natives were starting to get restless so I called it a night and wrangled back out the way that I came in.   Overall, this place is ok. I really want to like it and it's got to work on its general vibe. Five out of five stars to the staff though -- they were fantastic.",

From the outside, you could almost miss it and the parking lot in the rear might make you think it's the parking lot for another business.  The outside has a narrow dining patio that had a few patrons sitting with their dogs. Once inside, it doesn't look like a Phoenix area bar, but that is why you would chose a place like this.  Since we were a party of 6, we were seated in the adjoining dining room, away from the immediate bar area.  The waiter was very good in explaining the items on the menu and the drink choices. The menu has a lot to chose from, but when you come to an English pub, you order fish & chips.  The order came out within 10 minutes and the pieces of fish were generous, thick and flaky with a good crunch.  The \"chips\" were crunchy and flavorful too.  You won't leave hungry with these portions. When I make it back to the area, I hope to try the bangers and mash.",

But today my son and I stopped by for a quick brunch on a Saturday.   It's dark and dingy inside.  Just like many bars.  The bathroom is worse than many city park bathrooms.  Only use if really needed.  However, the servers were nice as could be and attentive.  The place has history and character.  The food was surprisingly great.  We had the fish and chips at around $13 which was two large, thick pieces of cod deep fried, over a nice pile of thick cut fries (chips) and the side of your choice (I wanted slaw, which was good).  Honestly, one of the better fish and chips I've had and a fair bargain compared to what many places charge nowadays for the same dish.  The second dish was the standout, however.  And that was the stuffed meatloaf.  I mean, it had a very \"adult\" sauce that was rich and spice, over a great pile of mashed potatoes, some cheese I think, and surrounded by perfectly cooked fresh green beans.  It was more than a typical adult can eat, so either share or be prepared to take some home.  But I mean... I don't order meatloaf that often, but this was about the best I've had.  Really tasty.  I think it was the sauce/gravy.  I'm sure the beers are great but I didn't try.  There are two big screens up, so a good place to go to watch a game I'd think.  Anyway, I'll be back for the meatloaf and will try a few beers then!",

Once we wedged our way into a parking spot, going in and finding a table was relatively easy.   The service was quick and kind. Our waitress was funny and attentive.

Kara was our server and she was friendly and got everything for us in a timely manner. I just had iced tea and an English dip. Fries were hot, flavor was great. A bit too much bun for the meat portion but overall, I enjoyed it. My dinner companion had a grilled cheese (not a hard order, but not on the menu) and was accommodated. She had one of their specialty drinks and liked that as well. Great food, great service= 5 stars!",

She was so phenomenal and took such great care of our group this morning. What the one-star post is for is the owner/management lacking a plan to service the entire restaurant. I could understand that happening it caught you off guard.....BUT you advertised the game/event on Facebook....this means you should have had plans a/b/c in place to take care of your customers. And if those plans fell through (which I can understand does happen occasionally) you should apologize to the customer and not send them a message saying they didn't read the end of the post.",

I dined here with three friends, and we split the bill two-ways. My companion put a generous tip for the whole bill on her half, so I didn't put a tip on my half of the bill. I authorized $74.87 to come out of my checking account. Two days later, a charge for $89.84 was pending. I called and spoke to the G&D manager, who told me he gets calls about this \"at least twice a week,\" and explained that \"some financial institutions\" add a tip to the preliminary charge, but that the extra $$ would \"fall off\" and not post to my account. First, I've been with the same bank for 17 years, and they've NEVER added a tip onto any of my bills. Second, a charge for $86.87 (more than $12 more than what I authorized) cleared for G&D yesterday. It didn't \"fall off,\" after all.   How can a restaurant be allowed to just add whatever they feel like to your bill for a tip? I used to love this place, and I still do. But now I know to bring cash to avoid a strange hassle.",

It is a local bar where you can let your hair down and relax! The atmosphere is great and the girls are pretty, both customers and wait staff! The food is great pub food! What more could anyone want from a bar? I haven't been disappointed yet, and I have been going there for at least 2 years. It isn't perfect... it's a bar. I'm looking to sit with my friends, have great conversation, drink a beer, eat good food, and look at girls. Isn't that what a bar is for?

I always preferred it's dingy, dive-likeness over the pretentious, lame Scottsdale bars near where I live. Sometimes I miss camping out on the patio in the back corner, chain smoking with friends and people watching but the George has lost it's charm for me. My purse was stolen the one and only time I didn't bring it with me to the bathroom. I did leave it with a group of dudes thinking it would be safe but no. I've seen three arrests out front. One time these junkie looking dudes were licking each other's hands in front of the patio until the cops came. I've seen a girl pee her pants INSIDE the bathroom and then proceed to slip on the sidewalk which was wet from the misters nearly cracking her head open. Many, many stories came from that place. My last visit was months ago and I couldn't wait to leave. It's just not fun anymore. So long, George.",

    "text": "Been meaning to try this place for years and finally had an opportunity. Unfortunately it was a huge let down. The first bad sign was that upon walking in every table table that wasn't occupied had not been cleared from the previous diners. During the 1 1/2 hrs (!!!) that we were here there were several tables that NEVER got cleared. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and another 45+ minutes until we received our food which was strange as no one else in the restaurant seemed to be ordering any food. There was a hair in the fish and chips (disgusting but mistakes happen), and the rest of the food was sub par at best.   Having lived half my life in England  I've been to plenty of pubs and also eaten plenty of mediocre pub food (none to my recollection as tasteless as this). However I would imagine that if you're trying to emulate a British Pub across the pond you would only want to bring over the best of the best, not the worst of the worst. Even the sad little mini frozen sausage rolls I had as a child were better. I'm a bit horrified that this is the \"taste of England\" that is being imposed on unsuspecting Arizonians who don't know any better.   I guess if you're just looking to knock back a pint or two and play pool and would only ever order food under the most drunk and dire of circumstances then you may enjoy this version of a pub. There certainly were a lot of regulars (not ordering food...).   P.S. I don't know if that greasy little man was a busser or a patron. If he was a patron he had no business going into the kitchen as many times as he did, or eating on the floor. If he was a busser then it would have been nice to see him clear more than one table he did. And I most certainly hope it was not his stringy long hair that we found in the fish and chips, although I wouldn't be surprised.",

A little eccentric, a little eclectic ... but hey, that's the British for you. The food was everything I'd grown up with ... cornish pasty ... roast beef and Yorkshire pud ... steak and kidney pie ... bangers and mash ... honest-to-god roast potatoes ... and for desserts, spotted dick and trifle. THIS was the life. We and our friends ate there often.   Gradually, over several years, G&D slipped downhill. Don't know why. I know light rail construction kept much of their business away for the years it went on, but the rot had set in some time before that. Favorite items began disappearing from the menu. The place became dingy, kind of unkempt. Ladywife and I had our last (pre-Bar Rescue) meal there about five years ago, and it was awful.   So some months after Bar Rescue we decided to go back and inspect. First and second, the menu was a surprise -- one back-and-front sheet in place of the old eight-page plastic-covered volume that would almost cover your whole table ... and stripped down to a bare minimum, with only a handful of items uniquely British any more.  Oh, well.   Still, the food we ordered was nicely prepared, served relatively promptly and with all the tastiness of the old days.  (Except for the peas ... they used to be EXCEPTIONAL. Now, they're what you'd get anyplace.)  We were happy. The place was packed,, and customers seemed happy. Chatting with David (the owner), *he* seemed happy.   Things are going well. G&D has been pleasantly revived, and we'll be back.   Btw, don't pay much attention to the negative reviews. It's a PUB, for Pete's sake, not Eddie Matney's. Cut them some slack -- the food is really good, the beer flows nicely, the service is what it is, and you should go.",

I know! Pretty wackadoo. But right away it felt like it had some history to it.   Love the big booths andthe service was great. The waitress was so friendly, but not in a so bubbly I'm going to vomit kind of way. The fried zucchini and sausage rolls were yummolicious. Cornish pasty was good. Yorkshire pudding. Not so good. It was almost solid. Yorkshire pudding is suppose to be puffed up and hollow. And it was in this yucky gravy. But I forgive them. You can't be too picky about English cuisine. But I will definitely come back to try the fish and chips.",

The service is always friendly and prompt, the crowd is always diverse, and the frequent weekend live music is a big plus.  I've felt sort of a rockabilly theme more often than not, but I have yet to make it there on a Wednesday, so I can't speak to anything but the weekend crowd.  I also heard its a good place to get some work done in the afternoon, as they offer wi-fi, too!  Cool, eh?  Pool and darts live here, too, as noted in previous reviews.

They have a great beer selection on both draft and by the bottle. As an added bonus, you can add a $1 shooter to your draft at any time. Food-wise, the Shepard's Pie is large and delicious - the perfect comfort food to accompany that pint. The fish and chips is another favorite of mine - the generous fillet is cooked just to the right crispiness.   The atmosphere is the real fun though, if you're into the whole English pub vibe. The place oozes Britain - from the flag painted on the bathroom ceiling to the tube sign tables. Plus the owner, David, is actually from Britain and mingles with the customers as if he was welcoming him into his own home. Be sure to check out the jukebox - it's one of the best I've seen!",

    "text": "Three stars might not seem like a rave review, but since I'm not a huge beer drinker, don't go to bars to watch sports, and prefer ethnic food over food from the Mother Land, three stars from me means that G&D is doing something right.   My husband and I met my uncle and aunt for dinner here on Labor Day. I was surprised that they were even open, and it was definitely slow because pretty much every server was standing outside smoking when we arrived. Not that I'm judging because as a former server, I can tell you that there's nothing worse than working a shift on a holiday, especially when it's more of a grilling-and-having-people-over type of holiday.   Anyway, we sat in the bar area in one of the extraordinarily comfortable booths. The booth directly faced the bar and was much more inviting than the somewhat closed-off dining area on the right. To drink, I had a Bloody Mary. I was pleased that our server asked how spicy I wanted it (since that meant it would be made from scratch) and even more pleased when I tasted it and found it to be delicious. You could really taste all the individual ingredients, including the oft-neglected horseradish, and it really hit the spot after a long weekend of drinking. I also tried my aunt's Long Island, and it was really good and not too sweet.   My husband and I split the \"English Dip\" and the Philly cheese steak. Neither was particularly good. I think we both erred in not ordering British classics because my uncle's Shepherd Pie was at least hearty and sort of the quintessential comfort food. My aunt's fish and chips was also decent, although she said it wasn't nearly as good as Rosie McCaffey's.   I am definitely not opposed to coming back here, especially for No Country Karaoke on Monday nights (does that mean I can't sing Martina McBride?). However, when I do return, I'm going to stick to drinking (I'll gladly have another of those Bloody Marys) and then after a few drinks, try one of the British pub dishes. After all, it's after a few drinks that carb-heavy and filling pub food really serves its True purpose.",

The crowd was tame and the setting was peaceful.  Ordered the Bangers and Mash.  It was good but the mash was dry without the gravy and they added peas to the plate which it didn't need.

A friend asked me to go on a Mon which is karaoke night. I don't inflict my terrible singing on others, but I did enjoy most of the other people singing.  I played a couple games of pool on 1 of the 2 tables while waiting for my food.  The main bartender was not a pleasant person. Words like \"sweetie\" don't disguise impatient, judgmental body language. I can't remember seeing her smile once. She made me uncomfortable. The other girls working there were smiley & nice looking. I also saw the general manager chilling outside.  Call me a cheap ass but I feel like I paid too much for fish & chips. Came out to $14.02. I expected to pay $10ish. I know it's market price & all but that still sucked. I should have asked the price before ordering.  The fish & chips were really good though. I could barely finish the 2 thick pieces of fish on my plate. They were perfectly crispy with just the right amount of batter. Chips could have been crispier though.  I LOVE THE COLESLAW! I can't say that enough. It wasn't sweet (yuck!) like other coleslaws I've tried. It was crisp & peppery. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Hmmm  When you order a shot I think you get more liqueur than just a shot because of their glasses. They're wide & the bartender wasn't measuring, she just eye balled it. Don't pay more ordering doubles since you're probably pretty much already getting that originally.  There are heaters above on the patio. Your top 1/2 will be warm while your bottom 1/2 might get cold.  There's 1 bathroom for girls. No stalls. If someone's in there you'll have to wait your turn. At least it wasn't filthy & smelly.",

That's great if what you are after is smelling like an ashtray after a meal of Shepherd's Pie.   The waitress that served me seemed a little brusque. Maybe that's part of the restaurant's \"charm\"?  The bathroom was in a transitory state of disrepair... or at least I hope it was transitory. I wasn't even sure if I was supposed to be in there.  Televisions are available for watching the soccer match and they have many types of beer on tap. I noticed a jukebox but didn't turn it on for fear of being pummeled severely by the other gruff-looking patrons while the soccer match was on.  This place has a little bit of an edge to it. If that's what you're into and you're just looking for a spot to grab a beer with a buddy, then check it out for sure. I'm not sure when or if I'll be back again, personally.",

    "text": "Jonathan E.'s review is spot-on. I went here for a late lunch on a Sunday and couldn't resist ordering the lamb. I was expecting a hearty hunk of roast leg of lamb, as the menu mentioned the Sunday Roasts selection. Instead, the meat was merely thin-shaved slices of lamb (with plenty of fat to trim away) with gravy. The sides were o.k., but overall this dish was disappointing.  If I must eat here again, I'll order the fish and chips, although I was a bit dismayed to see that malt vinegar was not brought automatically to the table. And although we submitted three orders of fish and chips, our server brought back two and had to be reminded that we were expecting a third. This meant everybody ate while one poor sod in our group had to wait patiently for his order to be placed (again). Fortunately, we split a Scotch egg as an appetizer and that tided him over, but it was not much of a treat.",

The Awesome Local Pub/ Football Hooligan bar atmosphere they provide, and the Owners and the the british expat company they keep who are characters in and of themselves.  the G&D is truly an experience.  Unfortunately on our last visit our waitress seemed to have horse blinders on, on several occasions we waved, we raised our hands, we yelled at her back and somehow she just didn't make eye contact or acknowledge that we were trying to get her attention.  despite somewhat unresponsive service we were still able to get drinks regularly enough throughout the night..  I also tried the food for the first time, it felt fitting to order the fish and chips, the chips are just steak fries with no memorable qualities,  however the fish was I believe cod, but the batter was very tasty and crispy, it was served with a side of coleslaw that wasn't bad either.  overall the atmosphere in this place is awesome, and the british expats that hang around the bar make it that much more convincing.  I'm confident that the incident we had with service was just that \"an incident\" and it's possible the waitress was just spread thin or stressed.  I'm confident our next visit will be fine, because I enjoy going to this bar.",

    "text": "Today I finally made it to George & Dragon.  I was in a pinch and looking for a place that had Telefutera so I could watch my favorite soccer team (Chicago Fire) play.  I called George & Dragon and was told they could accommodate.  One packed light rail ride later I was there and ready to get my game and drink on.  George & Dragon is my type of place.  The decor has been described by other Yelpers as very British.  Since I have not been the the UK, I cannot attest to that but it does look like what I think a British pub should look like.  It actually reminded me of the Winchester in Shaun of the Dead.  The football scarves are always a nice touch.  Perhaps one day I'll donate a USA or Fire scarf and see if they put it up among the UK clubs scarves.  The beer selection was not as good as I had hoped it would be but it's still better than most. Today I was in the mood to drink German despite being in a British pub so I opted to drink Spaten.    For lunch I ordered the Shepherds Pie and it was amazing.  It's the third different shepherds pie I've had in metro Phoenix and it might be the best one.  My team lost an ugly one and it spoiled my day a bit but I was happy to have made my first visit to George & Dragon.  It will not be my last.  With easy access to light rail I plan on being back soon.  Cheers!",

I don't even know where to start with this bad experience. We had 8 of us in our group. After about 15 mins we were finally waited on. The waitress started out to be great but I could tell she was getting flustered. I don't know if it was us or that she had too many tables or what but she was super slow with a bad attitude. Got our drinks to us fine. We ordered food. The fish and chips, some sausage dish, and the Scottish egg. Our food didn't arrive for 45 mins. I don't know about you but it does not take 45 mins for fish and chips. The best part about it was when she brought out our food, she informed us that they were out of Scottish eggs. We declined to getting something else because I was not waiting another 45 mins to eat. And overall the food sucked.   Now it's time to leave. She doesn't get our checks to us for about 20 mins. She asks what is on what check so we told her. She still got it wrong. She put an extra beer on my check and I told her this and she just stared at me and said \"oh, I guess you're paying for his beer.\" And shows no effort to take it off of my bill. She was just getting everything wrong. So she brings back our checks and everyone has there card except for my one friend. She somehow has lost his card. She scrummages around in her pockets and then precedes to look at other tables checks like someone would leave a credit card in their check. Well we finally found it. Thank goodness.   Honestly, for just being on bar rescue and \"remodeled\" this place needs some more work. Nothing against Jon Taffer. I'm sure he tried his best and this bar just went back to the way things were before he got there    So overall, my experience here was a nightmare. You will never catch me in that place again.",

Even then it wasn't all that great. Last time I wanted to order the French dip or English dip so badly but no one wanted to wait.   Tonight I'm sitting at home so hungry and pretty sick and wanted something other than McDonalds or filbertos so I call and ask when their kitchen closes and they told me 1230, I said thank you! And they just hung up. Rude . I called back and ordered food. I get there to pick it up and told me they actually didn't even have one of the items I had ordered and when I get home excited to eat my French dip.. There was not even any aju sauce for the sandwich. I went against the bad review for this sandwich because I thought the person was just complaining about every little thing.. But I too feel the same way.. No aju and it was not very good at all .. Probably will not be back.   Like I get it.. It's pub food but I have worked in many in the past that were better quality. Js..

The beer was nice and cold, the pastie was delicious!  The appetizer portion was more than enough to fill me up.  Our waitress was busy, but still attentive and gave us a sample of a few beers we questioned. The pricing for food and beer were very reasonable as well.",

    "text": "We stepped into this restaurant and it looked like what I'd imagine an British pub would be. The menu offers several different beer, wine, and liquor options, from several different regions of the world. Food options are a mix of American, Irish, and British pub type foods.  We started with the medium hot wing drumettes as an appetizer. They were the right amount of heat level- not too hot, not too mild. The sauce itself was very vinegary and the meat tasted a little on the dry side.  As for entrees, I decided on the fish and chips, and tried some of the shepherd's pie. The fish and chips came as 2 sizable pieces of battered fillets, with a heap of fries. Although I ordered it with peas, it came with an extra side of coleslaw. The batter was excellent on the fish: A beautiful golden brown, and very crisp. The fish though, tasted dry. The coleslaw was crisp, but had no flavor.   Service was somewhat lackluster. Although our server would take away plates, he did not bother to check on our table to refill drinks (Sodas). Even when asked if we could get a refill he forgot to go to our table until we were done with our meal, and by that time it didn't matter to us if we had refills. In addition, it took a long time to get our check.  I wasn't too impressed with the fish and chips, but I did like the shepherd's pie better. The mashed potatoes, ground meat, and veggies meshed well together with the gravy.   While I wasn't very impressed with the fish and chips, I'd like to give George and Dragon another shot. Maybe another item on the menu will be better on the palate!",

(like a razor scooter, but more awesome)  Lock that puppy up (again, bad*ss scooter reference here) on their bike rack, hop in with your pals for a late night clandestine meeting of the minds - at least that's what it'll seem like after a few of those $3.75 well drinks on a Friday at 9 or 10 pm, when in reality, it was just two or more buffoons boozing around making fools of themselves.  I'd say that I'm more a fan of neighborhood type bars than dance clubs, mostly because they tend to be lighter on the wallet than the latter. Call it a dive if you must, but I wouldn't classify George like that. Sure there's the obligatory pool tables and darts that make up a good dive. On any given evening, you might run into someone toting along their children for the 'grille' part of this bar and grille, but really, it's certainly more bar than grille by hefty proportions. I can't recall how many nights have ended at George, but you can rest assured that there will definitely be more.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, come meet George, he's kind of awesome.",

I can tell you that in the 30 minutes I was there last week I have not a clue what it was that bar rescue did for this place! Immediately upon walking in the door there is a very large framed menu on the wall with various signature cocktails one of which has gin and blueberries in it. It sounded very interesting! We made our way to the bar and service was very slow and the folks on either side of us were sitting there with empty drinks that they kept nudging closer and closer to the edge of the bar hoping to get someone's attention. When we were finally greeted I asked for the gin and blueberry drink and she told me that was a \"bar rescue drink\" and they no longer made it... So I politely responded that maybe they should take no longer available drinks off their oversized menu board everyone sees when you walk in the door. Anyway,  it was a very ordinary visit we ended up just having two cocktails on the patio and left. We did not want to lean our backs against anything outside as the place looked like it has been needing a power wash for the last 20 years. And finally here are some photos of the bathroom which not only was it grimy and gross but there was absolutely no air conditioning or circulation in there and it had to have been over 110. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one is because when we finally did get the bartender's attention she was apologetic and friendly and I thought the cocktails were reasonably priced for our call liquor.",

Servers were on point. If my glass was near empty, Jennifer had a full one coming. If I said I wanted another beer, she had it to me in less than 2 minutes. Food took a little bit of time, but that was because so many people were ordering at one time. Jennifer made sure to let us know that things were coming along and apologized for the wait because of the number of tickets. I never once felt like she had forgotten us. Even when I wanted to close out at the same time as half the restaurant, it was quick.  The food itself was very good. The mozzarella sticks were prepared perfectly. Actually some of the best I've had. Not too greasy and the cheese was perfect. The fish and chips were some of the best I've ever had - the fish, that is. They were very crispy, but not over cooked and not greasy. The chips (French fries) weren't my favorite as they were thicker than I prefer, but it didn't make me feel less appreciative about the dish.  I don't know what this place was like before the remodel, but I loved my first experience tonight. My party felt the same way and we'll be back.",

A female with long straight brown hair below her shoulders helped me with my order of a draft beer. She seemed pleasant enough and after handing her a twenty for a single draft beer, she handed me back my change in a weird way. It was folded with the ones showing. Quickly I peeled off a one and tipped her and went to a table. I had a strange feeling the way she handed my change back to me and finally after 5-10 minutes checked my change and in fact my intuition was correct. Instead of giving me $14 dollars back, she only gave me $4 dollars back. I sat there looking at $3. I went in with a twenty and was going to charge lunch on my Credit Card. I hope she chokes on the $10.00 she shorted me. Karma is a nasty thing, girl. I worked as a bartender for years and years. I know all the tricks and have finked on fellow employees for stealing and ripping people off. I ain't no rookie on the games one can play.",

They definitely changed it up for the bar area and feature more English dishes.  Tonight, I tried their Sausage Roll that came with Branson Pickle Sauce & Stoned Ground Mustard.  The roll was crispy and so flakey & the sausage was seasoned & cooked well.  Of course, I had to have their previously famous fish (COD) & chips.  Just as good as before, but instead of one big piece, the cut in half and deep fried to golden perfection and not greasy.  Naturally, best with Malt Vinegar on everything!!!  Highly recommend if in the area.",

Obviously these food items come some factory some where. This is a dangerous and unhelpful bar and grill in my experience.  Having just traveled in Great Britain I find this establishment an insult to Queen and Country. The men's restroom had a broken urinal, graffiti on the walls, and urine on the floor.

While the vibe was young and friendly, we didn't feel comfortable at all.  Then again, I never hung out in bars when I was younger, and neither did my Mom.  After trying out a couple restaurants' fish and chips, she definitely favors George & Dragon's (everything from the perfectly light, yet tasty batter, the best hand-cut steak fries, and tartar sauce she couldn't get enough of... don't forget the malt vinegar!), but laments on not being able to go back.  ..and thus continues our quest for a great fish and chips meal served in a great setting.  Any reco's?  We've been to McCormick and Schmick's and Rula Bula; both weren't good enough for her.  Please, no fast food chains like Long John Silver's, Pete's Fish and Chips, and similar spots (my terms, not hers as she LOVES LJS).",

I LOVE trivia with useless factoids, so I felt right at home. 40 questions really tries the useless knowledge portion of the brain. Which in my case is most of it. Unfortunately I was already a little sauced and was 3 more beers deep by the time we were done. It was a great time, including war paint. We scored 28 out of 40. I am going back soon to redeem myself. Georgie S, are you down?  We also created a new game that works when Nikki F is there.  If she starts to fall asleep, someone says her name and then rest of the table, in unison, must yell her name again.  Good clean fun!  I like the decor. There are authentic European football jerseys and scarves all over the place. Rugby too.   A couple of side notes. 1 star deduction for, what I am guessing was a manager, coming over and telling us we were being too loud and disruptive. WTF?!!! We are in an English pub, with a lot of beer, drunk people, playing a competitive trivia game. Are you serious!? I was dumb founded and I think I may have talked back to this dude. Couldn't believe it.   I have started my \"Slay the Dragon\" card. Only 61 more beers to earn my shirt. Starting to train now.   Sorry for the pic post Nathan S, I had too.",

The food was just what she described. She always was there at the right time and anticipated our next need.  FOOD: It came out piping hot (which is a must for me). The unique combinations of flavors were prepared and presented perfectly. We had fish and chips, fish tacos, and meatloaf (the best ever). All home made and outstanding!

We took the lightrail downtown for a Rattlers game and afterwards hit G&D for a drink and snacks afterwards.   It was really busy because of the hockey game being on so we couldn't find anywhere to sit in the bar area or even get to the bar to order a drink... so we found a table tucked in the corner in the \"restaurant\" side... only probably here was service.. no one cared about those eating food!    We only had about 10 mins to look at a menu and order before the kitchen closed at 11 so we had to track down a waitress to take our order.  Menu for food was quite typical.  Fish Sandwich, Burgers, etc.  Friends enjoyed it.. but also had a few beers in, so I cant say its more than any other \"bar food\"  I only ordered the chips and salsa which were less than adequate... straight from the store, nothing special at all.    I think this place could have been a lot better if we had better service and were in the bar area which is clearly the \"cool\" part.",

    "text": "The G&D captures most of what an English pub is all about - to a great enough extent that I have actually forgotten I am in Phoenix when in there on occasion.  There are some excellent beers on tap, including Abbott's Ale, IMO the best beer one can obtain in Phoenix.  The English Sunday Lunch is authentic and pretty good. I won't say excellent as I cook better, but for somewhere out it is more than good enough and on a par with pubs back home - and at a VERY reasonable price.  The Cornish pasties and Shepherd's Pie are 'ok', but not as seasoned as I like or cook - but a safer bet to appeal to the masses / American palettes...  Dave the owner is a very nice chap and always friendly and willing to talk to people when he is there as is his brother who is often found serving behind the bar.  All in all a very worthwhile place to snag a bite to eat and a pint - and play pool, darts or watch soccer on TV if they take your fancy.",

The pasty is top notch as well (don't forget the Branston Pickle with it). They have a vast selection of scotch, ales, and stouts so there is something behind the bar to appeal to just about everyone. The crowd is varied and usually a good time to be had by all.  Mellow during the day and up-beat late at night. There is a reason that this pub has remained one of my favorites throughout the years.",

    "text": "I really hate to give this place a less than stellar review because I want to like it so badly! The location is great, far enough out of downtown to avoid the clutter and close enough to have train access and feel like you're in a more urban area. Big family style benches allow for friend-making outside and individual tables inside. I'm surprised I came back after the first time. On a busier night, we couldn't get service to save our lives. We made sure we weren't stepping on toes by seating ourselves and sat, staring at servers running AROUND us for 15 minutes before going to the bar and begrudgingly ordering a beer from there instead. We sat and tried to shake it off while drinking one of many draft choices and waited, trying to make any contact with a server so we could get a menu or so I could merely ask where the bathroom was at-but nothing. I even timed how long it would take to get any attention without waving my arms around and after 10 more minutes we gave up. Apparently we were also given up on because the only interaction we had was the server rudely ripping our drink menu off the table without a word! That being the last straw, our feelings a little hurt, and trying to dial down why we felt like we were refused service, we left half full beers and walked out upset. I still over analyze the situation and try and figure out what in the hell we did wrong!  Now, we came back to meet with friends almost a year later and service was slightly more decent. For mediocre bar food and bare minimum service that I usually have to flag down or jump straight to the bar for. I don't see all the hype in my own personal experience and that totally bums me out given that I like the atmosphere and location so much and so do many of my friends/coworkers. We still go here out of convenience and a quick beer occasionally but I can't seem to get the bad taste out if my mouth. Bummersville.",

    "text": "I've been coming here every Thursday with friends for Trivia Night for probably a year and a half now. Even though I'm a regular, I've only had the food here a handful of times, so I can't really offer too much insight in that aspect. However, I can tell you that the experience you get at G&D is superb. From the time I first started coming up until now, I've had several different waitresses--all of whom are super friendly and provide great service. Our current waitress, Ashley, have already memorized our regular drink orders. I always get a hot tea with lots of extra lemons and some extra napkins, and she never fails to get all of that to me as soon as we are seated. Trivia nights are amazingly fun. Even though we're a group of young girls competing against 40 or 50-year old men who knows every obscure fact on the face of this planet, it's still great to test your knowledge and learn some random new information you might not have known before. For example, I now have it ingrained in my brain that \"Nights in White Satin\" is by The Moody Blues (as they've asked that question more than a couple times in past trivia nights...).  David, the owner of G&D is a great guy who's very personable. He comes around to each table and chats with different groups, and sometimes offers hints to questions if he doesn't consider you to be a \"wanker\" (a term he often uses to call out the really obnoxious customers). He also tells a couple of dirty or \"offensive\" jokes every Thursday, all in good fun!  One more thing...the bathroom toilet seat covers have the British flag on them! It's pretty cool. Also I heard that the women's bathroom in the back is haunted, but the scariest thing I've ever seen in there so far was only a cockroach, so I'm not sure how accurate that rumor is.  I love G&D because it's not at all pretentious. It's just a comfortable place where you can come hang out, relax, enjoy a few drinks with friends, chat and play games. It's got its little quirks, but that's what I love about it, and when I walk in I feel completely at home. :)",

Shadow, the main character, described them as real stick-to-your-ribs food with an astonishing filling, \"a savory delight wrapped in hot pastry.\"   Every pasty I've ever had has been rather disappointing and never quite lived up to the expectations Gaiman set up for his readers.   But I've found it here!   For $10 and some change, you can get a delicious, flaky-crusted pasty with an amazing meat and carrot filling, mashed potatoes, and succulent peas, and it's WORTH EVERY PENNY.   And I enjoyed this long-sought meal with a can of Strongbow cider.   Without exaggeration, this was one of the greatest meals I've ever had. Proof positive that \"bar food\" can be top quality.  Furthermore, the place is cool. It's like the local hang-out where everyone seems to know each other and they welcome newcomers. I love it.",

    "text": "The biggest challenge here is getting your hands on a drink menu. IF, and I mean IF, you are able to obtain one of the elusive drink menus you are in for a treat.  George and Dragon is really different than other local bars and pubs. It's owned by a True Brit with a real cockney accent and run by a bunch of tatted up punk rock looking girls. The contrast of the football flags and the Camden town style of the wait staff makes the atmosphere interesting.   There is a good crowd at the bar. Except for the usual few a-holes you find in every bar, The G & D is patronized by hipsters and business men alike. Families eating bangers and mash sit seats away from rowdy college kids. Stock brokers drink ale next to drunkards slamming whiskey and stylish career gals drinking cosmos. It's a unique mix rarely found in Arizona.  The food is pretty good too. English food is by definition terrible. I lived in Cambridge for a few months and found it hard to digest most traditional English fare, but G & D does a good mix of American classics and British favorites. Even the cold egg thing that my boyfriend loves (and I hate) seems to be a hit with most patrons.  George and Dragon is a great place to meet with friends, have happy hour with co-workers or sit alone and stew. Either way you should have a good time in this gem of a pub.   Don't forget to try the fried pickles!",

    "text": "Being born in the UK to a long line of English, Welsh, Irish and Scots, so there's nothing more I'd like than for a good Brit pub to thrive in PHX.  That said, this place has the bones and makes an attempt, but falls short.   It's kinda divey, but that's fine.  The beer selection is great.  The crowd is diverse.  Good music, lots of sports on the TV, etc.  On the flip side:  The staff has good intentions, but is not well trained.  They do the job, but don't anticipate - you have to ask.  They don't seem empowered.  We ordered some happy hour food at 6:55, for example, and they said it was over.  It wasn't 7, but they explained the \"computers\" made the call.  This wasn't something we brought up at 10 p.m. - but before it was 7!   A guy next to us ordered food to go and sat there for 40 minutes.  He kept asking and the response was \"it wasn't up\" but then he got mad and it magically appeared all boxed and ready.  Bottom line:  service is o.k. for a bar, but the food thing seems to flummox them.  The menu covers a wide range of bases, but also is a series of hits and misses.  We went one weekend for the Sunday Roast.  It was a generous plate of veggies, mash and a massive yorkshire pud.  But the beef wasn't roast anything... more like steak-ums.  The gravy was from a can/jar.   Now some might say this is trivial, but a good Sunday Roast Beef meal to the English is like a Thanksgiving dinner in the US.  You can't serve shaved turkey from a frozen bag and surround it with good sides... the main dish needs to be lovingly prepared.  On another night, the Scotch eggs followed the same theme.  A great idea.  The dish was served with a wide range of extras, but the core food was odd.  Not bad, but the casing was an inch thick and dry.  I'd love to see this place work.  They offer a menu of what should be made, but just don't quite deliver a good food product.  To be fair, the market might not support it and are happy with ho hum stuff, but on the flip side I've enjoyed much more inspired fare in CA - not just the U.K.",

When I looked at my watch, and saw that half-an-hour had gone by without anyone EVER coming within 6ft. of my table -- much less asking if I wanted to order anything -- food or booze or coffee or a glass of water -- nobody.  Nothing.  I simply got up and walked out.  When I go to a restaurant, I do NOT beg for service.  I expect someone to come to my table and ask me if I want something.  They didn't do that.

George and Dragon it was. The patio is long but narrow with only a handful of round tables on it. However, it's still a nice place to sit with a beer and chat. After a drink on the patio, we headed inside for our next round and decided to just cozy up to the bar. The inside decor is not going to wow you at all, but I appreciate the amount of TVs they have near the bar, showing everything from women's college basketball to English Premier League soccer. I'm also a big fan of bar sports, so the pool table and dart boards in the back get a thumbs up from me as well.  The draft beer selection is large...probably the largest of any of the pubs I have visited in the Valley. I believe it was about $4.75 for a pint, which is slightly cheaper than pubs like Rula Bula. The menu runs the gammet from traditional British fare to very Americanized food with very very moderate prices. Chris had a fish sandwich which he enjoyed and I had a BLT which I requested with no mayo. However, more than half way into the sandwich I realized there was mayo on it! This shocked me because normally I can always detect mayo on sandwiches as I hate it so much...so I'm not sure what G&D did, but they snuck mayo past me and I still loved the sandwich! The fries that came with the sandwiches were tasty. Our bill  (before tip) after five pints of beer, an appetizer, and two sandwiches came to $40.  The two bartenders that waited on us were incredibly friendly and quick. From the signs I saw inside, it looks like Sunday-Thursday, they do a reverse happy hour starting at 11 pm with 2 for 1 well drinks. I love the laid back vibe of G&D and the booths look comfy, so I will be back.",

But now, it's 2007 and the smokers have been banished to the outdoors. Gooooooaaaaaaaaallllll! That means I can hang out at the George and watch quality soccer since I'm too cheap to spring for Gol TV at home. Plus I don't have a bartender firing off hysterical commentary at home.   The shepherd's pie isn't bad, either. But if you're in the mood for a Cornish pasty, go to The Cornish Pasty Company in Tempe. They don't play the soccer games, but you stand a good chance of hearing some Iron Maiden blaring over the speakers!  Back to the George, I think we've covered it all. Now just wait 'til that blasted construction is finished...",

    "text": "I first fell in love with George & Dragon during World Cup 2002. On the night Brazil defeated England, the patrons actually lifted the one man with a Brazil jersey into the air and carried him to the back door.  People often think G&D has overpriced drinks. It really doesn't. Last night, I bought $8 rounds of vodka tonic and Smithwick's pints. I don't know how the price was split, exactly, but $4 for either drink is decent.  Monday's No Country Karaoke isn't much different from your average karaoke night, but a few genuinely talented crooners do show up, and the wireless mike makes the whole pub a stage.  G&D's business has slowed because of light-rail construction on Central, but the fun factor still is there. I've never had a bad time. If singing and drinking isn't your thing, pool tables line one side of the pub. Also, a fenced outdoor patio allows smokers to have a puff while keeping their drinks in hand. Bravo.",

Also, a late night menu of home-cooked food... which is actually delicious!! The outdoor patio is a nice addition, especially for socializing and smoking!  Really, the only decent place to hang out in the NorthCentral Phoenix area.",

    "text": "I love the \"no apologies\" approach of George and Dragon.  I've been going to this bar for almost 8 years (which is a lifetime in PHX), and not even the scent has changed (despite being smoke-free, for what, like 2 years)  Its like the Binion's Horseshoe of Phoenix pubs.    Classic.  Comfortable. Cocksure.   Vile.  Smarmy.  Ruddy.  Everything a British Pub should be -- complete with Smithwick's and Fish/Chips.  Their music is tip-top, and though it doesn't exist anymore, I was highly, HIGHLY impressed by their Northern Soul night on Wednesdays.  I mean, holy smokes, what a freaking stunt!  Too bad it couldn't maintain.  Either way, you've got the EPL on Saturdays and Sundays, so this appeases the loss of midweek, underground Motown.  And as an aside, this place is mos def in my Top 5 of places that need to have the smoking ban recanted.  Yes, i have a list.",

On Saturday nights they sometimes have a band on the tiny stage--that part could use some work. However the atmosphere is great and a bit like an English pub, although much bigger of course, there is another huge dining room that rarely gets used and lots of flags of the different counties and sports teams of England. Long Live the Queen!!!",

They have great comfort food, fresh vegetables (which are hard tom find even in upscale places) and it's got the classic pub feel, not the American \"pub\" feel, if you know what I mean. The only down side is that the wait staff/bartenders are hit or miss, the ones that are a hit are fantastic and genuinely friendly, but the ones that are a miss are LAME! Terrific place for groups also.",

    "text": "This bar is not for everyone, and its location leaves much to be desired... however, I can't help but love this place. It's a little bit of a trek for me, so I don't go very often - however, I do try to go as much as I can.   When smoking was allowed, this place was difficult to breathe in. Now it's much nicer. The food is delicious I think, but I've had friends tell me they weren't so pleased... most people I talk to though seem to like it. There are booths that seat about 5 people. The seats are high and make it somewhat private. The bar is huge and they have waitstaff, so it's fairly easy to get a drink usually. It's also seldom crowded which is nice.   They host their own free poker nights with prizes... there's also pool, darts, and plenty of televisions to watch soccer on. G&D could use a bit of a facelift, but it's holding up well. The waitresses and bartenders are pretty hot and look like they could be suicide girls. There's usually someone good looking in there - but no pressure to be good looking or dressed up yourself. It's very casual. The place has a bit of a punky edge to it - most of the regulars seem to be into that. If that's \"your people\" then you should go check it out. If these aren't your people and you want to check it out - don't feel intimidated... everyone there is pretty nice. I should also mention that there's lots of beer on tap and the mixed drinks are usually really strong.  I'm realizing now that I need to come up with a formula for my reviews so they are more uniform and aren't so chaotic. Basically, G&D is a good place to go for a British Pub experience in the valley, but it's really more of a neighborhood bar full of regulars than a hot spot. Totally worth checking out though.",
