I stop by every time I am going out in old town on the weekends, plus other times when I am in the area. (There is always a long line in the weekends after midnight. They stay open every day until 4am). The pizza and the service have always been great. It has way better pizza than most other pizzerias I have tried in the Phoenix metro area. This is the go-to place in old town Scottsdale. Keep up the great work.",

In the indiscriminate hours of 2-4 am, you can dine by the slice, or if you gotta have it fresh like yours truly then reject the premade meal and get yours made-to-order.  $20 for an 18\" with two toppings is a bit pricey by some standards, but after shooting Patron all night like a rich bitch I could overlook it. They're busting out the dough and making my pie FRESH in the middle of the night, so tip them well. Crust is legit, cheese is REAL, stringy mozzarella. Staff is kind and quick; the manager keeps the young guys running around, working hard. This pizza is quality hangover protection.",

My boyfriend and I stopped by Joe's with our friends after going to the nearby bar. We picked up a slice of cheese and a slice of margherita pizza to go. Everything seemed fine until we got home and looked more closely at the margherita pizza. We're pretty sure that instead of basil, it had spinach on it. I've never had a margherita pizza with spinach instead of basil so we're wondering if it was a mistake. I suppose the two green leaves look somewhat similar. And I'm assuming it was supposed to be margherita pizza. That's what we ordered and no one corrected us.  Aside from that misstep, everything else was good. The cheese pizza was delicious, especially topped with a bit of parmesan cheese and garlic. If only we had only gotten the cheese, this may have been a five star stop.",

They make their money off serving the after clubbing drunk crowd who just want the closest food. Someone needs to tell the counter employees to treat people who come in there on a Wednesday afternoon with appreciation & respect.   A strange non-feature is that there's no iced tea. No sweet, unsweet brewed, or fountain tea. Also not a large selection of fountain drinks and one of the flavors was not working.   The veggie sandwich was really good (see pic.) Thats the only positive thing I can say about Joes.   Got an order of cheese fries and they were disgusting! The fries were soggy with no seasoning. Don't know what kind of cheese was melted on them but it wasn't good either (see pic)  The only reason I didn't try the pizza was that it had flies all over all the pizzas and the employees clearly didn't care. Since they leave the doors open the small, crowded restaurant has many flies all over you food.   Even after the next time I leave the club in search of munchies one night I will NOT be going to Joes.",

For some reason pizza seems like the easiest thing in the world to make but these guys missed the mark on most everything. It arrives in a giant square, the crust is like a massive piece of tasteless focaccia bread. Sauce tasted like watered down Campbell's soup...no seasoning that I could detect whatsoever.  We basically ended up eating the cheese off of it. The good thing is that it will feed a family of six no worries because it weighs about 50 pounds. It was cool to be able to order right off yelp, and they came exactly when they said they would.  That's why I have them 2 stars.",

There aren't that many places in Scottsdale (even in this gritty urban jungle where I live, called Old Town), to walk over and get a slice at lunch. That's all I've ever had at Joe's...I know they have sandwiches, calzones, spaghetti, etc., but I just wanted a slice. I will have to try the other stuff one of these days (so many places, so little time). Joe's does good job. It's not Manhattan, but a slice here will fill you up. They do a good job with toppings, and the cheese to sauce to toppings to grease ratio is just right (the pizza creases up just right for eating). If you ask them to make your slice well done, they leave it in the oven for a little extra time and that gives the crust a little more crunch, for those of us that like that sort of thing. Nice people behind the counter and the place is clean, has a few tables outside for sitting and eating on nice days. And, finally, a big slice of pizza and drink only sets you back about $4.50. It's good, cheap eats for lunch!",

The pizza is starting to grow on me and now I look forward to grabbing a slice from Joe's because gosh darnit it really is pretty tasty! As for the garlic knots, well those didnt get any tastier after a second try but this place is still worth going to just for the delicious, nearly perfect new york style pizza. They also have the famous east coast tasty cake products that they sell individually for only a dollar! Definetely adds to the allure of the pizza when you know you can get a tasty cake to finish off your meal! Second Overall I give this place a \"Mmmmm, tasty cheese pizza tastes yummy and make my tummy happy\"",

An hour and a half later I call and ask where the pizza is, they say the delivery driver is on the way. One hour later, no pizza, I call the store and its closed.  So that was crappy enough, but today I called joe's new york pizza to talk to the manager about it. The owner is was there, the employee I was talking to on the phone relayed to me that \"since I was paying cash there's nothing to do.\" I said- \"yeah what about me waiting 2.5 hours for nothing and you failing to deliver?\" I asked to speak to the owner, apparently he was too busy.  I told the employee if he refused to talk to me I would just leave a negative review, and that I'd rather not to do that. The relayed to me that he didn't care. WOW!   The owner of this company DOES NOT CARE about their business. Truly I'm amazed, one of the worst customer service experiences I've seen-- and from an owner!",

Chicken wings, Mozz sticks etc. I cant speak for anything else than the tasteless Pizza and their marinara is equally as bad no cheese whatsoever and sausage was horrid.

Actually, no...it was pretty flavorless even when we reheated it.  A single pizza with a side of Mac and cheese $40 plus a tip.  The Mac and cheese was literally a few noodles and some watery cheese sauce.  VERY Gross.    It seems that many of the positive reviews are from post-party people. I get that.  With enough alcohol anything can pass as good food.  But don't try this garbage sober. You'll wish you were drunk.   Absolutely NOT worth it.  Also, could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers?  Apparently that would have been too great a cost for them to spare a single pack of Parmesan cheese.    I have no problem paying a premium for really good food.  Not the case here.  It is sad when I wish I had ordered cardboard dominos instead -- it would have tasted better and cost half as much.",

They told us we were wrong and had only been there for ten minutes and to wait. Another 20 minutes passes and we ask again, Guy couldnt remember our order and just gave us the pizza out on the tray, and then our now cold all HOT wings, which was not what we had order. Horribly horribly rude, mean, awful service. Hour long wait for cold wings and mediocre pizza. Just save yourself and go to little ceasars, or ANYWHERE else.

Said about 35 minutes, took an hour.  Cheese was stuck to the box lid and the pizza was not even warm.  Not that the price was an issue, but for a cold pizza, it was not worth it at all.  It was as if they used very little cheese, barely had 2 pepperoni's per slice, if lucky.

As a transplant from the Northeast, Joe's satisfies my desire for decent New York-style pizza (and associated items like chicken rolls and garlic knots) in a metropolitan area that is largely devoid of high-quality \"by the slice\" pizza joints. I have visited both during the daytime and evening and have always found the service efficient and friendly.  If one has experienced less than stellar service at 2 AM, than maybe one should consider why he or she is getting that service. To borrow the lyrics of the New Radicals, \"you only get what you give.\" If I had to deal with some of the Scottsdale populace at 2 AM while in a state of exhaustion in a kitchen where the temperature is in excess of 100 degrees, I might be a little cranky too about having to deal with drunk antics.  I only wish there was a Joe's closer to downtown Phoenix. What this restaurant does is so easy! Why can't more Valley pizza restaurants do it? I guess we'll never know...",

    "text": "This place has decent pizza but it is REALLY greasy.  I always have to dab the grease off before I eat it.  I order cheese most of the time, I ordered onion and green peppers once and the pizza came... It looked like an onion festival was underway... I could see a few green peppers and barely any cheese due to the enormous amount of onions piled up.  I was not happy.  I called next time and asked if they could do a third of the normal toppings, told the lady on the phone my onion story to explain, she proceeded to laugh at me and say \"That was me! I looovvvveee onions! Hahaha!\" Really?? She didn't even offer to give me a free topping or anything.  It was odd.  Other than that for delivery they are very fast, and stay open the latest in the area.  The chocolate cake is disappointing.  It is that same frozen layer cake I used to thaw out when I was a server at a spot in college.  I usually order it and microwave it for a bit then eat it, much better that way!  Really if this place used better quality ingredients and fresh vs. frozen items they would be 5 star....  Don't order the cheese sticks, they are not pizza style, they are fried mozzarella and gross by the time you get them.  Hell, those things are only good fresh out of the frier anyway...go with the garlic bread, it's solid.",

Great for a quick lunch if your work in the area. Also it's another great end of the night meal if your at the bars/clubs in Old Town, there is usually a lot of people when the clubs close but guys it gives you one last shot to spit game when you failed all night on the dance floor.",

Second, the prices were way too much to begin with, nevermind when you call. Third, the pizza arrived very late and I was starving so I begrudgingly accepted... And regretted it. Fourth, it tasted like a foot wrapped in a cardboard. I'm no pizza snob, and I hate this place and the pizza. Do yourself a favor and eat the drywall instead.",

Sorry if that's too much for you to take on. Obviously McDonald's holds a higher standard for late night dining. I manage a restaurant . Minimum orders suck, but so do minimum restaurant sales.

I get a slight whiff of the pepperoni and sausage pie he's holding in his right arm and deja Vu rushes over me as I start to get hungry again. However, I still say no thanks and he mumbles and grumbles as he walks away looking like he wants to shove that pie right in my face .

Ive have been a loyal customers of Joe's for years now as its in our neighborhood and have always had such good service and amazing pizza...I ordered their pizza weekly! Ive always loved their greasy large super cheesy pizza. Ive noticed the last few times i have ordered the pizza was horrible, cheese was falling off everywhere, so much sauce or its not even NY Style. Tonight just really ruined it for me. I ordered my pizza and left in the comments to add ranch and buffalo. Our pizza arrived almost an hour later after the delivery man who didn't speak such good english called me 20 minutes prior to arriving asking where my exact place of residence was, i literally live 7 minutes at most from the store. When he got here, even though it stated on the receipt when delivered about the sauces the driver looked at me clueless when i asked where the sauces were. He just said its not on the receipt when it clearly states so. I sit down to eat and open up the box and the pizza is ICE COLD. Literally stale at this point. I called them to complain and was HUNG UP ON 4 TIMES IN A ROW. Horrible customer service. After calling back the woman who has an accent had a rude tone. I was transferred to the store after 20 minutes of being hung up on and being on hold numerous times. I was told the manager was to contact me tomorrow to resolve this. Its just really disappointing to see how downhill Joe's has gone in the last few months, it almost seems like its under new ownership or management because instead of calling the store directly your sent to an outbound office. I definitely wont be spending anymore money here and sadly have to find a new neighborhood pizza spot of my liking.",

They also delivered...score! So I ordered three larger pepperoni pizzas for our gang and said they would be there in about 45 minutes. No biggie!  The pizzas arrived before we knew it and we quickly devoured them. It's definitely not the best pizza I've ever had but it did the job and soaked up all that alcohol, haha. It was pretty expensive for pizza but I wasn't going to complain about that, we were hungry!  Thanks for dealing with a bunch of drunkies at 2:30 a.m. Joe's NY Pizza...much appreciated!",

He said \"Oh, well our fax machine is broke.\"   He asked if i still wanted the order and judging by his manner, I said no and that i would like a refund.  He asked me what website did I place the order on, he has no record of it and he needs to call me back.  Then he hung up on me and I am out 25.00!!!!  Will NEVER give this place another chance.  Our work location is pretty close to Joe's, and they will not be receiving future business from us.",

Of the six picky eaters in the office, everyone liked the food. The pizzas are huge with thin, slightly chewy crust, plentiful toppings, and just the right amount of grease. I didn't try the Stromboli personally, but my boss who is born-and-raised New Yorker said it was the best Stromboli she's had in Arizona so that is saying something.  The canolis were very tasty - not too sweet and small enough that you can eat one without feeling terribly guilty.  This is definitely a place we will be getting delivery from again.",

It was definitely not what was pictured on the menu. The price was 11.99. no fries, no pickle (as shown).  Basically a rip off (Subway would have been better for the price)   The chick parm was way overcooked. Generous portion, but not very good. I think we are done with Joe's.",

I put out appetizers and made a couple of salads, but how can you host approximately 20 people and not serve pizza for a kid's birthday party?!    I used the Eat 24 App and ordered that afternoon.  I love the feature that you can select a later delivery time.  I selected 5pm and ordered the following: -Vegetable Pizza + eggplant (highly recommend adding that eggplant; it was awesome!) -Meat Pizza -Plain Thin Crust 20\" Pizza -40 Wings - (Buffalo style with ranch)  I was able to add tip to my order when I placed it so I didn't have to worry about tipping the delivery guy.  Everything arrived on time and hot... and was demolished by my guests.  I had a slice and more than a few wings as well, and it was worth the calorie splurge for sure!  So, bottom line is that Joe's is great for lunch, for delivery, and for late night bites as well.  I'll definitely be back soon!",

The pizza is a very thin crust thin cheese ny style. I recommend going to Gus Pizza across from them because their service is much better.  I ordered pick up via yelp eat24 and when I came in after my order status was done it was full 1 topping and not half and half like I ordered. I pointed this out and the cashier \"Isarel\" (older tan) said it was my order. I had to read the order (2nd half pep) to him 3x to get him to believe me. Also didn't believe me I had 2 side sauces and it's also on the order... They took a cheese and added pepperoni to it... Guess someone else's order will be late. I told them not to rush it and undercook it and it's undercooked yep hope I don't get food poisoning.  I then said can I get anything for having to wait? He said no and Joe the owner, would also say no and refused to give me his public owners contact info to ask. Joe came in as I was waiting btw and he didn't say anything. Told me to come back tomorrow 9 to 2 to talk to Joe. I asked again can I get a water bottle, a drink, garlic knots or a coupon for next time! I was settling for coupons that he HAD IN A DRAW fam! He had them! Refused to give me anything for their error.  Joe is there 9a to 2p allegedly if any of you want to talk to him.  I'm shocked and appalled this inconsiderate behavior has not shut them down with the BBB. This is not the first time Joes messed up my order, overcharged me, tried to double charge me or was downright rude. If you believe in the moral good don't go to Joes and maybe they'll get the message to CARE ABOUT PEOPLE WHO GIVE THEM MONEY.",

The place is filled with NYC memorabilia from various teams. The woman who runs it seems like a typical no-nonsense New Yorker, so if that's not your style, fa-get-bout-it! Go somewhere else. The pizza is incredible and it is consistent in its recipe. Very important! And yes, they do stay open late. Some have complained about the different prices from regular hours compared to midnight and beyond. To me, it makes sense. If people want to eat pizza at 2:30 am, be prepared to pay a lot more for it. Its the big-city way. Someones gotta pay for the employees to hang around all night. In short, get yourself over to Joe's Pizza. Try it plain or Hawaiian style. This is REAL New York Style pizza all the way.",

When I called from a different number, the man who answered the phone sounded drunk and could not give me any definite answer about the status of my order, after wasting my time he said he couldn't find the order and then hung up on me. After calling AGAIN at 2:40 they said that the order has JUST printed. I asked if they would comp it for me and they said no but said they could give me some free food, so I asked for a free pizza. When the order finally arrived over 2 hours after I ordered it the driver didn't even ask for a signature, and I got no receipt. The \"free pizza\" was 3 nasty slices they just threw into a box. I was so unsatisfied, I would have cancelled my order from the beginning but since I placed it online it had already ran my card and they refused remove the charge. I will NEVER give this place my business again! I understand deliveries take longer but the amount of time I had to wait was insane, especially since they could not clarify the problem. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE THEY SUCK!",

    "text": "Good late night spot for some pizza after hitting up the clubs in Old Town. We came here after going out this weekend for some good old fashion late night food. There was a constant flow of people coming and leaving. They have a good selection of pizzas ready to heat up and serve to you. I dont know if this is a place Id go to on the regular but its definitely the late night joint.  Also, I thought it was kind of interesting because there was a cop standing inside the restaurant keeping an eye on things. I assume things can get rowdy in a place like this considering that everyone there after the bars is pretty sauced. I guess it's the norm but not something Im used to seeing.",

Unfortunately, we called up for delivery and were told that it would be 45 minutes for a Grandma Pizza, garlic bread and a Caesar salad. The food was delivered after 1 hour and 45 minutes. We called them multiple times and were told that it would be \"just a few minutes\". Finally on the third call we asked for a refund and were told that they couldn't do refunds unless the manager was there. Apparently the ONLY manager was on vacation for a week. I have NEVER heard of any restaurant with only one person who has the ability to provide refunds. They did issue a credit for a free pizza. We were also told that even if they did do a refund it would be for the pizza only. Apparently they don't do complete refunds, which makes 0 sense. When the pizza did arrive, it was cold and the box was smashed. The garlic bread was bland and cold. The Caesar salad was soggy, and you could tell they had packaged it 45 minutes ago. This place has promise, but I will only give them one more shot before I write them off. I hope that their management reads this, and changes are enacted.",

At 11:49am we get a call from the driver asking where we were. Upon talking to him further we figured out his location (which was not close) and he said he would be there in 10 minutes. At 12:21pm I finally called Joe's and cancelled my order. As I hang up the delivery driver shows up and gives us the food. I told him I wasn't paying for it and he said he was sorry. We threw the food away and continued working. At 2:05pm we finished working and I called Joe's to make sure I was not getting charged and was informed that the Owner said since I accepted the food he was not refunding my money. This is a disgusting statement made by an owner and he/she should be ashamed of this type of practice. I suggest if you are looking for pizza to go somewhere where your business is actually appreciated. Clearly my business wasn't. If I could give zero stars I would.",

My flight from Hawaii got in at midnight, which got me to my hotel at around 2am, I was pretty hungry and with the time difference couldn't sleep, so I wanted food and couldn't find anything open.  The hotel recommended this place, so I called them. Sure enough, they were open. My cell phone had AWFUL reception, so I ended up ordering a whole pizza and some wings instead of a slice of pizza...but they DO take orders of pizza by the slice.  The food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time, and the pizza was meh. Oily, crust wasn't very good, I mean..really just a meh pizza.  The wings were pretty decent though, especially for a pizza place, so I was happy. I ended up throwing out most of the pizza as it was MASSIVE and wouldn't fit in the hotel fridge.  So pizza:  Quantity over quality. You will get a BIG pizza for a good price  On my last night there, I wanted food again, so I ordered some wings and this time gotten a chicken parm hero.   Delivery took a long time and they forgot my sandwich. They then came back with my sandwich and it was again, meh. Way under seasoned, and just not that good. Again, it was big, so quantity over quality.",

When I told the guy that I paid for the pizza to be to go and for ranch, he just handed me the plate, said sorry, and that e water was free..thanks for my free tap water, however even their machine was broken so I couldn't even get my free tap water.   I'd go to Gus's pizza next door..they don't try to overcharge you for $2!",

I put it on speaker at the party i was hosting so everyone there could laugh at the ridiculousness that was happening on the other end. Outrageous from a professional stand point and need strong leadership on the weekends to keep it a solid business",

Ordered several different slices: veggie, pepperoni & mushrooms, and a deep dish sausage & pepperoni. We really enjoyed the thin crust pizza, just like what you get from NY.  I had to get a couple more slices of pepperoni & mushroom it was that good.  Don't know if this an Arizona thing but they offered ranch dressing to go with my pizza, I told them that was sacrilegious. Apparently they go through three large plastic tubs of individually portioned ranch dressing a night.  Really good customer service. Lots of pizza available so you don't have to wait to long. Great thing is they are open till 4 AM.   When in the area go and visit. This will definitely be a stop if we are ever in Scottsdale again.",

Went to Sprouts and they had lost our order, not sure how, but they did.  We were in bind because Sprouts could not accommodate us, so we rushed to Joe's.  We explained what happened to Kevin (Joe's associate) and he was able to assist us and gave us a discount on our order.  He was able to make things happen in a short amount of time and he was able to save the day.  Great Customer Service Kevin!!!",

If you must eat here you should be drunk and eat only 1 slice of pizza. Also the cooks are lazy because they never make sicilian pizza  assuming nobody eats this kind of pizza until after 8pm.

I worked at an office building across the street and ate here quite a bit (more than I probably should have). Most of the times it was for their lunch special which is buy two slices and get a third free, I believe its normally around $6 which is a good deal especially in Old Town.   In terms of their actual pizza, I am a big fan of the bbq chicken.. I would dare to say that it's one of the best bbq pizzas out there! Of course, they have great selection and all but one of the pizzas are sure to amaze (sorry, but I'm not a fan of the buffalo).  None the less, Joe's is simply amazing and Joe is a pretty good guy himself (he's in everyday at lunch). In fact when I told him it was my last time at Joe's due to a move he thanked me for \"being part of the family\" and gave me pizza on the house (told you I went there a lot lol)!",

What was supposed to be a nice thin crust crispy pizza, came out of the box,  cooked and dried out on top, soggy and drippy underneath. ( I really think it was a frozen pizza) The crust tasted like one of those baking powder, quick rising bitter and mealy crusts like you see in the frozen food sections. Horrible on a good day. The toppings looked like they had been applied with a rolling pin, perhaps they were, or perhaps it was made ahead, and then taken out of a stack , seriously a sorry looking mess. We tried but were unsuccessful in eating more than one slice of this thing. The rest, went straight to the garbage, I'd have returned it, but what's the point. If this is the best they can do, I don't want another one. So, what's the point??  The point is, I've done the research so now you don't have to. There are plenty of other Pizza places in town, eat there!",

I would not order from here in the future.",

When I have gone to Joe's, it is VERY late night as the various clubs near Shoeman/Scottsdale begin to wind down, and this place has a huge line out the door every time.  The pizza, which is sold by the HUGE slice, is simply acceptable - not special, not delectable, not even excellent.....just acceptable.  For me, pizza starts with a great cheese, and the cheese here just seems so....bashas-like and ordinary, without that quality mouthfeel you get from cheese at places like Street of New York.      Of course, when you're binging after six drinks, \"acceptable\" has a funny way of becoming \"I must have it right now.\"  So I'm sure I'll go there in the future, but my expectations will be well calibrated -- This is drinking food, placed smack dab in a location that caters directly to people that have been drinking.  Buzzed or not, that long line can sure be annoying.....",

    "text": "My favorite Phoenix pizza joint! Wonderful service! The woman who generally answers the phone is so polite and friendly. On top of that, the delivery guys are always friendly too. The last time I ordered, I was pulling an all-nighter to finish a final and it was 2:30AM. Between the time I ordered and the delivery, it started pouring rain, and the delivery guy was 10 minutes later than they quoted me. I didn't even mention it, but he apologized anyway and was extremely thankful and friendly.   The pizza is SERIOUSLY good! I love thin crust, New York style pizza and this place truly gets the job done! Delivery is always fast and customer service is excellent. They're open late and they're always appreciative of your patronage.  After trying a gazillion pizza places in Phoenix/Scottsdale, I finally found the place and I will not order from anywhere else. If you normally order from Gus's, give Joe's a shot and I bet you won't go back.  TIP: Pizza is excellent, but if you're in the mood for something else, try the Penne and Broccoli with chicken. It's really good. Don't expect fancy Italian restaurant quality, but it's still a damn good meal.  TIP#2: The Garlic Knotts are SUPER Garlic-y. If you're not a fan of TONS of garlic, ask them to go light on it. I can't stand too much garlic, but my boyfriend loves it and is now addicted to these. Seriously - expect to be chewing on pieces of garlic. I'm not complaining though - they're still really good :)",

When I had called to,let them know at 1st the lady on the phone told me there was NO spinach on the order, I had told her I am looking on my ONLINE receipt that tells me there is and was CHARGED for it. She muted the phone and made it right to offer me a free meal next time. Pretty good food but did not care to be told I did not order something on a pizza when CLEARLY it was stated on my ONLINE receipt. ?",

    "text": "5 stars for New York style pizza 1 star for Sicilian  I have lived in Old Town for almost 2 years and have been on a mission to find good pizza.  I discovered Joe's a couple of months ago when a friend had ordered it, and I loved it!  It was the New York style pizza, and it was perfect for me-- just greasy enough, lots of cheese, not too much sauce.  The last 2 times I've ordered, I've eaten an entire 18' pizza with only one other person!    BUT...last night my bf and I made the mistake of ordering the Sicilian pizza.  He and I both loved the Sicilan pizza at a place called Jet's pizza prior to moving to Scottsdale, which doesn't have a Jet's.  The Sicilian at Joe's is nothing like Jet's, unfortunately.  It is all crust.  I like thick crust when it's good, but this was just dry, bland, and seriously at least an inch thick.  There was not much cheese or sauce, and, even if there had been, it would still have been overpowered by the crust.  I even tried dipping in ranch, and, still, all I got was crust.  What made it worse was that the Sicilian only came in one size-- 18 x 12!  So, we paid almost $30 for one pizza and just ended up throwing away most of it.    I will keep ordering from Joe's, but, from now on, I'll stick with the New York style pizza.",

I would defiently recommend Joes as a great takeout option in the old town area. One time I even asked for them to customize my pizza (extra sauce, less cheese, add toppings and cut a certain way) they followed the direction and the pizza was delicious. The only thing I ordered last week that I wasn't a big fan of was the salad with salami, cheese and roasted peppers. The cheese and salami were mixed together and cut together so it was difficult to remove the tons of cheese they put on the salad. It didn't taste bad just not what I prefer. Pizza and fried snacks however were great. I'd recommend trying the eggplant on a pizza!",

After 2 a.m. there is a line, but it is well worth the wait and the staff is pretty great at getting all the drunkies orders in and out in impressive speed. The thin crust style is amazing and consistent with each pie. One can purchase slices or whole pies to enjoy in the compact seating area big enough for about 20 or so patrons or one can opt to find a spot outside on the curb or the short, random wall next to the store. I've never been here before 1 A.M., but apparently they are open for lunch and offer a variety of different Italian comfort foods then.  Besides the entertaining hot messes after 2 A.M. Joe's also offers: an ATM Machine, tiny cups for water, fifty cent fee for using cards, and grease, lots and lots of grease! Stumble on over the next time you need some food to help curb your hangover!",

Couldn't taste any bbq sauce on it, it was just sweet like honey, the chicken tasted like it was boiled in hot water with no seasonings and the crust was chewy.

Five minutes later our delivery driver called us and told us he was in the parking lot and there was no parking available so we would have to go down and grab the pizza from him (if we wanted to do that we wouldn't have ordered pizza for delivery). When we went down no one was there, we called the guy back and he told us he was at the wrong building. We cancelled the order, they lack communication and I don't think they understand English much either. Frustrating, would have loved to give them a try but will not now nor will we recommend this place to anyone. Sucky service, lady on the phone was rude!",

After over an hour, this smug delivery guy shows up and asks for 21.50.  All I had were two 20s - and he only had 6 dollars in change!  He didn't even apologize or try to fix the problem, just gave me a smug look and took 34 dollars for a 21 dollar order!  Real classy.  And the pizza was cold, greasy, and generally quite awful.  Super stingy with toppings.    Avoid this place at all costs.  An absolute rip-off that makes a sucky pizza.",

    "text": "I've made 3 attempts to buy pizza from Joe's and only one was successful.  It was good but my experiences have been bizarre to say the least. I heard that Joe's had really good New York style pizza and as an East Coast transplant, I'm always looking for good pizza. The first time I tried to get pizza was about a year ago. I called and asked if I could order a Sicilian pie to pick up. They took my order and I hung up. About 1/2 hour later my phone rings and the caller ID says the call is from Alaska. I almost didn't pick up but I did and it was Joe's calling back(Alaska - I thought they were from NY?? ok people move around - keep old cell phone numbers or maybe it was an employee - whatever) but they tell me that oops I can't have Sicilian pizza because they don't have any Sicilian dough. Wait what? This is a Pizzeria right? It's Saturday night right??? In downtown Scottsdale right??? Forget it.   My second order a few months later for plain take out pizza went fine and it was good. The reason I felt compelled to write this review is experience #3 which happened about a week ago. It was weirder than the first one. Decided to give Joe's another try for the Sicilian pizza. I called and someone answered but there were long silences and I was like \"Hellooo?\" \"anyone there??\" and I had a very hard time understanding the person who answered the phone. It was like they were training or speaking to someone else while talking to me. Another reviewer mentioned an answering service and while I think that is super strange for a pizza place, that's what it felt like. Anyway I asked for Sicilian and she said they don't have that. I said you don't have Sicilian pizza? But it's on the menu. She said they only have the specialty pizza with everything on it. I said that's it? Only one type of pizza and it has everything on it? Nothing else? She said yes. I hung up.",

I also enjoyed the pizza, great flavors in the sauce and good toppings however I'm more of a crispy crust type of gal.  This place is good for a quick lunch. They have several pre-made pizza's to choose from behind the counter... pick out your slices and then they add them to their ovens to warm and crisp them up a bit. It's affordable as well and very much a mom & pop type of place so if you like to support locally owned businesses give this place a try.",

    "text": "This is the BEST pizza in AZ!   I lived in NYC for five years and when I returned home, I yearned to find pizza in Scottsdale/Phoenix as good as what I enjoyed while living in New York. There are many places that claim to be NY style pizza but Joe's New York Pizza is the real deal! Their cheese is absolutely delicious and all the toppings I tried so far knock it out of the park. Their crust is perfectly thin and crunchy in all the right places. A True giveaway that they know how to make pizza.   I've read a lot of reviews that are not that great - sometimes due to service or what have you. But trust me if you are looking for NY style pizza, this joint is the place. They also have garlic powder (a staple in NY pizzerias) available to sprinkle on your pizza, just ask them for it.   Thank you Joe's New York Pizza for answering my cravings for NY style pizza!",

I was told it was on the way. This was around 230am. I was told it would take around 45 minutes (understandable) At about 350, i still have not received my pizza. I called again, and the woman on the phone told me they were closed, which is fine, then when I asked if it was going to receive my pizza I ordered an hour and a half ago, I was hung up on. I work late shifts, it's hard to get food late at night, and it's ridiculous that this seems to always happen here.",

About an hour and a half later, I started waiting  outside my hotel, in the cold, to assist the driver, who has my number. Two hours later, about 3:20 AM, I called Joe's Pizza. The same young girl said all the orders were canceled and the driver tried to call me. BS! My phone never rang. I waited two hours to be lied to, even after I paid them! Either deliver the pizza or don't take the order. And then don'tlie about it. Pretty rotten thing to do to someone. Not at all right.",

Pizza, burgers and more all available basically all day and night.  Good foldable NY slices at very reasonable prices. Kind of hard to find the 1st time but well worth the effort. Parking garage in back has free public parking.  Sunday in Old Town during football season makes parking on the streets nearby tough.   Remember to use your yelp cash back benefit here.

I believe customers would rather wait a few minutes for a fresh pizza with hot melting cheese and sauce to arrive then to re heat a slice that's been sitting out for a while and try to make the pizza oven bring it back to life. Come on Joe's, you can do better.",

The wings were so greasy that I couldn't get the grease stain of my white countertop. After the entire order including tip, I spent around $30 (not worth it). This piece of cardboard wasn't worth more than $5. New York pizza slices are large and usually takes a large fold over in order to handle and eat. Joes pizza was like picking up a slice of microwaveable Totinos pizza. Hardly a New York style pizza.

    "text": "The Short: A mirage of legitimate New York pizza hanging around the middle of the dessert.   The Pros: - Affordable! - Open late (4 a.m.)! - Beer delivery! - Decent menu options. - Greasy pepperoni (for those that like that kind of thing).   The Cons: - Staff can be hit or miss (night staff much better than day). - Pizza is pretty bland beyond the scrum-diddly-umptious pepperoni grease.  - Uses McDonald's grade ingredients.  - Some items, such as garlic knots, have a tendency to be undercooked.   Best Item(s): - Pepperoni pizza. - Spaghetti w/ meat sauce.  Stay Away From: - Garlic knots. - All veggie pizzas. - The restroom! I now suffer from PTRSD (post-traumatic restroom stress disorder).   __________________________________________  The Story:   When reviewing a restaurant it's essential to consider the type of establishment it is trying to be. What is their overall game plan? What are they trying to sell you? For example, you wouldn't give Dicks Last Resort a negative grade for customer service. The staff treating you like the butt of an Archie Bunker joke is kind of their thing.  So with that in mind, I approached Joe's New York Pizza after a night of debauchery and loud music in Old Town Scottsdale. I ordered a pepperoni pizza and garlic knots, had a pleasant conversation with the staff, and walked back to my hotel to enjoy my post concert nourishment.   The inside of Joe's was pretty standard for a late night eatery. Everything looked like it was a heart attack waiting to happen and the surroundings weren't particularly clean or dirty. That offbeat middle point that only a place open at 2 a.m. is able to find.   Back in the hotel, I was astonished how amazing the pizza tasted. It was about 70 percent grease, but that grease was the most delicious substance I have ever had. I would have free-based it if such a thing were possible. The same could not be said about the garlic knots. They had the flavor of a week old pretzel pulled out of the mall dumpster. Two bites were enough.  The next morning I decided to give Joe's another visit. It was at this point I realized how much the loud music had affected my judgment the night before. The entire place was dirty (all of the tables needed whipped down and I'm fairly certain the Custer's Last Stand had just occurred in the bathroom). An eclectic mix of individuals, who matched the emotional level of a Nine Inch Nails crowd in the early '90s, replaced the once exuberant staff. The pizza grease still tasted like a solid brick of pepperoni, which is a good thing, but the cheese was beyond inedible. It was a night and day difference (get it).   I am very confident that the night staff was a sociable as I remember, but nothing else matched the enchantment of my first time there.   It makes sense though. Awards for being 'the best cheap place to eat' were hung on every wall in the dinning room and precisely define the restaurant. It's the McDonalds of late night pizza. The problem is, I can eat McDonald's fries anytime. I know they're the potato version of plastic surgery, but they still have a taste that almost anyone can enjoy. That's their one item. For Burger King it's the Whooper. Joe's doesn't have this. Their pizza hasn't hit that pinnacle yet. My guess, using a cheese that doesn't make me want to set my tongue on fire would fix the problem.   Joe's is likely satisfied with their place in the culinary world. Inebriated customers rarely complain and usually tip pretty well. I expect this place to stay three stars for a long loooong time.",

And when it's past 11PM and all traditional pizza joints are closed, you start to get desperate.   We found Joe's through Yelp, because as many of you know, finding delivery past a certain hour in the confines of PV/Scottsdale is near impossible. But hey, we were surprised when we found out that Joe's was open until 4AM and delivers!   Not much to say, other than we ordered a pepperoni pizza and some wings. The delivery time was around 30 minutes which is beyond fair and reasonable for a non-franchised place that does late night deliveries. The delivery man did have a relatively hard time finding our home, but after a few phone conversations and us venturing outside to lure him to the right house, we made the money-for-pizza exchange.   The pizza itself was good. Not the greatest pizza I've ever had in my life but by far not the worst. They gave us extra sides of sauces (for the wings) and some ranch which was an added bonus. Let's be real, when the late-night drunken hunger strikes again, we will absolutely order from Joe's.",

And I mean nothing, the crust though flavorful, lacks that NYS foldable softness, and it also lacks that signature chewiness!  Now all of that being said, this isn't a bad slice of za! Though it looked as if it had been sitting all day, the ingredients were still tasty and fresh. However the temperature of my slice was not acceptable, it was fairly cold, but I was there at 3am so there's that! Would I go there again, yes it's one of the few late night food options in Old Town, and it served its purpose! In fact I would probably do exactly what I did on this night and that's get a slice from here and a slice from Gus's which is right next door!",

This was at one time one of the few authentic pizza places in town if you wanted my style. A ton of places like to say they are east coast style when they never even tried pizza in NYC.   Clearly this place got a new owner. They should have changed the name when they decided to change the recipe. They now serve cracker with cheese.   It's actually even worse than gus. Which is also a terrible excuse for nystyle pizza. Seriously this is so terrible that it's not even going to be good if your drunk. Typical Arizona pizza that tastes like they ran the dough through a filling pin instead of hand tossing it. Watch I love Lucy your supposed to toss it in the air to get the crust texture right. Damn shame",

I usually get the pepperoni and sausage or pepperoni and jalapeno slices. I like the thin sliced pizza and the flavor is good.   This place has some of the best ranch!! I love ranch on my pizza and they have good ranch.   I rated it 4 stars because the guys in the back are cool and always nice. They are quick and know how to deal with crowds whether nice or a little loose. The pizza I actually like and they also stay open super late.   It is a smaller place but they have outside seating which helps for the late night crowds. So if you have a huge group it might not be a good spot to go unless you take it with you. The prices are fairly reasonable too and not too cr  I will obviously be back and getting that ranch with the pizza.",

The pizza is 3 stars, the price is 4 stars and the service is 2 stars, which provides the logic (when averaged) for my three star review.

I gotta tell ya, I know this is a late night stop in old town but, you're better off stopping at a grocery store on the way home and grabbing a pizza from the frozen section.

However, somewhere within the last few years, that has completely changed and I will now crawl 3 blocks in the middle of summer, around Club Jersey Shore to get a slice of pizza here.   I've never been to New York but the level of friendless from the staff here is a good indication that this place is probably legit.    That being said, you can guess how great the pizza is if that doesn't deter me from shamelessly shoving two slices down my throat while still sweating from my walk to the restaurant.  Honestly, the pizza is amazing and it doesn't sit like a rock in your stomach after you inhale it (which you will, go for the pepperoni).  Plus, I'm serious about Club Jersey Shore, there were less neon shirts in the 90's than the club rats were wearing that gravitated towards this tribute to douchery.

The sicilian slices are amazing and really filling, make sure you ask them to make it fresh, it's worth the 10 minute wait. They have a nice selection of sodas, including my favorites root beer and cream soda. My boss and a coworker of mine told me about this place and I'm glad they did. The owner was really nice, I believe her name was Lori and I think she's from Brooklyn. She was so happy to see another New Yorker that she gave me and my girlfriend a couple of free slices along with some sodas. That was really cool of her. Actually the truth is we came here the night before and had a horrible experience. We were served old, bland tasting slices of pizza with no flavor or tomato sauce and the next day I ended up calling and asked to speak to the owner or manager and the lady who picked up said that that was her. I told her about my experience and she said that she was sorry about what happened and that she fired the worker who made those slices. she said he was on his way out anyway and probably messed up the slices on purpose out of spite, which does seem like something someone might do in that situation I guess. She told me to come in and she would show me how her pizza really tastes like. I decided to give the place a second chance and I'm really glad that I did. Everything we ordered she gave to us on the house and it tasted so much better the second time around. The pizza was fresh and had a good flavor to it. She said she wasn't in the previous night and that I would have never had a bad experience had she been there the first night I went. I think I believe her. She was so nice! If you've ever had a bad experience at this restaurant, speak with Lori. She will show just how good their food actually is. I like how they have two good sized televisions with whatever the best sports game at the moment is playing and hip hop music from new york playing in the backround. A chill spot, where you can eat good pizza and enjoy some beer as well. Most pizza restaurants with \"New York\" in their name in Arizona are just using the name as a gimmick and don't really sell NY pizza. This one actually does sell authentic NY pizza. The slices could use a little more salt and olive oil, but it's still pretty darn good. That would just make it perfect if they did that. I recommend this place to everyone. Thanks Lori for the awesome hospitality and the great food you serve at your restaurant. I dig this restaurant and will definently be coming back.",

This place is open until 4am and delivered a nice large thin crust sausage pizza with extra cheese in about 30 min.  Considering that this is not NYC or Chicago, the pizza was very satisfying and reasonably priced.  Tasty thin crust pizza from a delivery place that opens very late to satisfy post midnight cravings.  Hit the spot.  Would order again. Not gourmet or artisanal pizza but very tasty and satisfying.  Much better than dominos or papa johns or similar chains.  Would give 3.5 stars for late night/early morning opening and delivery.",

I should not have had to argue with him about it.  I didn't even get an apology.    To boot, the pizza was quite subpar, very dry.

    "text": "3.5 stars!  I'm all about instant gratification, especially with food. I had tussled with another Scottsdale business who insisted delivery could take up to 40 minutes...for a sandwich and went on to option B, Joe's NY Pizza. The woman who answered the phone was great, didn't put me on hold endlessly, answered my questions and told me I could get my lunch in less than 20 mins. Good news, because I was STARVING (as in hadn't eaten for 5 hours).   Joe's doesn't charge a minimum for delivery, another relief so I ordered the greek salad and 1 slice of pizza with spinach. Delivery was quick and friendly, and my food was just what I expected from a pizza place. My pizza was a big juicy slice (not as big as a real NY slice but those things are ENORMOUS) with plenty of chopped spinach, a nice red sauce and a light coating of cheese. Entirely foldable, entirely into my belly. YUM.   The greek salad was okay - good price for the size of the salad, small chopped onion and black olive, a decent sprinkle of feta cheese. The only downside was the iceberg lettuce. I wonder if Joe's would consider a $1.50 supplement charge to use mixed greens. Because I would happily pay extra for some red leaf/arugula/mesclun blend. But it was fine as cheap salads go and filled me up.   If I need quick cheap delivery for lunch again, I will definitely call Joe's.",

The Caesar was good, nothing special, but good.

I have eaten at Joe's many times late at night, but today we had it delivered and thought I should finally review it. A full fresh pie is a little different from ordering a reheated slice at the counter, right?  The pizza is good for NY style. Nice flavors and decent ingredients. You get a lot of pizza for the money... particularly if you pick it up yourself - but 20 bucks delivered for an 18 inch one topping (including tip) isn't bad.   They were pretty nice when I called in my order which can be a bit of a contrast to the experience you get when you show up in person at 2am, but how else would they be expected to handle a line of hungry drunk clubtards going out the door? I was told 30 minutes (which would've been nice), but it took closer to an hour. I've worked pizza delivery when I was a kid and that kind of thing is understandable. No big deal. Now, if it happens every time I order from them, I might start to get bummed.  The pizza here isn't quite 5 star to me, but it's close.",

    "text": "If I could give them no stars, I would.  I've ordered from this place before, and, other than a few mishaps, ud's been okay.  Tonight, though, I've been working in some projects, and u got hungry and decided to order, which ended up being a big mistake.  I ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and Coke.  The meal is supposed to come with a small salad and garlic bread.  On the online order site, there's a place for special directions.  As usual, I wrote for the driver to please call when here, to NOT knock because it sets the dogs off, and even thanked them.  The order was supposed take 45 minutes to an hour, but, about 25 minutes later, there's a knock at my door and, of course, it sets the dogs off, and while I'm trying to separate them, I get bitten, and good.  All I got from the delivery guy was a quick \"sorry\" and, can you please sign here, even as my hand was dripping blood.  I even tipped the guy.  Then, I call to tell a manager what happened, and find out there's not a manager there.  The woman takes my number, and says she'll have somebody call me.  So, after cleaning the wounds the besti can and dressing them, I figure I'll at least go ahead and eat.  Why not?  I paid for it, right?  Guess what?  No salad.  So, again, I called back, got a guy who I had a difficult time understanding, who now says he's the manager.  He kept asking me, \"What do you want me to do for you?\"  He asked if they should come back and get the order or if they should bring me a new order, never addressing the bites fully.  He tells me that he asked the delivery driver who, I might add, has the same accent, and he says he was sorry.  I asked him what he thought he should do for me, and he wouldn't answer.  I hung up.  I will never, ever order from here again, and post this story everywhere I can.  I'm also contacting a lawyer...  Why have the question about special directions, if nobody's going to read them.  I'm think g this is neglect...  And I'm calling a lawyer.  Pay attention next time, and provide a little customer service every-once-in-awhile..",

Joe's is my go-to-place while out in Old Town. My routine is to leave the club around 1am, but not w/o getting a stamp for re-entry, stop in for a slice before a line forms, then return to the club for last call.  They have serveral types of pizza available for re-heating. I like the basil and tomato with no sauce. It has just the right amount of cheese and the crust is slightly crispy yet chewy.   I should try it sober one day. Hopefully I'll enjoy it just as much!",

The one big miss is that they're obviously Yankee fans, and I'm from the Mets camp.  Just kidding, anything other than the Cubs are OK in my book. Thank god this isn't a Chicago \"pizza\" joint.",

I was initially sad to hear she was moving back to NYC and was curious what was gonna happen to the place.   The new owner's are amazing. They took my constructive criticism and made adjustments accordingly to get the pizza exactly how it was before! If you like a crispy bottom this is the place to go. None of the soggy bottom toppings falling off on first bite etc. Don't be fooled by Gus' Pizza down the way. This isn't a chain which in my opinion makes it better on its own. There's a line for a reason.... IT'S WORTH THE WAIT!",

This place used to be good back 4-5 yrs ago, but they now are doing the public a disservice with a very poor quality product for a premium price. They should just close their doors. How do they sleep at night stealing from their customers. Please just go anywhere but here.",

I'm a New Yorker to the bone and this place looks like an NY Pizzeria that you get slices in or order a regular or pie with toppings. Like most places they have their pizza around $3 to $4 per slice which at this point is the going rate in most of the country.    Order slices of pizza here, they will put it in the oven and take it out when it's hot. Then you pay. It's pretty simple concept.  Yes they have salads and sandwiches which I have never had but understand their specialty is delicious pizza by the slice.  If you really want a salad you should go somewhere else.    I have gotten delivery once during the day and the pizza was great and quickly delivered.  But those of you ordering drunk food after midnight I just don't know what you expect. Where else around Old Town is open past the bars?  If you're mad about the price ask about it before you agree on ordering the food.",

Joe's is a small spot, with lots of easy street parking. I popped in for lunch and they have numerous pizzas out for you to choose your slices from. Once you pick what you want they pop it in the oven for a quick reheat.   The staff is super friendly and seem relieved to have customers who are sober for a change. I cannot imagine the shit show that is Fri/Sat nights after the bars close. Yikes.   Moving on, the pizza was surprisingly good. Very fresh and you can taste the quality ingredients. I was pleasantly surprised with how good it was.   So when you need a quick lunch- check out Joe's. If you're there after getting hammered- pull yourself together and try and adult better.

    "text": "I ordered a pizza, online through Slice, Sunday, May 7 2018 at 1150 pm received a confirmation email with a 60 min delivery eta. I called at 1250 am and was hung up on. I called back at 0130 and was put on hold. They never picked up and after 15 minutes I hung up. I called back at 0230, by this time over 2 hours waiting. They confirmed my name and location, I'm literally 6 minutes down the road, but unfortunately I'm working overnights and can't leave the job, and they said it was out for delivery. I waited until 0345 and called back and asked for the manager. First he said he couldn't find my order, asked how I ordered it, I stated through slice, from their website, he then found my order confirmed my name and location, and then had the nerve to say the delivery driver called me and said I didn't answer. He asked what apartment number I was at. I informed the \"all knowing manager\" that I work at a hospital down the street and that I'm in the emergency department. There was notes attached to my order to \"please deliver to the emergency department\" name of the hospital and address were in the notes, which they confirmed several times. The manager then asked if I wanted the pizza, I asked will it be fresh, he said he could bring the same pizza back, really? A 4 hour old pizza, wow, I never received customer service like this before. I even lived in New York they don't treat you like this. I asked the manager for a refund, he said okay. I'm still waiting for a refund 3 days later. ugh, never again, don't do it, there are other pizza places closer lol",

You were not on the phone with me so you have no clue what was said. And if you had to wait longer it was due to the morons working there because the phone call lasted 15 seconds.  This place I never liked but for some reason they did make a good calzone 50 percent of the time my wife liked but we found better calzone. The food sucks, The employees suck.

Bit into three mozz sticks before I encounter one mozzarella stick that contain what was expected.   Bottom line--  Joes sucks now, spend your money else where. Bad customer service and subpar food.   In response to employees comment--  I asked for things that are on your menu. I asked for you to substitute fries for the bread on the Philly cheesesteak, all of those items are on your menu. I would understand if I was asking for things in which you did not have anymore, but you have both fries and Philly cheesesteaks on your menu.

We orderd: Philly Cheesesteak Calzone Garlic Knots French Fries  My cheese steak was practically empty. There was about 80% bread going on here. I had to add some of my own to make it more tasty! What little meat there was, wasn't horrible. The french fries were sad - I mean SAD. They were wet and limp with no flavor at all. The texture was just weird. The calzone was made with Mozzarella, Ricotta, onions, peppers and sausage...this could have been good if the dough was cooked more and it wasn't drowning in ricotta cheese.  The only think I truly enjoyed was the garlic knots. They were fantastic! Little pieces of garlic heaven. If you do not LOVE garlic I would stay away from these little buddies as they are covered in it. Yum!  Previously, we've eaten here late night and had delicious pizza. IF I ever return I will stick to the pizza.",

After I found another job (far, far away) I didn't go back for ages. When I did, I was surprised that the owner remembered me! (and kind of flattered).  Anyway Joe's pizza is NY pizza. Thing crust, shiny, a little drippy. I had it yet again tonight after Papa John's informed me they no longer deliver to my zip code (85250). Then I remembered Joe's delivered and the day (but sadly, not ALDS Game 5 at this point) was saved.

Anyways I went in there to order some food service was not bad as everyone seems to complain about. I was greeted and taken care of in a timely manner. So I ordered a chicken roll and my husband a calzone. Wait time for my food was about 12 min max. Not too bad but not great either. I finally got my food and as I anxiously bit into my food I did not get what I was expecting! Pretty plain Jane. Not much flavor to it. There was way too much dough and you can taste the flavorless chicken. Like it just tasted like boiled chicken on dough. I didn't finish it because it made me nauseous. The flavor was just too unpleasant. So in conclusion I will not be going back! Their food did not appeal to me and one taste of that chicken roll was enough! Oh and by the way I gave them 3 stars because place was nice and clean, nice staff, great hours and food was cheap.",

Being a pizza critic I was a lil disappointed on our first visit. The next day my boyfriend called and spoke to the manager. Lisa was the nicest person she invited us back for a better experience and enjoy better tasting free on the house pizza. I guess it turns out the guy making pizza the night before purposely made crappy slices because it last night working there and the owner was out. The next visit we had much better tasting pizza we enjoyed 2 regular cheese slices and 2 Sicilian slices with free drinks, this was definitely better than the 1st visit. I would say its close to new york tasting pizza but the sauce still needs more salt or flavors and maybe olive oil or butter on the dough. With that it would be perfect!  Well thank you to the owner she made us very happy and we will be definitely going back.",

I work at a nearby business and I decided to try them, Lo and behold they always charged me more than what the specified amount was. This was not an isolated incident either this happened multiple times. Always ask for a receipt if you decided to eat here other wise they will take advantage of you.  DO NOT GO HERE THEY ARE THIEF'S,",

    "text": "where is the love? something was missing with my last visit to Joe's New York Pizza.......where is Joe?!?! i admit it has been at least a year since i have been in there last.( i got hooked on the other side of the street with best of Italy pizza) i couldn't get enough people to agree on one type of pie so i got a few slices.  They were big slices and the crust was thin, they might have had a chance if they were not \"marinating\" in the window for an hour.  i like to load up on parm and crushed red pepper after I'm through with condiments it all tastes the same but nothing i can do can hide far from fresh product.  if you find yourself on that side of town and need late night food check out Best of italy or Philly Sandwich(24hrs!!!wtf) on 5th ave and scottsdale",

You will definitely be entertained while you wait in line with all the drunk people leaving the clubs making a fool of themselves, and you can see what the person really looks like you were grinding with in the club!",

Not only was the lady on the phone extremely nice but she chatted with me about NY and that was cool.  OK, now for the Pizza...  Pizza = Fantastic, just like back in Brooklyn. Delivery = Holy Crap, I barely had time to change the channels and the guy was at the door.  This guy (born and raised in NY) gives this Pizza 2 Thumbs UP!!",

His pizza joint is right across the street from a nightclub, so he can't expect his customers to be meek little mice that eat their pie in silence, right? WRONG! I came in with what one might describe as a rowdy group of girls on an early evening and Joe immediately started yelling at us to be quiet. We became a little annoyed and may have mentioned the fact that he can't really expect his patrons not to laugh or talk loudly and he promptly kicked us out. That's right, I have been kicked out of Joe's Pizza. But I'd still go back, it's good stuff.",
