However who cares?  The food quality and quantity is as good as it gets.  The prices are so cheap I guarantee you'll do a double take.  The staff is some of the nicest I've ever met, and the atmosphere is interesting to say the least.  It only took my very first dining experience at Big Hengs to give them the crown!  Everything is good, but my favorite is the Walnut Shrimp.",

The reason why this restaurant keeps us coming back and has me referring all of my friends is because you get a big bang for your buck. That, and the food is outstanding. Try the sesame beef and the emperors chicken. It is seriously to die for. I am in North Phoenix now so I spend a little extra drive time, but it is worth the drive. I love that it hasn't changed and it doesn't need to. It is my favorite little hole-in-the-wall! BTW, I was just reading reviews on Yelp to see about trying a new fun restaurant for Valentines day. I typed in Big Heng just to see what people think about it. LOL  If you don't like Big Heng, then I don't like you :D",

You can feed your whole family of 4 for under $20 with ease.    I love that they offer free hot tea, it is always good plus, and most of their lunch specials are just $5.45 and come with soup, rice and a lot of food, so much that I am usually stuffed when I leave.    As is custom with most Asian places, they have a separate menu for dinner, that is about 50% more pricey.  But don't feat they have dinner specials for $8 that are almost twice as big as the lunch ones, so big that we usually split just one and then order a large side of rice and a small appetizer and our whole family is stuffed, usually with leftovers, and all for way under $20.    Their service is quick once you order, I usually know what I want before I even go inside, so the 5 min or so it takes before they take your order is a bit long.  As soon as you order you get soup, then 2-3 min later your food is there...really just 2-3 min....",

She directed me to look at the picture as if she had something to do other than to gossip with her friend.  After the wait we got the food home & it was very bland & unsatisfying.  The teriyaki chicken sauce was like water (very thin).  They sent a couple of spoonfuls of chicken for our lettuce wraps.  If we had sat in we would have at least got a small box full of meat .  The cabbage in the lo mein wasn't cooked properly.  Just an unsatisfactory time, which began with awful customer service.  I guess you have so many customers you can afford to treat them crappy.",

We ordered two lunch specials and they start bringing us piping hot egg drop soup and as FAST AS CAN BE they bring out our lunch entrees.   I thought the hunan chicken was better than the Szechwan Chicken. That Szechwan sauce was mild and flat to me and the vegetables were mostly celery and green peppers but the canned bamboo shouts in this dish bothered me because I kept tasting can.  Like I already said the hunan chicken was better and I might have given four stars if this was the only dish I tried. The sauce was better, the vegetables in this dish were better, this dish did have heat to it.  Both meals had a nice vegetable to meat ratio and both were piping hot and everything seemed fresh.  Big Heng close to Tolmachhoff Farms so you might want to check them out if you stop by here.  3.5 stars",

    "text": "I have been eating here since I first moved to Peoria (I was in 3rd grade... so the late 90s?) and it is STILL my favorite Chinese restaurant. Every time I get Chinese, I compare it to Big Heng and I have never found anything comparable.   Some of my favorites: Teriyaki Chicken, Sesame Chicken, Garlic Chicken, Curry Chicken, Orange Chicken. The egg drop soup is the BEST. The PuPu Platter is so good (I love the beef skewers). They have the best egg rolls. Seriously the best. Crab puffs are amazing (they actually have crab in them, what a concept) and the best pork fried rice.   I used to ditch 4th period (I went to PHS) every few weeks and go to Big Heng with my boyfriend.   I have since moved away (first to Flagstaff, then Queen Creek and now living in Goodyear) and we still make the drive at least once a month to eat here.   They do use MSG in their cooking, which is the ONLY reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5.  The food is cheap, fast and it is always delicious. Lunch (served 11-3 I believe) is probably the best value (my SO and I can eat here during lunch for about $12) but dinner is great. The specials are more expensive at dinner, and limited, but you can sub the entrees for a fee.",

    "text": "Obligatory ENG101 assignment; however, my feelings are genuine and I do love Big Heng.  ___    Everyone has been at a point when they just wanted some good, cheap food. Maybe they cannot be bothered to cook or they are on a lunch break, still their desire is simple: to quell their hunger and to satisfy the palate.  People in the Glendale and Peoria area would be happy to know that there is a charming, hole-in-the-wall place to satisfy their needs. Big Heng is the go-to Chinese restaurant due to its affordability, service, and, of course, the food. Big Heng is a family owned, Chinese restaurant located on 75th and Peoria that has been open for over twenty years. It is open every day for lunch and dinner for dine-in and takeout. It offers Pepsi products and alcoholic beverages as well. Many locals have gone so far as to say that it is the best Chinese restaurant in town. One Yelp reviewer had said that they \"have tried different Chinese restaurants over the past year or so but they always falter somewhere along the line.  Whether it be in food quality or service....or both, Big Heng is still the best around!\" (P., Vinnie).    Most people want to be able to go out to eat without breaking the bank, but this restaurant is so cheap, it is available to anyone. All lunch items are available for less than six dollars. Lunch includes a large, piling plate of food with a choice of white or fried rice, an egg roll, and the entree. The rice is fluffy and light, and the egg roll is crispy, yet moist on the inside. Additionally, guests are also served a cup of egg drop soup with wontons on the side.  With so much food for such a low price, this restaurant has an excellent value that would make patrons feel that they had gotten their money's worth.        The wait staff of any restaurant can either make or break a guest's experience, and Big Heng's staff will be sure to provide excellent service. Big Heng has some of the friendliest staff in the area. The ladies there will absolutely come to know their customers and their families. They are absolute sweethearts; they are incredibly nice, polite, and treat guests as their friends. They will even ask their regulars where their usual dining companion is if they are missing. On top of being so personable, they have incredible customer service. The staff has such quick service that customers can expect to have their lunch in less than five minutes. Guests shouldn't worry about asking for anything because the staff is sure to have already taken care of it or have asked if anything was needed. They are also very knowledgeable about all their items and, if asked, will even give customers advice on how to cook their own Chinese food at home. The staff of Big Heng puts many restaurants to shame and should be the standard for waiters.        Naturally, the main focus of Big Heng is, of course, their delicious food. The restaurant offers food for every palate and diet. Big Heng prides itself in its variety of Chinese fare; it has Mandarin, Szechwan, Hunan, and Cantonese cuisine. Of these dishes, there are vegetarian, Kosher, and healthy options. The food tastes special; it is like the dishes are not easily replicated and that it can only be found there, yet it tastes oddly familiar and comforting. It is a very unique dining experience.The food- appetizers, main course, and the sides- are all well-seasoned, carefully cooked, and has great flavor. Unsurprisingly, with food like that, it leaves guests satisfied and coming back. The sesame chicken is a particular favorite of many guests; the chicken is perfectly breaded, dulcified in a sauce with an impeccable blend of sweet and savory, and is topped off with toasted sesame seeds. If chicken is not a particular favorite for someone, there are beef, shrimp, and pork dishes as well. The Lo Mein is well seasoned and the noodles are the right consistency, not too chewy or flimsy; it is what a noodle should be. The variety of Chinese cuisine offers amazing flavors and displays the talents and passion of the kitchen.     As great as Big Heng is, if there was one thing that could be improved, it would be its atmosphere. Admittedly, the ambiance is not great; it is located in a shady strip mall- the kind of strip mall with a rundown laundromat and questionable looking bar- and the inside is a bit tacky. The decor is cheap and passe; it is not exactly the type of place to have a nice date at. However, looks are not everything and it should not deter guests away. Sometimes it's the ugly oysters that produce the shiniest pearls, or it's the ghetto restaurants that have the best food.      Big Heng is an excellent Chinese restaurant that boasts an affordable price, excellent staff, and delicious, varied food. Considering the generous portions, it is a great value that manages to be of quality. Everyone in the Glendale and Peoria area should give Big Heng a visit to experience their unique, affordable Chinese cuisine and wonderful wait staff.",

The egg rolls were good, same with the beef and broccoli and BBQ pork fried rice.  While my father ((70's)) didn't like the beef, he later told me that since he has been down here he doesn't like any of the beef avaliable here. So I take his meh review of his beef lo mein with a grain of salt. My mom was pleased with her sweet and sour chicken.   Will look forward to my next trip now I have a menu to look at and pick something else",

It was flat beef with a bunch of onions.  We tasted one piece of meat and it had NO FLAVOR.  We CHUCKED IT.  Second order was Sweet & Sour Pork.  Where was the sauce?  It was pieces of pork deep fried with a batter coating and absolutely no flavor.  It was dry.  CHUCKED it.  Egg rolls were so bland.  CHUCKED them too.  Egg drop soup was eggs and broth only.  No flavor.  Had to add Frank's hot sauce to eat it.  Fried wontons for soup were good.  Kept them.  Third order was Cashew Shrimp.  One look and I did not want to taste it.  CHUCKED it #4.  Did manage to eat the Walnut Shrimp and Pork Fried Rice.  Out of the cost of $50.00 there were only three (3) items that were edible.  No thanks friend!",

I don't know if i changed or the food changed, but it completely lacks flavor beyond salt.  We ordered cashew chicken, emperor's chicken, vegetable lo mein, vegetable fried rice, and egg drop soup.  The cashew chicken was drowning in brown sauce that does nothing for it, but it was marginally better than the emperor's chicken.  The emperor's chicken is marked as a spicy dish, but there wasn't a hint of spice or any flavor in the dish.  The vegetable lo mein and fried rice were not as disappointing as the entrees, but they certainly aren't reasons to come back. The fried rice also contained mushrooms which isn't a crime, but worth mentioning for those who don't like them.  The egg drop soup was probably the best item we ordered. I don't have much experience to compare it, but it was a good consistency and a good value.  Sadly, we won't be returning. I've always gotten great service there and I'm happy for their success, but it's not for my family.",

The food came out faster than a fast food restaurant and our server always made sure our drinks were full.",

Everything tasted the way it should've but not of high quality (think fast food take out). The egg drop soup was bland and the egg roll was mostly vegetables. The only thing we almost finished was the fried rice on our combo plates.  Don't drink the ice water unless you get a lemon or something because Arizona's finest was off today.",

I got teriyaki chicken and beef and broccoli with fried rice and cream cheese wontons. All were yummy and my total was $17 for 2 dinner entrees! The fried rice they gave me was plain (no meat, veggies, or eggs) so I'll specify what kind of fried rice I want next time. They were busy when I went but service was fast. Will definitely be coming back to try more food! Update: their pork fried rice is delish but the pork fried rice and bbq pork fried rice taste almost exactly the same. Sweet & sour chicken is yummy, chicken lo mein is amazing. Fried shrimp is good, egg roll is ok and very thick. Egg drop soup isn't that good but not bad. Both times I got take out but didn't get fortune cookies",

The two sauces are like an amazing double dose of awesome in your mouth hole.  I always get an order of egg drop soup when I go. It's a small cup, but it's a perfectly sized appetizer.  Beef and broccoli is solid, egg rolls are on point and every meal so far has been great in it's own way. If you are ever around here, you won't be let down.",

Second, the prices were average but you are not allowed to substitute the rice for lo mein and the lo mein was $7-$9 depending on if you wanted meat or not. Third we got the sechwan beef and the Emperor's chicken both were supose to be spicy and they were far from spicy. The food lacked flavor, unless a lot of salt counts as flavor for you. You could taste the corn starch used to make the chicken crispy and there was more veggies and sauce then beef in the other entree. The food did not taste  very good and i will never go here to eat again and will not recomend to others for sure.",

When The food arrived, I saw why they suggested to change my order. They were out of the chicken. The lemon chicken looked like breaded chicken patties you get in the frozen food section that was cut up into squares. I've been here before with friends and the lemon chicken never looked/tasted this horrible. The food was not even hot, it was barely warm. My broccoli chicken was chewy. Never ending. It was cold as well. My brother was furious. I barely ate a small section and I always finish food. We boxed up our order and left.. I tried to get my brother to tip at least the minimum but he was so furious about the food that he signed his signature and left.  I will never eat here again. We usually eat at Yan's on 91st Ave & Thomas but wanted to venture out. Big mistake. We are going back to our usual awesome little gem.  Sorry Big Heng, you served us nasty scraps and you know it.",

I would be tempted if we went again to order just crab puffs, egg rolls and soup! The restaurant was clean, no weird smell (like a lot of older Chinese restaurants seem to have), and they had a nice crowd. However the chicken in the lo mein was all dark meat, the fried rice in the combo didn't have a lot of flavor, and the sweet and sour chicken wasn't coated in the sauce it was just drizzled on the top so some pieces didn't have any sauce - which most of the sauce went to the bottom of the plate and mixed with the lo mein (which didn't taste good together). Also several of the chunks of chicken were a bit rubbery. It's been a few hours since we ate and I feel bloated and very thirsty (so I am assuming a lot of salt is used in the food). I am still on my search for good Chinese food in the west valley. Big Heng is decent in a pinch if you want something edible that won't make you horribly ill, and you like BIG portions... but I wouldn't say it was the best or even very good. It was okay.",

She was very nice and walked us through a lot on their menu and explained that all of their food is made there homemade. She said a lot of restaurants order egg rolls and potstickers already made but they even make those in house as well. She also told us she has been working there for 20 years. She was very nice and kept checking on us and refilling our water glasses. Excellent service. There were several dirty tables when we came in (8pm) so maybe we just missed the dinner rush. They were busy cleaning all of the tables while we were there and didn't stop which made me feel better. The restaurant is in a small strip mall that is pretty old and you probably wouldn't go there unless someone recommended it just based on the looks of the outside. But on the inside we noticed that it was a very clean, it's pretty plain looking but it is clean even the ceiling tiles for an older building they're all clean and did not have any water stains which tends to happen in older places. We ordered potstickers which you could tell they are made there and they were good, not the best we have had but good. I ordered the Mongolian Beef which again was good but not the best I have had. I am really picky about beef and none of it was really chewy which was good. And the sauce was good. Their portions are large. My husband ordered I think it was the #4 combination plate which had sweet and sour chicken (it was pretty good), fried shrimp (he says they were alright, he's not a huge fan of fried shrimp), low Mein noodles (his favorite of everything we ordered), fried rice (just ok nothing but rice which was darker in color so you know it was fried but there was nothing else in it like eggs, peas, carrots which is what we are used to for fried rice and it didn't really have a lot of flavor). This might not sound like the best review but we did like the food and both said we would go back again. Our bill was $32 with tip so it is not expensive. Oh! And my husband really liked the egg drop soup that came with his meal and Winnie even gave me a cup even though my meal did not come with soup. Winnie gets 5 stars for her service. In our conversation she asked us what our names were and when we left she called us by our names. I am attaching pics of our food.",

One lady; while I was asking a question had this awful look on her face like she was answering a question from a piece of dog shit! Next my mother asked the other lady politely if she could have a side of hot mustard to go but as My mother tried explaining that she didn't want mustard packets and that she wanted the actual mustard from the kitchen the lady literally turned around and walked into the kitchen while my mother was in mid  Sentence ... Needless to say, it was not correct.... Orange chicken was chewy like rubber and had no flavor except if you like chewing rubber fructose syrup. Anyways the only thing that is decent is the sesame chicken and for that they get 1 star that's it!!!",

Mind you this was a busy friday night around 6:30 -7ish when no food should be left sitting like that even if it wasn't busy...who serves food like that! So disappointed!",

But in all honesty we were nowhere near pleased, and it saddens me to say I will never go back. We ordered Pot stickers, House Lomein, cup of Hot sour soup, Kung Pao 3 with steamed rice. The Pot stickers are weirdly steamed then stir fried to add the black burn marks around em, quite chewy. My cup of hot sour soup came to me with chips already placed in it, which I found to be odd, and what surprised me more was when I decided to dig in, no pork, no piece of shrimp. Just tofu, juice, and chips. No sour, no spice. I like to eat my chips on the side so they do not get soggy but I didn't send the soup back. The House Lomein was dark, it had a salty burnt taste which upset my boyfriend, he just packed up the noodles didn't bother to take another bite. Now for the Kung Pao 3, that was the only entree we liked. It was a bit salty but I got pass that by drinking it down with a lovely Dr.pepper, which that was a plus. Other than that, I was not to pleased. I suppose this place is not for us.",

My kids devoured the sweet and sour pork. I like that they put the sauce on the side so the tempura pork is still crispy when you get it home. The egg drop soup was quite flavorful. I like the house fried rice - it's probably just soy sauce and rice really, but it sure did taste good. I've been in Phoenix for 6 years and this is only the second Chinese food experience I've had that made me say, \"yes, I'd go there again.\"  The only thing I didn't really like was that the snow peas in the shrimp with snow peas were a bit soggy. But I can live with that knowing that everything else was a hit with the whole family. And the Dinner for 4 served 5 easily with enough leftovers for lunch for 5.",

It also came with egg drop soup. I LOVE egg drop soup, but most places don't make it good. They made some of the best I've ever had. Next time I go, I am just ordering a big bowl of that. Anyway, I had to pay an extra $1.50 because I substituted the sesame chicken for the teryiaki chicken. No biggie, it was still a steal! My BF got the sweet and sour pork with fried shrimp and lo mein and fried rice. He loved it too. He said their hot mustard was the hottest he's ever had.......and then ran a train on it :o) Only thing I didn't like was the bathroom. But hey, who rates a restaurant on that?? It just stunk and was also used as a storage closet. Anyway, if you're out this way, stop in. You'll get amazing food for an unbelievably low price. No wonder they've been in business for 15-20 years.",

The friendly staff keeps the drinks filled and the food is fresh and yummy, dispite the old, tired look of the place. Great lunch specials with egg roll!   If you are thinking of fast food and want to spend $5 on lunch . . . be smart and give yourself a giant upgrade for the same cash, . .  head to Big Heng",

I have searched for a good chinese restaurant have read reviews and still Im at a loss.  Is there no such thing in this area at all.  Drove quite a ways to try this one as I have many others, guess I will have to give chinese food up completely, just tired of being disappointed.",

    "text": "First off, loved this place. It's kind of a hole in a strip mall place but when you walk in, it's clean and everyone is friendly. My friend said she's been going here for years and said it was consistently good. She even had her rehearsal dinner here. Here? I'm kind of a Chinese food snob and didn't expect to like it as much as she did. But I did. The egg drop soup was great-they put a bunch of fried wonton strips on top and sometimes there is bigger pieces of egg white and it is just really good. I had the Hunan chicken, they said it was spicy--and by gum! it was :) And delicious. We had the flat noodles instead of the rice and it soaked up the sauce from the chicken--so, so good. And plenty of veggies with the chicken. My only hesitation is with the egg rolls that were kind of...clunky-almost like they had been made ahead of time and then warmed up. But I'll be back and try all the other goodness they serve. Oh! And it's good inexpensive Chinese food--2 for lunch, tea (a dollar extra) and a bit extra for the noodles vs rice and we got out for $16. Yes, I will be back--and you should go! Trust me :)",

The house fried rice is the bomb, tasty very tasty.  the wifey loved the the stuffed crab puffs.   The house sweet and sour, very delicious!!!  Beef broccoli, very tasty.  Egg soup is exquisite.

I am a sucker for chicken fried rice and it was of the best I've ever had! I enjoyed the potstickers, very meaty. My husband got the orange chicken and he felt that the breading could have been crispier, but really enjoyed the flavor. My guess is that it was made fresh and put in to-go containers which may have caused it to steam and soften by the time we got home. I found that the hot and sour soup was oddly too smoky in flavor, but very rich. All in all I am very happy with this experience and can't wait to go back and try other dishes!",

Finally someone picked up but the little bastard said Little Saigon was too busy to take to go orders at the time. So I went on yelp to find somewhere else in a pinch. I have seen this place before and the outside looks really suspect.  I ordered beef and broccoli, chicken and vegetable stir fry, and some crab puffs. Picked it up in 15 minutes. The lady was extremely nice. She gave me some extra hot sauce. Then when I left a tip she seemed as though she was shocked. She said to wait right here and came back with a bag of two free egg rolls. I guess people don't tip often for take out. Anyhow, I told my wife I sure hope the food was good cause I loved that little older lady in there.  Got home and it was pretty tasted. Everything was very hot, fresh, and had a pretty good flavor to it. The only thing I would have changed was a little spicier and a little less sauce but other than that it was great for pick up in a pinch.  Best of all. They gave me enough food to feed a family of five and all for under 20 bucks!! Now that's what I'm talking about. Left over Chinese for lunch tomorrow.",

So I decided to try big heng out. This place has a lot of great reviews and that is why I wanted to give it a shot I ordered the number one dinner special which was a cool crab puffs fried rice chow mein and sweet-and-sour pork. So I don't like the fried noodles that they had put on top of The chow mein but the chow mein was really good the sweet-and-sour pork was not too bad but the fried rice was just disappointing. So that meal alone made me two out of three items I ate. Now the crab puffs were good I enjoyed that but the eggroll just wasn't my kind. Overall I am full but I feel like I didn't eat That much of my plate it still felt pretty heavy when I threw it away which is why I am giving it three stars. I will try it again and order something different hopefully the fried rice will be better.",

    "text": "If you have a big appetite, Big Heng does not disappoint. The portions indeed are huge. The Yelp reviews here were accurate. I have never been an Egg Drop Soup fan, but because of my daughter's love for this American Chinese creation and the reviews on the soup here, I decided to try the place out. Once again, it did not disappoint. I like this soup so much that I will come back here to carry out this comfort food for sick family members. It was simply delicious. Don't forget to add pepper.  Tonight, we ordered the #1 Dinner Combo with Sweet and Sour Pork, Mooshu Pork Crepes, and Hunan Chicken. They portions are huge. The egg roll was standard American Chinese fare. The Crab Puff was tasty, little crab, lots of cream cheese. The lo mein had a lovely texture, but lacked distinction. The fried rice was okay. The Sweet and Sour Pork had too much batter and the sauce was a dousing of the store bought sauce that they serve with the egg roll. Because of the photographs, I thought the Mooshu Pork would taste more like Peking Duck. The crepe was authentic and so was the sauce that it came with. The filling however was a salty stir-fry of scallions, bean sprouts, fried egg and strips of non-descript pork. Finally, the Hunan Chicken had great ingredients but the gravy was overwhelmingly soya sauce and corn starch. They honored my request for no MSG or Monosodium Glutamate  The servers were fantastic, mostly Cantonese speakers. I felt like I was back in Hong Kong. They were friendly and helpful. When I requested to go boxes, they insisted on packing it up for me. They give me tips on where to get good dim sum. I really wanted to rate Big Heng higher. The service and soup was 5 stars. The rest of the main dishes were on a 2-3 star level. Hence, the 3 star rating. I will definitely return for the Egg Drop Soup.",

But I prefer much less soy sauce and vegetables and egg mixed in at a minimum.  But it is very good.  The price is right and the lunch special is hot and quick.",

We haven't been here in 10 years since we moved out of the area, but decided we had to make the trip over to  enjoy ourselves tonight. Their menu is pretty large and I liked that when ordering the pu pu platter they made it for three us of. Huge egg rolls, ribs, wings, chicken. All so delicious! Perfect crunch to the egg roll. My son ordered the shrimp noodle soup, I had egg drop soup and the happy Family, while my husband had Kung pao three. Everything came out perfect. Even better than I remember. I was even jealous of my sons shrimp noodle soup. It looked amazing. I can see that being s great soup for when you're feeling ill with the fresh veggies and broth. We will definitely make more trips. No way I can let another ten years go by.",

    "text": "We were coming home from our typical SR-89A jaunt through the back roads. We opted to not dine in Wickenburg, and made the decision to wait until we were in town for better food offerings.  Not sure how we happened to decide on dining here.  However, when I am presented with an option, I tend to fixate on it until I am satisfied. This time around, that was a big mistake.  I was driving the convertible this time around, and the ground clearance on this baby isn't much. Lo and behold, the intersection and the sidewalks that lead to Big Heng were all torn up. I found dust, pot holes, gravel, and shallow trenches -  all the things that I try to avoid when driving this particular car.  My wife was kind enough to give me an out. But, like I said, I was already determined to eat here. We pulled into the parking lot of this strip mall, and this is not the best of places to park.   There's Big Heng, a Laundromat, a Pawn Shop, and a neighborhood Bar filled with interesting characters - within and without. Such began the spectacle of trying to maneuver my car into one of the tight parking spaces, while a fair amount of bystanders were wondering who these \"fools\" were to come here!  We finally were parked. I close the convertible top, turned on the alarm, and made sure that my insurance information was up to date. By this time, we were ravenous. As you can see by our meal selection, we pretty much ordered more food than the two of us could possibly consume.   Our ultimate verdict? Although passable, their offerings were standard fare. There wasn't really anything that stood out, and nothing that gave a lasting impression that wowed our palates and senses. The Mongolian beef didn't have either the sultry spiciness of the hotter variety, nor the savory, smoky sweetness of the sort made with plum sauce. The lo mein was pretty good, but the house chicken would have been better if they'd let us have the sauce on the side. It was too soggy when presented to us. However, the food wasn't expensive, so there was that.  When we used to dine here ages ago, they always had the most interesting and distinctive dishes. This time around, it really left much to be desired. The only satisfying thing about our experience is that we walked away no longer hungry.",

Winnie was our server she was friendly and helpful. The restaurant has been in business for 22 years so they must be doing something right all these years. We will definitely be going back to eat there again. Our favorites was the Mongolian beef, the fried rice, the orange chicken which we requested for spicy and the low mein noodles.",

Man! The food was good and steaming hot! Not like pinky up Asian cuisine good, but 1990s, Westside of Phoenix Asian food, good!   The food had the right amount of greasiness to bean sprout ratio, and I didn't even mention portion size...I smoked and couldn't put a dent in this meal. These jokers gave me chicken lo mien, fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, an egg roll and a cream cheese ragoon all under $9  So, although their exterior menu is green, they're food is Gggggreat!

I admit that I judge Chinese food by NY/NJ standards, and I think the best and most authentic Chinese food is found on the coasts. We got a few dishes, the Szechuan chicken had the same sauce as the Kung Pao chicken, the soup was flavorless and the fried rice was just rice, some egg and soy sauce. The service was acceptable, so no points off there. I can compare this only to NJ mall food, like food court food. The price was the only thing worth a star, plus we did not get sick. So two stars. I do not need to go back. China Chili is worth the extra money. If you are in this neighborhood, there is also that place in Glendale in the strip mall. Name withheld, but food super good and a much better selection.",

They have a lot of items on the menu that's split up by the type of meat. Prices are pretty good for the amount of food you get.  The people here are great! Everyone does a good job here. The servers are always there to help you.  They are located in a very small strip mall at 75th and Peoria. Even if you don't see lines for parking you can park in the middle as well.

The service can be a little challenging with some employees due to the language barrier, but they are always attentive.  I took my kids there last Friday night and we had our dinner out within 3-4 minutes of ordering.  We had Sesame Chicken and Chicken Lo Mein, bother were great.  We saw the staff sing happy birthday to a customer, first in English, then a Chinese song that I'm assuming is typically sung during birthdays.  I hope they keep up the delicious food!",

Good soup and you get an egg till and a main course. Bring someone and order more to share because everything I've ever ordered is really good. My advice is try the orange chicken it's really really sweet and different from most places so you need to order something spicy too, to kind if compliment the sweet. Also you have to try the sweet n sour shrimp (sauce on the side) it's so good!! Definitely one of my local faves!",

Their lunches are insanely cheap and the lunch options are plenty. I like the teriyaki, and their veggie dishes like the Hunan chicken. I like to ask them to make it extra spicy everytime. I have also tried their orange chicken. Its pretty tasty and not your usual Panda Express orange chicken. It really seems like real oranges in that sauce. Lunch comes with soup, egg roll, two wontons w/ meat btw and fried rice (substitute soft noodles for $1). I gotta say though that they have the best Hot Chili Oil i have ever had in any chinese place, they really ferment it. Becareful with their spicy mustard, its has the wasabi effect if you know what i mean. Service was excellent as always, super kind and attentive. Big Heng is one of those comfort chinese food placess",

    "text": "Found this place today by Googling \"$5 lunch Peoria AZ\"...and the Yelp link popped up.  It was a bit out of my way, but I had the time today, so I thought, \"what the heck!  It got good reviews!\"  From the looks of the building and surrounding businesses, I was a bit leary, but most Yelpers gave this place 5 stars, so I had to give it a try. (that's why we \"yelp\" this stuff, right?\"  The place was much nicer inside than judging from the outside. It was pretty nice inside - not dark, dreary, or stinky!  Quite the opposite!   The place was bustling with activity; waitresses were busy serving and seating the lunch crowd.  The place was hopping and continued to throughout my 30 minute lunch.  After placing my order of Moo Goo Gui Pan, a bowl of egg-drop soup quickly arrived (it did not mention soup on the menu).  It was just ok.  It was simply broth and egg. No standard peas or carrots in my bowl. It had little to no taste, but a bit of Soy sauce fixed that.  The thing I DID like about the soup, was that it came PIPPING hot, little fried wontons on top of it, and served with WARM sweet and sour sauce - and my favorite kind too! (I like the red, not the orange sauce).  That was a nice bonus!    My food was delivered very fast and again, PIPPING HOT.  The serving size was nice and the presentation was nice too.  Came with an egg-roll and one fried wonton.  The flavor was VERY good...nice and garlic'ly!  Extra points for FRESH mushrooms, too!  The waitress never came back to check on me and no hot mustard was on any of the tables nor offered to me...tried to catch a waitress, but was unsuccessful.  The food, ambiance, flavor, service was very good. I would recommend this place...and the price was $4.85!!!  Since this place was a bit further than I like to drive at lunchtime, I will stick my my old fav, Shangri-La on 59th Ave.   Much better soup and not in the 'hood.  I'll gladly pay the extra buck.  If you are in the neighborhood of Peoria Ave and 75th Ave....stop in any give this place a try.",

She even suggested what to order next time.   I'm not a real big Chinese food fan so I really can't compare their food to other spots. We ordered the crab puffs which were tasty but I've had much better. Orange beef was pretty good but not spicy enough for my taste. It came with steamed or fried rice. I added a side of lo mein noodles because I was craving them. Those were really good. Hubby ordered shrimp lo mein and really enjoyed his meal. Serving sizes were really big and prices were reasonable in my opinion.   We will definitely return. It's a diamond in the rough.",

    "text": "I have to admit, that, over the years, my love of Chinese food has waned.  I'm just not used to eating such heavy food anymore and for the most part have replaced Chinese restaurants with Vietnamese and Thai (though there's no comparison between the latter and Chinese).  However, after reading the reviews on here, which said this restaurant was the closest thing to the NYC version, I couldn't resist trying it.  Having grown up on Long Island, I had my fair share of Chinese restaurants and I, too, think the best in the country are to be found there (and, to a lesser extent, San Francisco).  The star of this place is the pu-pu platter.  Hands down the best for a mere $9.90 for two people.  Spare ribs with plenty of meat on them; large -- but albeit greasy -- egg rolls; skewered meats that in no way resemble most of the pu-pu platters in the Valley, where, if you're lucky, your skewered meat and ribs will resemble something some other customer ate 80% of the way through and was kept out of the garbage to be put into some poor schmuck's order the next day (and that's if you're LUCKY; don't ask what it'll look and taste like, if you aren't!).    The hot n sour soup certainly doesn't skimp on meat and other additions to it.  But while it was good, it didn't wow me.  For the main dishes, we had Kung Pao Three and the Emperor Chicken.  Both were a bit salty, but that was our fault:  we don't use salt at home, so --- as you've read in my other reviews --- we should've remembered to say \"no MSG or salt, please!\"  Other than that, big portions; big pieces of meat.  Just be aware that, unlike kung pao dishes, the Emperor Chicken has NO vegetables in it (if that's important to you).  Service was stellar and I had no problems leaving a 20% tip on the total (subtotal and tax combined).  The server was friendly and gave lots of advice.  In fact, I would describe her, too, as being typical New York:  we can be very standoffish; but once we get to know someone or want to get to know someone, we can be very familiar and overly -- but genuinely -- friendly very quickly.  The restaurant is very well lit, but not obnoxiously so.  I don't know why -- no doubt some personal, buried memory -- but well-lit Chinese restaurants always remind me of the Christmas holidays, so it felt warm and comfortable to be in so well-lit a restaurant.  Overall, while the food  -- with the exception of the pu-pu platter -- didn't wow us, this place definitely ranks up there in the best of Chinese restaurants in the Valley.  Well worth the drive from Goodyear and its \"late\" hours are an absolute godsend in a \"city\" where most restaurants close down by 8pm or 9pm, even on a Saturday!",

We ordered the egg rolls, egg drop soup, house fried rice, moo goo gai pan, and cashew chicken.

My wife is more concerned with cleanliness of an establishment then the quality of the food. Which actually work hand-in-hand with each other. Her take on cleanliness is non fatty grissley pieces of chicken, shady chunks of beef etc. Big Heng passes her test. Not only is the food nice and clean, but it's All made to order. The sesame chicken, even after my 12 minute drive back to the house, stays crispy. The egg rolls are divine, and the hot and sour soup is amazeballs. If you spend $25 tell them you have a coupon for free crab cheese wontons. It's on their to-go menu that you can detach. When we want good Chinese and don't want to spend PF changes money, it's Big Heng time!",
