Then returned a few minutes later to get our order. We placed it. I ordered Huevos Rancheros and the wife ordered a Cajun Omelette. Both were wonderful and had lots of flavor. Your meals  come with a Baker's Basket, three different types of mini muffins fresh and warm, all three were great. These are brought to you before your meal while you are waiting. Our food came within minutes of finishing the basket. Quick, great service and food. We will return again. Great first experience.",

    "text": "Went here for breakfast for the first time. Took my mom and my 8 year old son.  We waited a while for a table but it wasn't terrible for Sunday morning. The waitress was nice. My food was OK, my over-medium eggs were a little overcooked. My mom had a waffle and she liked it. My son had pancakes eggs and bacon.  He said the scrambled eggs tasted funny and so he only ate a couple of bites. Six hours later here he is throwing up and having diarrhea. Sounds like food poisoning to me. Those scrambled eggs must have been bad.  **UPDATE:  My son is doing better today, but my mother was nauseous this morning.  We hadn't been together until yesterday at brunch in a few weeks so there is no way they passed any type of virus from one to the other that quickly -- this must have been the food.  Disappointing because this place gets 4 stars on Yelp.",

This place really has it when it comes to the \"homemade\" meal. I like the new super \"Starbucks\" type of new age places but I feel they put all the money into the facade and loose it in the food, quality, and staff.   Without the constant bean counters and investors sitting over your shoulder this place has the time to make your food to order. The staff is kind and very helpful too. Also great coffee constantly refilled.   There was a small problem with our meal and within 5 minutes there was a replacement plate and some extra stuff to take home. :)  All things considered this was a great dining experience and I would recommend this place and its people to serve you great meals!   Love it and will be back!",

A lot of their breakfast menu items come with a fresh basket of delicious muffins.  I have tried the mushroom, ham and onion omelette and it tasted very good. The Cooks Combo is the best bang for your buck and comes with eggs, pancake, and sausage or bacon. Coffee and orange juice are both decent. Serive is consistently good but they are pretty busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  So make sure to go early or call to put your name on the list. We once waited 20 min outside in the Phoenix summer heat.",

After all, the AZ Repugnant rated this place as its #2 pick (behind Matt's Big Breakfast) as the top place to have breakfast in the Valley.  As the six friends who read my reviews know, I've never understood the hoopla around Matt's Big Breakfast - it's OK - but geesh -- #1?  What happened to The Farm at South Mountain -- now that's a unique-fantastic-organic-only-can-find-in-Phoenix-Phoenician experience.  Sigh - but I digress...  Ross and I enter \"Kiss the Cook\".  The interior is special - hard wood floors, mismatched seats and tables -- we both say it reminds us of a country store.  \"Nana\" is the one who shows us to our seats.  My hopes rise and I start thinking that AZ Republic scored on it's review.  We order.  Service is friendly, coffee was a little weak, but Ross loves the OJ.  Then the food arrives.    The presentation is impressive.  My omelet was TALL!  FLUFFY!  Both Ross and I were wowed!  Then I cut into it and it was runny, soggy, and tepid (not really warm).  The waitress came by, asked how everything was (and she seemed to really mean it versus the polite ask but they don't really care to know the answer question that usually comes from waiters).  I told her about the omelet and she offered for them to recook it.    She came back with my same omelet that must have been thrown in the microwave.  The top was steaming but interior now warmer - but not yet warm.   I picked around the soggy parts and ate the top (that was Ross' suggestion).  The waitress came back again, concerned that I wasn't eating enough.  She was so sweet.  I didn't want to make her feel badly.  But she sent the manager over -- which I thought was very proactive customer service.  The manager (maybe the owner?), stopped by and asked me what I thought might be wrong and offered up that it might be the egg beaters.  She did not offer me something else (but did suggest the next time I go in I should try the Pecan Cinnamon Roll).  And, when we got our bill, the omelet was still on it (they didn't comp my meal).  We paid and no complaint.  I don't expect to be comped, I just thought the experience with the manager was interesting.",

But it was funny enough to take a picture.  Pancakes are Superb.  Light, fluffy, the right temperature, not DRY, and not too soggy... YUM!!!  Their famous potatoes are pretty good, not the best but pretty good.  Regular eggs are ok.  The omelettes are fluffy. The egg yolk ones are firm, the egg white ones are a little too fluffy almost runny.  They have a bunch of other options on the menu like make your own omelettes, huevos rancheros, sandwiches.  Not overally oily. Price:  Decent.  About $5 for 2 eggs, muffins, 2 biscuits with gravy, gradmas potatoes.  About $7 to $8 for make your own omelette.   Decor:  I love the ambience here, it is really quaint, not old scary really nostalgic, but more prairie, baskets hanging, green vines, white linen, and daisy flower kind of feel.  Has a patio Service:  Very good.  Super nice and attentive.  Fast service.  Ask us if we needed anything a lot.",

I love how stuff did not match perfectly, like the chairs and the plates.  They were actually closed when we arrived at 1:06 pm, but they gladly encouraged us to come in. The Hostess was a young lady that had a down to earth friendly personality and even complimented my daughter on her necklace. Our server was just as lovely and was very attentive the entire time.  I ordered the eggs benedict ($7.50) and my daughter ordered a turkey sandwich on sourdough ($4.50). They delivered the delicious muffins that were mentioned in the previous post...we had banana nut and zucchini muffins and they were sooooo yummy.  The food came out in no time at all and was very very pleased with the benedict and the potatoes that came with. The eggs were perfectly poached and hollandaise sauce was delish.The potatoes were just like I make at home, perfectly seasoned with  little crispy pieces here and there. I was impressed because I have paid a lot more for this elsewhere and did taste nearly as good. The daughter's turkey sandwich was stacked high with thinly sliced turkey and cheese and she was also very satisfied.   I will definetly return here and would recommend trying it if you are in the area. The service and the food were both great and that is no easy task.",

The quaint little restaurant is decorated with country antiques and most of them are for sale. It reminds me of a place you would find in Prescott.  I have had a few things on the menu and have always been delighted. The coffee is a little week, but then again, I start each day with a quad espresso so it may be unfair for me to judge.  While you wait for breakfast they bring out a variety of VERY tasty muffins and bread... so, so tasty!!!!  Good service and prices. No complaints from me :)",

    "text": "So you have to love breakfast.  It is a great meal that really begs for creativity.  There are so few places that have creative breakfasts (Palette was one) but most places just do the standard fare.  That would be Kiss the Cook.  Nothing special about it.  No magic applewood smoked turkey sausage with kumquat glaze, no french waffels - just your standard stuff.  They do it well though.  Think of it as basic breakfast without the grease.    The waitresses are great and have a ton of personality.  They really make this place a Four Star establishment.  The mini muffins that come before your meal is always a saving grace and they are the perfect size to tide you over till your food arrives.  That being said, your food won't take too long and you will get plenty of it.    I tried the french toast with a side of ham.  The toast was decent; with a hint of cinnamon.  Nice but not amazing.  The ham was a really good size and it tasted damn good.  The fresh squeezed OJ wasn't as good as Matt's but it was better than something from a carton.   I'd go back here if I was out in Glendale for breakfast.  A great place with a ton of character.  The food isn't overwhelming but it is good enough for breakfast.",

We sat outside on the patio, much more comfortable than the crowded indoors, on a nice Winter Sunday (the only downside to being outside is some traffic noise which I think is tolerable).  Breakfast highlights were GREAT ham, pancakes, omelets.  Highly touted pecan sweet rolls and muffin basket were fine, but overhyped. Potatoes were fine but nothing special.  Prices are very reasonable.   Oh, and the waitresses are super nice. Always tip well!",

    "text": "It's Mother's Day and I knew restaurants would be crowded.  Imagine my surprise when this restaurant says they take reservations!  They say it was a 45 minute wait at that time, so I put my name down for 45 minutes.  We hurried to get there on time and they said it would be 20 minutes for a table... pardon me?  You said it was a reservation and now there's a 20 minute wait ON TOP of the reservation time?  After waiting 35 minutes with 2 very hungry children (I asked for some muffins for them and was given one for each of the kids, and then a waitress saw them cranky still and gave them another one, which was nice) we were finally seated.  The hostess asked if the table was fine and I had to bite the insides of my cheeks to keep from saying, \"It'll have to do because I'm not waiting longer for another table!\"  We saw people that got there after us in 4 party tables get seated before us because they were complaining.  WTF?  If they can't wait their turn, there's a Sonic down the street with no wait.  Anyway, we were seated and ordered quickly.  My 6 year old got the Cooks Combo, my 3 year old got the yogurt parfait (we changed the fruit to strawberries and bananas because they used honeydew, cantaloupe and pineapple in theirs, which sounded gross and a concoction that would result in curdled yogurt if the pineapple was fresh!)  I got the crab cake eggs Benedict (it was on special), and my husband got eggs with turkey sausage and potatoes.  We were given a basket of cold muffins, which were tasty but not piping hot like Missy's review.  The food came out quickly, which was surprising because they were quite busy.  Our waitress was a very nice lady and welcomed the change in the yogurt parfait (I really hate when waitresses get snippy if you change something very slight!)  Everyone was happy with their food.  I was mildly annoyed that the eggs weren't poached properly, they were overdone, resulting in no glorious egg yolk mixing with the Hollandaise, but other than that I would order that dish again.  We probably won't be back again though because it's a bit of a drive, a long wait, and I felt like I was stuck in a Seinfeld episode (a mesh of the car reservation episode and the Chinese restaurant episode).  The service was friendly, the food was good, but if you can't keep reservations, don't take them and sure as heck don't offer them!",

I would have given a 3 star but used the bathroom before leaving.  Well, I went into the bathroom anyways... didn't use it.  Totally disgusting and I have a feeling the kitchen isn't much better.

The coffee is so weak any flavor you get is from the added cream.   The eggs benedict  was over cooked to the point where the yellow solid. So, I sent it back and was treated to runny whites the next time.   Clearly this is something they need to work on.        A few months ago we experienced the same exact problem which is why it took so long for me to give them another chance in the first place.  I, for one will not be going back nor can I, in good faith, recommend them.  Seriously, and I can't believe I am saying this, but Denny's is better.  Mimi's is REALLY my recommendation for a decent breakfast at decent prices. Last note, the staff was okay, but I ended up getting charged for the two coffees we had while waiting for food we never ate.",

It used to be a cool dive for breakfast.  Not any more.  The two comments about slapping the cook and firing the cook are spot on.  The real punch in the gut was that there was a poster on the door that was begging patrons to go online and request that they be casted on DDD.  I emailed the link but instead of asking them to use Kiss the cook on an episode, I urged them to avoid eating there at all costs.  Get it together.",

We got seated right away, not crowded but then again it's a Thursday morning. Our waitress really didn't have a personality. I notice there are 3 servers and the other two seem really attentive to there tables.   Food was good, not overly impressed. The grandmas basket was cute a little different. Will I come back? Yes if I was in the area. Not gonna drive out of my way.",

It's great for groups, bringing you're significant other or you're family here. There food is so delicious especially there little mini muffins but in the menu I recommend the toasted wheat B.L.T sandwich with egg overhard inside the sandwich with a side of lays chips. Omg it's so yummy but other stuff on the menu is also yummy as well. Also the servers are great but if you want someone very reliable & fast I would ask for Steven or Michelle. And if you ever go on the weekends I would call in and tell them to put you on the waiting list so you don't have to wait long when you get there. But overall if want a good food for breakfast and brunch I would come here Cause this place is the best.",

I've tried the French Toast,  waffles pancakes and chicken salad sandwich and they are all heavenly. Depending what you are in the mood for I'd vouch for any of those.

The best part is the muffins you get upon being seated and the freshly squeezed orange juice.  This place attracts a lot of older people.  We were probably one of the youngest in the room.",

Sausage is not too salted (which is usually the case at other places) and eggs are perfectly poached in a way that yolk is still runny but doesn't spill all out when cut. The mini muffins offered before the meals are ridiculously delicious - not too sweet, not too oily, and not to filling. I would definitely come back if I visit Arizona again.",

We can all use a little kitsch with our breakfasts and Kiss the Cook has it in spades. Mismatched chairs and plates mixed in with country style antiques add some interest to your just awakening eyes.   The food is tasty and homey. They start you off with a lovely basket of mini muffins (bran, strawberry and zucchini) which are piping hot and yummy. The zucchini is my favorite. They serve their coffee in clear glass mugs which I love because you get to watch the cream and coffee mix together. The food is really solid, I haven't had anything I didn't like yet. Their eggs benedict is quite good and their pancakes are really good.  The waitresses are friendly and quick with your order. The prices are fair. Now that its not an oven outside the patio is open so wait times have improved. In fact, over the weekend there wasn't a wait at all. This is a great, locally owned breakfast place to try out.",

First, the food is good,  I have eaten there twice with a friend and both times our food was cooked to our specifications, was tasty, and was served quickly.   This is no austere setting.  The tables and chairs are all different, there are shelves holding all manner of things ranging from older kitchen ware, cutsie signs and at the register, they sell home made dog treats.  The food is well portioned, and the coffee was pretty darn good.      The only reason this is not a 5 is that the entry way is cramped and confusing.  They are doing the check out and greeting area in the same small place.  It does not work well for me.",

I recently went two weekends in a row and both times did not dissapoint. The first time I got their Cajun Style Eggs Benedict. I ordered mine over medium. The eggs came out perfect and the sauce they use in lieu of hollandaise was to die for. I mean I just want to smother all my food with it. It was the right amount of spicy and the right amount of flavor. The breakfast comes with their world famous mini muffins. The second time I got their traditional breakfast with pancakes. The PANCAKES are amazing. Fluffy to perfection and just topped off with enough butter. I also ordered a waffle and let me tell you. I loved the Waffle. It wasn't overtly sweet and it was crispy on the outside. They have applewood smoked bacon that is pretty delicious. The only negative thing that I can say about this place is that their coffee sucks. Sometimes you get those clear glass coffee cups and you can see straigh through it with coffee in it. I love strong strong coffee and even Denny's serves stronger coffee than this. The service at this mom and pop place is amazing. Every single employee makes you feel at home. They treat you like family and are great at making food recomendations. Overall, this place is good, cheap and delicious. Don't let the long line scare you away because it sure does get busy.",

The place smelled like coffee and muffins. The menu had a lot of tasty dishes I would love to try next time I visit, like crepes and pancakes but I went with an omelette and home fries. I enjoyed my food. The food, the service, the atmosphere all felt like the staff  cares about the experience the patrons have.  Did I mention the muffins? They offer a complimentary basket of mini muffins for the table with certain dishes (I think that's how it works, I'm not sure).  The muffins were warm, moist and delicious. The coffee is served in glass cups.  I prefer mugs but I appreciate that they have a signature thing.  I wish the coffee was better but it certainly wasn't bad. I also liked that they offer flavored coffee.  The place was full when we visited.  It's a really nice, laid back restaurant and I look forward to coming back. I would have come sooner but when I would see their signage from the car as we drove by I was worried because it seemed a bit outdated.  I didn't know what that would mean if we went inside.  Upon visiting, my experienced proved to be very positive.  I like this place.",

When you arrive you sign in like some sort of Drs office, I am positive that some folks that came into line after me were seated first, the wait staff knew them by name.  After being seated we waited several minutes to be seen, (no surprise) they were very busy. Once we were seen we had already decided what we wanted to eat but the waitress took our drink order and simply turned and walked away.  No \"I'll be right back\" or a single word.  Then we got the basket of muffins and I had one and could not tell what kind it was and it was dry.  Then the coffee arrived in a liquor glass, clear,  the coffee was so see through that I am able to view the room by looking thru it.  The food arrived and there were a few potato's but not many on the side and a huge omelet. The issue was the menu itself.  Breakfast was eggs and more eggs with some small number of other choices to go along with the eggs and more eggs.  I asked for bacon on my omelet and while it may have been there in spirit it was not there at all in flavor and I saw none in my omelet. Also the omelet eggs seemed to be the kind that come in the cartoon not the actual shell.  I have no idea what the waitress's name was as it was never offered, however in truth there is not a need for that I guess, but still.",

It's very cute on the inside and they have outside sitting (not that you'd want too in 117 weather). They have a covered patio where customers can wait.   As far as the seating, it was quick even though it was busy and extremely small on the inside. Our server was polite and friendly and I really appreciate that about busy businesses.   The food was really good and the apple smoked bacon was huge and crispy. The pancakes had a great flavor to it. I didn't have coffee but I noticed they serve coffee in clear glasses. I thought that was cool.  Anyway... overall good experience and will be back!",

Meals come with a basket of mini muffins that are so good you'll have to be careful that you don't fill up before your meal comes out. I've had the Buttered Cinnamon Roll with Pecan's and I dream about it it's so good! Melts in your mouth, fresh and delicious :) I typically order the eggs benedict but we've tried the biscuits and gravy, pancakes and this past trip my friend had the crepes which were sensational!

Unfortunately this place doesn't seem to have it, which is sad because it is very close to my work and we were looking for a good place to order our breakfast from in the mornings. The first time I went I was disappointed because I thought they delivered, but I chalked that up to a misunderstanding so no big deal. As I said they are very close to my job so picking up is not an issue. What was the issue is that when I arrived no one acknowledged me. There was someone there at the hostess desk that I was standing in front of, but she just stood there and kept doing what she was doing, no greeting or anything. Then she answered a call and took an order and then just walked away. I stood there for a little while until she came back and then acknowledged me. That rubbed me the wrong way, but again, I let it go because even though the restaurant wasn't busy at the time, doesn't mean they weren't busy with to go orders or something.  But today was the last straw, I called in to place another to go order so that my office could sample the lunch menu. The lady who answered the phone immediately asked if I could hold and I did for about 5 minutes and they hung up on me. This upset me, but I figured it was a mistake. So I called back and when the lady answered and asked what I would like to order. Before I placed my order I wanted to mention my issue with what had just happened. When I told her all I got was a kurt \"sorry\" and \"you wanted to place a to go order right so what do you want\". I decided not to place the order because I while I respect people in the service industry, I cannot respect or patron a restaurant whose staff has a complete disregard for its customers. Unacceptable.",

Once my dad caught on to the fluffiness of their omelets it became a family favorite.  It had been years since I had been back but the husband and I were in the mood for breakfast and since we are westsiders and slow to wake up on the weekend we knew we wouldn't be able to make it to the east valley to try something different.  Matt had never been to Kiss the Cook so it seemed like the perfect choice, the fact that there was a meat lover's omelet on special confirmed that choice. When he asked to sub the green onions in the omelet for something else, he was greeted with enthusiasm and encouragement from the waitress, \"Yes! you are paying for it, might as well have something you like in it!\"  This instantly won over my husband who often asks to sub or omit ingredients.  The baker's basket is a great touch and I have always had great friendly service. Our food came out promptly, fresh, and our drinks never ran dry. Best part we were in and out in 35 minutes which helped us still be able to enjoy a full day of errands, despite not rolling out of bed until 10am.",

It was ok, and probably rates somewhere in the middle of that list. The decor is sort of homey and random with a dash of countrification; we were seated on the patio at our request and received good, patient, attentive service. It won't break the bank to eat here, but everything is a la carte, so don't expect any sides to come with your meal. The beverages are overpriced for the amount given (almost $3 for a 12 ounce cup of fountain lemonade? half filled with ice? O_o) but the food was decent. It's a unique place but not special, if you get my drift. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but f you're in Glendale and have a hankering, give it a try.",

I have been eating here since high-school and find this little family owned restaurant charming.  In addition to their regular menu (you can order breakfast or lunch any time), they always have three or four lovely specials. Generally, one is any omnivores dream, one takes fruit to a whole new level, and the other features one of their baked products done up to the nines.  My personal favorite is the \"build your own\" omelet. The ingredients are all super fresh, the omelet is always stuffed, and the house potatoes that are served on the side are very yummy (although I would like them done a little more on the crunchy side). My sisters favorite is the Snow Pea omelet. She swears it is the perfect combination of crunch and fluff!  Each meal starts out with a little basket of mini-muffin heaven. Alas the mini biscuits are no longer served, but man oh man are those zucchini muffins out of this world.  So you may be wondering, after all these raves, what are the down sides... well on occasion there is a little more butter on the bottom of the plate than I am comfortable with and although they are supposed to be famous, their sticky buns aren't all that special.  If you are looking for decent food, served with a smile, in a unique environment - you will definitely enjoy your visit to Kiss the Cook. Oh and there is that little chocolate kiss that leaves you wanting more...  : )",

    "text": "We weren't in the mood to go to some boring chain and we weren't having a whole lot of luck searching for breakfast places because we had already been to most of them.  After getting a little deeper in the search, the husband suggested this place.    I was immediately surprised when we walked in by the sheer amount of tables and chairs they managed to pack into this tiny little restaurant.  This is definitely not a place to come and eat if you have personal space issues.  While it was extremely busy inside we were immediately seated at a tiny table for two and greeted by a sweet lady named Sue.  I ordered the Country Breakfast with Bacon so I could try a little of everything that this place had to offer.  My meal came with 2 eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, fried potatoes, and the awesome little muffin basket everyone has talked about.  The little muffin basket served pre-meal like bread at an Italian restaurant is why I give this place 4 stars instead of just 3.  Everything else was average but good.  The prices were fair, the amount of food was plentiful, and the service was quick and friendly.  I could definitely see myself coming back here if I am in this part of town.",

When I got to Kiss the Cook, I was pleasantly pleased to see that it was a free standing building (guess I'm easily impressed) with plenty of parking and even a cute patio!  The menu was full of typical breakfast favorites including omelets, pancakes, and hearty breakfast indulgences.    5-star service!  Our coffee was never low and our water glasses were always replenished.  The decor inside was similar to my Michigan grandma's basement which made everything seem extremely relaxed.  As other Yelpers noted, the muffin basket is a highlight.  Once you order you are greeted with a little warm basket with several different types of miniature muffins of love.  mmm  I love that when you get your bill (cheap too by the way!), you are greeted with a real Hershey's kiss!  These are the touches that are always forgotten with chain restaurants  I know I will return- totally worth a try if you are on this side of town",

    "text": "As I write this review, I'm trying to think why I wouldn't give this place 5 stars. Today was my first time visiting this restaurant which is conveniently located less than a mile from my new beau's home. So we'll start with four stars until I have at least 5 visits under my culinary belt.  In the 9 and 3/4 years that I have resided in Arizona, for the first time, I have found a breakfast place I can call \"home\".  Let me start with the bacon.   When I ponder going vegetarian, I am only halted from executing said diet merely because there is no way on Mother Nature's Great Green Earth that I could/should/would ever give up my beloved pork strip. All bacon is not created equal but KTC has found one of the blessed thick cut smoked bacon brands that surpass most. (Costco has a great maple bacon from Canada if you trust my bacon expertise) I and my table mates were pleased.  We all ordered the day's special: Thick-cut bacon, eggs & potato cakes($7.45). Yummers! My love ordered an additional order of french toast ($4.50) with blueberries ($1.50) which he generously shared with I and his brother.  The baby-sized muffins were a nice, tasty, fresh-tasting start and didn't ruin my appetite for the main meal.  There were fresh flowers on the tables which I think is a great homey touch. The food presentation was visually pleasing. The orange juice ($2.25, large) was fresh and pulpy just like I like it. If it wasn't fresh squeezed it certainly tasted that way.  I didn't order coffee cause it was \"see-through\" and I like it dark & strong.  I agree with one of the other posters that the food is hella fresh tasting and this is what separates it from any of the pathetic chain restaurants its been compared to. (Incidentally, if Denny's is a place you frequent, that shit should have tasted like manna from the Heavens for you).  Did you ever have bacon & eggs that tasted like old recycled lard? Ick. That's what's missing here and that's what makes Kiss The Cook special.  The service was awesome. The staff are friendly and humorous.  The decor is country cute and mismatched as one poster pointed out which lends to its grandmotherly charm.  You get a \"kiss\" with your bill.  Actually, I just realized, that I would give this place 5 stars if it used Organic ingredients sourced mostly from Local Farms. That can be hard when the meals you offer do not have ingredients that are available locally.  If your palate longs for breakfast food made with \"Love\" and flavor, support Local Arizona small business and try Kiss the Cook!",

It's probably because of their wonderful basket of delicious mini muffins! I seriously loved all of them and could have finished a whole basket by myself easily! They had lemon poppy, pistachio, and cinnamon? I think.  The first 2 were my favs.   Service It wasn't super busy when we came, which was a Saturday afternoon around 12. The waiter that took our order was really nice and funny! I forgot his name.. He was also really attentive so thank you for that! He refilled our water without us asking, checked up on us, cracked a couple jokes. It was nice for us out of town people.   Food You MUST get the Cajun eggs Benedict. It's the right amount of spicy, and was super amazing!  Biscuits and gravy- it didn't have any sausage and was okay... I didn't really care for it.  Yogurt parfait- loved the fruits and yogurt! Really refreshing.  Pecan pancake? I forgot the name. It was drowned in some sweet liquid/syrup. I had a bite and it was Waaaay too sweet for me and I love sweet! Maybe better for dessert rather than breakfast/brunch.   Super cheap for 6 people compared to Cali! It was $60 without tip... Well worth the money!",

Went last weekend, got two eggs and bacon with potatoes. The eggs were cooked well but flavorless... the whole plate was flavorless. I broke up pieces of bacon and mixed it with the potatoes and put the eggs on top.... still not good. The potatoes were undercooked, crunchy still, and had no seasoning whatsoever, it was just a bland pile of grease... yuck. On top of that, we waited over 30 minutes for a table. I don't think I'll be back, there are too many good breakfast places around to continue to go to a bad one.  PS The service here continues to be very friendly, so that is a plus.",

Mini muffin basket was a great because while I like to have a savory breakfast most of the time I always want a little something sweet in there, but I don't want a whole side of pancakes or French toast. So this was nice. They weren't amazing muffins, but they were all I needed. Breakfast came out fast. I like more unique options on the menu. My husband got the new Orleans omelet and that was delicious. I had the omelet that was in special. They were both Uber fluffy, cheesy and delicious. The home fries were also seasoned well and very tasty.. No bland potatoes here. Overall I would say a 3.5 but that's not an option in here. If I was in the area I would go back in a heartbeat, but I wouldn't make a trek across the city for it.",

Our waitress was warm and friendly. She was kind, welcoming and service was outstanding. I ordered the seafood omelette with home fried potatoes and vanilla flavored coffee. My husband ordered the corned beef hash, fried eggs and home fried potatoes with coffee.  My son ordered the special: chicken sliders with potato chips. Our friendly waitress brought us a hot from the oven basket of mini muffins.  It was a treat to eat here and we will be back. I loved the restaurant and dining area--it's very quaint and comfortable.",

The waitresses all have that mom-like-feel. What is that you ask? They were all aged enough to be my mom. Super adorable and sweet. I felt so catered to and loved on by complete strange older woman.   As for the food; Menu is very simple and pretty much comfort food or anything that will fill you up and make you feel like a stuffed sausage. Upon being seated you are greeted with a smile and a basket filled with their house muffins. I ate one or five. I cant remember, but they were warm, moist and delicious. Overall, portions are very generous. Food had great flavor.   It's pretty easy. If you want a good breakfast or lunch and you are in the area this is definitely a place to visit. They have an outdoor pet friendly area, spacious indoor seating and a wonderful vibe.  Oh, and when you are provided with the check, you are given \"kisses\" Hershey Kisses.   Great for a meet up with friends, family or solo date.   XOXO B",

I enjoyed the laid back feeling of the homey decore and really appreciated the peace and quiet of this restaurant compared to a lot of the obnoxiously loud and chaotic breakfast spots out there. My wife and I had their flavored coffee, on this day it happened to be a Hawaiian hazelnut which I really enjoyed. The mini muffins and butter were a nice touch and were just enough to not take away from the breakfast entrees. My review would have been 4 stars, but while ordering I asked our server if the corn beef hash was made in house which she said it was turned out to be canned. Not terrible, the meal was still good, but had I been informed properlyI would have ordered differently. Service was great otherwise and I will definitely return to try the New Orleans omelet with Cajun hollandaise. The description looked really good so I'll look forward to that upon my return.",

It went downhill after that.  I ordered the Cajun eggs Benedict.  The eggs were cooked nicely but the Cajun sauce just didn't taste right.  When I was in NOLA the sauce had a much better flavor and depth.  This one missed the spot.  The kielbasa tasted more like hot dogs.   Sad to say, if it weren't for the muffins, I would have only given 1 star.  The mini muffins are worth a trip but that's it.",

    "text": "I have now been here 3 times.  This place is sort of an icon in Glendale and I had been hearing that I had to go here since I moved here 17 years ago.  The first time I was here was Mothers Day. and I ordered the special breakfast of chicken crepes with a fruit bowl.  It was cold, the spinach had the texture of shoe leather, the Alfredo sauce had separated then formed a skin.  The fruit bowl it came with was ok as was the coffee and the mini muffins with butter were really good.'  The next time I went for lunch and had that day's special which was a  hot turkey sandwich with potato salad.  The sandwich was ok. The potato salad was bland but the seasoned salt on the table made it ok.   This last time I had the Cooks breakfast of two pancakes, two eggs, two sausages (or bacon) and I added some potatoes.  The breakfast was lukewarm.  The pancakes and potatoes were pretty good, the eggs and sausage were just ok.  As noted before the mini muffins served with real butter were really good.  Ever body I encountered was pleasant.  The place is looking a bit worn.  When I was there the place was one to two thirds full.  I noticed this last trip the line of chairs and the coffee station outside were missing.  I fully understand that the banter between the waitresses and the regular customers is one of the things that brings people back, I just wish it didn't cause my food to be served lukewarm as I saw other plates served that were still steaming.  I gave it a 3 but it is a pretty weak 3 and although I would go there again if somebody else picked it I doubt it will make it into my regular rotation.",

The decor is really cute and country. There population of customers were mostly elderly, getting the feeling they are regulars and have been coming to this spot for years. My server was friendly and prompt. I asked for suggestions and she gave me an idea on what is best here. The wifi wasn't accessible, they didn't have the password. I ordered the eggs Benedict. It was drenched in  sauce so so so bad the biscuit was soggy and I had a hard time distinguishing any other flavors outside the hollandaise sauce. I thought, well geez they just make it that way and then as I tried to stomach this dish noticed a lady next to me had ordered the same thing and hers was not swimming in hollandaise sauce. If my waitress had been paying attention maybe she could have prevented the order from coming out or if she would have taken some time to ask how everything was she could have learned about how displeasing this dish truly was.",

She actually tried to break down market prices of pork chops to us...wth???  The special of the day, which was on display on the front chalkboard sign, was a two pork chop breakfast for $11.95. I ordered that and was informed they only had one pork chop left. I told them I would take the one and our party  (6) all ordered.  Our food was blah, as was the coffee. When our check arrived I was charged for a different breakfast ($10.95)plus a side meat of 1 pork chop ($7)!! When we pointed out how this didn't make sense the owner told us since we didn't get the 2 pork chops we were charged market price for 1. We pointed out the sign and were told it didn't apply even though it fell on them. She had the nerve to remove 40 cents from the bill. This was the most insulting dining experience of my life.",

KTC was a solid 3 stars for our breakfast this morning. I ordered the Canjun Bene; Paul, the Belgian waffle; and Jason, the biscuits and gravy. Three orders of mini muffins arrived shortly thereafter, with real butter and apple butter that was at the table. As others have stated, the muffins were great. Our meals arrived in a timely manner and we all dug in. Paul polished off his waffle promptly while Jason and I slowly enjoyed our meals. I honestly have to say I wish I didn't eat so many muffins because I wasn't able to finish my eggs, which were wonderful. The creole seasoning added to the Hollandaise sauce added a terrific flavor and just a little heat.  The decor made me feel like I was back home in Northwest Ohio. That doesn't add the the appeal for me, but some enjoy those things.  While service during our meal was attentive (I drink a lot of water during a meal and their glasses were pretty small, but I was refilled several times). However, after our plates were cleared, we sat around for almost ten minutes before we could flag down our server for the bill. Which was when we also received our kisses. Hershey's Kisses. Cute, but I rarely eat candy. Still, cute.",

Kiss the Cook offers you the small town feel of your local breakfast cafe but with this country hospitality through the nick-knacks and woven baskets for sell. The menu offers the basics of any small town brunch style restaurant and for the quality, I'd say the price is unbeatable. One of their trademarks seems to be their small muffins, and I'll admit they are pretty darn good! Not the only thing I'd come here for by any means but defiantly never have a problem eating the ones they sit in front of me ;)  One thing to keep caution for is the wait. The parking lot is rather small and the restaurant is much smaller.. so even on a typical weekday for brunch you'll find yourself waiting 30 minutes or longer",

It was actually a good portion amount. My friend ordered an omelette and it was huge. The prices weren't bad either. I paid about $11 for my meal. The food quality was excellent and made fresh and warm off the grill. The only thing I didn't like was the service. Our waitress only came to our table once and I was running out of water very quickly. But overall good place!",

Sandwiches, which are served in bags can be accompanied by homemade soups, salads and desserts. Earlier in the day, we love the French toast.

The crowd gets more mixed as the day progresses, and often has a wait on weekends. I really can't stress enough how great Ms. Susan was. She even took a customer's food to warm It up because he was away from his table for a few minutes. The man never asked. She ran up to the cashier and told the staff my name and where I was from.

We get stuck in routines when it comes to restaurant so finding a new breakfast joint seemed like it would take forever. I binged and found Kiss the Cook. It is kind of a drive for us but I have been wanting to try something new.   The outside doesn't appear to be anything special but I was wrong. The inside of the place is just gorgeous. I love all the many different tables and chairs and even those fluffy little cat miniature figurines. The servers are pleasant and quick and I have no complaints so far.   The food is delicious! Great big helpings and it isn't greasy! My daughter and I almost always devour the scrumptious muffins but we try to refrain ourselves in order to save room for our food which is delicious.   Definitely worth a try. Great service, atmosphere, and above all a great breakfast!",

Super homey little restaurant with tons of nick nacks on the walls. Not in a corporate chain kind of way but in a grandma's house if your grandmother was a bit of a hoarder way. It was all very cute. Although the place was packed we only had to wait a few minutes for a table. The waitress was incredibly nice and efficient. Everything on the menu looked appetizing. I settled on the special of pork chops and eggs, the pork chop was really well seasoned. The coffee was even good. I find most restaurant coffee to be too weak but it was just about perfect. Also I should add that they gave us a basket of freshly baked mini muffins for an appetizer. Any place that does that is okay by me.",

The service was good. Had a ten minute wait to be seated at 11AM on a Sunday.  Our waiter kept our drinks refilled. Unfortunately their cups are so small that I required 4 refills, but I never felt neglected. Honestly the small cup thing scared me, that had real potential to screw up my meal if they weren't paying attention...but they were so it's all good.  I had a real generic breakfast of eggs, bacon, pancakes, and a side of toast. It was all very good. I paid the extra $1 for \"thick\" bacon, and that was totally worth it. My girl got cornbeef hash and eggs, and she thought it was very good.  Next time I probably will try the \"New Orleans Omelet\". Sounded good, but at a new place I usually go generic to test the water, and get fancy my 2nd go around.   Impressive breakfast, I probably would've kissed that cook.",

The menu consists of your usual breakfast combos, pancakes, omelets, waffles...the difference between this place and all the others, I felt was the service and the small details.  Upon sitting down and getting water, they gave us a basket of homemade mini muffins. It was a variety of three - blueberry, zucchini and bran or spice.   I was delightfully surprised at how delicious the cinnamon roll was. I wasn't sure if it was going to be too sweet like the ones you get at the mall. Nope, it was sweet enough and had just the right amount of cinnamon and sugar. I'd probably go back just for these alone!   For breakfast I ordered the French toast but substituted the eggs for home fries (so good), and bacon.

Coffee was nice, but came out in clear glasses and was very light.  Good taste, but I enjoy a more bold coffee (not as watered down).  I had eggs Benedict and it was standard...English muffin, ham, and poached egg with hollandaise sauce.  Standard, but standard is good.  Good flavor, fresh sauce and toasty bread.  Potatoes had a nice spice to them and burned on the edges...love that burned spice taste.  All in all, if you find yourself in Glendale, Kiss the Cook is a solid little place for breakfast.  I wanna try a pie!!",

It was awesome she brought out our homemade cinnamon roll first all warmed up.  It was very very good, especially the sauce!  The muffins ... I can't say enough about the mini muffins!  Super good ... make sure to order a dish that includes them!  The eggs Benedict had good taste with fresh sauce and the potatoes were crunchy in a good way.  My only complaint was the potatoes and the Benedict sauce were super salty.  With the ham, it just didn't need all the additional salt.  Very solid breakfast ... we'll definitely stop again to try a waffle next time we are in the area.",

I had lunch with my father at Kiss the Cook and loved the free mini muffins as a starter. For lunch, I ordered the Eggs Benedict. Straight forward and perfectly on point. Loved it. A great meal and very friendly staff.   I enjoyed the meal and staff so that I took my wife and daughter back the next day. For that meal, I got really crazy and this time ordered the special meatloaf Benedict. :) It too was very good but not as good as their standard egg Benedict. Muffins were still on point. My wife had a custom omelet and daughter the biscuits and gravy. Both really enjoyed their meal and also loved the muffins.  I had been to Kiss the Cook a few times as a child and do not remember it being so tasty. Glad my palette finally woke up.",

Arrived about 8ish with only 2 tables occupied, but when we left about an hour later the place was hopping with a older, much older crowd.  Seated right away, greeted and asked if we wanted coffee. I would have had a iced flavored but they were out that morning, so ice tea it was. The tea was perfect. Drinks arrived minutes later along with a basket of mini muffins.   Both ordered the 2 egg combo, mine over easy, hers scrambled with bacon.  It took about 10 minutes for our food to arrive. Picture perfect except for the puddle of \"butter\" on the top of my eggs. Bacon and Grandma potatoes both a mix of crispy and soft.  Drinks refilled.  The place has a homey vibe with everyone, even fellow customers happy and sociable.  Was my breakfast perfect, no, was it good...yes, above average. Prices competitive with chain breakfast joints.  I will return and next time try the eggs Benedict, the lady at the table next to me had it and it looked amazing.  Parking easy too. A enjoyable morning.",

The food was good.  Not amazing but really good.  The hot muffins were hot and our waitress even heated up our syrup so it didn't make my pancake cold.  Omelets looked amazing and my daughter had the yogurt parfait which also looked incredible.  My eggs and bacon were really good too.    The service however was what set this restaurant apart for me.  Our server Rachel was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable.  She got our whole order correct even with substitutions.  And did it all with a smile.  She made great recommendations and checked on our table many times.  She was friendly the whole time and We all really enjoyed her.  I guess she's also a cook here but my suggestion is to move her to front of house.  She's awesome!!!!    If we come back to Phoenix we will definitely back.",

And I really have no complaints. I tried to \"tweek\"  my order (i.e. avocado instead of mushrooms) and it didn't come out as requested, but it was a busy Sunday morning so I pushed my mushrooms to the side of the plate and kept it moving. The world didn't end and my food was still edible. My friend had the veggie omelet and corn beef hash. I tried his corn beef hash and it was pretty good. It was my first time ever having it so I have nothing to compare it to, but it worked for me. All in all, Kiss the Cook is a cute little breakfast/brunch spot with pretty good food and I will definitely give it another try.",

    "text": "We took an Uber to the Fiesta Bowl and our driver pointed out Kiss The Cook as the best breakfast spot in Glendale. Not that I was looking, but KTC had not even been on my restaurant radar. Now, I'll be the first to criticize the Yelp community for having 400+ reviews of 'hip' breakfast joints but it's pulling teeth to get info on certain businesses or restaurants off the beaten path (generating user-content Yelpers, c'mon!) but not being aware of KTC and it's 100+ reviews is entirely on me there, friends.   There was a short wait when we showed up from estate saleing on Saturday morning but the staff was friendly and had us in shortly. I had the New Orleans Omelette and Jenny had the special with the Maple Sausage. All the food was excellent, the service was excellent, and the prices were reasonable. Not a lot of bells and whistles (the mini muffins are a wonderful touch) but KTC is an elite down home breakfast restaurant.   I can't stress enough how much every other \"country kitchen\" type restaurant can learn from KTC. Understated and over-performing if how I'd describe KTC. It's not the place I'll take my trendy out of town DINK friends after a night at [insert popular Scottsdale club with 600+ Yelp reviews], but it'll definitely be an upgrade for my Cracker Barrel & Denny's dining parents when they come to town.",

    "text": "After passing this place countless Xs, curiosity finally got the best of me so we finally stopped in 2 give them a try. There were a couple other occupied tables being tended 2. It was mid~day so it probably gets an influx of business in spurts during other Xs.     W8ed a couple min8es 2 b seated by a friendly hostess who seemed 2 b busy helping the w8ress(es) serve up orders/refills. Woulda preferred seating ourselves if not 4 the w8 2 b seated sign, instead of feeling awkward by the stares of the elderly patrons there but got settled in2 a centrally loc8ed small table. No booths in case u wanted 2 know.     I guess I understand the draw of this place 4 those that want the old fashioned home~style feel but dining there felt like being @ a cross between a Brass Armadillo & an Elderly Care facility. Though I did like looking @ some of the antiques 4 sale there, just felt a bit strange ~ almost like they're trying 2 pull off the ol' Bobby McGee's concept w/ vintage items like victorian boots, tubs etc but geared toward the much older.     Even tho I wasn't personally impressed or as comfortable as I'd like, everything was ok/tolerable part of our experience till we Eventually got acknowledged by our w8ress who acted as tho we were graced by her presence, snapping what~dya~want @ us. I almost replied: 'a different server'... but bit my tongue 1dering if this was just part of the 'charm'.     I ordered the Vegetarian sandwich & my companion went w/ the Seafood Omelette w/ iced tea & tomato juice 4 our beverage as she briskly walked away huffing/puffing/snorting like a bull ready 2 impale a matador. The hostess came over shortly w/ our drinks & a 1derful basket of cute li'l assorted mini muffins which turned out 2 b the best part of our meal/experience here, esp the AWESOME zucchini 1s!     Tomato juice was just V~8 in a glass & the iced tea tasted soapy & bitter. Don't know if there was soap not rinsed out in the cup but if it was straight from the tea dispenser, it was far more than soapy 'residue' & the tea part I could even make out, tasted like liquified mold so EWWW we reluctantly drank water instead w8ing 2 notify the hostess as we didn't want others getting sick or 2 evoke more wrath from the server who was intent on giving every1 hell.      When our food was ready 2 b served, she stomped over & musta mistaken our pl8es 4 frisbees as they were nearly flung @ us, mine almost skid in2 my lap!! Didn't ask if we wanted/needed anything else & was done w/ us till slamming our damages slip down when she was obviously ready 4 us 2 pay/get rid of us. The prices here might have felt like a pretty good deal if more of what we ordered was decent. Perhaps it was a case of we spontaneously picked a bad day 2 go w/ an equally bad cook & w8ress or maybe they were a couple till that morning & the break~up was gonna make every1 else suffer!!     I don't know if our server was having the worst day of her life or what, but apparently any1 else who had the mis4tune of her w8ing on them was getting the same treatment, so I guess we weren't being targeted. I even overheard a guy @ her other table telling her 'I thought I did something 2 make u mad @ me'. I couldn't make out what else was said, but it was obvious the poor hostess/cashier was trying 2 divert any neg8ivity by joking it off as something else.     The Veg sandwich was good (not gr8 nor bad but slightly better than ok). His Seafood Omelette made him spit in2 his napkin st8ing it was overly salty (probably trying 2 cover up what he called 'unfresh ingredients & bad seafood'). Leaving most of his pl8, was never asked if everything was ok or if there was a prob cuz it was blatantly apparent that the snapping turtle who could only bark @ people really didn't give a F*ck except 2 make others b the outlet 4 her nastiness!! We always treat our servers nice & respectfully, making things easier 2 b cleared (which they never were) & whatever the case was w/ this 1, she either needed 2 leave the drama @ home or better yet stay home OR here's a concept: not work in any scenario that involves having 2 interact w/ customers/public in any facet...     Kiss the Cook? More like, kiss their (_y_) A$S & still get sh*t!  IF we ever Dared 2 give them another shot (highly unlikely after what we were subjected 2), we'd b certain that some1/ANY1 else w8ed on us. Actually, scratch that ~ we'd have 2 make sure she wasn't there, cuz I'm sure I'm not the only 1 who doesn't wanna jump every other min8 w/ her slamming/snappy mouth/throwing things while trying 2 eat... nor feel like WEARING what was ordered (which depending on what it is) might b better than actually eating it ~ YIKES!!",

    "text": "03/19/10  Kitschy, fun country-life decor.  There was about a 15-minute waiting time.  Lots of older citizens waiting, which made for interesting chit-chat amongst the women.  It's refreshing when a restaurant's setting allows people to feel comfortable enough to interact among strangers-- Mom and I encounter so many \"closed\" individuals on a daily basis at work, so this is a nice change of pace for us.  Staff here seem friendly and busy, but efficient.  At least, ours was.  One complaint: it's a bit cramped in here.  It would be nice to have a little privacy from other neighboring tables, especially when I spied a room in the back that had maybe four 4-tops, and only one was occupied.  Can't recall what Mom ordered, but I wasn't surprised that she didn't enjoy it-- the menu description definitely did not appeal to me.  Website does not list a menu, and all I can recall is that it was an omelet w/ a couple of fibrous veggies (snow peas and something else; it was a strange combo, of that I'm sure of.  Chestnuts, maybe?).  I went w/ a Belgian waffle, two eggs, and bacon.  Coffee was weak, but our server offered to brew a stronger pot.  Nice!  While we waited for our selections, she brought out some mini-muffins to enjoy, and that we did!  We both really liked the bran.  I also enjoyed the zucchini-- Mom thought she detected cinnamon (not a fave of hers), but I think it's the nutmeg she was referring to.  Then again, I may be mistaken...  Waffle was, well, a waffle.  No accompanying fruit compotes or coulis to liven things up.  I always bring my own 100% organic maple syrup, because while most restaurants say they offer maple syrup, it isn't 100% pure, but a blend of maple and corn syrups.  (If it smells like Mrs. Butterworth's, it isn't 100% maple.  Just sayin'.)  Eggs were cooked to over-medium, just that way I like 'em.  Bacon was very nice.  Cute saucer and dinner plates, lovely mini-muffins (we bought extra to-go!), good bacon, and efficient service make for a solid two stars.  I wouldn't mind giving KTC another try, if we're in the area.  Next time we'll try the pancakes and crepes!",

Also, they give you a basket of mini muffins for the table if you order certain items from the menu. The mini muffins are a nice touch and the bran flavor is best in my opinion. The corned beef hash was tasty, however it was a bit oily and greasy for my taste. Potatoes were really good as well. My one complaint was the portion sizes were a little small. Usually I have a hard time finishing everything on the plate, but here I ate everything and was still left feeling a little hungry. Overall, Kiss the Cook is worth the trip if you are in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "The hubby and I were going out for breakfast but we realized the place we wanted to tryout was closed, so we decided to stop here.  We got seated right away.  I have driven passed this place numerous amounts of times but once you walk in, it was definitely not what I expected.  This place was quite quaint.  I liked it.  Our server was really, really sweet.  My husband ordered their special French toast with orange something and cream cheese...it sounded really good.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy.  They brought us a muffin basket and those mini muffins were really tasty.  Our food comes out and my husband hates it.  He says it tasted like imitation orange flavoring.  Of course I had to try, to me it was really strong on the orange maybe too much zest....I don't know.  My food was real good.  I wanted my eggs over-medium...they were much more runny than I like.  The biscuits and gravy were decent, not Crackle Barrel but good.  So needless to say, I saw that face of disappointment on my husband and I knew that there was no way I would be able to enjoy the rest of my meal.  So I hurried and ate what I could, paid and drove his butt to McD.",

    "text": "We stopped here for lunch today on our way home from outlet shopping. My mom had heard about it and so we decided to try it. Obviously lots of regulars as they all seemed to be known by the waitresses. It several minutes before we even got water and when our waitress did bring water she was less than friendly. No greeting and no offer to ask if we had questions or to tell us about the specials. I ordered a BLT and the bread was barely toasted. It came with a bag of Lays potato chips. My mom had the chicken salad over fruit and the fruit was not very good. Also came with a muffin which turned out to be Mini muffin. We then ordered the dessert special which was an apple dumpling and recommended by the waitress. It was okay but a little burnt! Lots of clutter and junky stuff as part of decor. Needless to say we won't travel to Glendale again to eat there but the locals will likely keep the place in business!",

The basket of muffins was okay but dry. My wife's biscuit and gravy was bland and cold, potatoes had no seasoning. We wasted $30 and the only pleasant was the wheat toast and my son's pancakes. Even the bacon was soggy and it is hard to hate bacon. We will not return.",

    "text": "A \"home cooked\" meal. No frills, not much for spices but a  decent breakfast. Mom had the 3 egg omelet which was full of her 3 toppings, good portion. I had the country breakfast with scrambled eggs & cheese & added a side of crispy bacon. Both were good. Comes with biscuit & gravy & potatoes, though they forgot my potatoes (they were brought after I asked). B & G were nothing to get excited about, though we may be B & G snobs but there wasn't much flavor & they had a cafeteria style to them. Hubby ordered the \"hay stack\" & was hugely disappointed & underwhelmed. It is a layer of hash browns topped with choice of eggs, sausage links, more hash browns topped with country gravy & a sprinkle if cheese. We were expecting a generous portion of goodness & it was in a little crock dish :-( Thankfully our portions were generous so we shared eggs & potatoes & half my biscuit to fill him up. Server was extremely kind & attentive though a little slow overall outside. With the many choices the area has to offer, likely we won't return.",

    "text": "I'm trying exceptionally hard to be nice here.  Hence, the three stars rather than negative stars and I'll get into why they deserve three stars and not five stars.  What saves this place from negative stars or a one star.  They are a local breakfast brunch location that serves up something a bit different from your standard same 'ol same 'ol breakfast eateries or diners.  What sets KTC apart from the rest, is the home style feel - like a quilted cottage with frilly things about and hanging wicker baskets.  I feel like I'm intruding whenever I'm eating here - as if three bears were to waltz on in and it would be a Papa bear, mama bear, and a baby bear.  The baby bear being the winiest of the three, but I concur why after breaking his dang chair and eating all of his food - who wouldn't get mad?  I'd be Pi$$ed.  Anywho.  The muffin baskets?  Whaaaattt?  And they're absolutely delicious and to die for!  That deserves a star and a half right there.  The waitress staff are the golden girls and they know how to charm each and everyone one of them.  On their breaks, they crotchet more decorations for the rest of the place.  It's ongoing, and it never ends.  Service is great.  Seriously, a bit crammed - in fact, waaaay too crammed which leads me to why this place is getting the review of 3 stars. I started my first job in the fast food industry and moved myself up to working at local restaurant's and steak houses - bussing tables before serving.   If you have a popular location that is crammed, than you have to make up for it with efficient turn-around times on your tables.  Bussing tables.  It's not really hard.  It's not really that difficult.  And it's seriously.....did I say, not that hard?  So, KTC restaurant seriously....I'm not sure if they hire developmentally challenged kids from a local boys and girls club (I'm trying my hardest not to be insensive but I already ruined it with the Golden girls reference, so what the heck right?) anyway.....I've never in my wildest imagination, can make up the time it took for one busser guy (you only had one job pal....one job.  ONE JOB) and still manages to screw it up.) bussed one table outside - about a 4 top round table - about 6 drinking glassware, assorted plates about 6, a coffee mug, some food scraps, napkins, etc.  Nothing too crazy.  27 minutes.    TWENTY SEVEN FREAKING MINUTES.  Did he leave to crotchet with the other girls?  Was he busy elsewhere?  Did he transform into a fixed street lamp on the corner waiting for nothing?  Excuses.  Once you start bussing a table, bus it until it's done, get it ready and prepped for the waiting bazillion people for the love of god!  This guy, seriously, took one glass with both hands...moved it to a cocktail tray that could hold no more than 4 glasses that he set outside a plastic garbage dumpster with lid - than, proceeded to lurch himself towards the table for aaaaannnnnnoooooooootttttttttthhhhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrr glllllaaaassss ccccccuuuuuupppppp.  By the time you were done reading that part, he would have been only halfway reaching for that glass cup.  Yeah, no joking here folks.  My jaw dropped.  He had help from a Golden girl, but she couldn't do all the work for him.  My lovely wife informed me, \"maybe they just don't have bus tubs...\" I was like, \"yeah...buuuuutt\" and as she said that.....Another busser from inside came outside and he had a bus tub.  I was like, okay....so, they have just that one slow guy right?  Wrong.  Even bus tub busser was having a hard time helping out cleaning the table.  Seriously?  They would leave entirely and not return until later and take a glass off or two.  Inside, was probably ten minutes faster, but they left tables open with an hour and half wait - seriously?  What is Beavis and Butthead doing?  Why is there no sense of urgency to clear a freaking table - you're losing customers or their patience.   Okay, I'm fine......seriously, we finally got seated after my children had already grown older and we no longer needed any children's menus.  They were adults now.  Good, we could have that chat that I been meaning to talk to them about.  My girls WERE 4 and 6.  Were.    Seriously Kiss the Cook - you guys have something special going on.  The food is excellent and you guys do honor Entertainment book coupon, and have such nice staff.  You have a cozy place but your parking sucks.  (hint to those driving around in circles in the parking lot - go to the lot just west of you; you're going to have to leave the parking lot first and than go to the street and go back into the 50,000,000 sq ft empty lot that is mere feet from the actual restaurant) - walk a foot or two, it aint going to kill you peeps.)   But, clean off those tables and get things turned around quicker...seriously!  It could be sooo much better and I want it to be.  I'll be back again with a coach's whistle and stop watch  on my next visit.  Seriously, bussers only have ONE JOB.....ONE!!!!",

    "text": "Kiss the cook is one of those places where it seems like a 50/50 chance that you will either have a good experience or an OK one. Judging by the initial reviews you would think this place is the go to breakfast place.  That isn't the case.  Its OK.  Nothing special nothing great.  First off the service is lousy.  I have been told that you should always tip the most at breakfast.  Why?  There is something about going to a place and seeing empty tables that erks me when the hostess puts your name down and there is a wait.  Be it 5 minutes or 20 if there are empty tables sit the customer down.  I know that they try to evenly distribute customers to waitress for tips and what not but give me a break.  This place is not that big.  To be fair when we finally sat down our waitress was pretty nice.    After seating it took about ten minutes for the waitress to take our order.  I got the corn beef and hash and my fiance got the kiss the cook special.  The corn beef was good.  The portion size however was maybe a scoop full.  Kind of disappointing.  It came with two eggs and potatoes.  Again portion size not too great.  The food was good though I like the southwest seasoning that you can put on it.  My fiance got 2 eggs 2 pancakes and sausage.  Her pancakes were pretty thick and the eggs looked good.  It was perfect portion for her.  The food came with a mini muffin basket which was cool and apple butter.  The coffee looked a little watered down but overall tasted OK.  They didn't have splenda but sweet and low was fine.    Overall the experience was not much different then Denny's or village inn.  The food was OK nothing fancy.  This is either a place that you will absolutely love or just say ehh.  If your in the mood for a big breakfast don't come here.  If you want to leave filling just right this is the place.",

I was wrong.  It was a GREAT breakfast spot. Service was fast, polite, and the food was great. I got the make your own omelet with the potatoes and some coffee and tea. The coffee mugs are unique compared to any place I have ever been to, they are a clear glass mug. It was a bit different. Overall very very good. I just kind of relaxed and enjoyed my meal, no rush it was very good, and the portions were pretty hefty, you can never tell what your going to get at these smaller places. So I was pleasantly surprised. And my check was less then $15.00 so not to shabby for the portion sizes. And i almost forgot they give you this basket of these delicious little tiny muffins, these things are like biting into heaven. They were so good. Pretty sure they are complimentary.   This place has a real small town feel to it, you could tell allot of the people inside were regulars. Everybody seemed really friendly.   The only reason this place didn't get five stars, because the parking lot didn't really have a good parking set up to get in, I had to walk around the building across the porch which was kind of dirty and could use a coat of paint or protection, and I didn't see any handicap spots...if they were there the signs were not very visible. That and it could use a good thorough cleaning on the inside, lots of nick knacks and stuff up, they are all pretty dusty. Could use a good cleaning.   Over all thou, a real good experience I will be back for sure.",

They brushed it off like we didn't know what we were talking about.  I do not recommend this place at all. Everything was subpar.",

    "text": "This is possibly the most adorable looking restaurant in Glendale. You walk in to what looks like an antique shop with a grandma's dining room kind of look. They offer a large dog friendly patio and the Facebook page says to ask for the dog menu so I really wanted to love this place.   They started us off with fresh hot just baked mini muffins of two varieties one tasted like vanilla cake with chocolate chips the other was some sort of spiced muffin. They reminded me of box mixes.  My cajun chicken caesar salad arrives. The greens look fresh and crisp and the garlic parmesan breadstick looks like cheesy toast. I tasted the chicken and it taste very salty and over marinated like processed chicken from Costco. It might be the teriyaki flavor topped with too much salt. The taste of it made my stomach upset. The one thing I tried that was delicious was the crispy cheesy toast they gave me. They should feature that toast on the menu because it was unique and tasty. It was kind of like a crispy grilled cheese. I had to share it with my husband because there were some issues with his meal.  My husband had the breakfast special. It was missing the green onions and tomatoes that our waiter said would it would have. The eggs were fine but the pulled pork under the eggs lacked favors and the muffins underneath needed some toasting because they were very soggy. Lastly they forgot to fry the potatoes. It seemed like someone took a baked potato cut it up and just threw it in the oven. This made the potatoes very dry like chalk.  Sadly I have to kiss this place good bye!",

    "text": "Definitely worth the wait!  We just flew in from Atlanta so our bodies were ready for lunch but in AZ it's still breakfast time so thanks to Yelp we found this amazing place!  Do not let the outside appearance deter you...it's very quaintly decorated inside with an eclectic mix of antiques and baskets and mismatched furniture. We were thankful to be seated in the back corner at a cute antique round oak table where we could observe the happy customers being served by a very friendly, however, very busy staff since it was a Saturday morning.   Their signature mini muffins served to every table were bran, zucchini and pineapple today and they make their own apple butter to go along with the butter served in the muffin basket. We were each able to taste all the flavors as our basket held six muffins.   My husband ordered the breakfast special which was The Sonoran Pork Omelette with a chile verde sauce served with melted Monterey Jack cheese over the top. Since his initial craving was for Costa Vida this was a perfect brunch option and I had a hard time keeping my own fork off of his plate!  They literally whip their eggs to create the thickest fluffiest omelet we'd ever seen!  He also ordered a side of biscuits and gravy which were very good with a sprinkling of table pepper although I personally like more flavor in my gravy, the biscuits were amazing.   I ordered the Belgian waffle combo with blueberries which was served with the perfect over-medium eggs I requested and the most flavorful thick crisp bacon I think I've ever tasted. My only critique would be that for the cost of the berry option I would have thought there would be more than 20 small blueberries on my half of a waffle.   Sandy was a very friendly and attentive server and was assisted by an equally friendly nearby server when our water glasses were close to empty.   We would absolutely recommend this uniquely quaint restaurant if you ever find yourself anywhere near Glendale...about 15 minutes from the PHX airport.",

The food has been good enough for me to visit on more than one occasion but nothing I've ever been to crazy about.   On my visit today, I ordered the crab cake Benedict and my girlfriend ordered the biscuits and gravy. My food came out cold and I sent it back, wasn't apologized to or checked back up on. I was on the fence about this place already and that tipped it. You are a restaurant - one job. Make good food and if it isn't - make it right! You guys had a wonderful opportunity to have me come back again in the future, but when I told the cashier about my experience it gets even better!!  When I told her about my poor service she basically said sorry and cut me off to find our server to make sure we were charged properly for my girlfriends turkey sausage. She spent more time trying to make sure we were being charged for the sausage than our experience.   Biscuits and gravy were good though! I would recommend checking something else out - seems like quite a few yelpers agree.",

Why are brunch places always so busy?  The decor reminded me of Glendale's antique shops. They have a bunch of baskets hanging and other random items surrounded the restaurant. Its interesting decor.   Upon entering the restaurant, there was a strong burnt odor in the dining area.  I'm assuming their vents weren't working.   I had the Country Breakfast with 2 eggs, biscuits & gravy, and fried potatoes. The biscuits & gravy didn't taste fresh and homemade. Fried potatoes were basically scorched.  They were tasteless and hard.  It helped when you sprinkle with plenty of black peppers.  The staff was efficient and friendly.  I love a place still give out free warm muffins. I would return just to order the basket of muffins. It was absolutely delicious.",

There was coffee and water outside for those waiting to be seated. When we got inside it was a little crowded but the food was good. I ordered the Cook's breakfast (might be called something else... this was a couple days ago).  It came with pancakes, eggs, sausage, and the mini muffins. The mini muffins are my favorite part-like most people's, specifically the zucchini ones.  I will come back!",

My son got the cinnamon roll, I got the strawberry stuffed French toast, and my daughter had the banana pancakes. They cooked the bananas in the pancakes which was unexpected but was very tasty. The cinnamon roll was phenomenal, the stuffed French toast was great but was stuffed with cream cream and the strawberries were on the outside still good though.   The service was great, food was great, and it was a beautiful morning so we sat on the patio and it was overall a great experience.   The only downfall was the kitchen was backed up so it was quite a long wait for the food but at least the server kept us informed about he hold ups. Communication is key and it was worth the wait.",

Then the lady finally said \"what's your name and how many?\". After we gave her the info she never said anything else she just ignored us like we weren't standing there then asked the next person the same thing. I thought it was very rude to be honest and I wanted to leave but my boyfriend wanted to try the food also. The waitress was nice. The food took some time to come out. Muffins were nothing special. You don't get much food. I ordered the huevos rancheros and I took one bite and did not touch the rest. They had huge tomatoes in there with oinions and big pieces of bell peppers which I never seen on huevos rancheros. All I ate was the potatoes which tasted like bacon or sausage (This is a problem because I dont eat pork). We will not be returning.",

It came with a bakers basket, a small basket with 6mini homemade muffins. They were piping hot and delicious. My meal came with potatoes, eggs and biscuits and gravy. I added 2slices bacon for only 1.75. My husband had the Cajun omelette it had a spicy hollandaise sauce. He devoured the whole thing.   Everything tastes like it is made from scratch and very fresh. If you are in Glendale you need to check it out. They are open until 2:30 so plan accordingly.",

The place is very unique and full of antique decorations (which some are for sale). I went on a Monday late morning and the place was full! we had to wait a little to be seated. The food was good, the bacon was nice and crispy. The pancakes were soft and fluffy but a bit small compared to other breakfast places I've been too.(nothing bad) Deepening on what you choose, they give you small muffins, the muffins were delicious! However, I did find their coffee to be very light , it lack a robust taste. Over all this is a great place to have a good breakfast! The menu prices are very reasonable, and once again their decor is super cute.",

    "text": "Like Cracker Barrel except slower service and slower food prep time, and a paucity of seating.  The building is extremely long and narrow from the outside view, thereby leading to expectations of a roomy interior but then you get inside and feel tricked.  There's a small counter and cluttered waitstaff area that takes up a good chunk of the non-cooking area inside, and then what looks like a living room sized seating area is all that's left.  On a Monday morning I was barely able to get a table.  I can't imagine the weekends.  Food was above average, prices were fair, but I thought the portions were too small.  For $5 it's a very small stack of 3 pancakes, and you're not eating into the profit margin much by having them actually fit the entire surface of the plate.  My order was more like the side order that you get for free with an omelette purchase at IHOP, except that the pancakes were spread out on the plate instead of stacked up straight.  And the place does have that Cracker Barrel cute country feel to it, but the old part of Glendale isn't convenient for most of us, especially this portion that is immersed by used car dealers, pawn shops, and homeless pedestrians.",

I asked to be seated but the hostess was one of those anal types who could not multitask. She let 10 people gather before seating anyone.  After being seated I waited and waited. Three waitresses walked by but still no service. Got fed up and left. I think it is typical for a single woman to get less attention than when she is with a man. Should have brought Big Poppa, I guess.  Kiss the Cook has always had so-so service but the good food keeps me coming back.",

They had fresh squeezed orange juice on the menu but when we asked, we were told it was out of the box. I ordered a side of thick cut bacon which turned out to look like regular bacon. We were reassured that it was wider then the other bacon. I don't like this False advertising of menu items. The only saving grace was the mini muffins but I'm not sure if its worth a trip back.

It would have been LOVELY since it was nice and cool outside, but after we received our drinks (me, iced tea; the boy, freshly squeezed oj) and our basket o' mini muffins, it started to POUR.  The \"covering\" thing they have over the patio is more of a mesh to filter sunlight, as opposed to an actual solid covering type material. Our table starting to get super wet. We were sitting next to another couple who decided they were going to stick it out and finish their breakfast, but since the boy and I hadn't received our actual meals yet, we decided to check and see if we could sit inside.  They were happy to give us a table inside, and actually made a few jokes about how crazy we were to sit out there in the first place considering how cloudy/stormy it looked. We received our food shortly after being seated on the INSIDE of the restaurant. The boy got the farm special? country special? something like that, it came with pancakes, scrambled eggs, and sausage. I got whatever the other special was that was DELICIOUS potatoes, biscuits and gravy, bacon and scrambled eggs.  Our breakfast was wonderful. I loved how all the dishes and everything we mismatched, a very cute country look. Our server was fantastic. I'm sure we'll go back again. :)",

    "text": "Went there recently on a Saturday afternoon because of some research here on yelp.  I love breakfast food even though I have it about once a month.  I could not complain about my experience whatsoever, great food, great prices, good service, and a cozy atmosphere.  Definitely not the Denny's experience which I thought this place would be.  My only complaint is the location, I enjoy downtown Glendale, but this place is a little ways from it next to tattoo parlors and check cashing stores.  Wish it was downtown so I could enjoy the shops after a scrumptious meal.  Overall this place is worth a shot!",

    "text": "Based on fellow Yelpers we checked out KTC this morning... Not too bad - Cute inside, we were in the back room which was a little dark... muffin basket that reviewers have noted was just small bran muffins... not awesome, but ok.  The staff (esp Donna) was attentive and the food came out quickly.  Definitely better than Denny's...",

    "text": "We went to Kiss The Cook for first time two weeks ago. Even tho we had to wait it really was the 15 minutes we were told. The place was very crowded but server was friendly. Pretty good green chili omelette and Cajun eggs Benedict.  Went a second time last Sunday, this time the server was distracted, didn't bring the mini muffins until asked and coffee refills were non existent. We had the green chili omelette and special Burger Slider eggs Benedict which was English muffin -except not on mine, hamburger patties-the size of half dollars one undercooked  and one extremely overcooked, grilled onions-except not on mine, grilled tomato- one very thin slice for two eggs, eggs, sauce, and cheddar cheese-again except not on mine. The food came out 5 minutes apart with the Benedict first.  When we said something to the server about the missing parts of the Benedict her response was \"Oh, I'm sorry\".  That was it.  When we told the hostess/cashier about the poor food quality...same response \"Oh, I'm sorry\".  We tried to get someone from Kiss The Cook to acknowledge poor food, poor service and poor responsibility.  Never happened.  We eat breakfast out every weekend. We will not be returning to this place.",
