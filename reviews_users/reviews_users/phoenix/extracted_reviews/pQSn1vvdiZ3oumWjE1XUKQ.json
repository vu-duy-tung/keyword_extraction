    "text": "Love this Filipino run Thai restaurant.  We were with our dad who can't handle spicy food.  They were very accommodating and made sure our meal was enjoyed by everyone.  Pad Woon Sen - this was on the special board and I am always happy to see it.  This was filled with vegetables, chicken, and beef.  Perfectly cooked!  Pad See Ew - the wide noodles were well cooked with just enough sauce.  The beef was a perfect addition.  Spicy Eggplant - They made it not spicy and it was in a light black bean sauce with tons of vegetables (mainly peppers and onions).  We picked it with chicken that was just slightly dry.  I should have gone with pork or tofu.  Spicy Salmon - This was another special.  Deep fried salmon (no batter) that is quickly stir fried with vegetables in a sweet sauce (probably would have been perfect with some heat but we asked for 0 spicy)  Mango with sticky rice - perfect portion, wonderfully ripe mango and not too sweet rice.  Prices were VERY reasonable.  Our entire bill was less than $50.  Servers were attentive.  Food was tasty.  Portions were huge.  Definitely deserves repeat business!",

We've been having a hard time finding decent Asian food in Scottsdale so I'm happy this place isn't too far from our house. We ordered take out and they were very prompt and friendly. We ordered their spring rolls (3.5 stars-note: they do not have fried rolls), larb gai (4 stars), spicy noodles (aka, pad khee mao-3.5 stars) and their garlic beef (4 stars). Their prices were very reasonable. We'll definitely go back.",

    "text": "The ambiance was nice, typical Thai restaurant decor. The food was well priced and in excellent portion. I ordered the curry noodles which tasted really good, except that it was a bit dry and the seasoning didn't seem to have mixed well and it left me with a bad aftertaste, it felt like the dish was over salted but it wasn't. I still enjoyed it despite the fact, I just couldn't finish it.   My boyfriend ordered the pad won sen and that was also quite tasty. We were told that even at a 0 on the spicy meter, it was still a bit hot, so he ordered his dish at a 2. Even at a 2, the dish was very mild and not spicy at all.   Our two friends ordered the green curry with tofu and the pad se mao with tofu and they both said their dishes were excellent.   Overall, the food was excellent, the wait staff were very attentive and came by often to check on us and refill our water. 4 people, 4 dishes and 2 drinks, the tab came out to around $40. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "First, a bit of background about me and my wife. We don't like spicy food, so all our food was ordered with minimum spiciness (perhaps the term is \"American wuss\"?). If part of how you judge Thai food is based on spiciness, this review may not be applicable.  Second, we had been to Thai house a few times off-and-on over the years, the most recent time being about a year ago. We only came back here because our FAVORITE Thai restaurant - Thai Rama at 13th Ave and Camelback, finally closed down a while back and we just had to get a Thai fix.  OK, with all that out of the way, here's what we ordered and what we thought:  First, we ordered the Thai Won Ton. This was a delicious soup; the chicken dumplings were firm and tasty (not overcooked as is often the case), and the broth had a delicious hint of garlic. Plenty of vegetables. The only down side here was there were no pork strips. Still, quite good.  We ordered two main dishes and an order of fried rice. All were generous portions (we've been eating left-over Thai for three days!).   Pad Thai, the standard dish. Remember, we ordered it with minimum spiciness so it had NO bite at all. It was quite orange in appearance, a bit too much, I thought, which was a bit off-putting. But it was DELICIOUS! The sauce was sweet, the noodles firm, and lots of egg, veggies, etc.  The other main dish we ordered \"off the menu.\" My wife loves clear noodles, and the only clear noodle dish they had on the menu was a salad, served cool. We simply asked if they could make it up in a hot dish, and they quickly agreed to make Pad Woon Sen, which is a stir-fry based on clear noodles with lots of veggies. This is a light, tasty dish, and it was as good as our old stand-by, Thai Rama.  Both the Pad Woon Sen and the Pad Thai were served fresh and hot!  The fried rice was also delicious.  We were there relatively early on a Saturday evening. The place is small, with room for maybe 50 folks top, and during our visit there were probably only about three or four other parties present. Maybe that was the reason the service was so quick, attentive, and easy-going, but it truly was a delight.  BTW, their Thai Iced Tea is also great.  One downside - they do NOT have coconut ice cream for dessert.  But other than that, we were delighted and have found our new favorite Thai restaurant.  For the Thai Iced Tea, hot tea, large bowl of soup, two entrees, and fried rice, plus tip, it was $50. A bargain in my book.  I also liked that it has no television.   The ambiance is fine - nothing to write home about. Years ago, they had a fountain-wall, but it no longer operates and just takes place and is relatively unattractive (showing the hard water stains on the plexiglas).",

I've ordered take out from this location twice and both times I've been completely satisfied.  Tonight I called in the following order for four of us: -2 orders of summer rolls -1 order pad Thai with chicken and shrimp - medium spice -1 order pad seu eu with shrimp and extra broccoli - medium spice -1 order eggplant with  mixed veggies -extra rice  My brother picked it up fifteen minutes later and it was delicious!  Each dish was filled with flavor and just enough kick.  Everyone enjoyed the meal... not only was it affordable, but it traveled well.  Now if Thai House would only open another location in Old Town, or if they delivered, I'd be one happy camper!  But in the meantime, I highly recommend take out from Thai House.",

Except they are helpful when placing a order.  I must say the Yelp menu on the site has not been updated. So you will just have to sort that out when you're at the restaurant or place the pick-up order.  The Spring Rolls were great! The Green Curry was to die for and like most dishes, it has a little something special in it that brings out a wonderful taste in each bite you take. I can not explain it, but you just don't want to stop eating it. I have always ordered \"two star\" and found it to be not too hot, but flavorable. The Pad-thai is excellent and you may want to try the beef version, if you have not had it in the past.",

I started asking after 25 minutes and stood at the register after that. When it finally came out, it was not piping hot so I tend to think it was sitting back there somewhere. The place was a madhouse it was so busy. No apologies.",

The shrimp spring rolls were really refreshing and were the perfect appetizer for the hot day. We had duck curry, a special for the day; the dish was flavorful, with spice level toned down as we requested. The pad thai and the shrimp with asparagus were also tasty, though the seasonings came across to me as more Cantonese than Thai. The charbroiled chicken had a really good flavor, though the meat was a tad on the dry side. The restaurant itself has a very relaxed ambiance and comfortable seating, the service was friendly and fast, and  parking was ample.",

The only reason it's a 3star vs 4 because they only give small bowl of rice and the food is not always in-consistent.  Asian restaurant should always have unlimited white or brown rice unless you are ordering items from lunch menu.  The yellow curry and pad Thai is excellent.  My husband loves the fish dish.   Overall it's good local Thai restaurant.",

And they actually comply with your preferred spiciness level.   My favorite dish is the Kung Pao. I usually add tofu and shrimp but I've also tried it with salmon. So goooood!  The portions here are enormous enough that honestly I can have leftovers TWICE off of one meal. And at their reasonable, fair prices, that is amazing. My only complaint is that I NEVER have room to try their dessert!",

They gave a huge portion of the red curry, which was very fortunate because otherwise I would have had to go back the next day for more, it was so good.  The spicy noodles were excellent too.  The egg rolls were pretty standard and probably not worth all the grease.  I will say that if you want seriously spicy food, you will have to be very clear about that when ordering.  They asked me how spicy I wanted my food on a scale of 1-5.  The spicy noodles at a level 3 weren't spicy at all.  With the level 4 red curry I could taste some heat but it wasn't very intense.  So on that scale, I don't know if the 5 would satisfy True spice-o-holics but I bet if you say you want super hot they could make it happen.    I just have two gripes with this place: 1. They use evil styrofoam containers.  2. They are closed on Sundays.  Also I wouldn't recommend dining there.  Just order your stuff for pick up.  The place is pretty small and sparse and there were only two people in there when I picked up my order.",

Other customers around had been waiting for their food for over 30 minutes and one guy walked out.  People on their work lunch breaks were obviously stressed which sucks cuz youre on break from work to relax.  I ordered a coke to drink and it was flat. Returned it and then found out they were completely out of CO2.  Service was kind of chaotic and random, never felt like i was being taken care of without asking.

While I think they are pretty decent, I have been having serious issues getting the right spicy-nes. The first time I got them, I asked for level 3 spicy. Their spice meter goes from 0-5. I love love hot and spicy Thai food, however these noodles were practically inedible. Yet, they were so delicious at the same time I devoured the entire thing. And I felt like I was going to die later, as my stomach felt like a fishnet stocking... The second time I ordered them I asked for level 2 spicy. This time they were not spicy at all. At all!! They were so bland. I mean, they still tasted good, but were missing that drunken noodle kick! So, at this point I don't know what to do. Obviously every cook there must have a different idea of what each number means.  The last time I ordered from here, I simply said drunken noodles. I didn't specify a spicy level. I figured maybe this would give me the perfect in between spicy that I so desired! Well, when I got them, they were more bland than the level 2. And tasted kinda weird.  I will give them another try as they are right across the street from my work, and I hope we can work out our spicy issues!  4 stars for the service, they're really friendly here 2 stars for the food, until we can work out our issues And 4 stars for the convenience!",

Website menu pricing is spot on and updated. Started off with Satay and loved the peanut sauce and cucumber/onion side. Next Thai Wonton Soup for me (piping hot and overflowing with wontons and veggies) and Tom Yum Koong hot and sour soup for my husband which he loved. For entrees, I had the Chef's special of shrimp, broccoli and asparagus with brown rice (large portion; took 1/2 home) and my husband had Pad Kee Mao (spicy noodles) which he raved about.  We finished off with the seasonal fresh mango with sticky rice and I want more! Definitely will be making this a regular spot and since it's so close to home I'm sure we will be getting take out as well.  Only wish we had visited sooner...",

    "text": "It's my 100th review!!! yay!   Went here yesterday afternoon for linner it was originally supposed to be a late lunch but my timeliness plus my dinner date's class ending late past 3:30p and traffic on the 101 north coming from tempe made our 4p meeting switch to 5p. Found the place on the left side if going westbound on shea after scottsdale road.  It's always nice to see a good friend especially if you haven't seen them awhile, it makes for great conversation especially over soup, we ordered a bowl of tom yum koong. Now, in other places tom yum is made with lime amongst other things that make this hot and sour soup so fragrant and delicious but this version lacked the limes and in its place were tomatoes and onions. interesting combination. In the broth was plenty of lemongrass, and galangal root, oh, and I must commend them for the amount of shrimp in the bowl, there was plenty, i think between the two of us we both had at least 6 pieces of shrimp. yum!  Honestly what peeved me with this thai restaurant was their lack of lime! It's a simple ingredient necessary for either bringing down the heat of the spice or enhancing the flavor. Michelle my dinner date asked me what I would rate this establishment, and the lack of lime gives this place not a True 4 but like a 3.75. We ordered pad thai, and asked for cilantro as an accompaniment to the noodles to add more flavor, and a chicken green curry. BOTH came in large portions, the pad thai was okay not the best but not bad either, next time i'll try the Pad Se Ew. The green curry was delish, loved the curry and the taste of basil. We had plenty of leftovers and our servers were helpful and available. Overall it was a great dining experience. A must eat/try in the shea corridor.",

I played safe and ate the panang curry which I will say was good. The others had thai basil chicken, the red curry which were good too. The helpings are decent as well.  If it can be taken to mean complimentary, if i am dragged to eat thai food, i will eat here. I also liked the interiors and the fact the place didnt have the strong aroma of thai food when you step in. Could be difficult to find just passing by .",

The interior is nice, much nicer than their Pima location which happens to be near where I work and often eat lunch. I always get the Phad Thai which, even if you order spicy #5, isn't that spicy. Sala Thai has it right when it comes to the spice, but that is another review.   I recommend this place- whenever I am sick, I go and get their wonton soup- the broth is excellent!

The flavor was 'fine' ... wasn't the best orange chicken I have tasted, but I was very impressed with the all-white meat - no knuckles here folks!   I am used to a spicier Thai flavor, but I give them a 10 for their friendly customer service, a 10 for their smiles, and a 10 for kid friendliness.

We got the pad thai with tofu and the sweet and sour chicken and orange chicken. They only use white meat chicken and they use nothing but fresh vegetable's for all of their dishes.  There soup is also to die for, especially the Tom Kai Gai.  The portions are generous, the prices are reasonable, and with fast and efficient service you really can't go wrong here.  This is also an excellent place for take out, they always say 15 minutes, but it's ready in about 10 minutes.  And, if you go to their website they have a 10% off cupon that you can use.  Another cool thing is that you can specify how spicy you want your order, anywhere from 1-5 (5 being the spiciest), which is really a nice feature to customize your order.  Whoo, yay Thai House!  4.5/5",

The use various levels by number (1-5, spicy to really, really, really spicy) Now be advised it may be a little difficult to see because the entrance to the place is actually in a little strip mall and it doesn't face Shea Blvd...even though the sign on the building does. If your coming down Scottsdale Rd...once you turn onto Shea Blvd...u will have to make a left turn at the first light you see and then a quick right into the mini strip mall. The restaurant sits right across from an apt. complex and it will be worth the effort once you have located the establishment. Eat, Drink and be Merry my friends.",

So we were surprised and disappointed when we walked in today. The place was empty, unusual for a Saturday afternoon. There were food scraps on the floor all the way from the front door to the back. There was also a large uncleared table with no servers around. When we sat down, we realized the entire floor was filthy with a dull film left from a dirty mop. The toilet and urinal in the men's room were foul. The towel dispenser was broken so a heavy roll of stiff towels was left on the sink. Lots of unclean paws had been fumbling around with that towel roll for a while. Ugh. Again, the floor was gnarly, like the serving area but much worse. The grimy mop used over the past months has blackened the beige grout between the floor tiles and 3 or 4 inches up the walls. Speaking of walls, the mirrors on the dining room walls are smudged. And the empty water feature with the calcium-stained plexiglass panels hasn't worked for a couple years. It needs to be fixed, cleaned or removed. It's ugly and unappetizing.  If our order hadn't come sooner, we would have walked out. The food was good but we wondered if it was prepared in the same unsanitary conditions as the rest of the place. Not a pleasant thought.  We hope Thai House will clean up their act. We love their food but we won't return until they provide a cleaner restaurant with better management and a janitorial service. Yikes, even the toothpick dispenser was smudged and dirty.",

I left over half of it.  No sense bringing it home.   The second dish, orange chicken, was customized to omit the breadcrumbs.  They did a good job with the customization but this dish suffered from the same defect as the pork dish.  The chicken was overcooked.   The service was attentive and friendly but there is little that can overcome thin slices of overcooked meat.",

    "text": "Thai house has very good food and large portions at a solid price. The Satay is excellent and the peanut sauce that comes along with it truly enhances the flavor. The reason I give this place a three star is due to lackluster service. I came in with my family on a Friday night which was somewhat busy, I was seated immediately but my table wasn't served for nearly 40 min in which every other table including those who came much after us were served. We were not even asked about what drinks we wanted until we went to the front and asked twice. The wait for our food was very long and when we asked why, the waitress merely responded with \"no problem\" which I found confusing. I came in another time and I ordered the garlic pepper beef with a \"1\" on the spiciness scale (that's how you order most plates with a spice rating to accommodate your taste), a 1 should be not spicy at all but I ended up with a very spiced up plate which I could barely consume which really hurt my experience at the restaurant, when I asked the waitress about it, she chalked up the spiciness to the black pepper which didn't seem right to me. To sum it up Thai house is a good restaurant with insufficient service.",

    "text": "Our daughter is hardly ever home and since she's home we decided to go to Thai House. We got there early for dinner on a Monday night. Walking in and was greeted right away but the restaurant didn't really standout to me. Fair amount of tables and nice. Nothing special.   We started out with some Gyoza. It comes with six to an order and a dipping sauce. Tried it and they were ok. Crispy just how I like it but it just seem like it didn't have a lot of taste. Little bland in my opinion.  I ordered the spicy eggplant with pork and medium heat. Really liked it a lot. My meal came with a bowl of rice but had to order an extra bowl to soak up all that sauce. So good. It had nice big portions of eggplant with thinly sliced pork, onions, and peppers. Nice heat. A little too much heat for me but nothing that rice and water didn't help.   My wife and son ordered the Chow Mein with beef and chicken. They don't like heat at all so they were happy that it wasn't spicy. Didn't really hear a complaint from them and they gobbled their dishes up too.   My daughter wanted her favorite Drunken Noodles but they call it their Spicy Noodles. So she was happy. She got medium heat too and really loved it. Little too much heat for her too but she was able to finish it.   To top off our meal we ordered the mango sticky rice. Little different cause the sticky rice and the mango isn't on top of each other but it was just as good. No complaints here. Enjoyed it. Sweet rice with the fresh mango. Each bite was so good.   So the service was okay. They brought us our drinks right away but we had to keep on asking for refills about three or more times. The server really didn't keep tabs on us to make sure we didn't need anything.   So I would say that this place has really good food, service is ok. Decent and the atmosphere was ok. Nothing special. If you come here then your coming for the good Thai food and that's all. Just remember it all about the food here. Enjoy",

As often as I come here, I never had anyone complaining about their food before. Everyone I came here was pleased with quality of food they serve.  My ultimate favorite here is Mus-sa-mum. Always order with beef and spicy level 5. This curry is sweet, so the spicy level 5 is just perfect for someone like me, cannot handle too spicy food. I also love their Thai Fried Rice. Taste so much like Japanese fried rice (or fried rice in Japan).  I ordered something new today, spicy eggplant. Surprised with rich flavor, I think this dish is going to be my regular item.  Pad thai, pineapple curry, yum woon sen, satay... they are some of my favorites too.  Price is very reasonable, we had seven people at lunch today and ended up being only $65 before the tip. We couldn't even finish everything we ordered.  Food comes relatively quick, great place to eat lunch.  I may not check in on Yelp as often as I come here but I am a regular here and the one at the Pima road.",

We've had the Penang and the green curry so far, both Currys were unbelievably tasty. We also enjoyed the garlic pepper chicken with cilantro. Super good super garlicky!!!

However, their curry was pretty good and I'm glad that I got to try that out. Maybe I should have gotten the spicy fried rice instead of the Pad Thai but originally thought that might have been too much rice for me.

Yesterday I ordered a spice level of 4 and it may as well have been a 1. The food was still good, just not as great as it would of been, if it was hotter. The staff is nice. It's usually always busy in the evening. Great for take out! I ordered again from here a few days ago and the food was exceptional. If you're ordering for multiple people I would recommend asking them to label the boxes since they don't do that already. Food ordered using take out is rather quick.",

We decided to go there on a Sunday night. Sure, for many that would be considered an off night, but it was crowded nonetheless. It is a shame that in the whole restaurant, there appeared to be only one waiter. When we walked in, the looks on the faces of the patrons should have been our first tip-off that trouble lay ahead. People had their checks in their hands, or were desperately looking for someone in authority to serve them. Eventually, the lone waiter saw us and gestured to us (we think) to sit anywhere. We made our way over to a booth that had seen its better days, with a torn seat that needed replacement desperately. We sat and chatted, sat and chatted, etc., all-the-while watching the increasingly-despondent other guests.  It seemed that the several staff people we did see were entirely focused on the takeout business. How can you ignore the hungry faces, the frustrated faces, so desperately trying to get your attention. I thought there was going to be a mini-riot. Unfortunately for everyone else there, they had either finished their meals and were waiting to pay, or they had ordered and were awaiting their food, or they were somewhere in between. For us, we had not quite fully entered this culinary purgatory, so after experiencing what it must be like to have a cloak of invisibility for far too long, we left.  As I said, we enjoyed this restaurant in the past, so we might try it again. Sure, they may have had just one bad night. One very, very bad night. But you are only as good as your last service, so the next time around will have to be excellent to resurrect this place in our minds' eye.",

The waiter a young kid asked if what I wanted to drink, I simply replied water is fine. A brief look at the menu I knew what I wanted. I waited for the waiter to return but he sat down behind the register playing with his cellphone. Just then the other gentlemen looked at the waiter to take my order but took it upon himself to do so. My appetizer arrived it was fresh rolls with dipping sauce. Before I could ask for chili sauce the gentlemen retreated behind the counter where the other young man was sitting. I had interupted them to ask for the chili sauce but another patron arrived so they blew me off as a waitress was attempting to assist me. She brings another set of silverware and I told her I asked for chili sauce as she left laughing to grab what I requested. The Papaya Salad I ordered was decent but for the price and service I received for my first experience at this place was anything but pleasant. To make matters worse after reviewing my account they added their own tip. I would never recommend this place to anyone if this is how they treat their customers and take they hard earned money without the customers knowledge. See attached images.",

Let me tell you, the flavors in all the dishes 'were through the roof'. Everything we tried was amazing. I think the hotest dish was the Panang and it was really good (lvl 3 in hotness) and was bearable. Our other dishes where in the level 2 range and, for me, just the right amount of kick.  The Tom Yum soup had plenty of shrimp as well as the Panang which had loads of chicken. My Pad Thai had lots of pork. This place does not skimp on their protein. We followed our meal with Mango with sticky rice. That was a great dinner experience.",

Their food ranged from not that authentic (but super tasty) with their dumplings and spring rolls, to the extremely authentic kao soi that tasted just like the one I had in Thailand (maybe even better)... They did a good job of making the food spicy and everything we ordered was good. Their drunken noodles were tasty, smokey, spicy, and definitely an item to order again. We tried a beef dish that was very savory and good, but the best dish was the kao soi.... A delicate, yet rich coconut curry broth with chewy egg noodles.... It was crazy good.

From a level of 1-5, me and the kiddies got 3s and it wasn't spicy at all. Hard to explain but the food here  was a bit sweeter than savory. There is another number scale for those who love the heat. That's a 10-20 scale. Hubs being the hardcore spice fanatic got a 10 out of the 20 for his red curry. The gentleman who was helping us recommended going lower on the scale and adding spice if the heat didn't meet the expectations, which makes sense since once it's too spicy, there's no remedy.  Hubs didn't think 10 was spicy at all so the man brought out the fresh Thai pepper sauce. Wowzah. What a kick. Loved it! A bit too much for me and I used with caution but I can see how people who love spice would love this.",

We were surprised that when it was returned; it was the original soup we gave them (with less chicken cause minus what we took out when we first tried it) to which they must have put more seasoning in to curb the fishiness.    We wouldn't have had a problem with keeping the original soup had they put our bowls of soup back in but now we had less meat and mostly broth left since it was thrown away before the 'fixed' soup arrived by another server.  Also, we wouldn't have minded them not wasting the dish (but since they threw away the majority of our original dish); they should've added some chicken back into the soup and not been so 'cheap'.  Server asked if we wanted to order anything else and we politely said no since we didn't want to chance another poor food experience.  Server was sweet was the only consolation since we left hungry with less money since they also charge extra for rice.  Back to Malee's Thai Bistro we go!",

However the flavor is worth the work.  Duck Salad-A special off the board Tangy dressing and crisp salad. Good portion of well flavored duck  Spicy Eggplant-OMG good! This I have ordered with chicken and pork. Great Thai Basil flavor and they will gladly modify to suit your taste.",

It's not what I'd call Thai hot, but it was just fine. My wife ordered 55. Spicy Salmon                         $12.95         Deep fried salmon, then stir fried with curry paste,     chili, onions, bell pepper and basil leaves. It was delicious. I ordered 34. Green Curry                            $9.95         Tender meat in a blend of green curry curry paste,      mixed with coconut milk, bell pepper, carrots,      basil leaves and bamboo shoots. I had mine with chicken. As we often do, we split both dishes. I found the salmon spicier, though both dishes were enjoyable. My wife doesn't eat duck or I would have tried Curried duck, which isn't on the regular menu but was listed as available today. The portions were decent since we didn't order off the lunch menu. We've both had enough of lunch menu standard fare. This restaurant has three locations, and we've eaten at two of them.",

    "text": "Met a girlfriend there for lunch the other day.  Waited 5~10mins seated at table for my girlfriend to show up.  The whole time ignored by the waitresses.    Finally my girlfriend shows up, we order, our food arrives with no utensils on the table for us to eat with.  I had to practically shout down the waitress to bring us table settings.  All this would not have made me give this eatery a one star . . . the thing that really ticked me off was my girlfriend wanted to have shrimp in her dish.  Paid $2 extra on top of a $6.95 lunch special.  That's a 25% surcharge.  The dish comes and I look for the shrimp . . . THREE, that's right, THREE measly, little shrimps.    Those shrimps better have been organically raised and human fed for the price they charged.  I complained to the waitress.  Instead of taking the $2 off of our bill, she tells us she would take 5% off of the total bill which amounted to $0.60. Wow, that's a big deal . . . not.  Then she comes back and tells me that she can't do the % discount because the computer won't let her do that during lunch, only during dinner.  Really?!  What kind of B.S. is she feeding me??  Hint:  if you are working as a waitress, be honest and bend over backwards for your customers because they are the ones paying you, not the $2.50/hr. you get paid from the restaurant!  I was so mad over the whole incident that I actually did not tip my waitress and I usu. am a generous tipper.  Needless to say, Thai House has lost a couple of customers over $2.  Really, $2 for 3 shrimps.  Haven't they heard that times are bad and people want to feel like they are getting some value for their hard earned dollar?  And please, don't feed me some B.S. about the computer can only discount a bill during dinner!  TWO THUMBS DOWN!!",

I definitely need to branch out and try a red or yellow or any other color. However, I order their Pa-nang lunch special at least 2/month. Their spicy scale is 1-5. I've been ordering a 4 and for me, it's nothing to cry over but it's a great combination of creamy coconut and spice. I always ask to add their \"mixed vegetables\" and there's always a generous amount. For a lunch meal under $10 it's more then enough for me. Their staff are always very nice & service has always been pretty fast.",

However, when upon ordering you're asked how hot you want your curry (on a scale of 1 being the lowest and 5 being the hottest), it usually never comes out the way you except it.   Like I said, their curries are amazing. I've had the red, yellow, and green curries and they've never disappointed. Green is probably my favorite between them all.   They also have a vegetable house soup which is absolutely delicious, light, and flavorful. I would recommend it.  However, one time I ordered the curry noodles. The noodles were so overcooked that they pretty much congealed together and it was near impossible to pick them up, let alone distinguish noodle to noodle when it came to eating the \"paste\"  Also their service is somewhat snooty and rude, and doesn't pay much attention to you or your questions.",

This location is where I go for take-out since it's the closest to my home. I go to the other one to dine-in since it's usually during lunch when I'm working. This location's interior is a lot larger and nicer looking. The food at both are pretty consistent.  The pad thai with chicken and panang curry are my two favorites, I always have a hard time deciding which one I want. I find that the pad thai can be a little hit or miss. Sometimes it's a little on the burnt side or greasy side. The panang seems to always be the same. I also wish that the pad thai came with a wedge of lime. They also have a spicy level scale. I always go for 1 or 2 (not too spicy). The last time I got the pad thai with spicy level 2, it was way too spicy. I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to spiciness but even my boyfriend said it was really hot. You could tell just by looking at it that there were a ton of red flakes. I wish the spiciness level was also a little more consistent because that can make or break the meal.  The best time to go is for lunch because their lunch specials are really great and the portions are huge. It's a little more on the pricey side if you go any other time. However, this is one of the best options around where I live so I've never tried to go anywhere else. Take-out is always really quick. I live about 10 minutes away. I always call in my order right before I leave because by the time I get there it's always there waiting for me.",

    "text": "I live in Tucson but was in Scottsdale with my mom for a few days. I was craving Thai food and my mom agreed we'd check out Thai House for dinner, as it was just a few minutes down the street. I'm so glad we did!  The restaurant was small but felt roomier because of vaulted ceilings and cleverly placed mirrors. The decor and lighting was pleasant and not too bright (as some Thai restaurants I've been to have unpleasant fluorescent lighting).   We ordered 3 out of 5 spiciness level for Gang Ka-Ree and Pad Thai, both with chicken. OH MY WORD. SO delicious! The curry was the best I've had, and it's a dish I try at most of the Thai restaurants I go to. It was the perfect blend of spicy and sweet from the coconut milk. The Pad Thai was great too, but that usually is not hard since it's such a popular and \"Americanized\" dish.  My mom and I both ate way too much but it was worth it. We should have ordered one dish to share rather than two. Our hotel room didn't have a refrigerator, so unfortunately we couldn't bring our leftovers home. So sad...   We had to wait a bit for our bill because the restaurant was extremely busy by the time we finished our meal, but we weren't in a hurry so it was no big deal. Servers were friendly and kind.  Next time I'm in Scottsdale I will be visiting Thai House again--with an ice chest for leftovers if necessary!!!!",

The Panang curry was good, nothing to write home about, but fine. I wouldn't go back here unless I was in the area...

Great flavors and full of a good amount of meat and veggies.  It's a big container too, at $9.95 its a great value.  Our other favorite is the spicy noodles, spice level 3.  Again, lots of meat and veggies and fantastic flavors.  We think we've dialed in the level of spice we like, for us these levels give us nice heat without an overpowering \"my lips are on fire!\" burn.  Service is always prompt, ready in 15 mins or less from when we call, and the order is always packaged very well.  Two thumbs up for that alone!  To recap - great food, great prices, great service.",

I will explain the 3 stars  First off I ordered the green curry with chicken which included green beans, bell peppers, carrots and bamboo shoots...it was yellow curry and no bamboo shoots.   Second off I ordered a level 5 out of 1 thru 5. It was maybe a level 2/3 in my spice level opinion.   That was the 2 strikes for me. The food was still good but I requested some extra chili's to spice up my dish, they brought me a little table spoon then said they were out. The over all experience was good but a let down on the green curry, bamboo shoots and spice level. I will give it another try in the future but with a more thorough order.",

The orange chicken is hit or miss on a scale of great to amazing! There is no bad day for this place. Skip the Pad Thai noodles as they are not the highlight here. Instead, venture to try the spicy noodles (aka drunken noodles) because they are legitimately the model for what these should and can taste like. I haven't had their other specials and entrees because I just love Thai curries so much, but I am sure they will be amazing if they compare to the quality of flavor you get with the rest of the food.",

    "text": "Yessssss! Excellent food!  Dropped off my wife and daughter to my daughter-in-law's mother's house in Scottsdale for a baby shower, had about an hour to kill before I pick them up to take my wife to the airport. It's suppertime. I open my trusty Yelp mobile app, tap on More, Bookmarks, and peruse \"Distance from Me.\" Well, lookit here, \"Thai House\" is just seven minutes away. And my Yelp friend and fellow Elite, Richa S. says it's the bomb. I'm going.  And am I glad I went. The food was AWESOME. I ordered the pad see ew with beef (Holy cow!) and the Panang curry with chicken (Holy bird!). They ask you on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the hottest, how spicy you want it. I ordered the pad see ew on a level 2 and the curry with level 3.  Level 2 was about right for me for the pad see ew. It definitely had a burn, but did not make my nose run and allowed me to enjoy the dish. Level 2 would be less than the burn of Sriracha sauce. Level 3 for the Panang curry was a bit too mild for me. I forgot that the coconut milk tones things down. I could have used Level 4.  As stated in some of the reviews, this place does not skimp. There was a ton of meat in the curry. And based on my take home container, they give more than a quart for the serving. This makes for great left overs at home. The pad see ew is the same--a LOT for the money. Both were extremely delicious.  Each plate was around $10. Very reasonable.  I highly recommend this restaurant. I am very sorry that I live so far away from it.  5* = A top favorite. Mind-blowing good. I will definitely return and I will go out of my way to go here. Worth every dime of my money. 4* = Outstanding. Tucson-top-tier. Some elements not quite as good as it gets, but it still is worthy of my regular business. 3* = Good experience. I might do repeat business if it is convenient, the only option, the only one in its category, or on a whim, but would not be among the first thing to come to mind. Would definitely recommend you trying it to get your own take on it. 2* = Not so good. Would not recommend at all. Waste of money. 1* = How are they still in business? Stay away at all costs!",

It's quick, service is pretty decent, the food is good, and the prices are more than fair for what you get portion size.   I got the pad Thai and panang curry when I came on several occasions and it's good. It's executed to what I think properly and consistent. I like their egg drop soup and the crab rangoons are pretty good as well. I like the sauce that comes with the crab rangoons.   The location is close to work and I can get in and out quick. The place is small and isn't really for large groups. Lunch is usually pumped in there and busy. It's really weird standing and everyone seems to stare at you when you are waiting.   Overall great place for lunch. I wouldn't personally go for dinner unless I was alone. Lunch game do it. Great spot for quick lunch and good food.",

    "text": "YUM. My significant other and I usually get our Thai staples of yellow curry and pad see ew whenever we visit a new to us Thai joint. We got the yellow curry with tofu - sand onions and sub broccoli. My s.o. says that she could eat the yellow curry every day for the rest of her life. I am with her in it being a 5/5 dish. Plus, the base does not have fish sauce so that's a vegetarian win! The pad see ew was just right and I was very satisfied. No baby corns that I could add on, but that's minor. Large portions and attentive, friendly service.  Then space itself was large and spacious. We visited on a Friday night and it was moderately busy. We barely had a wait for our food to come out...I would estimate 10-15 minutes. I also got the Thai iced tea for $2. It was very sweet...but that's the nature of the drink I suppose. Dinner for two was $25, I would say that's a pretty good deal!  My belly is full and happy. We'll be back here soon!",

Even down to the rice, I can only describe the food at Thai House as perfectly cooked. The spice system is a little fuzzy--I would call 5 \"medium,\" 10 would be \"hot,\" and Thai Hot really starts at 15. The house Cabernet is quite good as well. Service is great, atmosphere is comfortable. Highly recommend Thai House.",

The green curry is really good. I don't think it's too sweet, and there's tons of vegetables in addition to protein. I loved the cook on the tofu. I did ask for medium heat and I felt that I was given mild. I have a high tolerance for spiciness so maybe that's why it didn't seem as hot to me. In the future, I'll definitely get 5/5 on the heat scale.  The peanut sauce is really thick, creamy, and sweet. I personally prefer peanut sauce to be a little spicier, but my husband went crazy for it. He couldn't get enough!  Overall, very nice. If I'm in the area, I will stop by again.",

Our neighborhood Thai restaurant is closed on Sundays so we were trying to find a nearby restaurant to substitute for our old standby.  My daughter volunteered to drive 25 minutes to Thai House and 25 minutes back because she said this was an awesome restaurant.  Since she was driving, I didn't argue.  She brought back just two dishes, Pad Thai noodles and a red curry over rice dish.  I have had similar dishes over the years, but this was selection was AWESOME.  The portions were generous, the prices were reasonable, and flavors were perfect.  I am hooked.  The problem is that I live 25 minutes away.  I might have to call a realtor to see if I can somehow move within walking distance of Thai House.  We are definitely ordering from here again.",

The sauces for both were light and just the right amount of sweetness. They showed up quickly as well and  the perfect temp.  The entrees: sweet and sour chicken, drunken noodles, pad Thai, rand nar and chow mien. The portion size was perfect yet still on the slightly larger side. The waitstaff were courteous and quick with refills and to take used plates.  The restaurant is clean and quiet.

Located in a stripe mall, when you walk in it's very stuffy unless you sit more toward the back where the air circulates much better. When you see the Host sitting by the cash register machine fanning himself with a menu, you know I'm not exaggerating. The restaurant looks old, a bit dingy, need a fresh coat of paint, a good cleaning plus clean the curtains, fill the empty glassed in area with water or plants.  We ordered 2 large ice cold Singha served with ice cold mugs (love). We ordered the Fried Egg Rolls, a cup of Tom Ka Gai and a Chicken Pad Thai. There were 4 egg rolls fried perfectly, but the sauce kills it, try serving with the authentic Sweet Chili Sauce, the filling was just unseasoned shredded cabbage (nothing special). The Chicken Pad Thai (that we ordered off the main menu was mostly noodles, very little chicken, egg, scallions or beansprouts. Plus it tasted very sweet. The best part of the lunch was the Tom Kai Gai, fantastic filled with chicken, the broth was fantastic velvety, perfectly seasoned.  Its hard to find a few good Thai restaurant around the Scottsdale area, so I will pass on Thai house and keep looking.  Atmosphere: Old and a bit dingy, Service: very good, Food: very OK",

We were seated (no one else there) and looked at their menu.  We ordered from their lunch specials; I got their pad thai with tofu instead of chicken, and my brother got the beef and broccoli. They come with your choice of fried or steamed rice (both chose fried) and soup or salad (he got soup, I chose salad). Few minutes later, we both received bowls of soup. Not what I asked for, but it was fine. Tasted good too. Another pair came into the restaurant after us and they received their food before us, not cool. They both had steamed rice so maybe our fried rice had to be cooked? My pad thai (level 4/5) was on the sweeter side, which I don't care for, and the heat was minimal. The portions were pretty good, I had leftovers which tasted fine. The broccoli in the beef and broccoli dish tasted burnt, so that was eh. Overall, it was a great deal but I would go elsewhere for Thai food.",

I'm not a huge fan of Thai food and I've had limited ordering experience so I went with the orange chicken lunch special. For the price you get a large amount of food. The orange chicken itself was pretty standard as I have had similar dishes. It did the job but wasn't memorable. Others in my group had the panang chicken lunch special and some other items. They all thought the food was pretty decent, although those who ordered a level 5 spicy thought it wasn't nearly spicy enough.   The service was pretty blah. It was fast enough but a few items were missing and the one guy seemed almost inconvenienced that he had to take our order. Could have been much worse though.

    "text": "Craved thai food in Arizona, and I chose this one. Simply named, but it seems to have a lot of fans. The restaurant was very busy on the day we went, so we had high hopes that it'd be bomb.    Highly recommend the panang curry! Very creamy and flavorful. We ordered it at the highest spice level and it was so good we reheated it and ate it again the same night. Comes with small bowl of rice.  I was slightly disappointed with the pad thai since I thought it was really sweet. Definitely sweeter than most. It wasn't bad, but I definitely mooched off my boyfriend's curry more.   The menu items are huge and meant to be shared family style, so we ended up with a lot of leftovers. Decently priced and good service. The wait time for the food can be a little long, but overall our experience was decent!",

I hated the food and couldn't eat it. Basically threw everything away including my money. The receipt shows that I ordered the correct food but the food was wrong.  I only ordered from there because Thai Coconut across the street was closed. Their food is absolutely AMAZING and authentic. I highly recommend trying Thai Coconut for really incredible Thai food and wonderful, caring customer service.",

We did this for our drinks, for our order, for extra napkins, and for our check. Why do they even have people working there serving if they don't know how to serve. We ordered the spring rolls, which were fresh and pretty good. Their dipping sauce was a sweet syrup style instead of the creamy peanut butter style and wasn't my favorite. I ordered the Larb and it was not good. It literally tasted spoiled with a sweet flavor and I barely ate it. My mom got the panang curry, which was edible but not anything close to panang that I've had at other places. Everything is not cooked fresh. They had our food out in 7 minutes... which I hate. I like my food cooked fresh... especially Larb! All in all would not be back, and I do not recommend! (Side note- if the service is so lazy to wait on people then I'm sure the cleanliness is also lacking)",

My last visit there a week ago showed the food has really declined and staff doesn't care. Chicken satay was overcooked and the tom yum soup was missing a few ingredients.   Everything was just off.  I called to tell them the issues and to see if there's a new cook or something specific.  The person answering the phone said \"no, but thank you for letting us know.\"   They clearly didn't care about making anything right.   The food is quite pricey, which i'm willing to pay for good food, but I won't be back.  However, the other Thai House on FLW and 101 is consistently great - it seems to be run independently.   I live half-way between the two, so i'll keep going there, instead.",

I  have visited Thai House, Scottsdale, Pima and 101 location along with my family for a weekend lunch and we had a very pleasant experience.   Thenafter, learnt that Thai House has a branch on Shea so we stopped by for grabbing some Thai Tea on one hot afternoon.  I am aware that Thai Tea is priced at $2.00 and with taxes totals to $2.16. But at this location, the cashier initially asked for $2.16 and then charged us $2.70. The difference in the two amounts is minimal, but was over charged for no reason? Had we dined, our bill could be easily manipulated with an amount of their choice?  I need an explanation on what basis the $0.54 was charged extra and no receipt was given on the transaction?

The restaurant is located in a little shopping center and is a medium sized restaurant.  I ordered the Tom Yum (as usual) and some curry with green beans, carrots, and potatoes.  I was pleasantly surprised at the perfect \"sneaky spicy\" of all of it.  The curry dish was humongous, and after dining in, I will have at least four more meals out of it.  The Tom Yum cup of soup was also a very large cup and was more like a bowl. The prices were normal for this type of food.  We went on a Saturday evening, rather early, and the service was excellent.   My friend ordered the green curry with seafood. She raved about her food and enjoyed the brown rice option.   The service was an issue this past evening when my friend and I were craving Thai food. The wait staff saw us, and 20 minutes passed without one waitress asking us what we'd like to order.  They were rather busy, but we stayed for the 20 minutes and we were completely ignored!  The table of people who had come in at the same time were giving their orders a few minutes after they arrived. I don't know why we wasted so much time, but we left after we were again ignored by the wait staff.",

Service is always good, and the food comes out pretty fast.  Very authentic.  I think the price is pretty good for what you get, quality and excellent ingredients.  Thai Tea, and the Hot teas are great!",

Their thai iced tea wasn't watered down one bit and wasn't overloaded with ice either. Nothing is skimpy about this place. We had tons of leftovers left. I will make this a definite stop when in the area!",

We decided to start with the Tom Yum soup- a bowl.  Not a huge bowl for 10.95 in my opinion but did not lack in flavor it was delicious and we ate it to the last drop.  My dad got the special curried duck - this was in a red curry sauce and had great flavor.  The duck was cooked perfectly.  The only thing lacking was vegetables.  It just had red bell peppers and pineapple (not a lot).  I had the Spicy noodles with chicken.  I am not complaining but there was more chicken than noodles and this too was lacking vegetables - I had bell peppers and thats it.    I have had these dishes in Thailand and else where and everything is always loaded with veggies and thats what I love.  They nailed the flavor and have a great menu just wish it had a little more to it.  Service 10  Atmosphere 10  Food 9  Beer 10 - they have Singha and Chang beer here - great Thai beers!",

After being spoiled by Thai food after visiting Thailand, my taste buds may be spoiled, but this was far from a 4 star rating.  I chose the chicken Pad Thai on the lunch menu which came with soup and rice (I chose the fried rice).  The soup was an egg drop soup that had an abundance of egg drop, but no flavor at all.  With some coaxing from some soy sauce and hot sauce, the soup was edible, but I would never order it off the menu.  The Pad Thai and rice came on the same plate.  The chicken was dry, and the noodles flavoring was mainly hot spices, with raw chopped scallions mixed within.  The amount of food was abundant, the service was quick and attentive, but the food lacked taste.  The people on each side of me ordered the chicken panang, which they said was excellent, but I'm evaluating this on the Pad Thai",

It was quite good, and had some decent amount of heat. Only complaint is the use of tail on shrimp. I hate having to remove them myself before I eat them. I wish all places would just remove those suckers before cooking. But that's really all. Service was excellent and it was decently priced, maybe slightly high but it was still a good value.

I had read her review the day prior to coming, so I recall her photo of what appeared to be a peanut curry.  It's a name I am not familiar with: Mus-sa-mum... but its a taste I will crave until my descent into frontal lobe dementia is but a forgotten memory.  It was a delicious peanut curry sauce, with strips of beef and chunks of white potato.  Some sauteed button mushrooms would have been divine, but I'll keep that recipe in my pocket for now.  I think I'll call my version: Mush-sa-rum.  I already have a twinsie, so I opted for their green curry over an \"I'll take that as well\".  It was every bit as delicious as my first green curry, so dont worry, Murray.  All arrived at the table with a large bowl of sticky rice.  After spooning both curries over my starch, my chop stick skills impressed my hiking partner so much, that she commented \"Why dont you just use a fork\"  I would love to come back and try a noodle dish, or a Tom Kha, or some egg rolls.  The food was wonderful, portion sized generous, and the kids working didnt hassle us for hanging around and carrying on for an hour or so",

When we arrived, the young man behind the desk was busy on his phone and ignored us until we cleared our throats a time or two. He did not look really excited to be interrupted. We were seated close to the kitchen. We waited for about 5 minutes or so for a menu (which looked much different from the online menu by the way). As we sat and waited, we could hear the kitchen staff in the back bellowing out the words to Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody. The atmosphere was rowdy in the kitchen, but SLOW in the dining room.  (very few diners) We decided we would not stay and be subjected to the noise and rudeness.   We go out to eat to enjoy ourselves and that certainly was not the case here.  A big thumbs down on this Saturday night Thai-Awful experience.",

Fresh spring roll- something I order at almost every Thai Restaurant.  Would have to say that these were not the best.  I'm guessing these were made earlier in the day.  Basil was browning and shrimp didn't seem super fresh. Neither of us cared for the dipping sauce.  The vinegar base was overpowering.  We asked for peanut sauce instead, that was better but also not great.    I ordered mixed veggies with Tofu, fried rice and egg drop soup.  No complaints here. Mine was hot and tasty.  My daughter ordered Chicken Pad Thai, steamed rice and salad.  She said it was good!    Portions were very generous.  Both of had plenty left to take home   Service was very attentive and quick  Overall a good dining experience.. can't beat the price!  Might not order fresh spring rolls again but will be back",

The vegetable dishes are great, and the spicy catfish is awesome (it's a 'special' but seems to be on the board all the time).  The larb gai (chicken salaid) is good too,though they serve too much chicken in my opinion on a small plate (you need to get at the lemon juice at the bottom, which is hard with a small plate piled high).    The big disappointment so far is the curries. They have about 6 curries, and each one comes with a choice of meat (or prawn/tofu). Now, if you've had authentic Thai curries like Massaman, it will come with tender cubes of beef, which are soaked through with the flavor and fall apart with the fork. But here, because they offer 'mix and match' \"Meats\", they simply dump in the pre-cooked meat and cook for a few minutes. My beef curry therefore consisted of thin slices/pieces of beef, which completely misses the point of the curry. I recommend they stop offering every curry in every combination, and get some real cubes of beef in there!   But the place does good overall and sells beer (unlike their place at Pima/Frank Lloyd Wright), so I'll give them 4 stars!  Their 'Chang' beer is better in my opinion that Singha, which gives me a headache!",

    "text": "Thai House is one of those restaurants that isn't afraid to flavor and spice the food the way it should be which immediately gives it two thumbs up. The fresh spring rolls had alot of flavor and probably the best I have had in a long time. The fried egg rolls were good but not great like the spring rolls. I sampled three entrees -- shrimp pad thai, beef kee mow and chicken pad see ew. The pad thai was perfectly cooked and prepared with a very fresh and flavorful taste but to my taste it was a little lacking in tamarind. The kee mow didn't shy away from taste or flavor with tender beef, al dente noodles and a nice kick to warm up the mouth. The pad see ew was nearly the best I have ever had with a huge amount of flavor and a kick not often seen at most restaurants. The wide noodles were perfectly cooked, vegetables were firm, and the meet was nicely tender and flavorful. It was hard to stop eating it was so good.   If I were rating on food along Thai House would get 5 stars. However, the service was a bit lacking with less than attentive server and the server wanted to charge us extra for a little (I mean about two teaspoons) peanut sauce to go. The restaurant is very clean, well lit and comfortable but the waterfall was pretty but on the loud side and had the faint smell of chlorine which is a bit of a turn off.   Even with these deficiencies I will add Thai House to my favorites list if only for the awesome Thai food.",

    "text": "I eat here at least once every week since it's close to my office, and they are always quick, tasty and reasonably priced.   I usually get one of the lunch specials (even the Chinese-sounding dishes have a Thai flair, especially if you order them with extra spice), but if you're hungry the house special chicken is well worth the extra buck, as are the Thai noodle dishes (the pad see ew is my favorite).    The wait staff is always friendly, the food is always quick, good and reasonably priced.  i haven't had a bad experience in several dozen visits, and i'll continue to call myself a regular.",

The portion sizes are extremely generous, and the prices are very reasonable - especially given how much food you get.  (My pad see ew was $8.95 and I will easily get two meals out of it)  The orange chicken was the best I've ever had.  I cannot wait to go back here again!",

The staff is Thai (at least some of it) and happy to accommodate, so feel free to order off the menu, as I do. My only qualm - and this is a purely personal opinion - is that that there is something not quite Feng Shui enough about the layout of the place and the decor to form a perfect harmony with the great Thai food. So I generally pick up.",

The prices are very reasonable and the staff is efficient for the most part.  The temperature has been a little chilly both times we were there and it is also slightly loud.   All in all, I'm a fan!",

We just discovered this place in August and have eaten here at least three times.  Reasonably priced and absolutely delicious.  The curry dishes, the noodles, all wonderful!  Each time we've been we've gotten recommendations from the staff and have not been disappointed once.  This place may look a little vacant when you show up but we learned on our first visit that they do a lot of take out business.  If you like Thai, this place is worth a visit!",

    "text": "while i miss sabudy's that used to be in this spot, i'm very happy that i can still find food i love in this location! so as for food, i give 5 stars.  but they put a fountain inside, and its so loud for this tiny space.  there's nothing to absorb the sound so trying to have a conversation is almost impossible.  take out is an option and i've done both eat in and take out, and there is no loss of quality by taking it home. by far the best dish there is the pineapple fried rice.  it is absolutely delicious!!  while we usually have some to take home of our other dishes, this goes rather quickly.  you get a nice crunch from the cashews and sweetness from the pineapple.  we get a bit spicy so you get that too.  just really nice flavors. we've also tried the rice noodle soup, which is good but we got served with a ridiculously tiny serving spoon.  we also asked for the shrimp on the side (i don't eat it, but everyone else in my party did) and they only brought out 4.  the ginger delight with chicken is also very tasty.  the yellow curry is really good and nice on a \"cold\" arizona winter evening. the massamun curry is also very good. lastly, i had a bit of their thai iced tea.  it was nice, not too sweet but lots of good flavor. i'm a big fan of thai food, and this is one place that i keep going back to.",
