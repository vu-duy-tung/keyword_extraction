It's not a sit down restaurant, so don't expect that, it's tacos and burritos with pickled red onions, house roasted corn treks and Chipotle cream. It's really good, trust me.",

I'm also a fan of all off their marinated chicken mmm mmm! If you are looking for an authentic taco shop, this is your spot. They offer you samples if you're unsure of what to order and they have lots of homemade spicy salsas. So happy they are in the neighborhood!",

Many thanks to the staff at Sombrero's for making some extremely flavorful Mexican food complete with friendly service.    This was my first time at Sombrero's and I had a shrimp burrito and really enjoyed it.  The rice, chopped onions, cilantro, chipotle sauce, roasted corn and hot salsa made it a highly enjoyable lunch outing.  I also had the super nachos with carne asada.  Delicioso!!!  Sombrero's is a casual spot with 2 large TVs, to satisfy a sports fan's cravings on a weekend.  The high quality ingredients, variety of different meats and salsa bar make it an extremely worthy Mexican spot that can become a regular hangout for anyone that wants to try a variety of offerings.  I know I will be back and I will bring family and friends too.  **Tip 1**  Load up with not only salsa, but those pickled jalapenos and carrots at the salsa bar  **Tip 2**  They don't serve beer, so if you need to wash down your tasty Mexican comida with some beer, order the food to go....or have a few beers next door at Boulders on Broadway and then head over to Sombrero's!",

I wanted to try the green chili beef and only gave me a 1/4 cup serving of it since she had to measure it with a spoon. I'm reading all these awesome reviews about a huge burrito and I felt like I just got scammed. The worst was their tortilla. It tasted like rubber and not fresh.

The reason for the 1 star is not because of the food because it actually tasted good the bad review is on how dirty this place is. If I were an inspector I would have shut the place down. Especially if the front, where your guest eat is that dirty i can't even imagine the back.  The tables were all dirty, the floor was dirty, the counter where they have the salsas was dirty and most of the salsas were all gone and were sitting out there for a long time because the trays were crusted with how dried out the little bit of salsa was. The woman working came and open the little fridge at the bottom and just poured the salsa over it didn't even change out the trays. The little fridge was super dirty. The grill was dirty and they just kept adding more food without really cleaning it from the previous persons food. The area where they keep all the meats and produce was super dirty and when things would fall from one tray to the other it was cleaned up. The restrooms were disgusting and smelled. I would have enjoyed my food if it wasn't to how dirty this place was. They had 4 people working on the grill and not one could come and clean up the tables and floor. They also looked so disorganized and I think it had to do with everyone being in the grill and not really having a specific job. I wish I could say i would give this place another try but unless it is cleaner than this visit, I won't be back.",

As we arrived, we opened the door and immediately saw the line. My party of three were the last ones to fit inside the restaurant and it wasn't even noon yet. The wait in line did take a bit so I could see where this place would not work for somebody a time restrained lunch hour.  At first I was reminded of the Seinfeld episode with the soup natzi but after hearing a few people ahead of us, the staff was accommodating to special requests.  I decided on the carnitas in red sauce for my Bandero Burrito. It was an excellent choice. The meat was flavorful but not overly spicy.  The sauces smothering the burrito were the best I have ever had at a 'fast food\" type of place.  My wife and daughter both had the street tacos and were totally satisfied. It was nice that they give you a choice here of what toppings you wanted after the meat.  While the main food was exllent, the stars of the meal were the horchata and churros.  Too many places use the powdered mix that leaves a chalky taste but this was the real deal.  I told my daughter I will be disappointed in her if I do not get an \"in your face showoff\" picture during the school year that she got the eat there without me.",

The open burrito with barbacoa is my jam. While I like Chipotle as much as the next person and appreciate their ethical/fresh choices, the open burrito from Sombrero's is MEXICAN food. One day I'll try other things (they let you sample the different meats), but my love for the barbacoa open burrito runs deep and it's hard to stray. My companion is a fan of the green chili beef, which is REALLY spicy--too spicy for me, but he's into that sort of thing.  Both of the extra hot salsas at the salsa bar (there's a green and a yellow one) are spicy and flavorful. They're not unbearably spicy, but they'll make you sweat for sure. I thought I only liked tomato-based salsas until I had these. I ignore the others (in part because I always get take-out and the more watery salsas don't travel well).  The horchata really does taste like melted ice cream. Get it.  I've probably been to Sombrero's a couple dozen times but have been too busy stuffing my face with delicious Mexican food to write this review until now. Thanks, Yelp, for helping me find my new favorite neighborhood spot.",

You can barely see the sign for Sombrero's from the street - probably why I've passed it a million times and never really noticed it. Luckily for me it came up on Yelp when I was looking to satisfy my craving for Mexican!  I stopped in around dinnertime. It wasn't very busy so I was able to just walk right up to the counter. The women working were very friendly and more than willing to walking through the different meat options.  I got a burrito bowl with carnitas. Like Chipotle, they let you choose what you want in your bowl. I was a little worried t first because the carnitas looked like they might be spicy (they were in a red sauce). But actually they were not hot, just very flavorful. The meat was really tasty, the other ingredients tasted fresh and the bowl came with a small side of chips which were perfect for scooping up my bowl ingredients. I can see why their nachos are so popular. Something about their chips make them great with toppings.  This place is the real deal. Good portions and good prices. Plus they have awesome murals on the wall. I only wish they hadn't run out of churros! Oh well, there's always next time!",

It's in the middle of a strip mall and has a very small sign that says \"Taqueria\" rather than \"Mexican Grill\". Thankfully, I ended up in the right place, because I love the food. I walked in and found the place to be rather crowded. It's a small place with only a few tables. If they keep making food this good, they're going to have to figure out something for a bigger space, in my opinion. But of course, the disco ball is an essential element!  There are a number of options: burritos, street tacos, open burritos, tostadas, etc. Once you pick generally what you're ordering, you pick the ingredients that will go on top of or inside whatever you're ordering. I've had the open burrito both times I've gone, and I've been really happy with the results.  The red chili chicken and chicken tinga are both tasty. They have them pre-prepared when you arrive, but they heat them up on the skillet. You can choose rice, beans, cheese, sauce, and a variety of toppings like cilantro, pico, etc. The guacamole is pretty solid, although I never like how expensive guacamole is priced as a side at restaurants (side complaint). And as far as the tortilla options go, you can choose a bunch of different types: corn, corn/flour mix, flour, wheat, and they're all good. The open burrito comes with tortilla or chips, if you so desire.  After all that, there's a salsa bar with limited, but excellent, options. The spice level is excellent, and the flavor is as well.  The service is very friendly. They're happy to help you through your order, and they even checked on me as I ate my food, even though there aren't really \"servers\" in the restaurant.  I'l be back many times in the future, because I love the setup of this place, and the food is delicious!",

I'm a hot sauce fiend, but I hoped, based on the reviews here, that the food would hold up without having to drown each bite in salsa.  I was wrong.

Generally I will get the hottest sauce and their sauce had my friend and I drinking some water.   My friend had recently moved here and said he hasn't had some good tacos for years. So this place really got a golden star from him.   The only thing that makes it not a five star is that the women seemed annoyed the whole time while ordering and interacting with other clients. Which they did give me a compliment on my perfume but if they didn't say anything I would have thought differently about the overall service.",

Their review is coming...no bueno. Next day we came back and those fish tacos were da bomb. It came with black beans, rice, and tomatos. Add that jalapeno cream to em' and it took the taco to another level...delish. The only downfall is the fish strips were thin. Not enough meat on the strips. Can you thicken the strips please?

The burritos were very generously sized, but I wish the meat was more flavorful.  also I ordered a side of guac that I wasn't too impressed with in terms of flavor.  I like that they have a salsa bar, although I wish they'd label their salsas with mild, medium, hot.  I'm not a wimp in terms of spice by any means, but every salsa I tried ended up being too hot!

The one thing that brings us back here every time we visit to watch baseball is the churros! They are amazing. Simply they are the best churros we've ever had. Every time they are perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside with a little bit of filling. The caramel they serve with it is a perfect compliment. They are pretty much worth our trip here whether our team wins or loses. Be careful of their hours. They are easy to visit on the weekdays but not open much on Saturday and Sunday.",

I lived in a border town up until my teens and this place brings me back to my childhood, it's real Mexican food.   Service: I love all the workers here. They may not seem like they're super attentive but I think their main priority is getting everyone's food out to them as fast as possible and making sure it's tasty. That's perfectly fine with me because this place can get really slammed where the line is to the door, yet the wait isn't too bad (maybe ten minutes at most).   Decor: I love the decor. LOVE. Especially if you're a fan of Mexican culture, it's really nice to look at and a conversation starter for sure.   Food: I've yet to have something here I haven't enjoyed. The fish tacos and wet burrito (with red chile carnitas) remain my top two faves. The burrito bowls are good, the quesadillas are huge and sizable, and the burritos delicious. I really like that you can customize what you want in and on your food.   Price: similar to Chiptole prices. Some might think this place is a little pricey but for the amount of food they give you and the QUALITY of the food, it's cheap.   I really like this place and love seeing it do well.",

You choose your tacos/burrito/bowl/etc and add ingredients as you wish, but when you choose a meat they scoop it up and grill it to order. Whatever meal you choose it is complimented by chips and a bar full of a wide array of sauces, most of which are must tries.   Service is usually pretty good, however it's price is the one draw back that stops me from making it a standard lunch spot. After a main entree and a drink I'm above my usual price range for lunch, but the food is always worth recommending.",

(There was a Chipotle a quarter mile down the road) I decided to stop in and give this restaurant a chance. Don't judge it by the outside of the building or the lack of parking. The inside was pretty cool to see the drawings and wrestling masks on the wall. The dining area is small but all the customers there are willing to share a table during their busy time. I had eaten there during lunch time on Saturday. A lot of customers are in and out of there getting food which shows you that this place is popular. I had ordered a standard burrito and also the rolled tacos with carne asada and everything on both. It was delicious and I did not have any complaints. If you are sensitive to spicy I suggest requesting the salsa on the side. Overall, I recommend this place. You should give it a shot if you haven't tried it. It's not better than Chipotle. It's similar but has different flavor. If I am back in Phoenix I'll stop by again.",

I really don't care that I spent $12 on my lunch - but what makes me sad about this place is how stingy they've gotten with their portions.  I used to be able to take this bowl, eat half for lunch, and half for dinner... and if I remember, I probably paid less in the past for it!   I had to ask for additional corn and salsa, and was given a 'look' for it as well.  The amount of salsa I was given barely covered the contents of the bowl. The food itself tastes absolutely amazing - I will not deny that... but for the portion size, and the price - I might be considering my future lunch options.",

The steak tacos had a rich flavor which was compounded with the pico and incredible jalapeno sour cream - something that inspired me to make my own in my kitchen. The barbacoa was slightly soggy, but was overlooked because of the sweet hints that good barbacoa has.

It may be a small place but they have about seven tables inside that you can sit at. The food tasted fresh and had lots of flavor compared to other taco shops I have been to. I like that you get to choose what you want on your food. You choose your base and then add on what you want.  The prices are a little on the high side but that's because you are getting better quality food and it's totally worth it!  Service was great. No long lines and didn't have to wait to long for the food. They thanked us for coming as we left.  It's in a outside strip mall area that has a good amount of parking.  You guys have to try this place out! I highly recommend it! I'm definitely coming here again soon!",

    "text": "Why 4 stars? Because it was a solid backup plan.     ---   ---   ---  I have a confession: I did not intend to visit Maskadores. I had it all mapped out - I was going to land, grab my rental car, and head to Little Miss BBQ, which recently was named the #2 restaurant in the U.S. on Yelp.   And then I got to the Little Miss BBQ and they had no parking spots left + an hour and a half wait, which I just couldn't make work. It was a very sad day, but the consolation is that it led me to Maskadores.  Though I was devastated to miss out on this meal I'd looked forward to for weeks, I pulled over into some random parking lot and asked myself, \"Self, what are you in the mood for?\" And because I was in Arizona after all, I decided to Yelp the best Mexican around. Maskadores had great reviews and was close by, so the decision was made pretty quickly!  The line wasn't super long, but it moved slowly, so I had plenty of time to decide on what I wanted. The wet burrito seemed to be the consensus as the top item to order, so that was my plan. There were two different kinds of wet burritos, so I asked for clarification on what a Bandera Wet Burrito was. It turned out that some of the sauce poured on top of the bandera was really spicy, so I asked for jus the regular wet burrito instead.  Unfortunately, it was hard to hear each other and it seemed that the level of English spoken was minimal, so she thought I asked for a (dry) burrito. I normally would have asked them to re-do it, but I was running late for where I needed to be, so I just let it be.  The burrito was solid, but it also didn't taste a ton different than what I could have gotten from Chipotle. Don't get me wrong, I love Chipotle, but I was hoping for something a bit unique while in a new place.  So that was my Maskadores experience. It hit the spot, but just not quite a home run.",

Love me some tacos.   So I had been hearing some buzz from friends about Mucha Lucha Tacos, how they have great street tacos and some hot hot sauces (for me the hotter the better baby! ) so I knew it would only be a matter of time before I checked them out!  When I got their I noticed its so of the same set up as chipotle/cafe rio style of ordering, and after I checked out the menu I went with the 5 street tacos & a bandera wet burrito.  For the tacos, they were red chili chicken, green chili beef and carne asada all topped with cheese, cilantro, pico de gallo and hit with some of their extra hot sauce. OMG SO DANG GOOD! My lips and my mouth were on fire, but I did not care! Each taco had their own great flavor, but I think next time I will skip out on the carne asada and keep with the green chili beef & red chili chicken. It's not that that carne aside isn't good; it's just not as hot as the other meats.  It was the mild ones of the group.  The Bandera wet burrito I got with green chili beef, rice, whole beans & veggies wrapped in a fresh tortilla topped with green and red sauce & jalapeno cream cheese sauce and also topped with some of the extra hot sauce. OMG this was a huge burrito and also lunch for the next day. I think sitting overnight allowed it to get even hotter, LOVE IT SOO MUCH!!!   Mucha Lucha Tacos do not skip out on the heat, and I love that!  They also have a great little salsa bar and hot carrots and jalapenos too, omg heaven!  Go get you some tacos!",

Detroit has a HUGE Mexican community with some dam good food.  So when I walked into Maskadores I saw this smiling young man greeting me.  He was cocky about how good his food was.  My wife and I ordered the 3 Taco meal and a Breakfast Bowl.  HOLY SH@T, that young man had every right to be cocky.  The food was AMAZING. The selections, the flavors and the freshness blew me away. Sorry Tia but damn his food blows yours away.  Before I left the restaurant I did have one complaint, I told the young man that his napkins were too soft LOL, I had to complain about something.

The collection of self-serve salsas are amazing, and are spicy in the way that salsas should be - the spice ADDS to the taste, instead of covering it up.

Everything tastes homemade-from the irregular tortillas, to the bar of salsas, in particular the serrano salsa, and marinated meats.  I could taste each ingredient separately and also as a whole. My first bite into a chipotle chicken burrito revealed the flavor of well seasoned beans, rice, and a marinade that soaked every crevice of the chicken. All the vegetables tasted fresh with a strong bite and the homemade guacamole, a little too sour, worked well as part of the whole. I was worried at first that the burrito would be too salty but every bit was perfectly seasoned.  I have yet to try many of the other wonders here and plan to stop by more. I will keep you updated.  My one critique would be to balance the guacamole with maybe a little less lime and little bit more salt.",

    "text": "Had the pleasure of trying this place out for the first time today. Really great choice if you want some fresh and flavorful Mexican Food.   After choosing what you want to eat you can decide what ingredients you want inside the same way you would at a Chipotle. My friend ordered four street tacos ($5.59) and I ordered the wet burrito (~$8). We were really impressed by the various types of meats they offered here, I think there was about 5 or 6. My friend got each of his tacos a different flavor and then the man working, who I think was the owner let us sample the flavors we didn't get. We both agreed that all of them were amazing. Watch out for the green chili though, the spice tends to sneak up on you! My wet burrito was also fantastic. However I will probably switch to the pork next time instead of the red chicken and pass on the roasted corn.   As we were getting ready to leave the owner asked us if it was our first time there and if we enjoyed the meal. We meant it when we said we would be coming back! Overall we were really happy with the food and excellent customer service.",

The workers were friendly and asked me if I had been here before, where I was from, etc.  I can't wait to go back as there are a number of things I'd like to try with a large assortment of different meats for whatever you order.

Spicy with just the right amount of bitter. Their selection of meats is more varied than most, and every one I have tried has knocked it out of the park. Their Carne asada is cooked fresh on their full view cast iron grill. Hands down the best green Chile beef I have ever had. Red Chile carnitas. Barbacoa. Tinga chicken. White breast chicken. The hardest part is choosing which one.  Their fillings and toppings, while not great in number makes up in quality. Fresh sour cream, pickled and raw onions, cilatro, corn, amazing guacamole (some of the best non-homemade I've had), along with the requisite beans and rice make a great compliment to the protein offerings.  Last but not least is the salsa bar with 5-6 fresh salsas depending on the day. Hot, medium, mild, Pico, jalapenos, fresh peppers, and what I like to call 'the green stuff'. Very, very hot but don't be afraid of it! Has a creamy hummus-like consistency that adds a potent jalapeno punch. Tasty. Best of all? I don't feel like I need a shower after scarfing down a burrito here (I'm looking at you Filibertos).  So, yeah, overall I like it a little.",

That consisted of Chips with Jalapeno cream sauce- a new way for me anyways, to eat chips, if like me, you're looking for something different than salsa or guacamole dips. The jalapeno taste was balanced, not hot, not too mild. If you're having a party, one bag of chips is too small, get more, and add an order of salsa, guacamole, and jalapeno cream. They don't have quesadillas on the menu, so if that's your thing, have a plan B. There is a condiment cart with fresh home made sauces and lime wedges as you walk out. Mucha kucha is local, authentic, small, and the decor fits The nane, Extra coolness! Bilinguals don't be shy out of  ordering your food in Spanglish, English or Spanish. \"Comida a Toda Mecha!\"- Mari La Cubana",

Apparently it's crazy at lunch, and there isn't much seating inside--but we were there from 5:30 to 7 p.m. on a Thursday and it was pretty empty.  The staff are wonderful, and will do whatever to make sure you are customizing your meal to your preference. They offer samples of their different meats.  The guacamole was authentic, but not very flavorful (again, downside of being authentic)--everything else far made up for it. They have a salsa bar, and make your quesadilla/tacos/burrito/whatever you wish right in front of you, adding whichever ingredients you'd like as they go. I got a quesadilla with red chili chicken, which was flavorful and very delicious. The quesadillas are HUGE.  Very low prices.  I'll be back!",

One was open-mouth chewing gum over my tacos as she put the toppings on. The other completely butchered our order. For fear of causing too much confusion, we hit the bullet and ate what we were given. Again, it was very good. So no complaints on the food taste.   I ordered 3 tacos but was told that \"due to their register\" I could not have 3 different meat selections, only 2.   I've heard great things about Mucha Lucha, but it appears this one might be the black sheep seeing as how they now go by Maskadores. I'll try a different location next time.",

I loved that their salsa was actually spicy and they also had a milder option. And no I'm not talking about the salsa bandera. This place has great food. If I could say one critic is that these poor ladies need some help with someone charging/cleaning. Well at least during the peak hours. Other than that, great little gem in Tempe!

For an average of $7, you can enjoy a build your own burrito, chips, and home-made horchata.  Build with savory selections such as barbacoa, green chile, chicken, or carnitas.  They have all of the fresh ingredients of your choice such as cilantro, roasted corn, pinto and black beans, shredded oaxacan cheese, and pico de gallo.   The beauty of this little gem is you are choosing what goes into your dish.  I had the ambrosial barbacoa with pinto beans, a heaping of fresh cilantro, a medium hot salsa, and generous dollops of their signature jalapeno cream cheese.  The savory combined with the salty and spicy, balanced by the fresh and citrus-like flavor of the cilantro made this a phenomenal burrito.  On the menu are also fresh soft and crispy tacos, and tostadas.  Highly recommended not only for the flavors, but the cleanliness and friendliness of this Taqueria.",

My boyfriend got the tostadas. He's a huge fan of Mexican food and thinks this place is pretty great.  We also got some horchata, which was delicious.

The food is seriously great. Fresh, home-cooked, and high quality. I only tried the nachos. The chips are thin and crispy and the carne asada is some of the best I have ever had. They make it any way you want it and they have a ton of protein options. The ladies that run this place are the best; fast, friendly and great cooks. Try it.",

They also have a small salsa bar with fresh lime wedges, which was a nice touch. I will definitely eat here again!",

There's a salsa bar off to the side with some kick ass salsas (omg one of them is literally fire so watch out).   I am used to ordering tacos a la carte, but this place makes you order 5 at a time. Didn't think I would finish them all, but I did feeling content. These street tacos are SMALL. But at least they are tasty. I ordered the carne asada and fried fish tacos. The fish was alright; the chipotle mayo sauce made it way better.   Not bad on the first go, I just wish I didn't have to order 5 at a time. I wish I could have ordered one of everything instead of bundle packages. Pricing was fair. Oh well, I'll be back to try something new!   Environment: 5/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 3/5 Service: 5/5",

Luckily my workplace is close by so no excuses with not being able to come more often. I love how the walls are adorned with luchadores (wrestlers) with brilliant color schemes in this quaint taco shop. The menu is simple and you get to create your own tacos, burrito, etc. Today I went with the 5 corn street taco meal. When you select the 5 tacos, you do have the choice of 2 meats.  A hard decision to make, but I went with 2 carne asada and 3 barbacoa (seasoned shredded beef) tacos. Topped them off with cilantro and onions. The salsa bar which is free is spicy but delicious, so I added the guacamole salsa. I must admit the flavors were just as savory as when I came in a year ago.  The freshness of the tortillas and the meats were apparent from how the ladies that work behind the counter prepared the food as you ordered. All in all a worthwhile experience from a local Tempe taco shop! So this only means I will be making more frequent trips during my lunch hour!  Cheers.",

Shrimp tacos, rolled tacos, street tacos, tacotillas, machos...bring it all! Plus OMG!  The breakfast burrito is AHHHHMAZING!   We tried every meat, all are great, the barbacoa is tender, the chicken was perfect for the 6 year old not ready for spicey. Red carnitas is hot and juicy, and plain carnitas is fall apart wonderful. The shrimp was big and fresh.  Everything is made to order, the place is clean, the salsa is hot and the service is great.  My only complaint is they only seem to be able to do one entree at a time, so it could be faster, but why rush perfection. Of course my husband was paying while we were eating(who can wait?) And was convinced it would be all gone before he sat down! Not True, but tempting!  Get to Mascadores and prepare for the best street food ever! Can't wait to come back.",

I did a Yelp search for a lunch in Tempe since I work on the Phoenix border and decided on coming here based on the great Yelp reviews.  I walk in and there's a line of ten, part of me is like \"go to the kabob place next door\" and the other part of me is like \"if there's a line it's worth it\". It took me about 10 minutes to get to the front to order.  I opted for a wet chimichanga with red sauce and sour cream, filled with carne asada, rice, black beans, veggies and cheese. It took them about five minutes to get everything completed, imagine chipotle if the ingredients were more authentic and more fresh.  Finding a seat wasn't too difficult because most people seem to opt to take out, which I might do in the future as well.   The first bite was amazing and it only got better. That red sauce had a kick, which I don't usually like but my god the flavors were there. I cannot believe this is a little hole in the wall taco shop. The food justifies the price, I was really impressed.   P.S. The murals on the wall are super dope, this may be the cleanest taco  shop I've ever been to.",

I was happy to pay that upcharge for a good fried fish taco, but what I got was basically deep fried batter with no actual fish meat in it. The red carnitas and carne asada were better, but the guy making them was being really stingy with the portions. I'm really disappointed overall-probably the worst taco experience I've ever had. I feel like I got ripped off-avoid the fried fish!!",

    "text": "If you're looking for a clean, authentic, inviting Mexican restaurant Maskadores should be your first stop. Maskadores is a Lucha Libre themed atmosphere with bright colored walls accompanied by great service. The menu ranges from Crunchy tostadas, to flavorful flour street tacos, and my favorite the wet Bandera burrito.  As you enter Maskadores you are greeted by their very polite employees. Maskadores models a Chipotle, or Qdoba order system. The flavorful options are listed above and then as you move through the line you can completely customize your choice to your personal preference. There truly is nothing better than making your meal exactly how you want it. This model also reduces the wait time of your food. Unless you hit a lunch rush you should move through the line and have your food in a matter of minutes.  When I venture to Maskadores, which is fairly frequently, I usually decide between the Wet Bandera Burrito or the Super Fries. The Wet Bandera is filled with your choice of meat, canre asada, chicken, shrimp, barbacoa, etc... Rice and beans are next, and then your very hard decision salsas and all other typical Mexican burrito fillings. The thing that sets this burrito apart from all others is its enchilada style serving and their special jalapeno cheese sauce on top. This sauce is incredible. With my burrito I chose the carne asada route which is cooked on the grill in front of you to a flavorful mouthwatering perfection. I then decided on white rice and pinto beans which are always my preferred preference. Next, I stuffed the burrito with their habanero salsa, which is eye watering hot, so steer clear if you're are not looking for a spicy kick. I then followed the salsa up with sour cream which was a great consistency, not too runny and not too thick, and lettuce and cheese. All this is stuffed in a tortilla that was waiting on the grill so it is nice and warmed. Once the burrito is rolled I had it draped in the more Habanero hot sauce and jalapeno cream cheese. WARNING: This burrito is huge!  All in all, Maskadores is my favorite Mexican food place in the valley. The prices are reasonable but not cheap. I found the quality of food is well worth the few extra dollars over other authentic Mexican restaurants. I would highly recommend Maskadores to anyone searching for a go to Mexican restaurant. I tend to stick to my favorites at Maskadores, but I have taken many people there who have tried most other things on the menu and everyone has absolutely loved it. Maskadores offers a family friendly environment, displays the Mexican culture in a fun extravagant way, and greets you with very kind, inviting employees. The food is wonderful and cooked in front of you. It leaves you full excited for the next trip back. In conclusion, I would give Maskadores a 4.9 star out of 5 star simply because I'm always looking for somewhere better, but after my experience at Maskadores I'm not sure I will find any better.",

It's a nice atmosphere, clean and of course a line (which is always a good indicator that the food is good)   I started off with their street tacos with carne asada and man I was impressed. The corn tortilla was fresh and the meat was tasty. They were topped with cheese and of course I had to attack their salsa bar. Drenching my tacos in tons of lime juice and tomatillo salsa is a must.  Next I ordered the super nachos. Which they let you customize them in a way (like a chipotle) .. they were good, I have no complaints.. they have a variety of meats to choose from but I stuck with the carne asada. The chips are thin, crispy and fresh.   So to summarize my whole lunch experience I gave them a 5 star.. I was very happy with my food choices and there was a line but it moved fast (considering I went during lunch rush hour) the place is a little small but it's definitely family friendly. But what really set this place apart from other is they didn't charge me extra for guacamole. That blew my mind and I will be back:)",

    "text": "I rarely find a place that it so outstanding it requires a Yelp review, but I just ate dinner here and I had to come to Yelp immediately to sing its praises. I had the tinga chicken street tacos (comes with 5 tacos for $6.99 and your choice of meats.) You can mix and match up to three meats if you want to sample more flavors, but I decided to stick with just the chicken. Incidentally, I tried to order two fish and three chicken tacos, but they will not let you mix fish with the other meat choices, which was fine by me.   My son had the fish tacos (he also chose the street tacos.) You also get to choose from a variety of toppings. I stuck with the standard cilantro, pickled onions and pico, and then topped it off with a squeeze of lime, offered up at the salsa bar, and some medium salsa- not that they needed any extra flavor, but this just made it over the top delicious. My son added roasted corn and white onions to his, along with lettuce. The fish tacos also came with an optional jalapeno cream cheese, which he indulged in.   Everything on my plate was fresh and cooked to perfection. When you order, they place your portion of meat on the grill and grill it up alongside your tortillas.   I finished off the meal with a Mexican Coke. My son had the horchata, which he said he didn't love the flavor of, but it seems it just had a spice he didn't like, so I can't hold that against them.  The service was very friendly, and the staff didn't even seem to mind that we had come in roughly ten minutes before they closed (Not intentionally- I wouldn't have done that if I'd known they were closing.) They let us eat in and told us not to rush our meal. I never got the sense that we were being rushed or that anyone resented us being there.   Atmosphere is very casual, as a taco joint should be. They were playing Mexican pop music and I almost felt like I was transported to Mexico. Also, A+ on the mucha libre decorations painted on the walls and Mexican wrestling masks completing the theme.",

Like most people say, this place can be hard to find--it's on Broadway and Hardy right across the street from the industrial district. It has a yellow sign that says \"Taqueria\" on it. Why it doesn't say Sombreros, we'll never know.   I had a vegetarian burrito which came with corn, rice, black beans (of which you get to choose from two types of bean), lettuce, and some spicy sauce they had. You also get to choose from a chipotle, spinach, flour, or corn tortilla. I had the spinach and it was very tasty. Came with a side of some old, forgettable tortilla chips as well. The total was 6 bucks EXACTLY, which made the OCD part of my brain shiver with delight. You might refer to this place as a cheaper, possibly healthier \"Chipotle.\"   The decorations and furnishings inside are nice, modern with a touch of old-world Mexico. The three ladies working behind the counter lend the place a very authentic feel--it's quite obvious these three have made a LOT of tortillas in their lifetimes.   Unfortunately it only gets 3 stars. Maybe in South Dakota or Iowa, or any place that doesn't have 3 great Mexican restaurants within spitting distance like Tempe, AZ this restaurant would merit an extra star.",

We were promptly greeted and asked if we had been there before. Once we said now we were handed tons of samples and thoroughly explained the menu to us. Man, it was hard to choose because they have so many meet options and they all tasted so good. I went with the green chili pork and my husband went with steak. Both were ridiculous! I love how they have healthy options too like wheat tortillas and black beans. The jalapeno cream cheese was also very good. I'd love to smother that all over a bagel in the morning. Try this place people! You won't regret it!!!",

I ordered the street tacos with no cheese, extra cilantro, pico de gallo and pickled red onions - topped off with a squirt of lime to the last drop. Oh how delicious. The churro also hit the spot. I dont know if there was custard in it or if it was just uncooked dough, but I ate it anyway and it was good  :-)  The staff are fast, efficient and pleasant.  My go-to for Mexican food!",

Street-Style Servings.  The proteins (chicken, beef, pork) are slow cooked in their chile sauces--oh muh goodness, People...  First-timers: I recommend the 5 Street Tacos, this way you can sample most of their proteins & chile flavors (5 small tacos = really filling). It's a small, super casual joint with bright, colorful walls.  They have 10-15 small tables, a salsa bar, and a simple, straightforward menu.  Fantastic service as well: really nice, patient employees/owners.  Only recommendation is that they label their salsa's (mild, hot, etc) on the salsa bar.",

I know that people aren't eating burrito bowls in Guadalajara, but maybe they should. I got the chicken tinga and had the very kind, helpful attentive people behind the counter pile on all the hot s@#t they had. My husband got the green beef and did likewise. We sat there sweating, our lips burning, in an act similar to self-mutilation because it was just that good. If I had any complaints at all it was that the water cups were pitifully small, and I ended up taking two back to the table at one point so I wasn't refilling it every second; beer would have been a nice way to cut some of the heat. I am willing to overlook this and submit 5 stars, however, because we had a damn fine meal for 15 bucks while enjoying the murals of Mexican wrestlers and service from some nice people. We'll be back.",

I was blown away by the flavor and the friendliness of the ladies working I had to come back the next day!  I ordered 6 corn tacos trying each meat and also a carne asada quesadilla on a chipotle tortilla.  Each meat was so tender and delicious!  Their jalapeno cream cheese was a magnificent addition to the tacos.  The best part? It's very affordable!   Bean and cheese burrito + chips & guacamole + 6 corn tacos + carne asada quesadilla + 2 Mexican Coca-Colas + friendly workers = $25.  Believe all the great reviews!

They're tiny little tacos but they stuff those bad boys. You can pick 3 out of 5/6 different flavored meats, I got carne, pork, & chicken. And add toppings like onions, cheese, cilantro, sour cream, etc. I must say they are very flavorful. Added some of the creamy green sauce they offer on the side for added flavor and kick. Definitely authentic and get a good amount for your buck here. Would definitely come back. Just wish they took Card and served margaritas lol",

We ordered regular chicken nachos and just that simple request was met by a woman who speaks ZERO English... She looked at us like WE didn't know what we were talking about, but in all reality she had no damn clue what we were saying. A young man came out of the kitchen to help (obvious he knew she needed help speaking to us) and he apparently made matters worse because there was a thin layer of chicken on some crappy chips, and there was... No cheese... WHO DOESNT PUT FREAKING CHEESE ON NACHOS?! These guys. That's who.  The woman proceeded to ask us if we wanted this and that topping, we got nearly every topping and the nachos were still dry. I don't think I could've been more disappointed. Ps: the horchata was mediocre at best.",

The tacos aren't terribly big so if you're starving you'll probably want to order quite a few.   I had the barbacoa beef burrito bowl.. Yum yum yum! The beef was very juicy and melted in my mouth.

In a modest, slightly dingy strip mall sits Sombrero's, a small little eatery serving slow cooked, marinated meats, with your choice of various fillings and tortillas.  I stepped in today to try a tasty burrito. You have your choice of meats such as barbacoa, carnitas, carne asada, and chicken. Tortilla choices include tomato basil, chipotle, spinach, wheat, and regular flour. They offer fillings such as pinto beans, black beans, cheese, rice, lettuce, roasted corn, onions, cilantro, and salsa. Freshly made guacamole and jalapeno cream cheese can be added for an extra charge.   I opted for the barbacoa, with tomato basil tortilla, pinto beans, rice, onions, cheese, guacamole, and spicy salsa. The meat was tender and flavorful. The accompanying ingredients meshed well with the barbacoa. The spicy salsa is indeed quite hot, and packs a punch!  I also tried some horchata ($1.99), which was refreshing and creamy.  Service was friendly and cheerful. My burrito was made quickly, and check out at the cashier was easy.  Sombrero's is definitely a good place for a filling meal!",

Five star worthy but only three stars because the salsa is almost too spicy to eat. They will ask you if you want salsa in your tacos and in their defense they do call it \"hot\" but this is some next level stuff. Do not order salsa on your tacos or other food unless you are really truly prepared for it. And even if you think you are prepared, maybe still get it on the side. You have been warned.

Whenever I visit a place in the Tempe/Phx area receiving loads of rave reviews, I come in with reserved expectations because this area loves bland food. And that's what the barbacoa and tinga are, soaking wet, watery meats lacking the oils and proper levels of cooked-in spice. The chicken texture was very dry. The carne asada is just alright, better flavors there from spice, but im never a fan of well done beef.   Packaged tortillas are just lazily thrown on the grill for a few seconds to warm up and not even flavored, or seasoned, or given a light browning or crisping for texture. The just serve as a soggy vehicle for your taco meats.   The salsa bar is the star, the green tomatillo sauce brings you serious heat that creeps on you at the end. The chunky smoked jalapeno \"relish\" is also a delicious spicy topping.   Service is friendly and they do a great job of moving quickly thru a large group of people.   Again, these are not bad tacos. But they are definitely not 5-star, \"OMG so Authentic!\" tacos. Tacos are serious business to me and they do not come close to the effort and attention that La Merced, Sahuaro, or Tepehuaje put into the tacos they provide.",

I went with the 5 street taco combo and I was hoping to try 5 different meats but was told I could only choose 2 which was fine. I went with one of the pork varieties and one of the chicken varieties I think (I can't quickly find their menu while typing this so I don't exactly remember). I got all 5 of them with the standard street taco toppings of onions and cilantro.  I got each of the sauces available to sample and a bunch of limes to squirt over the tacos, and most combinations of meat and sauces were pretty good, but again, nothing spectacular that I haven't already had back up in Connecticut. I guess I was just hoping for something next level down in Arizona?  While I was only slightly annoyed at only being able to choose 2 meats for my street tacos, I became more annoyed when someone in line after me asked the same worker I had if he could do 5 different meats for his street tacos and they went along with it.  So, while there was absolutely nothing wrong with the place, I can't say I'd go out of my way again to go there since the tacos weren't anything special and there's plenty of other options in the area to choose from.",

The portions were good for the price, but the tostadas were a touch on the small side. The reason I'm only giving three stars is because the two ladies working the food line were rude and completely unprofessional. My girlfriend asked if they had a menu available, and the two women just looked at her and said \"no.\" Now, granted there is a menu posted above eye level, on the wall next to the order counter. But my girlfriend didn't see it, and instead of offering her guidance or help, they just blew her off. Once she found the menu, she said, \"oh, it's posted right there.\" The two girls just looked at her and said, \"yep.\" Service in general was very blah.  Hopefully it was just an off day.",

Oh, and it's uber small, so definitely don't try to bring a large group here... or really any more than 2-3 people. It would be nice if they could set a few outside tables on the outside. During dinner, the line can get a little long. Worth the wait though, they take care of you at Maskadores.    Get a plate of their 5 tacos and pay the upcharge to get a variety of meats. Forewarning, they are a bit spicy, especially combined with their least-spiciest salsa (applied before your plate is handed to you). I was a little disappointed at how spicy it was altogether, but thus is life in the Southwest. I liked the carne asada though. Worth coming back to spend another $10 and try another round of tacos without all the heat.",

Looking forward to coming back as I ordered five taco plate. The restaurant is not so big so a lot of people get their orders to go but if you are able to get a table sit down, grab some salsa and other condiments from the minibar and get a Mexican style soda out of the fridge versus the fountain.   I arrived with only about 40 minutes left and apparently I caught the rush at the end of the night so I thought everything was a little bit rushed, however, it was still good. The one thing I was missing was some chips to go along with my tacos but you can get just about anything from onion cilantro cheese pico de gallo and more placed on your taco just try not to go overboard angel not get a chance to enjoy the meet.  The decor is suiting to all things Tempe, which I luv, as they have murals painted on the wall of fighters celebrating the spirit of the fighter. Next trip I'm planning to try the Nachos and burro as they looked pretty good!",

Took a chance with this spot because although it had great ratings on Yelp, there weren't a ton of reviews. Sooooo glad we did!! The food was amazingly delicious and exactly what we were looking for! It's kind of Chipotle style in that they make your food in front of you and ask you what toppings you want as you go down the line. We got carne asada nachos with the works (including guacamole and the jalapeno cream cheese which costs extra but is definitely worth it) and a chicken taco and a regular pork taco. All were fantastic! We'll definitely be coming back to visit when we're back for Spring Training next year!",

This is my second year back and while i did find some things enjoyable about Mucha Lucha Taco Shop I still didn't think it was anything to brag about. I ordered a Grilled Fish burrito (it was Friday and it's lent go figure). I was disappointed to hear that they were out of the Fried Fish Burrito and it was only 6pm. The fish for the Grilled Fish looked a little suspect I want to say it was Cod, but It wasn't the best looking fish. The burrito itself was quite big, but it didn't have much taste to it. There was some red hot sauce in it that was super spicy and kind of disguised the whole thing. They do give you chips, but it's not that much. Overall, the staff was friendly and I liked the whole Luchador theme of the shop. My girlfriends Shrimp burrito was much better (yeah I took some bites). I wouldn't mind giving this spot one more go next time I'm in the area to give it my final judgement.",

From there you can pick out 5 of their best tacos for $7.50... $7.50!!! For a taste that took me back to when I'd drive from San Diego to Tijauna just for the authentic experience of a proper Mexican street taco.  I'll be back on a weekly basis!! Super friendly staff that was helpful and accommodating made it even that much better.",

I am a huge fan of their green chile. Very spicy but not so spicy that you miss all the other flavors. Staff is always friendly and the crowd is usually interesting to watch while eating alone (I'm sure they're watching me back...)  Food and service aside, you can't help but be entertained by a restaurant with a disco ball as a permanent fixture.",

    "text": "Congratulations!  You whole heartedly earned a one star review for your poor customer service.     My wife and I were in line waiting to order and we weren't sure what we wanted.  No one was in line behind us and after being asked what we wanted I replied that we were not ready to order.  She asked again what we wanted and I quite politely said we were not ready to order.  She asked a third time and I repeated myself in a volume that would be heard but not yelling by any stretch of the imagination.     She huffed off into the back where she stayed for about three minutes.  She came back out with cleaning supplies and proceeded to clean the line.  She proceeded to ignore us as we patiently waited in line for over 5 additional minutes as she cleaned.  When a customer finally walked in behind us she spoke over us and asked what they wanted.  Clearly she was ignoring us over what was a simple lack of clear communication most probably caused by the loud noise of the kitchen.  This was simply hilarious to watch.    The worst part about all of this was watching her attempt to clean the line.  Seeing the water from the steel scrubbing pad spill into all of the surrounding bowls of rice, meats and veggies was very sickening.  I looked at my wife to see if she was seeing what I was seeing.  We were both disgusted.    Why did we stay?  We wanted to see how long she would ignore us!  Like I said it was a pathetic attempt to punish a paying customer over your inability to hear.  Nice job, you earned this one star.",

Prepared fresh in front of you, and there wasn't an ingredient that tasted below a 5 star rating. This tortilla was very fresh and the meat was excellent- I ordered a wet burrito with ground beef. I got just about everything you could inside. The red sauce is a little spicy, and of course I added hot sauce inside, so my mouth was on fire, but in the best way possible. Guacamole is extra, but very worth it. I would definitely go back here, almost before any sit-down Mexican restaurant!",

It's great for lunch, family dinner, family outing, to hit before you head downtown or to the club, and ideal for that cute couples outing.

I ordered my food to go, because I'd definitely start crying if it was garbage. I was in that kind of mood. So I took it back to work..and took a bite..and almost quit my job!! That enchilada was all I ever needed! Whatever. ..However ..that tortilla was blessed...ohhh Gerrd! I felt like I could develop super powers with that enchilada! Life changing! The spice was right!

The sauce that envelops the burrito was superlative  I managed to eat my way thru about three fourths of this monstrosity of goodness and decided to take the rest for a snack.  I am excited about coming back here to check out the other items that they offer.  So all in all a worthwhile investment of my time and money.  I would definitely recommend this place.

But this spot officially has the best rolled tacos I have ever had. I mean truly. They are so so SOOO good.   I went with carnitas, which they put on top of the delicious rolled tacos. They put cheese or potato or some sort of filling in them I couldn't quite tell. Then the meat on top and you pick your toppings. I got the jalapeno cream, pico, cilantro, lettuce and cheese although there are many other options. They were quick and I am still dreaming about them.   My girlfriend got the carne asada flour tacos. She likes things plain so she just got cheese and the meat, but even she said they were still really good. The meat was tender and tasty and the tortillas were great.   We also got some chips and a churro. They were great as well. The decor is cool and there are a few tables inside to sit at. Honestly I will absolutely be back. Incredible tacos and friendly service. You order at the counter and get your food there too.",

    "text": "This review is solely based off of the Burrito Bowl only. I've never heard of this place but I love \"Chipotle's\" style of dining ... i.e Hummus Express.  I'm not a huge fan of the Chipotle brand but love the theme.  I stumbled upon Maskadores Taco shop while searching for something similar to Chipotle.  Yesterday on my first visit I ordered the Burrito Bowl with Chipotle flavored chicken with rice, black beans, raw onions, pickled onions, cilantro, lettuce, red sauce and sour cream on the side.  Before ordering I asked to sample the different options of beef.  They were all tasty, but lacked salt.  Unfortunately I had a fatty piece in both of my samples so I decided to go with the chicken.   Upon first time I thought, man this is tasty.  I could taste the flavors of every single thing that was in my bowl... everything.  However, I did find that although the food was flavorful it lacked salt.  Yes you read that correctly.  It was a flavorful - salt less dish.  That didn't concern me much because once I added a little simple S & P, that burrito bowl came to life. It was big enough for leftovers so I ate the rest the following day for lunch and it was just as good.  I'll definitely return ... probably next week for lunch :)",

Went to the bathroom to wash my hands and there was no soap, the toilet paper was all wet and did I mention it's creepy trying to get in?  The ladies working there were rude when I told them that my horchata tasted like 100% milk. She said \"yeah that's what an horchata is\" umm... no, it's not, but that is an ingredient *eye roll*  She snatched it and threw it in the trash and handed me another cup. I guess that was her way of saying \"I apologize, would you like a soda?\"  There was a huge gaping hole in the ceiling where air was blowing threw. A minute later my food was cold. The workers sat there talking about how I didn't like the horchata.  Food was okay.  No one should eat cold tacos with milk listening to the servers talk crap about you.",

Worth a try, might like it more than me...",

My favorite set up for a guaranteed good night is their two carne asada tostadas with hot salsa (I don't usually like spicy, but their sauce was just too good) with a large horchata. My husband's favorite is their three soft tacos with carne asada and carnitas.

We had tostadas with the pork and green chili pork they both came with the mashed pintos   Very good.  Got the carne asado quesadilla. It was so good.  Got 3 street tacos and 3 hard tacos.  The tacos are a great deal.  $.99 a piece or the meal with a drink for $3.99.  Salsas are great and the gauc is the real deal.   We will be going back!   So good and fresh!",

Be prepared for a little bit of a line and little seating options during lunch, which lets be honest, is usually a great sign of a business. I highly recommend stopping by when you are around here.",

After waiting for 4 or 5 minutes without being acknowledged, I asked the woman if we could seat ourselves.  She sneered \"no\" and continued texting.  Another very nice waitress came over and eventually got us situated at a little table on the patio. Service was good from then on, food was fine, drinks were fine.  A-ok.",

The jalapeno cream was the business. Make sure you throw that in your burrito too!",

The employees are so personable.  I got this vibe the first time I went as the customers and staff exchanged friendly banter while the staff diligently executed their taco making duties. But it wasn't just a fluke; the people that work here are awesome. It is definitely a business I want to support. They in exchange can support my frequent appetite for fish tacos. I may even go so far as to explore other menu options and diverse my taco experience.",

I walked in to the small shop about 20 minutes 'til closing and it looked like just the owner/cook and his daughter manning the ship. I spent some time scanning the menu and when I was ready he helped take my order. I had a burrito with red chile chicken and most of the fixins. They were out of cheese for the night so I got some guacamole gratis which was nice. While the daughter was ringing me up he gave me a sample of their taquitos they have coming out which was good. I drove home and dug in to my burrito, chips and salsa, and horchata. The horchata was on par, their hot salsa is in fact hot and very good. The burrito was really good - it seemed standard before biting into it but it's very flavorful which must be a testament to the care that goes into making all of the ingredients. I'l definitely be back.",

The sign above the building calls the place Taqueros and it was not until I walked up that I saw it was called Sombrero's Mexican Grill.  The place is colorful and clean and the women that work there (the owners?) are really nice.  Originally I was struck by the way they seemed to rip off Chipotle's business model and Somburros name but the lack of originality does not even matter.  They run a clean operation!   My husband loves chipotle and I hate it (because my burrito always ends up being ice cold) preferring the greasier -burtos joints.  Sombrero's is our happy median.  I can get a wheat tortilla, pinto beans that are actually vegetarian (unlike Chipotle's pork laden beans), deliciously spicy green sauce and free chips.  It is a really good value and if you frequent chipotle I would encourage you to make the switch to Sombrero's and support local business!",

We got the bandera wet burrito, the street tacos, the regular tacos, and a cheese crisp for my picky son.  To start out I decided I would just have one of each type of taco, and one bite from each end of the burrito. My final decision is that this food is FANTASTIC!!! Biting into these items was like a flavor explosion in my mouth. Since there were so many toppings to choose from, I told them to out everything except for guacamole on my food. Recommendation, when going to someplace new let the workers guide you. The toppings that they put on were a perfect blend and complimented each other well.  I can honestly say that I am satisfied with my good purchase tonight. I will definitely be back in the near future, although probably just for one entree as the portions are petty big.",

No one should ever have to settle for microwaved American cheese over tortilla chips (or worse, Taco Bell) when there's such an amazing, authentic place right here in Tempe! And they have cool wall art! In all seriousness, definitely give Mucha Lucha a try if you haven't before. Fantastic food, and a great price!",

I ordered five tacos (barbacoa, green chile beef, chicken adobo, and carne asada). The tortillas tasted like they came from the grocery store. The meats were ALL lukewarm. The servers were in constant turmoil as they took an order from a group of five people. One guy in front of us left because they couldnt finish in order in time and kept messing it up.    Most of the meats were not that great. I imagine they would be great if they were actually hot. The green chile beef was actually hot, although the burn came later (probably due to being lukewarm). I didnt like the fact that the sauces were only behind the counter. Im so use to having sauce available on the table. I was not impressed by what they had to offer. It maybe good have been good, but they need to step their game up.",

She says it's delicious with the jalapeno creme cheese and spicy sauce. What she's ranting and raving about is the horchata. She says that it tastes like vanilla ice cream but melted haha. I tried a taste and I thought it tasted like a shake. She wishes that she had more because she finished it before we even got home and we only live down the street.

The meats here are incredibly good, you really can't go wrong no matter what you pick. All the toppings are fresh or cooked fresh, just mouth watering.   Service is great, and atmosphere is cozy.

I ended ordering something I didn't want because there was no explanation of the menu items and no one working spoke English well enough to have a conversation with.  FYI- if you go here go with someone who understands the menu to guide you.  I was a little worried that I made a huge mistake, but despite not ordering correctly, the food was very good.  It gets two stars for poor service and lack of product labeling.  I'm not psychic if you don't label the menu and the salsa how am I to know what's spicy and what's not.   I ordered meat lovers tacos-FYI no choice of meat with that. When I tried to ask about making a selection the service person looked at me like I was a stupid gringa. Next; Chips and salsa but if you want a mild salsa you have to play go fish nothing is labeled.  I am not inclined to visit this place again.",

Everything is freshly prepared and there's a lot of variety for a small hole in the wall. There are 5-6 salsas to go with the chips they give with every order or to use on the burrito. One time they were out of my favorite sauce and I asked if they had more in the back. The guy behind the counter said he'd make some more. About 5 minutes later he came out with a freshly blended batch... it was amazing as always.  $7.50 will buy you a burrito, and it's worth every penny.",

My kid loved the tacos but liked one of the chicken ones best.  The beans are whole bean and not refried.  I tried the steak quesadilla and it was quite plain.  Paid extra for the jalapeno cream cheese on the side and that was my favorite part of the meal.  The soda machine was flat the day we ate here.",

    "text": "I feel like this place has been reviewed by high school kids mostly, because it is not a 4 start joint.  The good: This place isn't afraid of the heat. Large selection meats. Affordable.  The not so good: Crap tortillas They skimp on the meat Chipotle like system.  Came in to pick up some tacos to go and ordered 10 of varying meats.  Overall, the meat is decent. It's like a grade above Filibertos.  They measure out the meat very conservatively, using what looks like a quarter cup measuring cup, and the tortillas are run of the mill store bought tortillas, so 5 is enough for one person.  I don't have too much to say negatively, but the food experience on the whole was underwhelming at best.  When I get street tacos, I don't want to be asked about toppings (Chipotle style system), especially with as many meat options as they offer, as each meat pairs with certain taco toppings.  I told them to do it as they do it, and every taco had as much cilantro as meat and some onions.  The balance was off on them.  Also, the girl didn't get my meat selections right.  Just seems like there isn't much effort put into quality/authenticity.  I will gladly pay twice as much for tacos that have some real craftsmanship behind them.  Any ghetto looking taco shop in a shopping center that isn't a bertos clone, will smash this place, and places like Tacos Chiwas completely dominate them on multiple levels.",

I am not a fan of their beans at all but I am not big on ranch or black beans. Everything else was phenomenal and I will definitely be back.",

I work in Tempe town lake and try to make it here twice a week for lunch.  Try the green dip on the sauce bar.  It is made with pablano peppers and has addictive properties that must mirror those of crack cocaine.  These people genuinely appreciate your business.

If you get carne asada say ranchero style... that worked out really good.  I also really like the red chili carnitas, barbacoa beef and green chilie beef.  Oh and if you mix and match meats in the tacos don't try to mix seafood with landfood that blows their mind, it's either surf or turf there will be no mixing.  I'll let you know when I figure out how to try the shrimp tacos :-)",

He even spotted that I had never been here before and offered me samples of the different spicy beef and chicken. I strongly recommend the chicken for its abundant flavor without being \"hot\". The beef had a nice kick to it with two flavorful versions. I had a chicken burrito as well as one of the spicy beef burritos.  Don't be fooled by the location, go in and try the great food. I am also a fan of the real sugar soft drinks from Mexico, the strawberry was a perfect compliment to the rich Mexican style food. The condiment bar is well stocked with a variety of great flavors to enhance your dining pleasure. I think I have to go now, my wheelbarrow just arrived to get me back to my vehicle.

    "text": "UhhhhhMAZING!! We flew in for our annual trip home from GA and were searching for the coveted cows tongue tacos. We were told they did not have them, but on the way out the door the owner said \"wait!! Try a sample of our meats\". WHOA!! Just beyond! In Tempe, they cater to the college crowd in price only!! The rest of the week I was STILL drooling over the taste of our food!! This impromptu stop left us with a dream for the next visit! Fresh, filling and FABULOUS!! See y'all next year!",

    "text": "The flavors are delicious here, authentic chili verde and carne adavado. It's a service line, very casual. They were out of iced tea with no sign on the machine, (as well as grilled corn) which was a bummer. The orders have to be repeated a couple times with pointing, but all in all it is a great place to get some authentic mexican food while on the go. I will definitely be back!!",

    "text": "Why so stingy with the meat on the tacos? The food was good. It did lack a bit of freshness and you can tell by looking at the lettuce. Staff was a bit slow as well. I cook one cashier and one help. There were maybe 6 people in front of me and it took 15 mins before I was able to order. I'm more used to fast paced taco shops. Oh don't order the guac. They don't even fill that little side cup to the top!!! Whack!!!!!!!Anyways...folks won't be coming back anytime soon until I hear they change their ways.",

    "text": "Yep another five for the work 'hood. I drove past this place many times and never, ever would think of stopping in. Thank goodness for my fellow yelpers showing me the way...  Tiny place in a tight, old, somewhat run down strip mall. Minimal parking. Tiny restaurant with maybe 8 tables? And yes two HUGE TVs on either wall loud and proud on a news station - I'm not sure if it was Fox. My first visit was during the noon hour and there was a line. People ordering off of lists for lots of other work folks but it's simple ordering and they are fast.   I listened to what the pros were ordering and everything sounds great. When it was my turn I asked for an 'Open Burrito' not really sure what that was. She grabbed a bowl and asked if I wanted rice, No, beans? Yes, black or pinto? Black. What kind of meat (which later my husband reminded me was Friday during lent whoops) I asked her to describe everything she had - chicken, red pork, green extra spicy, - she had me at extra spicy so I didn't listen to the rest - then the fun stuff - cilantro, cheese, ROASTED CORN, guacamole, sour cream, onions, yes, yes, yes!  Do you want a tortilla? Spinach, plain, Chipotle - yes that. Then they had a side bar with more chile sauces, limes, onions, jalapenos, I got limes and red chile.   About $7+ dollars later I walked back to work with my bowl. It was amazing, fresh, perfectly cooked meat, super spicy and flavorful. All the extras made it incredible. I decided this is where I'm spending my one day out at lunch until further notice. And I can walk.   I wanted to immediately write a review but I made myself go a second time to make sure it wasn't a fluke. Today was my second visit - fantastic! And I love the staff, so friendly, happy to explain the food. The place is clean very deceptive from the exterior.   One of my new favs!",

    "text": "They no longer put the chicken back on the grill when you order. The chicken is not big chunks of white meat anymore, it is stewed chicken sitting in a broth all day and I'm not even sure it is all white meat anymore. Another issue is the woman who was making the burrito used her gloved hands to fill the burrito with all the toppings. That is fine for rolling, but when your sticking your hand (gloved or not) into each bin of lettuce, corn, tomatoes, cilantro, etc, it just doesn't seem normal. They need to use spoons on thongs for the fillings.",

The staff is extremely friendly and pleasant, the place is clean, and there is usually a good crowd but never a long wait.   I've ordered the asada burrito each time I've gone. It's too good not to get!   Don't miss this place!",
