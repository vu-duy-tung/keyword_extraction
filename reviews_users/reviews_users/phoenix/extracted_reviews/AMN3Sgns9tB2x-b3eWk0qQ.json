Very unassuming location, humble service and owners, but extraordinary Pho.  There was one week that I ate lunch at Pho EVERY day.  It is just that good and I can never seem to get enough.  I highly recommend Pho for the food, service, and atmosphere.  Comfort food at its finest.",

I would say everything is good except I am not a fan of cold spring rolls. I love the presentation of the pho...you get a friggen salad to make your own little creation. The mango chicken is awesome and something I crave often. They make a great Mango spicy shrimp salad that rocks with a little kick. And their Chicken fried rice has ruined me for so many others. It is so good that I can't eat it anywhere else! Great for Carryout or dine in.",

    "text": "Yesterday evening i and a friend ate at the Noodles Ranch. Our meal consisted of the fried egg rolls and Beef Pho with sliced eye of round and brisket. The egg rolls did not come with an adequate amount of herbs to wrap with the lettuce and the Pho had 1/3 the amount of meat of any of the Vietnamese restaurants serving the same dishes.  I informed the owner's wife of this and she asked me if i knew the price of beef these days and then suggested i eat vegetarian or just deal with it. I was astounded by these unbelievably rude remarks paid the bill and left. The Pho was not a real beef Pho, but mostly a noodle soup.  Beware diners. Although he flavors may be good and the location convenient for those of us living in Scottsdale, this place is a rip off and the management is down right rude. I have eaten here for quite a while now but this will be my last meal there.  Beware Noodles Ranch. Your customers will catch on to your tricks   Most importantly beware diners, you will not be getting what you are paying good money for at this restaurant.",

The food is very good, and the pricing is very reasonable for the quality and portion size received. My wife and her family are all Vietnamese (and excellent Vietnamese cooks) and they eat here regularly. Andre is not trying to create a high-end Vietnamese experience such as Slanted Door in San Francisco, but rather a reasonably priced family restaurant that people will visit several times a month. His pho is quite good (although it loses something when purchased for takeout), and I always recommend the bun dishes, and also like the eggrolls. Noodles Ranch is a great Vietnamese family restaurant with friendly staff and good healthy food. I warmly recommend it for the quality and the value.",

Here are my recommendations in no particular order: the vegetable egg rolls veggie spring rolls crispy happy pancake- it makes you happy, I swear tofu chow mein or pad thai vietnam basket (this is really big, for like $7 and comes with a bunch of different vegetarian items, such as tofu, broccoli, noodles etc. etc). and for dessert: you must get the warm banana bread pudding.  it's sooooooo good.   Simply put, this restaurant has fantastic food at cheap prices.  Check it out!",

Maybe it's because the location is not prime (strip mall with a Taco Del Mar next door) but for some reason I didn't have high hopes.  The wait staff is a bit quiet/reserved but I prefer to not be bothered by a waiter asking me 50 times if things are ok.  I have ordered the Mango Chicken and the Curry chicken as well as the sampler appetizer.  I'm not proud to admit this but each time I go I practically inhale the entire meal before I realize it.  I also tried their Fusion Ginger Limeade which was very refreshing.",

    "text": "Last Saturday my boyfriend and I discovered the Noodles Ranch (that's what she said!) The Noodles Ranch is located on the Southeast corner of Thomas and Scottsdale Road in the Albertson's shopping center. From the outside it looks much like any other strip mall - hole - in -the -wall restaurant but from he inside it's quite apparent that this restaurant has a lot more character than most.   The decor is what you would expect from a Vietnamese restaurant but with a more modern and upscale twist. The music that was playing while we dined was extremely relaxing and made the experience that much more pleasant. I was even really impressed with the presentation of the food and the dishware. I love the dishes that look (even if they aren't) hand glazed with deep rich blue hues (with all their bubbly imperfections).   The food itself was extremely satisfying as well. Both my boyfriend and I shared an egg roll appetizer (we debated between this and the spring rolls which also sounded quite tempting). The egg rolls came with fresh lettuce (to wrap them in) along with freshly chopped carrots, cucumbers, sprouts, a special sauce with a bit of a tang to it. For the main course we both ordered a bowl of the chicken Pho with broccoli and bok choy. Pure deliciousness. I'm a huge fan of Pho and often go to Saigon Nites up in Scottsdale with my coworkers every couple weeks but I thought Noodles Ranch offered a product that was far superior (especially with the slight twist to such a traditional plate with the addition of bok choy and broccoli). The appetizer wasn't much more than $5.95 and the bowls of soup themselves were about $7-8. An overall very good value for all the food you get. The bowls of Pho were HUGE but I did notice on the menu that you can add more noodles (the restaurant namesake) for $1.00.   I was also feeling a bit under the weather that day and I think Pho was just what I needed to clear out the sinuses. Nothing a bit of chili paste, hoisin sauce, and some steeping jalapeno peppers can't cure!   I will definitely be keeping this place in mind next time I'm in the mood for a quick bite of asian cuisine, and it's so close to my house!",

Waiters walk past me making no eye contact, so I go to the cash register in the back of the restaurant and ask if I need to order first before being seated. The manager says to me that I should wait to be seated as the sign in the front says. He has a menu in his hand and I assume that he is going to seat me. Although the restaurant in 3/4 empty, he tells me to go back up front by the sign and he will seat me. I go back to the front and read the sign which says, \"Thank you for coming.\" He eventually comes to seat me and I point out the sign, which he then replaces with the one, \"Please wait to be seated.\" Normally, I would walk out due to the arrogance of the manager, but I am hungry, tired, and have little time, so I take the seat where I am directed, order. I should have walked out when the waiters ignored me. The chicken cashew lunch special tasted like last week's leftovers. The thinly sliced chicken was so tough that I could barely chew it and the vegetables were frozen mush. We have a lot of choices in Scottsdale to enjoy Vietnamese food; this would be my last choice, and someplace I'll never go into again.",

Veggies brought out were stingy (literally, a single sprig of cilantro on what was to be shared between 2). The beef was overcooked and I could taste it in the otherwise bland broth.   My pho judgment is based on how much I have to doctor up the broth. Maybe it is because I was raised on Southern Vietnamese tastes, but I squeezed 5 or 6 pieces of lime and two spoonfuls of hoison sauce and it still was very \"meh.\" That's relative to the 2 lime pieces and maybe a small squirt of hoison I add at either at home or other Vietnamese spots. Oh, and I also got charged the same price for a small bowl for a regular bowl.  My iced coffee also was pre-brewed. Perhaps another cost saving measure, but it was much heavier on the French coffee side than the condensed milk side.  As my friend put it, this place is for people who just don't know any better about Vietnamese food. There are places far more worth your time.",

It's soy based (or just all soy) so it's pretty salty. The vegetables were steamed and bland bland bland. They used a tiny cup to make the rice shape. Neither of us were full, just barely a step up from being hungry.   Now what knocked the rating down further was that they were completely out of desserts. Our service was terse and brief. Also we were told at the end of our meal that the credit card machine wasn't working and if we had cash. Now after we came in and sat down and waited for service, I thought I heard something about credit cards from the waiter to the other table but I assumed it was something else. That meant the issue already was happening before we ordered but they waited till we were done to say it was cash only??",

I ordered my go-to Chicken Pho, and it was on the table in no time.  I thought it was ok.  I usually jazz-up the Pho with lime, hoisin sauce, cock sauce, and all the other standard accompaniments, but I found myself using a lot more of those items at this place than any other Pho place I've visited.  I even asked for extra limes to get more flavor out of the meal.  That's why I thought the meal was just ok. Too much work on my part to get the taste going, which told me the broth just needed way too much help.  It's all personal preference though.  The service was really good and the staff was very friendly. I know I would never go out of my way to visit here again, as there are other options closer to home that I prefer, but I always appreciate good service and this place had enough of it to possibly make me stop by sometime in the future if I'm in the area and have the craving for Pho.",

The first two visits were not memorable in either a good or bad way.    I suspect there was no adult supervision on my third trip.  The drinks came out quickly and we got our four orders in with a few minutes of being seated.  We ordered 3 lunch specials and a bowl of pho.  Two salads and pot stickers came out for the lunch specials in another 10 minutes along with the herbs/sprouts for the pho.  Salads were OK, pot sticker was cold.  It took flagging down a waiter two more times to get the third salad to arrive.  We are now about 30 minutes into our 1 hour lunch.  After another 10 minutes we track a waiter down to find out about our order he said another 5 minutes.  Later, about 45 minutes after getting seated we go to the counter to find out about the order.  We were then told we were next up, but they could not say how long.  We paid for our drink and ran over to Lo Lo's for a quick piece of chicken instead.  If my first two experiences were a lot better I would try this place again.  It would have been quicker to drive to Tempe and go to Khai Hoan Restaurant, which really deserves the four yelp stars they get.",

We start with the Iced Tea (Jasmine) and Spring Rolls, as usual....they are filled with cold rice noodles, shrimp, pork, fresh mint and lettuce. They are accompanied by a house peanut sauce for dipping. Traditionally, we get this appetizer every single time, without fail, every time they are wonderful.  For entree's we are creatures of habit....I always get Pho with meatballs & tendon....I love all the garnishes they supply: love the fresh mint, cilantro, bean sprouts and fresh lime for a citrusy zing.

Anyway, this shop is right down the street from my house so I thought I would give it a try. The parking lot was a bit crowded but i was still able to park with no problem. The restaurant is very nice on the inside and almost all the tables were full on this Thursday night! It took a few minutes for someone to come and greet us and find us a table, but since they were busy it was completely understandable. I ordered a beef broth pho with no meat. The broth was more sweet than I am used to but it was very good. My boyfriend ordered the chicken pho which also had a sweeter broth but both soups were delicious! I am so glad I found this place and I am excited to go back and try more items!",

Some specific comments on the pho -- The soup base delicious. However, the noodles came in a big lump and eventually broke apart into short sections when I tried to separate them. Most likely the restaurant precooked the noddle to accommodate busy lunch crowd.  Good price range, clean, and comfortable seating. Overall, a great lunch place with friends and colleagues.  Note: Restaurant is not open on Sundays",

But when I feel a restaurant is trying to skim or take short cuts and still charge customers more than other restaurants, it's not fair. Today, I came in for pho...for the last time. The beef was chewy. The broth of the pho should take on the sweetness of the bones. The broth was too brown... maybe too much fish sauce. All I could taste were the artificial flavors. They still do not give enough mint. I did not enjoy the pho at all but did finish because I do not believe in wasting food, especially vietnamese soup.",

Yes it's a bit pricier than what I'm used to paying in Tempe or Downtown Saint Paul (MN) BUT REMEMBER, you are in Scottsdale.   The place is pretty typical when it comes to decor for a Vietnamese restaurant, I like that they have a few extra chairs by the hallway to the bathroom to wait for your take out.   The pho is pretty good, I usually get the combination pho - the ration of sirlon, to tripe and tendon is a little off but nothing to throw a hissy fit about. The noodles as I read in a different review do indeed come in a big lump, but then again I am ordering take out so it's been sitting there for a little before I add to broth - pretty simple solution for me is to throw it in the microwave for 30 seconds. No biggie.",

I understand there are circumstances when a small business must close their doors for a day, i.e. personal reasons, etc.  But, out of courtesy to your normal customers, this information should be at least announced on social media so customers do not drive 30 minutes, only to find a closed sign and a locked door.

If you're not familiar with Vietnamese food, this is a great introduction as there are \"easy\" things on the menu and they serve beer and wine. For those of you that are used to eating pho and weirder things, these guys add extra tendon for me at no extra cost, which makes me drool with happiness!!   Pho is a little pricey for the valley at about $10 for the combo bowl. I am happy to pay though for the convenience, the quality, and the ambience of the restaurant.

It took us at least 10 minutes just to get water. The server started to take the order of a table that had been seated way after us, but we spoke up about it. Even though he stopped & took our order first, the other table still received their food first. The food didn't have much flavor. I had the Chicken Pho & was extremely disappointed after waiting for so long.",

I LOVE pho and was amazingly surprised to find a Vietnamese restaurant near Old Town Scottsdale, not to mention one with very good food. I always find it somewhat humorous when a \"Vietnamese\" restaurant also sells things like Pad Thai and Chow Mein, but my husband seemed to like the Pad Thai a lot, so I'm not one to complain.   I shared the spring rolls with shrimp, pork, veggies, and a side of peanut hoisin sauce with my husband, and they were very refreshing and flavorful, especially the sauce. Despite the fact that it was a \"balmy\" 105 degrees outside, I was in the mood for pho, so I also ordered the Pho Chicken, which was a huge portion. I was so pleasantly surprised to see the broth, the noodles, the chicken, and the fixins' (bean sprouts, chili pepper, Thai basil, jalapenos) packaged separately, to avoid overcooking the chicken and noodles and overall sogginess. I doused my soup in hot chili sauce after adding in all of the ingredients and I must say - it pho was delicious!!!! I was sweating when I was finished, but it was my fault and SO worth it.   I will definitely go back to try some of the other options on the menu. Or maybe to just get another bowl of the pho. I am a creature of habit, after all...",

My girlfriend (who is Vietnamese btw) and I went here for a late dinner a couple of weeks ago, and we were starving.  We started off by ordering drinks and I got my usual Thai Tea; it was completely watered down.  We split the spring rolls and the peanut sauce wasn't great, but that's the norm for most pho places in Arizona.  I got the Pho tai bo vien and something was just off about it.  I've had my fair share of pho, and this was not pho broth.  It was so bad that any amount of adding hoisin sauce or sriracha were not going to fix it.  I had to pay $11 for this...My girlfriend ordered the V1 Bun Saigon - Tom Nuong, thit nuong va cha gio.  She said that the fish sauce was just fish sauce, and that you normally would have something with it to add flavor.  One would think that since the owners are Vietnamese that they would actually know what Vietnamese food would taste like.    Contrary to other reviews, the service that we had was pretty good that night, after the 10 minutes of waiting to even be acknowledged.  That was the one redeeming quality of the restaurant.  The prices were way too high for the terrible quality of the food.  I do not know how in the world they were able to be considered 4 stars.  We may have been better off staying hungry that night.",

Noodles Ranch represents the best of this type of Vietnamese restaurant and I consider it a real find.  Upon entry you can feel that there is a \"lightness\" to the energy here.  Refreshingly quiet, there is no television.  The staff appear to be family and are efficient, professional and peaceful people.    My girlfriend is celiac so this means she not only has to avoid wheat but is also physically sensitive to food quality in general.  Noodles Ranch passes with flying colors for her.

However, the food is below average compared to the usual Vietnamese restaurant.  The pho broth is bland.  Egg rolls and spring rolls aren't bad but aren't fantastic (i.e., average).  The rice dishes and curry noodles dishes are also too bland.  Also, the price is high for Vietnamese ($9 for a bowl of pho?!).  The food quality is a 2-star because it was just too bland for the usual flavorful Vietnamese dishes.  However, the nice service and the cleanliness earn it an extra star.  As other Yelpers suggest, this is probably a good place to introduce people to Vietnamese food, but if you're looking for authentic/flavorful dishes, you should pass.",

This is pretty good if you're looking to share with someone.  I did not get a lot of lettuce and mint, though and ate the last two pieces by themselves.  I was a little disappointed by this.  I had the combination Pho...  (YES i braved SOUP it in HOT ASS ARIZONA) and it was not too bad either.  The broth was nice and clear, just portion wise...  was not as extra large as I expected it to be.  When the bill came, I ended up paying about $18 total which included tax and tip and no drink.  I think the Pho was almost $10.00 and the Spring Rolls were like $4 and some change?  I think this place is cool but would not be my FIRST choice when it comes to pho.  (Trust me...  I've eaten a LOT of pho)  I just don;t think the price vs. portion is worth what you;re paying.  This saddens me to say too because, I am ALL about supporting small Asian businesses.    Oh well...",

He did forget to bring our water even though we asked twice, but I forgave him that when I tasted the refreshing ginger limeade. We shared the veggie spring rolls - so fresh and minty! And we ordered three different bowls of pho. Amazingly flavored broths in the veggie and beef  bowls. I love how fresh the vegetables were and hubby loved the spice in the meatballs. My brother-in-law was a bit unhappy with the thinly sliced tendon but it wasn't on the menu initially and they made it all special for him. Thanks Noodles Ranch for putting up with my crabby brother-in-law by the way. Super tasty and we will definitely be back.",

I have mostly enjoyed the trip, but always had to be careful for the locals providing the wrong change, trying to over charge for the food, and cut corners.  I thought this would be different since I am in America.  I was wrong!  I paid for extra broth and noodles which was $1.50; however, they didn't provide extra noodles or broth.  I saw the order already waiting when I ordered extra food; I thought they would add something to the cup or add an extra cup, but they didn't.  When I got home I was surprised to see how little food there was.  My wife had to add extra ingredients to try to make it filling.    Also I paid $2.00 cash for the extra broth and noodles that cost $1.50 and when I checked the change it was a quarter and a nickel not 2 quarters.  When I called to explain the owner just said \"oh bye-bye\" and hung up the phone.  That is somebody that doesn't care about customers.  How can he run a business?  I can only recommend this restaurant if it doesn't bother you to support people that are dishonest cheaters and cut corners in life.  **As Yelp doesn't let me leave a public review on the owners comment I am also posting a response to his comment here:  I didn't go there earlier this year and leave a $1 tip and say I was pleased as the owner posted in the comment review.  I just moved to Arizona about 1 month ago.    One more time the owner lied and is continuing to act in a dishonest manner.    When time comes only god will be the judge.  If you continue to act dishonestly and not respect customers, you can't stay in business any more.",

The bowls were huge and they brought all the toppings to add to the bowl. The inside of the restaurant was small but they use the space well. For a drink I tried their prickly pear lemonade. It was quite tasty. I get the craving for pho every now and then, and I'll be sure to be back for my next fix.",

    "text": "How is it possible I have not written a review for this place? From the check-ins, tips and uploaded pictures, I could swear I moved a cot into the front space of the restaurant to camp out. It's obvious that Pho/noodle houses are a rarity in Scottsdale. I'm not talking about fancy schmancy because any Asian or noodle lover knows the authentic noodle houses aren't about the pretty packaging. It's what is inside. This gem hands down is consistent good food, good service and a price tag that doesn't dent your wallet just because you live in the most livable city of AZ.   Pho is the perfect warm, hearty meal when you seek comfort. You get abundant fresh veggies consisting of the usual basil and sprouts, fresh homemade noodles and flavorful broth. I will note that even the veggie pho is incredible with the baby bok choy, broccoli, and just add tofu to the order for your protein substitute. My other go to dish is the item V1, grilled pork and shrimp noodle salad bowl. The grilled flavor of the meats scream such goodness. The egg roll and veggies are perfect crunch. With this kind of healthy and taste that doesn't disappoint, I can't imagine picking greasy food over this kind of option. Let's be honest, the only time grease is an option is for those late night outings. Pho is the perfect hangover cure!!  Like any place that offers attentive service and food that never fails to please, you will have a crowd. But the staff is always efficient in cleaning tables and turning it around in time to be out the door to punch in your time clock if needed. I do adore how the entire family and staff take pride in this love nest. They want you to stay and you are never short of a friendly personable greeting by anyone. Why would you eat anywhere else?",

They definitely have one of the best broths if not the best I've tasted in the valley. Saigon Nites, Pho Thanh and Angelina's Pho and grill all are close in the broth category, but I thing this may be the cleanest richest one. The meat is also very fresh, and their meatballs are easily the best. They almost taste homemade and are tender. Usually this is where most bowls of Pho fail easily, with hard nervy meatballs. The drawbacks would be, they overcook their noodles before they put them in the broth, so they fall apart easily. This could easily be fixed. Also the bowl for the large size could be bigger (roomier), allowing the noodles more room, so they don't soften so much from the intense heat. Finally they are stingy with the herbs and you have to ask for the straight fish sauce. So that is why their pho isn't the best, but rather a tie with those other places. For different reasons. Happy pho day!!",

It's a small menu, but everything is well done, and it is probably the only place you can find vegetarian pho with a meatless stock.  If you're looking for cheap Vietnamese, there are definitely cheaper places.  If you're looking for a place that is clean, friendly and good, this is a great choice.

I've been going there for over a year now, at least twice weekly. I always order the crispy egg rolls with fresh greens. Yummy, yummy, yummy! I never seem to get sick and tired of it.   The Pho soups are all delightful and full of flavor. I can honestly say, after eating nearly every item on the menu, you can't go wrong with a majority of the dishes. The Jasmine iced tea is also a winner. Plus, the owners, Andre and Noel, always come by and chat. Noodles Ranch is a winner!",

Andre the owner is wonderful and always a smile for his customers. Maybe we visit too often but I'll wear out my welcome.   The Bun Saigon which I'm having now is a wonderful mix of menu items. Practically, a pupu platter of main dishes. My favorite is the bun no hue which is a spicy noodle soup.  I've had many different versions of the dishes in different cities and the consistency and flavors here are second to none. Light and fresh meals that feel like real comfort foods.   I feel like chef Andre's French cooking training comes through in the flavors. They are not the usual flavors. It's definitely a mix of styles that makes this stand out from the rest. It doesn't go so far that you don't recognize the original foods. The style is very subtle and  original.  Highly recommend trying it if you're new to Vietnamese cooking and feeling adventurous , or if you're a fan that's been looking for a great place to eat. Soft and mellow, or hot and spicy... you won't be disappointed.",

Yes,  I'll admit I was a little apprehensive of their strip mall location; one would think after living in AZ for a while I would know that strip mall restaurants can be good.  This is some of the best Vietnamese I have tried in Arizona! We ordered the spring rolls, which were made with shrimp, pork and just a touch of fresh mint.  I also ordered the Chow fun which was a very hearty portion of wide rice noodles stir fried with chicken and vegetables in a light sauce.  The service was very quick and attentive as well, our server was very nice and suggested my dish.  I will definitely go back to Noodles Ranch again!",

And we then shared a coffee/chocolate creme brulee. I wish we had ordered one for each of us!  This is the first time I've been in a Vietnamese restaurant with good French-influenced desserts, although having been to Saigon I know that it's entirely possible.  I had often passed by Noodles Ranch on my way to LoLo's 2 doors down, had no idea what a fantastic pho cafe it is. Clean room with a spacious contemporary feel, nice young waiter. I thought the pho portion size was just right. Will be back soon now that it's \"winter\". I'm glad I don't have to drive all the way down to Mesa or Chandler for good Vietnamese food!",

One of my friends wanted came for the \"Pho\" which everyone seems to be raving about. I was not in a soup kinda mood so I decided to order the half of sandwich and salad lunch special. The sandwich was just ok, it was grilled chicken on some sort of wheat roll, and some sauce that tasted a little off, the best part of the meal was the cilantro on the sandwich and my salad, whatever kind of dressing they used was delicious. The service was extremely slow good thing we were not in a rush; it appeared as though they weren't prepared for the rush of people that came in for lunch. My friend loved her Pho of course so I decided that the next time I eat here I will have to try this Pho everyone keeps talking about.",

I'm not one of them.  But I HAVE tried Pho noodles in several different settings and we really enjoyed our dinner at Noodles Ranch.  My mother in law was with us and had never tried Pho noodles. She IS pretty finicky with her eating at times. She loved them. She and my wife ordered the Chicken noodles (P5). I ordered the P3 (Sirloin and Brisket) noodles and thoroughly enjoyed it. We had a party of 4 and also ordered some Spring Rolls. They seemed fresh and tasted good as well.  The only minor disappointment was that the toppings plate didn't have cilantro. We got sprouts, basil and jalapenos and apparently parsley instead of cilantro. We love cilantro.  The ambience and inside decor was hands down WAY better than most Viet noodle shops I've been to. Tinted walls and attention to detail. A well maintained and decorated restaurant is likely to be better maintained in the kitchen for cleanliness as well. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys Pho noodles.  It's not PF Changs, but I'd rather support the little guy anyway. The prices were very reasonable as well. Don't hesitate to give it a try. We're going back.",

I guess I'm spoiled living in Orange County where I can get authentic bun bo hue with a lot more spiciness and the right cuts of meat (pork hock, fragrant cha, pig blood curd, etc) instead of the semi-sweet bland broth accompanied with meats that are meant for the pho dac biet. And the wait to get our food for a party of 2 during a weekday lunch was longer than I expected. We ordered bun bo hue and chicken pho. The neighboring table of 3, who ordered after us (banh mi and stir fries), received their food quicker than our 2 bowls of noodle soup. You would think assembling pho and bun bo hue would not take longer than 20-25 minutes. Go figure.   2 stars for cleanliness of restaurant.",

We understand accidents happen, but it's good customer service to offer something to the customer if something like this happens.  Not for this owner!  Her exacts words were, \"accidents  happen.\"  After cleaning off my shoes in the bathroom, I stopped at the counter and shamed the owner for not taking care of her loyal customers for the last 12 years.  I guilted her in to comping our meal.  If I hadn't stopped at the counter, the owner would have let us walk out of the restaurant without offering a meal on the house next time, or offering dry cleaning, and/or apologizing profusely.

    "text": "Every once in a while, the second time is the charm. And fortunately for Noodles Ranch, I am writing a review based on my second visit to this Vietnamese restaurant in South Scottsdale.  The first visit (months ago) was doomed from the beginning. My girlfriend and I were looking for an alternate to Chinese and found Noodles Ranch. We were impressed by the decor and how busy they were. We waited patiently for a table to open up. In the meanwhile, we were never acknowledged or told how long the wait was. It's not that often that I walk out of a restaurant for any reason. Being ignored is one of my pet-peeves.  This past week offered redemption for Noodles Ranch. One of my co-worker foodies suggested Vietnamese. I'm glad he did because I've enjoyed this cuisine before, just not at Noodles Ranch...   The service was better this visit. It wasn't perfect, but that's probably due to the lunch crowd. We were greeted and seated very promptly. The lunch special featured a pot sticker, miso soup (or salad) and a few entree options. The plum and lemon-grass chicken was delicious. Everything was nice and hot and the portion was perfect. Clearly, our meal was cooked to order, so I can forgive the time we waited for the food to arrive. And kudos for providing only chop sticks in the place settings. I am sure they have forks, but those should be by request only.  Seeing how Noodle Ranch redeemed itself, I will be more than happy to visit again for another healthy, delicious meal.",

I've never paid so much for a bowl of pho ($11!!!) before but I guess those prices are allowed considering it's located in Scottsdale, aka the bougie part of Arizona. I mean it's the first time I've ever seen an Asian restaurant charge for hot tea ($2!!!). I'm actually surprised they didn't charge for our water! Luckily the food was not bad at all, otherwise I would've been pissed.  We ordered the pho dac biet (combination pho) and the bun cha gio thit nuong (egg roll and grilled pork vermicelli salad bowl). The pho broth was fragrant and semi-sweet. It certainly is not closed to being the best pho I've had, but not the worst either. It's okay. It tastes very \"clean\" if that even makes sense. The vermicelli salad bowl was nice and refreshing, a great alternative if you are not in the mood for pho. The pork was marinated and grilled to perfection, it had great flavors and was very tasty. The egg roll was not too shabby either, not oily.   Noodles Ranch is fairly modern looking restaurant with bit of a cheesy Asian twist. It definitely caters to the more American crowd as I did not see a single Vietnamese/Chinese customer in sight, so I'm not sure if that makes it any less \"authentic\" (since, you know, you gotta have one to make it so! Haha). The restaurant appears very clean. The workers here are very friendly and hardworking, especially the busboy.  Overall, I think the food here is respectable and actually pretty good. I do, however, think it's a total ripoff.",

    "text": "I ate here Dec 1 with 7 other people in a weekly Thursday Lunch MeetUp, different restaurant every Thursday.  I ordered one of my favorite Asian dishes, beef chow fun.  I was disappointed the quantity was so small and price expensive $9.95.  Not that much beef, compared to other restaurants that charge less.  But in all fairness, other restaurants where I am so happy with the chow fun (e.g., $7.65 for 2 x the portion of Noodles Ranch, at Best Hong Kong Dining in Mesa) and big bowls of pho for $5.25 - $5.99, are not in Scottsdale, they are in Mesa or Westside Phoenix.  My favorite Vietnamese restaurant is Da Vang on 19th Ave, south of Camelback.  I love \"value\", in my food....meaning large portions for low cost, $5.25 for big bowl of pho.      Another Yelper said $11 for a bowl of the combo pho is the most expensive they ever saw.  And others noted the small portions.  I agree.  I would never pay $11 for a bowl of pho, which wasn't even that big of a bowl at Noodles Ranch.  The other people sitting at my table were not so enthralled with their food either, the lady sitting across from me said she \"is not coming back\", her grilled chicken on baguette, was \"terrible\".  Another two people didn't like it either.    I was not that impressed with the service either.  They did not take note who ordered what, and so brought the dishes to our table \"who ordered this\", \"who ordered that\", trying to find a \"taker\" to set the plate in front of.  But we were not sure what our orders looked like to claim it, and some ordered the same thing as others, so food service was not efficient.  It took a long time to for the orders to find their way to the person who ordered it.  I remember one person at our table said they were afraid they were eating someone else's order.  After taking our beverage orders, when they brought the drinks, they did not take note who ordered what, caused more commotion and conversation interruption in all of us at the table trying to find who ordered what, to claim it. I felt the confusion of trying to find who ordered each dish or drink that was brought to the table, was an unnecessary distraction to the camaraderie of a social lunch gathering.  I feel knowing who ordered what entree and drink is the restaurant's responsibility, not the customers.    My chow fun was dry and too salty.  It tasted like it was flavored with soy sauce, only.    The pot sticker looked baked or toasted and dry.    My 2 stars are for small portions, expensive prices, not so good taste,and service with no foresight (can't be bothered to take note who ordered what), compared to other restaurants that do not have those issues.  Also we were sitting there for about 15 min, and no menus.  I actually went up to the counter to \"get them\".   Wouldn't eat here, again, even for free. If the servers were rude, I would have made it one star.  The servers who brought the food to our table seemed to not be able to speak or understand any English and had to summon other staff who did.",

    "text": "Apologies for the lengthy review. There was a bit of epiphany amid description  OK. I tried this place twice. 1st visit. Was with my co-workers. Omar, Jesse & his wife Ann. Omar loves this place. However, he had pho for the 1st time 2 yrs ago. Which was take out- off the 101 & Princess Dr.. To me, that's not a proper intro to pho. Jesse, he's a bit of an epicurean like myself. He ate it, while encouraging us to please try his \"go-to-(pho)-spot\". His wife Ann, was just too dang-on sweet to say anything bad about her experience (she saved that for the car ride home).   We started w/ the greasiest (Cha gio) Crispy Eggrolls i have ever had (...and i LIKE greasy food!). There's not enough lettuce or mint. The cucumbers were Julienne & the Nuoc Mam (fish sauce) was underwhelming. Funny, now that i think about it, It feels like they give the rind of the romaine lettuce. Because there was no leaf to wrap around the roll. If you know cha gio- They're thin. It's not like a fat NY Chinese food egg roll.   **I got it! I bet the reason the romaine is so narrow is because they use the leaf for the fresh spring rolls**  Nonetheless, I couldn't quite put my finger on it but something about the pho i just didn't care for. The company was nice. So, the dining experience was pleasant.   2nd visit. My sister flew in from our home town of San Francisco. She was hungry for some pho & we were near (no other than) Noodles Ranch. I told her where i was taking her. Name alone, gave no indication it was Vietnamese. We sat for lunch. The staff (as before) was kind, attentive & accommodating. She ordered the shrimp pho & I, the classic beef.   As we were adding the veg & herbs to our bowl- she noticed something small & rubbery floating. She took it out and asked the waiter. He said, \"I'm not sure. Maybe a tendon?\" ... A waitress came by and said, \"It's crispy onions\". Now, think about it? The broth is lava hot. Steam fit for a facial. Crispy?   I added my usual amount of Hoisin & Sriracha. Spun my broth & dug into the sweetest broth I HAVE EVER HAD. I tried adding more sriracha, mint, jalapeno, nothing helped. I asked my sister was hers sweet too? She said, \"Yes, it is\" I dipped my spoon into her bowl & it was sweet!   Boy-o-boy, I'm now under the conclusion the Hoisin sauce (in those mystery clear bottles) isn't name brand. It's a knock off substituting as a form of sweetener & lacks that punch of flavor. One that only 'Hoisin' gives.",

The staff was very friendly and would have given 5 stars if our server wasn't so forgetful. He forgot about our drinks and garnishings for the pho twice. The first time I flagged him down for these, then after waiting about 5 min, I walked to the back kitchen area to find him. At least he was apologetic and very nice, so no big deal and I will definitely be going back.",

    "text": "\"Good for Newbies / Whiteboys...Average to the Viets / Foodies\"  Noodles Ranch by name alone, should be a good indicator that they are aiming to attract the culturally timid. All joking aside, I highly doubt that a Vietnamese restaurant with a typical name like; Pho Thanh, Pho 54, Da Vang, Bin Minh, etc. would attract as many newbies or uncultured Americans, which are in great abundance in this metropolis.  With that being said, this is a good place to send your mother, or someone who does not yet have a mind that is developed enough to venture to a place that caters specifically to its originating culture.  I will not give this place a bad rating, as they do a great job, and make people feel welcome. They play their business model very well, and I am happy to see some Viets venture down this road and survive as long as they have in this town. They will bring you a fork and spoon as a standard protocol to keep you from feeling intimidated by chopsticks.  As for the food, again, they tame things down a little bit to cater to a simplified American palette. The prices are a little higher compared to most hole in the wall Pho restaurants, but you have to consider the location and the clientele.   I wouldn't go here and expect to have the best bowl of Pho in town, but would go without a high expectation now that I understand their business model and targeted demographic.  Just as we might hit a lower end hamburger joint, like \"Five Guys\", we are fully aware of the fact that this is not an authentic hamburger, it's a modified and tamed down version to cater to a greater mass of people.  Go support these guys, and don't give them a bad review if you aren't happy with their food. This is a training ground for the simple minded and unadventurous.",

I thought it would be cool to try some AZ pho, but it was easier said than done as there are probably more pho restaurants in one block in Westminster than all of Arizona.   Fortunately we had a good experience at Noodles Ranch (despite the awful name). My pork and eggroll bun was quite good and the pork was well seasoned. The pho broth was also delicious and the bf said they were generous with the meat. The ginger limeade was pretty mild and could have used more of kick.   I had to dock one star because my Viet friends have trained me well that Vietnamese food should be pretty cheap. Compared to LA prices, I think Noodles Ranch is $1.50 to $2 overpriced. But since this is the first good Asian restaurant I've been to in Phoenix, I will happily pay $7.50 to eat pho on a 95 degree day.",

That, like many things, did not follow me out west.  Enter noodles ranch.  This place is small and unassuming located in an Albertson's strip mall, but the food is deserving of a much less humble setting.  Every dish I have had here so far has been dynamite.  Dish are flavorful without being over-sauced and the ingredients always taste nice and fresh.    I have been on a Pho kick pho a number of years now and find it, accompanied by their coconut water (with real bits of coconut so you know its working) , to be the ultimate hangover cure.    Service can get a little backed up during a heavy lunch rush, but the staff is friendly and the food more than makes up for the wait.  Try the P3 add meatballs and bok choy.

This may not be a big deal for most people, but when you live so far away from civilization, like me, this is an impressive feat.    The Service is always good, and often interesting.  I wanted to know if their coconut water was fresh once, and you should've seen the look the server gave me (hilarious!!!).  They must not get that question very often.

My change was $56.90 and they took my copy of the receipt. Okay so they missed a dollar, not a big deal. I let them know I needed a copy of my receipt and that they shorted me $1. Again not a big deal, I understand people make mistakes. These people are straight thieves. They brought me back a receipt for $43.18. I knew and my wife knew how much it was exactly. I even showed them the change of 56.90. If it was 43.18 the change would have been different. They pretended they didn't understand and that they had the right receipt all along. I wasn't going to fight for $1 and I even left a decent tip because I know karma will come back and get them harder than I ever could. Please review your tab and make sure your change is correct. They tried to take advantage of my wife and I because we were busy with the kids. I honestly will never eat there again and I will tell everyone I know to boycott them. It honestly wasn't about the money, shit if they asked I would have gave them the stupid dollar. It was all about their scam that bothered me. I hope other people read this and they are careful when dealing with these scam artist.",

I had the [A1 - Cha Gio - crispy egg rolls ] & [A2 - Goi Cuon Thit Tom - spring rolls] to start.  Oh man was this delicious. The first thing I loved when I walked in was the ambiance. Dim lit and let the sun do the lighting - very zen - if you're into that. I felt very comfortable here.  They had four sauces on the table. I have no idea what they are, but the one with red pepper flakes and oil -- the darker one -- oh wow. If you like heat added to whatever you're doing -- wow -- this stuff is for you! I loved it.   Then I went with the Pho tai - sirloin soup. [P2* - Pho tai] - wow - broth was amazing. Everything was.   For me, enjoying food means I need a few things.   First - awesome food Second - ambiance Third - presentation  They had it all. I was very impressed by place to the plates. Don't change a thing. I hope  your business is very prosperous!",

All sorts of people in and our of the counter area but nobody even greets me for about 7 minutes.  Then some old dude takes my order and says it will be 20 min.  20 MIN.!  A little on the slow end but I said fine.  Went and put gas in car, got a smoke, came back 18 minutes later.  I sit in chair at table directly in front of counter.  Guy that took my order sees me but no acknowledgement.  I wait, and wait, and wait.  Nobody bother to acknowledge me or give me status on wait.  It has now been 35 minutes since my order.  At which time they lost my business.  I step outside, got on phone and called Unphogetabble (which is on my way home) and put order, they say 15 minutes.  Take 12 minute drive and pick up already waiting food.  Go home and enjoy food.  Will never step back in Noodles Ranch.  Nobody should be left not knowing about their waiting, left ungreeted while waiting so long at the front counter.  I hope somebody got to take my food home.  I saw all the great reviews, I guess if you got oodles of time the Noodles is alright.  I'll never know.",

It's definitely a place for people to get food quickly if they don't want to travel too far from their neighborhood.  Every other place that carries these specific dishes, does it better in every possible way. The meat was literally all fat. I LITERALLY HAD HUGE GREY GLOBS OF PURE FAT FLOATING IN MY DISH. ....this place could be enjoyed I must say, but only by a palette of a pig or dog. The woman behind the counter was sly in her comments when I asked about my dish. As if I wouldn't understand she was being sarcastic and rude. When I asked my friend if her being unbelievably rude just really happened, he looked in disbelief and nodded his head.

At the time there weren't many Vietnamese offerings in the Phoenix Metro and the restaurants that were here were mediocre at best.  When I first visited noodles ranch, I was absolutely blown away.  Literally some of the best Vietnamese food I ever had and Vietnamese cuisine is definitely one of my favorites.  I have had Vietnamese fare in very large Vietnamese communities all throughout the US and Canada (Westminster, Chicago, New York, Vancouver, etc), and Noodles Ranch easily ranks up there at the top with these other restaurants.  The pho broth is spiced perfectly and the portion sizes are enough to fill anyone with a hearty appetite.  The bun vermicelli is by far the best in Phoenix.  The banana bread pudding is mind blowing.   In addition to the great food, the proprietors of the restaurant, Noel and Andre are a husband/wife team originally from Saigon.  They are literally the sweetest people you could meet; to use a cliche, salt of the earth.  Andre is a trained chef and before he and his family moved to Phoenix they owned an upscale Euro-Vietnamese fusion restaurant in the Seattle area.  After moving to Phoenix Andre worked as a chef at the Phoenician but decided to venture into proprietorship again and opened a tradition Vietnamese cuisine which is the establishment this revue is about.   I currently live in Chandler, but if I lived in Scottsdale I would dine here every week.   I have pleaded with Andre and Noel to open a location in the East Valley.  One can dream.....",

Excellent food, fresh quality ingredients, great service. I feel great after eating here, not at all sluggish. The spring rolls are amazing, we usually get a few orders. The jasmine iced tea is fantastic. The owners are sweet and passionate about their business, they even have a cookbook out and available for purchase there.",

    "text": "This is my all time favorite Vietnamese restaurant!  The owners are so gracious and have remembered us since they opened, thanks Andre! I have seen it become a huge success with a packed house most nights. They close a bit early in the evenings and are not open on Sundays, but good for them...people need a night off!  I switch off and on from the Mango Chicken, Chicken Veggie Pho, or Mango Shrimp Salad.  The Mango Chicken (my go to dinner) has some coconut milk with a salty delicious thin sauce that I just soak my rice in with crunchy fresh veggies and yummy chicken. The Chicken Veggie Pho broth is so good too. it is huge and I have never in my life eaten the whole bowl in one sitting.  If you get takeout, just realize they separate the chicken/noodles/veggies, and fresh basil, jalapeno, lime, bean sprouts plus combine siracha/plum sauce, as well as the broth. I always get extra lime FYI The Mango Shrimp Salad has a Spicy salad dressing that is sure to have a little fish sauce so you have to be prepared for an authentic salty, spicy, & sweet Vietnamese taste.  My son doesn't deviate from the chicken fried rice, veggie potstickers, or spring rolls. They are all delicious and to this day I have never tasted fried rice like this ever. It is craveable!  I would recommend going to the restaurant before you get takeout. Be patient and enjoy every little extra they put in front of you to make your Pho your own. Much love for this place!",

    "text": "Great place to get your lunch-time pho fix. Ordered the chicken pho and was surprised at how good it was, given that this place seems less traditional than many Vietnamese places I've been to. There seemed to be more noodles than I normally get and the chicken was very good. The meal was plenty for 7.95.  The \"Vietnamese Iced Coffee\" was comparable to that of McDonald's iced coffee and was given to me in a glass. So I had to either continually mix the tastes of coffee and pho or finish it all right before I went back to work, which I did.   My biggest gripes are that pot stickers aren't on the menu and the lack of more than maybe 3-4 smoothie options. I don't think boba was even on the menu. A single pot sticker is available, however, if you get a lunch combo, so I was confused by that. Oh yeah, none of the lunch combos contained pho or any noodle bowl. That seemed strange to me considering the place is called Noodles Ranch and how popular pho is.  But I'll be back one day to get my quick $7.95 pho fix in an area of town that seems to be surprisingly lacking quality Asian cuisine.",

The seating area is relatively small and there's limited atmosphere which goes along with a storefront in a strip mall. A starter of pork summer rolls rounded out a quick dinner. Although the soup was good and filled with white meat chicken and plenty of noodles, the broth could have been a bit richer.  All in all, if you have a craving for this type of food, it's a decent choice.",

My fiancee stayed in Vietnam for 6 weeks and she is in love with Bun Bo Xao, so as soon as she had seen that was on the menu she was sold. Don't let the fact that this place is in a strip mall make you question the legitimacy of this place. Everything we had was very good, and according to her, everything was pretty authentic and what she remembered having in Vietnam. We started with a couple appetizers, she got the veggie springrolls and I got the potato and shrimp pancakes. Both were amazing. I swished my food down with an IPA, which was only 4 bucks - SCORE! My fiancee ordered her Bun Bo Xao and I ordered the Bun Ga xao ca-ri. Both were phenomenal. The flavor of my chicken and the coconut curry was great. My fiancee was mostly quiet as she savored her dish, so I know that she really enjoyed it as well. My next trip I will try something else, probably at the recommendation of the owner as my coworker advised. I am sold on the Noodles Ranch! Hopefully next time its a little cooler in the restaurant, that was my only gripe, and it was a very small one.",

    "text": "This place is a phohead's delight. I order the pho tai chin every single time without fail so that's what this review is focused on. Before coming to Arizona I had a lot of pho options, and they were on mostly on par with each other. Here, it's not even close. Noodles Ranch is king and the others are distant second.   Just as an anecdote, a while ago I stopped by and saw they were closed for holidays. In this timeframe I looked up and tried three of the other pho joints (that I'm aware of) to survive this pho drought.   The one near Scottsdale and McDonald is flavorless and 'thin'. As soon as the heat has even slightly dissipated your taste buds realize there's nothing there. The one at Hayden and Roosevelt is weird, the broth tasted almost like it's been pickled somehow. And the third one, right off Thomas and Hayden, is similarly lacking in flavor, has un-pho like thick slabs of beef, and doesn't have chili oil.   As soon as you taste the broth at Noodles Ranch, it's totally different. It's not 'thin', and the flavor's poppin'. The other places tastes like they either didn't simmer the broth anywhere near long enough, or didn't even use enough spices in the first place. Night and day difference. The tenderness of the noodles is usually pretty consistent. A small, measured amount of chili oil works with the flavor amazingly.   I've ordered the spring rolls and the chicken dumplings as appetizers, they're pretty good. But usually I reserve my appetite for that sizzling pho.   I think 6-8 is the best time. The servers are pretty chill.   Value-wise I think this place is worth it, one of the other joints is cheaper but worse, and two other places are more expensive and worse.    I haven't ordered anything for delivery (taking pho for take out? Take it easy there Marty McFly.)   Music is kind of funky, I'm not sure what genre it is (dreamfunk?) but it's charming.   One more anecdote: a server was momentarily convinced that I ordered bok choy the previous time I was there. So I joke that he was stealthily  upselling me on bok choy with my pho. I decided to order it with the bok choy one time and hey, it wasn't bad.",

Do they charge a service fee when people come to the location and pick up?  Absolutely ridiculous fees.  On top of that, the noodles were so overcooked that they were disintegrating in the box.

My husband had the brisket Pho, and he also enjoyed it but thought there was a seasoning that made it hard for him to eat the entire bowl - but he couldn't place it - maybe cinnamon?  But that way I have enough for lunch tomorrow.  Yum.   We tried the banana coconut bread pudding for dessert. It was just okay flavorful but a bit mushy.    Service was great. The place was clean. However they need to pay a lot more attention to ensure the menus are spotless.   It was my hubby's first visit and we will be back!",

    "text": "We were in the area because we wanted to eat at a nearby restaurant for lunch, but there was a long line that we didn't want to wait in so we decided to come here. We were seated right away and were given menus but it took about 10 minutes or so for the gentlemen there to take our order.   The restaurant is nicely decorated compared to the Vietnamese restaurants I've frequented in Central Phoenix and the vibe seems more relaxed where the employees are nice. The prices are a little on the higher side - not higher based on the average plate price for lunch (around $10), but higher compared to most Vietnamese restaurants.   There were lunch specials highlighted on the menu, but I decided to order off of the regular menu and got the seafood pho which included scallops, shrimp and mussels. Hubby ordered Vietnamese coffee and the Vietnamese sandwich. I enjoyed the pho and hubby enjoyed the sandwich, but the coffee was really strong and it wasn't as sweet as I would like.   Overall, I think it was good, but not sure I would venture out this way specifically for Vietnamese food.",

Extras include green beans, carrots, bok choy, cabbage, broccoli, onions, and more. YUM! Even though just the Pho is MORE than enough food, I can't leave Noodles Ranch without ordering their fresh shrimp and pork Spring Rolls as well. They're honestly the best that i've ever had. The peanut sauce served with them is so dreamy.   Noodles Ranch, you've made me feel so much better during many illnesses and for that, i'm forever grateful! See you again soon {hopefully not to cure an illness}. ;)",

The service is always attentive and Alan (who has been my waiter every time) is more than willing to make recommendations for me.  I've had the following dishes and highly recommend any and all of them:  A2 - Goi Cuon Thit Tom - Spring rolls - the kind that are not fried - I get them with shrimp / no pork and they are delicious and light!  A5 - Banh Xeo - Crispy Happy Pancake - unique flavor - tastes like an egg crepe... great if you are seeking something different!  M4 - Yakisoba mi xao - a tasty yakisoba noodle dish with veggies and your choice of meat  T2 - Bombay Veggies - Wok stir-fried tofu and veggies with curry coconut sauce  B3 - Stir-fried mixed veggies - just a side order but perfect to fill your veggie minimum for the day!  R4 - Thit xao rau xanh - another veggie and rice dish  Basically, you cannot go wrong at Noodles Ranch... I can't wait to get back there soon to try the Pho - it looks pho-nominal!  This is another go-to place in the new hood; just make a mental note - they are closed on Mondays!",

OMG, seriously good Pho.  I recently was able to talk my extremely picky husband to try it.  I got him to try the spring roll.  And he tried a dish with lemongrass and chicken that he was really happy.  Score!   I had the Pho with tofu.  I was very happy (especially because I wasn't feeling all that great and the Pho was so soothing and delicious).  They provided me with copious amounts of lime and mint upon request and I was one happy girl.  I will admit, I've only ever had the spring rolls and Pho, but I've never been disappointed.    The ambiance is surprising, it is in a strip mall.  But you walk in to a really airy and comfortable space.  The decor is unique and fresh.    The staff, other than the owner that ended up helping us, is a little lacking the service skills, but hopefully that will develop with time.  I hope they crack the whip on the sitting on the counters by the register, talking on their cell phones, and the lack of attention (hence the reason the owner took over, I assume).",

However, this place sacrifices efficiency for aesthetics to keep the \"simple\" look. There are a lot of things missing on the table including utensil holders and napkin dispensers and for some reason they have artificial sweeteners on the table?? We ordered 4 bowls of Pho and they only gave us one plate of vegetables. We ended up having to ask for a lot of things \"extra\"  like black pepper, more limes, and more napkins when they should have come standard. Also the servers all seemed kind of confused when we asked for something, so we ended up having to ask them twice. As for the pho, the broth was quite decent yet everything else was lackluster.",

    "text": "This is by far the worst of  Restaurants I've visited.   The food was poor, service was very poor and the manager was rude whom had a very bad attitude.    When I informed the manager that the food and service was difficult to adjust to as a patron he told me that he didn't need to change anything because he gets enough business being in a busy shopping plaza.  He furthered that some people like and some people don't it was not his concern.    The soups had poor quality product which was clearly appearing to farmers aged market goods.  I saw wait staff take things off the table that should have been thrown away and recycle to the next patrons offerings. This would be a good place for a health inspector and a city ghost guest. There was plenty of seating available and the wait was ridiculous and when I said I could take mine to go the manager told me that that would take an additional 25 minutes.  I am concerned about the place meeting appropriate standards for the health department.",

They weren't busy around 5:45pm on a Friday, but the service was a bit slow at times. We had to flag them down to place our order, and I decided to try V6: Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong (Eggroll & Grilled Garlic Pork, $9.75, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OcgiDUS-Mmjl3opnTYzHrQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>). The best part of this dish was the eggroll, which was flavorful and very crispy. The pork was bland and dry, and their fish sauce also didn't have much flavor. However, the vegetables were very fresh, and the noodles were cooked well. Since the Vietnamese food in the Bay Area is awesome, it's a high bar to meet. I wouldn't come back to Noodles Ranch, but it may be the best option out in Arizona. At least parking is easy since there are plenty of spots in this plaza.",

I'd typically round up for good service but in this case that was MEH too. I LOVE pho like I pho-kinlove it (lol)!!! So I've eaten ALOT of it. This place was just okay and over priced for the quality of the food. I ordered veggie pho (cuz I don't eat the meats) and \"crispy\" veggie and little baby had seafood pho.  I \"\" crispy because that was in the title however what I got was far from crispy; matter of fact they reminded me of the 99 Cent store veggie pot stickers like they tasted exactly the same. The 99 Cent store ones aren't bad for a DOLLAR but a penny over that would be too much!!!(strike 1) My veggie pho was 8 bucks and to add tofu it would have been 9-or 10... really? Not that I'm cheap,  but how can veggie cost the same as a bowl one with meat? (strike 2) The very first thing I do when I get my  (usually piping hot bowl of) pho I taste the broth.... welp in this case it was lukewarm like I didn't even need to blow it...(strike 3) the broth was ok... I tasted little baby's (also lukewarm) and they almost tasted the same her's had a very mild seafood flavor. The noodles were fine and my veggies still had a nice bite to them. So overall the soup was fine once I doctored it to my liking... I had to beg for extra lime and still only got two tiny wedges to go with the two they gave us originally... that was annoying but no point deduction...(lol) service was fine...but noting to write home about...",

The restaurant itself isn't remarkable, just standard booths. The food was fairly mediocre. I had the pho ga... it was severely lacking in flavor. I needed to use extra jalapenos and sriracha to get it to taste like anything. My dad had the chow mein, and it was actually much better than the pho... odd since this is a Vietnamese place.

    "text": "Scottsdale used to bill itself decades ago as Western Town USA, or Cowboy Town USA or something like that, to convey a clean, wholesome, western spirit to itself, and bring in tourists to see it's, well, Western-ness.   Not surprisingly, Scottsdale was built, grew, and expanded on old ranch lands, and the names of them are still in the buildings and developments off Scottsdale Road.   McCormick Ranch.... Gainey Ranch..... Noodles Ranch......  Wait a minute Noodles Ranch? Huh?  Have you lost your Noodle?  No, actually, I found it! At Noodles Ranch, off Scottsdale Road!   This Vietnamese restaurant has been here for 6 years, not long after I left the Valley of the Sun in 2004 back to California. If it was here back when i was, I would have been a regular!   Unlike the divey Viet diners of San Jose or Westminster, where decor is dominated by plain tables and standard issue stackable red chairs, and service is by a grumpy old Viet dude who doesn't speak English or smile, Noodles Ranch is perfect for Snotsdale, er Scottsdale.  It has a very pleasant decor of painted walls, tasteful artistic symbols of Vietnam artwork, large red, hanging upside down paper umbrellas,  4 cooling ceiling fans, a decorated cashier counter in front of the kitchen, and better quality table and chairs than their Little Saigon counterparts.   Scottsdale prefers looks  over substance, so it likes nice decor in favor of good food, as exampled by the many large, formula restaurants with million dollar decors but mediocre food. And remember, PF Chang's, that popular faux Chinese chain, the epitome of Decor upstaging Taste, was started right here in the Valley  of the Sun.   So seeing the tasteful decor, and seeing all the non-Vietnamese in the restaurant, kept my expectations very low on the food taste-o-meter.   But I was pleasantly surprised!   Now I lost count, but this is close to the 100th different Vietnamese restaurant i have eaten in all over the country in the past 4 years!  (see my Wanugee! lists for Pho and Vietnamese for details.) So I have tasted good and bad and everything in between. And granted, I was starving from not eating all day, and here it is 7:00pm.   But when I ordered Cha Gio (egg rolls), the 6 little crispy rolls came out beautifully plated on a large, quality made and decorative platter, and unlike most orders for this in those dives, which usually come out on a plain little white saucer plate by themselves, here, they were accompanied by several large leaves of romaine lettuce, pickled and julienned slices of cucumber and carrots, sprouts, basil leaves, cilantro and of course Nuoc Mam (fish sauce) to dip them.   Now most of the customers in here at the time would have dipped the rolls into the sauce, and probably poured the leftover sauce over the veggies, mixed them, and eaten them like a salad. If this were PF Changs, that is what they probably would suggest.   But I took the leafy lettuce, put an egg roll on top of it, and sampled the veggie ingredients on top of that, rolled up the lettuce, and dipped all of that fresh tasty goodness into the Nuoc Mam. This is much like how you might eat many other Vietnamese dishes in a Vietnamese restaurant, be it Nem Nuong, Banh Xeo, or even parts of Bo Bay Mon.   So I was impressed and happy with the refreshing mix of fresh veggies, crispy rolls and tasty fish sauce exploding into my mouth! Loved it!  So I figured that was for show, however, to impress the Low Fan (outsiders) with a $5.95 fancy appetizer, with Scottsdale pizzazz.   Mais, au contraire mon frere!   The Pho Tai Nam ($7.50) I ordered was very good! I always try the broth first, and this broth had a very rich, complex flavor! Perhaps a little sweet for the Low Fan, but very beefy, savory, and not too mucked up with masking ingredients to distract from the True flavor. The meat pieces were whole and higher quality than most I have had, with good tenderness. I had to ask for the separate condiment dish, where I mix the half Hoisin and half Sriracha, to dip my meat into, so as not to destroy the flavor of the broth.   I was smiling after this meal! I even called up my Viet friend in San Jose, who could tell I was smiling over the phone, which they usually only notice after I have had good, authentic Japanese sushi or tasty and cheap KBBQ!  I would recommend this place highly! It is a little more expensive than those $5.50 bowl dives on the coast, but the decor and quality of food, and the service from the owner, all combine to make a quality experience.   They offer all the usual Viet diner foods, like Goi Du Du, Goi Cuon, Mi, Com, Bun, Bun Bo Hue, etc. They also offer two of my faves I will have to try another time, Banh Xeo (crispy pancake) and Canh Chua (sweet-sour lemongrass soup).    So this is perfect for Scottsdale, with the nice decor, but with the added bonus of tasty, quality food! They even play smooth jazz, something you would find in another Scottsdale staple - the SPA!",

    "text": "A friend/co-worker had been trying to talk me into going to Noodle Ranch for months.  Especially since I had gotten pregnant and had experienced a few weeks worth of morning (all day long) sickness.  Well this past Friday, she finally twisted my arm enough into going.    I've had Pho at a lot of different restaurants.  I've had Pho so much so, that I got burnt out on it a few years back.  Hence, my reason for not really wanting to check this place out.  You've had one Pho, you've had'em all.    We both ordered the Pho ga ca rau xanh (Pho chicken, broccoli, and baby bok-choy)  The noodles were about par for pho noodles.  The broth was as standard as any pho broth.  There was hardly any broccoli and baby bok.  You're paying .75 extra for broccoli and bok, so I expect to see quite a bit in my pho.  Also, they only brought out 1 small plate (about the side of a bread plate) for the two of us to split of the bean sprouts, lime, chili pepper, and thai basil.    You'd think if both of us are ordering pho, we'd BOTH get a plate.  I will say though, the bowl was huge.  After having a few spoonfuls of the broth and bites of noodles, I ended up just eating the broccoli, bok, and most of the chicken.  We split an order of the spicy pork vietnamese springrolls.   Now, those were awesome!  The rolls were nice and stuffed.  The dipping sauce that they come with, spicy and slightly sweet.  Throw some chili paste on them and they're perfect!  If I had known that the pho would have been such a disappointment to me, I would have ordered the springrolls as my entree.    Will I return?  I think so.  But just to get an order of the spicy pork springrolls.  :)",

The menu is enormous, my favorites being the spring rolls in peanut sauce, the Bun bo xao which is beef stir fry in vermicelli noodles and the combination Pho soup. All the drinks are good, including the Jasmine iced tea, the Ginger limeade and the Vietnemese iced coffee.

The waiter agreed it was pork and the owner said it was beef. I know what pork looks like and tastes like...then I was accused of not wanting to pay for a meal I did not eat. I have been coming here since they opened and have an autograph cook book from the owner. I ask you why would I want this relationship to end? Poor customer service and misguided accusations just lost them a great customer that has introduced quite q few people over the years. It is still a good place to eat, I will never enter those doors again as a result of the owners wife's handling of the situation. Unfortunate situation for both of us really.",

Noodles Ranch is located in the Bashas complex on Thomas and Scottsdale Rd. next to LoLo's! Twofer! I am so glad I can come to one place to get my foodie on hardcore.   Upon walking up, nothing much to see, there are basic booths and tables with a casual Eastern theme going on. We sat in a booth and the owner said hello upon recognizing my friend from his innumerable visits there. I looked at the menu and gawked at the prices that are easy on the wallet... I then asked my buddy what he recommends. I like everything Vietnamese, so it's a tough call for me to choose. I was in the mood for a veggie dish of some sort. He said the Goi Ga was fantastic-- a cool, zesty chicken salad: shredded white meat with cabbage, carrot, mint, chopped peanut and chili lime dressing. I couldn't even look at anything else. Done. Ordered. My buddy ordered the Bun Thet Nuong: Grilled garlic pork and vermicelli along with veggies. They both arrived quickly. I could eat this salad every day. There is nothing wrong with it, it is c'est magnifique! Perfect combination of peanut and light citrus with fresh greens and plenty of chicken. The Bun was juicy and tender and rich in flavor. I wish I could order five dishes at one time here, but that seemed excessive.    I am excited to continue coming here for the prices, flavors and service! I hope it continues to flourish!",

I'd go back just because it's on the few vietnamese joints close by where i'm staying.  *edit* I went there the next day, and instead of packing up my leftovers to go like I asked, the waitress threw it away. Knowing this had happened already, the waitress still kept the extra rice I ordered to go (to eat with my leftovers) in the check. I was definitely irritated that they didn't at least offer to replace what they threw away or at least just taken out the extra rice I ordered immediately. I don't know if I'd come back again.",

The food is fresh. Its not that greasy/sweet americanized flavor.  I had the Pho Tai which had a surprising kick to it, and I tried some of my dad's chow fun noodles which were amazing.

Granted, when I went with a lunch friend, we soon realized their A/C was out. Ouch. It was steamy inside, so we asked for our lunch orders to go. A few minutes took longer than a few minutes, but we waited patiently. The server was friendly and professional; he even apologized more than once about their busted A/C.   I ordered off the lunch menu. $7.50 for a pot sticker, salad and main entree (the spinach salad with spicy chicken.). Most of my entree was spinach (just an observation). The chicken was very tasty and there was a few tomatoes included.   The pot sticker was good, though a bit too greasy for my likes.   I think if I ever came back here, I'd have to try the pho. I feel it's unfair to judge a Vietnamese Noodle restaurant without trying their noodles, especially the signature pho bowl. Next time I go, though, I hope they have A/C!",

    "text": "Located in a small strip mall anchored by a grocery store and a blockbuster, and sandwiched between a water&ice and a beauty supply store and a dry cleaner... this little restaurant is a fresh surprise. If someone blindfolded you and took you here, you wouldn't know you were in a strip mall. The decor is slightly hodge-podge, but a lot nicer than you would expect.  I've been here about half a dozen times and have yet to be disappointed. While it's not my favorite Pho, this place is quite good. They are very accommodating and will pretty much make the dishes however you like. The service is really good - but if it's busy, you may have to exercise a little patience.  I love the egg rolls and the spring rolls were tasty as well. Other Pho places I've been call the fried ones Spring rolls and the non-fried ones Summer rolls, but this place calls the non-fried ones spring rolls. Whatever, just get their sampler platter and enjoy...  There's not much to complain about - it's close, it's clean, good service, and the food is good. I can't explain why I have only been there a handful of times since I've lived about two blocks away from this location since forever. This place doesn't quite make the 5 star mark because I've had slightly better Vietnamese food and because it's located in a spot that should be a Mailboxes Etc. This place deserves a spot among finer dining in downtown Scottsdale... instead it's next to a Subway.  Don't let that stop you - this place is great.",

The pho is a good choice if you are sick, you are not starving, or you count calories.  I usually order one of the pork items when not relying on the pho.  Our Vietnamese friend orders in a language with limited phonemes and the rest of us order by the easy to use Menu ID system.  We've tried several Vietnamese places in the city and this is the best we've found.  It gets a little busy at lunch, so come early or be prepared for a little wait.",

I am starting to be of the opinion I need to start bringing my own limes into places since this seems to be a recurring theme.

I have eaten the Ban Mi (vietnamese sandwich) here in the afternoon a couple of times and it is tasty enough and I was craving Pho and didn't want to drive across town to Maxim.   We started with the veggie spring rolls. They were tasty and very clean with a nice minty flavor. Very decent portion. We both got the Pho tai (sirloin) which was good but not great. First time I've ever eaten Pho where there is more meat in proportion to noodles. The broth is decent but not great, the noodles are the same. Overall a very decent Pho spot that I would come back to since it's around the corner from my house.   Biggest issue is that after the apps, the two bowls of pho, and two ginger limeades (very tasty), and tip I was 40 bucks lighter. Way too much money for Pho, and the service wasn't impeccable either...",

They have many other dishes besides this prized Vietnamese dish, but why pass up on a specialty?  Their choices within the pho category were smaller than most places I've been to but every choice is primed with great ingredients.  My favorite one so far...chicken, broccoli and baby bok choy, never found such a combination elsewhere and I search for it constantly.  I must say that the seafood pho has much to be desired as the mussels are either over or undercooked and wash out the delicate broth flavor.  If you end up with a sweet tooth afterward, try the 3-color dessert, it's something to say you've had at least once with sweet beans and green gelatin coated in sweetened milk and ice.  It's delicious and enough for two to share.",

I seriously must get take out from here at least once a week.  The Chicken Pho is still scrumptious and delightful and I crave it quite often.  The staff is so friendly too!  Noodles Ranch is a gem in the desert so stop by and try them soon.",

I also ordered spring rolls and egg rolls. They were were ok. I felt like they were lacking in flavor and the sauces didn't really make much of a difference. Also ordered papaya salad, it was nothing like what I'm used to eating back home and I've pretty much given up trying to find good papaya salad in AZ. I got teriyaki chicken with rice for my son. It was pretty basic, my son didn't rave over it like he usually does. The service I did receive at the counter was pretty good though and they did pay attention to detail. I requested they put the peanut sauce in separately since my son is allergic. They put it in a small bag for me. I can't say much for the waiters since no one greeted me or even approached us when we entered.",

There wasn't anything wrong with the food but it also didn't leave a lasting impression either.   Let's go over the goods first. Friendly and fast service, clean restaurant, and good menu options. My biggest critique is that the pho did not have great flavor. The portion was pretty generous but it doesn't really matter if it's not that enjoyable. Prices are also a little high so the value isn't really there either.   Overall, I would suggest to pass on this place unless you absolutely do not want to drive a few miles for better Viet options.",

I have had, with success, spring rolls, dumplings, salad rolls, and the bread pudding (which was good twice, eh once). I am like Pavlov's dogs, though, I got the good stuff once and I will keep coming back in the hopes it will be there again, becasue GENERALLY this place rocks.",

    "text": "Last day of my vacation, so I figured that I may as well treat myself to a delicious dinner! Off to Noodles Ranch!    I started with the cha gio (A1 - crispy eggrolls), as per usual here. Minced chicken and veggies in a light wrapper, served with lettuce, thai basil, cilantro, bean sprouts, pickled carrots and cucumbers and a dipping sauce.   I decided to mix things up for my entree. Normally I get the ga xao xa ot (R1 - lemongrass chicken rice plate), but today I went with the bun ga xao xa ot (V5 - noodle salad bowl). Wok stir-fried chili lemongrass chicken, vermicelli rice noodles, cucumber, lettuce, carrot, bean sprout, basil and mint.   Finished it all off with their \"Phoenix chocolate\" desert. Warm chocolate lava cake baked in-house and topped with vanilla ice cream. Not a traditional lava cake in that the center of the cake is molten, but it is very moist and the berry sauce that they put on it is very nice as well.   I did also try their ginger infused limeade. It's very good, but you really can't beat their jasmine iced tea. Honestly is the best I've ever had. Very clean, floral taste and the clarity is superb.  That covers the food.  As for the establishment itself, and the folks who run it, both are beyond reproach.  The restaurant is always very, very clean and organized - all the way back to the unisex bathroom, which is also supremely clean and well kept.  The ambiance during lunch and dinner is always very comforting and relaxing.    The owners and their staff are very warm, kind, polite and very approachable.  They are always happy to strike up a conversation and take very good care of all their patrons.   If you haven't tried them, do so.  This is my absolute favorite place to eat in the valley.",

This year, we ate here twice in our first 3 days because the owners were going on their annual vacation and we didn't want to miss out on their fabulous food. The food is incredible--vegetable rolls, pho, lemon grass chicken, etc., etc. The service is great. And the wife-husband owners are extremely friendly, accommodating, and professional. This continues to be one of our very favorite restaurants anywhere!",

I can't say I'm a total expert on pho or Vietnamese cuisine, but I've always really loved what I've ordered here.  I find myself ordering the Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong (v6) most often -- the garlic pork is yummy and the spring rolls are nice and crispy. I crave it all the time.  I haven't had their pho in a few years actually, but my friends all say it's yummy.  Interior is nice, service could be a little better, but all in all I love Noodles Ranch.",

The prices aren't bad and the service, although laid back and sometimes slow, is always accommodating and tries to get to you as quickly as possible. I've even had several occasions when I've been on a tight schedule during lunch break and we'll call while we're driving over (6 minute drive) and they'll have our table and food ready for us when we arrive!!!!

The dining room is very nicely decorated with a soft lighting that makes it very comfortable. The owner comes out to visit every table and makes sure you have enough water and to see how you like the food. Service is very, very good.  We only ordered three dishes so we can only rate the food on those. The Spicy Pork Spring Roll special had tender grilled pork however it was not at all spicy and the sweet dipping sauce was just too sweet without enough tartness.  The bun tit nuong cha goi (vermicelli noodles with garlic pork and crispy egg rolls) is basically the go to dish at an authentic Vietnamese place and this one hit on two and missed on two points - the meat was tender but did not have enough flavor or char notes and it was a small portion of meat as well. The second hit was the crispy egg rolls - very tasty and very crispy but there was no appropriate sauce for dipping. That was the second miss - the nuoc cham dipping sauce served with it - it was so watery! A good nuoc cham will be somewhat strong and have noticeable lime, garlic, fish sauce, sweetness and hot chili flavors in a well balanced mix. This one tasted a tiny bit sweet, with a hint of garlic and barely any lime or fish sauce notes - it was just too bland. The only offer sriracha and a hoisin like sauce on the table - no fried shallots, rushed red peppers or pepper oil as they do in Vietnam.  The only side veg they offer are green beans on garlic black bean sauce. These were really tasty with a nice coating of the sauce and topped with crispy fried shallots,  Perhaps we should the pho next time as the bun (vermicelli) noodles are just too boring.",

The first time I had a banh mi with salad,  a lunch special.  It was good and  priced at $7.99, no bargain but doable.  The second time I went I had pho from  the menu,  with slices of beef. It was hugely disappointing.  The broth was weak and almost tasteless.  On top of the vapid quality of the broth, it was expensive at over $10.00. I've been to tons of Vietnamese restaurants in different parts of the world, and this place had one of the worst and most expensive  pho broths ever,  The quality of a Vietnamese restaurant's pho is a benchmark of the overall quality of the restaurant; therefore, two stars is all I can give to this restaurant.    Do yourself a favor and go to  more authentic Vietnamese restaurants.  They might not be quite as attractive, but they'll spend more money on the food,and make things taste right.",

The pho had no beef broth flavor, it tasted like meat and noodles... We ordered com thit nuong and it was not good. The nuoc mam looked like dirty fish sauce...tasted terrible.

    "text": "It was Asian weekend at my house last week...not a taco in sight.  There's a first for everything.   We opted to have dinner at Noodles Ranch and dine in.  The restaurant was busy on a Saturday night, but we were seated quickly.    That was the only thing quick about the experience.  Actually, our orders were also taken quickly, but service went downhill from there.  Our spring rolls arrived, and I had to ask for napkins as there were no utensils on the table.  The food runner almost looked confused and brought over a few pathetic scraps of paper usually found in a dispenser.  So I was off on a rant over that...especially when I looked down and saw a full-sized sucker on the floor.  I guess we weren't worthy.  Food took forever, but when it finally arrived we realized again we had no utensils.  My husband spotted some chopsticks and took matters into his own hands to retrieve them.  No one ever came by to check if we needed anything, and my husband who by now should have put an apron on, found soy sauce for me.  The check arrived slowly and without an offer of dessert.    Why four stars you ask?  Because I really did enjoy the food.  The spring rolls were okay, but our entrees were great.  My husband ordered a special of noodles and yellow curry with chicken.  The curry was spicy and flavorful.  I was sort of jealous.  I had the Yakisoba with seafood. They skimped on the shrimp, but there was plenty of chicken and pork (the pork was my favorite anyway) and lots of veggies.    Will definitely return, but maybe only for take-out.  If we dare eat in again, I hope the service is better...don't make me strip another star off of my review!",

We were starving too, so a little bothered. The springrolls were just OK. The rice paper was a bit dry, but I did love the peanut sauce. That was fabulous! I got the Happy Pancake as my meal and still, not impressed. The pork was a little rubbery and the meal overall was fairly bland. The dipping sauce almost seemed pointless. I started using the leftover peanut sauce to make it more tasty. Meh. Staff was friendly and apologetic, but it wasn't enough to overcome the boring food.  I think I am just in love with Pho Avina's in Glendale. It has tainted all Vietnamese restaurants for me. That place is bomb. Sorry guys!",

    "text": "As far as Vietnamese food is concerned, this is by far the best that we've found in the Phoenix area.  We've tried a few different dishes, all of which were great, but judging by the quality of what we've gotten, it seems to be the kind of place where one could safely order just about anything on the menu and not be disappointed.    Our favorite items are the veggie spring rolls and the vegetarian Pho with tofu.  The spring rolls are made of tofu, cucumber, bean sprouts, and mint wrapped in rice paper.  The ingredients are so fresh and delicious and there's just the right amount of mint to add the necessary flavor to set these veggie spring rolls apart from so many others.  They're served with a peanut hoisin sauce and we like to add a bit of the red chili sauce to it to give it a bit of spice. The Pho (item P7 on the menu) is so flavorful and in addition to the rice noodles, has baby bok choy and broccoli in it.  It's served with a plate of bean sprouts, thai basil, cilantro, jalepenos, and lime and is some of the best Pho that we've ever had.    It's certainly telling that the restaurant is busy even when we go for a late lunch at 2pm.  If you're looking for excellent Vietnamese food, this is definitely a place that you shouldn't miss!",

Not that we have anything against strip malls but we usually go there to shop - or grab a quick bite. Don't be fooled by the N Scottsdale Rd folks, this ain't Scottsdale fine cuisine material.    We went for Saturday lunch and while we could hardly find a parking spot, the restaurant was half full. Reception at the entrance is sluggish, no eye contact, no welcome. We just stood there for a few minutes and eventually we were shown a table. Very casual setting, nothing authentic. We sat and were given menus. Andre came and took our orders. No problem there.   Now on with the food.  Portions are small... and at first we were thinking \"quality over quantity\" but this wasn't the case. In general, the food was ordinary at best, way too sweet. My wife is Vietnamese and she did not appreciate her pho at all. My papaya salad had fish sauce in it and I could not eat it. Cyclo's papaya is FAR FAR better. My son liked the egg rolls. At first my daughter liked the sweet potato fries but eventually she bailed out. They were cold and dry.   The restaurant is clean and overall the service is adequate. But the food isn't compelling enough for us to return.",

My girlfriend and I ordered take out from here last Friday night. Ordering from Noodles Ranch is great. The menu (which is easy to find online) has a simple letter and number code. I know this may sound uncultured, but since I cannot pronounce the names of most Vietnamese foods, I like this.   We had the A7-Grilled Salmon Salad Rolls. Fantastic. The Tamarind dipping sauce was a little too hot for my girlfriend, but perfect for me.  We also ordered the M2-Pho lon xao / Chow Fun (with chicken) and M1-Mi xao / Chow Mein (with chicken). Both meals were good, very similar, just differently prepared noodles.   I do feel a little guilty about only three stars. The food is really good, not priced too bad, but it's not all that filling. Even after finishing a starter and our meals, I still had a craving for something more (guess we should've ordered a dessert). The wait for the food was also pretty long. We were told on the phone that it take about a half hour. We arrived a little less than 30 minutes later, and still waited in the restaurant for a good 10 minutes. The staff was very accommodating, and let us sit at a table while waiting, and apologized many times for the wait. I really want to try this place again, maybe the dine-in experience will up it to four stars.",

I just had my second take out lunch from NR yesterday, a huge order of Pho (P7 with broccoli and bok choy, $1 extra for tofu) that I wasn't even able to finish.   When you order take out the Pho comes in a styrofoam cup, the sprouts, jalapeno, basil, siracha and lime are in a baggy, and the noodles and tofu are in the takeout box. I had to separate about half of the broth out of the cup because it was filled to the brim and there was no room for the other goodies. Then I went to work adding all my treats and created a massive pho that was just spicy enough with the little cup of siracha. No I will say that the siracha has some brown sauce mixed in, like soy sauce or something with high sugar (fish sauce?). I wasn't wild about the sweetness that lingered because of that.   What more can I say? It filled and warmed my belly, burned my esophagus and staved off my 'i haven't eaten lately' crankiness.",

So far I've had the summer rolls, the spring rolls, banh xeo and the bun cha ha noi, and they've all been pretty tasty. The owner is also really nice and went out of his way to recommend some vietnamese markets in the Phoenix area. Can I find cheaper and perhaps better tasting vietnamese food further out in Phoenix? Possibly, but for the convenience, the quality of the food and the service, I'll be back at Noodles Ranch.",

Attentive service and good value but average quality food.  The stir fry vegetables were hot and tasty but I was not impressed with the texture of the chicken.  I would have preferred all white meat.  Next time I get a foot massage I will try ordering from the menu.  On my visit there there were  quite a few patrons who seemed to know what they wanted.

But if you're craving general Asian flavors and don't mind a touch of grease in your food, then Noodles Ranch may do in a pinch.  The banh xeo (Vietnamese crepe) came across more thin omelet than crisp crepe.  While the filling of pork and shrimp were quite generous, the flavors were much more Chinese than Vietnamese.  The catfish dish tasted pan fried (with a generous splash of oil) despite the menu description of \"grilled.\"  Heavy use of turmeric also made it taste vaguely Indian.  Overall, not a bad pan-Asian food place, but the flavors just didn't fulfill my craving for Vietnamese.  Next time, I'll take the drive to Da Vang.",

    "text": "Nearly half a decade ago, a man's fantasy became reality in a form never seen before: Scottsdale, Arizona. The motivation for overhauling the city's master plan was to create the greatest feast for the senses in the American Southwest. Everyday, reputations are on the line as master chefs pit their artistic creations against each other.  If my memory serves me correctly, and I think it does, the French first colonized Indochine in hopes of seeking access to rubber. And the greatest beneficiary of this decision would be the brothers Andre and Edouard Michelin, inventors of the world's first removable pneumatic tire. To encourage automobile sales, and by extension, their tires, the Michelin Company begin to print free travel guides at the turn of the century with recommendations and ratings systems for restaurants, hotels, and attractions throughout France. These ratings are still the most influential culinary grades in the Western world. It should come as no surprise that as controversy about the Michelin system has grown, Vietnamese cuisine has finally seen the rubber hit the road.  A recent addition to Scottsdale's culinary universe is Andre Nguyen. Having migrated to America near the end of Republican Vietnam. Arriving in Seattle, Nguyen attended culinary school and met his wife, Noel. But despite the lure of of other cuisines, the chef stayed True to his roots and opened Andre's Eurasian Bistro in the suburb of Bellevue. His success was almost derailed by a fire that gutted the place. Ngyuen however used the time as a sabbatical, improving his craft, and re-opened his restaurant. Local journalists likened it to the Greek mythological creature of rebirth , the phoenix.  But as luck would have it, he and his wife sought out to leave soggy Seattle for arid Arizona for a different Phoenix. At the end of 2005, they took over a hole-in-the-wall called Pho AZ and named it \"Noodles Ranch\". Here today, Chef Andre rules the roost with impressive skill.  The interior decor flatters the otherwise mundane feel of the strip mall in which it sits. Andre has been careful to use color and light to accent various pictures, newspaper clippings and other decorations. But what will surprise the visitor is the degree in which Andre takes this so seriously as to neglect not even the bathroom from this regime.  His menu is a mix of predictable, authentic Vietnamese dishes and his own creations borrowed from other cuisines or his own imagination. Chef Andre is not a reckless auteur, but his more audacious dishes may have fewer fans than his bread and butter.   As the Chef takes many of the orders personally, guests often might assume the service to be poor, undercut by Andre's own seemingly curt personality. But this ignores the fact that in authentic Asian restaurants, servers often seem more distant and unpleasant than Denny's. Do not let Andre's intent become lost in translation.  Finally, in standing with his other bretheren, the Chef achieves this all with low prices. Now Chef Andre, \"the Giant\", after years of success in the land of gray skies face your greatest challenge yet. Hold your own against the city's most eminent gourmands, not just for you but for the good of all Scottsdale.",

I am not one of those that judges Vietnamese spots by the Pho alone.  I've ordered their Pho and i've enjoyed, but there is much more on the menu to try.  The Thai Tea could be a bit sweeter/richer -- but maybe it's a good thing not to guzzle down liquid sugar.

I am not insinuating this place isn't, but I don't like my food to be slightly \"watered down\" so the masses can enjoy.  Unfortunately Noodles Ranch ever so slightly muted out what wonderful flavors Vietnam has to offer for what I believe, is pleasing the \"Scottsdale\" crowd.  This is how I came up with that conclusion: 1. there egg rolls and fish sauce, 2. the place was way too clean for a Vietnamese restaurant, and 3. I was the only Asian patron.  Like your typical Vietnamese style egg rolls, it came out nice and warm with that crispy skin you expect, unfortunately I thought the filling was a little on the bland side.  Also, I thought it was slightly oily for a fried egg roll.  A paper towel would have taken care of that.  But it needed some help with a little more salt and pepper.  No bold flavors coming out from there.  It came with your standard lettuce, a few herbs, julienne pickled carrots, and a few raw bean sprouts.  They were all fresh as they should be, but it was the fish sauce that started to get me thinking they might be \"watering down\" the food.  I don't know about you, but I'm used to slightly salty, slightly sweet, sour/tangy, fishy fish sauce with pepper flakes and julienne sweet and sour pickled carrots and dikon.  Their version was saltier than usual, did not have the pepper flakes and julienne pickled carrots.  The sauce wasn't very fishy either.  Very bland, almost catering towards the Scottsdale people in the area.  The Pho, was status quo.  Nice and warm beef broth with all the goodies such as sliced beef tenderloin, Vietnamese style meatballs, tripe, and other goodies, totally hits the spot on a rainy AZ winter day.   The noodles were roughly 5 minutes overcooked.  They broke apart too easily and I wish they would have given just a little bit more of the sliced beef tenderloin.  One of the owners did ask me if I wanted more soup even before I started which was a nice gesture, I just wish they would have given me more up front.  The middle aged couple who owned the restaurant were extremely nice and the service was great, especially for a Vietnamese restaurant.  The decor was very tasteful, bright colorful Vietnamese umbrellas dressed the ceiling.  I was impressed by the openness of the restaurant with its high ceilings.  The walls were attractively dressed with dark purple and muted blue with large black and white photos of old Vietnam, probably mid 20th Century, with an assortment of bamboo sticks and other trinkets from the \"old country.\"  The only thing I couldn't't get over were the booths which lined the side walls of the restaurant with stripes of this sparkly, metallicy electric blue and sandy tan color that dressed the booths.    I must say that I enjoyed the fact that the restaurant was so clean.  Unfortunately when it comes to Vietnamese restaurants, it seems the dirtier and dingier the restaurant, the better the food.  For Vietnamese food , it was priced high, probably anywhere from $1.00 to $1.50 higher per dish.  That probably has more to do with reflection of rent than anything else.  Last thing why I believed this place was a little \"watered down\"; I was the only Asian patron during their lunch rush.  As many of my friends have said (White, Black, and Brown), \"You know how I know what Asian restaurants are good...The ones with all you Asians in it.\"   Enough said my brothas from different mothas.  I'm not saying I won't come back here, because I will, but when I want the real thing, you know where I'm going, where my Asian peoples are at...my dirty dingy Khai Hong in Tempe.",

    "text": "The Pho is pretty tasty and so are the spring rolls. I have to say that everything was pretty good for a pho place in scottsdale. The prices are a lot higher than I am used to at almost double what I normally spend on Pho but I guess its just Scottsdale for ya.   I would go here on days where I don't have time on my breaks to make it over to my usual spot. Just have to save up for the week to do so though. Or maybe if someone else pays lol. I fly you buy?",

    "text": "I love good Pho, and Noodles Ranch didn't disappoint.  After a nice and relaxing foot massage at Just Relax, which is just 2 door down, my girls and I were hungry.  LoLo's had a line out the door, so we decided to try out Noodles Ranch.  I'm glad we did!  Our first impression of the restaurant is that its clean and has nice decor.  That's always a good start.  We each ordered the ginger limeade, which was so refreshing and yummy!  We had the shrimp spring rolls (minus the pork), and they were very good -- comparable with other pho joints in the Valley.  I ordered the seafood Pho, which comes with shrimp, mussels, calamari and scallops.  The broth was delicious!  There was only one scallop, which was disappointing.  The two mussels were gynormous, and not in a good way.  I love mussels, but I don't like those giant mussels, it just grosses me out.  So I ate one of them, but left the other.  All in all, it was a good experience.  I'm not in Scottsdale often, but would definitely come here again if I'm in the area.",
