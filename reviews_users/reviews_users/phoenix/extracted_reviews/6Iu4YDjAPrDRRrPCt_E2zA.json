The side dishes were not very good, but the desert was pretty good.  Did I mess up and not get the chicken fried steak which this restaurant is known for?  My health had the best of me when considering it was a fried dish, so I avoided it.  But then I opted for a very lean slab of beef which isn't exactly the healthiest either.  I do have to commend them in making Shiner Bock their house beer.  Luckily it wasn't the Lone Star.  The Shiner Bock Black was pretty good.",

    "text": "Most places I goto that have a smaller menu, I figure that it's due to them keeping it simple and as a result, having really good food. Now I totally missed the disclaimer on them menu saying that they do not season meat, but had I seen that it would of explained alot.   I got a chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and a salad with ranch dressing. The salad came out and the iceberg lettuce looked about 4 days  past due to the point where it had started to change colour. The ranch dressing covering the top tasted good but was a bit much.  The chicken fried steak that came next was huge x2, covered in white (un seasoned) gravy with a side of mashed potatoes covered in the same gravy. I feel that when I go out, I should not have to add extra seasoning to my food and having missed the warning, my first bite was not what I was expecting. The other reviews nailed it by saying it was bland, the flour batter on the steak, the steak itself, the white gravy, all very bland. Had I ordered without gravy, I could put some of the 30 condiments that were on the table, on the steak but, alas I thought the gravy would not work with hot sauce.  I'd probably come back and try it again now knowing that the meat isn't seasoned but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",

She brought some rolls, my drink and salad back within 2 or 3 minutes.  The main course, Chicken Fried Steak and Mashed Potatoes arrived a short time later.  I am not a small man, but this plate was packed with food and was too much for me to eat.  Everything tasted pretty good.  Overall, a good experience.  I would definitely eat here again.",

I think I've never had a bad meal there. The steaks could be thicker, I suppose. And they do grease 'em up before they grill 'em, but the over all effect with the mashed potatoes is pretty satisfying.  I always get a Shiner Bock when I'm there. At one time it was one of the few restaurants in the valley that had them available.  Parking is pretty bad, and the seats could be more comfortable. But basically, come hungry and leave happy.",

The filet piece of the steak was about the size of a JFK half dollar. Huge disappointment. My friend got the shrimp dish done on the grill instead of fried. One of the shrimps was raw and they were tiny. Huge rip off for $16. Two stars for friendly service, good potato wedges and biscuits. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",

I've pretty much had everything on the menu, and have never had anything I didn't like.  The Smoked Prime Rib is Stellar as are The Mashed Potatoes.  The Chicken Fried Steak and Chicken as well as the Catfish are the real deal.  They don't heavily season their food out of the kitchen.  Last time I checked that's what the salt and pepper on the table is for!  I personally like the Chili they serve as well, reminds me of the Classic Texas Brick Chili my Mom made when I was a kid.  The Atmosphere, decor is True Central Texas. You have to have lived there or visit a lot to truly appreciate The True Texas vibe of this place.  I'm truly at home here and will keep on coming back.  Steve and the gang have a great long standing tradition here. Anytime I have family or friends from Texas in town visiting I always bring them here, and they always leave with a smile on their faces just like I do... Very refreshing to have such a down home, feel good vibe Restaurant such as this in The Valley of The Sun.",

It's a locals only kind of joint, where the walls are covered with Texas signs, license plates, etc and the ceiling is covered with business cards and baseball hats. The booths are deep and cushy, and let you settle in and get comfortable. Or, if you are dining alone, you might choose to sit at the bar, especially when they are crowded at lunch.  My favorite lunch is the grilled chicken sandwich, only available at lunch, which comes with onion, lettuce, tomato, and pickle on the side. Try the dirty mashed potatoes with gravy for a real home cooked meal feeling. If you order a side salad, they come with sliced olives!  For dessert, I recommend the home made pecan pie with a scoop of Blue Bird vanilla ice cream on the top.  The price is good, the food is good, and the service is always great and with a smile.",

It was like stepping into an East Texas hometown, neighborhood restaurant. The decor had city limit signs, neons, pictures of Willie Nelson and Ronald Reagan. The delightfully tacky interior made me feel like I was home again.   Well, obviously like every other person that has written a Yelp review on TEXAZ Grill, we ordered the Chicken Fried Steak for our entrees. They first brought out rolls and biscuits. I like that the table has honey, hot sauce, and every other necessary condiment so you don't have to wait to have the server bring it over. We received a small plate of salad. Just enough to satiate the appetite's requirement for lettuce greens and ranch dressing.   My eyeballs literally popped out of socket when the server brought over our C.F.S. Oh Lawns, the portion was ENORMOUS!!! Like I told the server, everything really is bigger in Texas. The tender cubed steak was battered perfectly and smothered in a nice country gravy. Nonetheless, I decided to douse it in Cholula Sauce to give it a nice little kick. The mashed potatoes were definitely made Southern Style by mixing in the skins. By the time my tummy was ready to explode, I still had a full plate enough to share with two people. I am super surprised how large the portion is compared to the price point. Overall, a great deal and delicious meal. But eat here too often, and you will be contributing to the obesity epidemic in America.",

    "text": "This place has been located here for years and kept passing by their sign that said soooo many Chicken Fried Steaks served...naturally that peaked my interest.  So we finally made a point to go and try.  Their special was a BBQ Platter w/various smoked meats that had a sauce on top.  The meat itself was not seasoned a whole lot, for my taste, but the BBQ sauce was ok.  Their sausage was from Southside Market in (Elgin, TX) which was real good.  They also ship so this is a great way to test the sausage before you buy.  We also tried the Chicken Fried Steak, which comes with 2 pieces (1 HUGE piece that almost covered the entire plate and the other piece was 1/2 that size, so still very big).  The gravy they use was seasoned well, but again the Chicken Fried Steak was not seasoned enough for my taste.  The waitress, which I can't remember her name was very nice and attentive, which I like.   The restaurant itself was decorated with a lot of memorabilia, which was kind of cool and more importantly, it was dirty/dusty...so that is a good thing. I would definitely comeback again just to try other things on the menu.",

It's a huge monster, with a crispy double dipped batter layer encasing a beautiful tenderized steak, smothered with a beautiful white gravy. Without a doubt TEXAZ Grill has the best chicken fried steak in the Phoenix area, perhaps even Arizona!  Portions are huge too! The dinner portion actually gives you two steaks while the lunch portion gives you one. The coleslaw and mashed potatoes on the side were huge as well.  The restaurant is a bit small and the parking lot a bit smaller, but the interior is definitely cozy and the staff is very friendly. It really makes the meal worth it on top of the kick*** CFS. You NEED to try this out!",

    "text": "For Texas-sized portions at reasonable prices, look no further.  At Texaz Grill, they've perfected the art of breaded, deep fried foods.  I had the fried catfish, and tried the chicken fried steak.  The fried catfish was perfect.  The buttermilk breading was just the right amount of crispiness and had a great flavor to complement the delicate taste of the catfish.  The fish itself, was some of the best I've had.  The meat was very tender and flavorful.  The chicken fried steak was very good, with tender pounded beef and crispy breading.  There were 2 giant pieces on the platter, and it was topped with a generous amount of gravy.    As for sides, you have your choice of salad or coleslaw, and mashed potatoes or Texas fries.  I had some salad, which wasn't too impressive since it tasted like someone had made it way in advance, making it taste soggy and wilted.  The coleslaw was decent, in a mayo-based sauce that was tangy and sweet.  The mashed potatoes were a hearty portion of skin-on mash.    Service was friendly and drinks were refilled as needed.  Parking, on the other hand, is a nightmare if you come at a busy time.  Prices for dinner range from the teens to the low 20s, depending on what item you get.    So, I'd probably be interested in going here again next time I'm in the mood for some fried food, but only if it's at a less busy time where parking won't be as much of a hassle.",

So, do yourself a favor and don't be worried about how many calories you're about to intake when you visit this establishment.  Now, the food itself was okay. I was seriously expecting an explosion of chicken fried steak in my face! I was ready for pure sodium sin that would allow my taste buds to dance in circles around every morsel with pitch forks raised in True devil worshiping style. This was probably why I wasn't insanely impressed. The steak itself was pretty good, but the gravy wasn't what I expected at all. I've been spoiled in the past with overwhelmingly flavorful sausage gravy with biscuits, and that's what I was expecting. So be warned if you're expecting something similar to that. But, again mentioning portions, that was the biggest chicken fried steak that I've ever had.  Fried okra, a dinner salad and their red chili were also chosen off the menu that night. The okra was pretty good, just battered and deep fried, and served with some sort of sauce (I didn't examine it well enough to say what it was). The salads were pretty good, but go for the vinaigrette because the ranch was sort of bland. Oh, and be prepared for a lot of dressing. Lastly, the chili...it was served the proper way with cheese and onions, which was nice, but I wasn't blown away with the flavor of this either. In all honesty, it seemed like they meant to cook it with MGD, but didn't cook all of the alcohol out...it was essentially beer flavored chili.  I'm going to go back to TEXAZ for sure (waitress was pretty sweet by the way), but I think my next visit will be for lunch. Some of their sandwiches look fantastic, and I'm really hoping to become a big fan of TEXAZ after trying some of them.",

I moved away for 20 years and when my ex-mother-in-law came into town we decided to give Texaz Grill a try, not even thinking that it was the same place.   Boy! Were we pleasantly surprised!!  Nothing has changed! Not the decorations, not the menu, not the friendly staff, not the quality of the food...NOTHING!!! Ok. I'm lying. There was a different picture on the back of the ladies room door.  We all ordered the Ribeye with the house salad/house dressing, homemade mashed potatoes and cream gravy. I've dreamt about those mashed potatoes!! The steaks were perfect! Juicy, tender, flavorful, cooked to order. Chain steakhouses have NOTHING on this place!  We finished our meal with the homemade bread pudding with whiskey sauce. Trust me, you've never had bread pudding so good! Full of cinnamon, raisins, and pecans with the most delightful whiskey sauce.  If you live in Phoenix or are just passing through stop in at The Texaz Grill! You won't regret it!",

It is over the top, covered in Texas themed stuff, business cards covering the ceiling, and complete with Texas sized portions. I came here with my dad and his friend yesterday for lunch and was very impressed with this place. The lunch prices are a total steal, with most entrees costing 8$ and the portions big enough for two people. We split the (house specialty) chicken fried steak and a brisket sandwich. I don't know that I've ever had chicken fried steak before, and I don't know that I would ever have it again (the idea of frying steak just doesn't sit well with me.... if I'm gonna eat steak, I want to taste it), but this CFS was fairly good. The meat was surprisingly tender, the gravy was flavorful, the portion was obscenely large. It came with very tasty mashed potatoes, a biscuit, and some plain jane corn. The biscuit was good, but not the best in town. The real star of this place was the brisket. Ohhhh the brisket gods smile on this place for sure. Their brisket is super tender and the sauce they put on it was heavenly. I ate the brisket with a fork out of the bun because the bun just obscured the awesome brisket flavor, no need for it. I will definitely come back here for the brisket!",

Since I was starving, I chose not to wait and ordered their ribeye with mashed potatoes and gravy. It came with a very basic salad which was ok. When my meal came, I dug into the steak which was cooked correctly but I noticed a lot of oily liquid on the plate. This mystery liquid covered up whatever flavor the steak had. The gravy on the potatoes was strange tasting and I only took a couple bites.  Any other day I would have sent the meal back, but I was so tired and hungry after coming from the airport that I managed to down most of the steak even though it wasn't at all good. I wasn't going to complain after eating a decent portion of my food. The service was adequate but I can't recommend this place based on my meal.",

And corn which was as one would expect, and a buttermilk biscuit (nothing to write home about). We got an order of fried okra and that was fantastic. Just the right breading and the dipping sauce was out of this world!  The atmosphere here is of a style I like. Kind of divey, and full of nostalgia.

    "text": "So decided to try Texaz grill since I heard they have the best country fried steak in AZ. They also have good reviews. Go in and it's $16.50 for a fried steak and some mashed potatoes. $15 for catfish. A bit pricey but I press on. Get the food and I'm greeted with quite possibly the saddest plate ever. A small wallop of country gravy for two massive steaks on this tiny plate. It was honestly a little insulting.   But again I press on. Rear up to cut into this steak that has been so hyped. I raise my fork expected to be raised to heaven and...I'm met with the most tasteless piece of fried food I've ever had in my life. That couldn't be so I try again and again until I finally give. It has absolutely no flavor. Not only that but the breading is very thick and little meat present. Decide to try their Creole seasoning courtesy of zatarans at the table. It helped but not enough to pick the pieces up of my shattered expectations. I've had astronomically better country fried steak at country boys down the street. Even dennys. Mashed potatoes is the same. No flavor. Even the gravy has none. As a Texan I'm appalled honestly that this is considered the best. I push the plate away and prep to bag it up. Maybe my dogs will eat it :-(they didn't).  Move onto the catfish and same thing. No flavor with thick odd breading. Not the usual delicious crisp light cornmeal breading I'm used to in the South but something heavy and bland. No taste at all. Even covering it in spicy cocktail sauce couldn't help. Thinking about it. It didnt seem like any catfish I've ever had. Seemed more like cod. Either way it was awful.  I'm defeated and we leave disappointed. Lol Worst $34 I've spent. Food was just lifeless. Save yourself the anguish and go to country boys on camelback or even Denny's. This is one disappointed Texan.",

The waitress tried to take away one of our tables because we were not all there at 410. I think they were bothered because we had presents on the table and in some chairs. Ar 5 the manager came over and said you had a reservation for 12 where is the rest of your party?  Really? By 515. We were all there ordering food and eating. I myself spent 90 bucks. The service was terrible had to ask for things 3 and 4 times.  Very few people were there until right before 7pm it started picking up but there were plenty of empty tables. A few minutes after 7 the manager came to our table where people still had food in front of them and said we had to leave because we had had the table for 3 hours. Mind you there were 10 middle aged women drinking and eating. No one was rude or loud except for the manager of this establishment. I have never been treated like this for no reason before. I will never go here again.",

He got the chicken fried steak.  I got the chicken fried chicken.  It was very good... smothered in gravy kind of good.  WOW!  I did not think I could, but I ate the WHOLE thing.  ALL OF IT!  The service was great.  The only thing sucked is the parking...  I parked across the street and waddled or rolled back to my car after dinner.  Maybe I needed the extra walking steps for the calories I inhaled?",

I have given this establishment 4 stars not for the venue or the ambiance of the furnishings, but, for the quality of the food, service and the wholesomeness of the experience. The food is home cooked and portions are very generous.  Their chicken fried steak is one of the main stays of this business. I had that item for my lunch. I took home the remains of my lunch and my wife and finished for lunch the next day. The steak hangs over all sides of the plate. The price of $9 was  a real bargain.  If in the area or if you want to try a restaurant that represents what the old west was about 50 years ago, this is the place. Nothing fancy just good fixins.",

    "text": "One of my favorite meals is the chicken fried steak, mashed potato's, both covered with milk gravy and a side of fried okra.  Talk about memories, my mom's is the best.  So when we discovered this place, we didn't know if it would match my memories or be another frozen mock up.  Walking in, the decor is really country chic, very old school, from the old photo's, the license plates to the lighting.  Our server was quick and friendly.  We got our food and it was delicious, since my meal didn't come with the fried okra, it was an add on, it came out way before our meal along with the bread, and both was eaten way before the main meal, but, they were hot and I didn't want them to cool off, so we ate.  As for the chicken fried steak, the breading was close, but not exact to my mothers, it didn't taste or look like a frozen piece, so it was one the best, chunky, breading, golden brown, tender steak.   So someone knew what they were doing with cube steak!",

Granted, this is NOT Health food and not advertised as such, but for a truly guilty pleasure when my stomach's grumbling, you'll find me waiting at a table for a chicken fried steak.

    "text": "Being a Texas Native and foodie. This place is legit. Being my first time here thanks to a Yelp search for chicken fried steak this was on top of the list, I had to check it out. Seeing the decor on the wall I had to make a Texas License Plate donation because after two years of being here I finally caved in and registered my car in AZ and coincidentally had it in my trunk. This donation yielded the opportunity to meet Steve the owner. Steve was awesome we chatted about Tex-Mex food and life in Texas. It was delightful meeting him.   Now on to the food. We ordered a dish on their daily special of biscuits topped with a chicken fried steak topped with eggs. This may sound weird but that's how you eat them in Texas. Food was killer. Steve was also generous in bringing us a sample of his BBQ brisket and mash potatoes. Again legit Texas style food. As BBQ competition person whose tasted some of the best BBQ in Texas I have to give two thumbs up, all the food had great flavor. And we even tried the cobbler topped with Bluebell ice cream. Which if it had anything other than Bluebell than that would be a sin.   We will be back to try other menu items and next time go with a bigger appetite.",

It's still crowded and with the animals, posters, newspaper articles on the walls and hundreds of ballcaps hanging from the ceiling, the atmosphere at Texaz is a genuine version of the type of place that chain restaurants pay designers big money to create. For kids, its a cornucopia of sights and sounds to look at which accounts for the two stars I'm giving it.  However, it doesn't get any more stars because the food has really gone downhill. Naturally my wife and I ordered the meal that this restaurant is famous for - chicken-fried steak with mashed potatoes and gravy and as I said, we hadn't been there in about ten years, but there is no way the food used to be this bland. Unfortunately, this was one of the most boring chicken-fried steaks I have ever had. The breading had no flavor and the gravy didn't add any either. I like good chicken fried steak, but this wasn't it. In fact, I'd be embarrassed to bring anyone from Texas to this place.  Sorry Texaz, I know you're a Central Phoenix institution, but you're riding on past glory.",

    "text": "It's always a good sign when you open a menu and it doesn't require a Cliffs Notes version.  That means what they do, they do really well. This place is no exception.   The chicken fried steak (the lunch menu version might I add) was very, very generous.  Two out of our party of three ordered that right up. The third was an order of chicken fingers from the kids menu.  The kids menu has a nice selection of choices that are sure to please even the pickiest of palattes (prime rib!), and the chicken fingers were really delicious - tender, juicy and seasoned well.  Though my kiddo preferred ranch dressing, I'd opt for a vat of their gravy if it were up to me!  The chicken fried steak was cooked perfectly.  Anyone who knows anything about chicken fried steak knows there is an art to the fork tender meat and that perfect crust-to-meat ratio.  Well, they nailed it.  Each bite of the \"skin-on little bit lumpy like your momma would make\" mashed potatoes was a heavenly little vehicle for their yummy country gravy.  The corn was corn.  Even the corn knows it's not the star of this dish, so it's there for support.  Biscuits were hot and tasty. Half the  biscuit got some gravy lovin' and the other half, a little kiss of butter and honey.  Blue Bell ice cream cups for the kids were a nice treat.  So the food's great, no lie.  But I'd come back even if it wasn't because the service was stellar: friendly, engaging and welcoming.  Do yourself a favor, especially if you're needing a taste of home, and check this place out.",

I stomped on my brakes and made some tires squeal as I stopped to turn into this place when I was perusing for places to eat.  I'm certainly glad I did.  There are certain health related lines the people of Colorado do not like to cross, and every once in a while I just really want everything deep fried.    I started off my evening with some Deep Eddy grapefruit vodka on the rocks.  Feeling like home already.  I sat at the bar, and the bartender was very nice and attentive.  She gave me advice on where to stay, what to do, ect.  I ordered fried okra as an appetizer because I miss all things okra.  It was hand battered and not the prefrozen BS you sometimes get at lower tier BBQ joints.  It came with this mustard based sauce which was delicious.  I of course sprinkled some Texas Pete's pepper sauce on top which is how God intended fried okra to be consumed.    I then moved on to the fried catfish.  I got the cole slaw and salad as a side.  I was a little worried because the catfish isn't corn meal battered like I'm so used to, but it was crisp, delicious, and hit the spot.  I squeezed lemon on top and sprinkled on some zatarains seasoning blend, and gave it a good dunk in the tartar sauce.  I ordered the lemonade drink special which featured titos vodka, prickly pear syrup, lemonade, and bubble water.  It was very refreshing and complimented my dinner.    This will be my watering hole every time I come into Phoenix.  Definitely worth the stop.",

The owner came by and played trivia with all of the kids at the table and gave out prizes for the right answers. How often does something like that happen?    Service - Our service was top notch!  We each ordered several courses and our server was always on top of drink refills, each order was correct, and we had to ask for nothing as she anticipated what each of us would need.  She was quiet but very thoughtful.  Food - Giant - Texas size portions, great tasting and very reasonably priced, considering our group was mostly teenagers what more could you ask for?  The chicken fried steak is amazing!!!  Decor/ambience - lots and lots of things on the wall and an infinite amount of Texas kitsch.  I would recommend Texaz for lunch or dinner any day of the week.

The waitress asked my daughter of something was wrong since she only ate a few bites so I explained she didn't like it. She just said ok and walked away. The shrimp was good, but pricey. The bugers were just ok. At the end they were pushing for us to take it home since we ate almost none of it. We politely declined and she still came out with boxes trying to get us to take it. The chicken fried chicken that my daughter's friend ordered  was another item thatcwas horrible.  The gravy had no flavor and when I tasted it the piece I had was so fatty. I pulled the skin out of it and it didn't even look fully cooked. Maybe we were there on an off night, who knows, but for me it was very pricey for the quality of food we recieved.  Nothing had flavor so I guess that's why all the sauces and spices are in the table.",

The chopped brisket sandwich was really quiet good despite being served upside down.  Maybe that's the thing.  I ordered a frito pie and and it came on bag ready to go.  What a good ole Sunday place. They brought be a fun little fried rice cake beignet thing with a good amount of powdered sugar and life was good.

The portions however are not so small.  I went for Brunch and of course I had to try the chicken fried steak everyone raves about. I was not disappointed in the CFS, just as the man other yelpers state, it is Indeed very good. Not made of the usual ground beef type of meat, it was more of an actual deep fried thinly pound steak.  What also came as a surprise, was how much I enjoyed the side dishes. The gravy was amazing, as were the biscuits and if your thirsty, may I suggest the Turlingua Sunrise. I cannot wait to come back and try a big juicy steak.  God bless Texas!",

We saw the chicken fried steak review in the Arizona Republic's annual Roundup of the best in Arizona and went to try it out. The CFS is itself pretty ordinary, but then, how good can CFS be? Is a pretty simple dish made from a cheap cut of meat. The accompanying mashed potatoes were just okay. I must say that the coleslaw is the best I've ever had.   The portions are over the top gigantic. There is no way a normal person can eat this meal: for $14 you get two absolutely enormous pieces of meat covered in breading and smothered in cream gravy. As a result, there was a lot of waste-we paid attention, and didn't see a single person come close to finishing their meal. Of course, a lot of people then take it home, but warmed up chicken fried steak? Really? The waitress agreed that they serve way too much food-she said they often suggest to management just serving one piece of meat, But for some reason they don't, except for lunch. I guess they prefer to make their contribution to America's obesity problem.    We arrived 6PM  Friday night and had a short, 10 minute wait. They only take reservations for 6 or more.",

Whether this was intentional or not, I had to put a lot of salt and pepper on it to taste the gravy.  The atmosphere is what you would expect from a diner.  Trucker hats and outdated memorabilia galore. The best part of the experience was the owner/chef coming out to converse with everyone in the restaurant to see how the food was.  Props for that!  The staff was also very friendly and attentive.    Plan in gaining a pound or two when eating here.

    "text": "Reading the reviews I was expecting some good food.  It wasnt even close to what I got. In fact Im not completely sure what I got. I had ordered their ribeye cooked medium. Let me just say for a ribeye I am expecting a tender juicy steak. The ratio between meat and fat was terrible. I had more fat than I did meat and the meat that I did have was chewy like leather. My friend had the brisket sandwhich which was ridiculously bland. Salt and pepper didnt even help. The salads we both got were questionable and had a weird taste that I couldnt put my finger on.  The service was friendly and personable. But when something wasnt correct they did little to nothing to fix it. The server acknowledged  that the salads were not the best but didnt offer to exchange it for anything else. She had also acknowledged that the meat was tough and chewy when she saw me struggling, but still didnt offer to exchange it out. It was very disappointing, especially when you're a steak lover like me. I dont think ill be back sadly.",

I ordered a CFS(Chicken Fried Steak), which came with mashed potatoes, corn and a biscuit = $10. The CFS was the size of a big plate, definitely worth the $10. The gravy was excellent, and had a butteriness to it. The CFS itself was flavorful and crunchy. The steak was not tough at all, like some CFS can be, just like how I remembered from Texas. Definitely check this place out.",

The Cfs was platter sized! Lightly breaded with mashed potatoes and corn. Very tasty. My catfish and okra was excellent. We took home a ton of food. Husband wanted to try dessert.

    "text": "I must start with a disclaimer. I gave them three stars because the type of food they serve does not fit my lifestyle or diet. And that is not necessarily a fair way to judge.  It is a very unique restaurant. Very old-school Phoenix. Much like the old pinnacle Peak patio. There is lots of nostalgia pieces hanging from the walls. Most of the staff has worked there for about 10 years or more. They really do offer fantastic service. It is a great place to bring guests from out of town so they can experience Old Phoenix.  Going back to the food. Lots of what they make is deep fried. Which if you love that kind of food this is your place. I understand the chicken fried steak is bigger than the plate. The pork chops I had I asked for them to be grilled and they were fine but bland. They did want me to put their gravy on it, Which I don't prefer, but I did ask for it on the side so I could taste it. To me it was not remarkable. Their salads are very much plain. They used mainly iceberg restaurant bag type mix. I had the balsamic dressing which they make and it was tasty but it was much too much of it for my taste.   So I do hope you understand, just because this place isn't for me doesn't mean it isn't a lot of fun and a great place to go. Give it a try and draw your own conclusion.",

You'd expect to see Willie Nelson here but if there you'd probably hear him. To begin we had biscuits & honey . Next came large cole slaw and nice dinner salad both very good . We shared the mulligan 16 oz smoked prime rib with large portion of mashed potatoes with the skins & homemade gravy. Also shared a huge chicken fried steak smothered in gravy. Lastly had a brisket sandwich with long strips of the bbq pecan smoked brisket on French roll w real Texas potato home fries. Great service from Josephine , food came amazing fast . I m sure will be back I'd like to try the cod fish & chips. Available on an early bird menu 4-6 with other options . They have a good looking Fourth of July menu too. Great food & Tex az western decor ! We'll be back partner !",

It feels like you've been transformed into a Texas country bar. We were immediately greeted by the hostess and sat down inside of a booth. The menu is right side up on the table. Inside the menu are comfort foods to order such as, chicken fried steak, fried okra, steak and burgers. Of course, I ordered the chicken fried steak with the gravy on the side; it was so delicious. Five stars!! It was good enough to feed two people. Additionally, the bread pudding is served warm with whiskey sauce. It was a perfect ending to dinner when you're all fried up!",

I ordered the chicken fried steak sandwich hopping that it was smaller than the chicken fried steak that I saw someone getting as I walked in. I was wrong about that, it had three complete pieces of chicken fried steak on it. It tasted great, I also had mashed potatoes over the fries which I liked the mashed potatoes a lot.   On the down side.   Parking! The parking lot sucked, it was extremely small, and my car was hit in the parking lot and no one left a note.  Service, it blew. I was sat in the very back near the restrooms, and the waitress would never get to me. The waitress always took care of the three or four people that were near the front. If the food wasn't as good as it was and the memorabilia wasn't nearly as good they would get a one star from me. I was going to say something to the manager on the way back but didn't have the opportunity.   Cheers!",

    "text": "Wasn't crazy about this place. We started with fried okra & beer battered shrimp and for our main course we had the chicken fried steak, chicken fried chicken and brisket sandwich. From the kids menu, we ordered  smoked prime rib. And for dessert we ordered the peach cobbler.  For starters, the biscuits and rolls we got didn't taste fresh, in fact, they tasted like they'd been warmed up in a microwave. Already a terrible start. But it did get better with our apps. The fried okra was very good, the okra was ripe, not at all bitter. The beer battered shrimp was also very good, light batter, fresh shrimp, our meal was looking better.  Then dinner came, the chicken fried chicken was delicious, the chicken was juicy and battered very nicely. My chicken fried steak however, was very bland and there was so much more batter than meat. The gravy was very good and sort of made up for the steak. The brisket sandwich was very dry so we ordered a side of BBQ sauce, without it, it wasn't very appetizing, with it, it was pretty darn good, nothing fancy, just a lot of brisket and bread. The smoked prime rib from the kids menu was OK. It had a lot of fatty parts, I may be biased as I'm not a prime rib fan though. We could definitely taste the smoky flavor. We ordered a side salad with both steak dinners and they both tasted like bagged salad. Nothing great about the dressings either. The mashed potatoes that came with the steaks were pretty good, they had skin pieces which I personally love. No gravy, but I prefer mashed potatoes without so I was happy there.  My favorite dish of the evening was the peach cobbler. The peaches weren't fresh, they were frozen so I was slightly disappointed but the crust part made up for it. The crust, made from their biscuit batter, was slightly sweet and tasted just right with the peaches and vanilla ice cream, (adding ice cream is $1 extra).  Overall, I didn't hate this place but I certainly didn't love it. The portions are massive so go hungry or prepare to take lots of leftovers home.",

If you want something a little smaller---and that's not saying much, since their portions are huge, get the brisket sandwich, ask for the bbq sauce on the side, and ask for a side of au ju.  You won't regret it.  It's amazing!!    Don't expect some fancy schmancy steakhouse--but go hungry and you won't regret your decision to go there!",

Its dark and a bit crowded feeling inside, with lots of stuff on the walls, and feels dirty, even though I'm sure it's clean. Prices were reasonable, especially considering the huge portions of food. I ordered their \"famous\" Chicken fried steak. I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting, but what I got was not what I was hoping for. the breading on the chicken wasn't very crispy and had very little flavor. The gravy had even less flavor than the batter and only succeeded in making everything soggy. The steak itself was cooked well but fatty, flavorless, and hard to cut. the salads and side dishes were equally mediocre.   Nothing special about TexAZ Grill.",

We ordered a salad and fried okra to go along with the meal   I had the Southern Pork Chop, mashed potatoes, corn, biscuits and gravy( I make better biscuits) and hubby had the Chicken Fry, which he brought half of home with us. The pork chop was tender and juicy and almost fork tender, I ate all of it, left most of  the mashed potatoes and the corn, probably because we ate the salad and the okra first. I like the inside although it is a little dark, very kitchy with all the license plates from all over. I say go, eat, waddle home...it is worth it and it is great comfort food!",

They pride themselves on the chicken fried steak but can't seem to let the batter finish frying. I've tried it over and over and it's always been underdone. My guess is that since I eat there between 2 and 6pm each time, they have the least experienced kitchen person at the fryer. i like to go to local places and will go back here, but i expect i'm going to bang my head on the wall for doing it.",

The spots themselves are short and it's difficult to get into and out of the lot. Not sure if there is a special trick to parking here but please keep in mind when you come that parking is sucky.   Now, bear in mind when you come here, there are not many \"healthy options\" on the menu. And they are not ashamed of this at all. They embrace the Texas size deep fried, heavily battered foods they offer unabashedly. As someone who is careful about what I eat, I did manage to get a salad and felt good about it. All the dishes came out at the proper temperatures and were freshly made and nicely plated.   Looking forward to going back in the near future!",

We started with a side of fried okra. Yum. Awesome breading, everything fresh and hot.  My husband ordered the lunch version of chicken-fried steak. He was in heaven. I tried a small bite. I'm not usually a fan of chicken fried steak, but it was fabulous.  My options were a little limited because I can't do really heavy fried stuff. I had the Dallas Tacos. They were good. Nothing spectacular but still satisfying. Let's face it--no one is coming here for tacos! Check out the Yelp photo gallery to see my plate.  I usually don't do dessert out, but bread pudding is my Kryptonite. Too many people on Yelp praised this dessert dish, and with reason. My word. The bread pudding was sweet, firm, and delicious. We ordered it with the scoop of ice cream, which ended up being HUGE. Texas-sized. The whiskey sauce on top is luscious.  In the rare event that we're back in this part of Phoenix, we will definitely stop here. For the sake of our waistlines, it's probably a good thing it isn't closer...",

    "text": "Being Texas-transplants, we'd been wanting to try TEXAZ Grill for some time, (but it's pretty far from the 'Copa). Upon entering, we thought we'd found another treasure like the renowned Babe's Fried Chicken as the decor is really cool, and there is a friendly, upbeat vibe.   Our waitress was super!   Two glasses of Chardonnay were very good, and a bargain for $5 each.   As others have mentioned, the portions are HUGE, and the mashed potatoes, biscuit and corn were excellent!   Unfortunately, the stars of the show, Chicken Fried Steak and Chicken Fried Chicken were just fair. The CFS was the biggest disappointment as it lacked proper seasoning, and was pounded way too thin which causes over-breading. The CHC was better and was perfectly cooked, but a bit over-breaded and needed more seasoning as well (Churches or Popeyes is better).   As any Texan well knows, you can hide a lot of mediocre food under outstanding gravy (sorry Mom) but we found the gravy slightly sweet for our palettes.   We will certainly be back to try the brisket as it smelled great!",

My mother travels with her emotional support dog with all the proper paper work and tonight as she entered the restaurant she was greeted at the front door with not a welcome but a quick comment about if her support dog going to stay it would have to be on the floor under the table!  It was not a nice way to be greeted as we entered the restaurant.   My mother's support animal is less than 5 lbs and sits on the seat next to her with a blanket and is quiet and well behaved as she has been trained. We have been to this restaurant many times and the never had any issues before tonight. The same person who made those  comments tonight had never said anything before on our prior visits and in fact even commented about her dog seated on the seat next to her just how cute her dog was. It was not what he said but how he said it tonight. I have always enjoy this restaurant in the past but after tonight I will not be back again.  I am disappointed in the way entire the situation was handled. We are respectful of others and understand that some might not want to have a dog in the restaurant and if we were asked nicely and respectfully it would be different.  We will not be back there again there  are to many other restaurants that will welcome us to spend our money and time. Disappointed to say the least!!",

    "text": "This place has great comfort food, nothing fancy but I don't expect nor want it from a place like this. We have been here twice and both times were excellent. The first time around I ordered the chicken fried steak and it was flavorful not to mention massive. This last time I decided to change things up and get the catfish, and I have to say this was easily the best catfish I've gotten from a restaurant, it is perfectly seasoned and melts in your mouth. Catfish isn't my favorite fish and far too many places can't make it properly, the sweetness of the catfish almost overpowers things. Not here, the flavor of the breading and the work in harmony. I will definitely get catfish again here! Oh yeah, their Texas Potatoes (or whatever they are called) are good as well, basically they are potato chunks that are fried, in fact I am willing to bet they double fry them to give the outerlayer a crispy texture.   The restaurant itself resembles your typical small town restaurant, and that is fine with me since I grew up with restaurants like it. Their walls are covered with pictures, posters, signs and whatever else they can put up on it, it gives it an unique look. If you want a \"nice\" restaurant then you better look elsewhere, but if you want a hometown family restaurant and bar setting this is your place.  Service is fantastic as well, our server was constantly refilling our drinks and extremely friendly. One nice aspect of this place is that they give you large glasses for your beverage, so you usually only need a refill or two, we had a bit more because we were recovering from the summer heat.  Also for the record they carry Pepsi products, which is a bonus for me, but may not be for others.  In regards to price, they aren't cheap (the chicken fried steak is around 13 and the catfish for two big filets was around 12), but you will have more then enough food so it works out in the long run.   Overall a great small town style restaurant and bar if you are looking for a hearty meal that is made right.",

    "text": "No False advertising here.  Just the best damn chicken fried steak I've had in Phoenix (and BBQ beef ribs, see update).  We also got the bbq pork sandwich which was so mouth wateringly good that I wished Texaz would just go ahead and deliver a full line of bbq items...and stop teasing me with just this one tempting tasty bit  Really generous portions. The sides was just typical..but with the mains this good, I couldn't really care.   My plate was overflowing and my jeans needed loosening after the super yummy and yet easy on the wallet lunch.  Update:  We've been on the hunt for BBQ beef ribs which doesn't seem as popular as pork ribs.  It may not be as tender as pork but the flavor is what we're after.  When we heard that our favorite Texan restaurant serves it only on Tuesday nights, we had to make the trip.  We arrived after 9pm but luckily they still had one order left.   $11 for five giant beef back ribs - slow-smoked over hickory and oak, topped with a homemade BBQ sauce and served with their rustic mashed potatoes.   The dry spice-rub had so infused into the meat during the long slow cooking process that we didn't need the sauce.  Eating beef ribs is a carnivorous act - almost caveman like - if it wasn't for the fact that the server thoughtfully brought us a warm wet napkin to wipe our saucy fingers on.  Despite the tastiness of the ribs, there was just so much of it that even with the two of us sharing, we could not finish it.  It made for a tasty lunch the day after.",

    "text": "So you're with a bunch of people who like chicken fried steak, and they say, hey theres this steak house you should try with us. This should be your first warning. If a steak house is known for its chicken fried steak, something is not right.  Maybe you're different, maybe you think, sure, they like chicken fried steak, and I like fried asshole. Then this is your place!  Now, you go in, and ahh the ambiance, shit on the walls as far as the eye can see, oh and not just the walls, the ceiling as well! Its jam packed, you can't hear the person in front of you, you're thinking, when's the last time they dusted all this crap? How much falls in my food from the lazy ceiling fans.   Its hot and a bit humid to, maybe to recreate that True texas experience?  So you order your tbone, medium rare, side of mashed potatoes and hell, some okra while you're at it. Good okra is hard to find in these parts.  The okra, crispy, soft inside (once its done being molten lava), perfect. Don't bother with the sauce unless your garnish for okra is tartar sauce.  Hey, a side salad come with it! Oh, the tiny diced tomatoes, ice burg lettuce, and what an interesting mix, diced green olives all over the top, in giant piles.  Now your entree comes, but the waitress, if you're lucky, has worked there 4 years! Shes got a blond dye job, too much eye makeup, and a perm. She makes sure to leave every single dish on the table, just in case you missed one delicious crumb. At some point she might drop by one basket of rolls, for a table of 8. The buttermilk ones taste homemade, not bad!  Oh yes, the entree, a tbone, super thin, in what is that? Its pooling everywhere, oh god the grease. You did order your steak with a large slathering of grease right? Well those mashed potatoes, which are thick and standard, are drenched in heavy white gravy, and all the blandness of the gravy helps soak up all that grease!  So you're almost done with your food, omg, your giant glass is empty? Where was that waitress? Oh don't worry, just grab her by the arm and she'll try to remember to refill your drink. And those extra plates, well if they're really bothering you you can ask a bus person to take them, though you might as well be asking them to lick your shoe (or eat what you just did).   Now you're full, you've paid, and because of its \"prime\" location, you get to cross a busy intersection to get to the car you had to park across the street.   Might as well just wait to get home to pee too, its sweltering in there, more crap on the walls and ceiling, and you pretty much have to stand on the toilet to get the stall door closed.",

    "text": "Let me start this review by saying that I am a huge fan of TEXAZ Grill.  I have been enjoying their CFS since they were Lone Star (over 20 years).    My wife and I stopped in this past Saturday (03/22/2014) for an early lunch.  We were immediately \"greeted and seated\".  Our server came by for our drink order and I also ordered a cup of the \"Sopa de Fidello\" (my main reason for this visit).  The soup came and was very, very good.   I normally get a cup of their wonderful chili, but I really wanted to try this soup after reading the description on line.  I wasn't disappointed in the least.  Chunks of ham, vegetables, and the video noodles; all in a spicy, savory broth.  I would love a big bowl of this soup and some wonderful chewy, crusty bread on a cold winters night (yes, I know I'm in Phoenix, but I can dream...).  Both my wife and I had a salad w/ the house dressing and the lunch sized Chicken Fried Steak.  I love the house dressing at TEXAZ.  My wife (a former ranch dressing girl) now orders the house dressing, it's so good. The salad is evenly coated w/ dressing, and there is never a glob of it on the plate when you're done.  What can I say about the CFS, that hasn't been said many times before...it was perfect as usual.  The CFS came w/ mashed potatoes, corn, and a biscuit.  The steaks were hanging over the sides of the plate.  Fresh, hot and perfectly seasoned.  I have tried this dish at other restaurants, only to be disappointed w/ the food.   I didn't get the name of our server, but she was great.  She came and checked on us regularly and was pleasant and quick w/ the tea refills.  Yet another great meal at one of my favorite restaurants...  I think there are many restaurants here in the valley that could learn something from TEXAZ and their longevity here in a place known for \"here today and gone tomorrow\". Quality and consistency.  Start w/ quality ingredients and quality people; and keep it consistent.",

Ordered the chili on top of the chicken fried steak. First the biscuit was just a little bigger than a silver dollar. The breading on the chicken fried steak would not stay on the one quarter inch or less thickness of the crushed steak. The steak was way oversized and came dripping with grease from the kitchen dripping on my clothes. I got it with chili on top probably got 3 heaping tablespoons of chili at a price of 2.50. The chicken fried. steak was barely palatable- - - after the breading sluffed off of the steak. Never was asked if i Wanted a refill on my tea. My friends was the same way. Host came by to check did not have the nerve to tell him how repulsive it was- - that was my fault.",

    "text": "Wow. One of the worst meals I've had in awhile.  My husband and I came here for some Chicken Fried Steak because he went about 3 years ago and said it was awesome. We showed up and knew that we wanted to order the Chicken Fried Steak right away. They took our order, we waited shortly and our salad came out. Wasn't the best salad. Wasn't really fresh..had a lot of ranch on it, but I can see how somebody might like it. Ate some of it and pushed it to the side.  Soon our steak arrived. I was so excited to try it! I took my first bite and was shocked to find that it was completely bland. I added some salt and ate some more. The meat wasn't the best, which I understand because it's chicken fried steak, however it tasted frozen to me. After the 4th bite, I had to ask my husband if it tasted the same as before. He shook his head no and commented on how disguising it was. Even the mashed potatoes were bland. I agreed and started to feel gross thinking about eating any more of it.    We both pushed out dishes to the side, with lots of food still left on our plate. When our waitress came by about 10 minutes after she dropped the food off, we told her we were done. She asked if we wanted a box, which we declined, but otherwise no questions or concerns - she didn't even seem to notice that we ate almost nothing off of our plates. Didn't feel like bringing it up at the time, so we just paid our $35 for and left. I hate KFC and I would much sooner eat that than eat here again..",

    "text": "Okay, how can you not like Texaz Grill? Bad mood? Not hungry? Vegan? Bringing a baby carrier? Then you should probably stay home. Yes, it's a dive in an aging strip mall at 16th and Bethany. Yes, there is lots of junk hanging from the ceiling and walls that a few won't appreciate as low-brow Texas ambiance. And yes, the portions tend to be on the \"enormous\" side so if you're watching your waistline, plan on splitting a meal.   But rest assured the place is a Phoenix icon and will be 'til way after you're gone. It is texas-style comfort food - nice and simple. The steaks are great - they cut and age their own like a real steakhouse. The prime rib, when you arrive early enough, is superb - and shockingly cheap considering the cut. And I doubt you'd find a better, more authentic texas-style chicken fried steak (and chicken fried chicken) anywhere in town. So big you'll want to share - or take 1/2 home. But is is goooood.  If you're a newbie to Texas Grill - it's good to know that probably 90% of the clientele are regulars and are likely close personal friends to the staff of many years. This tip is helpful so that you don't get lynched by the surrounding tables for dissing the busy waitress because your water glass gets low. Come to Texaz in a good mood and ready to eat and you'll be fine. In time the staff may take a cotton to you too - but you'll have to earn it.  There's not a mistake on the menu. One great value is to order the chop steak as a burger (it's not on the menu) and you'll have one of the best burgers in town. If you're a party of one or there's a few open seats - belly up to the bar. Tammy and Cindy are the usual evening bartenders and they serve one of the best margaritas in town - on the rocks (only) and with salt of course. The selection at the bar is simple and basic, but you'll be entertained all night trying to read decades of bumper stickers and fridge magnets. You may even meet a few new friends as the regulars are a friendly bunch (especially after a marg or two).  When visitors come to town, you can bet Texaz is always in the mix. Sure we hit Scottsdale for glam, downtown for urban cool, and Barrio or Richardsons for nuevo mexican - but for a fun evening with friends plus good comfort food, you can't beat Texaz.  Watch for us at the bar!",

Great service - very sweet, patient waitresses. You know, the \"what can I get you sweetie?\" kind of waitresses. Gotta love em. The interior is phenomenal and cozy - a little crowded but  actually really cozy once you get settled in.   The bad: Like I said, it is very crowded. I suggest not going at dinner time. There always seems to be a wait and...there's really no place to wait. Last time I went was about 7:30 PM and there was a long line and we were forced to wait outside, not even close to the front door. Fortunately, not for long! So kudos for that.   Above all, great atmosphere, great food, great service - HIGHLY recommend if you're in the mood for a lil southern cookin!",

    "text": "After reading all the reviews on this page I made the decision to have dinner here on Saturday with my husband. We were both very excited, my husband loves chicken fried steak and although money is a little tight we wanted to splurge a little for date night. It was busy but we got seated right away and knew within minutes what we wanted to order. We started off with a bowl of chili to share. The chili was very good, with lots of meat and had great flavor. The side salad that accompanied was fine too. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Now on to the main course, and this is where I have to say we were very disappointed. My husband had the chicken fried steak, and yes it was definitely huge, however there was no flavor to it whatsoever. Even the gravy tasted of flour and not much else. A little seasoning (salt & pepper) would have gone a long way. I had the grilled pork chops and mashed potatoes. The pork chops were a little dry, and again under-seasoned, the mashed potatoes were ok, but I could see what my husband was talking about on the gravy. We so wanted this to be a great experience for us but the food just missed the mark. My husband did want to tell the server about it, but I'm always too self-conscious about making a complaint that I begged him to let it go.",

I prefer to sit at the bar with Tammy and have a salad and a burger, or maybe the Chicken or Beef Kabob (Ask for it dry \"no butter\").  Also love the Chili and the Fried Shrimp.  Ask for extra mushrooms is yummy to me.  Furthermore, the Thursday BBQ special rocks (but split it with someone as it is huge).  The Friday night Fish and Chips is delicious.  Not a fan of Liver and Onions ever so I wouldn't order it.  Sometimes the salads can be pretty heavy on dressing.    Biggest gripe = I used to order my Vodka Tonic, till I found out they use an \"Absolute 100\" vodka or something similar that is 100 Proof.  In my opinion it is totally wrong to serve somebody  a \"100\" vodka versus the normal \"80\".  It is the same as ordering a rum and coke and getting Barcadi 151 rum instead.   A totally different product.  Can you tell this is an issue for me?  Otherwise one of my favorite watering holes for sure.  Nice people too.",

I've traveled to all of it's major cities and to many more of the out of the way places.  To walk into Texaz Grill took me right back to being in Texas, which I only left 2 months ago.  From the first sip of a Shiner beer, to the Blue Bell ice cream sticker on the fridge, from floor to ceiling, this place bleeds Texas pride.  When I walked out, I almost expected to find myself in the humidity and heat of the Lone Star state, Texaz Grill could hold it's own versus any long standing place in Texas.  As for the food, couldn't be better.  The portions are large and leftovers are plenty, but it's so good that you may just want to try and eat it all in one sitting.  The Texas chili is right on the mark with how chili should taste.  Set your expectations accordingly when you go to Texaz Grill, this is a down home place where you can relax and enjoy the comfortable atmosphere as well as great food.  If you want crystal glasses and overly dressed waiters, go somewhere else.  If you're from Texas, well then come get a taste of home, if you're from any where else, come experience a real slice of the Lone Star state.",

The batter was light and crispy, the steak was moist and the country gravy, to die for.  I've had plenty of chewy chicken fried steak in my life with mediocre gravy. This was definitely the BEST chicken fried steak I've ever had. The waitress was super busy as they bus their own tables, but we never felt neglected. I just noticed how busy she was.  So the fact that she was slammed and her service never suffered was huge to me.  The manager or maybe the owner was coming around to all the tables and asking everyone how the food was and chatting with the regulars. I love that type of service. We raved about the food and told him it was our first time in and he gave me and my mother a card for a free dessert on our next visit!!  So what else can I do BUT give this place 5 stars.

From what I've heard, so far so good. So why not five stars you ask? Let's expand the diversity! Although the food caters to majority Caucasian descent, especially with Texaz Grill down home cooking, minorities are amiss. However, now that it's minority owned do you think that will that change and if so, how will that effect the current clientele? And if there were any minorities, I didn't see them and sorry, I forgot to look back in the kitchen and I can say that cause I'm Mexican American!",

Don't go and test this place out, if you're going for the first time invite everyone that you know because it's a gift and you will not be disappointed.",

Delicious gravy like my Cajun Texan Dad makes from scratch, toasted bun and fresh tomato, onion, pickle, and lettuce. And two perfect full size chicken fried steaks! Fabulous and generous lunch. Fried potatoes nice and well-done like I like 'em!  I will be back with friends to try the hard core stuff. Only wish they had loaded baked potatoes and baked beans.",

The chicken fried steak is probably one of the best ones I have ever had.  I like chicken fried steak, but my doctor does not like me eating it.  What a great place to eat.

I'm not sure why you would buy a restaurant that has been successful for 30 years and then start changing shit. It saddens me that it is not the same, but l won't be back",

Salad or coleslaw to start. I got the coleslaw. Lots of it, just tasted like mayonnaise & cabbage. When the country fried steaks arrived, just huge, we all got the Texas fries too. The steak were so big, almost too big to stay on the plate. Unfortunately the breading lacked any spices. We all tried salt & pepper that helped a little but ketchup is what made it better. Won't be going back. We will continue our hunt for a delicious country fried steak. Rating would have been lower but the service was very good.",

There was not a lot of excitement from the start.  I was craving a great steak and I had never been here before. The Ribeye (My favorite cut) was lacking in the quality of the beef. It tastes like grocery store Holstein and looked like it when it cooked up too. The meal covered my hunger bit I felt this place could be so much better with just a little tweeking.   The decor I loved and it screams Texas. It was fun to read the articles and see all of the hats hanging from the ceiling. As always, I may have just caught it on an off day.

The atmosphere is kitchy, which I personally don't care for, but I only go for the awesome food and friendly service. Geez, now I'm craving some prime rib!  Don't hesitate to go here for a casual dinner with some of the best Texas comfort food you'll ever have. Bring clients for lunch if they have never been, they will love it and let their guard down so you can have a productive lunch meeting. They will end up going back, bringing their spouses and thanking you for showing them this spot!",

Biscuits (basic), chicken fried steak (super tender), sunny side up eggs, and sausage gravy, all coming together into an indulgent brunch dish.  The large hunks of fried potatoes (\"Texas Fries\") were cooked through, and had a nice \"real\" potato flavor to them.  Some salt and pepper plus ketchup finished them nicely.  The pecan pie is very sweet and chewy, and the pecans are candied beautifully.  Not the biggest fan of the crust (it could be more buttery and crumbly) but overall it was very good.  The place looked clean to me, and I appreciate being able to sit at a booth during a time when they weren't super busy.  My water was never empty for too long, and the waitress did a good job.  While I'm not a fan of the decor, I do appreciate how all the flags and caps on the walls and ceiling dampen the noise level.  After being disappointed at the diners around here, I'll be back for their REAL (not frozen and re-heated) chicken fried steak/chicken and their REAL (not instant or canned)!sausage gravy.",

It had the cheap Kraft cheese barley melted on it and weird coleslaw...? Anyways, I originally tried to order chicken tenders and fries and was told by the waitress I wasn't allowed because I wasn't a child. I had a child at the table sitting right next to me?! She said the cooks wouldn't make it for me because it wasn't actually for the child it was for me.... ummm.. okay? So I end up with this crappy sand which instead.  The waitress was a little rude. The only positive was the manager he was super friendly, he seemed like a genuinely good person. I almost feel bad writing this review because he was so nice. But hopefully he will see this and make some changes! Also, the high chairs are super sketchy. It was hanging off the table by two bars, hardly secured on there. The waitress told me they can put a chair under it Incase it falls... yea, nooo thanks! I would just rather my child not fall at all! Lol",

I read some reviews that were positive about dining at Texaz Grill and drove from Anthem to try their smoked prime rib.   I arrived about 6:00 p.m. on a Sunday evening and was seated immediately. I placed my order and was served my iceberg lettuce with rhe house mustard  dressing and warm rolls & butter. So far, so good. About 15 minutes later I was served my entree. The large cut of smoked prime rib was accompanied by mashed potatoes and gravy and a dollop of horseradish sauce on rhe side. The potatoes were tasty but the prime rib ordered medium rare was inedible.  I could barely cut into it as the meat was as tough as shoe leather. I chewed and chewed and it had a subtle smoked flavor but there was so much fat and gristle that I chose to take it home.  The next day I tried to have it for lunch but threw most of it away as it was too tough to chew and swallow.  I spent $30. some dollars for a cut of smoked prime rib that was lousy.  I should have sent it back but I have to say I would not recommend the smoked prime rib and will not be coming to the Texaz Grill again.",

Fair selection of bottled beers, though none on tap.  They tend to sell out of the prime rib, but I hope to give that a try next go around.  Steak and mashed potatoes were both decent, but my oh my - the breaded pork chop was out of this world tender and juicy!  I ordered a side of cole slaw which wasn't bad, but it definitely has onions in it, which was new to me.  The service was very attentive, and the restaurant had a nice homey feel to it - not what you'd expect to find in a strip mall, but that kinda adds to the charm.",

However, a large portion of nasty, is still just nasty, regardless of how much they give you.  The Chicken Fried Steak (their pride and joy) was bland and the only flavor was grease.  I don't mean the typical \"its a fried dish\" grease flavor, no i mean it tasted like after they pulled it out of the fryer they dipped it in the oil vat.  The gravy was nondescript and flavorless.    Side options were nothing special, they seem to rave about the cole slaw, but it is not my cup of tea, so I passed.  This place seems like the type of establishment that if you are a regular then you get stellar service, if you are not, then oh well to you.  Funny, because how do people get to be a new regular if you aren't giving decent service to the new guest.  To sum it up, people swear by this place. I however, have sworn off this place.  I don't get it, I left feeling ripped off and revolted that I even ate that junk (now don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good chicken fried steak, this just was not it for sure!)",

I couldn't believe the amount of food I got once it was there.  The hot gravy on top of it, along with a side of mashed potatoes.  Amazing.    Before dinner though, they bring out fresh biscuits, which I quickly buttered up and coated with honey.    This review was based on my own dinner.  The four stars was for the chicken friend steak.  Im being generous because on the downside, the salads we got seem wilted and old.  Our waitress at times was too busy talking to people than checking to see if we were ready to order or go. My girlfriend got shish kabobs and wasn't too much of a fan.. especially after she tried my CFS.  haha.. My friend got the pork chops and it seemed too much fried food. Weird?

I like mah gravy to taste like it could be an entree of it's own like it should, not as just a topping, but that's just the fatty inside me talking.

    "text": "My boyfriend has the winning review for tonight:  \"I'd slit my wrists, but you'd never get the grease out of the upholstery.\"  Texaz is neither a steakhouse nor a diner.   It is a little piece of nostalgia for those who miss their mother's (mediocre) dinners. Portions are ridiculously over-sized, the cow is proudly \"unseasoned,\" and grease takes the place of, well... everything. It should all add up to ultimate comfort, but we left feeling full-up on drippings without any flavor to show for it. It's a McDonald's feeling. If that's your guilty pleasure, go for it. But do it on your own hung-over time. I wouldn't bring friends here.  I loved the restaurant itself. Everyone who worked there was beyond amazing. Just really good people who clearly loved the place and who wanted their guests to love it too. The kitsch was fun, the energy was upbeat and comfortable, and I appreciate any place that has such a dedicated following of regulars.  The flagship chicken fried steak had a lot going for it. It was big enough to feed a family of four, tender enough to be cut with a fork (really!), and it held up its light crispiness under the white gravy. That's a super-human feat, and it amazed me all night. On the down side, the cutlet lacked flavor, which is the whole point of a round steak. Ultimately, it was comforting, but only because it was totally expected and not notably bad.  The steak list is cut in-house (except the t-bone, I think). The menu boasts that the steaks are free of seasoning and tenderizer, so we expected the rib-eye to be full of flavor and fat. Instead, it was presented swimming in oil (shortening? flavorless drippings?) and wasn't good for anything except as a sponge for Worcestershire sauce. We sent most of it back.  Both mashed and fried potatoes were good, and the slaw was refreshing.   I know these are minor, but:  -Why does the bread basket have a single dinner roll and a single biscuit in it? -Why don't they have sweet tea? -Why is their Shiner Bock served in a 7oz glass?",

The steak was good, it didn't have a ton of flavor but the gravy that I slathered on top did.  The Prime Rib was awesome, thick, red, and juicy.

Think of soda water infused batter. They then slather the middle with a creamy and yummy white gravy. They serve it with mashed and corn with a biscuit on the side.

I of course yelped it first to decide what I was going to eat, and the response was overwhelmingly to get the Chicken Fried Steak.  Okay then.    Inside, this place is literally covered in crap.  There are business cards along the door frame and all over the ceiling.  Baseball caps literally line the entire perimeter of the room and then some.  There really isn't an inch of space that hasn't been covered with some form of Texas style memorabilia.    I got the chicken fried steak, obviously, and it came with mashed potatoes, corn, and a biscuit.  The potatoes were okay, nothin special, the corn was okay but a little peppery, the biscuit was very bland and the bottom was a bit hard, and the chicken fried steak was just ok.  I've had a few chicken fried steaks in my life, and this one did not stand out.  It was really crisp and crunchy on the outside, which I like, but flavor-wise, there was just something missing.  It was just okay.  Service was quick and efficient.  We had our meal in under 30 minutes, so that was nice I guess.  I probably won't be back, but at least I tried.",

I chased my taters, sauteed shrooms and steak down with a cold Dos XX and a Patron shot. All this with attentive and friendly service. The room reminded me of the shack Steve Martin lived in, in the beginning of The Jerk. And for this place, the license plates, posters and bric a brac that cover every corner, including the ceiling above the urinal, yes, guys get this...when you have to pee so badly, you arch your  head back with an eye rolling groan...that's how I saw the posters on the ceiling.

The service was fantastic, We had a party of seven and the wait was not bad. We had plenty of food / bread / salad before our meal. The chicken friend steak was some of the best I've ever had, and the mashed potatoes and gravy all over was excellent. This is not a hit or miss place, the steak was tasty and large. Yes it did need some steak sauce but nothing was incredibly overpriced. I don't see how people payed 25 a person ordering soda, when th fried steak was maybe 13? and the ribeye was maybe 16? Thats a expensive soda for those peeps. I would say it was worth every penny, and also it made great leftovers the next day. This place is genuine, and a good spot to hit up every other month or so. This place (contrary to others beliefs) Is a Diner, and you will notice this on the way in. I suggest you try it yourself, if your not a high roller with perfect expectations on everything, I think you will like this place.",

There's also no flavor at all in the batter.  The steaks look absolutely beautiful sitting there, raw, on the shelf.  They just don't put ANY seasoning on them so it's just a big, bland, piece of steak.  The cobbler is not made right either, it has a cake like batter instead of the crispy layer of dough it should have. Oddly enough though, I do and will continue to go back to this place every now and then.",

Ewww!! lots of noise. plenty of seniors. very busy, sometimes a lineup. not cheap for what it is. HUGE portions. simple home cooking. simple menu. very limited. salad or cole slaw with meal.  neither is particularly good.  2 dressing choices.  take it or leave it. i had the chicken fried steak.  their specialty item.  it was huge and hanging off the plate.  creamy gravy not too bad, tho it is not something i am used to eating.  meat itself was average in my opinion.  side of mashed potatoes and my daughter's home fries were also quite average and bland.   definitely worth 1 visit, something to see and experience, tho unsure you would return for the food alone.  that would be a personal decision, obviously many do.",

Since the place supposedly has great chicken fried steak, that's what I ordered. To say the portion is ginormous is an understatement. You get two of them that the size as big as your head. The breading's texture is great with a nice crunch. The steak is very tender and not dry. My only complaint would be that the food is BLAND! The breading definitely could've used some flavor or spice and so did the gravy. Odd that the steak is such huge portion but the gravy is very much skimped on. I liked it, but it definitely could use some major seasoning. Maybe they can steal it from Chili's. Even though Chili's is a chain, they have one of the best chicken fried steak I've had. Texaz grilled would've definitely got 4 stars if they seasoned the CFS.",

I asked here to go to the other end to take the rest of the orders after our side because they probably couldn't hear her over there.  She seemed to take offense to that and we all agreed that she was just plain rude.  Suffice it to say the service was mediocre at best and not deserving a tip but we left one anyway.  Sad thing is should could of made $25 more if she had just been nicer.  Now about the food, I really hoped for better but the over breaded chicken fried steak was bland and totally lacking any flavor.  The gravy was okay, nothing to write home about They serve it on this small plate which makes cutting it difficult.  The wrapped button was stuff under the roll on top of the mash potatoes which I found odd.  To top the meal off the waitress didn't even ask the mothers at the table if they wanted the free apple pie.  Will not be returning or recommending this place to anyone.",

There were 6 in our group we ordered:  3) Chicken Fried Goodness - House specialty - choice of tenderized beef steak, boneless chicken breast or boneless pork loin chop, double dipped, fried, and covered with cream gravy. Served with award winning mashed potatoes and gravy, corn and a buttermilk biscuit.  We tried all 3 meat types all the plates were great.  2) Biscuits and Gravy - Two buttermilk biscuits covered in sausage gravy. Great taste, fresh biscuits and plenty of sausage in the gravy.  1) Bacon or Sausage & Eggs - Bacon or hot country sausage patty with 2 eggs cooked to order & a biscuit.  Eggs cooked perfectly, great tasted sausage and fresh biscuit.",

    "text": "This place was horrible. We are a large Hispanic family and the way we were treated, it felt as though we were in the 1960s and the civil rights movement had just ended. The waitress who took our order was rude, every little thing we asked for seemed like the biggest problem.  But the real issue was when the second waitress came and asked my husband to scoot in closer to the table because the lady behind him couldn't sit comfortable enough - mind you, said lady stopped her and told her she was fine - but the waitress insisted that he need to move to an uncomfortable position so that the other person would be better (HE WAS ALREADY SITTING WITH HIS BODY TOCHING THE TABLE)! Absolutely rude, uncalled for, and unnecessary - as clients our needs were, clearly, of less importance - which left us wondering why? From the moment we walked in, we received nothing but attitude, especially in comparison to everyone else enjoying their meals.  The food wasn't good and even if it had any goodness in it, we didn't taste it because we were beyond upset. It was incredible that there is such an atmosphere that still exist this way - we were in shock.   The most aggravating part? We were only in Phoenix for the day - we live in TEXAS! This restaurant is the most abominable example of Texas food and hospitality, if you really want something from the Texas menu then please come and eat here, in Texas - we really are a friendly state! This restaurant, in the very least, should change their name because it was nowhere close to the Texas environment - I found it an embarrassment as a born & raised TEXAN!",

They have a kids menu, a full bar, and a hands on owner. I love to support local family owned businesses and that's what you get with TEXAZ. A great steakhouse that won't break the bank!  The only thing not great about TEXAZ is the lack of parking which can be rather tight. If you have a large truck or SUV, you don't want to park facing 16th Street, it's too tight and backing out is difficult. Park on the side of the building facing Bethany Home Rd., or in the back where large vehicles can get in and out with ease.",

My friend wanted the prime rib but it was out, so he got a rib eye which he did not like, (probably because he's not really a steak eater, he said). The owner came to check on us and when he heard that, he suggested we exchange it for a 'small' CFS. I guess 'small' in Texaz means HUGE! It covered the plate and came with some delicious gravy. I'd say that was the best ever CFS. My dinner was the filet which was excellent, big and cooked perfectly.  We also had the shrimp cocktail which was wonderful too. We split the peach cobbler ala mode, which was the perfect end to my friend's birthday dinner. Prices were fair and our server was Great!  Whenever I am in the Phoenix area I will be sure to come back to Texaz Grill. I wish we had a place like this near Chicago.",

We waited until our very last night in the area to try Texaz, and boy, are we glad we didn't miss it. There were four of us, and we all ordered the chicken fried steak. Being a native Texan, I had to compare it to the unofficial state dish of Texas. It was hands-down the BEST I've ever eaten, and even the \"small\" portion was huge! The waitstaff is very friendly, and the super nice owner, Steve, came out of the kitchen to visit with us. It was a very enjoyable evening, and we will definitely go again when we're back in Phoenix.",

Just a fun old Texas steakhouse right here in the heart of Uptown Phoenix. All kinds of crazy crap on the walls, great service, and awesome grub.  I get that parking in there is a pain but there are plenty of open spaces across Bethany on the SE corner of the intersection. When you consider how far people walk when they have to park, for example, downtown or at the Biltmore -- TEXAZ is probably actually a shorter walk from your vehicle. Just a point is all.  Anyways, the bartender (whose name I can't recall - shucks) was great. I told her it was my first time and she walked me through the menu and highlighted the chicken fried steak (their specialty) and the prime rib. I ordered the large prime rib and it was excellent. I have also tried the chicken fried steak and, while rich, it's also very good. Just all around, nothing but good things to say about TEXAZ Grill.  Plus you get little glasses for your beer. What a novelty.",

Heavy deep fried huge portions. As the other reviews they are known for the chicken fried steak.. it's huge deep fried and actually I wasn't that impressed it was chewy and tuff to eat.  I think my sides were just a basic iceberg lettuce salad mashed potatoes and something else I honestly don't remember. My husband had The prime rib and it was super greasy tasteless. Our son had typical corndogs.. I like food with flavor colorful not call plan one color greasy food.",

When did that change happen??? Asked for no sides bread or salad with the $27 filet, wanted green beans and onions instead - no problem for an additional charge of $7.00 - without being told that that's what they were going to do. Onions and green beans instead potatoes and salad - really need to charge for that? So so disappointed- will not be back.",

I don't usually care for brisket and this reminded me why, pretty much like eating to thickly sliced smoked rubber on dried out roll that had become soggy from the meat. There is little or no sauce on it and when I asked for it they literally brought me a coffee cup half full of very runny nearly tasteless red liquid. I also had a salad that I was told had olives on it but it was actually smothered in chopped green olives and I though wow if I had asked for no olives it would have been nothing but a plate of lettuce. So If you want to go to a seedy dive bar and some times I do then this is the place for you. But I don't imagine you'll see me there.",

    "text": "I spoke to two managers and the owner about making a reservation for Father's Day and was declined. My dad is at the Veteran's Home and requested a steak for Father's Day. Looking at available options and reviews, I chose TEXAZ based on reviews, proximity and the fact it was locally owned.   Because my Dad is in a wheelchair and my mother's vehicle will not accommodate a wheelchair, we must make transportation arrangements days in advance. It is not possible to do anything \"on the fly\" under his current circumstances, therefore a reservation is paramount. This was explained in detail to the manager and the owner.   I was told by the manager (Derek) that reservations were only for parties of six or more and that they couldn't take up a table (which would be needed for a man in a wheelchair) on the busiest day of their year.   The owner, passed me to the manager to explain the situation saying he was sure it would be ok.   That this situation (Dad in a wheelchair - hopefully, temporarily) would result in being declined a reservation for \"taking up too much space at a table\" on Father's Day floors me. We have been fortunate not to need to take up \"too much space\" historically, I had no idea that businesses would be so unaccommodating to a 82 year old Purple Heart veteran in a wheelchair. Neither Texas nor Arizona (TexAZ) have a reputation for treating those who have served so poorly.",

You'll get a reasonably priced, delectably tender portion of your favorite cut of meat. Their mashed & baked potatoes are good, so is the coleslaw. Salads are lackluster, mostly iceberg lettuce, cardboard-like tomatoes, served as a vehicle for the dressing. But you don't go to TexAZ for rabbit food, you go for meat. And Texas beer.   Best steak within 20 miles.   Used to be the best deal around, too, but as of mid-2008, prices have been raised - plan on $20+ per person if you want a meal and a beer, $14-17 per person if you just drink water.",

People complaining about the price need to get out more, because you will not find better prices than these for anywhere near the quality or quantity.  Go early if you want the prime rib; we got there before 5:30 on a Thursday and they were nearly out.  They have happy hour on weeknights with half-price drinks, I had 2 glasses of  Mondavi red wine for a grand total of 4 measly bucks to wash down the prime rib with.

    "text": "This is one of those places I've had on my list for a long time. Finally, today a co-worker and I headed up there for lunch.   The parking at lunch is a little nightmarish. I finally squeezed into a space though and we went inside.  The decor has already been described by other reviewers--it's someone's idea of what a Texas themed restaurant should look like, with all sorts of license plates and other crap hung up on the walls. The inside is much smaller than I imagined it would be, but we were seated quickly by a friendly hostess so I can't complain about that.   We both had the chicken fried steak, which we had heard so much about. I thought it was okay. Not great, certainly not bad, but not really living up to the hype either. I loved the potatoes and gravy, though I have rarely met a mashed potato I didn't like. The corn was okay, and the biscuit was nothing great. That said, the price was good--$7.00 I think, and the portions were big. The service was friendly and fast.   If I worked closer to this place I would go for lunch from time to time. As it is now, I'll probably try it again to see how the barbecue rates, but that's about it. I wanted to like it better, and it was okay, but nothing special.",

    "text": "i was recommended to this place by a friend of mine who said he hadn't been here in awhile but thought it was great last time he was there. i really wish i didn't listen to him.  when my girlfriend i entered the building the first sign of this place sucking was probably the empty dining room, but it was around 8:30 so that i can understand. what i cannot understand and what was such a disappointment, was the food.   I ordered the rib-eye which on the menu said it was \"Jim's special\", which wasn't so special at all but ill get into that in a minute, my girlfriend ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer and  the brisket sand which as her entree. now, for 6 bucks i expect more than 4 tiny shrimp, but it was good so that still gets my OK.   what doesn't get my OK was the steak. my rib-eye, which was like 18 bucks, a reasonable price for a reasonable sized steak, was probably smaller than a hamburger patty and was well done when i ordered it medium. the mashed potatoes as my side i ordered double of which i wish i didn't, because it was more like double gravy, single mashed potatoes. the gravy itself tasted like it was pure lard, and i was unable to even eat it because it was just so heavy. I'm a bigger guy, i like fattening food, but that was just gross to me. my girlfriends food wasn't that much better.   when the bill came around, it was 48 bucks, which is what i left with no tip because the service was equally terrible, she was rude and acted like she wanted us gone. i have NEVER not left a tip.   i know this place has a great reputation, and that's what got me in there, but when i left i was honestly impressed by how bad that was. i almost want to call my friend that suggested this place to me and tell him he owes me 50 bucks.   not worth it, never coming back here again.",

The decor is very unique and not like something you have seen before if raised in phoenix. The place is always packed I've never seen it not busy. Very welcoming staff as well. They serve the best home style cooked delicious food. I usually always get their specialty the chicken fried steak. It's defiantly my favorite and the main reason I keep coming back. It's a huge helping, almost falling off the plate because it's so big and you get 2 pieces with 2 sides! They also have great BBQ, fried foods, deserts, a great wine and beer list, and so much more. If you haven't tried texaz grill you must go!",

    "text": "Hmmmm.... Think I Would Rather Suck Down Your Colonoscopy Bag?  If you are truly looking for a unique dining experience accompanied with old world business cards and lifeless animals, then you will need to try out Texaz Grill all for yourself. If you are looking for good food, solid service, and a nice atmosphere, then you probably want to avoid this strip mall hangout at all costs. If you love low-quality food, poor service, and a revolting atmosphere, then you need to steer your lifted F350 right on over to Texaz Grill.  Wow, from the moment we walked in I knew we were in for trouble ... I just didn't think it could be as bad as it actually was. This is one establishment that will leave you wondering whether the city of Phoenix mandates any sort of cleanliness or health standards. This place is dirty, vile, unkempt, and this is way before we even met our server or received our food.  Just 7:30 PM on a Thursday night, but you would have thought this place was closing up shop for the night or permanently (which wouldn't be a bad thing). Guests are sparse and the few who do remain look like they have chain smoked all of taste buds right out of their mouths. The servers give you the impression they are NOT working for tips and really make no attempt at ensuring a pleasant guest experience. The inside will remind you of a cross between a real, small town BBQ joint and a TGIFridays minus the corporate cleanliness standards. The booths are ancient, uncomfortable, and anything but clean. The walls are littered with business cards, dead animals, used hats, and license plate frames. You will want to write off all the dirt and disaster on the wall as good old Texas charm, but you will quickly realize your appetite fades as each minute passes you by.  So we arrive at our booth and are quickly greeted by our degenerate server who you would have thought was being paid by number of tables she turned over per night. She doesn't look like she wants to be there, and, frankly, neither do we. Our drinks are brought out in a timely fashion, and then she did the best she could to get us to order a quickly as possible. And, we're off....  Orders are put in for a Chicken Fried Steak and the Thursday night BBQ sampler. Our server had to check that there were any of the BBQ samplers left which should tell you that this combination was probably made yesterday and has been hanging around all day. The salad came quick - too quick. Within two minutes of ordering, I had the misfortune of choking down a brown, bland, and boring salad. Of course, nobody goes to a BBQ joint for a salad, but I think most prefer green lettuce and more than two dressing choices.  Not even ten minutes later and our entrees had arrived, and we suddenly had enough food to feed an entire homeless shelter but I have my doubts of them even touching this piss poor attempt at Texas BBQ.  Chicken Fried Steak - imagine about 1oz of beef shankle meat breaded in a pound of breading and smothered in some alien gravy. The meat was bland, veiny, chewy, and not even good enough for my neighbor's dog. You get two of them and each one will be bigger than your head, but I'm not really sure what you are supposed to do with them because they are anything but edible.  BBQ Sampler - I would have rather have sampled what was soaked up in the dirty bar rag or growing out of the rug. The ribs were too fatty and smothered in the generic BBQ sauce that made this place famous. The brisket was boring and overcooked. The Texas fries were not fries, nor were they good. The sausage was edible, but more so in a comparative way. Even the bread was terrible.   The food can be summed up as atrocious, inedible, poor quality, and even hard to look at. Truly some of the worst food I have ever eaten or looked at in my entire life. The highlight of the night was easily when our server seemed astonished we refused the to-go box. Sorry, but you should have been shaking our hands for even trying to make a meal out of those make-me-want-to-go-vegetarian plates of meat.   It is worth mentioning that Texas Grill does two things and two things only correctly. You will be seated quickly to ensure that the dead animals or the plethora of 1970s business cards stapled to the walls don't scare you away and the plastic soft drink mugs are gigantic, but I'm sure this was implemented to minimize server interaction with the tables.  Go grab a McRib or two before you throw away any money at this place...or be ready to pop some serious laxatives. Outside of some rough drinking nights, I have never felt the urge to vomit all over the place 15 hours after a meal. Good luck to you if you choose this place. If you do decide to go, don't forget to bring your business card - it might be old enough to go up on the wall in 2032 - that is, assuming this place is around much longer.",

    "text": "This food is amazing! It's heavy but so delicious! I love chicken fried anything from here. The brisket is also so good. The Gravy is awesome. Most white gravy doesn't have a super strong taste but its definitely not bland like others have said. The best part are the lunch prices! $8 for a huge piece of chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes , corn and a biscuit! They even have lunch prices on Saturday. Yes it's cluttered but I don't rate based on decor unless its dirty which is a different story. It doesn't bother me but like I said I'm not the type of person who lets decor decide if I will return or not. The service varies, sometimes its awesome sometimes it's so so. I've never had bad service here. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was there ribeye because they dot use tenderizers or seasoning which I love but other than that it wasn't bad, I just prefer my steak seasoned and tenderized.",

I perused the menu, but already knew I was going for the go-to dish. we also started with an order of the fried okra. Wifey got the special, which was chicken and dumplings. Little man ordered a cheeseburger. The okra was awesome! tender, perfectly seasoned and just the way fried okra should be. My chicken fried steak was HUGE, like the size of my face. Now bigger isn't always better. The steak was just okay. Somehow with all the gravy, it ws pretty bland. The steak part tasted more like liver and the breading was a bit doughy. I wasn't blown away by my meal but it doesn't matter, it was still a good experience. the service was great, prices cheap and we didn't have to drive very far. Will I go back? probably not, but definitely glad we finally checked it out.",

    "text": "Living in New York city for so many years I would chuckle over tourists. Just standing abruptly in utter fascination, usually in the middle of the sidewalk, blocking commutes in Times Square. In the office we would chalk it up to visual overload.   So when I walked into TEXAZ Grill and behaved similarly I laughed at myself. Opening the doors to this restaurant was unbelievable. Memorabilia from the Great State of Texas. Covers. Every. Square. Inch.    Neon lights greeted me.  \"Texas!\" (Also neon shapes of Texas were everywhere.) An old school juke box. Beer signs galore. Guitars hanging. A giant gull head. Horns. John Wayne behind the bar. \"Happy Birthday Texas!\" The best collection of inappropriate stickers *ever*. License plates of every state covered the bar. The collection has been cultivated over 28 years by the the owner and patrons. (Tip: When you go, feel free to bring stuff in!)  Anyhoo, stuff. My eyeballs were full. Finally I made it to the bar and met Tammy. (A hoot who has worked here 18 years!) After inquiring where I was from, a peppy response, \"Well, welcome to Texas!\" (And so I fell in love with this place. Before food even factored into the equation.)  ENTREES So the food... A tad concerned there wouldn't be a healthy option to consume I was incredibly wrong. (Plenty of non-fried options!) The ribeye steak was to die for. (Perhaps the mashed potatoes with gravy were necessary to consume. But I just had to try them!)   The meat was prepared to the exact pinkness level requested. I can't even describe the level of food happiness that transpired that night. The meat was just so tender. I had made the mistake of noshing on the spicy hot peanuts available on the bar, as well as eating my way thru the delightfully prepared coleslaw that accompanied the meal.  Amateur hour. Yes, definitely eat the coleslaw. It was flavorful and not too heavy in mayo. (Or try the salad with the blue cheese. Wonderful chunks of cheese.) But leave space for your meal!  As I wasn't dining solo I had the opportunity to sample a burger. Holy bejeebers. This isn't a frou frou burger. This is a simply prepared burger, sans grease, on a beautiful bun with high quality meat.   DESSERT We earned a bread pudding! One second and I'll explain how. Tough decision as to what to pick but we went with the french bread in an egg custard with toasted pecans & raisins. Why? It was topped with a bourbon sauce! Dense and delicious. Served as described. Warm. Mmm mmm mmm! Biggest scoop of ice cream too!  CLEAN PLATE CLUB Clean you plate at lunch and get one punch. Two punches for dinner. EIGHT punches equals ONE dessert! How sweet is that? :)  HH Mon-Thur 3-6pm 1/2 bottled beer Wine by the glass All well drinks  As they say there \"It doesn't get any better kids!\"  We loved sitting at the bar for dinner! Great experience!",

    "text": "Boyfriend and I were in the hunt for the perfect steak as I am a carnivore, and this place has it! Since finding this gem we have gone back every Friday with no fail! To the point that we made a very special friend named Susan. She is hands down the best server. She knows our orders like the back of her hand which makes our dining experience extra special and convenient. She's very attentive and friendly. We always ask for her!   As for that steak I was mentioning.. it is to no surprise that it's their smoked prime rib. I've been to plenty and I mean PLENTY of restaurants and none of them can compare to the flavor, the size for the price and the tenderness! The sides are also amazing like their mashed potatoes and the new mac and cheese. Yum!  The boyfriend have always enjoyed their battered cod and Texas fries.   All in all this restaurant has a nice and friendly vibe from the decors to the servers and of course the superb food. Two thumbs up!",

I'm a purist so I used to order the chicken fried steak but have since broadened my horizons and have started ordering the chicken fried chicken which is, in my opinion, better. I also really appreciate the fact that they started offering half orders because their regular portion sizes are ginormous (though the leftovers are also delicious).   This is probably one of my more boring reviews because I don't have anything to snark about with Texaz.  I actually joined their email list just because they seem like nice people and I'd like to hear from them more often.  Their food also cures all hangovers and it is the absolute perfect place to go on Sunday night after a long weekend of liver damage in Vegas (learned this last weekend). Five Stars.",

Maybe it's just my taste buds that have changed, or maybe it's because it's under new ownership which probably means new cooks and new standards.  Judging from a few of the other reviews, perhaps I'm not alone in my lack of enthusiasm.   Everything was cooked well and nothing was burnt, but I was expecting more of a kick from the dishes, I guess. My wife actually loved her pork chops, finding them juicy and nicely done. But, she did admit that the southern fried pork chops she makes have a zestier batter with more black and cayenne pepper. My catfish was rather plain, however, and I wasn't a fan of the potatoes. I was expecting fries and out came these weird potato hunks with no flavor.   Oh, and the salads, the salads were these pale dishes of ice-berg lettuce. I love salad, but I couldn't finish it.   As with other visitors at this place, we also hated the parking, but I was not surprised at that.   In the words of Marvin Martian: Where's the Kaboom? There's supposed to be an Earth Shattering Kaboom!  The must have put it where they hid the pepper shakers.",

Service was good can't complain and when we were ordering I decided to go big or go home (chicken fried steak) when our server asked if I wanted a full order or a half order I was like \"pssssh I'm a grown man give me a full!\" OMG when it came out it was an unassuming huge piece of CFS with delicious gravy and flavorful potatoes and I wasn't paying attention until my friend looked over and said \"there is another huge piece under that one\" upon inspection I had an entire meal under my meal = full order.

The majority of us ordered our usual chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and corn topped with a biscuit. My son opted for a cheese burger and fries, talk about playing it safe.   The chicken fried steaks, while heavy on the breading, did not disappoint. A slight crackle was present when cutting the steak with my fork. The potatoes I thoroughly enjoyed. Skin on mashed are my fav. Slightly chunky provided enough proof they were actual potatoes and not some powdered imposter. The corn, well, it was corn.   I blinked twice and my sons burger was gone. So no complaints there I guess. All in all, the quality remains the same while noticing a slight increase in prices in some items.   One drawback was we noticed the complimentary pre meal donut thingies were no longer.  That might have pushed this review over the top.",

    "text": "I think this is our third time here.  We know a few people who always rave about this place, and we keep thinking maybe it will get better.  Maybe we were there on an off night.  But I must conclude after this visit that this isn't really the case.  Some folks clearly do love it, but I am totally underwhelmed.  Our table this time ordered the southern pork chop, chicken fried steak, chicken fried chicken, and smoked prime rib.  Some of this we had previously, some was new.   First the chicken-fried steak.  I believe I commented last time that it was mostly breading, and not very flavorful.  That is still the case.  Without the gravy it has no flavor at all.  I would expect some from the breading, but it just wasn't there.  Denny's makes a better one.  I am not kidding.  The southern pork chop is basically a chicken-fried pork chop.  This one was pretty good because there was more meat than breading, and so I could taste the pork.  The breading and gravy worked well with it, but it was still lacking any real flavor to distinguish it from other restaurants.  The chicken-fried chicken was similar to the pork.  More meat, and you could taste the meat, but the \"chicken-fried\" aspect is totally lacking.  The smoked prime rib was easily the best dish we ordered.  The au jus was a bit salty, but it was a very smoky and flavorful hunk of meat.  Portions are reasonably large, though for some reason they have reduced the size of their plates.  We compared to our old photos and it was obvious.  Seems silly to me to cram the same amount of food onto a smaller plate.  The \"fries\" were actually large chunks of potato that were not seasoned in any way.  The outer bit was fried, but the rest was like a baked potato.  The mashed potatoes were just mashed.  No garlic or anything.  The cajun seasoning on the table helps.  And the salads were not very popular among those who ordered them.   So all in all a very expensive, and very disappointing dining experience.  We have their punch cards, and they're half full.  But we have no plan to return and so will likely just toss the cards in the trash.",

I started with a house salad...nothing special but was a nice serving. The lettuce was crisp and it had ample tomatoes. Next was the chicken fried steak that was breaded perfect and a very large portion. It was served with real mashed potatoes and everything was covered in white cream gravy.   I felt like I was in my hometown enjoying a lifetime favorite meal!    I'll definitely be back if ever in the area again.",

The Ribeye is a great alternative to the prime rib. A good sear and nice marbling makes this steak juicy and delicious as well.  Service was fast and friendly everytime too.  This is now a regular stop for us, especially when out of town guests want to hit some place local.",

Huge drink portions for both alcoholic and ice teas.    The average:  The steaks and prime rib are on par with sizzler.  No worse no better.   If I need steak sauce it's never better than average.    The rib eye I had was a thin cut, which is hard to cook medium so I had to return it because it was cooked well.  No big deal they handled beautifully.   The biscuit and wheat bun were standard fair and neither were warm. I do like it when a place drops free bread on your table regardless.   The bad:  The salad.    Awful.  Wilted lettuce is the worst.   Also it was drowned in dressing.  I couldn't eat it  So here's the scoop.  I would eat here again, for a hamburger and fries.  The atmosphere and wait staff were great. We had Mary and she was on point with refills and checking in.  Plus we had a two year old and she was great.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to trying this place for a long time.  The reviews on Yelp were good and I was told by a fellow steak lover that if I wanted a great (not the best) cut of steak at a reasonable price, then Texaz is the place to go.  I went on a Thursday evening and the place was pretty busy.  I was seated right away by a very friendly hostess.  You could tell from the looks of the place that it had been around a while.  I could have sworn my booth was going to fall apart, but it was ok.  The decor is a bit eccentric with anything and everything having to do with Texas all over the walls.  All the patrons seemed to be having a good time and enjoying their meals.  There were also plenty of wait staff bustling around.  While everything on the menu sounded delicious (but NOT diet friendly), I opted for the filet.  Next time I am going to order the prime rib or the chicken friend steak because I hear those are excellent.  My salad came quickly and was very good.  However, it was a bit odd because it contained diced green olives (which I normally don't like), but I said what the heck and ate it all anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised.  When the steak arrived I was surprised again at the size.  I was expecting it to be much smaller but it was a pretty big cut.  I'm guessing around 8-10oz.  I love it when steaks are cooked in plenty of butter (gross to some people...I know) and I guess this place knew that because there was plenty of the hot, melty goodness all over the steak and plate!  It was soooo good but soooo unhealthy.  It was cooked perfectly and I ate every bite.  The potatoes were just ok but I ate them anyway.  Nothing a bunch of salt and ketchup couldn't fix.  For dessert I ordered the homemade pecan pie and it was probably among the best I have ever had.  If you are looking for an upscale steak/bbq joint then this is NOT the place for you.  If you are looking for place with some good meat with good prices and excellent service, then this is the place for you.",

    "text": "To start with, I'm a Texan, born and raised. I've done my share of traveling and I've lived in other places. Being new to the Phoenix area, naturally I'm always looking for comforts that remind me of Texas. I'll often be seen wearing my Longhorns or Astros caps.  I love food! I love Tex-Mex, BBQ and southern style cookin'. So I passed the Texaz Grill several times before I had an opportunity to stop in. The first time I ever stumbled upon it, I got so excited because of the name and the neon signs adorning the windows, Shiner Baby!  When I did stop in, I was in awe, not because it felt like home but because of all the things hanging on the ceiling and the walls and because of the neons inside. Everything in this place has something to do with Texas. Sweet! And they sell Shiner Bock beer!  I knocked off a couple stars because of pricing, variety and the service we got. We were seated promptly but it was pretty much downhill after that. I looked over the menu, which took about a half minute, and was shocked that they didn't even have a hamburger on it. I'd say don't go here unless you're supa dupa hungry because you're going to have to order a steak of some sort or fish or maybe pork chops (I don't remember). I wasn't starving, that's my point. And I'm not even a fan of chicken fried steak but I know a good one when I eat one and it's definitely a True test of a \"Texas\" style restaurant. So I order the chicken fried steak. It was very good, just what you would find at your favorite down home restaurant anywhere in Texas. It came with what they call steak fries, but they were really just big cubes of potatoes. I thought they were kinda weird and bland. You get a large portion of food, very large actually. But it seemed a bit steep, maybe I'm just cheap. Either way, I did enjoy a bottle of Shiner and the place was decent and novel enough that I will go back, if for no other reason than to sit at the bar and have a beverage. Maybe I'll run into some fellow Texans and I can share with them my wonderful experiences in this great city of Phoenix.",

The gravy is wonderful, not pasty and paired with your choice of mashed potatoes or their own version of fries.  He loves the mashed potatoes.  I don't care for the fries. They're good tasting chunks of potato but don't resemble fries AT ALL.  Their burger is decent but the I don't like their club sandwiches.  They used good ingredients but instead of the traditional bread in layers its all just on a french roll bun.  Last time I got the Chicken Fried Chicken sandwich and enjoyed it.  Again the burger bun its on is sufficient but for a great piece of chicken like that better buns would help.  I loved the Bread Pudding in Whiskey Sauce for dessert.  We've always gotten the same waitress and have loved her.  She's pleasant, helpful and has a great attitude.",

Most everyone at the table wasn't that happy with the food - the ribs that someone had were particularly lackluster. I ordered one of the early bird specials, a small NY with a cheese enchilada and thought it was pretty good - but at $9.50 my expectations were not real high. The service was just OK _ I had to get up to ask someone for bread plates, as we didn't have any. The biscuits (which used to be awesome) were kind of cold and hard. I'd go back one more time for sure, because my favorite is their Chicken Fried Chicken, but as I didn't order that, I would have to try it one more time before I crossed this place off of my list...it really did used to be great food with great service, but this last time, it really was just decent food with acceptable service.",

I have driven by this place for years and everyone I have talk to said its great. Not sure why it took me so long to eat here but I will go here every time I'm in the mood for chicken fried steak. The place has a small menu other then that its your average bar. Dart boards, bar, tables, restrooms, but they have freakin UNREAL CHICKEN FRIED STEAK. My girlfriend got the chicken friend chicken and it was good, and it was a huge portion as well but its not as good as the steak. Either one of these dishes can feed two people easily. There was nothing else on the menu I would go back for which is kind of good cause when I go here I already know what I'm getting. They have thousand of business cards that customers have placed all over the walls and celling. Looks cool, but this place could use a dusting! 3 stars but they get a 4th for that Chicken Fried Steak!",

Got the smoked brisket sandwich with texaz fries and hubs got chicken fried steak & fries, kids got chicken fingers & grilled cheese. We finished off with the bread pudding. The brisket had a good flavor, wish it had more smoke ring and more sauce, but that's just a preference. Hubs chicken fried steak was amazing. We both tried our daughters mashed potatoes & wished we got those! The texaz fries were also great, but the mashed were amazing. And the chicken tenders were real chicken, hand dipped & fried. Definitely good breeding a and biscuits, totally homemade. For anyone wanting Texas comfort food, I would recommend it. The service was wonderful also. Wish the hats weren't dusty, Rhys my only gripe. Dusty hats hanging over my food doesn't say yum. But, sit in the middle of the restaurant and it won't bother you.",

First, it was a Saturday night at 7 p.m and the place was nearly empty.  My New York strip steak was bland. The fried potatoes are huge, plain and flavorless - no seasoning whatsoever. Everyone else thought their prime rib and steaks were boring and average. The martinis? Microscopic. Hanny's style. I couldn't decide which were smaller. Hanny's or Texaz?  I think the three stars I'm giving is really generous, but the atmosphere here rocks (you find something new on the wall every time) and our server had an awesome attitude and handled our 7 person party professionally.

    "text": "My old man always said if you wanted to get rich you'd buy a Texan for what he was worth and sell him for what he thought he was worth. That about summarizes my feelings about TexAZ Grill. This is the most overrated place I've been to in a while.   I'd never been to TexAZ before today because I always seem to crave chicken fried steak for breakfast, and the place doesn't open until 11:00 a.m. Well, today I was craving chicken fried steak for lunch, so I thought I'd try out TexAZ out.   The size of the chicken fried steak is enormous, there's no denying that; but that's where the goodness ends. Sometimes quantity has a quality all its own, but not here. Let's face it: chicken fried steak is a vehicle for gravy. Even though the TexAZ steak was big enough to feed four hungry lumberjacks, they really skimped on the gravy. Even worse, both the gravy and the steak were bland, without a hint of identifiable spice. I kept eying the numerous condiments on the table while wondering if maybe adding them to the meal would make it easier to eat. The sides that accompanied the meal let me down too. The biscuit is more like a roll, and didn't flake as a biscuit should; the corn seemed like it might have come right out of a can; and I don't remember much about my mashed potatoes.   In summary: \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" In fact, I enjoy the chicken fried steak at the JB's on 19th Ave. and Missouri more than the one here. I won't be returning.",

Sadly the food was terrible. I don't understand actually having a disclaimer on your menu that you don't season your meat?! However that would explain the ridiculous amount of condiments at the table. I ordered the chicken fried steak and was saaaaaadddly disappointed. It is NOT authentic to not season this dish. It literally tasted like a cube steak dipped in a flour/water paste then deep fried. No self-respecting Texan would do this, and you certainly wouldn't add pepporcini pepper sauce or Cholula sauce to a real CFS!  The meat was not the only thing unseasoned, the chicken tenders, potatoes, biscuits and pretty much everything else was tasteless and so bad I couldn't eat it and I LOOOOVE anything fried, so this is pretty bad. We actually felt kind of bad for them when they saw how much food was on the table and we didn't want a take home box.     I advise they add salt & pepper at the least.",

The Catfish is always fresh  and  Fabulous, the crisp batter is like no other, and the fish is flakey and YUM YUM!!!!!.  The chichen fried steak, is no joke, enough for two and just AWESOME,tender and tastey served with mashed potatoes/gravy and homemade biscuits, the kind of stuff that sticks to your ribs, you will not go home hungery, that is for sure.

I'd still drive 40 miles to go to Texaz Grill.  The fillet is wonderful (sometimes I get it without the butter).

    "text": "We used to live within walking distance of Texaz Grill back in the late 90's.  We pretty much O.D.'ed on the place.  Yeah, it's that good.  What some might call, \"A heart attack on a plate\", I call \"Redneck Paradise\" (minus the boots, Bermuda shorts, wife beater tee, and cowboy hat, of course).  Texaz grill serves the best Chicken Fried Steak and Chicken Fried Chicken I've ever had.  Be forewarned though.  If you come, bring your appetite.  If you leave Texaz hungry, it's your own fault.    The portion sizes are more than generous; I think \"Obscene\" is more accurate.  The mashed potatoes are mashed with the skins on and smothered in thick white gravy, as was my chicken.  The corn niblets are nice and buttery and the chicken was nice and crispy.  My co-workers had the chicken fried steak and the steak was larger than the plate.  You also get a biscuit, although I'd prefer a roll, I just forgot to ask.  The Chicken Fried Steak and Chicken were both $7.00 and the Iced Tea was $2.00.  I feel it's a pretty fair deal for lunch.  The Texas and Arizona memorabilia that adorn the walls and ceiling are fitting for this place.  I remember when you could smoke in restaurants and it was very smokey too.  I'm so glad the smoking ban passed.  I've heard the place can get busy for lunch, so we went early and didn't have any problems finding parking and we were seated right away and served promptly.  Texaz Grill gets 5 stars in my book and I'm sure they'd appreciate it if you left the Bermuda shorts at home and come fully clothed.  Now for that angioplasty...",

    "text": "So I read about this Texaz place having great Chicken fried steak. My partner loves some of that! I really shouldn't eat it and it's where? Close to home. How much do we have to pay for it? $7 maybe less.  Really?   The place does look divey and we might not have tried it without Yelp. Got a parking place right up near the door, sauntered into the Texaz . Noted the armadillos and horned toads scaling the ceiling, the hats, the bric a brac, the country music, the beer signs. More condiments on the table than I'm used to. Lea and Perrins, Heinz 57 Steak Sauce, A-1, Ketchup, mustard, Tabasco, another hot sauce, jar of chili's, Sugar pourer, salt, pepper, and a caddy of pink sugar packets.   The waitress was right on cue, with menu and kid menu, a cup of crayons and no rush. Drinks came immediately. We ordered some chili frito's (in the bag) a chicken fried chicken, a chicken fried steak and a pork chop all with mashed potatoes, corn and white gravy and totally tasty biscuit.  Frito-bag chili came out first and was yummy, we all shared. Dinner came just as our bag o' chili was gone. It was hot and ready. My partner absolutely loved the gigantic chicken fried steak, my chicken was moist and all white meat juicy. The corn had that roasted buttery flavor I adore. The drinks never languished. The server was always available but never invading our space. Pacing and food and price couldn't be beat. Those were very good mashed potatoes! No one had any leftovers to take home. My daughter even ate almost every bite and she had ordered an adult meal!  It was too late when I noticed the oyster po'boy special... shoot! I'll have to come back. And then I'll have to come back again because with three steak sauce choices maybe I should have bought a steak? There is an ad on the table that they serve the cheapest steak for your money. I have to know if it's tasty and not just cheap.  Couldn't leave without  a dessert. We also couldn't pick between pecan pie and bread pudding so we left it up to our server. She brought us out  a 3 1/2 inch square of very hot sweet, drenched in sauce bread pudding. Very Yummy!  Our bill was light and our tummies were heavy and we left with a five star feeling. However I had to remove a star because an hour after we ate we both suffered some gastric distress and frequent visits to our private bathroom. I still will return, because it can happen anywhere and there was a lot of dairy in that gravy and in the potatoes, so it's partly our fault, but I had to mention it to be fair in the review.  Still...If what you are seeking is down home food, not counting the calories or concerned about the cholesterol, just come on in and eat it up! It's some tasty Texaz.  Update: Went for dinner this time, and the service wasn't near as good, prices were much higher than food value and as such it wasn't worth the bill price. We know now that you should order the specials, those are generally good deals and come at lunch. The mashed potato was still stellar but the gravy was too thick to move. My Prime Rib was +30% fat and that left me with a much smaller portion than I expected. My partners steak DID need the steak sauces, so it's not that they have fabulous NY strip. Docked one star off my original 4 star rating. Come if you want hearty lunch foods though, then it's worth it.",

Everything is right about this dish - the steak is so tender and the crust so crispy - and the gravy - well, Grandma would be envious!!!",

    "text": "Flavorless and greasy. Those two words pretty much sum up my dining experience here. I felt the menu was fairly limited, but hey, I usually ding places for having too many menu items as well. So I went with it under the assumption that a limited menu should mean that every item would be perfected. With that being said, I did notice some type of disclaimer at the bottom of the menu. I wish I would have read it more closely. It mentioned something about that they don't use any seasoning on their meat (wth?). I should have taken this to mean that they don't season any of their food. Also another give away to that fact would be the vast array of condiments available on each and every table. If food is prepared correctly, I shouldn't have to smother it in salt, pepper, hot sauce, steak sauce, worchestershire sauce, or any of the other various condiments offered.   But anyway, I ordered the Steak Lin Sue which was the special on Saturday night. It's a NY Strip topped with 2 artichoke hearts and 2 jumbo shrimp and covered in bearnaise sauce. It was also served with a salad and mashed potatoes with gravy. The salad consisted of  wilted iceberg lettuce, a few chopped tomatoes and olives, all smothered in ranch dressing. (They only have two dressings available: ranch or honey mustard, another wth?).    The menu said I had a \"choice of potato\" but that means either mashed potatoes or french fries (no baked potatoes at a \"steak house\" - yet another wth?) The bread that was brought was a single bland biscuit and a stale wheat dinner roll.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were both very bland and lacking flavor. I had to put hot sauce on them to eat even a few bites.   The one positive out of the experience was that they seem to cook their steaks well - meaning that the doneness seems to be consistent with what was ordered. So many places do not do this well, and the steak comes out either over or under cooked. This one was a perfect medium-rare and my date's was a perfect medium-well.  Too bad it was un-flavorful (as one would expect when cooked with no seasoning). However, once covered in A1 it was definitely edible and cooked well (just wish they would at least use basic salt/pepper on them). The Bearnaise sauce which my dish was smothered in was way too greasy and sweet (It's not supposed to be sweet.  Why was it so sweet?). I scraped it off as much as possible and ate the artichoke hearts (which unfortunately picked up much of the sweet greasy \"Bearnaise\" flavor) and ate the jumbo shrimp which would have been good if not soaked in the sweet Bearnaise. This dish was $22. I felt it was a bit overpriced compared to the other items on the menu. This should be $20 or under.  Oh, we ordered two beers (they only have bottles apparently) and the waitress brought us the two tiniest glasses you have ever seen. This is not really a complaint, just thought it was amusing as it seemed as if we were having shots of beer.   I can only imagine that with the food that we received, that the CFS would be equally bland since after all they don't season the meat and the gravy had little flavor. I would not choose to return to this restaurant on my own, but would go as a part of a group who had decided up on it (after I try to talk them into something else, lol).",

    "text": "I don't why I wanted to come so bad, because I'm not generally into chicken fried steak, but sometimes you get a craving, ya know? Finally, we had a chance and took the family. This place is at the corner of 16th St and Bethany Home and the parking lot can be slightly awkward. I think we went on a Thurs night and they had dinner chicken and dumplings ($10) for one of the daily specials. I REALLY wanted chicken fried steak ($12.50) but what in the hell was I going to do with all the steak I heard they give you? Um, no. I did manage to convince my husband to share some of his even though he insisted he was going to eat the entire thing. Mind you, this was before we saw the portions! So, the hubby ordered the chick fried steak, me the chick-n-dumplings, son ordered tke kids cheeseburger ($6.50) and 3 year old shared our food. We also had the fried okra app that was so good. Breaded just right, tender and with a horseradish-type sauce. YUM. When the food came out, I was laughing so hard at how large the chicken fried steak was. Needless to say, my husband was NOT eating that whole thing. He wasn't a huge fan of it, but I was. I thought it was flavored well and I really liked the batter (think a light beer batter). My chicken and dumplings were awesome. The chicken was plentiful and tender, within the white gravy, and biscuits soft. It came with a side of buttered corn, too, which were good. Oh yeah, my meal came with a choice of salad or slaw. I chose the slaw which was creamy, just the way I like it. The kids burger was good, and it was neat because it also comes with an individually packaged, small Blue Bell ice cream scoop. Th kids loved that. The service was great, too. The server was friendly in addition to the other staff. Would I come back for the chicken fried steak? Maybe not, but I definitely would for the chicken and dumplings. Maybe after I sweat enough calories at Bikram yoga!",

This place features some of the finest chicken fried steak I've had the pleasure of eating.  It was accompanied by genuine mashed potatoes, buttery corn, and a hearty biscuit.  The portions are as generous as the brim of a texan's hat.  This is also one of the few places you'll find Arizona where you can find Shiner Bock, the finest Texas beer.  If you hurry there now, you can probably still get the Shiner Bohemian Black Lager - a fine tasty beverage.  (They serve beers in a bottle accompanied by a curiously small frosted glass.  If you're not from the southwest, don't be alarmed.  I hear it's \"normal\" in the desert lands.)  All in all, the food was delicious and the owners have instilled a genuine appreciation of the customer that shines through in the service.  This place is about as fine of a casual dining spot as I've found in my travels!  Bring your appreciation for Conway Twitty and a hearty appetite.  Yee-haw!",

    "text": "I've been to Texaz grill a few times for their deadly, but pretty darn good chicken fried steak. This past Saturday, I went to grab a bite while my babies got groomed.   I sat down at the bar next to a group of bar flies that seemed to be regulars. The conversation was in full swing about politics, which they tried to drag me into but I politely declined and said \"I don't discuss politics while trying to digest food.\"  I ordered one of the specials which was a smoked hot link drenched in bbq sauce on a po-boy bun. It was served with coleslaw, but I ordered some Texaz fries with it. The hot link was dry and almost jerky-esque, possibly due to the smoking process, or maybe the links were just old. They were still tasty, and being a girl that is used to smoked meats around the house, I kind of enjoyed eating the semi-dry little discs. I tossed aside the top half of the po boy bun, and just ate the meat with the sauce soaked bottom half of the bun. The sauce was dark, with a smoky sweet flavor. The coleslaw was creamy and the cabbage was finely chopped. The Texaz potatos are chunks of seasoned, and fried potatos. I only ate about 3 or 4 before I was stuffed.   As is always the case with Texaz Grill, I wasn't overly delighted, but I wasn't overly disappointed. Texaz Grill is a dive that happens to serve pretty good food! It's nothing fancy, it's nothing sophisticated, but if you're in the mood for meat, or chicken fried steak, head there.",

It was definitely tacky but not without it's appeal.  Places like this tend to tout their \"Chicken Fried Steak\" Uber Alles  And If I remember correctly the menu claimed \"world famous, or something of that degree\" chicken fried steak  So what was I to do?  Well I ordered that there \"Chicken Fried Steak\" that's what.  I made the mistake of Ordering my salad with \"Mustard Vinaiarette\" the choices were that and \"Ranch\" I'm convinced they keep a cup of it around to \"prevent profiling\" I don't have anything against ranch, I don't hate america, I just prefer other dressings.  Our food came promptly, and the CFS was HUGE!!!!! (emphasis on HUGE) with a big mountain of mashed potatoes  The Meat was nice and tender and the breading was crispy but airy, I might have finished 40% of my meal at best. overall the food was actually quite good.  At one point the manager came by and checked on us,which is something I always like.  It's definitely the kind of place you'd expect to hear a record skip if you walk in the door impromperly attired, but it has a certain local flare and appeal that would bring me back in.",

For $15 is was a deal.  I added an extra salad for $2.  All dinners come with salad, choice of potatoes (fried or mashed -- the fried potatoes are chunks of potatoes, deep fried; the mashed are still a bit chunky with white gravy), and a roll and a biscuit.  The salad is basic -- iceberg lettuce and tomatoes.  Ranch or olive vinaigrette for dressing.  The olive is great!  Shiner bock is the house beer for $3.25 a bottle, other domestics are $2.75 each and imports are $3.75.  Our dinner, two salads, 2 Coors lights and one JD on the rocks was $29 including the tip.

I rarely eat red meat. I avoid fried foods whenever possible. That being said, I like to see my man happy - a knife in one hand, a fork in the other, and a big plate of Western goodness between the two.   TEXAZ seemed perfect. I read reviews, (not on Yelp, unfortunately), scoped out the location, and surprised him by taking him there a few months ago.   I, for one, loved the atmosphere. It was loud, a little rowdy, and filled to the ceiling with junk! An eclectic assortment of ephemera clung to the walls, accented with knick-knacks and taxidermied animals here and there. Imagine the inside of an Applebee's, except 10 times darker and decorated with items people actually accumulated over time, not stuff that came out of some corporate \"wacky interiors!\" starter kit.   The waitress was pleasant, but inattentive. The portions were huge, but bland. Even the biscuits were especially boring, and it's hard to make a buttermilk biscuit any more boring than it naturally is, just by existing. I tried to score some honey mustard to liven up my tasteless chicken entree, but no go - no sauces were available! What?! Even my boyfriend seemed less than thrilled by his big ol' meaty hunk of meat, served with a side of some bland starch or another. My boyfriend also found the beer selection to be lacking, but I can't vouch for the accuracy of this observation as I do not care about beer in the slightest.   For what it was, it was pricey. I felt like we could've gone to almost any other sit-down restaurant in a 2 mile radius and had a better experience for less cash.   We left full, but with nothing good to say other than \"my, that was a lot of food.\" Hardly ringing praise for a $50+ dinner bill. I don't think we'll be back...the lure of the 1970s concert posters and deer skulls isn't enough to justify a second visit.",

The menu is small: steaks, chicken, shrimp, etc. They are famous for their chicken fried steak. I'm not a fan personally but that's just due to my taste buds. I've recommended the dish to many people who loved it.   Recommendation when ordering the chicken fried steak at dinner, ask for the lunch portion. It's a little smaller and you are more likely to be able to finish it. The dinner portion could feed a family of 4!   The filet is my fav but the strip is just as fab. If you make it to dessert the bread pudding is phenomenal. Ask for it a-la-mode. It has a whiskey sauce drizzled over it and it comes out very hot so the ice cream evens the temp out a bit.   If you haven't been here yet, you need to check it out. There is so much stuff on the walls that you always have something to look at. Great place for families and they can accommodate large parties (maybe not 25, but 8-15 definitely!)",

Of course you can always get the lunch portion which is smaller, but then you don't have the extra goodies for later!    It's a small down home place, dress comfy and go there to eat up!  The wait staff is always the best and they know their stuff!    I've had their T-Bone here, and it's good, but really hard to go there and not get what made them famous!  Wonderful food!  Prices for lunch are around $7.00 and dinner around $12.00 - really hard to beat for real down home cooking!",

The rest of the place was a  dump..the bathroom had to be shared with employee changing his clothes...small is the word...I would bet you if Gordon Ramsey or the health dept inspected this dump the kitchen would be closed first thing....save your money and time, go back to Texas every now and then, go to the Market Diner on Harry Hines in Dallas and eat a REAL GOOD chicken fried  steak with fresh cream gravy and not that congealed goo from the texaz GRILL...I have had better from roadside vendors but nothing worse than the imitation chicken fried steak this place serves instead.....lazy @#$%'s",

I am also from Texas, the meat beneath the breading in the chicken fried steak was absolutely atrocious, the gravy was decent but not the best I have had. The bread was deplorable, I've had better day old bread from fry's. The bbq sauce tasted worse than krafts original, and this is supposed to be a homeage to Texas BBQ and food. I would never go there again even if I was starving and paid to eat there. For real bbq visit Bobby Qs on 27th ave and northern, I have yet to find a decent chicken fried steak in Phoenix.",

Now, I'm not a gravy person, so I ordered my chicken w/o gravy.  This was the most flavorless piece of fried chicken I've ever eaten.  The breading had ZERO seasoning in it, and the chicken was not seasoned.  While it was moist, it required generous amounts of tabasco to make it edible.  What a let down.  The buttermilk biscuit was good...and that was all I'd describe as above average.",

It is not fine dining, but it is straight out of a small town Texas Cafe complete with Shiner Bock and Blue Bell Ice cream.  The first time I walked in the door, I knew I was in an authentic Texas restaurant because they had a picture of Hondo Crouch on the wall.   Definitely a spot for Carnivores, any vegetarian will be very underfed (and perhaps alarmed at the conspicuous consumption of meat) It is Chicken Fried steak, mashed potatoes and gravy heaven.",

    "text": "My husband and I came to Texaz for our one year anniversary.  I was craving ribs and he's heard such great things about the CFS.  We didn't eat ALL day because we knew we were going to have a large dinner.  We entered Texaz and (we're not prissy by any means) just looked at each other.  There was a dead bird near the restrooms - my husband has a fear of birds.  I opened the menu and we literally had an option of three different choices of meats and CFS.  Since they didn't have ribs, I ordered the rib eye and my husband ordered the CFS.  I noticed right away that \"they don't season their meats.\"  WTH?  Whatev - there was salt and pepper on the table...and A-1.  Our food came with a salad (iceburg sopping with water) and you had a choice of ranch or some other vinegarette.  We both got ranch and it tasted like mayo with water.  The bread was one of those rolls that you get for Thanksgiving and a piece of French bread.  Nothing impressive that makes you want to binge.  Our food came really fast.  My steak was huge for $16 and so was his CFS.  I think there were two of them.  My steak was alright - even though I had to season it myself and dunk each piece in A-1 sauce.  I tried a bite of the CFS and wasn't impressed.  Mine is a lot better.  Let me mention that their margaritas are really good.  Not too strong but not too sweet.  The waitress was excellent.",

The place is crammed with dusty Texas stuff from the ceiling down the walls and on the counters. It's a bit over done for my taste.  The bar sits back from the door along one wall and is small and cramped all other seating appeared to be cramped booths. They offer daily supper specials, but on this evening it was the least appealing of them all. Wednesday Supper Special is Liver & Onions, I don't do Liver & Onions. Instead I had dessert! All desserts are $3.50 unheard of in restaurants anymore! I had the Homemade Hill Country Peach Cobbler, it comes warm so for an extra buck I went A La Mode and had a hefty scoop of Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. It's a real tasty cobbler and a good size one as well. Tammy the bartender was friendly and quick to serve as well as chat with ya. All the staff seemed pretty easy going and TEXAZ friendly. The menu has a tasty looking line up for both lunch and dinner. Lunch (mostly $7) is substantially less than dinner ($12 - $20) in prices. But one time or another I'll be back to try that awesome looking chicken fried steak or some fried fish or some BBQ spareribs. The place seems mighty fine for down home Texan cookin and it hasn't got a Good Ole Boys feel to it at all, as one person had told me it would.",

    "text": "Tex Az is a one of our favorite places to take/meet up with people in Central Phoenix...especially folks from out of town that are thinking that Arizona restaurants should be in a saloon-type atmoshere to be considered \"local\".    We take the newbies from out of town here pretty frequently.  It seems alot more \"genuine\" to most than going to a place like, say, Rawhide.    I grew up on a cattle farm...and KNOW good steak.  The steak we get at Tex Az is well aged and has great flavor.  The cut, in my expereince, is usually great, as well.  No disappointments there.  (try the NY Strip) Presentation is basic, but isn't that what you would expect? You are not paying Ruth's Chris' prices, right?  Best appetizer--Their chili!  it is VERY tasty and very hearty.  Best dessert--the bread pudding.  While the chicken fried steak used to be our favorite non-plain-steak entree--we have recently converted to the fried chicken.  It is very good.  With both \"chicken fried\" dishes,  the left-over reheating capability is pretty important since you get SO MUCH food...so the chicken wins out on this one..the Chicken reheats much better than the chicken fried steak.    The atmosphere is...well...it is UNIQUE...and isn't that what you want in your local saloon/steak house.  :0)  The service is equally as local/quirky.  We consider it ambiance and character. I don't think we have ever wanted for beverages in all of the times we have been there, as a note.    Parking can be a bit challenging on a busy night..but it all adds to the \"charm\".    We have likely been to Tex Az about 25 times over the years.  Not once were we disappointed...but we know what we are signing up for.    This isn't gourmet--a spear of asparagus would not dare show its face at Tex Az--but it is traditional type hearty Old West fare and the flavor is simple, yet great!!!",

The thing with Texaz grill is that I believe you can only go there and order 2 things off of their menu.  They are famous for the chicken fried chicken and the chicken fried steak, this is what you must order, and this is what everyone comes back for. If you are not a fan of these 2 items, then this place is not for you. Everything else on the menu is just average.  The portions are huge, you can easily split an order with someone, or take half of your meal home for left overs, which I think is a great value.  The decor is like a in the middle of nowhere Texas bar,  it's not fancy, and it's not meant to be.",

My favorite is Cx fried anything but have to go with Cx fried steak just to give the arteries a little bit of coating.  The steak was perfectly cooked and perfectly salted...2 points that distinguish good from great cx fried steaks.  The chili is classic and for some reason love it.  The atmosphere is southern hospitality, the location is perfect right off the 51....the parking is not great but park across the street for easier in and out.

There was enough sauce & coleslaw to go with, too, so I didn't have to ask for more! My husband's steak was pretty good, but a little bit dry and chewy. I don't know whether he got a tougher cut, or whether that's standard here.  Service: Our waitress was nice, and patient about answering all our questions. Everything came out in a timely manner, and we were happy with the way we were treated. Nothing stellar, but perfectly reasonable. Other staff seemed friendly, too.  Other points of interest: The decor was really interesting and made for a good conversation piece, and we liked how unique the restaurant was. It definitely has its own culture.

    "text": "My parents and I went to the Texaz Grill last night - I'm visiting from out of town and they wanted to take me out for a good dinner. We each ordered a drink, they each ordered a steak and I had the chicken fried steak (it should be noted that the chicken fried steak was pretty good!).  The problem was the disrespectful treatment we ended up receiving from the Manager.    When our food arrived, my Mom's steak was exactly as ordered, but my Dad's steak was the wrong order and was cooked well done (he probably would have graciously ate the wrong order if it weren't for the fact that it was well done... Who orders good steaks well done?)  So we waited about ten additional minutes for him to get the correct order brought to the table. The issue now was that my Mom and I now had two plates of cold food in front of us because we waited for his food to arrive before we started eating.  Fine.  We ate.  Our very nice waitress, Donna, asked if we wanted dessert, we declined (as we were pretty full - dinner was large) and just asked for our bill.  The real challenge came when the bill arrived and we asked (very politely) if they were willing to do something with the bill to make up for the mistake with my Dad's steak and my Mom and I having to eat cold food? Donna went to speak with the Manager and came back with the offer of a free dessert.  But we'd just declined dessert a few moments earlier, so that didn't seem like a good offer - we asked if maybe they could deduct the value of a dessert from our $75 bill? Donna said she'd have to send over her Manager.  A gentleman (the term is being used quite loosely) came over to the table and quite rudely told us \"mistakes happen\" - when my Mom tried to explain that we understood that, he rudely shut her down by saying \"you're not the one who had to wait\" (wrong! We all waited). When I asked him about deducting the value of one dessert from our bill, he actually accused me of trying to \"rob them\"!!  Crazy!  He eventually said he'd deduct the value of my drink from the bill (a $6 margarita) and stormed away from the table.  We were shocked at how rude he was being.  The re-issued bill arrived and, to our great surprise, the drink that was deducted was a $2 beer.  Needless to say, we won't be recommending the Texaz Grill to any of our friends and wanted our Yelp friends to know what happened there last night.  We understand mistakes happen, but we appreciate it when establishments make a bit of an effort to make it right.  REALLY didn't like being accused of trying to \"rob them\"!",

Definitely needs an update to remove clutter that should not be decor.(business cards, hats, etc)  if you can ignore that grungy look... the sevrice was great. Very friendly gal.   The food was huge portions..i couldnt finish and that doesnt happen often. No draft beers but a good bottle beer selection. Served with a tiny cold glass. We really enjoyed our meals and we will be back again soon to try something else",

Nothing says TX better than good 'ol Chicken Fried Steak and Mashed Potatoes with the skins on and this place has both!  Oh, they have steaks, hamburgers, BBQ, and chicken friend chicken too, but the Chicken Fried Steak is what they are famous for!  If you order the regular plate you will have MORE than you can eat at one sitting.  I usually order the Lil Tx Steak (or something like that) which is a smaller portion but still PLENTY!  The white cream gravy that is layered over the meat and the potatoes is just the right consistency.  All entree's come with the house salad which is pretty basic....iceburg lettuce with chopped green olives and dressing.  You also get a basket of biscuits and rolls with real butter!    There is a full bar including some unique beers.  Tonight I had a cocktail made with \"Moonshine\" alcohol distilled at a place right here in Tempe.  I can't remember the name of the cocktail but it was very satisfying!  There were five of us in our party and by the time we were finished eating we didn't have room to get a dessert each so we ordered one peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream and shared it (had we really been hungry this dessert would have only served two), but there was enough for each of us to get out sweet tooth satisfied and it was an excellent finish to a very satisfying meal.    The ambiance is WAY casual and the service is brisk....no sitting around chit chatting here.  Order, eat, pay and vamoosh!  LOL  Seriously, we had great service and truly enjoyed our evening.  We will be back again!",

Their food has been good with only a few times I was not pleased, but considering we have been there 100's of times, it is not a big deal. I think most of their meny is great, and have enjoyed just about everything on it, although their steaks could use a little more seasoning.  If you are prefer a \"pure\" steak- just a great cut of beef cooked with little to no seasoning, then this steak is for you. Don't mistake me- I am not saying anything negative about their steaks, just acknowledging that some people prefer a \"pure\" steak, and others like myself prefer a nicely seasoned steak- it's all personal preference, and neither way is wrong.",

Service is really great. Nancy was our server and she is a True pro. Very nice change of pace to have an attentive and efficient waitress. This place runs like clockwork.   Food was outstanding, and came out at just the right pace.  I love chicken fried steak, but I rarely order it because it never stacks up to the old Stroud's in Kansas City. Texaz does a very solid CFS. Giant, dinosaur sized piece of meat, cooked perfectly, just slightly under-seasoned, but overall awesome. I ate the entire thing, and I'm well under 200lbs. Coleslaw was near perfect, too.  My girlfriend had their ribeye. Cooked as ordered, very tasty. Her mashed potatoes were spot on. She was happy, and our dogs loved the connective tissue we brought home.   Beer list is a little thin, but that's not why you would come here. Decor is cool; definitely reminds me of a lot of the hole-in-the-wall places I've eaten at in mid-sized Midwest cities.   Pricing is good, but parking is shit. It's always busy for a reason, though. We came around 8p on a Tuesday, so luckily there was some parking and no waiting. If you come here during happy hour, best of luck!   Highly recommended.",

I've been driving by on Bethany Home since '85and I see that number changing all the time. Must mean this place is amazing. Loads of good ratings on Yelp. Must mean this place is amazing.   There were 2 of us. We both opted for the chicken fried steak. It's what they're known for. So, when you haven't been somewhere before you go with their claim to fame. Oops.  The fried steak was buried beneath too much breading for my taste. I found the steak to be tender but bland. The gravy had good flavor and it was easy to set aside some as it was plentiful.  The front-end staff was friendly. I think the waitress wasn't too happy with a 2-top on a busy night that didn't order alcohol, appetizers, sides, etc. She did her job. But, she didn't put much effort in - cost the total tab a dessert thus cost the tip a bit as a direct result. I really want dessert after dinner but I don't order unless the server asks or offers - that should be automatic and requires zero effort for the potential for a bigger tip.   Perhaps this place is better targeted toward people who have more of a taste for Texas inspired food than I.",

Eclectic decor? Check. Bumper stickers, license plates, University of Texas football team picture from 1986. This place has it all.  Portions large enough to feed Zeus, Mr. T, and a Brontosaurus at the same time? Check. The ribs were probably taken straight from an elephant. The biscuits are about as large as my newborn's head. And the chicken fried steak is enough food for the offensive line of the Dallas Cowboys.  This place is the real deal. A few reviewers have been disappointed by the heaviness of the food. To that small minority, I would say this- you came to the wrong restaurant. It's called TEXAZ Grill. I'm not sure if they know what kale is.",

TEXAZ is an unassuming place on the outside and settled in a very tight corner of the shopping center. Like I said very unassuming. Once you walk in then BOOM. It's like a time warp taking you back to Texas in the 1970's. Place is decorated with old pictures related to Texas, road signs, animal heads, caps, and old license places. Very interesting and very loud. Everyone talking, eating, and having a good time.   We started out with our usual fries okra. This is the only place I can find fried okra in AZ. Nice change of pace. Love the okra. Nice and crisp. Love it. So I ordered their famous Chicken Fried Steak. They say it's the best in AZ and I can't disagree. All meals comes with a side salad. Salad doesn't look that appetizing but it's not bad. House dressing is pretty good. Anyways, the CFS comes with two huge pieces hanging off the plate smothered with gravy and comes with mash potatoes. Very crispy and fresh. Not greasy at all. Really good. Best in AZ hands down. Only problem is that it's too much food. I couldn't even come close to to finishing it. I saw two guys at a table across from us share an order of CFS. Very smart and would probably recommend sharing this huge meal. My wife ordered the Fried Catfish. Two large pieces of fish with a side of mash potatoes. Wife loved it. Not greasy at all. Fresh and moist but again a lot of food. So good. Everyone's ordering the CFS and fried catfish. There's a reason.   My son ordered the prime rib regular cut. Really big piece of meat with a side of mash potatoes. My son really liked the prime rib. He's a fussy eater and he really like the prime rib. So when he likes it then I know it's really good. Looked juicy and fresh.   We were stuffed with all this food. Packed up our leftovers but you can't leave this place without dessert. We shared the pecan pie. Oh my gosh. Your probably laughing right now but this is the best pecan pie. Had pecan pie from Texas and all over and this is the best I've had. It had a hard topping that most pecan pies don't have. A little chewy and not as sweet as most pecan pie. Crust is outstanding. Hands down yummy.   So the food was really really good. The service was also outstanding. Once we sat down our server was there for our drink orders. Food was brought to our table really fast and they cleaned off our dirty dishes very quickly. We also had our server and owner check on us to make sure everything is okay. Everyone makes you feel at home just like in Texas.   So good food (aka little too much), good service, and good dessert. Enjoy and bring a wheel barrow to roll you out. It's that good.",

By the time you add drinks and other al a carte items to your meal, Texaz definitely isn't cheap, but for what you get you could do a lot worse at many places around Phoenix.  For sure this place is far better than any of the chain steakhouses like Longhorn, Outback or Black Angus, which should always be avoided when other options are available.Texaz is a neighborhood institution, which means it's worn and dirty, but I'm sure many people consider that to be part of this restaurant's charm. One caveat, especially for women with purses: the barriers between the booths in the front section don't go all the way down to the cushions, so it's possible and easy for adjacent diners to reach into your booth and take items out of your purse or coat without you noticing.",

The serving staff is friendly, and stable (meaning that they've been there for years...). They all know me by name and are wonderful. Steve the owner always hangs out meeting his guests too. If looking for a very reasonably priced American (Texas/southern) Cafe, then this is the place. You will be delighted. Its been open over 25-years, same owner, and the quality is consistently superior. Its the treat I've given myself every week for over 15-years.",

    "text": "We went there last night and I'm thinking other reviews must be from their regulars. It was nothing like other reviews described. Our waitress seemed to have an instant dislike to us. When I asked for the honey mustard dressing she said \"There's no honey in it, it's our house vinaigrette.\" I ordered it and it was totally wilted. I like to always let my husband sample my food and when she saw me give it to him she said \"You don't like it!\". My steak was bland and had to be sent back because it was underdone. Our friend is a vegetarian and asked if they could make her a grilled cheese sandwich, which they declined. She's 17 and then asked for a kid's menu to see if there were kid friendly dishes and was told it was for 12 and under and wasn't even allowed to see what other choices there were. The icing on the cake was to hear the waitress mock vegetarians to her regular customers by us. She said you don't want cheese on your salad then I will hold that. Btw, she's a vegetarian not vegan. We kept saying she just doesn't eat meat, but eats dairy. Then she asked if she wanted her to hold the olives and tomatoes. Maybe she didn't know what a vegetarian is. I asked if we could order her a cheeseburger and just hold the patty and she said \"Why would you want to do that?\".",

Ordering take out has always been main dish and mashed potatoes and 'GRAVY IN A CUP TO GO'! No more! If not specified 'ON THE SIDE' it is now poured over the meal and there ya go! When a 'to go' order is served 6-8 hours later, it is mush! But most disturbing was the attitude I got from the waitress and the new owner. Wow, unbelievable! After 20 years of dining, ordering has been changed and then I am told 'we have always done it this way'! I can only attribute it to new management and economical problems because I have never encountered such an attitude of 'we don't need your business'.  I love their food, but not enough to return and be treated in such a manner.",

    "text": "So my wife and I were able to have someone watch the kids and I had movie tickets. so a nice dinner was in order. We were actually driving to the east side of town possibly going to 5n-diner or Islands Restaurant. .love it. BUT we were pleasantly diverted.   Being such a nice night we had the windows rolled down and were driving by 16th street and Bethany home road. It was like you see in the cartoons when the smell lures Foghorn Leghorn to a freshly baked pie at grannys window. . The aroma had me and I found my self quickly changing plans and following the smell. . I found my self to TexAZ Grill.   This is a really fun place to go and is very easy going laid back. Again this is one of those places where you can spend hours looking at all the crap on the walls.  .and yes. we found our selves doing just that.   I looked at the price first when I opened the menu and said do my self. Just about everything is over $12.   Let me tell you, you get two or three times what you pay for. My wife ordered her all time most popular dish\"chicken frid steak: and I got the chop steak. I uploaded a photo of my wifes dish with her hand over the food just to show you the portion we got. We could have both eaten off her place and been stuffed. The potatoes were to die for.   I can not think of anything that was bad about the evening. Even the NA beer I had \"O'dules amber\" quite good actually. Once I can afford to go back I am and I'm bringing friends next time.",

I can make liver and onions just fine at home but then the apartment smells like liver for a week.  Got there about 6:30 and the place was packed.  I had a choice of waiting at the bar or just eating there anyway.  I chose to eat there and I had a good view of the basketball game on the TV so all was good.  For $9.00 I got 3 good sized slices of liver, a bunch of bacon, a mound of onions, mashed potatoes and gravy and a small salad.  For what I paid the food was quite good and plentiful.  The service was excellent.  I still don't care for skins in my potatoes but the option was wedge fries with skins on.  At some point I will come back to try the chicken fried steak.  After several decades of street widening on Bethany Home and 16th st the parking lot is not big vehicle friendly.  The bartender said after the bank closes to the North most folks with trucks park there, including her.",

I always think about, maybe switching things up, ordering something else. But no, I can't it's just too amazing. Ok so I've mistakenly ordered the fried steak, which turned out to be a happy accident. It too, tasted great. I've also tried, bites of other dishes, and pretty much everything tastes great. Portions are really generous. I usually end up boxing up about half of my meal. The salad and bread, do me in almost every time. Texaz has a \"Clean Plate Club Card\" sadly, I only have few stamps, I doubt I'll ever fill it. Even if I did, I wouldn't be able to enjoy the desert that's rewarded when your card is fully stamped.   My Family has enjoyed eating at Texaz for many years now. Texaz is always amazing, every single time!",

    "text": "Nope, nope, nope.  I came here on the recommendation of other fellow Yelpers and I am so disappointed.  Firstly, parking is a mess.  Next, I came with my husband and two year old daughter and the hostess told me that they don't have a high chair that can accommodate a two year old so she had to use a booster seat.  The problem is that she's at that middle age where she's almost done with high chairs and still too immature for a booster seat.  What a mess trying to keep her in her booster seat and contained.  She wasn't noisy or badly behaved, per se, she just wanted to stand up in the booth and look around and fidget with all the condiment bottles on the table.  Also, can I mention that the booths have a weird half wall that obscures the other diners from the chest up, but is open from the chest level down, so someone in the other booth could easily reach underneath the wall and dig around in your purse if they wanted to, or your two year old can peek underneath the booth wall to play peek-a-boo with the diners on the other side?  It's pretty weird.  So the waitress came over took our drink orders with a minimum of small talk (or overall friendliness).  We perused the menus.  My husband chose a beef brisket sandwich.  I wanted a t-bone steak, I had been craving one and I was looking forward to it.  We ordered our dinners and it's worth mentioning that at NO point did the waitress acknowledge that presence of our daughter.  She never asked us what she wanted to eat or if she needed anything to drink either, apparently she was invisible.  Seeing as how there weren't any kids meals on the menu, I just assumed we'd feed her from our own plates, but interestingly the waitress just assumed that too because she didn't even ask if she'd be having a side order of something as her meal,  She just looked right past her.  If I sound pissed it's because I was.  I don't need the waitress to pinch her cheeks and make baby talk with her, but to merely acknowledge the fact that there were three human beings sitting at the booth that night would have been covered in 'Basic Manners 101'.  So my steak was very flavorful and tender but BADLY undercooked, terribly fatty and a sickly color gray.  (It didn't have a nice sear or a good caramel color to it.)  I ordered it medium rare, but instead I got bloody, almost blue meat.  And there was so much fat that I only got about half meat, the rest was all scrap fat and the bone.  My sides were non-descript.  I think my mashed potatoes were probably decent, I honestly can't even remember that's how non-descript they were.  The roll and bread 'basket' that came with my food (one little roll and one little cold biscuit) were hard and tasted store bought.  And my hungry toddler didn't even want them.  My husband's beef brisket sandwich was a pathetic, dried out, flavorless waste of good money.  We didn't even bother with desserts.  I had a margarita; it was very good, but beguilingly strong for how petite the rock glass is that it was served in.  After I finished it the waitress came around and asked me if I wanted another and I declined, but my husband (a non-drinker) immediately piped up and said \"Yes, she'll have another!\" and shot me a playful look, and rather than looking to me so see if I *really* wanted another $7 margarita or not she simply walked away and had the bartender make me another one!  WTF?  So within a couple of minutes I had yet another very, very strong margarita sitting in front of me.  Now I'm no cheapskate but I don't like to waste money so I choked down that second margarita and it was the proverbial 'straw that broke the camel's back'.  I may have finished it, but it definitely finished ME.  I spent the rest of the night stumbling and mumbling to myself about someone slipping me a mickey.  I've never, ever had a margarita that strong and I am a very well seasoned drinker.   What of Earth did they put in them??  So to sum it up I spent over $60 (includes the tip) for 2 small Molotov cocktails disguised as margaritas, an undercooked, fatty, t-bone steak, an inedible, dry beef brisket sandwich and a big serving of NOTHING for my child.    Never again.  The two stars are for the flavor and tenderness of the otherwise failure of a steak and the extreme value for your money on the alcohol.  THAT'S IT.",

I need MEAT!\" was all he said when I asked him what he wanted. Fine, i'll find meat...So enters this restaurant. Really cute, dive-ish restaurant with an awfully small parking lot and equally small interior space. It's the type of joint that you would find in a cute, cozy small town where regulars flock to.   We were seated immediately and was greeted by our sweet and friendly waitress. She was attentive and quick, even though she was servicing quite a few other tables.   The food was good; very comforting and filling but nothing special. Mr and I shared the Rib Eye and the in-laws got the NY steak, each. We added their cup of chili, side of mashed potatoes with house gravy, salad, and potato wedges. They also have whole jalepenos for $.10, which we got 5 of. All in all, it was a good meal but definitely not a Mastro's or Fleming's. If you want a nice, normal dinner with no frou-frou, this is the place!",

    "text": "This is my go to place for Chicken Fried Steak.  If you're a fan of it, you'll never go anywhere else after you've tried theirs.  IF there is a complaint, there's always too much of it.  LOL  Like that could be a complaint.  Lunch tomorrow!!  Room mate had some fried fish dish (probably cod.  I was too busy with my steak.)  He was raving about that too.  And from what I've heard (I don't like but one of my friends is a connoisseur of it) their liver and onions is out of this world too.  There is a wait time usually if you go during peak hours and peak days but well worth it.  The wait staff is very friendly and personable....and always busy.  They'll always stop by to make sure that you're happy and check if you need a refill.  That's always very much appreciated.   As far as the restaurant goes:  5 of 5.  Now comes the \"lost star\".  Location, location, location.  No parking.  It's in a strip mall with very little parking and there's also a bar in this strip mall and a bunch of other stores.  Anyhow, I'm usually frustrated by the time I get to the front door because it's a struggle to park.  Other than that, you need to go here!!  Great food, great staff!!!!",

Lone Star Steaks moved in and for several years it was a terrific steak house run by Texans.  They served up a great chicken fried steak and other Texas favorites and developed a good local following.  Then the corporations came in and made them cease and desist using the name Lone Star (beer and steak corps) which really was a shame.  They came back with the name TexAZ Grill.  The menu stayed the same as did the local following of patrons.  They have great pork chops, steaks and the BEST chicken fried steak in the city!  The whiskey bread pudding is one of the Hubby's favorites and I do indeed enjoy the pecan pie a la mode so sweet your teeth ache.  Staff is outstanding!",

    "text": "Wow!  Please read the entire review. I'm concerned about what's going on at TexAz.  My wife and I have been eating at this restaurant for many years. We no longer live in Phoenix and always make a point to stop and get our fix of great food when we come to town.   I hope the meal they served us was just a fluke, but if not, Houston we have a problem........!!! We notice immediately once our meals arrived that the Chicken Fried Chicken and the Chicken Fried Pork Chop were definitely thinner.  The Pork Chop had no salt and the breading was oily and fell off the both meat entrees.  The biscuits were not the same fluff and size and the Okra didn't make the cut, not fresh, seeds were too larger due to older in the field. It seemed FROZEN.   The reason why the breading falls off are as follows: 1. Brined too long 2. Meat is not dried prior to coating with seasoned flower  3. Oil temp not hot enough when dropped in the fryer My wife is from the south and we know something about frying, that's why this place was so awesome.  They never cut corners! Service was excellent!   We will give it one more try, but if the new owner continues to tinker with a once outstanding products we fear TexAz will go the way of Dodo Bird sad to say.  Why someone would buy a business that works and think changes won't be noticed.  Trust the people who got you to the promised land.  Your reputation is on the line!",

    "text": "A group of 5 of us arrived for dinner at 6:00. The rude hostess refused to sit us at one of the vacant larger tables and instead crowded us into a 4 top. Needless to say, this was not a good start to the meal.   We were offered a choice of salad or cole slaw to start with. Unfortunately, 3 of us opted for the cole slaw, which while nice and creamy was loaded with onion and perhaps some garlic. None of us could finish the cole slaw because the onion was so strong. We tried the biscuits, which were undercooked and pastey. One bite was all that anyone could tolerate.  Next we ordered main courses. Two people ordered the Saturday Special steak Lin Sue. A  N.Y. strip steak topped with artichoke hearts, jumbo shrimp and then covered in bearnaise sauce. I don't know who thought this combination up, but neither of the people who ordered it finished it. One of the comments was that the shrimp were well overcooked.  Companion ordered the \"famous\" chicken fried steak because there was no prime rib available. It came smothered in a very thick, heavy gravy that could only be compared to wallpaper paste. They may have served hundreds of thousands of chicken fried steaks, but if they were like this plate I feel sorry for all those who tried to eat it.   I ordered the pork chops with gravy and mashed potatoes. I was lucky in that the pork chops were nicely cooked - however they were covered in the same \"gravy glop\" that everything else was hidden under.   Most of our party asked for take home boxes with the idea of feeding the leftovers either to 2 legged or 4 legged members of their household.  Next we ordered dessert. Once again, I picked the winner - peach cobbler topped with vanilla ice cream. Served warm, it was flavorful though the crust was not well cooked. The ice cream was nice.  Another of our party ordered the bread pudding with whisky sauce. The bread pudding was very dense and did not look like any other bread pudding I have ever seen. As we passed it around the table, one of our party got a bite that had raw whisky in it and couldn't stop coughing.   Another item which was passed around was the \"Old New Orleans Calas\" which were supposed to be sweet rice balls, deep fried and dusted with sugar. Whoever made them forgot to put the sugar on them and totally overcooked them to the point that the rice was crunchy and inedible. They were not deemed to be something that anyone would take home.  On the positive side, our waitress was excellent and a total hoot. She was lots of fun and our tips reflected her good nature.  The restaurant is decorated with all sorts of kitsch, which prevented us from ascertaining the cleanliness or lack thereof of the restaurant.  Our party has requested of me that we not return there again. 2 stars",

I took our youngest, for lunch, and he was mesmerized by all the memorabilia, on the wall and ceiling. It was entertaining, to see the look, on his face. I love it, when I get to surprise, our kids. Even though the youngest, just turned 30. Can't remember what he had, but he devoured, every last bite. I got the country fried steak, and it was enough, for 3 meals.  This is another place, that has never been a disappointment. If you go, just make sure you go after the rush hour, or you'll have to wait in line. Not that it isn't worth the wait! I just lothe, lines. Go, go, go, and try this place out. Not only, is the food great, I never go, where I don't meet someone, interesting.

    "text": "My first visit, for lunch several months ago, was so positive I couldn't wait to return. From the moment I walked in, and caught a whiff of bbq smoke,and felt the Texas vibe, I was sure I would love this place. My only True Texas steak house experience had been at Big Vern's in Shamrock (delicious) and The Big Texan Steak Ranch in Amarillo (more hype than flavor), so I was anxious to try this AZ outpost. My lunch of the beef ribs was so tasty and tender, I counted the days until I could return to satisfy my carnivorous urges. I managed a return last Friday for an early dinner, and had such a horrible experience that even those wonderful beef ribs might not be enough to lure me back. Our party of three was quickly seated, and then ignored, despite the moderate crowd. Two of us had the misfortune of ordering the Salisbury steak, and my wife had the liver and onions. Although my companion had ordered his steak cooked medium, and I, medium well, both arrived extremely undercooked. We sent them back, and had them returned to us, assured by our waitress that they were new steaks. Suffice it to say that they both tasted like canned dog food smothered in a hideous version of 'mushroom gravy'. They were so bad that we considered returning them again, but as they were 'early dinner specials', didn't. We really should have. My wife's liver proved just as bad. We left thinking that they must intentionally make the specials inedible to dissuade folks from ever again straying from the higher priced regular menu. The problem is, our dinners were so bad, we'll probably not return to test our theory. It's a damn shame, cuz those ribs were so good.",

Place was nice however the crew were not very friendly or welcoming as you would expect from a place that use Texas in their name which was very disappointing since we have been stationed and lived in Texas before. Anyway, our hostess/waitress, Cynthia came and took our orders. Place was not busy but seems like it took awhile to get our food. I ordered chix fried goodness and my husband ordered beef kabob. Mine was not so bad but my husband's kabab was 3 square of meat and veggies. For $20.00 a plate, it was kind of expensive. You could have spent the same amount at Black Angus and get great service and good food. Anyway, we asked for our ticket since we were in a hurry to go to an appointment and Cynthia brought it. My husband, a 20 yrs Career Retired Navy Veteran is proud to have served for his country and whenever we go places and we are asked to pay with credit/debit card or asked for id, we automatically pull out our military ids as it is an important part of our life that we have been accustom to. Cynthia came back and she thought at first that we were doing spit pay so she ask and my husband said no that is just my credit card and id. We were in shocked when Cynthia said, WE DO NOT DO MILITARY. WOW, WOW. She walked away and we were in shocked starring at each other in disbelieve of what she has just said. To be in a restaurant that is named after the Great State of Texas and to have a hostess/waitress who was probably at least 55 yrs of age or older waited on you and to hear that, we thought to ourselves, that you can go to Chick-Fil-A  and get an excellent customer service, better food and pay a lot less. We are not the ones who always provide feedback on restaurants or other places but OMGoodness, to be in America and have an American tell you, \"WE DO NO DO MILITARY\" was shocking. I think as old as she was, maybe there were better words to be used.",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to give this place a try one afternoon after seeing this place for years. One of the major issues we have with places that serve chicken fried steak is that the gravy is usually not very flavorful nor is the steak itself. I'm very pleased to say this place surprised us both.   It is very obvious that this place puts a lot of hard work and passion into their food. The batter covering the steak was delicious and the meat inside was seasoned up proper and tender. And that gravy covering it? I am licking my lips thinking about it as it had just the right amount of pepper and not overbearing in salt at all! The waitress was super friendly, even gave us a sample of their Texas style chili so we could see what the difference was.   And the mashed potatoes....were just like the ones my mother would serve on Thanksgiving day; skin on, so you know they're real and lumpy with a delicious butter and pepper taste to them. I'm willing to wager they probably use milk in them just to make them extra fluffy.   I got the chicken fried steak and my wife got their barbeque sampler. Ribs were a smidge salty but I'm still giving these guys a five star review because it felt so nice eating at a no frills, down home place. I'll make sure next time we go in to save room for their dessert as I do love bread pudding.",

Perfect rosy center, almost fork-tender, and the flavor--the best prime rib we ever had. Would like to sample other menu items when we return, but it'll be hard to resist the pr. We would like to have seen a cooked veggie on the plate. The mashed taters were great; the salad was OK. Our waitress was super nice and helpful. When my husband asked the best way to heat up his copious leftover meat, she suggested warming it is some of the au jus--then went to the kitchen and brought back  a little container of it. What a doll! I agree with others that you almost have to helicopter into the the parking lot. Next time we might look elsewhere and walk a little. Notwithstanding, I won't budge on my five stars for the food.",

First time I had the smoked prime rib, better than most expensive steakhouses. Second time was a Monday (check there Website for each days special) and fried chicken was half a bird...extra crispy goodness. Today the special was bbq beef back ribs. Five Flintstone sized ribs on the plate. Waitresses are all super helpful and know how to serve. My only downside is the potato choices. Not a big potato fan the Texas fries are big chunks and the mashed are really dense. Good country gravy though. Might try potato salad next time. Have my eyes on the big bubby enchilada next.",

    "text": "\"Incredible\"  \"Magnificent\"  \"The best chicken fried steak on this side of the world\"  -Me, after my first, second, and third bite at this heavenly restaurant.   First, you walk in and there is not an inch of paint you can see on the walls -- they are completely covered with miscellaneous items such as license plates and deer heads. Awesome, simply the perfect atmosphere to get in the mood to eat fried food.   We were greeted by two very friendly people who sat us quickly. They were extremely attentive and quick to get our orders in. Obviously, I ordered the chicken fried steak, and obviously, you will also order the chicken fried steak.   We were served coleslaw and a biscuit while we waited in anticipation for what was to come. I took small bites of both, trying to save room for my feast, but couldn't help but gobble down the biscuit which was a flakey and buttery. I'm not a fan of coleslaw, so I can't really comment on that, but it looked very creamy, if that's how coleslaw is supposed to look.   The chicken fried steak. wow. First, you get not one, but TWO giant pieces of meat covered in gravy with a side of potatoes (I chose mashed). It was absolutely fantastic. Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and the gravy was topped perfectly. The mashed potatoes were great, but I pushed them aside so I could shove my face in the steak.  They packaged our chicken fried steak for us to go with an extra side of gravy at no charge (bless them), as there was no way we were going to finish it all.   One of the wonderful people who worked there (who I believe was the manager) overheard it was my birthday and did not let me leave without giving me a scoop of ice cream and announcing to the restaurant it was my birthday. Seriously, they are too friendly.  TLDR: eat here if you want to experience what heaven is like.",

    "text": "So I'm a az transplant here in 1996 from Texas and I love it here but I'm still a Texan at heart... born and raised Houston Texas.   I had a hankering for a real chicken fried steak and lo and behold here I am. I am impressed by a menu that's not too large with multiple items. The menu is smaller but it has all the staples you're want.   I got the CFS and it was huge and tasteful. I had the coleslaw which wasn't too wet and I had the steak fries otstead of mashed...wow o didn't want to leave. Good food!   Parking through leaves a lot to be desired... you have to do a three point turn about 6 times to fit it in a spot... small lot and small spots. You can try to come in off 7th street but that parking is directional so you need to be driving west. I parked off the Bethany home entrance.  However the place ambiance is definitely pretty intense on the decor. :-)  Ok so it's now 2018 and OMG the place is awesome still... always something new and amazing on the menu especially the daily features. I wish I didn't move so far away... however I still make it a time to visit and eat and enjoy... I think it's an amazing place to eat and relax without anyone pushing you out the door to get table and they do have both tables and booth and a bar to sit at and yes the have a nice hidden parking area lol anyway I upgrade to 5 stars",

The dinner portion is two generous pieces of lightly battered, crispy on the outside, moist and tender on the inside catfish served with delicious tartar sauce on the side, while the lunch or optional smaller portion is one piece of fish.  A dinner salad, biscuits, and Someone on Yelp complained about the simple, chopped lettuce salad which they felt was served with too much dressing.  That is easily remedied by simply asking for dressing on the side, which my husband always does because he only likes a little and prefers to put it on to his liking ... simple!  The mashed potatoes with country gravy are rustic ON PURPOSE, hello!  If that's not your thing, there are other choices you can substitute, just ask!  Sometimes I'm more conscious of watching carbs and choose sliced tomatoes instead, and you can, too, just ask your waitress for suggestions!  All in all, this is a fun place to enjoy traditional comfort food, the hustle and bustle, the busy but friendly staff, the funky Western decor, and the wide variety of folks who enjoy the same.  If you want \"fine dining,\" get out the big bucks and go somewhere else, but if you want simple, down-home food in a unique environment, try TEXAZ!",

    "text": "It pains me to write this. I am a Texan, a Houstonian. I was raised on chicken fried steak and moved to Phoenix two decades ago with cream gravy in my veins. I know full well what a good cat fish dinner taste like and no one can tell me that Blue Bell is \"ok\". I first found Texaz Grill when it was Texas Grill - before they were forced to change the name. That said, I have been eating here for a very long time and they are - had been - the next best thing to the real thing when it comes to chicken fried steak. That hot plate of the golden mother-load was satisfying and warming to a home-sick soul. I think I may have cried the day I came in, sat at a booth and saw the placard on the table that simply read, \"We now carry Blue Bell Ice Cream\". That's been some time now.   I moved away a few years ago but for whatever reason I have to return to Phoenix, Texaz Grill is a no-brainer. About a year ago I ordered the usual CFS and we were a little surprised to find the meat was tough. Before, all you needed was a fork and maybe a knife for good manners. We wrote it off as a fluke but then the next time, a few short months later, another order in town and it was ... weird ... chewy. What happened to the melt-in-your-mouth CFS this place has been warmly bringing out for ages? I began to wonder if there has been a change of suppliers for their meat, a new cook overdid it - denial and love for some Texas home cooking kept me silent and I went back again. The catfish had always been a winner, my S.O. ordered that and it turned out to be the better meal. Wow. I was so sad.   A few months passed, enough for us to forget, so here we were this week after anxiously watching family and friends go through Hurricane Harvey, I wanted nothing more than a Texaz Grill CFS & gravy to hug my soul.   ...sigh... I cannot recall having to fight so hard to get a piece of meat to tear away so I can swallow it without fear of choking on the tendon strings.  Me with a knife: cut, cut, cut, cut, CCUT, CUTT,,, CUT. Then literally grabbing one end with my teeth, the other ripping it with my hand to get it to split so it is safe to chew. And chew, and chew, and chew, and chew... . We didn't finish it. This is *NOT* a ~Texas~ chicken fried steak. It was like Denny's wishing it was. But the catfish, as always, was good.   I am so, so, disappointed. This is the forth time, so this is no longer a fluke. I do not know what has happened over there but Texaz Grill, you need to know that whoever is supplying your meat these days, I would take it under serious consideration to look into them a little deeper. Maybe it's the prep that has changed - I don't know but something changed with the CFS and not for the good. Again, I am from Texas and we know meat. This stuff is bad. Really bad. After nearly choking on tendon-like strings (on two different occasions) that wouldn't tear, also the very thought of so many tendon-like strings in my mouth really grosses me out, I'm wondering what exactly is this 'meat' that I'm eating???  Honestly, I'm sorry, but after several overlooks and tries I have to resign myself to the truth: I am an old-school customer and a Texan so I know what this place used to cook when it came to chicken fried steak and I know how it *should* be cooked. But the truth is, it's terrible and I no longer feel safe eating it. Anyone who is new to this place and not well versed in a properly cooked, tender Texas Chicken Fried steak will be in 'awe' of the plateful and love it and maybe those are your new customers who don't know any better. But for folks like me who miss our mama's home cooking and greasy hole-in-the-wall local restaurants serving it up as it's meant to be and sometimes just need a \"I hate you Hurricane Harvey\" hug, I'll have to wait until i get back home again cuz i give up.   Good luck.",

We saw the great reviews and were in the mood for some meat, so this was the choice. Parking is pretty difficult so I'd suggest parking in the big plaza across the street and just walking.  Upon entering, the place is littered with cool memorabilia everywhere. This seems like the spot to go to cause it was packed that night. We were seated pretty fast and ordered the chicken fried steak, fried okra and a NY strip topped w/artichoke and jumbo shrimp.  First off, the portions here are HUGE. You start off with a choice of coleslaw or salad, then came the good stuff. The steak was delicious and the jumbo shrimps topped with some magical sauce were amazing. I'm a pretty big fan of country fried steak, but I was expecting a bit more. Yes, it was about 3/4ths of the plate and had another one underneath, but without it being smothered in gravy, I actually felt like it was pretty bland to eat on its own.  Worth a visit!",

He ordered the chicken fried steak, I ordered the half portion, and my husband ordered the bbq sampler being featured that night. The portions were huge, I mean HUGE. The half portion was enough for two people to easily share and all entrees were served with either a house salad or cole slaw and a basket of biscuits and rolls to share. The chicken fried steak is served with mashed potatoes and gravy, all a bit under seasoned for me but still enjoyable. My husband's sampler had brisket, ribs, and a sausage. He didn't really care for the brisket or ribs but enjoyed the sausage. The crowd here is on the older side, the decor is a bit over the top, the restaurant itself seems a bit aged but you can tell that there are a lot of regulars that really enjoy coming here. Worth a shot if you are in the mood for some comfort food, and a lot of it!",

We ordered the smoked prime rib meal, which included biscuit and roll, salad, mashed potatoes/gravy and prime rib. The prime rib was done perfectly, and had a great smoky flavor. Big big portions too. My only complaint would be that my prime rib was just a tad cool (temperature) - should have been a little warmer. But at least it wasn't overcooked!  Great atmosphere, and fun place.",

The chicken fried steak was huge, but that was the only think good about it. It lacked flavor and seasoning. The gravy was strange, a cross between white and brown gravy. The mashed potatoes were ok but covered with the gravy. The prime rib was ok but the smoke taste was overwhelming. The parking was a sign but we decided to try it. A restaurant without windows is quite depressing even with the eclectic decor.  The people and service was good. This place was not for us.",

    "text": "After completing a major work project this week, I was in the mood for some steak and decided to give this place a try.  Located at the corner of E Bethany Home Road & N 16th St. The first noticeable issue with the location is the lack of parking (-1).  The parking lot is extremely small and shared with other popular businesses.  Thankfully I got there a bit late and someone was pulling out. Even maneuvering within the parking lot is extremely difficult.  The signage for the restaurant could do with a sprucing up but was still somewhat noticeable from across the street.  Staff were friendly but weren't overly friendly (-0.5).  They were attentive to our needs, like checking up on our meals, and even taking our orders in a timely fashion.  The place is small inside but it has age and character.  Lots of memorabilia on the walls and ceilings.  Some booths aren't completely cordoned off so you can see fellow patrons beneath the partitions.  Drinks were served timely but food took some time to come.  Menus were simple, short, and not too in depth.  Food tasted good - their ribeye was cooked to perfection and was soft, juicy, tender, and not overly seasoned; and the dish comes with fries or mashed potatoes with gravy, bread, a biscuit, coleslaw or salad.  The coleslaw was served on its own and fresh and too runny.  The bread and biscuit was warm.  The mashed potatoes were perfect - not dripping off your fork kinda mashed but semisolid enough, and the gravy complemented it really well.  I'd love to come back and try their country fried steak which, I heard is good, but I'm reluctant to based on the abysmal parking situation.",

Those wedges were crispy and above average, but the brisket was just average in the chopped form. Not sure why Texas places cannot replicate Southern chopped brisket, but it is never as good as down south or southern style places. It wasn't horrible, but the BBQ sauce was watery and did not add much and the bottom bun was soaked through, so no way was this going to be eaten sandwich style. The place was decorated with animal heads and other crazyiness and the parking lot is a very tight squeeze if your there at the wrong time. The waitress was very nice though and it's worth another visit to try something else.",

The greens for the salad looked they came out of a bag and definitely were not fresh.  Kind of that slimy one week old feeling ... We both had the house dressing.  Didn't like it.  My wife had the chicken, I had the Lin Su (a steak with two shrimp on top, and our son had the BBQ.  My son liked the BBQ.  My wife and I didn't care for ours.  Perhaps we were so turned off by the salad that it colored our perception of the meal.  I'm not sure.  We might try it again.  Hopefully the salad is an anomaly.",

If you pull into the spots right in front of the building, they're for compact cars, and there's no valet. There is a lot behind the building with ample sized spots, so look for the turn in off Bethany Home.  The decor is a little tacky and over the top, but I guess that adds to the restaurant's charm. The staff is friendly and helpful.  Chicken fried steak - awesome. The portion is huge, and it's cooked just like it should be. Accompanying mashed potatoes are quite good. I was surprised that the brisket sandwich was so good. The meat is really tender, flavorful, and thick cut. I like that they top it with BBQ sauce and then provide extra on the side. Portion was also big, although the chicken fried steak is hard to beat in terms of quality, quantity, and price. My husband and I could have split it and still had leftovers.  We had plenty of leftovers and couldn't try any dessert (unfortunately) because we were so full. I really want to go back and try the other menu items, like the chili, one of their many steaks, and the chicken fried chicken. If you like Texas staples, give TEXAZ Grill a try.",

We badly needed a break and a place to just sit down, eat, and talk about something else.  When we first entered, the hostess, a blonde older lady, already had a crappy attitude. We'd come in two cars and there was a little confusion about whether my friend's husband and son were already there. The hostess was very snippy with my friend, I suspect because my friend is a larger lady. We let it go.  Brisket sandwiches and some catfish: flippin' awesome. Our actual waitress was nice enough, thankfully. Desserts were consumed in spite of being stuffed from the nice entrees.  When we finished we sat a bit and talked. The hostess approached and brought a bag for the leftover boxes. It was clear she wanted us OUT. My friend asked for water and the hostess said hotly, \"To GO?\" My friend said no, and that hostess was preeeeetty huffy about it. I don't know if she's the owner's wife, or what, but someone who thinks she can behave that way to customers needs to be spoken to.",

    "text": "I am so confused by all of the ratings. I've tried this place twice now hoping that things would be better and that I just ordered the wrong items but I was, yet again, very disappointed. The only thing this place has going for itself is that they have large portions.  As for the food, it should be called Tex\"ass\" Grill!  First time I visited, my boyfriend and I ordered the ribs meal. The ribs were dry and extremely salty. The sides weren't any better either. Their potatoes were bland and coleslaw was over-dressed.   Seeing the highly rated reviews on their Chicken Fried Steak, I hoped my most recent visit would bring redemption to this restaurant, but, boy was I wrong!  Their Chicken Fried Steak was bland as was their gravy and mashed potatoes! They didn't bother to season the meat and it seems like it was just dredged in season-less flour batter. The gravy was flavorless as well.   I really wanted to like it but my taste buds fought against me. I felt dirty trying to take another bite because I kept trying to fool myself into thinking I tasted the meat... or the batter... or the gravy... or the potatoes. My last bite of redemption... the biscuit.... which was also flavorless! What happened to buttery, flaky biscuits? They would be well inclined to consult the Pillsbury Dough Boy for some pointers because those taste 100% better.  Disappointment and empty stomachs filled my household for the rest of the evening. At least something was full.",

But then my husband ordered his steak, fed me a bite and I remember being startled because it was fresh - not frozen. You could TASTE that it was not frozen. Probably the first restaurant I've been to that didn't have pre-frozen fried food. It's also beer battered. Flippin' delicious. It's basically like going to a southern mama's house and going for a home cooked meal.",

    "text": "Their chicken fried steak is enormous. It is literally hanging off the sides of the oval plate. My problem is that there is just a stripe of meat in between two thick coatings of breading. On its own, it's very bland; but with the gravy and variety of condiments on the table it comes to life. I suppose it's a matter of taste; but I would prefer the option of a traditional, smaller, thicker, piece of meat with the same breading and a little seasoning. The mashed potatoes are real and tasty as is the corn. The biscuit is... OK. Seating is cramped and most seats are occupied. Wait staff is personable.  They do a good business. I left full; but still craving a traditional chicken fried steak.",

I'm still not quite sure who he was but everyone was amazing and friendly from the moment we walked in until the moment we left. Our server was like a second mom, doting on our boys and always making sure we had everything we needed. I chose this restaurant for my birthday dinner because I knew we'd be going out with our two small boys and thought it would be a fun experience for everyone. I ordered the chicken fried steak because that is what they're famous for. It was a gigantic and I could only finished half of it. I would highly suggest if you don't have a Texas size appetite to do the half order or split it with someone. A little detail to most but a big thing for me was that they served green olives chopped up on their dinner salad and I loved it. We will definitely be back. My only negative on this restaurant is the lack of parking space, but this is a common issue in the central Phoenix area.",

Well, that changed when dear papa took me there for dinner after picking me up at the airport about 6 years ago. Since then,  I've been to Texaz one or two times a year and....still haven't tried anything except their chicken fried steak combo, always with a Shiner Bock Bohemian Black lager.  It's perfection. Eventually I'll try something else, but why tempt fate?",

My husband and I can split a chicken fried steak dinner, and still have some for breakfast the next day! I'd say that's worth the $17 a plate price, for 3 meals. Parking can get a little crazy, try going for happy hour during the week before 6 for dinner. You will get $2.25 bottles of Shiner Bock and a parking space! If you do go and can't find a spot to park, don't give up, the food is worth the walk. This place is also super family friendly. There is just enough noise for you parents with younger ones to not feel bad if the kiddo gets noisy. Their kid's menus are Armadillos that you can color, cut out, and fold to make 3-D. The friendly host was telling the kids jokes, and asking Texas trivia questions. Adults without kids, not to worry, there's a nice comfy bar stool waiting for you in the back!",

I would have preferred something lighter, but I am telling you that if you want a hearty meal in a very colorful setting  this is the place.    The menu is largely steak and fried foods, but you get a salad and potatoes with every meal.  They do give the options on some of the foods - pork chops, chicken, shrimp, fish - to have it grilled if you please.  Special of the day was liver and onions, which we all passed on.  I decided to go whole hog, and got the bear battered fried shrimp, our son got chili as well as two fried chicken breasts (he is a construction worker, so can eat like this), and my husband got the grilled pork chops, with  big sides of grilled onions and grilled mushrooms.    The service was excellent and the food very good, although maybe not the best choice for the night before Thanksgiving.   The decor, if one could call it that, was the most fun of all - walls and ceilings plastered with old advertisements (haven't even thought of Nehi in years), letters, pictures, license plates, and on and on.  It was a lot of fun, but back to salad and lighter things.  Except tomorrow for turkey day.",

The building is cool, lots of old stuff all over, almost feels a little cramped, but for an old spot, that's to be expected. The menu is very small, Chicken Fried Chicken, Chicken Fried Steak, T-bone, and sometimes ribs on special. Everything we had was yummy, however the coleslaw was a bit on the soggy side for me. The ribs were smoked to perfection, fell right off the bone, and the chicken friend chicken was great. Service was exactly as you would expect it to be, nothing to write home about.
