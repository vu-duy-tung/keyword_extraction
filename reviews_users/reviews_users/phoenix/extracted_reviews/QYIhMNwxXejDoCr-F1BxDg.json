We went anyway, which is rare because I am stubborn about those things, but the pictures looked really good. When I walked in, they just stared at me. I had to ask for a menu. And water. It was so weird. We joked that you must have to be a regular or VIP to get attention around here.. When the food came, no doubt it was delicious. The ambiance is nice, but I'm not going to go out of my way to go here again because it felt like I was intruding on them or something.  They earn stars for: high quality food, open late, parking. They lose stars for: bad service, no liquor license.",

The veggies were cooked just right and tasted fresh while there was also plenty of tofu. Very pleased with the flavor of the food here.  Location is small and started to fill pretty fast.

Anyway,  The owners and staff here are so freaking nice. Customer Service is such an important element to dining, that a lot of places overlook, and these folks do it well.  Traditional Thai offerings in a very relaxed, clean (thank you), and simple atmosphere.  This is the only Thai Basil, of the local chains, that makes Pad Prik King and other \"off the menu\" dishes -  so I keep coming back to this particular location.",

Pad Thai is one of the measures of a good Thai restaurant.  If the Pad Thai isn't made well, it makes me question the rest of the menu.  The noodles and ingredients are fresh.  If you get the prawns, they are delicious and huge!   I've had several different curries.  I think their Masaman is my favorite.  The service has always been pleasant and quick. They have a lunch special, price is great. 4 stars only because it's really a small place, and tables are pretty jammed up close together and the parking can be pretty much the same.",

The food was ready quickly, and we could both tell the ingredients were very fresh. And the portions were huuuuuuge! I ate most of my food but still had enough to eat leftovers for dinner. It was about $30 for 2 people, to give you an idea of price; the portions made that price well worth the money.  Our server was also so friendly! I think she was smiling the entire time, even before we got there. What a ray of sunshine! =) We recommend this place, and will definitely be back.",

I was the jerk who recommended the place... we were humiliated when we asked to see the prices per plate we ordered. $40+ for lunch. For THREE people, no booze.   We'd ordered from the lunch menu. Had the daily special. We politely asked about the bill and the outrageous price. The waitress returned with scrawled lines, different prices, and it was still $40+. Nothing itemized. Of course we still tipped her, however, it resulted in a fight about it in the parking lot.  Normally, I wouldn't even care to post this review had we not been in a few times prior, tipped extremely well, were kind, polite to the staff... they pretended to recognize us... but we had always ordered off the printed price menu. Should that even matter?!  Buyer beware? Pain in my butt the rest of the month and beyond trying to live down the embarrassment. And now my group refuses to ever give Thai Basil further business-- which leaves me to grovel, find a new Thai place, etc. Sorry but I still feel cheated. Probably from the constant reminders.

The menu is easy to navigate and the wait staff are eager of offer suggestions.  I have tried a few items and seem to go back to chicken dishes.  The portion sizes are proper for lunch and I am generally out in 30 minutes or less.  They have excellent sauteed vegetable dishes along with curry.

I actually love it! It is cozy, relaxing, small and very neat inside, with a tiny hint of a fast-food ambiance. Nonetheless, the food is so delicious and usually comes pretty quick!   I've ordered the chicken green curry, red curry, and also a sauteed plate/platter. I was always so satisfied and feeling like I've reached nirvana! Their curry is just right, creamy, flavorful and has the right amount of heat (I always ask for medium, and it always comes a bit milder than medium, but I still love it!). Also the veggies seem so tasty, crisp and fresh!  With about $10 a plate, it's one of the cheapest/most delicious meals you can have! I ALWAYS take some leftover home! And even then, I eat the leftover in 2 settings!",

The restaurant looked a little small for my liking, but the staff members were really nice to the customers and the food was absolutely delicious. I ordered the green papaya salad - mildly spicy, and vegetarian stir-fried chow mein. I usually don't enjoy salad at a restaurants, but I have to say, the green papaya salad was delicious. It was a perfect blend of sweet, sour, and spicy. The different levels of crunchiness from the grated papaya and lettuce worked well together. I really enjoyed it. The chow mein was also delicious as well. The food lacked presentation, but the noodles were chewy, just the way I like it! The spicy/sweet sauce went well with the noodles and the stir-fried vegetables. The veggies were stir fried, and were perfectly cooked, without losing their crunch. The best part about the restaurant was that I did not have to wait for a long time for the foods to be served; it was served almost immediately. The food tasted really fresh. The portion size was also quite big, so I was not able to finish it all by myself. I enjoyed the overall experience, and am definitely going to come back again with friends and family. The food at Thai Basil was a little pricy, but it is absolutely worth it. I would recommend others to try Thai food at this restaurant because it gave me a good impression on Thai food.",

Their curries are particularly good.  I've had a number of dishes there and I have never been disappointed.    They ask you how spicy you would like your meal.  The spiciest option has a nice flavor and a bit of a burn, but it is not overwhelming.  Lunch specials costing around $8 come with a spring roll and soup.  Dinner is slightly more expensive.",

The food was great and the service was fine. I have read reviews here that the service is poor, which I personally did not witness, although the place was packed.  The only complaint I have is that there wasn't enough rice for me - then again, I am sort of a pig when it comes to jasmine rice.  Would recommend Thai Basil if you like curry/Thai",

    "text": "Oh yes. And the search for the best Thai establishment in the valley continues.   As usual, I was craving Thai tonight. Not that this is really a surprise. I wanted something decadent and full of flavor, spices, and heat. Due to talking I believe, we passed Thai Elephant which is what I intended to try and instead hit Thai Basil.   I do have to give them props for having a seriously cute interior in a small plaza establishment. I was told that it's usually packed, which might've scared me considering how small it actually was. However tonight it was pretty slow.   I ordered cashew chicken hot. The sticky rice was perfection and the cashew chicken was definitely hot. However, I didn't get all the flavor I have from other Thai places. I left wanting a little more in the way of flavor and spices. However, the dish was very fresh and healthy.   I'll probably give it another try. Hoping it was just the dish I chose that was lacking spice and flavor.",

The tofu itself was really good -- sliced thin and very lightly fried so it had a nice hearty texture.  The dish wasn't exactly piping hot though.  There was some confusion with the salad.  We tried to order the dressing on the side and were told that that wouldn't work because it really needed to be mixed in.  We said fine, just go light on the dressing.  The salad arrived some time after the main course, with a huge bowl of dressing on the side, as opposed to lightly mixed in as we had agreed on with the waiter.  The dressing was very liquidy and kind of a mess, so it would have been better mixed in.    The place is very small, just one little square room so you never manage to forget you're in a strip mall.  The prices are reasonable and we had no difficulty getting in on Sunday night.  If I lived closer maybe I would go back.",

    "text": "Thai Basil straddles the middle ground between Pei Wei and Malee's on Main.   The prices are probably the most memorable thing about this restaurant.  At $6.95, Thai Basil might be the cheapest Thai dinner I've had.    The food is good also.  The vegetables are fresh, the sauces and curries are powerful and tasty.  As some others have noted, the biggest problem with the food is that there's nothing to say about it.  It's not bad at all.  In fact, the Thai Basil Chicken and Spicy Noodles were both quite good.  However, they taste much like every other Thai place I've been to.  The food is good, but not a standout.  I will offer one complaint.  The restaurant is small.  Too small for the number of tables and waitstaff.  The result is a relatively cramped feeling.  Last time I ate there, my company and I were hustled out of the restaurant to make room for more patrons.",

    "text": "I went to Thai Basil by myself today for lunch about 12:30. Ordered Peanut Curry (Panang) with tofu and no broccoli (personal preference) and a thai ice tea.  I got to choose my level of \"heat\" - I said \"as hot as possible.\"The total came to just under $10 and less than 10 minutes later my food was ready.  Panang is one of my favorite thai dishes and its typically the first thing I order when going to a new thai restaurant.  Thai Basil's version of it had a thick sauce, which I love, and the tofu seemed to be grilled or cooked in some way that gave it a nice firm and chewy texture.  The meal also comes with rice (I took mine white) and a spring roll with that spicy clear-orange dipping sauce.  It was delicious.  The vegetables that came with the panang were big hearty pieces that were well cooked, not too soggy or hard.  The thai ice tea was thick and yummy, an excellent way to wash down the panang.  That being said, for ordering my dish \"very hot\" it was not all that spicy.  I'd say it was moderate, but I have a high spice tolerance.  I was surprised to see there was seating available in the peak of lunch hour, and next time I go, and there will be a next time, I'll bring some friends and grab a seat. The seating inside the restaurant is kind of cramped, I had to scoot out of the way to let the waitress's pass when I walked to and from the counter.",

    "text": "You know i was going to give them 2 stars at the very very beginning...Honestly i was. Why only 2 stars you are most likely wondering.  To start off to give you a little idea is that i was born and raised in the bay area for almost 22 years of my life on nothing but the most amazing Asian spots to eat at with the best flavor and all.       Luckily i did find a Thai spot out here in hot dry Arizona which does not happen to be Thai basil obviously.  Second off i happen to be a huge foodie and let flavors sit to get the full experience. Thai basil lacks A LOT of flavor because everything was so watered down.        I asked for mild panang curry and my friend ordered the mild pad thai.  i was expecting some sort of spiciness given the fact that i had asked for MILD and not  MEDIUM. I shouldn't have to order the hot to get more flavor out of it wouldn't you agree?? something in between spicy and no spice? it would make sense...but thai basil failed that miserably on the flavor aspect and spiciness lots of points missed there.       Now we had got there 5 min after the lunch hour meal deal had ended but we did not want huge dinner portions at the time so we had asked very politely if it was possible if we could order the lunch meal instead. The manager, I'm assuming agreed and brought us out some soup to start. The soup was not bad since we were starving at the moment and i love tofu so okay onward with my review.  Shortly after they had brought out my awaited panang curry which looked to be quite soupy and full of veggies which i do not mind. What matters the most is the consistency and flavor. Which you should have an idea of how the flavor turned out but it gets worse. As i poured some curry over my rice and go to eat a spoonful i am quite used to a spoonful of curry to cover the rice with enough flavor.  This was not the case here. i had to basically pour a whole bowl of curry onto a small tiny cup of rice to get any flavor of curry over my rice. :(        Thai basil had screwed up my friends pad thai and brought out her piping hot plate a couple minutes later hers was not even tinted with any redness we should not need to add more hot sauce when  we asked for mild we expected mild. We were more than happy to get the lunch special than a huge dinner plate because of the fact  that we should not have to pay so much for HORRID(cleaned up word for what i would like to say) food. We were definitely complaining but don't you think  you would also if you were to see a rating of 4 stars out of five on a highly reviewed Thai place?  My other friends pad see ewe? was lacking of all flavor apparently in 85% of the dish and said the rest was bland.         The employees were giving us the dirty eye the rest of the time when they realized how much we hated their food. When they brought us to go boxes we didn't need i just told my friends it was pointless to pack the nastiness up when we really wouldn't be eating it later. They agreed and asked for to go cups for our thai tea instead the employee came back and slammed the cups down and walked away continuing to give us dirty looks. TERRIFIC. So freaking what if we dont like your disgusting food. Everyone has a right to their own opinion. and this was 3 reviews in one.           We did NOT leave a tip because the employees were not helpful or considerate since we did not enjoy their food in the slightest. it was not worth my 10 dollars because i ended up having the worst stomach pain for 12 hours straight and bubble guts for probably a good 7-8 hours in the beginning. gross, i know.  I would like to give them another chance but after my 12 hour long incident i really don't want to risk it. I will continue to go to my beloved thai rama when they are open that has to suffice until i go back to the real deal in San Francisco, Milpitas, San Jose or Tracy, CA.",

Some places it just looks, off, and smells, hmmmm off, but this particular place it is just \"fresher\" I don't know how to describe it. This place serves as my standard for pad Thai quality so yes, good food and love it.  Also, ordered the fresh rolls many many times. The ones with avocado (girlfriend doesn't like meats) we have had many times. Huge and very yummy. I like the open end with the lettuce hanging out, nice touch because you can see that the fresh roll is in fact \"fresh\" before you even bite into it. Love it.  Recommended!

There seemed to be a bit of a language barrier,  but an employee should be familiar with their menu.  I received a large side of albino egg noodles, plain. The ingredients in the main dish were pretty good, but they were so far and few; literally three pieces of bell pepper.  The description says everything is cooked In a spicy garlic sauce,  so when she asked me what spice level I wanted I said medium. Medium at any other thai restaurant would mean a good heat without burning my fave off.  Apparently here medium means they don't even use any sauce.  Dry rice and tiny pieces of other ingredients is what I received.   As if that weren't annoying enough,  the girl at the register was rude and wouldn't even make eye contact.  Sorry you hate your job but I never made you work here. Passible food and terrible customer service will keep me from returning.",

As soon as you sit down they place a small bowl of soup in front of you (it's basically broth with with carrots, celery, and cilantro). Nothing spectacular but it gives you something to do while you wait for your food.   My favorites are the fried rice with chicken, BBQ Pork and the Red Curry, most dishes are served with rice, veggies and a small springroll. It's not blow your mind Thai but it is fast, decent and pretty cheap. I go here monthly for lunch.",

The soup that came with the lunch special had unusually sweet broth. Unfortunately, this carried over to my entree as well. I love pad thai, but I could barely eat my dish because the sauce was cloyingly sweet. I ordered medium heat which was very mild so adding some extra chili sauce helped combat some of the sweetness.  My husband got the green curry which he liked, but not nearly as much as our neighborhood place. The portion was pretty small, and he left hungry.  We were happy with the quick service during a busy lunch hour. I wouldn't come back here though.",

I cannot say that about most of my experiences with trying Thai food in Arizona (I am a picky eater though). I LOVED the red curry with chicken, as well as the chicken salad and the fresh spring rolls. Their peanut sauce is delicious!  While I enjoyed most of what I ordered, I did not love their chicken satay. Perhaps it would taste better not delivered? I do not know...The chicken texture did not do me it for me. The pad thai also was not fantastic. However, I will definitely be a customer in the future, as I loved most of the entrees/appetizers I tried and I am thrilled I discovered this place (thanks to Yelp).",

    "text": "My mom & I stopped in here for a quick lunch on our way out of town.  The place itself is tiny & crowded into a small strip center.  Parking was pretty tricky, too.  It was a Monday right around the lunch rush (we have a talent, what can I say?), but we managed to find a table pretty quickly.  A waitress had drinks in front of us pronto & we browsed the menu.  I requested a Thai Iced Coffee & it was quite delicious.  I tried out the Thai Basil Signature which boasted chicken & lots of veggies.  The lunch special also came with a spring roll, so that seemed like enough.  I requested it to be extra spicy (as I always do at any Thai restaurant) & ended up with the same result: nowhere near spicy.  When I asked for the spice tray, I got a sideways glance, but I'm used to that by now.  The dish was quite good - a nice balance of flavorful chicken and fresh vegetables.  And the spring roll was great, especially with the dipping sauce.  Yum, indeed.  I couldn't eat everything, but I tried, dangit.  There was no point in a to-go box because I had picked it over so much.  I'm a fan of anywhere that stuffs you full of well-prepared food, is courteous, and gives you a cheap bill.  All the better!  Since the place is so small, it wasn't hard to get our server's attention, so we never lacked for anything.  They were basically friendly & obviously intent on getting you food & drinks quickly.  I'm definitely a fan & will return on my next trip.",

Cute little restaurant in Bicycle Plaza, clean, service is ok- pretty good for an Asian restaurant. :)  I love the Spicy Noodles with chicken, papaya salad is what I always order, tom yum soup (need more seafood ;), the lunch plates are delicious and you get a little bowl of soup before your meal.

It costs a bit more but it doesn't matter because it is so good.  The only problem is that I ordered it too spicy.  I went with the Thai Hot and it was a bit too hot.  I'm going with medium next time.  *Cashew Nut Sauteed Plate w/ Chicken - excellent and full of good stuff.

I told her I loved it and she asked what I typically ordered. She offered guidance in ordering with dishes that may be similar to what I normally get but decided to go with a starter of Chicken Satay and their special for the day Roasted Duck Basil. I appreciate the effort on the part of the waitress to get me food I will like. While waiting for my meal I saw that they have really made the best of the small space with covering part of the window front area with decorations and the ambiance is warm- it's very comfortable and inviting- they keep the temperature cool. Others who have ordered curry have adorable serving pots which lends to a \"sharing\" aspect but also is cute.  I got my Chicken Satay and the meat was cooked and seasoned beautifully and the peanut sauce was sweet and savory. Served with cucumber and onion pickle. VERY GOOD. last time I had Chicken Satay like this I went back the next night (in Puerto Rico) haha! My main dish was very good. I got it in the mild spice range and heat level was what I would expect after requesting. I haven't had duck very often so I don't know if I don't like duck or what. The vegetables where good. Cooked perfectly and the portion is large! I enjoyed myself so much that I decided to only eat half of my meal and go for desert also. It pains me I came here on my last evening. As I wish I could come back for the chicken satay at least once a week. Thanks for a great meal!!",

The veggies don't really contribute anything to the dish. They just seem to be a space/stomach-filler. They needed to be steamed longer. Potatoes were still hard and starchy.  Check out Wild Thaiger. A little more expensive but definitely worth it.",

I love love love this place!  Recently had the masaman curry with tofu, at a medium spicy level, and was so pleased that I vowed to return again the next day! The lunch combos come  with your main dish, a spring roll and rice. Next time, I will have to try the Thai Iced tea.  Fast and friendly service, clean restrooms, a really sweet Thai mom at the counter all make Thai Basil well deserving of 5 stars.",

The curry is creamy and has alot kf flavor and the pad thai is really saucy and has a good meat portion and good amount peanuts. Just awesome, love this place you really need to go",

They have some of the best curries I've had in the Tempe area.....not too heavy or greasy, just the right amount of coconut flavor and spices! (the eggplant is really good....they pan fry it separatly for guaranteed flavor and no mushiness!)  They also have some rockin' spicy noodles (always a popular dish at our table when we dine with friends) and the pad thai is pretty good too.   This is probably one of the more expensive thai places (not crazy expensive, just a little higher then others around the corner), especially for lunch....I don't find the specials that special (expect to pay around 8 to 10 a plate). Service is pretty good....we never have dry glasses or anything. I probably helps that this location is pretty small, your waiter can't disappear for very long!",

    "text": "Ate here a couple of weeks ago around noon on a Saturday.  Upon entering the place, we were pleasantly surprised by the cute atmosphere.  The waitresses there are pretty friendly and served with a smile.  Our party of three ordered from their lunch specials:  * Spicy noodles with pork   * Spicy Thai basil with ground chicken  * Eggplant with tofu  The portions were huge, considering that it was lunchtime.  We ate family style, so I was able to taste all three.  We requested all three dishes made spicy, and in terms of the level of spice, I rate them as medium-spicy.    The spicy pork noodles were flavorful and moist, the Thai basil chicken was good (not great), and the eggplant and tofu dish was kind of flavorless.  The cook could have left out the broccoli and bamboo, and added a bit more ground chicken and basil to the Thai basil dish, and it would have appealed to me more.  We ordered two Thai iced teas and one Thai iced coffee.  The drinks came in long, tall glasses...well worth the price for each drink.  The Thai iced tea was good, but the iced coffee was too sweet and had a weird aftertaste. Oh yeah, they serve this cabbage and tofu soup (flavorful) as a pre-courser to your entrees.      Overall, the food was good for a quick lunch, but nothing to write home about.  The price for each dish was around $7-$8.",

It was a cute little restaurant and I loved how it was set up. They decorated with a bunch of Thai knick knacks, and played very relaxing music. It was altogether a peaceful place to eat unlike most restaurants that are loud and obnoxious.  I never knew that I liked Thai food until I went to Thai Basil. The food tasted so fresh and it was presented very well. They always start you off with a fresh bowl of soup when you first sit down which was of course delicious. Everything I ate was amazing and i felt healthy and satisfied after eating.  All of Thai Basil's  staff were super friendly to their guests. They always gave you what you asked for and didn't make mistakes. The only minor improvement they need to make was their communication using English. I think it would really enhance the restaurant if the servers could really have a conversation with you and they could interact more.",

The pre-meal soup was a mediocre broth vegetable soup.  Nothing too exciting but not too bad either.  I could take it or leave it.  I ordered the Green Curry lunch special - Thai hot, which she warned me was \"very hot\".  The curry came out quickly (almost too quickly - meaning the ingredients were thrown together and not allowed to marry) and it was spicy indeed , but not too much so.  The meal consisted of the curry itself, an egg roll, and a little bit of rice.  The egg roll was tasty and the curry was fresh and full of vegetables.  I do wish the veggies were a bit more cooked and the flavors of the curry ingredients were more combined, and that more rice was served with the meal.  Overall very satisfied with my experience with Thai Basil.  My rating is more of a 3.5.  A place I would not go out of my way to get to, but also a place I would go to again willingly.",

I decided to drive up and order carry-out since I'd been running errands and just wanted to be home with food.   There were a few occupied tables which surprised me for 4PM on a Saturday, but the busyness did not delay my order [note their good hours!]. I was welcomed by all of the gals working and given a menu, as well as giving a note about their of-the-day dinner specials. My go-to for any new Thai restaurant is Pad Thai not spicy [normally 0 or 1], to figure out their hotness scale. The cashier noted it would probably take 15-20 minutes or so for my meal, but when the bag was brought out I noted it had only been like 10 minutes!  Got home and dove in- Pad Thai was delicious and not terribly spicy. Couldn't hardly finish my meal since there was so much food they gave me. Definitely worth a return trip soon to try something else a little spicier!",

I guess we came during rush hour... But I got lucky and found a spot so everything was fine :)  Service was great super fast and friendly staff. They refilled our water constantly too!!   We got chicken pad thai and red curry chicken! Both mild haha.. I like the sweet and salty taste and a tiny hint of spice... Maybe one day I'll try a spicier kind.. But anyways.. Enjoyed it so much that I can't wait to eat my left overs!!  I love pad thai!   And the curry was pretty creamy tasting even if the soup it self doesn't have the creamy consistency..  Idk thai food is just kinda addicting lol...  Totally just realized We forgot to order dessert :( but next time!!  Can't wait to come back!  4 stars for parking!!  Portions are family size and definitely for sharing!!",

There was only two waitresses, maybe that's why. Our waitress was very sweet. Unfortunately my food was a little cold by the time I got it.   We ordered Chicken Pad Thai and Tofu Pad Thai. Both were very yummy despite to temperature. The portion size was nice-perfect amount of leftovers and a pretty good price. Just under $10.   For dessert we got mango on sweet rice with coconut drizzle. The dessert was amazing! Highly recommended  Their Thai tea is delicious! They don't give free refills on lemonade.   The location is really nice. Right in the heart of Tempe. However, if you are going with more than a couple people, maybe try a different spot.",

The service wasn't great and the food was okay but not amazing.  I arrived around 2:00pm to try the lunch menu and the place wasn't very busy; yet the two servers weren't very friendly or welcoming. I've never had Thai Iced Coffee (only Thai Iced tea) so when I saw it on the menu I asked if I could try a small sample of it to see if I liked it. The server said no they don't allow samples, which I thought was kind of rude. Later, she gave me a hard time when I asked to add a little more tea into my Thai Iced Tea because it was way too sweet.  The complimentary soup was very sweet and had an unusual but pleasant flavor. Presentation of the food was nice and portions were descent. I ordered the red curry lunch special and the abundance of vegetables in the dish were nice. The curry itself was flavorful but not groundbreaking. I think my favorite part of the meal was the complimentary egg roll which was crunch and flavorful.   The food here was good but not great, and with the lackluster service, I think I'll go back to Thai Elephant before returning here.",

I'm going to suggest that the potatoes for yellow chicken curry be cut into smaller pieces, you're feeding people, not horses.  Otherwise the super good I don't care for the soup in the little bowl that they serve you when you first coming.  I don't know what it's called but I think I would rather have it egg drop soup.

Not to mention the vegetables were cold and hard when they were supposed to be steamed to perfection.

I typically get the Panang Curry with chicken but also really like the Drunken Noodles and Pad Thai. Every time I've gone with someone else they've enjoyed their meal as well. The veggies they use always seem crisp & fresh, and the spice level is always on point. If you ask for mild, it really is mild, if you ask for hot, they really bring on the heat!  My only note is that during lunch and dinner hours it gets really busy, and while they have parking in front of the restaurant, it fills up quickly. If you're going to get something to pick-up, I suggest going at an off-time so you don't run into any problems with that. Either way, the wait and parking pains are worth it!",

I love the avocado spring rolls as an appetizer and the peanut curry for an entree. I always ask for a side of extra peanut sauce because it's so good.

The Thai Tea comes in some tall glasses and I just  love the contrasting colors of the tea & cream till I swirl it and blend it all up! This Thai tea was delish too!  We went with the crab puffs as starters; they were simple and good for starters.  For my main dish I went with the massaman curry, Thai hot!  it was chicken bathed in massaman  curry with coconut milk, carrots, onions peanuts & potatoes and hit with some heat! It also is served with steamed jasmine rice.  This dish was delish! It was creamy, hot and full of flavor!   Service was great and friendly glad to have stopped by and given Thai Basil a try.",

On my last visit I ordered Rama's Favorite, and I found it to be inedible.  It tasted like boiled beef in a peanut sauce that was somehow laking the peanut flavor....gross!

I've made Thai curry (or at least my hubby has) and it had a much thicker consistency with a stronger coconut flavor.    Other dishes are good and they are reasonably priced. If I ever have to go Phoenix again for business (and I hope not) I will stop by this place.    One other thing, usually Thai places have a spice rack, this one didn't have one. I'm used to have a vinegar mixture of garlic and thai peppers, some hot chili flakes, some soy sauce with ginger and green onions and jalepenos.",

To start with, none of the dishes in their appetizer sampler actually tasted like Thai food.  It was just fried/grilled things with a side of peanut sauce and plum sauce.  I ordered their Pad See Ew, and I don't know if they used different noodles or just didn't cook them long enough, but they were smaller and a different consistency from what Pad See Ew normally is.  I also asked for it medium spicy, which at a Thai restaurant should mean it carries a moderate risk of death.  It was extremely bland; I think I've eaten bacon that was spicier.  So to summarize:  not bad, but not authentic.",

While the red curry was pretty good, it definitely was not hot, so get the extra hot if you are serious about your spiciness.  Service was prompt but note that they do not have a liquor license so don't ask for booze.  This was a great, quick place to grab some dinner but falls a little short compared to other Thai cuisine I have had.",

The Red Curry is a must-try!",

Stopped in last night with my girlfriend for a dinner break from studying. Just wanted a quick bite to eat and got much more.  The menu was large and honestly hard to choose from. After several minutes trying to decide on a choice, I struck up a conversation with a friendly patron to my right and she recommended the egg noodle stir fry with chicken. Trusting her, I ordered it and within 5 minutes I had a large, hot plate of it sitting in front of me. At the same time my girl landed herself some fried sweet potato skins with a delicious dipping sauce.   Both of use enjoyed every last bite of the meal. We topped off the dinner break with what else for a college student on a study break?!? The Thai Coffee. It is served iced and taste somewhere between chocolate milk, and burned coffee. Sound kinda weird? well it kinda took me by surprise, but we enjoyed every last drop.   Since this wonderful, new found Basil explosion is so close and I will definitely be back soon. Maybe tomorrow...  Btw... I heart basil",

I saw the mixed seafood plate which comes with shrimp, scallops, fish fillet and squid.    I asked my waiter how it was prepared.          He answered, \"in a sweet and sour sauce.\"   Me: \"sweet and sour sauce?\" (incredulously)          Waiter: \"Well, mostly sour sauce.\"  \"Are you sure?\"         \"No, not really.\"   \"Can you please go ask?\"  I ended up ordering it as it usually is prepared in some fantastic basil/thai chili paste sauce that I love.  It arrived, just as advertised, in a lemon, fish sauce, chili-flakes concoction.  The scallops pieces were microscopic, the few squid rings were rubbery, and the fish fillet was gross--all on a bed of lettuce to distract you from the real size of your $13 or$14 entree.  The sauce was as simple, and uninspired, as explained to me by the newly-informed waiter.  The amount of fish was disappointing.  The sauce was below average.    I am only giving this place 2 stars, instead of one, because if I lived here, I might be forced to return.  There don't seem to be many Thai restaurants in the area.",

    "text": "(Disclaimer: I don't know much about what authentic Thai food tastes like, having never been to Thailand... But here's my subjective opinion of Thai Basil.)  I just moved nearby this place, so I've been a few times over the last couple weeks. It's pretty good-- I've been in a noodle mood, so I've tried the spicy noodles, pad see ew, and pad thai (all with tofu). The spicy noodles were alright, but I was surprised to see they were made with skinny (linguine-width) noodles... Back home in NY, similar dishes always came with wide noodles.  But the flavor of the spicy noodles was pretty good, and I appreciated the generous amount of basil (makes sense, given the restaurant's name).   Thinking I could assure myself wide noodles the next time, I ordered the see ew. But no! To be fair, they were wider, but still only about one cm wide-- where are the awesome monster noodles I love so much? It tasted ok, but didn't really compare to my favorite versions from home. The sauce was kind of boring, and it had normal broccoli instead of chinese. Eh.  Giving Thai Basil one more shot, I went back and got some pad thai for take out the other day. Now, this is where they shine, in my mind-- it was quite yummy, with lots of crushed peanuts and scallions and an overall a nice balance of flavors. The tofu was also fried just right. (Full disclosure: I did add a dash Thai fish sauce to the dish at home, just to pump up the taste a little bit...It doesn't seem to have any of those little dried shrimp bits in it, sadly, so I figured the fish sauce might help compensate for the lack of brine. It worked. Wish they used the dried shrimp, but this will do for now.)  The inside of the restaurant is pleasant by Tempe standards (as I've observed them so far), and the service was quite friendly both when I dined in and got take-out. It's the kind of place you could feel comfortable eating alone or with six friends, no sweat.  So that's the verdict-- decent Thai, certainly edible enough to satisfy a craving without leaving the neighborhood. Earth-shatteringly good? No. But the pad thai will probably end up being a frequent order for me because of the convenience factor. Now if only they delivered...!",

Good food, good portions.... sums up the food. The service was marginal with my requesting for water and all, but the guy was nice and gave us some free rice upon my price inquiry.  I will most certainly be returning, hopefully to more hospitable service, and hope to soon refer to this as \"the place I always go\". I definitely advise Thai Basil to anyone in question.",

The food is always good - has a very fresh flavor, well spiced, and nicely prepared. They're happy to accommodate dine in or take out (which is fun, especially because the bar next door doesn't mind if you eat Thai while drinking craft beer :D), and the staff has always been very friendly and attentive to me and my friends. Brought a friend who is originally from China but has traveled to Thailand and he enjoyed the food as being fairly \"authentic\" and really liked the dessert with mango and the purple sticky rice. For me it's all about the Silver Noodles w/ Chicken MMmm! *Though make sure you clarify if you want the soup or the plate dish as they have mixed my order up before*  Also, if you like it spicy, HOLY MOLY can they do spicy here! Weak-tongues beware, don't ask for that highest level unless you got a big pitcher of thai iced tea ready to go!  Compared to other Thai restaurants I have tried nearby (thai elephant, etc.) I think Thai Basil has better food, nicer staff, and better prices. It's not quite as \"classy\" since it's a pretty simple place, the food/plating is taste over ostentatious presentations, and they're usually rocking some jazzy covers of pop tunes on the stereo by the front door, but I haven't ever considered myself a classy guy :P   4 stars, totally recommend!",

Seriously someone needs to change their name and differentiate themselves.  No alcoholic beverages at this location, so no Phuket beer for you!  I wonder how they make the drunken noodles here.

If you need a quick Thai fix this will do the job.  However, if you wish to be wowed and powed; I suggest moving on.  My friend ordered the tofu fried rice and she really enjoyed it so I guess it could be a hit or miss, but still I'm the one reviewing haha!

    "text": "10,000 hours to be an expert or 10,000 grains of rice to be a regular. I'm not sure which I would prefer when talking about Thai Basil, arguably the best Thai restaurant in Tempe. Although the area around ASU is inundated with local independent Thai spots, Thai Basil is the hottest (Sorry 5rcha, Thairama, and, Thai Elephant). In fact there are more than five indie Thai spots in the square mile are Mill and University! In a small sample, and quite casual, taste test with a few of my close colleagues, we found that Thai Basil not only has the most flavorful yellow curry, but it also has the freshest and best textured veggies to accompany their superlative sweet and spicy coconut base. The atmosphere is always set to tame lounge covers of pop songs, and mood lighting that settles the agitated or overwhelmed. An order of fresh rolls with the perfect hint of mint accompanied by a mellow rendition of Katy Perry's \"I Kissed a Girl\" is enough to make the wrong day right. Not only are they open until 10 p.m., which makes that post nine o'clock \"where do we go\" purgatorial discussion of fast food options fade, they also will carry your order over to Taste of Tops if you want to enjoy a your Thai dream in another seemingly moonlit establishment that offers the best in draft beers an absurd bottle selection. The close by Tempe Farmers Market adds to the convenience of the location as many post dinner trips home are made complete with grabbing a few of those household necessities you've been meaning to get while you are out, or if you just want to sneak a quick vegan treat. The service is impeccable; I've never had a complaint let alone even heard a complaint about any of the staff or quality of the food. The one lone soul who spoke out against getting a bite there a few weeks prior was advocating we get Jack-In-The-Box on Mill, so you know their taste buds can't be trusted.  The only problem that has ever arisen has been finding a parking spot, (literally one time out of dozens) which was quickly remedied by available street parking on Farmer. I will say the neighborhood and location are above average in general \"cool feel and vibe\" but if the ambiance is not to your liking, their take-out service is as convenient as any I've seen. The neighborhood part mostly goes for the University location, but the rest can be generalized to the other two, which I've patronized both and they maintain the standard set by their University site.  I am not sure how one would be an expert at Thai Basil, as I previously suggested would be possible in my opening line, but over the years as I've slowly made my way into the \"regulars\" club with my idiosyncratic fried rice order, I know I wouldn't trade that status for anything. Maybe for some free entrees. Wait nevermind.",

Oh was i so sad because i was looking forward to good thai. Fresh rolls were ok. Not amazing just your standard run of the mill fresh roll with some peanut sauce made probably from jiffy peanut butter which btw is not a good thing. Never going back.",

The restaurant is very small and the tables are close together, but it is always packed - which is a sign of how good it is. We both ordered the pad thai with chicken, medium spice - and even that was fairly spicy. Pad Thai is not the most adventurous meals, but it is still one of my favorites. A side of Thai tea and I was very happy.   The service was good and the food arrived quickly. Two orders of Pad Thai chicken, one Thai Tea and a water = $17.29. Get there early to get a parking spot!",

We were a party of four and ordered one appetite(~$8), four dishes (~$12 each)and four desserts(~$6 each). I expected the bill to be around $80 before tax. To my amazement, the bill came at $120 with no details. Puzzled I asked the waiter for an itemize bill. When the bill came again, two things struck me: 1.) it went from $120 to $110; 2.) a gratuity was already included. Mind you, we were only a party of four and the last time I checked it was only customary to add gratuity for a party of 6 or more.  The worst part was the service we received was the very minimum and service people were close to being rude. With the difference in the bill their only comment was math is never my strong suit. Really? That's how you run a business? Needless to say, I will never go back to a place where it is run with no business ethics.",

The reason I am only giving 3 starts is because the past few times I ha e visited this location, the packaging has been off. I always order the garlic eggplant and tofu. This is a sauteed meal topped in a delicious garlic sauce. They put the mela into a carton that you put rice in. The issue you may ask? These cartons aren't meant to hold liquid. My food didn't even make it home before the carton got soggy and the liquid spilled into the bag(pictures attached). Do they do this with curry as well? Just seems a bit strange to me. Would definitely recommend if you plan on dining at the restaurant. Not so sure about take out anymore.",

There is just the right balance of base (broth) and coconut milk - so creamy, a little sweet, and as spicy as you can take it. I used to get it with beef, but the Rural Rd location started using (apparent) lower quality and now I've switched to Tofu. I like that the veggies (onion, potato, carrot) still have substance to them. Not undercooked, just right. I realize these two locations are separated now, but I still consider them under the same umbrella - and this one was the original.  Service has always been great for sit down or take out and their Thai tea is excellent.   Seriously, I pine for this place while living in Austin.",

    "text": "I know there are some people who will argue, but for me, this Thai basil is as good as it gets for Thai food in the valley.  The trick however, is that it must be this specific Thai basil.  When I moved out of Tempe I tried the Thai basil downtown and eventually every other location they have and none compare to this one.  Their curries have more flavor, they give you more rice, and the people there are extremely nice.    This place was a staple for me while I was in college, and whether I was coming in alone for a quick lunch, ordering pick up for dinner, or coming in with friends, I have never had a bad experience at this place.    Their green curry is my favorite dish and they have a good range of spice to satisfy whatever mood I'm in, or whatever wimp I'm with who can't handle the heat.    In addition to their main courses, they have excellent complimentary miso soup at lunch time, and tasty spring rolls on the side of every dish.    I usually can't pack in dessert after polishing by heart portion of curry, but if you are feeling indulgent while you're there, try the F.B.I. (Fried Banana Ice Cream).  Its a great dessert that's delicious, but not overly sweet on the tongue.   I highly suggest you try this place out, it is a guaranteed great meal, but do not think you can stop at any Thai Basil instead, they are not carbon copies like most restaurant chains.",

I was introduced to this location a few years ago from a co-worker and haven't been able to find Red Curry as sweet, creamy, or fresh as theirs anywhere in the Valley!   While I highly recommend the Red Curry with Chicken above all other dishes; their Green Curry is also excellent and comes in at #2 for my favorite and #3 is definitely their Spring Rolls. The best part about the Spring Rolls is that they come with a very light, sweet and spicy, yet flavorful dipping sauce. I am not sure what kind of sauce it is exactly, but the consistency is a perfect pairing.  Besides the great food, they have very quick service; it's perfect for take out or dining in! Friendly staff and very clean. I highly recommend this location if you're a Curry fan!",

It was basically the free soup that they serve before the meal and they charged $7 for a bigger bowl. Not a value!   Overall, this place is delicious and generally a good value.

Despite this flexibility I tend towards the red curry. I get this as hot as they will make it with out an argument ensuing, which is usually pretty decent on the heat scale. It is a great medley of crisp vegetables in a creamy coconut milk base red curry. The tofu is the fried style which adds an interesting textural variety to the standard tofu.  The lunch specials come with a small salad, a small soring roll and a little slice of watermelon all in the $7 range.   Service is decent, my water received frequent refills as i tend to drink quite a bit with spicy food.   Parking here can be a bit tight at high times, and there also may be s small wait. If there is a wait go to the liquor next store to find an amazing beer selection.",

It's a good thing the server took my order before I had a chance to wait much longer- the noise level was driving me up the walls!  Sure, it was during lunch, but I've been here during dinner, too, and even though there were only four or five tables going at that time, the noise level was high.  Veggie soup with tofu came in a small bowl.  Lightly-salted, fresh-tasting, perfect to get the juices flowing.  Soon after, a plate with jasmine rice, an oval bowl of green curry, and a small eggroll arrived.  Took a bite of eggroll and was disappointed to see * in the mix.  This is the first time I've seen * in eggrolls served in a Thai restaurant... Thai coworkers tell me that's not the norm.  (Another inauthentic dish served here is their pad woon sen- silver-bean noodles with veggies, tofu/chicken, and egg.  TB serves it dripping with sauce when it should be on the dry side.)  Curry sauce was good, but looked too watery and not silky enough.  Medium-spiced, perfectly light.  However, the noise level, soggy pad woon sen, and eggrolls with * will keep me away.",

Lunch specials come with a small egg roll, that is quite good, rice, and a light cup of soup. Their scheme of spiciness is quite accurate in my opinion.  The Panang chicken was quite good, with more vegetables than I am accustomed to.  The red curry was tasty, but the beef was pretty chewy.  Guess I'm spoiled by the Thai in Los Angeles.",

They are definitely interested in getting to know their patrons. That makes a big difference to me! The food is always, always fresh. I love how the carrots are scalloped, and obviously never frozen. Fresh green beans, jiminey, I could go on and on! You can't go wrong here. It is a chain restaurant, but the owners have made it their own. I love to go here.  Can't go wrong!",

This is one of the first (budget) places in the valley where I ate great crab meat, and, they also made sure they told me they use imitation carb (for its consistency) in some of their dishes. Shows they care for their customers tastes.  Their curries are creamy, stir frys yummy and the service is good without being too intrusive. You can taste the freshness in the ingredients, and, the earnest flavors in every dish.  My personal favorites - - Pad see eew - Eggplant Garlic with crab meat - Purple rice pudding with fresh mango - All their curries are creamy and flavorful - try them with salmon, I promise you won't miss meat",

I like how they categorize the menu by flavor and you can pick your protein which varies in prices (chicken, beef, pork, tofu, shrimp, squid, salmon, red snapper, or seafood (shirmp, scallop and calamari)).  --Thai Ice Tea - Large $4.50 - The biggest Thai iced tea I've ever had.  It was good to the last drop! --Chicken Tom Yum Soup $10 - Expensive for soup, but good value because the portion is huge and can serve 4.  I wish they had an option for a smaller size. --Crab Puffs (6 pieces) $6 - These crab rangoon were on the skinny side, but they were tasty. --Thai Basil with red snapper $13 - This was a great dish and the red snapper was nicely cooked. I love that there was a lot of vegetables in it along with the fish. --Pad Thai with chicken $10 - Perfectly cooked noodles and delicious!

Sometimes they understand, others times $1 extra, next time $2 extra (plus sales tax).   But you can't expect foreigner Asians to understand that. In their culture, apparently you can charge new prices on the fly for the same dish.   Good news is that they seem to have installed a reverse osmosis water filtration system as their water now tastes purified.   The dish is good, but sorry, $14 is too much for lunch. They also seem to have trouble keeping staff, as there is nearly always someone new there. And, they exclusively hire Asians. I like Asians, but where's the love for everyone else?",

I would highly recommend the Thai Basil (signature dish) or even the chicken pad Thai medium spice. Drinks here are excellent, especially the Thai Iced Tea.   Do not pass this place up for food.

I also really love the light and delicious veggie soup they start you out with! The food is perfect every time and the service is delightful. I am definitely a happy regular, I have to come in at least once a week! I have since tried their Pad Thai Noodle and Green Thai Curry. I didn't think anything could come close to the Red Curry but I must say the Green Curry was out of this world as well!  I am often served by a young man named Arty and he such a sweet heart. This place really shows how much they appreciate your business and how much they care about what they do. I am proud to support such caring people and their business. If you are in the Tempe area, I HIGHLY recommend trying Thai Basil! It is, no doubt about it, my new favorite restaurant!",

I've had better peanut sauce, but other than that it was very tasty. We ordered silver noodle soup with tofu and all shared as an appetizer, omg, so so so good!!! MIL got the green curry with shrimp and said it was very good. My kids ordered the Thai fried rice with brown rice and chicken, they loved it. I ordered the chili vegetable platter spicy. Very good, lots of veggies and it was nice and hot. My husband got some grilled fish platter, it came with shrimp and scallops, he was a little confused that the scallops were raw, but loves sushi so it was ok.   Overall, I would say we had a very yummy dinner and will be back.",

I've been here probably 30+ times with family and friends. Most importantly, my first date with my girlfriend of 5 years was at this very spot. She's the most wonderful person in the world but that doesn't mean my 5 star is biased.  This place's food quality is GREAT. Very fresh vegetables that are crunchy and colorful, great Thai iced tea, and well cooked rice. The tofu never disappoints, but I am partial to the beef. My favorite dish is the rama, which is basically a vegetable (and your choice of meat/tofu) saute with a nice, creamy peanut sauce (available on the side for dipping or smothered on top of the dish). Great stuff if you're into sweeter entrees. I also highly recommend the red or green curry.  No alcoholic beverages here (at least I don't think they have them) but their food has much more focus because of this. The servers are extremely friendly, too.",

    "text": "Swung by on a Wednesday evening for dinner with 2 friends - not too many people around, probably because ASU hasn't started yet.  We all ordered the pad thai with protein variations (pork vs. chicken vs tofu). It's a pretty decent sized serving, and I did like how for our \"real-meat\" versions they added some pieces of tofu. There was a good protein ratio, but my pork was a little dry :( I also asked for it to be a 4 on the spicy scale, but it wasn't spicy at all. One friend ordered it at level 3 and another at level 1, but they tasted the same.  Overall, cheap food with good portion sizes, but nothing very special. If I go back, I'll definitely ask for more spicy! Everyone is very friendly and super attentive.",

Usually I manage to finish just half the dinner portion but as the flavor was so good I stuffed myself to the max and finished the whole serving!  Only issue was that I told the server I want less veggies and more tofu with Thai hot spice level but I received the curry with Thai hot spice and more veggies with less tofu. I had to ask them to either change the curry or add more tofu - to which they helped by adding more tofu so I was happy!  Also, as it was closing time and we weren't done I'm assuming it was the owner (lady) who specially came up to us and said we can take our own sweet time to finish our meal, no need to hurry and that she is going to be there even after the register closes. I found this gesture really sweet and warm. Thank you!",

    "text": "I've eaten here a few times and each time some how my order does not come out right.   I ordered Thai fried rice, sweet and sour pork and spring rolls via grub hub. My order arrived pretty quickly, I opened the bag to find They had messed up my order again. Granted this time it wasn't a huge mistake of the order it was Thai noodles instead of Thai fried rice but I'm not a noodle guy hence why I ordered the rice.   I think the most frustrating part of the whole ordeal was how it was handled I called in to let them know of the mistake and they  said I put the order in wrong I went back and looked at my order and most definitely did not, she then said the lady must have wrote it down wrong, but the driver was busy so I would have to come pick up the Thai fried rice. So I just spent 8 - 10 bucks to have it delivered to have to go pick it up anyways? I kind of explained that to her and she said she would make a note and I could get a free appetizer next time again this is now the 2nd or 3rd time this has happened I feel like an appetizer next time seems a little underwhelming. She was very nice but the whole expectation of what I should have to do to fix the situation was extremely frustrating.  Anyways I would definitely not order delivery and if you order take out double check your order.   The food is good and would recommend if you dine in only in case there's a mistake you can get if fixed.",

I don't think they have much coconut milk with their curry, but there is some sweetness to it. but overall decent curry that you can finish without leftover. \"hot level is not too hot.\" This first time I came here, I had the thai spicy, which if I recalled was really thai spicy hotness. I prefer something between the hot and thai spicy. But may need to try the thai spicy again next time.   Lunch special - comes with a side of soup and egg roll w/ sweet and spicy sauce.   average lunch price around $8.95",

The curry was SUGARY SWEET which I can not for the life of me understand why. It was completely inedible. The pad thai was alright, but seemed to have thicker noodles and less chicken than you receive at the Rural Rd location so the last few times that I have wanted Thai, I've gone there instead. I hate to have all of my positive experiences ruined by one really bad dinner, but I prefer to dine somewhere that is trusty and reliable with their dishes.",

Anyway, we went for lunch and had the pad Thai as well as the pineapple fried rice. I liked what we had because it had the typical flavors that I was expecting. For the pad Thai, it had more of a brown sauce on it than the orange sauce that I sometimes see at restaurants. I think I like the brown sauce better because it is more authentic and not ketchup flavored. For the pineapple fried rice, it had cabbage, broccoli, carrots, white onion slices, green onion pieces, cashews, raisins, and pieces of pineapple in the rice with a curry flavor. The beef wasn't chewy and I liked that, but it was a tad dry. The chicken was also a tad dry. Overall, it was the typical Thai style food that I have come to like and enjoy.",

Love the intimate atmosphere created by the low lights, soft music unobtrusively playing in the dinning area and the medium stained woods and browns of the decor.  The food is fresh, tastes amazing, and even when they're super busy, comes out fast. I think this is the best Thai I've ever tasted.   The staff is always friendly and seem good about anticipating the needs of their customers.   Tonight, my friend from out of town ordered the glass noodle soup with tofu and I had the green curry with tofu. He really liked the food and managed to finish his soup even though he had some of my curry and he typically doesn't eat much. He said it was so good he had to finish it.   He even suggested that we come back again some time while he's in town! I will definitely be back and will try to bring my friend one more time before he leaves.",

I got the lunch special BBQ Pork, with fried rice, and a thai ice tea.  Got the veggie soup, it was salty and very peppery.  Ok, moving on to the lunch plate it was the same as before but the taste of the sauces is watered down or something,  It was just not as flavorful as I remember!  The egg roll was meh, diffent than the thai egg rolls I have had before at other places.  The Thai Ice tea was the only thing that had good and strong flavor.    Maybe it was a miss today?",

I LOVE Thai food and Thai Basil was not a let down at all. This restaurant was priced well and the food was very authentic and delicious! I don't really have anything negative to say about it at all. If you are an ASU student or live near ASU and feeling Thai then I would recommend trying it out.  The service was excellent and fast. I had a very good experience here for my 1st visit. I do anticipate after 1-2 more trips I will be editing this review to 5 stars.   Zero complaints, much praise.",

    "text": "A renovation...looks to be different kitchen and wait staff as well...tho the wait staff is needing a little contact with regard to acceptable and appropriate daytime restaurant service attire.  There has been a renovation...and the space has certainly been improved.  With about 60 seats in the room, the colors and varying heights/spacing of the tables  of dining areas make for what feels like privacy.  On arriving 11:30 AM on a Thursday, I was gratified to see about 40 people in the restaurant.  With no sign about seating self or waiting, I caught the eye of one of the waitress' and she directed me to a seat not far from the kitchen/main service area.    I sat and received both water and menu.  Double-sided, but only lunch menu...no indication of the salad I wanted.  From previous experience as well as menu of other Thai Basil around the Valley, I know the staff has the ingredients and knows how to make my papaya salad...Som Tom.  If you have seen any previous review, you know that Som Tom is julienned green papaya prepared with thai chili, fish sauce, garlic, fresh-squeezed lime juice, tomato and palm sugar.  The salad is frequently offered with green beans, shrimp or salt crab.  It may also have julienned carrot in small portion.    When the questionably attired waitress came to take my order, I requested Som Tom and steamed rice...ordered Thai hot, no green bean and no shrimp.  She wrote down my order and turned to tender my order.  On to the phone, checking email and news, occupying my time until lunch arrived.  The salad and rice were presented to me in about 10 minutes.  What appeared to be a very large portion of papaya salad, about 3 cups, was an illusion.  The salad was placed on top of a pretty large amount of lettuce, which I did not see until I had taken a few bites of the salad.  I figure I actually had about 1 1/4 cups of papaya salad.  Spice was 5 (makes my nose run, while 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes).  Rice...a pricy portion, 1 cup, fresh and well presented.  Just kinda hurts to have to pay for rice that is a traditional accompaniment.  No windows on the west side means comfort for afternoon and early evening enjoyment...  With regard to  the questionably attired waitress, what is going on with the denim shorts not fastened in front, hanging off the backside...netting and a t-shirt that does not meet the waist of the denim shorts...it leads me to wonder about the cleanliness of the presentation.",

Never fear, I take good notes while I eat so I can remember the specifics.    When I eat Thai, I usually get satay and the Pad Thai.  I do that for two reasons... 1.) cause I like satay and Pad Thai 2.) to keep it consistent when I review.  I have something to compare it too.  Thai Basil's Pad Thai was very good.  The prices was reasonable too.  If I remember, I think I ate dinner and was stuffed for about $17, including my iced tea.   I would certainly recommend Thai Basil for anyone going to Phoenix or the Phoenix area. I believe they are a local chain.",

I'm a huge yellow curry fan, and I gauge Thai restaurants by the quality, flavor, and textures of their yellow curry dishes. Never before have I eaten such a creamy YC. This renders the curry flavor very slightly less...curried...but I find myself going back time and time again for their take on this classic. Having eaten at lunch and dinner times, both in-restaurant and takeout, you will get a cheaper lunch that's overly filling, or for a dollar or two more a dish that'll last you two meals at least. Parking can be hit-or-miss, but I do love how close Thai Basil is to Tops!",

I like that the restaurant is situated next to Taste of Tops because I can simultaneously enjoy a nice brew, some delicious green curry, and a board game.

I won't fail to mention that I now work within walking distance from LGO, Radio, and Chelsea's.and deluxe is only a few miles.....  The atmosphere isn't that great, and the service is spotty.... (they do offer to go)  If you go for lunch, either come early or late, don't try to hit it right at high noon, or you'll be waiting (sometimes outside) for a while.  The thai iced tea is good  Their lunch specials are well priced and come with an egg roll (which didn't ever have corn in it, but this might be something new) and usually starts off with soup or salad (i think they rotate soup/salad depending on our seasons) The pad thai is nutty and good. I REALLY wish they had a Green Mango Salad with Dried Shrimp, but...If you don't know what to eat, then try the thai basil (their signature dish); it's always a good fall back if you don't like......  THE CURRY.  The curries. Ahhh - these get their own paragraph.  I've never been a huge fan of yellow curry (don't like the potatoes...) but their red curry, sweet nut curry (which is red), and green curry are phenomenal. In a class of it's own is the green curry.  I am in love with the green curry. You can get this green curry with tofu, chicken, beef, pork, or shrimp. I usually get it with tofu or shrimp, but I've had it with chicken and pork, and both are great.  If so inclined, TOPS Liquors is located in the same plaza. They have a wonderful selection of beer..but that's a different review.",

I've had terrible or mediocre experiences with some Thai restaurants in other cities, but this place is excellent. I recommend the signature dish, Thai Basil, as well as their Pad Thai and Red Curry. There are multiple locations, including Central Phoenix and Ahwatukee. If I have anything bad to say about the restaurant, it would be that the University location is pretty small and when the Fall or Spring semesters at ASU are in session it can get packed quickly.",

Their Pad See Ew is amazing and their curry is awesome as well. This is actually the only place where I can even eat the curry (all other curry I've tried has been disgusting), so it's possible they make it slightly differently.  Their prices have gone up slightly in the past few years, but it is still very reasonable money-wise. Overall one of Tempe's best restaurants, I'd say.",

My husband and I went the other night, he got the special which was the Thai Basil with lamb, and I went with my always favorite spicey noodles with chicken! The Thai Basil was full of flavor it made mine taste whimpy in comparison, but I will always love the spicey noodles! The waiters and friendly and try to get you a seat as soon as they can even when its packed on a friday night! 5 stars from me!!",

Nothing wrong with that since many of the clientele are not Thai. I ordered the Thai Ra Na which is supposed to be flat noodles stir fried with Chinese broccoli & meat, and served with brown gravy. Dish came out and made with regular broccoli and the did not have brown gravy. Noodles were not the traditional flat noodles. It tasted ok but not what I expected. In addition they do not serve sticky rice which Is a must for a Thai restaurant. First Thai restaurant I have been too that did not serve sticky rice. Staff was very nice and spoke Thai well. They explained that do not get very many Thai clientele and made their food more American style since 80% of their customers are Americans. I can't blame them for that but Americans love authentic Thai food. I think they need to serve authentic Thai food and it would help their business. I recommend this place for anyone that wants simple fried rice and chicken. If expecting authentic Thai food then this place is not the restaurant for you.",

    "text": "Does anyone remember when Mill Avenue used to be a fun place to hang out? Yeah, neither do I, but I've been told from the horse's mouth (sorry to call you a horse, Mr. Man) that it used to be a hip and happening place with plenty of small, custom shops and dives instead of the now ubiquitous mega-corporate whorebaggery. Luckily, you have only to travel a little bit further west on University to steep yourself in that old school neighborhood feel.   Thai Basil gets big stars for being one of these homey neighborhood joints. Along with El Pollo, Tops, Tempe Bicycle, HTC, Otto's, Headquarters, Buffalo, etc., this locally owned restaurant has consistently provided inviting ambiance, wonderful service and delicious food for pennies compared to anything on Mill.  I just finished my leftover red curry chicken just before I wrote this, and it was every bit as savory and rich as it was last night (just make sure to put the leftover sticky rice in a plastic bag or it'll get crusty). The fragrance and flavor of all their curries (red, green, yellow, and peanut) is if not unmatched, pretty damn close to the best offered at any Thai place I've dined. Thick, al dente, crinkle cut carrots, bamboo shoots, green beans, broccoli, zucchini, red and green peppers with tender choice of meat afloat in savory coconut milk that suspends the perfect amount of earthy spice and hot chili to ensure that the meal dances on your taste buds.  My favorite dishes aside, just about everything on the menu at Thai Basil has proved to be exemplary. The Thai Basil is their signature dish and certainly doesn't skimp on its namesake fresh basil and thick flavorful sauce. The Pad Thai is sure as hell better than what's offered at Bamboo Club, with ample crushed peanuts and noodles that don't turn into a puddle of goo once the dish cools. The Garlic Pork has a lighter sauce that still manages all the fragrance and flavor of its more syrupy counterparts. The papaya salad is crisp, citric, sweet and spicy, an excellent accompaniment to a rich meal. Or try the crispy spring rolls that manage to be filling despite their humble size. The chicken satay with peanut sauce is also a very good choice for picky eaters (or kiddos), although they'll truly miss out on the more complex flavors of this amazing food.   Thai Basil is a fairly small restaurant with dark wood tables that are all very closely spaced to ensure the maximum number of people can be seated. There is booth seating along the back and stretching the length of one side, while high tables and chairs are located in the windowed area facing Farmer. The decorations are sparse but complement the overall Asian feel, with bamboo accessories, knick knacks and family pictures decorating the walls. The richly colored, metallic embroidered skirt/pants worn by the waitresses are also for sale if you're looking for something special to spice up your wardrobe.  Despite its small size, I've never experienced the long wait times that others have when I come here. The servers have always been very attentive and quick to refill a glass or take my order, and are honest with their opinion when asked what they enjoy on the menu. I don't generally go here on busy nights though, and the hours I attend are either early or late evening, so maybe I avoid the hectic rush, because the kitchen is pretty small. At least you know you're getting fresh Thai from the folks who know it best as a result. If you don't have a lot of time to wait and just want a quick dinner, it's also possible to phone in your order or walk in, order, visit the shops around the restaurant and return in ten minutes to a piping hot order.  Try out the lunch specials! They're a great deal and they get you in and out within the hour. Although this is the one time of the day I've been when it's a bit on the slow side, since the entire restaurant is always packed. But the crowd is oddly well staggered since I've never seen anyone waiting for a table. For about eight bucks you get a small salad with tangy sweet vinaigrette, a spring roll with sweet and sour sauce, and your choice of dish with a ball of rice on the side. It's usually enough so I have one extra lunch leftover, compared to the two lunches I usually have with the regular dinner dishes.   One thing I've noticed over time is that their \"hot\" really isn't that hot, so if you like it spicy, make sure to specify.   Thai Basil is a comfortable neighborhood restaurant that attracts the type of customers Mill Avenue only wishes it could, loyal ones. As Mill whores itself out to the highest corporate bidder, I envision the property owners diving through coins like Scrooge McDuck and doing their best impression of Mr. Burns'. But the obscene retail rent checks signed reflects the boost in product price and the blandness of corporate hegemony. It's a relief for this starving-but-no-longer-student to support a local eatery by driving just a little west of that circus.",

The food is decent and the interior is nice, but the tables/diners seem to be squished elbow-to-elbow New York style. Spartan, but slightly upscale, this restaurant ALWAYS seems to have a wait.    The yellow curry here is my favorite with a delicious balance of coconut, spice, carrots chicken and potatoes.  I can't ever seem to get enough, and I really mean that.  The portions here are small, and while lunch portions are expectedly small, portions elsewhere (at Chanpen Thai, for example) are larger and less expensive. Elsewhere the Thai BBQ chicken comes with 1/2 a chicken, but at Thai Basil they give you three lonely strips like cheapos!  The massaman curry and pad thai are pretty good too, but I feel they're just OK.  I've had better.  Service is hit or miss here.  One thing that's consistent: they always seem to be understaffed. Once when I was dining alone (at a 4-person table) they had the nerve to ask me to move while in the middle of eating, to a 2-person table.   To me, Thai Basil is style over substance.  Not impressed.  Next.",

Aside from the flaming hot veggies, it's pretty good on top of the jasmine rice.  The great part is, they give you more than enough to take home...and it's not bad cold either.  Asian food is never bad cold the next day *grins* The ice coffee and thai tea looks awesome...little too spicy for me. of course they choose to open one right next to my old dorm AFTER I leave.

    "text": "OK, I'll get the bad stuff out of the way first.   Thai Basil is pretty decent Thai food, but it gets frustrating when each time you go, the story is always the same: a really long wait for any food to appear on your table.  Considering it's not a fancy, hoity toity sit down place, this is a little unusual. Even soups and satays take around 25-30 minutes. There may be only one cook doing everything the back kitchen, but they need to sort this out because at least something to munch on (appetizer/soup) should appear in front of you within 15 minutes of giving your order.   That said, now the good stuff.   The food is pretty decent. Not amazing Thai, but not mediocre either. And when you ask for the food to be spicy, they don't just nod their heads and then ignore your request. They'll routinely make it spicy to order. I've had their special Thai Basil Chicken, as well as the red, yellow, green, and masaman curries - and they've all got good flavor. Service is friendly, and waters will constantly be refilled, and if it wasn't for the food taking forever each and every time, I'd give the service a really high rating.   The restaurant itself is clean and not too big (strip mall setting), and you've got your Tempe undergrad/grad student/older folks mix of patrons about.  All in all, I'd give the food somewhere between 3.5 to 4 stars, but the wait is what holds the overall rating back at 3, unfortunately. I'd definitely recommend their food if you're in the Tempe area, as again it is decent Thai, but either order it to go or be in the mindset for a very leisurely lunch or dinner (ie. come up with some good conversation topics with your companions).",

I really cannot complain about anything.  I loved my garlic vegetable dish with chili sauce and chicken.  The atmosphere was great and the place was very clean.  They never did ask if I wanted anything to drink, but I overlooked that since I was satisfied with water.  Prices were very reasonable....I really don't have anything negative to say. (there is a switch)  Now I have a new place to have lunch....",

The food is very good; the signature dish that gives the restaurant its name is my favorite.   Thai food is traditionally spicy. You know this. You expect this. You want this. On my last visit, I ordered my food at the \"medium\" level, and it was not spicy at all. Certainly not \"Thai medium.\" Are they holding back?   Plus, Thai always makes the BEST leftovers. I purposely save a portion of my dish every time just so I can have it stew in its own juices for 24 hours and reheat it the next day. YES. ...Is that weird?",

I usually rotate through my three favorites - the pad thai, the thai basil and the thai basil seafood. Every entree is served with a bowl of soup, a generous portion of rice and a small but tasty eggroll. it's not uncommon to have leftovers or to head back to work stuffed.  The place is small and tends to fill up at lunchtime but we've never had to wait real long if we have to wait at all. The service is quick, we can get in and out in under an hour.",

    "text": "Discovering Thai Basil has been one of the better restaurant experiences I've had in Tempe. Unlike many other restaurants so close to ASU, Thai Basil is not part of a chain or simply college food. The prices are reasonable though, and the place always seems packed with a diverse-age crowd. Sometimes this can be a problem as Thai Basil seems a little understaffed in the kitchen, and I've had to wait a half-an-hour for appetizers to appear at peak weekend hours.  It's always worth the wait though. The Tom Kha Gai Soup is excellent, as are the calamari, fish, and noodle dishes. I like to explore a menu, and I've never been disappointed here. Unlike some Thai places I've been, Thai Basil serves up nicely-sized portions, and they do ask (as seems to be the norm out here, but not back East) at what level of spice should your dish be prepared.   Easilly the best Thai food I've had in Tempe, I would heartilly recommend Thai Basil even if it's slightly off the Mill festivus.",

My friend sneak a bit from plate and almost threw up, he couldn't take the hotness. As we were leaving he said he was 'breaking a sweat' as his mouth simmered down from my chili garlic.

I usually get the red curry- the vegetables in it are cooked just right and their vegetables are always fresh. The yellow curry is perfect with brown rice. The Thai iced tea with sweet cream is amazing.  Their sticky rice and mango is delicious- they make it with the purple rice. Unique and satisfying!  They have a great appetizer combo with satay chicken, fried tofu, tempura sweet potato and spring rolls. I sometimes order this as my meal. Their Pad Thai is perfectly put together. They add the right amount of sauce, unlike some place that drown the noodles with sauce and all you taste is sauce. The veggies on top of the noodles are fresh and tender. Lastly the papaya salad- awh is perfect as well. They add the jumbo shrimp on top along with wedges of tomatoes",

Most recently I had ordered a simple Pad Thai with Shrimp. What I got was rehyderated rice noodles and two pieces of shrimp and tofu. There were hints of vegetables but no sauce what so ever and noodles on their own taste like soggy cardboard I have recently found out. I am a terrible cook but am confident in that I could have made better Pad Thai than what I was looking at. This is the straw that broke  this camels back. R.I.P. Thai Basil",

    "text": "For some reason I've just recently made it over to Thai Basil after finding out that our regular Tempe Thai restaurant (Thai Rama) had closed.  The good:  - Great flavor for green curry. Asked for medium and it was a medium spice.  - Prices- 2 curries, plus rice and one Thai Iced Tea was $24 + tip.   - Atmosphere was fine, not too big at all (I'd call ahead for larger groups). Service was good as well.  - Thai iced teas are HUGE! Get a small. If you get a large it comes in pretty much a large beer mug.   The bad: - Yellow curry was definitely lacking spice and flavor. I asked for a medium as well, and the spice was maybe a mild. I ended up mixing with my dad's green curry - Vegetables were undercooked and quite hard (esp. carrots) - Chicken was extremely dry. Usually dry chicken in curries at least have the ability to soak up some of the curry liquids; this chicken was very, very dry.   I'd go back again- but wouldn't take someone there for their first Thai experience.",

I went here with my brother in December after hearing rave reviews from him for years. When I saw the special sign outside say \"pumpkin curry\", I knew my life would never be the same *cue lovey dovey music here*  Place was small, but cozy and nicely decorated. Waiting staff was very attentive, and probably eyed me for drinking so much water haha.   So back to the curry. Normally I'm not the biggest fan of thai curries and prefer an indian curry mostly, but this was perfectly sweet and savory. Everything about it was perfect, I kid you not! Salad, rice, chicken curry. Beautiful.   And now I'm back in Michigan. le sigh.  So go here and experience the greatness. Prices are not bad, parking is plentiful, and a good place to bring a date, or a sister, as it turns out :)",

We picked up food to go, due to working in Phoenix, but spent a few moments observing this small restaurant, that apparently has quite the impact!  Every table was full, and I saw the working crowd lunching, students taking advantage of their leisure days, and probable regulars.  I can see why! Nestled in a corner, steps away from Top Liquors, this place is endeared and slightly off the beaten path!  Parking was an issue, so be aware.  Before I mention the food, I do have to state the atmosphere is very Thai, and it is designed with touches of artistically crafted wood that I felt was imported from Thailand.  the main woman behind the counter was charming, and warm.  Its a fast moving joint during the lunch hour, so grab a menu while you wait in line, and be ready to give your order! I cannot wait to sit down and enjoy the ambiance more!  NOW onto the food, it is brilliant Thai cuisine!  I ordered the Yellow Curry with Chicken at a medium heat.  It was spicy, but nicely so, and was delicious! I am glad to have left overs to enjoy another day! And the spring roll app was a little nugget of goodness, which I didn't know I was receiving.    They have a few locations throughout the valley, whether you're in Tempe or Chandler, and in the mood for Thai, check them out for sure!",

The food is always tasty, and service is great!  My favorite is the Red Curry (red pepper, bamboo shoots, carrots, green bean, basil in coconut milk base soup) with Chicken (I have at least ordered 5 out of 6 times I was here, it's that good!!!), and I usually have it in medium spicy. I ordered this again for tonight's dinner, and we also tried the Fried Banana and Ice Cream with Honey for dessert, sweet and delish!!",

    "text": "I can't believe I've not written a review for Thai Basil yet but I went there last weekend for dinner with a friend and it reminded me I should!   I saw another reviewer mention large portions and I want to second that, you definitely get enough to eat with a huge bucket of rice (I normally end up with lunch for the next day too!) And the food is delicious. I like spicy food but am a bit of a baby with what I consider \"spicy\" so I normally order the mild dishes and they're plenty spicy enough for me. Spicy or not, the flavor combinations they have (which you can customize with what type of meat/fish/tofu you want) are mouthwatering.    The prices are decent too so you won't be blowing too much cash on dinner/lunch - and like I said, you'll probably get leftovers for another meal as well.",

A nice blend of sweet and heat, but not overpowering. Nicely done.  Small place.  Not noisey, even when busy.  Take out busy. Looks locally owned.  No alcohol on menu, which I think is a plus because such places have to really focus on food.  May be more than one location.",

    "text": "I seriously hate this place because of FOOD POISONING! My co-worker and I decided to pick up some Green Curry w/ chicken for lunch. The lady on the phone was able to persuade me to get the dinner serving for just $2 more. I agreed and when I went to pick up the food I was pretty impressed with how big the containers were because I thought I would be able to save half for dinner. I was very wrong. We barely ate a quarter of it and both of our stomachs started hurting really bad and than later in the day, I threw up. I called Thai Basil after work to let them know and the lady was very rude. She said it couldn't have been their food and it must've been something else that I ate because they just make a big pot for the whole day. I let her know that my co-worker also got sick and she just blew me off. She asked me what I wanted and at that point, I did ask for a refund since she was rude and didn't care. I hate asking for money back but if the customer service isn't there, than I will ask. She said they can only give me half of my refund back and nothing else. I picked up the money the next day and thno one said a single word to me about the situation. They just handed me the money and turned around.",

I usually order the Thai Basil (their signature dish) and it is so good every time. There are quite a few Thai places in the area and this one is my favorite.  One suggestion... the place is pretty small.  If you are going at a lunch or dinner rush time I would not go with more than 4 people in a party.  I've seen people come in groups of 6 or 8 when it's busy and it really slows things up.  The Thai Basil on Rural (not far) is quite a bit bigger.  Go there if you are in a large group.  Great food there too!",
