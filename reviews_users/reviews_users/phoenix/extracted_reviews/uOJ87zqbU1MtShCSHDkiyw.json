    "text": "I took my daughter and her boyfriend to Va Bene for dinner on Easter. I would have taken them to a nice brunch but they both had to work until 4 o'clock. I read some great reviews and I read some horrific reviews so I decided to come up with my own opinion. We were created promptly by the waiter who seemed as though we were a bother more than a customer. The food runner and busboy were on point they were pleasant. We ordered an appetizer the calamari it was different it was thin rings with a sauce which was very good. It was odd that the waiter took our appetizer and food order together. My daughter and her boyfriend both ordered the pasta with vodka sauce and I ordered the veal Picatta.  The pasta was a hit and so was the veal though both portions were very small. The veal was $25.95 and in my 38 years of going out for dinner I never paid that much for so little. The meal was served with mashed potatoes set on the plate with an ice cream scoop and the vegetables were under cooked. I can honestly say this was the first time I left a restaurant hungry.  To finish the meal I ordered the cheese cake if it was made with ricotta cheese the waiter informed me he was not sure how it was made let me check the box. Really check the box even if it did come in a box don't say it. I informed if it is not ricotta cheese I will have the cream brulee. Well the food runner brought out the cream brulee. We never asked if we wanted coffee. The decor reminded me of the Italian restaurants in Chicago in the old Italian neighborhoods not for the food quality and portions but the decor.  Just a note to the owners don't cut the veal paper thin skip the mashed potatoes and offer a side of pasta and make sure the vegetables are cooked.",

The patio area had a lot of smokers, so they told us we could sit in the front where it was non smoking... They hostess took us out front and it was completely unlit. She brought us a candle, which did nothing. We moved over to the other side of the patio which had a little more light. The patio seats' webbing was broken. We had to switch them with other tables on our own. I later saw other customers also finding broken seats at their tables.   Our waitress was friendly. The food was decent, but not fantastic.  I had the ahi tuna. It was unmemorable.  My friend had the pollo alla pizzaiola which was tasty. But overall, not worth the price..",

I can't rave enough about the food but the service is disappointing. It is extremely slow - I waited 45 minutes for a drink and over a hour for my meal. We've decided that takeout is our best option which is too bad because the ambience is inviting, warm and romantic.",

The service is horrendous - aside from being slow, they are not the friendliest folks in the world.  Instead of having 2-3 hostesses sitting at the front desk twiddling their thumbs, put them to work and have them refill waters and clear tables because the wait staff and bus boys can't maintain the level of service there once was.  The food is sub-par - I had to return the Carpaccio because it was truly disgusting.  We had 6 people in our group and there were 3-4 separate checks for the group.  Why are they adding 20% gratuity on each of the checks for a party of 6.  Unreal and uncalled for.  The ceiling needs work - there are huge open vents with freezing cold air blowing through them.  Hope they can get their act together, or they will lose their client base.",

Recommend sitting in the lounge and enjoying the live music, but you will probably have to get there early in order to get a table or a spot at the bar. We always get the Calamari. I like to order the sauce on the side because it gets a little to greasy/heavy with it on top. We've had several of the pasta options and never had a bad meal. My favorite is the Alfredo with mushrooms. So much yummy goodness and you'll have some leftovers to take home. The service is excellent and it has a romantic feel, but not stuffy. Excellent for a date night. Keep an eye out for Groupons they have them regularly!",

Celebrating my birthday with my husband and son on Dec. 19 was a special dining experience. I have no idea what they do to their Calamari Rings, but this was an appetizer extraordinaire. There was a special sauce that was extremely tasty, but the rings themselves were prepared in a way to make them very soft. I have eaten this appetizer at many different restaurants, but this is hands down the best. They kept bringing a basket of sliced bread with a orange-colored butter that was exquisite to the tongue. Then the main course of a chicken with fettucine was very well prepared. The healthy portion allowed me to take some home and much to my surprise heated up well two days later. The Server and Manager were very attentive also. I have no qualms about recommending Va Bene in Ahwatukee for a fine dining experience.",

We ate in the bar, which offers full dining service and a close-up view of the dance floor after 9. Drinks were reasonably priced with generous pours. We ordered the caprese as a starter and were happy with both the size of the portion and the freshness of the tomatoes and mozzarella. We used some of the complimentary bread to finish off the balsamic vinegar and olive oil that remained on the plate. For dinner, my partner had the chicken marsala which was cooked perfectly and accompanied by a small serving of mashed potatoes. I had the salmon, also cooked to perfection, served on a bed of roasted potatoes and green beans. Too often, restaurant chefs kill the vegetables and serve what amounts to limp mushy stuff but that was not the case here. The beans were al dente and flavorful and the potatoes were crispy without being overcooked. Our great meal was topped off by good music from the evening's cover band, Uncorked, making for a very pleasant Saturday date night!",

We have never a special that we didn't like- but the ravioli special is always our favorite.  I must say they have the BEST escargot I have ever had. It is in a delightful pastry and goes so well with a red Tuscan wine.  If you have any questions about wine, all of the servers are excellent at recommendations.

I dined divinely, I felt like a queen being served ALL delicious foods, the ambience of the atmosphere was absolutely delightful as my head bobbed to the soothing, smooth jazz, soooo relaxing. I was in a wonderful zone accompanied by me, myself, and I.  I just had a Grand old time.  I started out with an ice tea, tasting the tea leaves distinctively, which was really good, great soup and salad, I had the works! um good! yum, yum, yummy, blackened shrimp in my warm spinach salad.  It was very good, the warmness of the salad was different and I liked it!   I requested no alcohol in any of my food and was obliged by the chief.  My entree veal parmigiana was made specifically for me without any alcohol and delicious.  I conclude that I was very impressed with my service, food, atmosphere and manager interaction.  I felt very welcomed and not at all awkward dining alone.  I would return in a heartbeat, I had an excellent experience at VaBene!",

I went for a celebratory dinner with my boyfriend after one year together and the atmosphere in the dining room was just lovely. Very romantic.  Now on to my favorite part: the food. My guy had the Penne Sicilian, which was good, but not really something to rave about. I had the Gnocchi alla Vodka, a, and I quote, \"homemade potato gnocchi in a pink vodka sauce with shallots, fresh tomatoes and a touch of cream\". Absolutely heavenly. I scraped all the sauce off my plate just to be able to taste how wonderful it was until the very end. The homemade gnocchi was exactly the right texture and the whole dish just worked together so wonderfully. You need to try this. You deserve to try this! I dream about dishes like this one, seriously.  The dessert was also fantastic. We split a raspberry tartufo (we were so stuffed from the huge portions of pasta) and it was a great finish to the dinner. The final bill wasn't ridiculous, especially for the quality of the food (on my end, at least) and the atmosphere. I thought it was very reasonable and will definitely be looking forward to my next visit there soon.",

I have been to Va Bene a few times for different occasions and I continue to return for the Calamari alone! The absolute best Calamari I have found, and trust me I try the Calamari every where!   Their food is good, I have also ordered the Fruiti Del Mar, which was a really great dish. My friend a year later still talks about the best steak he has ever had.   I think Va Bene knows what they are doing and should continue to make its customers happy if they stick to their recipe for a great restaurant!",

The vodka sauce is spectacular! The gnocchi are like little clouds of deliciousness...well most of them.  The only glitch, and it is tiny but we are talking the best gnocchi in the country here, so if we find a nit we must pick it. They needed to be stirred and cooked for a few more seconds as some were not fully cooked.  The under cooked were a little bit \"doughy\".  All in all the are great, go there and eat them!",

When the hostess greeted us, we communicated that we had a reservation. She told us to have a seat anywhere. We walked in and found an open table but was dirty. We asked one of the servers if they could clean our table, she said sure and walked away. It took an additional 10 min to get drinks ordered. We ordered an appetizer that we never received. The food runner took our food and didn't know what the food plate was called, dumped it in our table and walked away. We asked our server for bread, never got it. Food on the other hand was absolutely delicious. Food is the reason I'm giving this place 2 stars. Ohh and did I forget to mention, no apology for the lack of service. The life music on weekends is nice and their prices are fair. If you don't mind the crappy service and getting ignored all night, this is your place.",

    "text": "I honestly don't know why this place has such high ratings. First off, upon walking in and letting the seating hostess know we would like to sit in the dining area, as the lounge was BLASTING with music, mind you, I LOVE MUSIC, but it sounded like a full blown stadium concert, I asked where the bathroom was, she pointed and said very edgy, \"Last door.\" I figured that she was trying to be straightforward because of how loud it was. I found my boyfriend in the lounge and he said he was glad I had gone to the bathroom because when he walked in the manager or supervisor was yelling at his employees, dropping \"f\" bombs and didn't even have the decency to at least close the curtain. While he is telling me this, I hear more yelling, we try to ignore it and enjoy our night. We got our food and OMG!!! Can you say SALTY!?! And that doesn't go just for their food but a bit towards our waiter, as well. With food that salty, at least make sure I have water so I can wash it down, and don't look at me like I'm a bother when I politely ask for more water and am the only one in the dining area. My boyfriend is also one of those, when we go out, he wants an appetizer, main course and dessert but before he could even ask about dessert, the waiter came with our check, dropped it on the table and left, at least he cleared our plates as he walked away. Overall, the only good thing was their warm bread that came with tomato basil butter and the guy who wasn't even our server but was there to help out. We will not be returning.",

I think and hope she will be recognized as well as the food and experience is a wining 1-- 2 punch..I always pay cash for my entire group and due to exceptional service last time left her a 70 tip because she was so sweet and attentive and a real people person...We will be back in june and i have been meaning to write this review on the restaraunt and this particular cocktail server for several months but am so busy in my medical practice that this has been my first opportunity i have had..Keep up the great work!!!!!!!",

My mom ordered the Pollo Marsala, which was AMAZING. We were all very impressed to say the least. I could go on about the dishes we ordered but there were 12 of us and that could take a while.

The atmosphere is relaxing, the food is outstanding and the prices are very reasonable.  What took this visit to the next level was the 5-star service we received from Todd.  He was truly exceptional in every way, and took very good care of us. I'd even go as far as requesting to be seated in his section next time (and there WILL be a next time!)",

    "text": "Place really is a gem. We went in on a Saturday evening about 6pm for dinner. I hopped on Groupon on the way there and purchased the $40 worth of food for $26 voucher. We sat in the lounge area which unless you have reservations on the weekend, you'll probably end up in. I actually prefer the lounge area over the dining room. Much more relaxed atmosphere. We got the bruschetta, chicken and mushroom fettuccine, and chicken picatta. All were delicious. Service was excellent. I was expecting to receive mediocre service since our waitress had about 4 to 5 tables who sat down at once in her section. Nope. She flew around making sure we all got taken care of in a timely manner and with a smile on her face. If she was stressed, we couldn't pick up on it. With two sodas, an app, and two meals the bill came to $46. Had to pay $6 for the difference, basically making the bill only $32 with the Groupon. It's hard to find good service , food and atmosphere for 2 people for under $50 with a tip. Va Bene seems to have mastered this. Not to mention, we have lunch for today with the leftovers from the large portions! Check this place out.",

PJ had one of the daily specials, orange roughy in asparagus sauce, and I had the rigatoni bolognese. The service was top notch and checked on us often throughout the evening making recommendations along the way.  As much as we like him, we could have done without the constant Frank Sinatra music. At least throw in a little Tony Bennett once in a while, guys. ;)  Overall relaxing atmosphere in the restaurant side. We didn't even know there was a bar until we took a detour to the restrooms on the way out and exited through the bar which, while quite noisy, couldn't be heard from the dining room.  The place is tucked away in a corner of a strip mall, not where I'd expect it to be at all considering the dining experience which was fancy without being intimidating AND without breaking the bank.",

The waitstaff was excellent, we didn't have to wave anyone down when our glasses started to look a little low, the bread basket was always full (and their tomato basil butter was delicious, too!)  It was a little pricey, but the food quality was certainly worth the price paid, imo.  I would certainly recommend Va Bene for anyone that would like an attainable, upscale Italian dinner or lunch.",

We didn't go to the lounge area so I can't say anything about that, we went straight to the dining area. The atmosphere was really pleasant and there were quite a few people on a Wednesday night which is always a good sign I think.   First, compliments and then critique.  The appetizer was good, we got shrimp in wrapped in bacon (as far as I remember) and it was yummy. The stuffed pork with cranberry wine sauce was delicious! Absolutely loved it. The portion was quite large too, I got stuffed. No pun intended. We also swapped the standard sides for their zucchini risotto which I thought was all right, not great, but my friend thought it was absolutely delicious.   Now the critique. This restaurant is not super expensive but it's not cheap. So you'd think that after you're done with your appetizer they would take your appetizer plate away. They didn't. It sat on the table with some shrimp tales pretty much through the entire dinner. And for $8 we only got 4 shrimp for the appetizer. I get it, that's what fancy restaurants do but could you bump it up to 6 maybe? Still not a lot, but they won't look so lonely on the plate.    Other than that, we had a really nice night out and will come back. It's hard to find a nice Italian restaurant that's not Olive Garden or (yuk) Rigatoni's quality so it was a pleasant surprise.",

    "text": "Came in earlier today for dinner. I had saved up an appetite for this place. I was definitely feeling like eating something meaty and filling. I decided upon the Lamb Shanks. Although coming to an Italian restaurant one would expect to eat something Italian. However, when I  saw this menu item I was sold. The dish came with two 8 oz lamb shanks and creamy feta risotto. The lamb shanks were fall off the bone tender and the risotto was really tasty and had a great consistency. You definitely get your moneys worth on this dish. (Two lamb shanks for $25 !) The only thing missing in this dish would have been some lemon wedges to squeeze over the dish as this was a heavy siting entree and would have helped to cut through the richness.   For dessert, I ordered the traditional creme brulee. the creme brulee had to be at least 8 oz of custardy goodness. it had a nice crust with even caramelization. the interior was still very chill and velvety. Definitely the one of the best creme brulees in the phx area. Also- one creme brulee is enough for two!",

We first had calamari which was far from good. All I could taste is oil and mayo. For a genuine Italian restaurant,  it was terrible. I had the seafood main dish which had scallops, shrimp, mussels, etc. I would rate it a 6/10, the pasta itself was way overcooked. The server Denny, only checked on us ONCE the entire hour and a half we were there,  so customer service was also terrible.  On the flip side,  the salad that came with the calamari was very good. Finally we had tirsmisu for desert and that was also very good. Rated it a one due to mediocre food and terrible customer service. Maybe it's because I was spoiled with amazing Italian food when I lived in Chicago.....",

The wait staff and food was delicious. We could have not have asked for better service or food for our reception. People complemented the service and food - for that I would have given 5 stars...  However, I took a couple of stars off due to the manager Donna and lack of communication. We originally started talking back in November over email as we live in NYC. It was easy enough to book and she provided us with a simple menu which we were pleased with. I emailed her to ask to meet with her in February as I was flying out to finalize things before the April wedding. She agreed (we did have to change the date since my flight was cancelled and rescheduled, but she agreed to meet me at the same time the following day). When I arrived Donna was not there - they had no idea that I was coming or when Donna would be in. We waited for a half an hour before Sasha helped us - I was ready to change the venue. Sasha was helpful and nice and offered a food tasting during the week. We came back for the food tasting and Donna met us - although she acted as though she couldn't be bothered with us. Michele, another manager from my understanding, took care of us.  Without Sasha or Michele I would have changed the venue.   Donna was also very hard after that to get in contact with. She took up to a week to respond to us, and the only time we really got any information was when Michele took over the emailing while Donna was on vacation. Additionally, Donna forgot to inform Michele that my husband would be by the day of the wedding to drop things off - we agreed at 3:30 so the room would be ready. When he arrived nothing was set up...  In the end, the food, wait staff, Michele and Sasha were wonderful. I would eat there again, however, I would shy away from arranging another big event.",

When we asked for him to come see us they sent someone else and they made an excuse how a big party ordered before us. Well, that is understandable but it was not understandable that other people that ordered the same thing got it before us. Pasta does not take 1.5 hours to make. Also, once we finally found our waiter he smelt of strong cigarette smoke and it was obvious that he was outside smoking the whole time we were not being helped. I do want to mention the guys that fill the water and bring the bread were nice! They should be the waiters you guys have and fire your current waiters! We won't be back.",

I was not impressed with the chicken piccata, which is my test for most Italian restaurants. It's a simple dish, and if they make that well, then usually the rest of their food is decent.  Their Piccata was very salty, and didn't have much of a lemon tang as it should. The dinner didn't come with a salad, or a vegetable even. I left the restaurant hungry, which for a $16 dollar meal shouldn't happen. My wife just had soup and a salad, because she was saving room for their expresso creme brulee. She liked what she had, but said she wouldn't order any of them again. That says enough for me that we'll likely not be going back any time soon.",

There are very few places around town that a person who is not in their 20's anymore can get their groove on. This is it!   Va Bene is an upscale (read: no base ball hats) wine bar that has a full bar, a dance floor and a stage! The decor is very classy with deep red long velvet drapes. Seating is around the HUGE bar, tall tables that seat 4 with white tablecloths and intimate booths (yes, IN THE BAR!)  They have great outdoor patio space on 2 sides of the restaurant with heat lamps in the winter and a nice counter height fire pit.  Va Bene hosts the best bands around like The Soul Solution (these girls can SING!!) and the sax player Todd is amazing!) and Contra Band. The bartenders and wait staff are friendly and make really great drinks. Try the Chocolatini!  The crowd is a high energy, great mix of everyone and it can get quite crowded between 9 and 11pm. You will see anything from sequins to nice jeans to suits.  FYI  The 2 corner bar seats on the left are reserved for my friend Kiki and I when the Soul Solution is playing. If you sit there you will be glared at by everyone. Lol!",

To my surprise it seems I should have paid more attention to the negative ones. Again I come from new Haven , CT where some of the best Italian food is and I can assure you I know fresh good Italian food and this was not it. Calamari should be light flour seasoned batter and what I was served was an onion ring type batter which was a bit oil saturated drenched in a type of mayonnaise. I also had  gnocchi alla vodka where there gnocchi was under cooked and sauce was just OK  a bit bitter. But I will say the most disgraceful thing was the seafood bisque it was no more than tomato soup with a single shrimp in the center . Seafood bisque should be creamy rich and vibrant also should have traces of seafood lol. !!!",

That's it no sorry or can we get you something for your next visit nothing. Wow well no wonder your not very busy when you have service like that and you close early because you don't feel like staying open. Way to run a business I tell ya.

    "text": "So, I left a review for this place December of 2016.    I am back to send myself (and any readers) a reminder why I love this hidden 24-year old Italian restaurant and bar.  Great each time.  I went on Tuesday January 9th with 3 buddies.  Good Call guys.  I have a hard time ordering since everything is delicious, and I want to everything on the menu.  Everyone ordered but me.  My friends have their go-to dishes already.  Sensing my frustration, the bartender Brett suggested I enjoy my known favorite: Chicken Piccata.  Served on small bed of craft mashed potatoes, I said maybe next time.  But the Picatta sauce:   butter, lemon juice, capers, with white wine was still calling my name.  The owner/manager Sasha was professionally eavesdropping and suggested I substitute salmon instead of chicken and place on bed of linguini instead of mashed potato. Hello. Wow, not on the menu, this was a home run! This should be on the menu all the time.  The salmon was flaky, perfect temp, and the linguini was the perfect texture.    Only 1 problem ...there was sauce left-over in dish so I asked for a little more of their in-house fresh bread to soak up the butter, lemon, capers, white wine delight!  Problem is the bread is so good, you need to avoid eating it before, and in my case, after your meal.  It is that good.  Va Bene is truly va bene!  PS:  White Sauce or Red Sauce Mussels appetizer is an amazing happy hour item.  PSS:  Don't fill up on bread, though you can't help yourself.",

There were some nice individual flavors, with the chicken and artichoke in a dijon sauce being quite tasty, but no dish we ordered really came together well.  Also, the service, while friendly and gracious (they comped us a glass of wine to make up for its slow delivery), went through a rough patch during our visit. Our water glasses were not refilled, dirty plates remained on the table for 20 minutes after our meal was finished, and the waitress brainfarted our creme brulee order out of existence.  Which is ok - we didn't need dessert, but we did kinda want it :).",

This is an nice little spot hidden just off the main roads but quite possibly overlooked.   The atmosphere is clean and inviting with a nice dimly lit environment that prepares you for a relaxing meal.   We found this place in Groupon where there was a $40 gift certificate for only $20 which makes trying a place out motivational!  We arrived and were promptly seated in the back room in the corner. I came to the conclusion that the staff doesn't notice you often in the corner....  Water is refilled at half cup by the roaming water fillers...   The food was a solid enjoyable 4 of 5 stars... it was tasty and good, but not an explosion of greatness... definitely worth the price and the visit.   Ordering desert requires more than 10 minutes of watching the waiter visit each table but ours as I waved and attempted to gain his attention.... finally he came ask we asked for the dessert menu but here is no actual menu so he verbally gave it to us... We ordered two desserts and coffee to end the night.  Getting coffee wasn't easy... the desserts came out and still no coffee. After a bit the waiter said he was making some coffee for us and then it arrived. Then we had to wait for real sugar since they brought a tray of chemical sugar substitutes that we wouldn't use...  Finally the coffee arrived and we drank it... nobody brought us refills of the coffee so we paid and left....",

I liked the ambiance very much but felt the food did not live up to the upscale atmosphere.  We would have been happier at any number of chain Italian restaurants that do not make their food from scratch.  I had the cream of mushroom soup that tasted like Campbell's, fortunalty... I like Campbells.  I asked the waiter if the pasta was made fresh... NO.  So I ordered the one item that is made fresh... the gnocchi.  It was very mushy like paste and the sauce tasted like it came from a can.  We also tried the pesto pasta which was meh.  We did not finish any of our pasta courses.  We skipped the main course and went straight to the dessert.  Once again, I ordered the only thing made fresh in house which was the cream brulee.  It was from the fridge... cold in the center and also meh.  The other dessert we tried was the chocolate cheese cake, not made on the premises, which was good.",

Despite the price being high hit is so worth eating there for New Years 3 course dinner. Also the regular menu is the best. The only criticism I would leave is when they have loud music in the bar area it is disturbing to the quiet atmosphere in the lovely restaurant.",

The stuffed pork chop was a tad on the salty and dry side, no horrible but not top notch. Salmon was well presented and very good. Prices are good so definately well worth the meal, overall a good experience worth a return visit.",

No cocktails. We had to flag down a hostess to check on our food. This is a fail. The dining room was really loud and there were little kids walking unsupervised all over the dining room (really not the restaurant's fault). My wife says the bar area is more fun to eat and no louder than the dining room, so maybe try that. But as a place for a large group or special occasion, this place was a big disappointment.",

The salad was small and the dressing tasted almost like mayo. I had my wife take a bite to make sure I wasn't wrong in my assessment.   When the server asked how the salad was, I honestly told her the salad wasn't good. The look on her face was priceless. I sucked it up and ate my salad. I hate to see $9 go down the drain.  My meal was better. I had the Rigatoni, sausage, peppers in a cream sauce.  I liked the dish quite a bit, but I was still a little scorned from the salad fiasco.   Entree 4 stars Salad 0  stars  The service was decent. The inside was nice and had a nice atmosphere. I can see why people like this place.  To me, this place is more flash.  I don't plan to head back to this place. If you do go, I'd avoid the salad. I think other Italian places in the area give you better food at the same/cheaper rate and overall provide better value for your dollar.  Just my 2 cents.",

We arrived at 7:30 for dinner, but the music here does not start until 9:00. That's on us - but just so you know, it starts at 9:00, a bit too late for dinner. The servers spent more time chatting at the bar than serving their tables. We ordered the lamb and it was very fatty. We were scrapping fat off the top to get to the meat. I rarely turn food down, but I couldn't eat this dish.  We decided to order dessert to pass the time and wait for the music to start. The cheesecake was not fresh or made in house. We decided to go back to yelp and see if we could find another wine bar near by  to save our night. Check out My Wine Cellar for better food, service, pricing and music.",

Are you kidding me?  Where do I sign up?  I saw the sign on the patio as we were walking thru the door and I knew it was going to be a good night!    I don't typically order calamari because everyone seems to have a version of it and it's usually not very good.  The calamari at Va Bene is thebombdotcom.  Seriously the best squid I have ever had.  For dinner I had the Risotto Mare Monte--light brandy cream sauce, shrimp, scallops, and wild mushrooms.  Very good.  The atmosphere was dark and romantic.  No one wants to have a spotlight on them with they're shoveling Italian food into their face.  It was perfect.  It was a quiet Tuesday night with only a couple other tables.  Besides, we were getting plenty of attention from the staff and other customers.  Four hot ladies do not need a spotlight.  :)",

We checked it out and we're impressed with the atmosphere, the service, the food, and the prices. Happy hour deals are great (ex: half-off appetizers and $1 off wine) and the food was terrific. We sat in the bar area and shared the beer-battered calamari (which was delicious!) and enjoyed the fettuccine with cream sauce pasta dish for our main course. The service was also fine--nothing too great, but kept our drinks full. Overall, a nice evening. We would definitely try it again when we're in that area.",

I had the linguine Putenesca which had tons of capers and olives, fresh tomatoes and a light tomato sauce. Heavenly if you love capers ant olives like I do. My husband had an Alfredo type pasta which completely bores me but he liked it. Tiramisu is not my \"to die for\" dessert so we shared one and it was very well done; rich flavors but not overly sweet. We will definitely return.",

The presentation was excellent and the wine was kept at about the right temperature.    For appetizers, we ordered the Escargot and the Scallops.  I must say, the escargot came out completely different than what I had expected.  It came out in a soft, flaky pastry, and could be separated out in 4 pieces.  It was extremeley done to perfection!  The scallops were also excellent, and the presentation was superb.  I opted for the Linguine Vongole (pasta and clams in a white wine sauce).  I've had this dish at several other places, and I must say this was the best one I've had so far.    The only 'downer' of the whole night was that our table was placed near the band, and it was a little distracting trying to talk over them.  Kind of hard for 10 people to have casual conversations to Journey.  :)  All in all, it was a very pleasant experience.",

    "text": "No thanks not going here again... Me and my girlfriend used to love coming here that is until last night totally ruined that for us. My dad was visiting from out of town and we were telling him we had to take him here so we get there at around 9:15 their hours says 10 o'clock they close ok so working in the business myself I think 45 minutes is a reasonable time that your not being a dick and coming in right before their about to close. So the pros food is always good. The owner who actually took care of us for most of our time there was very nice and helpful as well as a server there Daniel is very good and friendly. We are there for about 5 minutes just got our drinks when the bartender comes over and says \"do you guys know what you want the kitchens waiting on you I think they're trying to get out of here\" ........ I consider us very easy going customers but I have never felt so uncomfortable out to eat in my life.. Even if that's the case don't EVER say that to a paying customer that's just a huge no no. And as I said it wasn't like we came in right before they were closing they were open for another 45 minutes!! My dad even said something about it to us and he's been in the business his whole life and is as easy going as it kids. It was just a very uncomfortable feeling and it made the dinner very awkward the rest of the time we felt rushed and tried to eat as fast as possible as we felt like a burden being there. Also when the food runner brought out the dishes my girlfriend asked if she could have some pepper on her pasta dish. Very reasonable request very common the food runner was nice about it and obliged he comes back to the table with red crushed pepper she had wanted the ground black pepper. Easy mistake obviously so problem but the food runners reaction was just the icing on the cake to the whole meal he gave her this disgusted look and rolled his eyes I couldn't believe it. I thought at first I was the only one who saw it but then when he walked away my girlfriend said something about it too. We were very disappointed like I said food is always great here and reasonably priced and any service we've had hear from Daniel and another couple people that work in the bar area it has always been great but this time was enough to make us never go back. The lack of professionalism was amazing to me especially at a place of that caliber. Very sad because we enjoy the food maybe we will get takeout but probably won't be back. Oh and I had the stuffed pork on the menu 18.95 when we get the bill 22.95??? I could care less about the money I still would've got it if it said 22.95 on the menu but that's definitely illegal charging different prices then what's on the menu.. Very odd and disappointing",

And there was no apologies for the amount of time we waited to order a drink. And waiting for our waiter to take our payment. We literally had to walk to the hostesses desk. They wouldn't take our payment and told us to wait for our waiter. Waiter had a big party but made our table of 2 feel like an inconvenience or not a priority. So .... a lot of waiting. Disappointed.",

For dessert we ordered creme brulee and tiramisu.  Since it was my birthday I was given the tiramisu complimentary with a candle in it. (Very nice). We were told that the desserts were homemade . They were fantastic .   Service : Excellent!  Ambience : We had dinner in the dining room but the also have a lounge. I loved the artwork and decor throughout the restaurant .  Our reservations were at 8 pm and as we were leaving we could hear the live band starting to play in the lounge. If I hadn't worked a long hard day we would have moved into the lounge for a cocktail and entertainment. Looks like a lot of locals enjoy Friday nights at the lounge.    I will definitely return to Ve bene in the near future.  If you want delicious well prepared food, excellent service and great ambience then Ve Bene is the place.",

    "text": "I took a client out to eat at Va Bene's, one of my favorite local restaurants. After waiting a half hour for a salad, they completely screwed it up. My client nicely, but rightfully rejected it, and the asshole waiter literally patted my 60-year-old CEO client on her head (WTF!) and told her it was fine even though it was loaded with the very foods she had specifically requested be left off. Not cool!  He didn't like my request to take it back and sabatoged every aspect of the meal for the reminder of the night, from ignoring us, screwing up what were supposed to be free desserts, mischarging us, dumping off take-home boxes with no bag, serving the meal without silverware, and just generally providing horrendous service that was unbefitting for this establishment. This s*it show dragged on for 2 hrs with mistake after mistake and major attitude. I was deeply embarrassed and will never be back, let alone ever bring a client.",

The calamari was tender with a garlic mayonaise sauce.  Equally good. And portion size? They don't stint. At all.  Did I make you hungry? Good!!

The crowd is a 30+ crowd and I personally love that, since I am 30+.  :-)  I have been for HH and for the later hours for the band.  I think they have great HH offerings from the appetizer menu and for the drink menu.   The service here has ALWAYS been top flight and top class.  I've never been disappointed with the quality of service here.  My only complaint about this establishment is that it is in Ahwatukee and not in a more central location.",

Lets face it, sometimes its fun to be a $10,000 millionaire. We have been back many times, and every time are greeted by Sasha, the manager, and by our favorite waiters. Maybe this is because of the impression ( and 10 business cards) the hubski leaves everywhere he goes, or maybe everyone gets this treatment, but Va Bene is kind of like our Cheers now. The place has great decor and magnificent food, but you can eat for as little as $11 or as much as $35 per plate. The tiramisu is out of this world, as is the tartufo. What, you may ask, is a tartufo? Picture this and be prepared to salivate (maybe have a tissue on hand). A tartufo is a scoop of sorbet, chocolate or raspberry, dipped in chocolate (dark, I think), re-frozen, sliced on a bed of fresh whipped cream, and drizzled with chocolate or raspberry syrup. Unbelievable. I have ordered something different every time I go, and I never cease to be delighted. The first time was the most special though- the fish of the day. It was halibut on top of sauteed spinach and feta mashed potatoes. That's right. Feta. Indulgent. Nice bar, great wine list. We'll be back soon.",

Not sure on the prices of the drinks because i was being treated, but i would imagine they were on the heftier side, given the ambiance and style of the joint. all in all it was a better experience than i was anticipating - the crowd was certainly not my style but i didn't really feel out of place. i'll have to go back for eats and see if it's as fabulous and everyone says!",

The ambience is very nice and classy but do not be intimidated, for lunch everyone was casually dressed, jeans and even shorts.  Bread with awesome sun dried tomato basil butter is complimentary.  The appetizers looked phenomenal, with mostly seafood options, we couldn't decide what to order as a group so we unfortunately didn't try any =( I had the Penne con Brocolli, the garlic butter sauce was the best I've had, I mopped the rest of it off the plate with the fresh bread they kept refilling our baskets with. yummmmmmmmmmmm.",

Nice decor, dark and relaxing atmosphere. I ordered some bruchetta and ordered the rigatoni bolognese while watching some ESPN. The place looks pretty upscale.. Fast service, good food, nice digs. $24 for the appetizer, meal and 2 Heinees. Not bad. I'll be back next time I'm in town... Oh yeah, my boss asked me to look out for this beauty named 'Shannon' at the bar...no luck.",

The Service, too, has always been efficient, professional, and friendly.....until last Wednesday. We obviously caught them at a poor staffing time. My recommendation is NOT to arrive before 4:00 Happy Hour. The waitress took our drink orders but returned saying she was not the regular bartender and didn't know how to make the drinks. We waited (unattended) for a quarter hour when the regular bartender arrived and we placed our drink orders again with our food order. There was another delay in finding the Drambuie bottle. The bartender did not talk with the waitress so did not make our drinks as requested. She complained that we \"didn't specify\". I mentioned speaking with the waitress. Then, without another word, but with a frown, took my drink to remake it. The food (excellent as usual) arrived from the kitchen. The drink still was not correct but there was no way I was going to \"bother\" the bartender again. This was the only time we have ever had a less than excellent experience at VaBene. So, again, although they're open for lunch, don't go before 4:00.",

I visited on a Thursday night, no waiting, and few people there.  Very nice, comfy decor with red velvet drapes, dim lighting, white table-cloths, and picasso-like paintings all around.  Service was ok...the water-boy was good, but the waiter sporadically came by my table...always a bit late, and two waiters actually waited on me.  The menu had too much cream and pink sauce for me.   No whole wheat pastas.  One waiter actually helped me design my own meal which was nice.  I asked for a small side of arrabbiata  sauce expecting a hot red sauce, but made a cheesy, creamy mushroom sauce for me instead.  The complimentary bread was a bit stale and came with a cheesy stiff buttery kinda sauce...I had to ask for olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  They have a dining room and a separate lounge with a live jazzy band.  I think there's a private conference room too.",

    "text": "Staked at this place for a friend's dinner party for 25 or so. I was surprised to see one server for the entire group but somehow with some hiccups he managed to get it done. The server would grab everyone's attention and let us all know that we need to be in our seats so he can take he order. Is this grade school class?!?! Kinda ironic but I guess it works because otherwise his orders would get mixed up when receiving the checks in the end.   I read some of the horrific reviews from prior and major letdowns were the slowness in service but quickness in receiving drinks and salads and appetizers. While ordering if someone asked for a drink that previously didn't get one the server would halt the ordering procession and leave to go get the drink! Thought that was odd yet comical. And, surprisingly our food came out quick but it was only because it was almost 9pm after majority of the customers were done eating.   Gnocchi alla vodka: one of the best dishes on the menu or at least of what we tried. House made potato gnocchi with tomato, cream and pink vodka. $13.95  Zuppa di Vongole:  clams steamed in white wine, olive oil, garlic sauce. The sauce base was rather tasty. We were definitely missing the crostini (toasted bread) but did soak up the garlic sauce with the starter bread. $9.95  Fettuccine con pollo and fungi: normal run of the mill type of pasta dish that can be made at home. Chicken chunks and fungi pieces and creamy high caloric white sauce share amongst three. $13.95.   Getting our checks took years and not sure why. The server would start the same process as he did for taking food orders. So if you started last in food ordering you'd get your check last. Not sure what kind of system they have but definitely not efficient.",

Only complaint was they had a party of 12 seated in the same room as other couples trying o enjoy their significant other. It eventually got loud and disruptive. Almost very annoying. I actually don't know what management was thinking of putting a large party in a room of other couples. I had to skip dessert to get out of there because I couldn't hear anything my girlfriend was saying anymore. Next time, seat the bigger parties in a separate room.  I won't ding the restaurant for that because I thought my overall service was good. I just hope that doesn't happen again or else I'll have to edit this review.",

When we got there for dinner, we were told that due to the \"holiday\" they were not accepting Groupon vouchers.  What holiday?  Mother's Day is not a holiday!  And when I made the reservation, there was no mention of \"no Groupon's\".  Their website also said nothing about \"no Groupon's for this \"holiday\"\"!  Since we were already there and my wife wanted to eat something here she likes, we decided to stay anyway.    We got a grumpy and surly waiter who did not make my attitude any better.  We ordered drinks and those were fine and came quickly.  They took some things off the menu that we liked, so we ordered 4 large appetizers -- the bruschetta was fine (and this is what my wife wanted), and so was the antipasto platter.  But the both the calamari and the steamed mussels in tomato broth came to the table cold.  This added to my disappointment.    So I don't think I will be visiting this establishment again.",

    "text": "A 5-star rating, a rating that has lost its original weight. A 5-star rating used to mean something, now, it is lost in a sea, ranging from excellent to mediocrity. In the era of reviews being characterized by only 1's and 5's, the coveted 5-star review has simply lost its gusto. I say all of this only to assert that a 5-review for this restaurant is just not enough. Va Bene has been such a phenomenal experience that words simply cannot begin to describe how fantastic this restaurant is.   First, the food. All of us at our table would have gladly switched plates with one another, it was just that good. All of our dishes were perfectly prepared and tasted fantastic. Throw the thesaurus at the word \"great\" and you barely even scratch the surface on describing the quality of our meals. I couldn't even tell you what I ordered because it was recommended to me by our server, Borris. Which leads into the second half of the review, the service.  The service was unlike anything I have experienced. The whole staff was lovely and very attentive. I don't believe I ever saw my water glass even get to half full, they were on top of their game. Our server Borris was unbelievable. Our group had significant allergy restrictions and he went well above any other server we have ever encountered. Going as far as to build perfectly balanced dishes around some bizarre and difficult allergies to deal with. This man knows his food. He did such an amazing job curtailing a custom-made dish for one of our party members that I flat out told him to order me whatever he suggested. He clearly knows more than I do and there is not a single dish on the menu that would not be absolutely phenomenal. He was right and I thoroughly enjoyed my dish. This is the type of restaurant that can prepare food you didn't think you liked, but actually, it had just been prepared incorrectly all this time.    So, in conclusion, do I recommend Va Bene, absolutely! There should be a waiting line out the door and halfway around the block every night for this place. If you like Italian cuisine, or are just looking for an experience like no other, Va Bene is on the top of my list. Oh, and did I mention, the price is so reasonable it shatters any and all expectations? I cannot believe I walked out of the door with a plate of food and the best homemade tiramisu for only $23 before tip. Unreal.  P.S. The homemade creme brulee and tiramisu were utterly amazing. Save room for dessert, you will not regret it!",

The penne dish my guest ordered wasn't as enjoyable. My guest stated it didn't have much flavor. I gifted him with my risotto leftovers and got feedback that it was fantastic! They have an exceptional wine list, especially the reds. It was very convenient to make reservations via Yelp. Reservations were even confirmed! My disappointment, and reasoning for taking a star away, is because I didn't get the personal attention I requested when setting up the reservation. I went with my guest for celebratory reasons. The option shouldn't be there when making reservations if there will be no follow through. Other than that, the staff was amazing from point of entry until departure, and even made an accommodation for my guest at my request. However, I would have been happy to pay extra for my little surprise that I wanted to present to my guest had I been reached as I requested. The shrimp and mussels for starters are also great choices.",

    "text": "Found them on Groupon so decided to give them a try. Went there on a Monday evening. Hostess wasn't welcoming or friendly when we arrived and it was the same when we left. The restaurant was empty so I'm not sure what the issue was with that.   We were seated in the dining room which was nice and quiet. Our server was great. Friendly, upbeat, and knowledgeable about the food and wine menus. He made great meal suggestions and the service was fast. We ordered calamari to start and had the linguine vongole and the penne aglio olio peperoncino con broccoli.  The food was amazing and portion size was on point. We ate it ALL. I don't even know how we managed. It was so good, we just couldn't stop eating.    There were only two things I would've changed about our visit. First, when our main dishes were brought out, they left our empty appetizer plate on the table (this wasn't our server). It would have been nice if it were cleared off after putting down the main course or even prior. It ended up sitting on our table for a little bit. When our server came back to check on us, he saw it and quickly cleared it off. Next, would be the hostess. They are the first and last interaction guests experience with the restaurant. I would think a little training would help in both cases.   But overall, we enjoyed it and plan on returning again.",

    "text": "You've heard the expression, \"you only have one chance to make a good impression\", right?  Hmmmmm...hold that thought.  I saw Va Bene reviewed on PBS Arizona's, \"Check Please\". It's not at all convenient to where I live so I waited until I was \"near\" and decided to try it. (I was \"near\" all right: still took 25 minutes on I-10 to go from the 60 to Chandler Blvd).  I walked in and the place was hopping!  The bartender, alone, was crushed, waaaaaay too much bar for one person, yet she was friendly and efficient.  I asked The Guy In The Black Suit about appetizers and he assured me the right pick would be the mussels with marinara, Italian sausage, peppers and onions (\"Cozi Va Bene\"). It came out in good time, the marinara was amateurish.   Before I filled up on bread, I ordered the Chicken Marsala and 35 (!) minutes later, I complained, it got fired right away and delivered- and it was not acceptable.  Not cooked. Problem in the kitchen.   The Guy In The Black Suit comp'd my drinks and the uneaten entree but he couldn't comp the disappointment. Consider the gap between a TV exhibition so impressive that I made the effort to try a restaurant on a night bursting at the seams under the weight of too few staffed employees.   Though this restaurant was WAS out of my way, I've got no problem driving a distance  for a great meal. This experience was a complete and utter failure and, no, I won't be back. For any reason.  Enjoy the exposure from the PBS spot. Waste of my time.",

Unfortunately it was only average,  with a sparse dipping sauce sprinkled over it.  We've had better in many places.  I ordered a chicken piccata, she a stuffed pork loin which could have used more sauce.  Both the chicken and the pork were tough, but flavorful, with fresh veggies.  Service was average but slow.  The house wine was good and relatively inexpensive.  The best part of the evening was the discount through Groupon!  Our Creme Broule wasn't as good as we had hoped for.

He offered a parmesan chicken that was not on the menu with fetachini it was delicious  and the gnocchi was knock it out the park.

This is an authentic Italian spot with real Italian waiters and cooks. The smell of the restaurant made my stomach growl and mouth water. Remember to dress nicely when coming here, I felt under-dressed wearing khakis. A candle lit dinner was nice but my table was unstable and wobbly. The waiter was hardly checking up on us, it felt like he had better places to be. We ordered the chicken mushroom dish and it was spectacular. Also ordered creme brulee and it was very delicious but they burnt the sugar on top  too much so it became very bitter...

They automatically added the tip @ 20% of the total before applying the Groupon.  Now I tend to be a generous tipper, and will gladly pay for Good Service.  But, I DO NOT like being told what to tip, without being informed of this before hand.    I have used Groupon's before, and this was the first time I was confronted with this tipping procedure.",

    "text": "We went to Va Bene with a coupon from Living Social. I figured that we would have no trouble spending $60 on dinner for 2 on a Sunday evening. I was surprised to see that it was harder than I thought.   It was very slow on Sunday night around 7, and we were not greeted at the front door so we wandered into the bar. We were told we could seat ourselves in the bar, or have the hostess seat us in the restaurant. The bar was fine. The bartender took our drink orders and although my husband was disappointed that there are no beers on tap, he managed to find something he would enjoy - a Stella. No bad marks here, as not every bar needs to have beer on tap.   We skipped the appetizers, but they look worth checking out in the future. Especially since happy hour offers them at half price.   I had the chicken marsala - which is my favorite dish and it did not disappoint. There were 2 large half chicken breasts and a nice brown sauce loaded with mushrooms. It came with mashed potatoes and veggies, so the plate was generous. My husband had chicken in an artichoke cream sauce, and it was very good as well.   I only have one minor complaint:  My husband's plate was cleared before I was done eating. When there are only 2 diners at the table and I am the only one with a plate in front of me I feel rushed. I am sure that was not intended, and is probably just my pet peeve, and not a reason not to return to a place that had really good food in a beautiful setting.   When the server learned we had $60 to spend he said we should order something else as our bill was only $43. So we had both regular and chocolate cheesecakes and coffee (even after a 2nd beer, we were still under $60!). Some of the desserts are made in  house, and I should have gone with one of those. The cheesecake was fine, but did not stand out.   I certainly recommend Va Bene for a nice dinner that won't break the bank. Also, even though I checked the box that says it's an upscale restaurant, we were not the only ones seated at linen covered tables in shorts. Hey, it's still Phoenix.",

You get literally a giant mount and its pretty delicious. I also love the carpaccio.  Very simple but really good. I always find myself wanting to order another plate. the only thing that I didn't enjoy was the escargot. it came wrapped up in a puff pastry with a creamy sauce inside but the puff pastry was very underdone so it was basically still raw on the inside which made for an even chewier experience then the snail itself. but overall I like this place and would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to grab a few appetizers and brings.

Luckily for them the food saved them on this review. The main course was good and so was the tiramisu. The bread was good but they don't give you much. The kind they give you comes with a olive oil type butter that was interesting and pretty good.",

At first, I thought I might be too under dressed. it has a dining area with table cloths and candles.  I was in just shorts and a polo shirt and was not looking for a fancy place.  but they have a great little bar area with tables that worked out just fine.  I ordered the stuffed pork, wife ordered the spaghetti.  My daughter ordered some shrimp pasta and I did not get to see what her fiance ordered, but it must have been great, he ate it all! My pork was great, I really enjoyed the dish.  cooked just right, mashed potatoes were perfect, vegetables were super.  Wifes dish was very good.  I'd recommend this place if you're in town. great service, great food.  it's on the list to return to sometime.",

For happy hour you can expect to pay a little over $4 for just the calamari and they are very generous with portions. I love the crispy-ness and the calamari itself isn't chewy.   I loved our bartender, she was so sweet and helpful. The hostess on the other hand was awkward and rude. I am pretty sure she has no idea what her job entitles. We walked in and she gave us a rude stare as if we were suppose to be the first to speak. Excuse me, but a \"Hi, welcome to Va Bene\" would have been a thoughtful gesture as it is your job. We just didn't bother, we just helped ourselves to the bar.   Please Va Bene, inform your hostess to talk and let them know what their job duties are. They are not well informed or you just hire high school girls to stand around. We've had this experience here a few times.  The owner of the place was pleasant, sweet, and friendly. The staff who brought out our food was also very kind, this was very pleasing. Great establishment, great bartender, great food (pure excellence), great vibe, and amazing martinis.",

Yesterday ( mothers day), I phoned Va Bene ahead of time  to make sure they would accept groupon before I went online to buy it. The young lady on the phone said yes, so I purchased it. My wife and I are in our 60's and enjoy eating at the bar. When we tried to order clams the bartender said they were out of clams. It was around 5 pm. For a Italian restaurant not to have clams is like a ice cream parlor that doesn't offer ice cream but there were other food options we entertained. After spending $75 for 4 drinks & food we presented our groupon & credit card for payment only to have a lady by the name of Donna flat get in our face and told us she wasn't allowing us to use the groupon. No apologizes, just total rudeness. She was extremely indignant & unprofessional, enough for our bartender to be embarrassed. My wife & I felt very insulted by this person and from now on we will dine at the other restaurant that offers excellent service & always has clams. Last but not least, after buying the groupon I found an older one that we had't used that indicates \"never expires\". Donna indicated she would never honor that one as well.",

The bar is elegant and large with very comfortable bar stools. There are several TVs which are usually playing a sporting game of some sort. Our bartender, Tyler, was fantastic! They offer generously sized $6 martinis with well liquor. The price drops to $4.50 for happy hour, which is unbeatable!  Unfortunately, I wasn't terribly impressed with the food. It wasn't bad by any means but it was lacking. The pasta was quite overcooked, there was way too much cheese on the salads (thick slabs of bland mozzarella), the chicken piccata was somewhat bland, the sausage was extremely undercooked. So much so that we had it sent back to the kitchen. Tyler was very cool about it and gave us a cocktail on the house.   Although I'm a little disappointed with the food, I very much approve of the laid back bar scene and the extra friendly bartenders. With a little added passion in the kitchen, they will be well on their way to being one of the hottest spots in town.   Give it a shot, you may really enjoy it! It's got lots of potential.",

    "text": "This place is an Italian restaurant with decent food and and very good wine list with prices and ambiance leaning toward the upscale.  I had been here once with my sister for dinner shortly after they opened and found the prices to be higher than the quality of food and service warranted and so promptly forgot about it and never came back (and apparently never even wrote a review).  Flash forward to last Friday night when I am out with a bunch of ladies celebrating not one but two birthdays. We were in a party mood and so opted to sit in the bar area.  Boy, we did not know what we were in for.  Crazy loud music with a total meat market atmosphere. Unfortunately the band that night was a funk/r&b band which is not at all our style. After watching the cougars stalk their prey and the odd couples on the dance floor gyrate to Prince and Parliament songs for a couple hours, I was ready to get out of there. I think with a different band I may have enjoyed it a little more but I generally prefer a more laid back atmosphere and to be able to talk to my friends at the table without having to shout.  On the plus side, the food was very good.  My favorite Italian place in this part of town is Vincitorio's (on Elliott and McClintock) but I don't really care for their linguine with clams dish so I took advantage and ordered it here at Va Bene and it did not disappoint one bit.  I mean, it was so good I ate the whole thing and then mopped up the sauce with the rest of the bread in the basket.  Yum!  I also sampled some of my neighbors Gnocchi and that was fantastic as well.  Everyone at the table of 8 girls seemed to love their food and we all ordered different wines by the glass and no one was disappointed in that, either.  So, if you are in Ahwatukee looking for good Italian food and good wine and you don't mind spending a few extra bucks then this is a good option (Caffe Boa just up the road is a more affordable with same ambiance) but don't come on a Friday or Saturday night unless you are looking to party, hook-up, or shake your booty... or maybe all three!",

My wife's pasta was nothing to rave about, and our guests' food was about the same. What bugged me the most was the service. Inexistant. the \"server\" never smiled, never showed enjoyment, he ruined our experience. Like I said, feed me but serve me like you mean it. Mission failed at Va Bene.

    "text": "Tried Va bene after eyeballing it on Groupon for quite a while. A few days before dinner I called and made a reservation; upon arrival we had to wait. The restaurant is kind of a yin and yang situation; one side is a full loud bar with TVs blaring sports and the other half is the dining area. The tables in the dining room are pretty close and the atmosphere is very loud and chaotic, not relaxing and romantic as I'd hoped.  At first our server seemed really icy and rude but throughout the night he became much more personable. Food wait times were bordering the \"I'm getting very hangry\" point. While the portions were VERY generous, the food was just very average to me. Not bad, not great. I think that on a slower night things could be better; I just don't live close enough to make that gamble.",

Honestly I think the restaurant and the bar depend so much on the regulars, that don't expect much, they could care less if you get good service or food. They make their money and so what! I'm looking for a different Italian restaurant. Any suggestions?",

We had an appetizer of calamari which was cooked perfectly with nice thick pieces of calamari. The linguini had: mussels, clams, shrimp, calamari & scallops in a red sauce. The plate had so much seafood, I could only eat half of it. Of course I had to get the creamy cheesecake with raspberry sauce. Unbelievable!!",

    "text": "When I see escargot on a menu, I never pass it up!!!  Escargot Sauteed with garlic and a creamy gorgonzola cheese baked in a puff pastry with a spicy mustard sauce....YUM!  Wow. Enjoyed it so much. There also was a drizzle of a sweet strawberryish sauce in the sides of the plate. Oh so nice. A gentle blend of flavors that simply melted in my mouth!  Puff pastry was a tad undercooked, but only a tad. It was too good...I want to go back and have more.   I was debating on veal Marsala or the stuffed pork chop with prosciutto. The waiter suggest a non-menu item: veal parmigiana. So I went with that. Never had it like this. I did wish I ordered the Marsala. That being said it was very good. Tomato sauce was so fresh. I did like the leaves of fresh basil I could mix in with the meal. Made a huge difference. The thinly prepared veal was sitting on a bed of spaghetti flat noodles.  A nice portion. The veal...each bite, every single one, tasted tender and had a mellow flavor. (I do. It think they were breaded). What I am trying to say is that each bite tasted identical. Yes!  Each bite was equally tender. Each piece of meat was wonderfully prepared before cooking.     Service was friendly and service was done in a timely manner. I had forgotten what cheese was in the escargot, before it arrived and asked the waiter. He did not know. That surprised me a bit.     Someone did order the stuffed pork chop. Came sliced resting in a clear mushroom sauce. He said it was a little dry but tasty and the sauce was not as flavorful as he would have liked. Overall...he liked it!",

    "text": "We have gone to Va bene for work lunch and it has always been ok. Decided this time to go for dinner so I took my Girlfriend.  Right away, the service was great. We were seated fast and brought menus. We were told about the specials of the day and we ordered appetizers quickly.  I order the Linguine Fruitti Del mar, and my girlfriend had the pesto linguine. We ordered the clams as an appetizer.  The clams came out and were great. The garlic broth smothering the clams were super tasty and the bread was crispy and great for dunking. The portion is really small, I counted 6 clams and 2 of them were empty. I swished my fork in the broth to see if they fell out, but they were never there.  The main course was pretty bad. The pesto had virtually no Basil taste and if you closed your eyes, you would not have guesses any basil was used. We tried it with our eyes closed and it tasted almost fettuccine -like. My Del Mar was super bland as well. It tasted like canned tomato paste. The Mussels were tough and chewy and not enjoyable. The calamari looked like noodles and had no taste. They were mushy and seemed to be over soaked or over-boiled. The crushed Red Pepper helped to spice up the dish, but didn't really help mask the overall blandness.  I gave this 3 stars cause the service was prompt and the owner (I think) came out a few times to check up on us. The bill was appropriate for a two person dinner (roughly $50). The food was the only disappointment. I will give this place another try and hope that our next visit is more tasty.",

From the moment you walk in the front door you feel welcome.   Last month we were on the patio saying our good byes to our friends when we were confronted by a rude lady (Dawn W apparently) as were we leaving. There was nothing polite about her approach, she informed us that her, her family and Pit Bull were bothered by smoke, we were leaving nothing needed to be said.   She is a busy body with nothing better to do then confront people with her problems by bringing her dog to a restaurant and wanting everyone to accomindate her. The restaurant is non-smoking and had she not brought her dog they could have been seated inside. There are several \"dog friendly\" patios, this is not one of them with a permit and would suggest she leave her dog at home or go through a drive through restaurants and go home. Thought I would share with her the Maricopa County DOG ordinance with Dawn W.   ***The following application should be completed and returned to this Department prior to operating a Dog Friendly Patio. Approval of a Dog Friendly Patio permit will be given upon completion of a Department conducted inspection for compliance with the requirements of the Maricopa County Environmental Health Code, Chapter. VIII,  2, Regulation 4 and U.S. FDA 2013 Food Code  6-501.115.***  She claimed they \"always bring their pit bull\" and sit on the patio. We have never seen her or her dog on the patio before.   In closing I hope Dawn W returns but leaves her pit bull at home so she and her children can sit indoors.   Chow",

There are so many Italian restaurants in the valley, I have to admit, I probably wouldn't have found Va Bene if it weren't for a causal search on Groupon one day.  I thought...sure I'll buy it, what's the harm in trying.  I live in the west valley so not exactly close by...but we happened to be passing through last night so we stopped to try it out. We were early...around 5 or so.  The place was pretty empty and we were seated in the nice and quiet back room.  Our server (who I failed to remember his name but he was a friendly gentleman from Yugoslavia) was EXTREMELY nice and helpful.  He asked if we'd been before and we said no, so he was awesome in explaining dishes.  We had our children with us and they don't have a children's menu but they were more than willing to make something kid-friendly for them (although honestly my kids love everything and will eat most anything).  Our table ordered and highly enjoyed: Pasta Siciliana Pasta Bolognese Shrimp with Curry Sauce-a unique twist that my husband enjoyed per our server's recommendation  Alfredo (for the kiddies)  Gnocchi alla Vodka-this was my dish and it was OUTSTANDING-probably some of the best gnocchi I've ever had.  I would drive across the valley again just for this dish. I now know where to come when I am craving gnocchi...done right. The bread and tomato-Basil butter is delicious, warm and fresh.  The starter salads were also very good, nice size portion. We were stuffed but I had to try their 'one of a kind' espresso Creme Brulee.  It is very unique-sweet.  I highly recommend it. Service was fantastic....up until the end.  Took a little while to clear plates and bring the check but I won't fault them because by then it was 6:30 and they were getting busy. This is a family owned spot and we had a wonderful meal.  I am already drooling when I think about eating that gnocchi again!!",

The bartenders and staff are equally as friendly and so attentive. I recommend the pasta...it's all so delicious. When I've gone in I've noticed a lot of familiar faces so they get a lot of regulars and I think that speaks highly of the restaurant.",

Now for the food- we started off with the calamari and it was AWESOME....I asked if the had Cannelloni but I was out of luck fortunately the waiter suggested something else the chicken pasta with mushrooms (not the correct name but you should be able to find it on the menu) and it was great. The over all atmosphere was great and service was on point. I will definitely be going back.",

    "text": "Dined here tonight. We arrived around 4 and had a reservation (read some Yelp reviews that it's a must!). Though the dining area was empty when we arrived. After half an hour, a couple more tables started coming. Our waiter, who was pleasant I must say, greeted us and started telling us about their daily special - which I didn't fully grasp (too hungry to listen). We stuck with the regular menu and ordered the Caprese Salad, Prosciutto with Melon, Chicken Pesto Pizza and Chicken and Mushroom Pasta. Waiter said they are out of Prosciutto with Melon so I opted for Beef Carpaccio instead. Food was delivered after about 15 minutes of waiting. Beforehand, the waitstaff gave us complimentary  bread and butter to munch on. Our bread was a bit burnt.  Nevertheless the water was filtered and doesn't have that tap taste. Anyway, food arrived and everything tasted decent. Nothing really popped out, nothing was too exquisite for me to have the urge to go back soon. Since we have a bit of room for dessert, we opted to try their Tiramisu. We ended up wishing we hadn't. I expected that dessert would really be savory and delectable since it is from a restaurant, but I seriously had better ones from the frozen aisles in grocery stores. Meh, maybe it's just me. Then again, I wasn't the only one who didn't find it spectacular. Nevertheless, I think I'll be back. My experience wasn't horrible, it just wasn't spectacular.   All in all, ambiance is romantic and intimate. Food is so-so. Service is decent. Solid 3 stars!",

The food was salty, and I almost never find restaurant food too salty, I like my food pretty salty. The Cesar salad was OK but I couldn't eat the salty fried potatoes that came with my seared tuna but the server brought me some good mashed potatoes and I removed the tuna from the too salty sauce and ate it with bites of the mashed potato's. I'm a huge fan of green beans and I didn't bother to eat the tasteless  green beans that came with the tuna. The tuna didn't taste as good as it looked. Even the generously sized martini didn't taste good to me and I suspected it wasn't actually Kettle One. The olives were standard bottled ones not the tasty ones I have come to expect.  When I came in I was asked if I wanted to sit in the bar or dinning room and I asked which was quieter. They said the bar. The only small table available was wedged between to loud parties of 4 and then the rock and roll band started! They were good. They played only one song and tuned their guitars for awhile and I left immediately when I was finished. $55 poorer but wiser. Will not be returning.",

We also had nasty gum all over our candle light that was on our table. What type of adult does that? food was good not great, but if you read any of my reviews you know I am a food snob and expect great food. I will try it one  more time, but Gonna try the restaurant side next time looks really nice I would say more of a date thing.",

    "text": "I will still give it 4 stars.  The waitstaff was attentive, the food was delicious.  We had our puppy with us and asked if their patio was dog friendly before entering.  They were having a wedding reception on their regular patio but the manager was accommodating to place us on the front patio with our puppy.  We were by ourselves and we had at least 4 employees checking in on us regularly.  Very friendly and personable, it was the best Italian food I have had in a long time and excellent service.  The only issue we had was with some \"regular\" customers who were smoking very close to the entrance and the smoke was strong.  We didn't say anything until we were being served our dinner and I politely asked if they'd please put out their cigarettes or move away from the entrance area as I had 2 children with me and we were about to eat... then chaos.  Older and set in their ways these regular customers were externally rude and started yelling at me.    They pointed out that management lets them smoke there and even puts out ashtrays for them.  When the manager stepped in he was understanding but also claimed he was following laws and once again I was told that the people I approached were regulars.    He was obviously apologetic and spent a great deal of time with us after the altercation, being very friendly and attentive.  When others were smoking on the sidewalk a bit away from the entrance but near where we were I saw that he got nervous again and perhaps worried I would say something else.  It wasn't on the same patio and they were a good 20 feet away on the sidewalk in an open area so it didn't affect us at all.  I didn't mind as it wasn't right there under the same patio, and the smell wasn't so intense it would effect the quality of our meal.   I appreciated the hospitality and the food was amazing.  I would like to return but not if I have to smell smoke while I dine on the patio and I don't want to deal with angry regulars who feel they own the place.    I have attached a picture of the Smoke Free Arizona Act.  I don't mind a good cigarette after a hearty meal and a few glasses of wine either, but I don't do it under a patio where it bothers other diners who are trying to enjoy their meal.  I would like to see this establishment direct it's smokers away from the entrance, out onto the open air sidewalk just outside of the patio and away from people who are trying to also enjoy their dinning experience.",

It was really helpful when the chef came out to explain everything on the board. We enjoyed making our own creations. Every thing was very tasty.   We are still talking today how much we enjoyed our night there. We have definitely found a new dinner favorite!",

I tried a different entree recently that was just as tasty as my favorite!  I took a friend visiting from NYC and he was definitely impressed.

I wish they offered more options as there isn't a \"build your own.\"  Regardless it's the New York, fold over, and pack it in type. Great flavors and a sauce that's authentic.

The waiter asked if we were interested in hearing about the specials. I decided to order the filet mignon special. The wait for our food was a long one. They did keep our drinks full, and the bread basket and butter held us over. The filet was melt in your mouth. Absolutely delicious! It was not over cooked, rather, it had just the right amount of pink. The sauce was divine. The green beans were very fresh and quite delicious as well. The mashed potatoes weren't great, nothing to brag about. After our meal. The waiter asked if we would be having dessert. Uh, duh! I was torn between the Creme brulee and cheesecake. I decided to go for the Creme brulee. It was definitely over carmelized and had to scoot most of the over charred to the side. Overall, a wonderful dining experience. Intimate ambience and wonderful service.",

However, I was completely wrong. Our server was HORRIBLE. He never checked on us, was rude, and the food came extremely late. We were there for hours just waiting on him. I remember we asked him for bread which is normally brought out for an appetizer and he literally told us, \"We didn't need bread.\" Uhhh, excuse me? I told him literally 3 times to bring the bread and after several attempts and getting tired of waiting, the bread finally came out. Everyone at my table was restless. I complained for the horrible service I received and there was no redemption. The manager did nothing and looked at me as if it had been a joke. This experience totally ruined my birthday and I was extremely embarrassed to have brought my party.",

Upon arrival to Va Bene, we were greeted by a lovely hostess who was more than helpful confirming our reservation and seating us.  A shorter italian man filled our waters immediately and blessed us with the most amazing bread and butter.  Kudos to this guy, his service was the most superior.  Then we met our waiter, he didn't seem to have a ton of knowledge of the menu, specials, or wine.  I asked for a sweet white (moscato) and it took him a minute to process, nevertheless, we continued forward.  We ordered calamari for the table, and it was pretty tasty.  I had the gnocci alla vodka and my partner had the shrimp alfredo.  My dish was less than satisfying, too much tomato and not enough parmesan.  After it was all said and done, we had plates stacked on the table so I didn't feel right ordering desert because I didn't feel like holding the plate.  Work on your service and it'll make up for the food :)",

Food was fabulous..try the veal dishes (Marsala and Picatta) and the Mushroom Soup (Zuppa di Fungi) peppery and just the right amount of spice.  Reminds us of dining in Providence , RI.  Service was great, Boris, our waiter was most attentive and helpful in making our menu choices.  Nice romantic atmosphere, white table cloths, the works.  Now why I rated with 4 stars and not 5 to no fault of the restaurant or staff.    The table next to us was a different story and almost ruined a nice romantic dinner.  The couple get seated, a middle-aged couple, (he was wearing a ball cap and once removed the was balding) guessing both in their early 50's. Then they both start on their mobile phones..ugh. Not once did they stop..searching the web, making calls, receiving calls, etc. HOW DAMN RUDE. Plus it was obvious they had a GroupOn for $40 and tried to stay in that limit and order food to go. When the food came he (Mr. Bald Cap) bitched at his wife for ordering the food. Well if he was off his phone long enough he could have figured out what she ordered. GEEZ. The meal continued both on their phones. So I requested the bill and even commented to the Boris the waiter how rude they were and he said that was normal behavior today...NOT ACCEPTABLE PEOPLE. I thought this ugly, rude behavior was limited to our Millenials (our children) BUT NO it is now so prevalent in our older society it is out of control.  Bottom line of the review...do to Va Bene and enjoy a nice meal with great service and tell the people next to you to turn off their DAMN phones for an hour.",

The food was excellent, as I said above, my wife had the vela piccata and I ordered the linguini vignole.  Each was well prepared and the pasta with each was al dente.  The wine selection is extensive and offered a good variety.  Overall, we had a great time.",

They are generous and the HH liquor is a descent selection. Also, trust their bartenders. Give them an idea of what you like and let them create. Aldo made us a guava one that was great.  Eat: Grilled Veggie Appetizer. I am not sure what they do that makes this so good but we get it almost every time. Calamari. Good. Both at half price for HH. We ordered the gnocchi to split and it was great. No ridiculous split plate change either.   We will be back again.   Regarding the Groupon. It is a good deal if you miss Happy Hour or sit in the dining room. We went for HH and the Groupon doesn't apply.",

    "text": "We called ahead to ensure they were serving linguini with white clam sauce, mainly because my stepfather was craving it for about a month and a half.  We were assured they were.  I convinced my parents to come to Ahwatukee to dine at Va Bene instead of going to the West Valley because, well, you know I don't go West of 7th Avenue except in extreme circumstances.    We arrived and found Va Bene's dining room to be extremely dark.  I am all for ambience, but when I am eating I like to have a little bit more light so I can appreciate the plating of the dish.    We were seated in the dining room to the right of the host stand, which was nearly empty at 5:30 on a Saturday, but started to get a few tables by 6ish.  We ordered several appetizers, chianti and sangria for the table and five entrees, including two orders of linguini with white clam sauce.  As our appetizers were delivered, we were informed that the chef did not think the clams were any good.  If we were told this when placing the order (or when the order was put in), we would have chosen to go to another restaurant.  At this point, we were stuck having to order something else.  There was another seafood dish offered as a replacement, but it was a few dollars more per dish.  We went ahead and ordered it since we had no other real choice, but to stay.  Of course, we were glad to not be served bad clams!  The appetizers were hit or miss.   The calamari was EXTREMELY chewy.  My daughter could not bite through them at all.  I had difficulty chewing through the rings and chose the tentacles instead.  The Melanzane Ripiene was delicious, but it was a very small portion.  I don't eat Carpaccio, but my mom said it was pretty good.  The bruschetta was average.  The linguini frutti di mare was also average, even prepared with a white wine and garlic sauce.  The mussels were a bit chewy.    For my entree I had Fettuccine with mushrooms and artichokes.  I love artichokes in everything, so this was a win for me.  My mother had the risotto.  She said it was \"just alright.\"  However, she ate a few bites and left the rest on her plate.    My daughter was happy with a plate of spaghetti with butter and cheese.  At this price point, there are too many other better options for us to ever return.  We still had a nice time, but it was the company that saved the experience.",

I've never seen this item on a menu before, and since I'm adventurous, I decided to give it a shot and now it's my favorite thing ever.  I'll have to try out my cooking skills with this one.  Anyway, TONS of seafood in the Frutti di Mer and the sauce was delish.  Next time I order I might ask for an extra side of marinara. Also, I got the Pasta E Fagioli because I always order that when it's on a menu and that too was so yummy.  This place really feels like the italian restaurants I miss from back east.",

    "text": "This place has great food and a nice atmosphere as long as you go early or when the music hasn't started. Once the music starts, this place turns in to a totally different atmosphere/ They bring in great bands who offer great music to dance the night away to, the best bands in town really! I'd say the service is inconsistent. They are either really great or really bad. Last night we had a wonderful server, once we finally got him to come over to our table. The weekend before was mediocre at best. And a few weeks ago we had a server that pretty much ignored us all night, forgot to place our food order, never asked if we needed refills, and was more concerned with whatever was on the TV than serving us. Then we got double charged at the end of the night. Very disappointing. Some nights I go in wanting to eat, but can't place a food order because the kitchen was already closed, when it's suppose to be open til 11pm. It seems that when the owner leaves then everything shifts gears.  The ladies room is unkept at night. They always run out of toilet paper, the toilets often become backed up, they run out of paper towels to dry your hands, and the floors are gross!  It's no secret that the \"cougars\" call this place home, you'll see the occasional \"swinger\" couple, and the regulars with their weird dancing quarks. Whatever, it makes for good people watching. But what I have a problem with is having to witness couples engaging in sexual behavior in the booths and at the bar without anyone on staff saying or doing anything about it. The staff just stood in the corner watching it all go down. This is disgusting, makes your customers uncomfortable, and a health violation if you ask me. They should have been asked to leave. Instead, I had several friends leave because no one was doing anything about it. Bad for business! My other issue of concern is people being over served. I've seen this happen on several occasions. Last night a clearly drunk gal punched her date in the face. And while he left, she stayed and was able to keep drinking. I just hope she wasn't driving. Oh, and did I mention the women smoking pot in the ladies room last night? Oh, yea, that happened too. Really people?!?! Leave it at home!  I write this review because I am in here very often and have been coming for many years and want to see some changes being made, especially before the second location opens. I love this place and want to see your continued success, but please make some changes.",

I had never been but, my friend had and so glad she recommended it. The atmosphere is very nice, a little more on the classy side, but the band playing that night, had the \"classy\" people gettin jiggy wit it! We sat at the bar, and I was a little mesmerized by the many different types of Vodka they had on display... yes, they had my favorite kind of alcohol. We had a pineapple cosmotini? I think that is what he said. All I know is, it was perfect! The band played various types of R&B soul music, and the female singer even belted out a few songs en espanol! And I must say, she definitely had an amazing voice! She got all the ladies on the dance floor! Quick note on the decor, the lighting was dimmed, there was long floor-to-ceiling draperies, tones of cranberry red and champagne brown. I would definitely recommend for someone looking to take their special someone.  The seating was ample for the size of the place. The outside lounging area was also set up nice. Being from Cali, it is hard to compare places out here versus Cali. But, this one was definitely a more diverse place than the last joint we stopped at, and that is A-OK in my book! I cannot comment on the food, as our experience was more for the bar scene, but we will definitely be back again!",

    "text": "My book club met there for Happy Hour last month and if my review was based solely on that experience, I would've given 4 stars. Great lounge with ample seating, good music (loud, but not too loud, we had no problem hearing each other speak across a table of 6) and GREAT PRICES. I had 3 glasses of Chianti, the grilled veggies and the little-neck clams (with plenty of bread to sop up the delicious buttery wine sauce) and the check was just $25! Holy bargains Batman!  Unfortunately, my recent Friday night visit (6:45 - 9pm) did not leave me so giddy... There was no room in the main dining room and since this was Date Night with the hubby (as opposed to Fire Sale at The Local Meat Market) we opted for the \"quiet side of the patio\" out front. Unlike the inside, VB's front patio has ZERO ambience. And with no twinkle lights or even a faint stream of music, the view of the parking lot reinforces thoughts of hopping in the car and heading elsewhere... As far as the food goes, it started off GREAT. The scallops appetizer was nothing short of perfect (my husband concurs)--sauteed in a pesto and SO juicy. The side of greens was an ideal accompaniment, with a light vinaigrette. The entrees, on the other hand, were so disappointing... The veal marsala was meh: while it was tender enough to cut with a fork, the sauce was very generic, almost tasted like brown gravy, which is exactly what ny husband said about the sauce on his ahi tuna dish. As far as the sides of potatoes & veggies that came with the meals--on par with your average cafeteria, and unfortunately, there was no salt nor pepper on the table to remedy the absolute blandness. By the time the waitress got back to our table, I had decided not to bother requesting seasonings, as they were already cold. The dessert (chocolate cheesecake) was passable, but tasted prepackaged. As far as the service, she seemed a bit overwhelmed and unencouraging with regard to our food choices... Although we used a Groupon and therefore paid almost half of what the bill would've normally been, we were still underwhelmed.",

    "text": "Totally Impressed. Great food and people with an equal atmosphere to match. I went there on a Groupon like all of us do, thinking \"I'm just getting a good deal. I was very impressed with the level of service and wonderful food. My server Peter, will literally make you want to eat their food. Peter describes food like he should be on the food network. He didn't over sell it though, because the food he recommended was divine. The dinning atmosphere is classy enough for a first date to impress but once your finished eating, the bar on the other side of the restaurant is filled with beautiful (male and female) young professionals. Equipped with a live band, the scene is perfect for singles but not \"club weird\" that you would feel stupid to go there alone. My date and I got the total experience from Va Bene and I totally recommend checking this place out for the service and great food.",

    "text": "Why only a \"fair rating\"?  I have been to Va Bene on MANY occasions.  We decided to go for at Va Bene disappointing.  To start with, I made my New Year's Eve reservation on/or about December 1.  THAT was probably a mistake... it was too soon.  When we arrived, I was learned that they had a \"Special Limited Menu\".  I was NOT informed of that when I made my reservation.  When I called, I specifically asked and was told the menu was normal!  When I questioned the \"special limited menu\", I was told that everyone was told when they made their reservation.... NOT TRUE.  I was told that everyone was called a few days before New Year's Eve to confirm their reservation.... NOT TRUE.  I was told that when confirming the reservation, everyone was told there was a \"special limited menu\".... OBVIOUSLY NOT TRUE, because EVERYONE at all the tables around me said they were NOT CALLED.  Besides, if everyone was told there was a \"special limited menu\" when your reservation was made, WHY would you have to let everyone know when you called to confirm?  OBVIOUSLY MANAGEMENT WAS LYING!!!!!  Despite their not being truthful, the choices were \"adequate\" (about 5 entrees) and she service was excellent.  HOWEVER, we ordered the Stuffed Sea Bass and it was warm at best.  I was going to send it back, but by that time, I was already annoyed enough by the way everything was going, so I just could not be bothered.  A few other couples who did not know about the \"special limited menu\" had a difficult time with the menu.  One woman was lactose intolerant and she was unable to select many of the choices including the appetizers and desserts.  They did make a special but unimpressive special desert for her (because desert was supposed to be included with the \"special menu\").  Another couple had to leave because the woman was allergic to shell fish and most of the entrees included shell fish or shell fish ingredients.  Bottom line, this was the first and only time I was disappointed with Va Bene.  I highly recommend Va Bene, however, I would be very careful on a holiday and most certainly New Year's Eve.  I STRONGLY SUSPECT, when I made my reservation on/or about December 1, they had no idea they were going to have a \"special limited menu\" for New Year's Eve and THAT is why it was such a surprise to both myself and the other guests.  Lastly, our waiter was very good, and was obviously having difficulty with the restaurant's last minute decision to have a \"special limited menu\".  He did a very good job and made a great effort to take care of the customer's request.",

I like to sit at the bar so I don't look like I got stood up by sitting alone at a table in the dining room.  On my most recent visit, the bartender didn't seem that into help me out.  I ordered a drink and an appetizer and ended up waiting for about 20 minutes for him to return with the appetizer.  When I'd finished my first drink and appetizer, I had to flag him down to get him to come back over.  I then ordered another drink and a second appetizer.  I got my drink but 20 minutes later I flagged him down and asked him about the appetizer and he said he hadn't put in the order.  Given how slow the service was, I decided to cut my losses and was on my way.  Probably just a sub-par employee but enough to keep me from making any special effort to get back there next time I'm in town.",

I do like the bar...its nice with alot of good wines on the list... The bartenders have always been super sweet..  NOT loving much on the menu.. but I travel alot and will say my fav Italian is in the east coast.. (if not Italy itself:-) ) ..  But to counter the effects of a bit of wine.. Id recommend the bruschetta... patio..? Well it faces a parking lot.. but again.. some good stuff to watch going down out there.. like I said, cheap entertainment..

    "text": "My husband and I wanted to celebrate our anniversary somewhere special because we've had an extremely difficult year and we needed a cause for celebration.  We had one of our first dates at Va Bene and loved it so much (the only time I would have given it five stars, but that was a long time ago) that we booked the restaurant for our wedding reception.  As most brides, I don't remember much of the reception, but I was surprised to hear bad feedback several weeks after the wedding about the restaurant/reception/dinner from our guests (including my matron of honor who recommended the restaurant to us initially for our date)...so maybe they don't do wedding receptions well..I cut them some slack.  We decided to give them another try for our first anniversary and the food was awful, but the service was worse.  We left so disappointed that we didn't return until last night (many years later) at my husband's suggestion (he wanted a romantic evening).  After reading the great yelp reviews, I thought they had recovered their mojo, but they did not.  We arrived in time for our 7pm reservation, of which they did not have a record...and the hostess didn't apologize, but blamed their systems.  They were practically empty, so they had plenty of room and instead, seated us against the far wall near the kitchen entrance and a large loud table.  I mentioned to the hostess and again to our server that we were celebrating our anniversary.  The server never asked us if we wanted drinks (but we had plenty of water).  One would think that for restaurant that promotes itself as a martini and wine bar, the server would ask about drinks.  If he had asked, we may have purchased their most expensive champagne, but he never asked, never gave us a wine list and he hurried us through a cocktail-less meal.  The calamari appetizer, while huge (because it was served with a salad) was frozen.  I ordered the Va Bene salad and it was soggy. My husband ordered the linguini with seafood and it was salty and my fish (the special) was bland, the spinach was overcooked and the potatoes were undercooked.  The best thing we had was their butter for our bread. Our server did bring us a slice of cheesecake to celebrate our anniversary (I was expecting Italian style cheesecake, but it was the heavy cream NY style cheesecake...it tasted fine, but just not what I expected), but he never asked us if we wanted coffee, tea, after dinner drinks or a different dessert.  I looked around at all the other tables and they had wine, beer, coffee and tea. So I thought, \"what about our faces said we are in a hurry to get home\"?  Our date night was an hour long and really, really disappointing.  We were hurried out of an empty restaurant at 8pm.  We will not be returning for any future anniversaries.  Three strikes and Va Bene, you are out!  Our marriage on the other hand, will survive this less than ideal anniversary dinner and we will celebrate next year at an establishment that considers an anniversary special.",

We were able to have an appetizer to share, we each ordered a salad and our own Pizza and shared a desert,   the appetizer Bruschetta \"Va Bene\" was amazing  I honestly thought it was some of the best I had ever had.  the salads were amazing I had the Insalata con Rucola it had Fresh arugula with sliced apples, pecans, crumbled feta cheese in a raspberry vinaigrette. the feta cheese was so mild the flavors melded together like a dance.  The pizza I had was the Margherita and it was delicious the crust was thin yet soft and crunchy and it was just ever so lightly sauced, and totally perfect,  My friend had the Fungi Salsiccia I am not a fan at all of Mushrooms but it still looked really good. We then shared a Creme brulee and it had a wonderful light lemon flavor. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable and the wait time for every dish was minimal.   The dining room though was an experience in its self it was dimly lit but still full of drama and ambiance beautiful red velvet curtains on the windows and light cream sheers in the middle various painting that looked like Picasso's and the music was so Fun Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and the likes. I would most defiantly come here again!",

I ordered minestrone soup with pesto for lunch, it was like a clear broth (no flavor) and a can of mixed vegetables thrown in, no pasta, no flavor at all. I added pepper and Parmesan still not enough. Think twice about coming here.",

The service was non-existant, but they recovered well towards the end with apologies..  My family ALWAYS eats desert, but that was not offered.   The server never asked if we wanted appetizers, my dad wanted calamari, never asked for drinks, salads, etc.  Simply are we ready to order.  My family was unaware that options for salad or soup did not come with the entree.  There was only one other table in the restaurant, a couple.  I did see the gentleman get up and go to the kitchen entrance, so I would gather their experience was not any better than mine.  I typically always go to the lounge for happy hour and food, which is always fabulous.  This is the first time for the dining room experience.  Disappointing service experience when I was trying to impress my family with an Ahwautukee location.  My parents dine out 300 of the 365 days of the year, and travel extensively.  But, I must say the SALMON and the Stuffed PORK was truly AMAZING.",

It sounded good a white fish grouper I think.  With a bed of a pasta.     It was ok nothing to write home about.   My pasta was good as usual under $15.     But when I got the bill $28.00 for the fish plate.  It was worth half  at best. And the waiter said nothing of the price      I have learned a lesson at this restaurant, no specials for us and I will alway have the sting of $28 for the fish.      For the owners have your staff announce the price of your specials.   It felt like a scam in a tourist area.    And if you have a $28 plate make it worth it.",

We ordered 2 of the gamberi pasta, 2 pork breaded cutlets, 1 veal masala and 1 chicken with asparagas.  All meals were nice but I can't say out of this world pretty simple family style serving with mash and vegetables with the meat.    Will be back again with groupons:)",

European-style service means there is always a server (or helper) at the ready, but they basically leave you alone to enjoy your selections. We did not want for anything, nor did we ever need to search for a waiter. Varied affordable menu choices include authentic recipes and offerings. Extensive wine list means there is something for every taste (and budget).",

The Caesar salad was so loaded with dressing ( after asking for light dressing) I couldn't eat it- our clueless server did acknowledge it when I told her ( she didn't notice bringing it out?) so she brought me a caprese salad that had little flavor in tomatoes or cheese.  I had asked for shrimp to be added to my pasta.  Wasn't there... Since it was delivered by someone else she wasn't there to notice it.  She was on a computer screen not far from our table telling them I ordered shrimp over and over (while she stayed at the computer) and they finally took back and added shrimp.  The meal itself was nothing great, even with the shrimp.  My guest had the veal Marsala and said it was great.",

The restaurant is billed as a wine bar, but not one Malbec to be found. We enjoyed our shrimp appetizer, and the Spinach salad was interesting and well dressed. Big disappointment with both entrees. The veal Marsala was pounded so thin, that it resembled jerky breaded when it made it to the table. For $25 dollars, Olive Garden does a better job.  The stuffed pork loin suffered from being dried out and virtually tasteless.  The cardinal sin on both entrees was frozen, bland vegetables straight out of the steamer.  The $95 bill was just a waste of money.  Chef needs to get out of the 1980's and come up with better selections and plate presentation.",

Our waiter walked away from us while we were ordering our drinks and said \"hold on\" before coming back, which was rude.   We ordered the clams and they were so salty they were inedible and i can handle salt. The waiter gave us an excuse about where the clams come from and that's why they're salty. After saying we didn't want them, he awkwardly offered the mussels which we accepted. They were over cooked and cold. The white wine broth tasted like water.  I ordered the ribeye and orzo Risotto that was on their specials. The steak was cooked correctly but I don't believe it was a ribeye cut because it tasted like a steak from Marie Calendars and despite looking pink and delicious it was still somehow tough and chewy. The risotto was very good though.  All in all the food is way over priced for the quality. I would not come back here.",

They took their time on serving and the food was authentic. The gnocchi was a little overcooked but the manager (can't remember his name) and server, Sergio, made it right. They were both great (as were the bus boys) and made our experience at this restaurant perfect. Veal Parm (not on the menu) and Veal Marsala was delicious, as were the sides.

    "text": "We were looking for a nice place to enjoy a quiet dinner. Since we not from the area we took a chance based on the Yelp reviews and I'm happy to repetitious that Va Bene is a winner. The dimly lit interior sets the mood. The wine list has some nice choices across the price ranges and the menu has the standard as well as some unique dishes. We started with a glass of Pinot Grigio to accompany the Mussels with Sausage. The light red sauce was tasty and this interesting combination was great. We each had a salad next. Both the Caesar and Mediterranean salads were good. Fresh veggies and decent dressing. We ordered a Chianti to accompany the Mains. Chicken W/ Asparagus in. Lemon sauce with fresh mashed potatoes and Broccoli was excellent. Tender chicken and veggies cooled to perfection. The Rotini w/ Eggplant was also wonderful. Cubes of eggplant in a rich fresh tomato sauce.",

    "text": "This restaurant is poorly run.  3 of the last take out orders have had items missing and this is after having the order read back to you each time.  We had mistakes made on our last meal while eating in house.  This is all within the last 6 mos.  The wine is served at room temp, which is typically 72-74, odd for a \"wine bar\".  The quality of what you receive in house is par at best.  Their protein dishes are usually over cooked.  The sauces are often bland, heavy and in dire need of brightening.  A positive is their pasta which is usually prepared well.  After my last complaint the acting manager confirmed they had been receiving similar complaints lately.  Yeah, I can imagine.  Here's my question, how long does it take to fix these issues?  Apparently more than 6 mos.  Avoid this restaurant, there are better Italian restaurants in the area.  Really seems like they're not interested in improving here.",

I ordered a Mediteranian Salad, Pollo Fungi Alfredo and a Margerita. The salad was perfect, you can't believe how many restaurants can mess up a salad, not these guys! The fresh French loaf had a subtly divine flavored butter. Then the Chicken and mushroom Alfredo, best I've ever had, amazing. Then there's the service, Impeccable! It was such a nice change to have a quality dining experience, I can't remember the last time I had such a fine meal, this is lunch mind you. I love Margeritas, hard to find a good mixologist but Peter knows his stuff, perfecto! Don't you just know I asked for cheesecake? Right in line with the rest of the meal, superb. Friends, the prices are extraordinarily reasonable. Thank Va Bene for being top notch, my favorite new dining establishment!",

The bruschetta was ok. It was just mainly tomatoes on it. I felt like a slice of cheese with it would've been perfect. It was no meat friday again so these items were perfect. The Melanzane was good. It's baked and filled with eggplant, cheese, zucchini, etc. I felt they could use some more items on their appetizer menu. It's mainly all seafood. Mussels, calamari, scallops etc.   For the drinks... I was kind of shocked that they don't have a drink menu. They don't have a regular drink menu, wine menu, or anything. You basically tell them what you want and that's it. The first time, I ordered a Strawberry Martini while my friend got a Cosmo. Then we told our waitress, can you just have the bartender mix up a fruity martini. I'm not sure what was in it, but it was really good! The good news is their martinis are really good and they're a steal! $4!   I would really recommend having a drink menu though, maybe throwing some specialty drinks on it along with a wine list and perhaps expanding the happy hour menu with the appetizers. I'd come back for a martini though for a price like that! =)",

Ate in the dining room twice prior and it was just spectacular. We went to the bar last night and were waited on by the awesome Shelly. Great wine by the glass, superb Calamari with that special sauce and then the Penne Siciliana with the eggplant and just the right amount of garlic was Bene indeed. Made me want to do my Robert de Niro \" Godfather II\"  impression \" Bene, Bene.\" We also got the Margherita pizza which was great - loved the basil. Awesome band with an amazing singer. She was very versatile and went from modern pop to good ol' Bob Marley. Dance floor was jamming. Shelly and the staff were on their game and took very good care of us. Really cool to experience this side of Va Bene after enjoying Sinatra and the other Goldies in the main restaurant with the dim lighting, great atmosphere and very, very good food. Loved it!

AND, Happy Hour is EVERY DAY starting at 4, and ALL DAY on Sunday and Monday.  As far as drinks go, in addition to beer and wine, they have a huge variety of marvelous martini's featuring Grey Goose and Skyy specials. The Blueberry Lemon Drop Martini was our favorite. In the past, I have also enjoyed the Espresso Martini.   The appetizers are amazing, and all but the scallops are half price. And even full price, the scallops are worth every penny; huge scallops, perfectly cooked and served with a heaping side salad of field greens and tomatoes, perfectly dressed with a light vinaigrette. I sometimes get this for my meal.   The Bruschetta is good if you're not afraid of garlic and the Antipasto Misto is a great dish to share. The Calamari Fritti is tasty, which is also served with a small side salad. (Yes, I eat the garnish.  What? It's good!!)   Other favorites include the Gamberoni con Prosciutto (proscuitto wrapped shrimp) and the Carpaccio, both big winners! The complimentary bread is soft and served with delicious roasted red pepper butter, very yummy! The staff is always sure to keep the breadbasket and water glasses full at all times.   By the time we are finished, we are all pleasantly stuffed, slightly buzzed, and 100% happy!",

The clams in wine sauce were perfect!  The mussels were smaller than ours in the Northwest so I enjoyed them much more, they were in a sauce that is indescribable!  Your mouth falls in love!  The champagne vinaigrette on the spinach salad was obviously homemade and could never be duplicated, sad. And the calamari was excellent with a garlic mayonnaise.  The second time we were there we sat outside during happy hour and the place was completely packed and the wonderful staff managed to take care of all of us timely and friendly.

As of late their bar at happy hour seems to be the place to be.  I have gone here for both lunch and dates. For lunch the place is strangely empty and it can be a bit awkward, but decent.  For dates it is great, the dining room has a classy quiet atmosphere. The bread with the sun dried tomato butter is great.   If you hear about a special that sounds good ask the price as I was surprised by my $32 mahi mahi special on one trip. It was good however.  I typically opt for the ganocci al la vodka sans chicken. The al la vodka sauce is bright and has a luxurious mouth feel. The Gnocci have a great texture, with a nice chewy firmness that one expects in them.  The parking lot can get a bit crowed, so you may need to park closer to  Kohles.",

I finally asked him for our bill and he was very rude. Told me he was getting it but it was difficult with so many people and all having separate bills.

The service was perfectly fine.  The food was great.    The tomato bruschetta was excellent.  The gnocchi (specifically ordered due to William H, 8/18/12 yelp review) was very very good.    Not ready to give 5 stars yet, would like to go and see how they do when busier.  But I will go back!",

The Melanzane Ripieni (eggplant and squash-both I love) was good, but extremely cheesy (which many will like!) Good drink prices for happy hour and a nice fire pit table outside if you want to attempt it in the winter :) I will be back!",

Four of us girls dined here for dinner and sat at a high table in the bar area.  Our server was friendly and attentive and the bartender even came over and chatted it up with us.    We all had wine and I went with a Malbec.  It was a good choice recommended by the bartender.  When our server brought over bread and butter, I was so excited to see that it wasn't normal butter. I love when restaurants don't have normal butter and the sundried tomato and basil butter exceeded my butter expectations.  For starters, we shared the clams and fried calamari.  The clams were in a olive oil, garlic, and oregano broth and dipping the bread in it made it even better.  The clams were baby clams and were good, but a bit gritty.  I liked the calamari.  They were light, and even thought the garlic sauce on them was good, I'm old school Italian and would have preferred traditional marinara or fra diavlo dipping sauce.  Like many other Yelpers, I went with the Gnocchi alla Vodka.  I'm an Gnocchi snob, but Va Bene passes my Gnocchi test.  Definitely homemade, light and fluffy.  The sauce was SO flavorful.  I only ordered a half order of the Gnocchi and was kicking myself after for not getting a whole order!    One thing I did not like about the restaurant was that the music was on a pop station.  If I'm in a nice Italian restaurant, I don't feel like listening to Lady Gaga.  I know they have live Jazz on the weekends, so why not play Jazz music on the radio every night?!",

I think the best italian I have had in phoenix.  Had a spinach salad and bruschetta which was SO good.  Bruschetta was one of the best I have had anywhere.  Had a Sausage and peppers in a red Cream Sauce.  Very very tasty.  Food was way better than I thought it would be.    Just might go for happy hour today because I am cravin the itailian and the cougar atmosphere is a good one.",

Appetizers were delish - prosciutto wrapped prawns, bruschetta and eggplant drenched in cheese and marinara sauce. The wine list was pricey and not that impressive of a selection. They don't have a cocktail menu, but have some specialty drinks that the bartender will tell you about if you ask. The ambiance was just ok for the prices. The bartender was really funny and full of great suggestions.    This is NOT a place I would take my preschooler - the restaurant would not mind, but there's no kid food on the menu and there is nothing entertaining about the ambiance.  Apparently, this place is a wild dance club in disguise! The place turns into a dance floor on Friday and Saturday nights where the 70's, 80's and 90's music is pumpin. If you want to shake your thing in Ahwatukee, this seems to be the place. (I may just try it out and report back.)",

The ambiance is fit for that \"I-must-impress-her\" first date or that \"darn-I-forgot-our anniversary-again\" make-up and make-out dinner.   The ambiance is cozy and classy (white linens, and no red check table cloths) the staff are attentive and knowledgeable about the food...now that's important, especially if you don't understand Italian.  They serve lunch, and I've had their smoked chicken fettucine pasta, which is one of their lunch specials ($9-10?). The sauce was excellent--creamy, but not heavy, and punctuated with the saltiness of pancetta, if I'm not mistaken. The chicken was cooked (maybe grilled) just right, a bit on the smoky side to add another texture to the overall flavor.   Now if you are on that date--whether it be with your spouse, significant other, or whomever--you HAVE to start your dinner with some cocktails and appetizers at the bar, where they have Happy Hour from 4-7 p.m. Tues-Saturdays. The appetizers (calamari, baby!) are half-off, plus drink specials.   Bellissimo! I'm telling you...",

We happened to go on a very slow night for a nice italian restaurant/bar, because it was the same night the NFL conference championships were playing. We tried the bacon wrapped shrimp (4 pieces of small shrimp) as an appetizer, and I was very disappointed by the overcooked, tasteless pieces of shrimp. I chose the \"special\" for the night, which was not very special. It was described by the waitress as a \"Prime Porterhouse\" steak, with brussell sprouts cooked with bacon and pecans as a side. The steak was definitely not as tender as prime beef should be, and it was a T-bone at best, NOT a porterhouse size portion as described. This mediocre dish was $38, which is more expensive than anything on the regular menu. Being that it was a \"special\", I did not think to ask the price before ordering. The only good thing about this place was the stiff drinks that our waitress poured. Other than that, I probably wont have any reason to go back anytime soon.",

On the restaurant side, dinners are terrific and the Chef's Specials should always be considered.  Great service and friendly staff.  Va Bene is a gem in the area.

Without being snobby, of course.   Atmosphere: up-scale Italian-American.   Food: outstanding. The \"Zuppa di Funghi\", a mushroom soup, was out of this world. In perusing their website just now I'm surprised by the lower price of the main entrees, relative to their quality. It's still a bit pricey so I don't come here often.

It was a Tuesday night around 7:30, and we were dressed casually, so when the hostess told us we could sit in the bar area (which is very large) we opted for that. Probably not the best choice, because as the night went on the music got louder.  We found their wine list adequate and ordered a lovely bottle of Valley of the Moon sangiovese. That was probably the best thing we had all night, sadly. Our server was lovely, I must say. Very charming and upbeat. We ordered the calamari appetizer to share, which was pretty good. The batter and sauce were tasty, the squid a little chewy. But I liked that it came with a salad of romaine and tomatoes on the side. Good combination! Then came the entrees..I had the Veal Marsala and my husband ordered the New York Steak medium rare. The Veal was good and tender, but the mushroom sauce tasted like it came right out of a can. My husbands steak was cooked medium well, not rare, which he was very grumpy about. And the veggies they served along side were cold and hard and obviously frozen. One more chance: dessert. We ordered a tiramisu to share...on the recommendation of our server....and it was very ordinary, and tasted like it came from a grocery store.  I have heard this place does have a great happy hour and I saw they did grey goose martinis (my favorite) If we were ever to return, I wouldn't mind trying those! And probably munch on the calamari....and forget the rest of the food.",

First was a Mexican food chain where the waiter greeted us with a free dessert sampler after spending countless minutes describing our new home (while dealing with 4-5 other tables, too), so we weren't expecting much.  On the contrary, we were extremely pleased by what we found.  Our bartender, Randy, remembered us on our second visit which was over a month after our first.  Now, we go as often as I'm home and enjoy a solid happy hour filled with cheap well drinks, beers, house wines, and half-price apps.  After a few drinks and an appetizer or two, we're always ready cross the street to our apartment and \"cook.\"    Va Bene features live music at least once per week and is loaded with cougars, so bring your magnums if you're in the mood to hunt...
