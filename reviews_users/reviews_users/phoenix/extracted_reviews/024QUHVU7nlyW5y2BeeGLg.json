With choices to sit, eat, and drink at 1) the bar, 2) tables, 3) teppan table, and 4) sushi bar - you can live it up in many delicious ways!  Located near other good sushi places, this one you may not see from the street.  So I think this place is more known by the locals, and oh so good.  Very nice service, and less pretentious than the others just up the street.  I recommend this for a couple on a date, or a small group.  The teppan table seats 6 or 8, which is also fun for a little party, anniversary, birthday, etc.",

To start, we all ordered the miso soup- IT WAS EXTRAODINARY! I would live off that soup if I could. It had so many mushrooms in it which I love. For my meal,  I got the chicken in teriyaki sauce- which came with salad, rice, and orange slices. I ate it all. The best part all of my meal was only $6.   I had friends get the sashimi and the tempura bento boxes. I think I might try the tempura box the next time we go. The server and host were very nice.",

He said no, i need to back it in so i can pull it out easier. I said is valet parking required in this lot? He said no, to which i responded i didnt valet so youre not pulling my car out. I understand it was slow and he wasn't getting any tips but i didn't appreciate someone trying trick me into something. When we got there we had about an hour n a half to eat n get to our movie. The service was slow, it took forever to get any food and they only brought out one item at a time. We sat there for a long time with empty plates before the next came out. We ordered 5 things so it took a very very long time and they had 4 or 5 sushi chefs and it was not busy. By the third i had to ask them to see what was going on because we had a movie to catch. The food was pretty good though. Aside from that our waitress only checked on us once at the end of the night and the plates were pretty visibly worn. Which i know I'm anal but it bothers me. Get some decent plates they shouldn't be full of chips and wear. The manager comped me for taking so long with our food but i dont care about $10 I care about good service. Overall not a good experience. Pretty disappointed because i used to go there a lot years ago and i told my gf how good it was and they made me a liar lol. I wouldn't go back. Good sushi places are a dime a dozen now and if im eating raw fish id like to see that they take their job seriously.",

My biggest beef(or tuna) with Kyoto is their lack of sympathy for people with service animal. They DO NOT allow service animals in their restaurant.  We have two Yorkies and they are our service  dogs.  We have never been denied access to a restaurant before. This is not very AMERICAN. Maybe it's a Japanese thing:(  Anyway NO GO for animal lovers!",

    "text": "Came in for dinner with a party of 10. Booked a reservation last minute and unfortunately did not read the reviews fully. Not impressed. The first problem was when we asked for the sushi to come out as appetizers and our server condescending told us that they can try but it \"depends on how backed up the sushi guys are\". That's an actual direct quote. This server was not attentive, constantly darting away from the table before we could ask for drinks, silverware, etc. The beef bullion soup that comes at the beginning of the meal tasted like they put sliced mushrooms in a bowl of ramen broth. No complaints about teppanyaki chef, but one of the tricks resulted in an actual ball of fire igniting startlingly close to the head of the four year old at the table (this is no exaggeration as we have it recorded on video). Other off putting things about this restaurant include a $7.00 up charge for fried rice and miso soup instead of the ramen broth and steamed rice it came with, crazy loud customers at other tables, bussers and food runners who literally put down plates of food hanging off of the table, and the large screen TVs in the background playing a True crime cold case file complete with closed captioning. The icing on the cake was when we waited almost 10 minutes for the server to pick up the cash payment portion of our bill (large party and some paid in cash some with cards) and she never came. We finally just got up and left- leaving the money on the table- and the hostess stopped my mother at the door and said \"excuse me miss, did you pay the rest of your bill?\". Not a nice way to treat your customers- especially when they have a check close to 400 dollars. I'd like to reiterate that the food wasn't bad but won't be coming back. It was an awkward and unwelcoming experience.",

We ordered scallops (received 2) and the chicken and steak were just ok, certainly not worthy of the $38.00+ cost. The chef, although nice enough, did not have the skill to pull off this type of cooking. ..",

Sure, this would make it like all those other places...except this meant we only got to watch the chef make our grilled veggies and meat.  It made for a slightly less exciting experience.

    "text": "Sushi: 2/5 I ordered softshell crab maki roll and another maki roll that I can't quit recall the name of it.  Kyoto's softshell crab roll was salty and excessively over-battered.  At first, I blamed myself for soaking my sushi in too much soy sauce but bites after bites; I still tasted salt even when there was no added soy sauce.  Last piece, I separately tried the softshell crab by itself and all I tasted was salt.  The other roll was consisted of several different types of fish folded with a central piece of avocado.  The roll was served deep-fried in a pool of sauce.  A tint of sourness of their sauce was a surprising taste and quite unique.  However, I was not impressed.  The creativity was appreciated but the execution needed some more work.  In addition, I found their menu(s) very confusing.  Kyoto's main menu only lists tappenyaki items.  They also have a separate laminated sushi menu that was given to us to share among eight people?, which only contains a few maki items.  I was very confused when I was also given another different sushi order menu that lists additional nigiri and maki rolls in their own acronyms.  How many hoops do I have to jump through in order to get my sushi ordered?  The acronyms without any descriptions were worthless to be given to the customers.  They were nothing more than scribbles on a piece of paper.  Tappenyaki: 3/5 I can't judge on how good the food tastes but I sure enjoyed their impressive performance.  The flaming volcanic onion, the fire surrounded the teppan, the style and technique of cutting with their aciculate knife in a blink of an eye.  Unfortunately, the show was the highlight of our dining experience at Kyoto restaurant and hopefully the food tasted as good as the performance.  Service: No Star? Dian, our server, despicably greeted us with her agitated facial expression as we asked for our separate checks soon after we were seated.  She scowled as she informed us that there will be a 20% gratuity on our bills because the large number of party.  Everybody gladly agreed and acknowledged.  What remains bothersome was the fact that she was paid 20% of our combined bills to do her job, the job she was already paid to do.  With her attitude and incompetence, she sure did not deserve her tip.  Servers are supposed to be motivated to provide great service with the tip they are receiving at the end of their customers' meals.  I usually don't mind paying for x% gratuity when I am with a big party but this is a perfect example of how one takes advantage of the system.     The night didn't just end with just her grumpiness.  Just out of a friend's curiosity, he asked Dian politely if the restaurant carried Inarizushi.  Dian ignorantly replied, \"I do not speak Japanese.\" I just didn't believe that came out of our server's mouth to a customer that was paying for her atrocious service.  Not only she was ignorant as a waitress at a Japanese restaurant, she could easily come across rude and offensive.   And yes, the rudeness and grouchiness went on the whole night, from the beginning to end.  Parking and etc: 2/5 Kyoto is located in Old Town, Scottsdale, which is probably the only good thing this place has to offer.  It is close to those who are looking forward to the night life in downtown Scottsdale.  They also have their own private parking lot, which is definitely a plus.  However, Kyoto didn't appear to be that busy as we arrived and we still waited for at least half an hour, perhaps more.  By the time we were seated, there were many guys and girls in their mini black dresses sitting on the benches and overflowing the bar area.  Leaving Kyoto with an extreme disappointment, I was surprised how Kyoto is surviving the recession with such poor food and their horrific service.   This restaurant is by far the worst I have tried in Scottsdale.   So, do not waste your time and money because there are many other strong candidates out there in the area.  Overall, Kyto deserves 2/5 with no star in service in my opinion.",

If you are looking for a place with good sushi at a reasonable price and a friendly staff to serve you, then visit Kyoto.

The food is fine, about the same as Hon Machi in Chandler, or that place on Elliott in Ahwatukee.  They get two stars because when I pay money, I'm paying for service. Otherwise, I can stay home.

Had the Beef Sashimi extra spicy -- so awesome.   The fried rice is the best.  Just the best most authentic Sushi in Az.  Masa started this place long ago, he would be proud that the food is still the best sushi in Az     Try the Saki bombers, they have 12 flavors.  Perfect local joint*****",

From the amazing lunch bento boxes that are very decently priced to the sushi and teppenyaki tables.  Sitting at the sushi bar is the way to go!  All the guys back there are awesome and fun to watch.  Brandon is the best!  Group nights you have to do the teppenyaki tables! Entertaining and good food.  I have had many birthday celebrations growing up at those teppenyaki tables.  I am such a creature of habit here but I can't help it - I love it!!  My go to's: Tako Salad (the spicy ponzu is heaven in a liquid - I want the recipe!), house salad (also obsessed with this dressing - best in town) & Crazy Roll (Shrimp Tempura and Spicy Tuna - you cant go wrong) get it with a side of the spicy ponzu and its a party in your mouth! My dad always gets the salmon kama and its so delicate and perfectly cooked.  Something new to the menu that I now love is the crispy rice with spicy tuna.  I could go on and on.  Just come try for yourself.",

Service was amazing bussers came by assuring we had drinks filled and tables clean and our server was very attentive of our needs. Definitely 5 out of 5!!!!

    "text": "Alright, lets set a few things straight. My experience equates to a three, yes, however I was almost tempted to give it a 4, simply to offset some of the ridiculously unjustified one or two star reviews I've read below.   *To complain about the tuna in a spicy tuna roll being mashed, because it ruins the texture and the flavor of the tuna? Sincerely, if its texture and integrity of tuna flavor that your looking for perhaps you shouldn't be eating a roll where traditionally, you \"mash\" the tuna, adding a slew of \"spicy\" seasonings into it? Try the sashimi perhaps? Just a thought.  *To give a restaurant a 2star rating because they didn't provide noodles like Benihana? Also might be an unfair comparison.   *Another 2 star rating because they didnt like the hostess stand being by the door? I'm not even sure I understand this complaint.  Anyhow, here goes my own personal experience.  Promptly greeted and as the restaurant was full, even on an off night, were seated at the sushi bar, which is fine, because its where we wanted to go anyhow. Ordered a cocktail from their slightly pedestrian bar offerings. A little surprised that the edamame wasn't complimentary, but didn't mind too much since, one - i think this might be a Scottsdale thing - and two, both it and the soup, as many people have stated, were very inexpensive. Ordered sushi, and a few tidbits from the kitchen, Server was nice, friendly and as attentive as could have been expected as busy as she was. Sushi was slightly undersized in portions (and yes, even for classic Japanese standards) but when the bill came, it reflected the size fittingly, leaving no thoughts as to it being over-priced. Sushi Chef (not the owner.) was skilled but seemed either lacking in rapport with the guests, or just too busy to show some sense of personality.*shrug, but i suppose as long as he gets the job done, thats all that matters. Experience was altogether pleasing, but did seem as if there was always a ying to the yang to consistently make the 4 star experience back to a 3.   PROS: *Pleasant server               *Good sushi, quality fish, nice cuts.               *Undersized portions but also very reasonable price tags  CONS:   *Fairly pedestrian bar and sake selections.                   Bar i can forgive, but wish the sake selection was a little                   more interesting.                  *No little freebies that you see in some other Japanese                   restaurants. Edamame, Soup, even the rice, yep..paid for.                 * No desserts available whatsoever. Nada, Zip Zilch.  You know what? I AM going to give it a 4, because if the pricing, quality and service for lunch is anything like dinner, I'm still a fan and ill definitely be trying this place again. (Also, like i said to help offset some of what I think are those unfair one and two star reviews.) True, nothing blew me away about the experience...but definitely nothing so overwhelming  bad to deserve a 1 or 2 star review. Next time I'm craving sushi, Kyoto will work just fine. Hope this helps!",

I was amazed at how cheap their lunch specials are and even more amazed that it was actually quite good.  The chicken was soft moist white meat with a tasty teriyaki sauce and mushrooms.  I really enjoyed the sauce, because it wasn't sickeningly sweet or heavy.  The salad was as simple as they come... just some iceberg lettuce with a surprisingly flavorful dressing.  I am not sure what the dressing was made of, but my best guess is some combination of peanut, soy and ginger.  Very tasty!  It was really the perfect amount of food for the lunch hour.  I walked away full and satisfied, but not so full that I had to fight the post-lunch food coma.",

Now I love sushi and have been to many places in town so I have much to compare it to.  But the reason I come here more than any other place is I can enjoy a great sashimi lunch for less than $10 dollars or come have dinner plus drinks for around $25.  That makes me and my wallet very happy.  I walk to it from work and have lunch usually once a week. Have taken 3 of my stylist who have never been there before and turned them in to Kyoto fans.  The service is great, really friendly and I like that they recognize me always asking \"how's business?  Good to see you again!\"  It is another place here in old town that make me feel like I am not lost in the tourist shuffle.",

    "text": "My mom and I were drawn in by the reasonably priced lunch menu and convenient location- but we quickly discovered that the reasonable menu equated terrible food.  The lunch menu is priced so reasonably ($5-$8 for a complete bento box) that I worried about the quality of the food as we placed our order.  My mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box.  Neither of us liked the salad dressing (too much ginger), although people who like ginger will probably enjoy it.  I literally had to spit out my first bite of sashimi (tuna).  It was the most fishy and rough piece of fish I've ever tasted.  It was absolutely atrocious and the flavor remained in my mouth long after i spit it out.  After that first bite, I decided against trying the other sashimi out of concern that I would get sick.  My mom's chicken was also terrible- she described it as tough and over cooked.  We politely told the waitress (an older lady, possibly the owner) that we were both unable to eat our meals.  She rudely informed me that the fish was fresh and there was nothing wrong with it.  (note: if that is what they consider fresh fish, then their standards are VERY low).  I apologized and told her that I was unable to eat it.  She grabbed the plate away, but refused to take my mother's food (stating that there was nothing wrong with the chicken).  Another waitress came by and we explained the situation to her.  She was very nice and apologized, and my mom and I left the restaurant.  The food was so atrocious that we literally left without eating!",

Pony up to the bar for some savory (and surprisingly super cheap) saki bombs while you wait, and you'll forget you actually came to eat.  If you still have an urge to eat, do it right and get both sushi and a tepan-cooked meal...you'll be impressed and its not overpriced, you get a ton of food.

That just goes to show the chef does not know Japanese cuisine.  I ordered dragon roll, which is eel and avocado. Overall flavor is okay but the texture of the fish is mushier than usual that it makes me think perhaps it's not fresh.  The green tea. Watered down. Not much flavor.  Edamame.

For the first 2 years living in Old Town I thought this place was closed down.  The shutters are always closed and looks dark in the outside but I'm very happy to find it open.  I've only had the sushi and not the tepenyaki.  Like what others said, prices are very good for Old Town and quality is good.  It's 10,000 times better than Ra.  Granted the atmosphere isn't hip but you're there for the sushi, right?  If you want atmosphere go to Ra.",

    "text": "There is something about Yelp that compels me to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God.  So before I get to the bad, I'll tell you about the good. Kyoto is so fun.  I've been going there for years and it's pretty much a guaranteed good time- especially if you sit at a cooking table.  Keep in mind that the cooking tables really fill up quickly, so if you're looking to get one for a larger party for a Friday or Saturday night, you definitely need to get that reservation in early on in the week. Smaller parties can usually be squeezed in to the tables without thaaat long of a wait.    The environment is always lively at Kyoto- maybe it's the sake...I don't really know. But this is definitely not the spot for a quiet, romantic dinner.  People are always yelling, laughing and talking very loudly here and it's often the scene for birthday and graduation celebrations.  In fact, when it's your birthday, they bring out something I can only describe as a washcloth shaped weener with a cherry on top. They also sing and give you a coffee mug that has pictures of sushi all around it.    I got this mug a few years ago and after a few shots, found it so funny that I became absolutely determined not to lose it during the night ahead of me. I somehow (and I say this with great pride) kept that mug in my bag the whole night and still have it today.    I think the food is good at Kyoto too and the sushi is pretty decent.  But the fried rice is what dreams are made of.  Try it and you'll know what I mean. My best friend and I used to go to Kyoto some nights before we went out and sit at the bar with a drink in one hand and a bowl of fried rice in the other. Forget the cooking tables- that's all we needed.   Now I have to end this review on a bad note, but keep in mind that although it took me about a year to return after the 'incident,' I still did return nonetheless and still go to Kyoto on occasion.  This happened probably five years ago, but I will never forget it. My friend and I ordered sake and were pouring it into the little sake glass when we noticed something black had poured out with it.  A horrified little peak into the glass revealed it was a large, hideous roach! AAAAARGH. It still freaks me out. The glass was thrown and we made quite a scene, but upon telling the bartender, the only response he gave back to us was \"well, was it alive?\" DOES IT MATTER?   He comped us two gin and tonics and sent us on our way and that was that.  I know from working in the service industry that all restaurants and clubs have roaches, it's just a fact of life. You can do your best to maintain it, but those little bastards keep on coming. I don't completely blame Kyoto or think the place is infested with roaches but it still was a little traumatizing for someone that is deathly afraid of those hideous monsters.  It took me awhile to return, but I still go, I just won't order the sake. If you do, please do me a favor and look in the little sake bottle before you pour it.",

We sat for an hour and 30 minutes before we got drinks. What a joke! When I approached the manager he said he would see what was going on. Shortly after the chefs arrived to prepare our meal. I thought things were course corrected.  But then... We never got our soup and when asked about it the staff said sorry- we will take care of it. They never did. When we finished our meal we sat for 45 mins waiting for the birthday celebration. I had to find the manager again to find out what was going on. Again... he said he'd figure it out...but then We literally had a server and another staff member come to a table of 18 to sing. Pathetic!! Of course - another 20 mins for a check. As we were walking out there was another table with a birthday celebration. They had 5 staff members and the coward restaurant manager singing for them. As we left the restaurant I waited for the manager at the front..his response to the poor service - NOTHING! Not a word. 100% lack of accountability!!! $1000 check and not even an \"I'm sorry\"! Inexcusable!!! Save yourself the disappointment... don't drop a dine in this establishment. Btw- during all of this I made two trips to the bar to get drinks for the whole table when we had a server!!! Yes - I am a former food server. I know what is acceptable and what is inexcusable. This was simply inexcusable!",

I had tried Kyoto years ago and found it pretty disappointing in terms of sushi quality, but since it has remained open, I decided to give it another try in case I had simply had a poor initial experience.  I have now tried it twice in two weeks, and it still is a generally disappointing experience. While the lunch menu prices are great, the sashimi quality remains off. The first week it just tasted bland, and the second week is was bland, overly wet and spongy in texture to the point that I was slightly nervous about eating it.  Both times I had the Sashimi lunch special which is nicely priced. Each time, my miso soup was barely warm, and not very flavorful.  The first week I also had a spicy tuna hand roll, which was substantial in size, but totally lacking flavor and spice. The tuna preparation was generally incorrect.  Service was just ok, and both times my server failed to check back with me after delivering my food to be sure it was ok.   Perhaps the cooked dishes are a better choice.",

When we arrived at 745 we gave our name and the hostess looked for us and clearly didn't find our name but said \"we will seat you closer to your reservation\". We grabbed drinks at the bar... bartender was fun, talkative, and never let our drinks get low. The bar area was very crowded and not comfortable area to sit long term. At 830 the hostess came to get us and it was much more apparent they hadn't written down our reservation as they attempted to sit us with a full table in the corner up against a bookshelf. The hostess realized this was not going to work and sat us solo at a grill. We then waited until 940 for our chef to come to us. The show was half as exciting as everyone around us. My filet was over cooked and the other food was sub par.",

We had 2 rolls, 2 chicken entrees and 3 drinks for $45. I felt the food was mediocre but I'd overlook that in lieu of the wholesome experience, plus I am not a huge fan of sushi anyway. All in all, it was an awesome experience and I would recommend this as a must try for a night of dining fun!",

These prices cannot be found anywhere else...ESPECIALLY NOT in old town.   Their rolls are unbelievably cheap too! I had an order of oysters one day and it was...AMAZING!

    "text": "* Kyoto * - This used to be our \"go-to\" sushi place when we were in College.  Literally a sushi roll stuffed with quality fish was $2.99.  Fast forward 20 years and; as expected, the prices have grown with inflation significantly.  The quality is still decent, but lacks imagination.  I am not sure if that is good or bad.  Many sushi restaurants are getting a little to creative for my liking.  I prefer standards like \"Maki, Sashimi or Hand Rolls\".  Kyoto is a good time and should be experienced at least once.  The bar gets quite crowded and they also do Teppanyaki which is very popular.  So, if you want to avoid the crowds, hit them up for lunch; or, dinner Sunday - Wednesday.  They are located right in the heart of Old-Town; so, go eat some decent sushi then stroll around town and see what kind of trouble you can stay out of!",

I will never go back here again with the horrible service we had. We were a large party for non teppanyaki my first complaint is my sister in-laws silverware napkin had broken glass in it! YES BROKEN GLASS! She could of seriously hurt herself, she is very quite so choose not to make it a big deal. Another complaint is I order a California roll and when it came there was no soy sauce on the table so I asked my server for some and she rolled her eyes at me and walked away. That is extremely rude and horrible service I'm sorry if your job sucks but don't be rude to a paying customer! Another issue was how long it took to receive our food, I understand your busy but it seriously took almost 49 minutes to receive our food and when I received my chicken teriyaki bento box it was cold, and the chicken teriyaki was not even good it tasted gross. My last issue was when we needed our checks they didn't even bother to ask if we wanted separate checks or one all together and it took forever just to get our checks and pay. I would not come back here ever the food was cold and not good, I don't understand how you can mess up on chicken teriyaki. Plus you need to get new servers, for a server to be so rude to roll her eyes over a simple question and I was nice. My whole table noticed how cold and rude your server was.

Well, I'm not an expert on sushi but have tried quite a bit of places for omakase. What really stands out this place from the others is the combination of the freshness of the fish and the sauce pairing, also comes with a fresh wasabi, Pickled Ginger, California Roll and Edamame. It isn't the cheapest, but a good value for money that couples a good mix of prepared food and sushi. The Prime Beef Teriyaki is also a must try! Plus! A good sake list that runs the spectrum of prices. When it comes to service, based on my experience, it was a two thumbs up quality! I had the chance to talk to the chef, and he's very personable welcoming. The rest of the staff was pretty accommodating too, and they always wear their smile while doing their job.

I thought about ordering the tofu but for $18 I didn't think it would be worth it since I wouldn't have anyone to share my meal with and I was not super hungry. The service there was great, they were super accommodating to me being a vegetarian. They cooked the vegetables away from the meat for me which was really nice! The vegetables were delicious too, a lot of my fave veggies in that mix! As my meal I ended up just getting a veggie roll. It was very tasty, I haven't had too much veggie sushi before, but I liked this quite a bit! I was surprised at how full I was when I left because it didn't seem like that much food, but I was filled up for sure. I would come back, it's really awesome how long it has been there too!",

    "text": "Deliciousness - 3/5 Happiness - 1/5  It is so disappointing how bad this place is as I love teppanyaki cooking and the show that goes with it. And the food here is just fine. The fried rice is tasty and not greasy. The meats were cooked to perfection, though I could have used a bit more flavoring. And the price is reasonable enough ($30-50 for the teppanyaki options).   But the show was lacking for sure. The cook simply refused to interact with the table, not even answering questions. I am partially paying a premium for the show, and there just wasn't a show to be had. A few flips of cutlery at the beginning and then he had his eyes glued to the grill after that. It also took about 30 minutes from ordering for the cooking to begin, that's a long time to wait.  And then, the payment was a mess. We were a party of four. One of us paid $40, one of us paid $50, and the other two paid over $150.00. Why? We have no idea. The restaurant failed to give a detailed receipt of what could have led to such disparity in the bills, let alone two bills over $150.00. We then discovered that they ran our cards multiple times for differing amounts. And we received no apologies, no explanation, and just brusque answers to why they kept taking our cards. I remain convinced that they charged the entire table to the four of us, even though we were not there with the others dining at the table. When I asked to speak to a manager, they just gave me the restaurant's phone number and said to call back later.   I'd recommend going to a happier place for the experience than Kyoto.",

Many of the rolls are large in size which is normally good but in this case leads to the sushi falling apart when dipping in soy due to the poor technique in rolling them.    Price- It is not as cheap as it should be for the quality but it isn't terrible for sushi prices generally.  The food tastes ok but I find that the poor technique is too much for me to get past when eating sushi.  Fish quality is fine but not the best I have had in Phoenix.  Service- This is by far the worst thing about this restaurant.  NEVER SIT AT THE SUSHI BAR because you will have servers constantly reaching over your shoulders all night (during dinner service at least). The servers should have a place to get food for the tables without having to reach over customers.  This is a total failure of this restaurant design.  I get so angry at the bumping and shoving by the servers at the sushi bar that I will never go back.  Each time I go to give them another shot there aren't any tables and they sit me at the bar.    Go somewhere else to avoid the sub-par, expensive food and terrible service during busy hours.",

Its hidden and the parking can be awful, but its worth it. The bento boxes are perfect for lunch and cheap. I wish that they would come with a cali roll like most.

I've only been there for lunch, and you can't get a better deal.  I would order the #3 lunch special - Chicken Teriyaki & Rice - for $3.50.  Yeah, you read that right...$3.50.  You get chicken, rice, salad, & a few orange wedges - perfect portion for lunch, and it's almost cheaper than bringing your own lunch to work!  The only downside to this place is that if you get there a little after noon for lunch, the service slows WAY down.  I once waited nearly an hour for my food when other times it was out in as little as 10 minutes.  I know places get busy, but they are always busy for lunch, so I'm not sure why they haven't figured that out yet.  They have other items on their lunch menu which includes some sushi, pork, and of couse some more chicken variations.  HIGHLY recommended if you are in Old Town Scottsdale for lunch!",

Service was perfectly fine this time (noticed a few new faces) but to my lament... Our sashimi was warm and mushy. NOT what you want to see! I couldn't even eat it, so gave to my BF. Well, guess who spent the next 24 hrs sitting on the porcelain throne.   Yes, it's AZ and it's hot. But if it's not fit to eat... DON'T SERVE IT!

I happen to be a friend of some guys who have sent their daughters to ASU and everything about that tradition loses all of it's appeal once your age hits 29 or your IQ hits 101.  If Scottsdale can be said to be full of people who either live at Club Med or work for Club Med, Kyoto is their kind of place. Loud, cute, semi-drunk and more impressed with itself than anyone ought to be.  That said, just like most trust fund girls, all the teeth are straight and the diction is perfect. It's all very wholesome and lovely, but something about it just strikes you as a bit too..hmm how shall we say.. brightly colored. If you happen to be a man who has survived any one of the four great tests of American manhood (child custody, IRS trouble, felony conviction or heart attack), then this is the kind of place you should avoid. That is because it is chock full of people whose idea of grave danger is being unable to BS their way out of a DUI ticket. If you frown in here, or order whiskey, they're like \"Dude, what's with him?\"  So my advice to the gentlemen of age and wisdom is to steer clear, if only because you're going to find yourself staring very hard at women young enough to be your (dumbass) daughter, and that's a very icky feeling.   On the other hand, if you answer to 'dude', all I can say is \"Duuuuude!\"",

The entire time our waitress was never there, never refilled our drinks. We finally flagged her down to get a break down of the bill. she came back with the same copy!!! We asked a different person who grabbed her to help us. She came to the table and asked \"do you have a problem with me?\" WTF!!!  We told her  ignoring what she said \" can you just bring us a breakdown of the bill\"  She came back AGAIN, with an un itemized copy!!  I would not have tipped her but on parties of 6+ the add 17% gratuity  Which btw she added 20% without permission.  We were there for so long ad wanted to leave otherwise I would have disputed that tip charge in full.  You dont come up to customers and ask if they have a problem with you!!!  Not only was the food the grossest shit ever, the service can suck my ass!!",

This place has two faces - a simple and incredible value during lunch (4$ tasty lunch bento boxes...are you KIDDING?), and then a full blown, non-corporate teppan-yaki at night.  I definitely tend to notice a difference in the quality of the sushi between lunch and dinner with the latter being preferable.  Dinner options are delicious and great fun, but the amazing dimension Kyoto brings to downtown Scottsdale are its lunch offerings.  Seriously, they're good, and under 5 bucks.  That alone makes it worth the trip!",

    "text": "Went during the day yesterday and was reminded why I don't do that more often. The lunch special was cheap, but shrimp and whitefish lacked the whitefish and was basically just deep fried slices of potato and carrot. The sushi was dogshit and the service was worse.   Getting menus was a chore, the edimame had no salt on it and when I asked for a side of salt, they brought me another shaker of table salt... what kind of place serves edimame and doesn't have sea salt or kosher salt? We drank a lot of saki bombers just to cope with the horrible food and service. Their saki smelled like nailpolish remover, but we couldn't tell when we mixed it with beer... anyway, it got the job done.  Every time I've tried to go here for dinner, they are packed and the wait is an hour. The staff is rude also. Silly me, I'm such an asshole for wanting to eat at your shitty restaurant.  As a sushi joint, this place blows - especially with so many better places within walking distance... including Ra (yes, Ra is better). On the other hand, as a tapanyaki restaurant, this place is pretty good. I suggest making reservations with a large group. It's not the best place for this either, but it's decent and conveniently located.  Kyoto has been around for ages and I've always recommended it to friends. Truth is, this place isn't so special. Never has been. It's possible to go here and have a great time and decent food, but there are more reliable places around.",

It makes me crave tomato fried rice. The scallops were also good, however, I've had better ones at Roka Akor (although the one here is better priced for sure!) My other friends love this place. I think if I come here again, I'd opt to get the Salmon volcano roll -- I hear it is superb!",

First, I called to make a reservation and was told to come at a later time because the restaurant was busy. When we arrived 20 mins earlier, the restaurant was dead. We sat at an 8 person grill with one other couple. The chef came quickly and our food was all prepared in 15 mins. My main complaint concerns the portions of food. I ordered the shrimp dinner and was given 8 tiny shrimp. I was hungry when we left. At other teppanyaki restaurants, the portions are healthy and satisfying. My husband ordered steak and shrimp. The steak was overcooked and he also received 8 shrimp. His portions were acceptable. His meal was $5 more than mine and received twice the amount of food. Moral to this story - order a combo or you'll be hungry and I mean very hungry!!!",

Unfortunately, the sushi selection here is extremely limited. The fish was nice and fresh, although not the best I've had. And there was a strange spice on the white fish that I found quite surprising. Not necessarily bad, but it seemed out of place. The tako salad was quite tasty, although it was absolutely drowned in ponzu sauce, so beware!

We sat at a table for sushi and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table - amazing for 8 pm on a Saturday in old towne.  Unfortunately, they had sold out of the oysters, but the other dishes we'd ordered were fabulous - starting with a seared tuna dish, then softshell crab roll, rainbow roll, and the green mussels. The seared tuna was cooked and cut perfectly - just the right temperature with a peppery \"rub,\" the rolls were a decent size with thick cuts of fish and plenty of flavorful crab, and the mussels were a tad overcooked for my preference but the creamy texture and buttery flavor still made it a winner.   The thing I appreciated most was actually the service - we weren't rushed or hassled, and the food came out a dish at a time, giving us a chance to eat and enjoy before getting our next dish. At other sushi joints, I am constantly feeling rushed while trying to fit all of the dishes on the table (and I'm not what you'd call a slow eater!). This was a happy medium for me. The server confirmed that we were ready for the bill instead of just dropping it off without asking - it's the little details that make a big difference to me.  My only other con was creepy old men leering at us from the bar...but that's what you get in Scottsdale.",

They serve bento boxes (basically a lunch box with rice, your choice of entree, salad and slices of oranges--a healthy dessert!) for $3.75.  If you're feeling like a high roller, you can order the sashimi bento box, and that will set you back a whopping $6.  Who says you can't eat good for cheap?",

But it's decent. The price is excellent (for lunch).  I used to come here often and grab the Bento box and a California Roll with my buddies for lunch and I'd the door having spent just 10 bucks including tax and tip. I'd be full, and ready to coast through the afternoon on a semi-food coma.  It's worth the visit based on the cost.   Now you probably want to know why I don't think this is the best restaurant in the world. Well, this is an OLD place. It hasn't been updated since the NIxon administration...at least it seems that way....but what do I know? I was born during last Carter year.   The Bento Box is $3.75 and you get Teriyaki Chicken w Mushrooms, Rice, a little salad. It's really not bad for the price.  Add a roll for another $3.75 and you got yourself a snazzy cheap little meal.  The restaurant is dark, it kind of smells, but who cares. It's cheap, you'll be in and out of there in no time.  I probably wouldn't go there for dinner.   Peace.",

We had 9 in our group on a Thursday night and we started off with a round of beers at the bar.  It's a nice touch that every beer we ordered came with a small bottle of sake!  The bar is small and we pretty much took up the whole area, which also happens to be right where the front door of the place is.  There are a few teppan tables in the very back of the place, and our group of 9 just barely fit comfortably.  The \"show\" before the cooking started was one of the better ones I've seen(it was the first time I've seen them light a trail of fire around the table and into each of our dinner plates!).  I ordered steak and lobster with fried rice, and it turned out pretty delicious.  One disappointment I had during the cooking process was that the fried rice was not prepared for us on the grill...it came out in bowls straight from the kitchen.    The miso was ok, nothing to write home to mom about.  They do NOT have \"golden shrimp\"(I'm beginning to think no teppan place in Arizona has this).  Bathrooms are small and kind of grungy(1 urinal, 1 stall, 1 sink).",

This is a much better culinary experience by far.  Besides the surprise birthday details we were seated at one of the teppanyaki tables and this not being my first time it was a great experience. There wasn't any showboating by the cook this time but that was fine with me. Had an array of sushi that was all fresh tasting and well proportioned and some excellent sake too.   It might be slightly priced on the high end of things (but I didn't pay for it so I can't say precisely more about it) but a great place to go eat with friends or a loved one.",

    "text": "While I'm a sushi fan, my husband is a sushi FIEND - we made biweekly trips to his favorite haunt in NYC (Monster Sushi) and if he was on his own for dinner, I could always count on him to be there for a bite.  After relocating to Phoenix, he'd been jonesing hardcore for non-commercial, non-fussy sushi in epic proportions served with a smile.  Our trusted source told us that Kyoto was their favorite and we had to indulge.  The mixed views on Yelp made be a tad nervous, but I like to give places an unbiased chance.  Very glad that I did.  The interior of the place is a little strange given the shape of the restaurant and lack of windows, but we made ourselves cozy in a table next to the sushi bar.  I also did not notice a pre-club atmosphere - it was chill the night we went, but maybe it was because we went after work (which is probably on the earlier side for the see and be seens).  No teppan for us that night - it was all about the sushi.  We started with a pleasantly savory miso soup, flavorful seaweed salad and moist, tender tako (octopus) salad.  Next was my favorite dish of the night (and no, not traditional for sushi, but whatever) - a peppered, seared tuna with onion sauce.  Divine!  I could have had three plates of this and called it a day.  Most of the folks in our party ordered rather classic rolls, while I ordered an additional three specialty rolls (Candy Cane, Ichi and Shrimp Tempura - I love to crunch it out).  The rolls were so HUGE we struggled to eat it all.  Keep in mind that those specialty rolls are massive, particularly the Ichi (should have been called Ichi the Killer Roll) which you could barely eat with chopsticks.  I was a mess of dungeoness crab and spicy tuna by the end of the night, but I was happy.  Price was absolutely fair for the quality of the food - there are many (MANY) overprices sushi places in Scottsdale and many dirt cheap places in the valley.  This one charges fairly and keeps the quality up.  I don't ever mind paying if it's worth it.  Will most definitely come back and hopefully take in some teppan next time :)",

Actually, it is under $5.  Serious value!  I love the bento boxes, everything is always fresh.  I usually get the teriaki chicken since I don't like fried so much or sometimes when I feel like a splurge I get the sashimi.  Either way it is always good.",

The sushi was great at a reasonable price off the regular menu. The staff was friendly and laid back yet still attentive which was refreshing.  I loved all the rolls we tried: (in order of favorites) caterpillar, Philadelphia, Salmon volcano (warning it is salt that they light on fire), tuna maki, and another I can't remember. Although the boyfriend is still partial to Roka Akor, I think this is my new favorite location! I definitely cannot wait to come back and please open a location in Glendale!",

Don't get me wrong I love to eat with a group of friends at Kyoto.  But know that the Teppan style cooking is an authentic tourist trap created by a chain restaurant owner in Japan.    The Review  I like the Kyoto bowl for but a good Japanese food.  The chiefs create a great experience and atmosphere and the Sushi is pretty good.  I have eaten here a few times, and have had a saki bomb here or there. I learned the hard way how power full the drinks are so use with caution.",

With that being said, I wouldn't say it's nearly as good as some of the other hibachi restaurants I've tried in other parts of the country, but hey.   We were a party of 6 dining for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night.  For appetizers we started out with Kyoto Sticky Drumettes and Crispy Shrimp Tempura.  The shrimp tempura was lightly fried, lightly seasoned and thankfully, not greasy.  The fried chicken wings were fried nicely but bland.  No salt and pepper at all.  You NEEDED the sauce that accompanied the wings.  I'll pass next time!  Our entrees varied between the 6 of us and I don't remember every dish that every person ordered, although I've tried every single one.  They just weren't that memorable! 2 of us ordered the chicken and shrimp hibachi style. 1 person ordered the Filet Mignon hibachi style. I wouldn't order the chicken and shrimp again.  The chicken was tasteless and dry.  The shrimp was overcooked and definitely frozen. The filet was cooked medium and taste really good.   I ordered 1 cocktail from the bar, again can't remember the name because there was nothing memorable about it.  I chose wine for my second drink because well ...you can't go too wrong with a Malbec.",

They have a LIST of GLUTEN-FREE sushi rolls to pick from!   Note: the California roll says it's gluten-free on the menu but when we asked our waiter, we had to SPECIFICALLY order it to be gluten-free. So instead of being made with crab mix, they use crab pieces!   They also have GLUTEN-FREE SOY SAUCES! You can't have sushi without soy sauce, right? We ordered a gluten-free California roll, a Philadelphia roll, and an Alaskan roll. Our FAVORITE was the Alaskan roll: served with salmon, avocado, and cucumber on the inside with grilled salmon and lemon on top! The sour lemon really added extra depth to the roll and mixed well with the soy sauce!",

You can sit at the bar and play one/two player games and you drink and eat. All the games were strange knock-offs of old schools Nintendo games, but we're fun to play with none the less. I was happily surprised by the ramen, its cheaper than most. You start off with a base of $4 and choose your broth/proteins/toppings from there. While it wasn't the best ramen I've had it was good for the night. We also got delicious plum sangria. It was sweeter then I prefer my alcohol usually but fit with the vibes.",

I did have fond memories of dining at Kyoto over the years... and I wanted to share those with my family.  I recently had the opportunity to take my daughter out to dinner for a little mommy-daughter date, and she agreed to be adventurous and check out the \"restaurant where they cook in front of you.\"    I called ahead and got a reservation... We arrived a few minutes early and sat to find an underwhelming ambiance and pretty lackluster service.  We made the most of it and stayed positive, and we enjoyed our time together and met the other diners seated at our hibachi table, but all things considered, the dinner -- especially the food -- was meh.  While it was fun to watch the food prep, there weren't too many tricks or anything super remarkable besides some fire and smoke... Right off the bat, my daughter's plate broke right in front of us which scared us both a bit.  We didn't even get any apology or explanation for that.  Luckily, my daughter enjoyed the edamame starter I ordered her and I enjoyed our ginger salads... the soups were just okay.  She barely touched her chicken hibachi entree and while I ate my shrimp and veggies, I found them to be way over sauced and nothing special.    It was indeed an experience, but I will not be rushing back anytime soon... sorry Kyoto.",

The building is aged and decor is dated, which takes nothing away from the quality of food, but unfortunately doesn't do much to contribute to the ambience.   The chef's performance was a highlight, he was talkative and efficient and funny, just as we would expect. Unfortunately the food was just different from what we are used to. Fried rice wasn't as buttery and soft, and the veggies were just too \"mixed\". I suppose we may just be guilty of enjoying our southern, buttery, goodness from the Carolinas.   Overall, Kyoto provided us a good dining experience, just not at the top of our \"must dine at again\" list.",

The fries were just OK and the Miso dressing wasn't as flavorful as we would have liked.    However, the Eel and Cucumber roll was good.  My son ordered the Beef Teriyaki and I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki dinners.  The dishes came with a large portion of steamed rice and there were a mound of mushrooms, onions, bell peppers and egg plant under the meat.  At first glance, we thought there wasn't enough food.

I apologized to my son as is wasn't a fun and yummy family dinner together to celebrate his special day.Food was horrible, dry, bland,soggy and the chef at our table was as as exciting as a bucket of hair!! They also said they would sing happy Birthday that wasn't done either.Also this place needs a good cleaning of their windows and decor inside. the vases on each side of the window some had flowers tilting some didn't, Its outdated. Completely a disappointment.",

That said, Kyoto is one of our go-to spots because you can sit at the sushi bar and watch their chefs work their magic + they have an INCREDIBLE happy hour!   ALSO - check in on Yelp for a complimentary Sunomono Salad (cucumber salad). It is a big portion too!   My absolute musts when I come are spicy edamame, miso soup, house salad (I love their ginger dressing), fried rice, and then...the SUSHI! We actually switch up the rolls every time because we like to try new things but last night, we ordered the CRAZY roll and you guys - it was a dream come True! I'm currently obsessed with shishito peppers and this roll was topped with them + they DO NOT skimp on the avocado. Yes, please! We also love the basics like spicy tuna, spicy crab, etc. Also, their fried rice is the best fried rice that i've EVER had. It is SO flavorful and you can order a small side if you don't want the big order. But the big order has chicken, steak, AND shrimp in it. Pretty hard to resist.   Anywho, we'll definitely be back soon! Thank you for always curing our sushi cravings! :)",

Ordered sushi for apps but the waitress said we had to order the tapeakin at the same time to make sure we got it at the right time. Tepenaki came and no sushi. Sushi came as dessert and then before we were done eating, they brought out dessert. I get wanting to rotate tables but give me a break. No water refill unless we asked or drinks.  The service out weighed how good the food was for my friends bday. We were all beyond annoyed. They did try to make up for the lack of EVERYTHING and take 25% off the sushi we ended up taking home anyway and then gave us a free drink at the end of the night.   Not enough for a $600 meal that they tried to scoot us out of in an hour.  Won't be back. However- the Vegas roll was unbelievable!  And the chef at the table was great too.... only reason they are getting 2 stars. The food was 5 stars.",

The man I spoke to on the phone was extremely rude and even acted offended that I was asking. He said they had gluten free soy sauce, but that they didn't really have any gluten free options which I found confusing. Am I supposed to have gf soy sauce on the side of nothing for dinner? He then said that they aren't an American restaurant so they don't have \"the kind of stuff\" to make things gluten free. I understand that not all restaurants are able to accommodate a gluten free menu or gluten free options, but his passive aggressive tone and rudeness were completely unwarranted. I simply inquired. I have also been to dozens of other Japanese restaurants that have gluten free options and much better customer service so I will be taking my business to one of those. Kyoto lost a party of 5 tonight. I hope his bad attitude was worth it to them.",

    "text": "Went here for fathers day with my husband, 3 kids and two other adults. At first we were slightly frustrated because we had a reservation and still had to wait about 20 min, not as easy a task with 3 tiny humans. However, once we were seated they more than made up for it. I asked the hostess for some plain paper and pencils for the kids to draw on and she was more than happy to help out. The other staff brought out little chopstick helpers which the kids were thrilled they could use chopsticks for their food. The chef, which I think is the reason why we had to wait was for him - was TOTALLY worth it. He entertained the kids and even cut up their food \"Mini\" size, which is GREAT when you want to eat and you don't have to spend time cutting up their meat or veggies to smaller pieces. He even gave us some extra fire at the end per the kids request. The staff then brought out little light up heart necklaces for the kids too - which just made the night even more memorable. It was a wonderful dinner and fathers day and was great for the kids who were soooo entertained, we had just a great time.   As for the food - it was great, cooked how we liked it, well seasoned and well priced. The staff was on point making sure we had everything we needed, never ran out of water or drinks - they were extremely accommodating. This place would work for a different night out with adults or definitely if you have kids because they are well entertained. Already planning on taking them again for a fun dinner out.",

I usually like more of a Japanese type feel. Not sure if I'd go again",

It really works because I see every table have several orders of these (multiple by 5 if college students).  This deal is 5 stars alone!  Onto the next important topic: Teppanyaki.  This is the other main attraction at this establishment.  I'd say it's 90% show and 10% taste.  The show is outstanding.  I've been to a few of these teppanyaki restaurants and Kyoto receives the best award for being the most entertaining.  Unfortunately, the food is less desirable.  A medium rare steak is overcooked and without flavor even when sprinkled with their seasoning.  The chicken is dry even with the sauce glazed on top of it.  The scallop and lobster were meh too.  Overall, the $6 sake and teppanyaki showmanship will make a great night with friends.",

Besides the price increasing which is understandable for Scottsdale, their chicken terriyaki entree is completely different. Before it was covered with thick delicious sauce with yummy chunks of mushroom; now it is an almost flavorless watery sauce with a few tiny mushrooms. Their salad was also my favorite, which now tastes different and is served with bitter spring mix instead of the ice berg, that I think goes better with it... I am hoping for other guests they turn up the flavors a little. At $10 I can get a better tasting chicken from RA or Kabuki.",

My chicken also had a bone in it when I was eating it. Then waited for sushi for a hour and a half after being there. Then decide to just cancel the order because it took so long to get the sushi.

Each time since, it has become progressively worse. I'm sorry, but the food has been below mediocre in our most recent visits. For example, on our last visit a week ago, the taste and the texture of some of the sushi rolls was dreadful--like they had been made at some earlier time and had been sitting in a refrigerator for a quite a while. Another roll--one of their specials--just tasted like a gob of mayonnaise. In yet another specialty roll, the shrimp tempura within was stale and tasteless and overdone. Well, we have now given up on this place. To be fair, my rainbow roll was very good, and the sake flight--as well as the fellow who presented and discussed it--was excellent. But overall, this place is much much inferior to the several Japanese restaurants we frequent--in several different states.",

    "text": "Me, wife and daughter came here for my daughters birthday. We called in advance to see if we needed reservations. In which we did so I made a reservation for three letting them now that it was for a birthday. They asked for the birthday girls name and age.  When we arrived we were pleasantly meet by a host and the general manager, I believe his name was Daniel an older gentleman with a cane. He explained to us the parking situation since they had no valet driver but had signs stating only valet parking. After being sat at the end of the table not the middle since there was no one else joining our teppanyaki  table (keep in mine there were only two other tables in the restaurant a three top and a five top both being birth days. The host started off with our drinks and said our server would be with us shortly. After about 15 min. Our server came by to take our order which we ordered the tuna ta taki,edimami and the crazy roll. Once the edimami hit the table we place our order for the teppenaki order for the filet, my strip and scallops and the chicken. Half way through our main meal my wife's sushi roll arrives and I ask to see how long on my tuna tataki was going to be, but she said she forgot to put it in and if I would like her to. I told her that it would be fine since my steak was just about done. The teppanyaki chef was definitely green and still learning which was fine he was still very entertaining and even acknowledged my daughters birth day and was the best part of the meal. The food was ok very very very over priced for what you get compared to other teppanyaki After he was done and we were eating our meals our server was no ware to be found along with the rest of the servers. I ended up walking to the host stand to see if we could get some refills on our drinks and the host was very friendly and proceeded to get our drink order and refills. Our server finely came out from the back 45 min. Later to just drop off the check. The other two tables they came out and sang to the birthday people but did not for my daughter even though they were aware of her birthday.",

    "text": "I went last night as a party of three. First visit for two of us. Three takeaways: food was just okay, filet mignon was not worth it and service was poor. Emphasis on the latter.  Food was what you may expect at a place like this - salty. So you're just bloated after the meal from all the sodium. Not their fault, but just the style of teppanyaki. The filet mignon didn't particularly do it for me, but it is a better piece of meat than the NY Strip so you can make you're own call there.  Service was just really poor. Our reservation was late getting started by about 20 minutes, but I wasn't really all that upset - some patrons take longer than others, I get it. But once we sat down, it took more than ten minutes for a server to come take our drink order. Enough time for the manager to come apologize and introduce her to us. We just got sodas that were never refilled throughout the meal until one of us asked for a refill. I don't think they would have ever noticed and it wasn't as if just one person was coming around. There was the server, two different food runners with water and the manager.  And then the final bit of disappointment was the rice coming out. I was halfway done with my meal before the rice ever made it. The other party at our table received theirs from a food runner and he looked at us and I said \"three steamed,\" he acknowledged and appeared to go in the kitchen to retrieve three orders of white rice. Five more minutes go by and the server comes out to ask if all is going well and I let her know that we still don't have our rice. She goes and retrieves it immediately and once again, the manager comes out to apologize for the service.  I just felt from the beginning that our table in particular may have been an afterthought. I can tell that was observed at least to some degree by the staff with the two apologies from the manager. It might not be that way for everyone as I certainly hope the manager isn't walking around apologizing all evening.  If you're wanting a nice dinner out with friends, you can fare better at other options nearby for the same price point.",

    "text": "So happy this place reopened!  They're under new management and I am l loving the changes that have been implemented.  We took advantage of the hibachi table and our chef, Ivan, was not only professional and pleasant but I couldn't put down my fork.  I was already in deep with a food comma but I just couldn't stop.  I had the chicken and my boyfriend had the lobster, both excellent.  That fried rice though... nom.  We also had a couple of sake flights.  The desert sake flight was my favorite, I didn't even know pear flavored sake existed.  You can't go wrong coming here from the sushi to hibachi you will love the experience.",

The only good thing about this place is at least they brought the check out quickly. No complaints on food but with as much competition as there is in the area I hope this place figures it out before their employees are out of work.",

We ordered drinks from our waitress that seemed as if she was on drugs or just so ditsy because she didn't know the menu or anything about the restaurant or how to talk to customers. Anyway, we waited 15 min before finally asking why our drinks hadn't came. Our waitress was no where to be found the rest of our time at the restaurant. Also, she never brought out our meal we had to grab it ourselves from the sushi bar because nobody cared to wait on us.",

Whether I go to Kyoto for a special occasion and reserve a teppanyaki table, which is always a filling and fun, interactive experience, or grab a saki bomber and some sushi, I always say it's the best restaurant out there. They have a versatile menu, chefs that are approachable - both sushi and teppan have a great attitude and are super fun. Their bar has the BEST prices! One bartender told me that they have not changed their prices since they opened; something like 50 years ago!!! My only complaint is that they aren't open very often - I think their doors normally open around 6pm, and I'm not a senior citizen, but sometimes like to dine earlier :). Parking can be somewhat of a challenge, but it's to be expected in Scottsdale. I LOVE this place!!! Always have and always will!",

Rice was cooked perfectly. The yellowtail had been flown in that morning and it melted in my mouth. The eel sauce balanced the saltiness of the soy. (Note: They even have gluten free tamari.) The ponzu sauce in the seaweed salad was rich with flavor. Not oily. Texture was spot on. Ambiance was a retro 80's Japanese vibe. Don't turn up this little gem. Considering the location, the prices were comparable with other sushi places in the area. Will go back again for sure.",

The previous owner from a year ago did a much better job at running the place. I will never come back.",

Two of the three sushi rolls ordered came out about 20 minutes before the teppanyaki chef, so she had already finished eating both of those by the time the chef came out. The last roll came out as we were finishing eating the teppanyaki. The sushi rolls were all good and the only reason for two stars instead of one. The two of us who ordered teppanyaki both got the filet mignon, both of which were the worst filets we've ever had. The meat was very sour and unpleasant. As others have mentioned, the veggies in the fried rice are frozen and the rice is bland. While the sushi was good, we won't be returning. There are other sushi restaurants in Phoenix and Scottsdale that are more affordable and far better.",

Even something simple like chicken teriyaki and miso soup were not great. Chunky teriyaki chicken, plus big pieces of mushroom in chicken teriyaki and miso soup?! And the sushi and the sashimi were just not that great. What's up with big pieces of sea scallops for baked dynamite scallops?  So glad to be back in LA for yummy Japanese food again!",
