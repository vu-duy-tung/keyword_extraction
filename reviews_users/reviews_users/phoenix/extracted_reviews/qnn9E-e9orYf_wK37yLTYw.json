    "text": "If Sam Fox -- armed with his bevy of outrageously attractive servers, compelling interior design and people-pleasing menu items -- can't make a restaurant work in this spot, then no one can. Blanco is like the 4th or 5th name applied to this strangely dead zone in a really hot location over the last few years.  As has been my experience in about half my visits to FRC (Fox Restaurant Concepts) places, there was a mild service issue. In this case a friend's order was forgotten twice. To be fair, we were seated at the bar on a busy Friday night. The manager comped his meal to make up for it. That was nice.  What wasn't as nice was needing to stare at someone's discarded bowl of guac sitting in front of me just behind the bar for the entire visit. Guess they need more help for busy times.  Otherwise can't complain about much here. It's a Sam Fox take on gringo-Mex. The carne asada tacos were as expected. I'm convinced no one in Phoenix really wants authentic anything when it comes to Mexican, so here you'll be enjoying good-Mex-as-envisioned-by-account-manager-visiting-from-Chicago. And there's really nothing wrong with that.  It's not cheap, but the ingredients are good and nicely arranged.",

    "text": "Five stars for: considerate service.   I have a food sensitivity, to corn. The level of sensitivity has been increasing over the years. At first it exhibited itself in the corn starch of egg drop soup. But as time has passed I find more and more corn associated food items result in producing in me the symptoms of a diabetic attack: heart palpitations, sweats, nausea, some cramps and general malaise.  I arrived at Blanco for happy hour and ordered the guac (nutritious and tasty) and cheese dips. I asked my server and later the deliverer whether there were any alternatives to the corn chips, explaining my allergy. I was advised there was not, so I requested some flour tortillas to be served with my dip and they were.  As I was tearing off pieces of my flour tortilla and spreading it with guac, contentedly munching on my repast...Shane, one of my bartenders, noticed and approached asking in a concerned tone whether my chips had not yet been delivered. I reassured him that I had declined them and explained why.  Shane and Nikki are the bartenders who attended me that evening. They are both satisfactorily attentive and courteous. Additionally, Shane...well he is pleasant to look at.  Shane returned a few moments later to discourse again. He commented that he too has a corn allergy. He asked whether my allergy was severe enough to cause problems eating something fried in the same grease as corn. It is not (yet) and I responded as such.  A few minutes later, I was served a bowl of fried flour tortilla chips.",

    "text": "The best way to describe Blanco Tacos without the risk of insult is to say it is a white boys Mexican restaurant. The food was lacking in flavor and very dry. We started with the Nachos con queso with short ribs, and the meat was tasty, but everything was wrong. There was no sauce on it only black beans, chunks of bland cheese pretending to be crema fresca, and a few cubes of avocados.   Two minutes after the Nachos arrived our entrees were delivered. I ordered the tacos believing if it's in the name of the restaurant they must be good, boy was I wrong. I ordered two traditional carnitas tacos, and one crispy shrimp taco. I had to doctor up both versions by adding tomatillo salsa and limes. The carnitas was very bland and lukewarm. Rubio's had a much better discontinued carnitas taco. The crispy shrimp taco wasn't crispy at all, it tasted like reheated frozen shrimp you buy at a grocery store. It came with pickled onions and Fresno chili, both flavorless. And sadly on the way home the shrimp wanted one last chance at freedom and erupted all over the side of the road.   My boyfriend ordered the Green Chili Pork burrito enchilada style (smothered in green sauce, which oddly enough wasn't even green) he wasn't impressed at all with the overall appearance/taste/experience. Not to mention, the rice is actually a sweet corn rice mix which they failed to list on the menu, and the Charro beans tasted like dirt.   I gave them One last chance to seduce me by ordering the sopapillas with local honey. Sadly, they were dense and stacked like a dessert jenga, so you have to use your fingers to catch them as they topple over with every try.   In my opinion I would bypass this restaurant and go to Filibertos, it's honestly much more of a decent Mexican restaurant then Blancos will ever be.",

Not only is their sitdown service perfect after a day of shopping or for a night out, but they also have a walk-up window that's perfect for a quick lunchtime meal.   During a recent visit, I enjoyed a lovely meal complete with a skinny margarita, housemade guacamole and a combination of three different street tacos. The meal was fabulous and the service was spot on. While we sat in the restaurant I noticed the bar and decided that I will be coming back soon to enjoy a casual drink and snack. I will also be back soon to order lunch of tacos or salad from the walk-up window. Sam Fox has done it again!",

I have thoroughly enjoyed the quesadillas and the cheese crisps. I was going to order the cheese crisp with guacamole tonight until the waitress said that she checked with the chef and the tortillas are not vegetarian.   I wish I would have been told this before I ate animal lard! Thank goodness for this location! Now I just wish I never would have tasted those delicious dishes!   We went for my birthday and the location honored my free dessert coupon from the Fox Restaurant Group but that's it - no cute candle or anything.   The manager did stop by to ask about our meal. I like when the managers stop by. He suggested the corn tortillas that are white like flour tortillas but homemade with lime juice. I'll give those a try next time!",

I could tell the food was microwaved and not freshly prepared. When you're paying $14-$20 a plate you would expect your food to be made from scratch . The waitress made me feel rushed with my order and caused me to forget to order my Burrito enchilada style.  I asked for a side of cilantro and Received 1 teaspoon instead of a quarter cup. The refried beans were not really refried beans they were more like a can of pork and beans out of the cupboard and very bland. The margarita I ordered which was supposedly laced with Grand Marnier I could barely taste. In fact I'm not sure if there was less than one jigger of anything in the drink let alone a lasing of Grand Marnier. The rice tasted like it was your typical butter and salt white rice,The kind mother used to make. But definitely not your typical Mexican rice.  they offer no senior discount, no military discount, and no AAA discount. Boo Hoo... thumbs down for me. They only thing good I ordered today was that bowl of chicken tortilla soup! That I would come back for every day. Did I mention I had a fly flying around and landing on my food?!! I have to add the next day I had diarrhea",

We enjoy all the other Fox Restaurants and were unfortunately very disappointed with the food and experience. The immediate seating on their beautiful patio was pretty much the only good part of our meal. Street tacos were decent but very overpriced for what you get. The black beans had a very funny after taste and the rice was covered in a cream like sauce. It was almost like a risotto, but lacking a lot of flavor. My husband's burrito was okay...but surprisingly small, really small. We also had to wait 25 minutes to get our appetizer Shrimp and Crab Ceviche which was pretty good but a very loose interpretation on a ceviche.  The waitress and hostess made a big deal about pointing out how Blanco is a \"modern\" take on Mexican cuisine. We are always up for trying a new approach to classic favorites, but if you are going to depart that far off you need make sure you execute the flavors. Fox Restaurants hasn't figured this out yet. at Blanco...",

Both of us had to send them back because they were so hard to drink. I understand that they use fresh lime juice to make these, but I'm not kidding when I say I left there with the beginnings of a canker sore in my mouth due to the high acidity of that margarita. And my friend needed alka seltzer after we left from getting an upset stomach. Wish they had wine on their HH, I would have opted for that instead.  On a positive note, they have a great salsa and good atmosphere. The manager did try to help us remedy the margarita issue by getting more agave added, but they were still nearly undrinkable.  I'll Probably go back at some point for a small bite off the HH menu, but will be avoiding the margaritas.",

We absolutely love every FRC restaurant we've been to and are so happy Sam Fox has chosen to build his restaurant empire here in Phoenix. As an example, we were having dinner at Blanco this past Friday and had lingered around until near closing. Two groups of 4 people walked in just a few minutes before closing and were seated with no problem. This may seem simplistic to some but I've seen customers turned away when they come in near the close of the restaurant. This just goes to show the ethics that FRC instilled in their employees to always put the customers first!!!!",

We decided to start with some queso with chorizo because we were starving and awaiting our other colleague and also queso is never a bad call - right?   They don't technically offer their queso with chorizo and their appetizer menu is generally a little complicated, but they were accommodating and willing to answer all our questions.   When asking the waiter what was most popular, they said the tacos, which you can pick individually from their list, so we went with those.   The tacos come with a side of rice and beans both of which lacked flavor. It would be so easy to offer some flavor to the rice and beans - using cilantro or peppers and would definitely take this to the next level.   Overall this spot is really good and has great service. They also apparently have a great party room downstairs.",

    "text": "This was our first time here and I was craving some delicious Mexican food!  The reason for the three stars is twofold. One, because as soon as we walked in we were not greeted by the hostess. We came in on a Sunday evening and it was really slow. When she sat us down she did not engage in any conversation or even look at us. She was actually looking at the other hostess and having a conversation from a distance. She was completely rude. Second, the rice wasn't good at all.  Our server was very nice and attentive so she made up for the first impression we got when coming in. We order the queso blanco to start which is only $3 and delicious! I definitely recommend the queso. The chips and salsa were also delicious! For food, I ordered the grilled shrimp, fried shrimp, and Baja chicken. Both of the shrimp tacos were amazinggg! The Baja chicken was just okay, I've had better at a taco truck. The charro beans were also pretty good and as I said earlier the rice was mediocre.  When we were leaving the hostesses we're still talking to each other and as we were already out the door she said to have a good night. But she already left a bad taste in my mouth, so I didn't even acknowledge her.  This restaurant has a nice ambience and is very clean. For my first impression it was okay and the food was pretty good, but I don't think I'd made the 30 minute or the way drive again. I would come back if it was convenient.",

I recently ate here with a friend, ordered Red Chile Chicken Enchilada plate, and it was so bad, I sent the plate back and declined to order anything else from the kitchen, and I was really hungry. I have only done this a few times, but there is a level of \"awful\" that once approached, everything else is hopeless. The flavors were awful, the enchiladas tasted something like a cross between what was supposed to be jerked chicken, and disguised spoiled meat. I am culinary trained and adore food of many varieties and ethnic cultures, but abhor bad food, and will always warn others so they don't spend good money for a terrible meal.",

The only reason I'm giving three stars is because I couldn't decide between the quesadilla and the mahi tacos so I asked if I could get fish added to my quesadilla and he said it was no problem. Well the quesadilla was like $10 and the tacos were I think around like $13 and I ended up getting charged $9 for adding mahi to my quesadilla! I knew there would be an up-charge but I could have gotten the quesadilla and the fish tacos for that price! I called back later and spoke with a manager and she said that since I paid in cash she couldn't partially refund it but she did say that the next time I come in she would give me free drinks or appetizers! I was not upset with our server or anyone I'm upset at the business for charging that ridiculous amount!",

The appetizers were brought promptly and were delicious. We ordered the Nachos Con Queso Blanco and the Warm Queso which was delicious!  Dinner itself was excellent, portions are plentiful! The atmosphere was great, we sat outside on the patio and there is misters to cool you down.

This restaurant sits on a very busy intersections right off 24th St. & Camelback Rd. in the Biltmore Fashion Park.  I went there on a busy Saturday afternoon for lunch, the restaurant wasn't very full but it was pretty busy.  I ordered Blanco Burger, you can't go wrong with a burger in a Mexican restaurant.  The meat was very tender and moisture, the best part of the burger was the sauce they put in on top of the beef, it has Guacamole, Pico de Gallo & Chipotle Mayo.  It was a little bit hot for my taste but I do enjoy it very much.  The fries were very crispy and fresh as well.  They have a very limited parking spaces here so I had to park somewhere close to the back near the hotel.  Their restaurant has a private dining hall on the basement by the restrooms, it's good if you have a private party and don't want to be bothered by other people.

We had about a dozen people and got served rather quickly. The appetizers were very good. The selection of beers was not great but a lot of Mexican restaurants and bars do not have a ton of beer. Overall, it was a great experience and I would recommend!",

We went to the bar area to watch the NCAA tournament and got there 30 minutes early to get a good seat. 5 minutes into the game the bartender changed the channel to baseball when we had our food and drinks at the table. We talked to the manager and let him know we had gotten there early to watch the game. He said he was sorry but a couple came in to watch the baseball game and he could move us. What??   It was unbelievable. How do you change the channel of the NCAA championship to another channel when 3 customers have been watching the same channel for one hour??   The manager said no and basically said \"too bad\". Needless to say, we won't be back.   Place right next to it is incredible though! Zinburger!",

They have a separate dining room downstairs for private events equipped with AV equipment (microphone and projector. You would need to bring your own laptop). There is also a bar in the dining room. Service was fantastic and very attentive. I would recommend this place for any  Drinks: Pomegranate Margarita  Sooo good!! They have a variety of unique mixes on the menu including a Mango Jalapeno!   Appetizer: Chips and Salsa, Guacamole, and Mexican Street Corn The corn was fantastic! Probably one of my favorites in the valley.  Entree: Roasted Mushroom Tacos I'm usually not a fan of \"roasted\" items, but I really enjoyed these tacos! Unfortunately no option of hard tacos - only soft. Extra bonus points because the meal comes specifically with vegetarian black beans!   Dessert: Brown Sugar Caramel Flan Not many people enjoy flan because of the consistency, but this was perfect! Not too creamy or mushy. Come topped with a delicious homemade cinnamon whip cream.  Needless to say i was STUFFED by dessert. Can't wait to come back!",

Lunch does get busy but we can always get in.  I stick with their chips, salsa and guacamole.  They have fresh chunky guac, and their chips are hot and on the thicker side but light and crispy.  The perfect texture.  I love their crispy shrimp tacos and this time I decided to do the BBQ pork tacos.  Said it was award winning and my goodness I wasn't sure but turns out they are right.  BBQ taco was on point and all of a sudden the crispy shrimp tacos weren't as good as I remembered them to be.   We were stuffed and couldn't finish our food, so we packed it all up.

Obviously it's not 100% authentic but it is still amazing. The food is complex tasting and has genuine flavor. The atmosphere is amazing with great music and awesome employees. I wish they had a uniform besides the converse/vans and somewhat dress clothes with like Jeans. Like an actual uniform for a place of this class, like Taco Bell has a uniform but this place doesn't. That is literally the only thing to complain about though. I had a blackberry margarita and a house margarita. Both were phenomenal, the blackberry one was to die for and I would 10/10 have it again. Possibly the best drink I have had at a restaurant before. It was crazy busy so I think they could be a little more staffed instead of worried about the servers and their tips. It would be better if they would check in more and ask about the food and how it tasted which never really happened. Looked lime they were just rushing to get the minimal amount of work done. They could staff more and I hope the really think about this. But again I can't stress how good the food and drinks were. And I am not saying the service was bad or slow, just minimal. Still would come here again.",

Today we went back after an interesting experience last time at the other one. Of course it was awesome as usual!!! We shared delicious salsa, yummy ceviche and outstanding chicken fajitas! It was perfect. Then to top off the night, Lisa heard about the other location from our server (who we nicely just mentioned we loved this location best) and she even brought out dessert. Wow that's 5 star service! Thank you so much again Lisa! All your severs have been very nice and we're impressed. You sure will see us back!",

The shrimp was cooked great, you get 4 shrimp in each taco and it is topped with a bunch of yummy goodness. These tacos are a bit messy... so if you're on a first date I would avoid them, maybe get a burrito or fajitas! But if you're with friends, dig in!

The street corn appetizer was the most memorable - a mix of creamy, spicy, and well, corny! And it was shucked so you could eat it from a bowl to not get the fingers dirty! I will never pay a visit to Blanco again without ordering the street corn!  We also took advantage of their 25% off discount that I had received via email as part of the Fox Restaurants mailing list, which claimed the 25% off applied to the entire order, but when we got the check, we found out from our server that it only applied to our entrees. It only ended up being $7 more than we expected but we were still disappointed about the misleading offer.  I wrote to the manager about this situation - not requesting money back or anything but just asking for clarification in future such offers. To my surprise, he immediately replied asking for more information to get to the bottom of the situation. After locating our receipt, he apologized, offered to refund my card. Furthermore, he mailed me a $25 gift card for my troubles! It was really no trouble at all, and I never even expected a response from the manager, much less a gift card!  It's this exceptional customer service that makes me respect businesses like Blanco. They really care about the customer. We would have come back anyway, but the gift card gives us a special excuse!",

It's definitely tasty and I recommend adding jalapenos and a side of salsa.   The quesadilla was dry and not very flavorful which is one of the reasons this shy's away from a 5 star review. The other reason is the soda is ridiculously overpriced. Like in the middle of a theme park overpriced. It's obvious the make up the cost from overcharging for soda being as tho how cheap the take out window menu is. It's $3 for a small and $4 for a large (medium sized).",

The happy hour is so so for food, it's a better deal to get the regular entree at least that way you get rice and beans. Margaritas are pretty good and they are not overly salted.  One thing I would say is they could add more of their margaritas to the happy hour list.",

I brought up Joyride as a comparison and she didn't miss a beat: \"You can choose three different here as well, and I guarantee you you're going to like our tacos better!\" She wasn't wrong. I totally savored the variety of my choices (third taco was the grilled avocado), and thought all were so delicious, I didn't regret choosing one over the other.  The flavor pairings are exceptional here, as is the service and the ambiance. We were warmly welcomed by our hostess, who patiently put up with our indecisiveness about whether to sit inside or out, and who put us at a booth right next to the patio as the perfect compromise. Our server Emerald was  friendly, informative and incredibly attentive. Top notch! Definitely recommend!",

The restaurant is very clean and the food will come within 2 hours which is the free parking limit. I ordered the green chili pork enchiladas with black beans and rice. The presentation was interesting as the enchilada came in a skillet but the food was just average. No real flavor on either the beans or the meat. The saving grace was that the enchilada sauce compensated for lack of flavor. The prices are on the higher end.  I do not feel the need to return as I can get a better value for a better price elsewhere.",

I ordered 3 different street tacos, and they were alright, nothing earth-shattering.  Portion size was VERY small, and maybe that is due to it being happy hour.  The price seemed really high given the portion size.  It was like a snack and I expected a bit more even though it was happy hour.  I had to fill up on the dips with chips item on the menu.  With so many places around that serve traditional and fusion street tacos, why bother coming back?",

    "text": "This place could have been great, but I noticed too many flaws while eating here. It takes a great deal to make me actually go on Yelp to complain about a restaurant. First off, it was a quiet Sunday night, on April 24th and we had a party of 7. We were told that they were setting up and \"cleaning\" a table for us. When we were taken to our table it was still dirty, there was a puddle of spilt water on the floor, and chunks of food on the floor that my boyfriend had to step on in order to get to his seat. I was shocked because this restaurant should be of higher class.   Next was the dining experience. We had a female waitress that only made dining at this restaurant even more awkward. She took our drink orders and made me feel judged and belittled for only drinking water and not purchasing an alcoholic beverage on a Sunday night. Next, when I received my order of chipotle shrimp tacos, I immediately noticed that the avocado was bruised and black in some places. Again, I'm spending a decent amount of money for this food. I would expect bruised avocado from filibertos, not this place. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. The waitstaff barely checked on us and almost seemed that because we were in a group that didn't purchase what they preferred, that we didn't matter.   All around, I'm disappointed that this restaurant is considered the same caliber as other Fox restaurants I ate ate North Italia in Kierland earlier that day and had a wonderful experience. I would not go back to Blancos after the experience I had.",

One section was reserved for a large party so I was surprised that we were able to get a table so quick. Inside was pretty packed and there was some live music going on near the entrance.  Our server was very attentive and gave a lot of great suggestions. We ordered a carafe of sangria (red) which was $18. Excellent deal. We probably got about 4 glasses out of it as the ice melted, but it never tasted watered down. Fruity but not too sweet.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas and she ordered the pork burrito. We both had black beans and rice. The enchiladas come flat, in a cast iron skillet. My dish was perfect - saucy, just enough spice, consistent cheese all of the way through. The rice was a little more wet than I prefer but my dinner date enjoyed it. She ordered her burrito enchilada style with green sauce. The only downside was that the pork was a little too salty but she enjoyed it anyway.  Drinks, two entrees, complimentary chips and salsa (awesome salsa, btw) - $45. There is a window near the courtyard for tacos and possibly some other easy options which I want to check out. We'll definitely be back.",

I love the decor and the overall scene but aside from the short rib dishes, I find this place simply lacking in the food department.  Sam Fox usually has the Midas touch but this is on e menu that regularly disappoints.    The popular cheese crisps are unimaginative and shallow with the flavor profiles.  They are basic grocery-store quality flour tortillas with lackluster cheese coverage.  Unfortunately, I have had better at Taco Bell on road trips.  The street tacos are ok.  But for some reason the kitchen insists on dousing the plate with lettuce shred and bowls of can-quality black beans.  Even if the tacos come out flavorful (which is hit or miss on any given day), the execution of the whole plate is simply on par with school lunch lines.  Lastly, the classically solid Sam Fox service has been neglected.  I cant say I have been ignored but additionally, I cant say I have been impressed.  There are simply better restaurants in this class.  Modern Margarita in High Street up north by Desert Ridge is a classic example of one to watch.",

I ordered a few just to be honest with y'all, and each drink was smooth and strong. They have a heavy poor which i dig, plus they have some great chips and salsa   To eat I had the pastor chicken tacos, hmmm I probably would get another type next time, lots of flavor but I should stick to what I know lol.   Oh and this place is clean, employees didn't feel rushed or panicked and has a diverse crowd of ages 17-55 pretty cool to see!   4 STARS",

It all started with the service I got while setting a reservation. The girl was very nice and they called to make sure I was set for the time that I reserved. Then when we got there the server was friendly and helpful while we picked through our drink choices. I definitely recommend this place for a casual sit down while on a date or for a big group like we had. The service was great but the food was even better. I got the three tacos which you are able to mix match which is very nice because there are many good choices. Everything tasted fresh and the drinks were great. We will be back!",

Personally, the side dish of rice that comes with the entrees could quite possibly be the best rice I have ever tasted. Moreover, the servers that have attended to me at Blanco's have all been kind, enthusiastic and knowledgable. If you have a question about the menu, they will have an answer.

I gave it plenty more chances, and I do enjoy their tacos, and being able to order a bunch of different ones to sample. My more recent experiences at the Biltmore location though have left me totally unimpressed. The food is good, but the happy hour margaritas are not strong at all and in my opinion are overpriced. When I stopped a server to ask her about the WiFi, she said she didn't know anything about it and told me to ask the bartender... \"they know that stuff\", was what she said. If she was busy and needed to get to her tables, I would have appreciated if she had been honest. I truly don't believe she didn't know.... but if she didn't she could have asked someone to find out or said she was busy but would find out and get back to me. The bartenders were way more slammed at that time than the restaurant and after my one weak margarita I just decided I would leave and go to taco guild where the food is much better and the drinks during hh are less expensive and way better. I'm done with Blanco. It's not a bad restaurant, just not my vibe- too corporate, and it lacks soul.",

    "text": "Why 5 stars? Because this was easily my favorite meal in Arizona.     ---   ---   ---  I grew up in Houston but have virtually no pride for the area. One of the only things that causes me to include the word \"virtually\" in there is my love for Tex-Mex. My lovely family who still live there are pretty cool too, but it's mainly about the Mexican food.  When I've eaten Mexican food out west, it generally just doesn't have the same vibe to it. Growing up in Texas, I just assumed that Mexican food was like that everywhere, but I've come to love and appreciate the specific art of Tex Mex.   So when I recently visited the Phoenix area, I was curious to dive in and try as much Mexican as possible. My first experience at another restaurant was similar to what I've found in California: tasty, but it didn't quite line up with what I was hoping for. But then I experienced Blanco Tacos.  Is it possible to be different than Tex Mex, but also absolutely hit the spot?   First off, the queso wasn't much different from what you find in Houston - it was amazing. Melted cheese in the form of a dip is almost always at least going to be 4-stars by default, but this was straight up bury-me-in-this-cheese 5-stars.  And then the steak fajitas came. They looked different, smelled different and tasted different than what I've ever seen before, but I absolutely loved them. I really wish I could pinpoint exactly what they added to the meat to get them to taste the way that they did, but it's so hard to pinpoint. Maybe it was just some alternate form of an A-1 steak sauce? I don't really love A-1, so I know it wasn't that, but it was something like it.   I'm not sure I'll ever figure it out, but I do know this - my next trip to the Valley will consist of a visit to Blanco Tacos. That much, I am certain of.",

    "text": "Update: I also took the time to contact customer service at Blanco. I am blown away and so impressed with their excellent customer service and how quickly they responded to me. I was contacted by two managers almost immediately, customer service at Fox Concepts is beyond comparison and truly excellent. They really do care and value customer opinions. I am SO happy to announce they are bringing back the Skillet Style Enchiladas, effective now!!! I have not been back yet to try them again but will be visiting again very soon. Thanks Blanco! So many other restaurants and companies could learn from your lead.   Our server was so nice! We came today during happy hour. I always love going to Blanco, it was one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. We don't have one in Gilbert so I was happy to go to this location l after a doctor appointment. The nachos were great as always and the salsa was super fresh. However, they no longer serve their enchiladas in a mini cast iron skillet like they used to because apparently people were burning themselves. Even after the servers repeatedly telling them, \"be careful it's very hot!\" I wish I could say the short rib enchiladas tasted the same rolled but they were quite disappointing, no cheese and no flavor :/ The short rib enchiladas in the skillet were SO amazing and one of my favorite dishes anywhere, I already miss those! Also the chicken burrito was nothing special and mostly beans. Purposely didn't order a bean burrito but that's what I got anyway. Side note, they do offer Diet Dr. Pepper which is a rarity and also awesome. The floor was also a bit dirty when we got there but it was windy outside t. Again, our server was so great, just a little disappointed with the declining food quality.",

We had the pomegranite/grapefruit margarita, the red chile and poblano cheese crisp which was so flavorful and huge...could have been dinner by itself.  The salad that we shared was so crisp and fresh and that chipotle ranch dressing was divine!  We also tried a couple tortas, and finished off with the churros with real mexican chocolate.  Although the food and service were really really good, Raymond is who made our pre celebration afternoon the very best.  We will request him always!",

The queso is great too ($3 during happy hour), and I always get an entree with their bbq pork in it- my favorite right now is the bbq quesadilla. The quesadilla is big, my husband and I usually share it and we both are full afterward. Add all of this plus unlimited chips and salsa and you've got a great dinner at Blancos.",

    "text": "We were staying over at the Camby and decided to grab some dinner before a movie we were seeing at the Esplanade. The guy at the front desk recommended Blanco. We took the underground walkway over from the hotel.  For a Saturday night the wait wasn't bad at all and we watched the Suns game at the bar til our table was ready.  I didn't get one but I heard three people around me talking about how good the margaritas were. Our waitress was really nice, attentive. The atmosphere was really chill; not too loud, nice lighting and ambiance and the music selection was spot on. (Kudos to whoever picked Walk the Moon \"Avalanche\" )  Everything is made from scratch and our waitress made sure to ask us before we ordered anything if we had any food allergies she should know about. I appreciated that. We said \"no\" and she brought us a bowl (first of a few) of chips and two different kinds of salsa. The salsa was flavorful and not overpowered by heat and the chips were just the right amount of crispy and salty.   We got the combo fajitas to share ($20), carne asada and chicken. The fajitas come with a generous helping and the meet to veg ratio was perfect. It's also had a side of sour cream, pico and guacamole (that wasn't extra). The tortillas were hot and fluffy. I wouldn't recommend sharing if you came really hungry though because the tortillas are delicious but quite small.   Definitely will be coming back to try the tacos and Mexican street corn!",

    "text": "MUST TRY!!! Went in for a friends birthday birthday dinner. They accept reservations for our large party.   It's a nice big restaurant with modern decor and an open kitchen. The bathrooms are located down stairs as well as a separate party room and bar that would be great to rent out for a party.   We got there a little before 6pm to catch happy hour and got half price margaritas. The group got a mix of about every margaritas and all we're really smooth and tasty. The original had a little OJ in it which made it refreshing and I got the mixed berry which was great.   The server had let us know that they make all ingredients in house with fresh ingredients so they can easily accommodate any allergies. Once we received our food I could tell each item had that fresh taste and so much flavor! The chips were warm and they serve them with 3 Salas's: mild green, house medium, and a habanero which I didn't think it was hot but it had that good roasted flavor. The green salsa was my favorite though!   For our meal we went with the 3 taco combos that you can mix and match! I got the green chilli pork and carnitas tacos with rice and sub beans for Mexican street corn ($2 upcharge). My husband got the carne asada tacos. They have fresh made corn or flour tortillas. All the tacos were super amazing! So much flavor and perfect size. We added a little corn and rice to the taco and made it packed full of flavor. My favorite was definitely the green chilli pork, very juicy! And don't get me started with that Mexican street corn.... TO DIE FOR!!!!   Overall everything was amazing! The service was great and very prompt. They even give you a free dessert on your birthday! Our friend choose this chocolate cake that was very rich but tasty and perfect to share. The food was incredible and packed full of flavor. You could taste the freshness of every ingredient. I can't wait to come back and take new friends and family. I highly highly recommend!!! Thank you Blanco Taco! (:",

We started with a carafe of the Blanco sangria, and boy was it good.  Our appetizers were the guacamole and the queso dip. Their chips and their salsa are delicious! Our party ordered the shrimp ceviche, steak and chicken fajitas, and an enchilada machaca burrito. Everything was excellent and everyone was sharing so we could all get a taste.

I understand it was a Friday night but we had little kids with us. The minute we were sat the wait staff was super attentive with chip refills and topping off drinks. I loved all three of their salsas and actually think I prefer the \"hot sauce\" best if you like spicy. I LOVE spicy and it didn't seem that hot. We got two orders of the queso and it tasted unlike any other queso I've had. Omg. What's in that?! It was incredible and velvety smooth. SO GLAD we got two cause we were scraping the skillets clean.  When I had to take my daughter to the bathroom I asked the host where to go. Instead of pointing in the direction of the restrooms he said \"follow me\" and WALKED ME THERE. Amazing customer service. I appreciated that and it doesn't go unnoticed.  They had a fun patio and a big open bar which looked great if you wanted to just stop in for a drink or an appetizer (queso).  I got the short rib enchiladas. Very unique how they're served in a mini skillet. For me personally, the sauce was a little much. I couldn't identify where the tortillas were and it was like swimming in sauce. Not sure if this is the norm but it kinda ruined it for me. I went through and picked out all the chunks of tender meat though and it was 100.  Their rice is to die for. So buttery and flavorful. I'm usually opposed to mexican restaurants who serve white rice (looking st you chipotle) because I love mexican rice so much but I'd take it over their beans even!  Blanco, I'll definitely be back. To try the tacos and eat my weight in queso.",

    "text": "I came for the Blood Orange Margarita (excellent), and just to be sure it was legit, I had two...was tempted to have a third, and thought the wiser since it was Tuesday and a early morning mtg was lurking.  So, to keep the buzz going, and achieving my goal for the evening, I only ate half of my enchilada, which on a normal day would have been finished. It was the green chilli number, with pablano peppers, or something like that; anyway, it was layered like a lasagna, and came in it's own cute little skillet! Good flavor, and the tortillas cooked just right, not soggy or too well done.  Pro tip: only eat half, and consume all the sourcream (it doesn't heat up well) and bring the rest home for lunch and add your own fresh stuff.  Tried eating all the black beans, which were good, however, one can only do so many while catching a buzz on Tequila, and fresh juice and eyeing lovely ladies (oh snap, I knew something was missing). Perhaps I shall return on a Friday night.  I sat at the inside bar, which was a bit too compact (this made for superior efficiency, however), or maybe the TV too big, because I was having to look up at an angle that was non-conducive to my personal preference. The outdoor seating along the bar looked to be at a better distance from the TV, but I decided not to look the part of a social outcast and stayed inside...I know, I should have stayed home if I was going to drink and watch baseball, right?  Cool place to chill during the week, and a bit more happenin' on a Friday night (see comment above), especially now that the evenings are cooling off...Yay!",

    "text": "One of the best burritio I've ever had.  That's high praise, I know.  The short rib meat was fantastic and the burrito construction was just perfect.  It wasn't bursting at the seams but it was well filled and balanced.  Now, your main complaint might be \"Mike - it was $13 for that burrito.\"  I hear you...it is expensive but then again, you probably will eat $8 in chips and salsa before you get that burrito.  Throw in the delicious rice and beans side it comes with and you're getting a fair price.    I've also had the crips (think mexican pizza) and the enchiladas.  Both were very good but I'll be sticking with burritos in the future.  Additionally they have a good happy hour M-F with 1/2 price apps.  The guac is definitely worth ordering.",

    "text": "Came here for happy hour on a Friday afternoon. Glad we went around 4:30ish because it definitely picked up when we're there!  First, their happy hour is really good! 50% off starters and margaritas and well cocktails..now did it make me happy? Not when I got the check...but I'll get to that later.  We ordered the warm queso blanco and cheese quesadilla..(which I thought we ordered the chicken quesadilla...but we'll get to that later too) and a Moscow Mule and Pineapple Daly. We asked our waitress if the Moscow Mule counted as a well cocktail, and she said yes, it'll be 50% off.  The chips and salsa were so good!! The salsa has a spicy kick to it, and got spicier towards the end of the meal. The cheese dip was sooo good too!!! For $1.50?! Yes! Our cheese quesadilla arrived at the same time, and I said, \"I thought we ordered the chicken quesadilla.\" My boyfriend said he ordered the cheese quesadilla, so I was like oh okay. The guy who delivered it (who seems to be the manager/owner?) said, and with a smile, that he would switch it for us because he wanted to make our order right! We were totally fine with the cheese quesadilla though, so we didn't have him change it. Then a little later, he comes back with a side of braised chicken so we can have the best of both worlds! WOW! So nice of him! And glad we tried the quesadilla with the chicken, because it's so good!!!  The place was very nice and lively, and my boyfriend ended up getting 3 moscow mules because he's happppy! Well, then the check came. I noticed that my Pineapple Daly was not on happy hour...my bad because I mistook signature cocktails as well cocktails. In my opinion though, since we ordered everything else from happy hour...our waitress should of mentioned that my drink wasn't 50% off. But in the end, it's my bad. Oh side note, the Pineapple Daly wasn't that good. Can definitely taste the pineapple juice...eh. The Moscow Mules though, were $6 each..we asked the waitress, and she said it's 50% on the well vodka, which makes it $3.75, and there's an upcharge of $2.25 for the ginger beer and other stuff. Like what? The lime juice? Really disappointed in that...does not make sense at all....She said it's 50% well cocktails...not 50% well vodka and then an upcharge of everything else.   Well that was a sad way to end our time there. But anyways...besides that, everything else was enjoyable!! Would definitely go back...this time without any drinks.",

I still craved the blood orange margarita with the sugar rim and the amazing food.   Tonight I made a reservation for 7 people at 7 pm at the Camelback location.  I figured as most restaurants I've been to that we would arrive and be told they would have a table for us soon.   Not the case here; I felt like a celebrity!!   I received a text message from Blanco at 6 pm and then when we arrived at 7, they had a table with a reserved sign on it fully dressed with chips and salsa waiting to greet us.   Well done Blanco!!  I was the only one in the group who had been before and the the food and service certainly earned 6 more fans.",

Salsa for chips needs more flavor. I must say, was a bit disappointed on the food but place is great to relax and have fun.  Moving on to try the other restaurants from Fox concepts.",

    "text": "If a Mexican joint filled with 99% Gabachos was a sign for great Mexican food then Blancos Tacos would be 5 stars.  hahahahaha  No seriously, if you want great ethnic food don't go to the place patronized by the \"White People\" doesn't matter what foreign ethnicity.     Look it is obvious by my name I am Mexican.  I have eaten the great Mexican food from thousands of sources.  From the peasant farm worker's home made nuggets of gold to the top Taquerias in Mexico and So Cal I have eaten it all.   I also can cook anything from the Mexican Culture.  So folks I know my shit.  So I was curious if Blanco Tacos and their 14 dollar overpriced burritos would actually hang with the culinary giants that I have tasted in my life.   Sorry folks, but not even close.  I should have known better considering they sport a variety of pretentious tequilas that no Mexican I know would even drink.  If they wanted to really be hip and in the know, they would have skipped all the bullshit they serve and just go straight to hand crafted small batch Mescal.   But I don't even think Blanco Tacos understands that.  So keep serving your Patron, which was started by a White Dude from the Hair Salon market.  LMFAO  So Carlos cut the BS, what about the food.    Well it was piss poor.   First lets talk basic Pico De Gallo salsa.   I never heard in my life that LIME ZEST is in that salsa.  But it sure tasted like it and kinda ruined it.    They over-season their Carne Asada meat with tons of salt, but under-salt their actual salsas, very weird.   Is the chef actually taste testing this shit?   So the Carne Asada tastes way way way overspiced to boot, but their braised fancy spancy short ribs are under-seasoned and flavorless.  WTF.  Once again, how the fuck do you do this?  Burritos were small with barely any meat.  Wet means brushed with a coating and not actually wet from sauce.  Rice was flavorless and mushy. Man I could go on and on.  I will just sum up the food with one word.  FAIL.    It seemed like the chef was influenced by one place and one place only.  Chipotle.  Another Gabacho treasure to the American people.  So if you blind tasted tested this food against any of the other MILLION Mexican joints in Phoenix that sell food for 1/3 the price, what would be the result?  Come on you really need me to answer this?      One thing I know for sure.  Go and read any of the reviews that raved about this place.  You can be assured those people know JACK SHIT about \"REAL\" Mexican food.  ADIOS",

I just wanted something simple and close to home but I'm so glad he we made the drive over. We got here around 7:30pm Saturday night. I don't believe there was a wait but we went and sat on the patio part of the bar top because it was so nice outside and we are bar people. Our server was super informative and very attentive. I feel like he read my mind the entire time. To start he suggested the BRAISED SHORT RIB & AVOCADO Cheese Crisp, something we were thinking about. This thing was HUGE. I think we could have just split this for dinner. Lots of juice short rib, cheese and avocado. To drink I had the TROPICAL PINEAPPLE Cinnamon Infused Tequila, Pineapple, Mango, Fresh Lime, Pomegranate Drizzle. This was almost pure cinnamon. I didn't taste any of the other flavors noted. Luckily I am a big fan cinnamon and wasn't mad at it. After eating 1/2 of our starter and ended up getting a few tacos. I had the CRISPY SHRIMP: Pickled Onion, Fresno Chile, Guacamole. The shrimp kept its crisp and had a nice flavor and the Pickled onions was the perfect pairing. And their award winning SLOW COOKED BAR-B-Q PORK: Roasted Corn & Tomato Slaw, Pickled Onions, Crema Fresca. A sweet take on pork tacos. Very flavorful and I really enjoyed it.   We had a really great date night with some really great food. I'm excited to come back and try some more tacos.",

The Biltmore location has a private room downstairs for parties. It's a good space - roomy and has a bar. We needed somewhere private with clients. First, the cocktails were excellent. I'm not a margarita drinker in general but this was so well done that I'd definitely drink two next time :). They used premium tequila and fresh lime juice - nothing artificial about it and not too sweet.  Then we had a round of appetizers for the table. They were wonderful generous portions of guacamole, ceviche, chips and salsa. I don't order ceviche often but will definitely go back for this. Frankly, the appetizers were so good that I could have stopped right there.  I got shrimp tacos for dinner. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and they served them on corn tortillas for me - always my preference.  I recognize that this was a private affair and our service was impeccable but I'll go back and check out the after-work margaritas with a side of guac.",

She was quick to help fix a small issue and we very much appreciated it. The review for our waitress Yaneli will be much lower. She was more concerned with chatting with her friends at the booth behind us then helping customers. Thank you Lisa for making our lunch experience fabulous!",

My chicken burrito was to die for.  The salad was out of my taste but when I tried it all I could say was holy cow this salad is great even tho I took a lot of the topping off, funny was the manager said would you like me to make u a new salad. I said. No it's fine . That was great that he saw that I was takeing the top stuff off, but Man U are the whole salad.  Pomegranate margarita awesome I had 2 of them.  Now will I be back here of course I will. When we come for my daughters family weekend for school. Hope to see the same waiter again. Only wish I knew his name. Ugh.   Until next time Arizona.",

    "text": "I stopped by here to meet a buddy for lunch.  Its in a trendy and beautiful space in the Biltmore area.  There are quite a few of good dining options in the area, with Cheesecake factory around the corner, ZinBurger and TruFood in the area.  This place is ok.  Nothing special, but not bad either.  Its a Fox Concept restaurant, so the place is decorated nicely and it's always busy with people walking around, cause there are shopping malls in the area.  The customer service was good, no complaints there, the server constantly filled our drinks and brought out extra salsa's for us.  We ordered our lunch and the food literally came out within 5 minutes.  Very speedy service.  I ordered the short rib burrito with rice and sweet corn and my buddy ordered 3 tacos and beans, with corn on the side.  We both enjoyed our dishes and thought it was flavorful.  We also enjoyed the chips and salsa they they provide with your meal.  Our lunch tab came about to 37 bucks, which is pretty expensive for a mid week lunch.  I thought the prices were a little high for the burrito that I ordered.  Overall, I would give it a 3 star review.  I probably would go again if someone wanted to go, but probably wouldn't go out of my way just to eat here.  Its a very competitive market for Mexican food in the valley and I just don't think Blanco Tacos holds up, especially with their expensive prices.",

It is also really nice that they have a few longer tables they can put together - good option for large parties.  Food is 4 stars for me, some of the items are a bit heavy for my liking, but I do find it cool that they allow you to mix-and-match tacos to try different ones. And I do loooove the (as another reviewer called it) something-in-it rice. :)   Thanks Blanco!",

    "text": "It was a beautiful mild Sunday afternoon at the Biltmore and we were looking for a great spot for lunch. The diverse menu and nice patio drew us in so we decided to try out Blanco.  Blanco is what you'd expect of a Mexican restaurant at the Biltmore: stepped up versions of your typical favorites such as burritos, enchiladas, and tacos of course :). We started with the ceviche ($13). It was presented beautifully with a lot of seafood (lump crab and shrimp) and vegetables in a delightful tangy citrus marinade. There were a lot of very roughly chopped, large chunks of vegetables such as cucumber and celery in it though which made it hard to eat with tortilla chips without cutting them into smaller pieces. The largest piece I saw was a 2 inch section of celery. They definitely like everything large and chunky in that ceviche!  I ordered the chicken mole which had a lovely kaleidoscope of colors on my plate from the earthy colored chicken, reddish Spanish rice, and multicolored vegetables topping the plate. The chicken was tender but there were a few bits of gristle in some bites I took, and the mole sauce was good but very sweet compared to other versions I've tried.  Service was attentive and drinks were refilled as needed. Our total for 4 iced teas, one appetizer and 4 entrees was around $85.  Overall it was a pleasant meal and if I'm in the area its a good option for dining.",

    "text": "Considering Fox Concepts seem to engulf a massive chunk of Biltmore Fashion's restaurant space, it was only a matter of time before we'd finally pay a visit to Blanco Tacos. In short, it's pretty much what I expected. Slightly above average tacos served in a sleekly decorated setting, but not quite good enough to where I feel it's worth a revisit.  We ordered a variety of tacos to sample, including the carne asada, BBQ, carnitas, and roasted chicken. Nothing was really bad, but nothing really stood out as something mind-blowingly delicious. You have the option of either flour or corn tortillas. Both work fine.  As for sides, the butter-infused rice tasted great at first, as most things with butter always do. But after several bites, I had no desire to keep eating. The butter flavor should be more restrained, providing more of a subtle compliment rather than completely dominating the rice. The street corn suffers from a similar issue. The first few bites are the most enjoyable, until you can barely finish the remainder of the dish due to mayonnaise overload. The beans, on the other hand, were a stark contrast, as we couldn't really taste much flavor in them.  For dessert, we tried the Mexican Chocolate Cake. Although I maintain that it would work much better as a sponge texture, it was still decent in its harder form. The subtle hints of cinnamon and salt were both nice additions. With a scoop of ice cream, you can't really complain, although I'll probably forget I even ordered it within a few weeks.    Our server was polite and the service itself was good. No issues with food quality. I'm sure if you're an entry-level taco fan or love margaritas, it'll do just fine for a gathering or date. But in a place like Phoenix that has such a heavy Hispanic culture, there's far too many other options to rely on Blanco as a go-to taco spot.",

Their ceviche used to be the best, chock-full of crab, shrimp and avocado, but they changed the recipe and now it is meh.  Margaritas are average.  I have had to send a couple back for having an off taste.  The music is almost always OBNOXIOUSLY LOUD.  It is impossible to have a conversation here even if you're on the patio.  I don't know what it is that makes restaurateurs think that people want to go out to eat and then sit there all night shouting at each other across the table. Requests to turn the music down are generally greeted with disdain.",

I ordered a margarita and shrimp torta, it was a very flavorful little sandwich and I enjoyed my drink. My husband ordered a beer and the dip trio. Individually the dips are just okay, but combining the salsa and guac, or the bean and queso made a huge difference for flavor. Reasonably priced apps and drinks. Worth a shot if you are in the Biltmore area.",

Blanco Tacos was the perfect place to have this type of meal.  The restaurant is loud and provides high chairs, so the atmosphere is perfect if you have little ones (esp. ones who like to \"talk\" - aka screech - a lot...but I digress...).  Plus, there is a kids menu, along with a good sized \"adults\" menu too.    The food came out promptly, hot and tasty!  Plus, the margaritas helped A LOT with the kid noise ;)  Definitely recommend coming here for some family friendly dining fun!",

Service was excellent, and we hit happy hour, but unfortunately, at this location, I felt that the kitchen was a little lazy. I got my favorite BBQ pulled pork tacos, but they were missing the slaw and onions that take their flavor from delicious to HOLY TACO HEAVEN.   Don't let my review sway you, check this place out. But maybe try one of the other locations? Hopefully management will take this as a heads up, and I'll be able to update my review. Until then, you'll find me in Tucson watching the sunset with the Blanco Mango Jalapeno Margarita (and my tacos done just right).",

My kids don't eat Mexican but they have burgers and fries in the kids menu so that takes care of that (I know, leave them home, right?). Love, love, LOVE the shrimp cheese crisp with grilled corn to start.  The chips and salsa are perfect because my hubbie and I both enjoy it (rarely do we agree on salsa; this has more of a smoky flavor than spicy). And I've now tried every style of street taco and I love them all so I just close my eyes and choose 3 different ones each visit; they never disappoint.  You can mix it up with sweet, smoky and spicy--all great and not too filling. My only complaint is the somewhat high prices and sometimes slow bar service...",

He kept smiles on our faces everytime he stopped at our table.  He gave excellent recommendations and made sure that we were pleased with our meal.  Definetly five star service.    The food was amazing!    The starter of chips and salsa was great!  The chips were fresh and crispy.  Along with the chips came 2 sauces; a regular salsa and a tomatillo.  Normally I am hesitant to eat tomatillo sauces because they are usually watered down, however that wasn't the case here.  The sauce was fresh and full of flavor.  It was so delicious that a few of my coworkers even asked for more to enjoy it with their meal!  For drinks, I went with Raymond's suggestion of the drink of the day; the Cinnamon Vanilla Margarita.  It was very refreshing as it was the perfect blend of vanilla and cinnamon.  I tried the cheese crisp with avocado.  I thought it was going to be small but it was huge.  It was delicious and flavorful with fresh avocado.  If you love avocado, then you need to give this a try.  It will definetly make your day.",

They have a small selection of guacamole, tacos, quesadillas, and snacks.  Very tasty but expensive for the size.  I like the fact they have a cook make it once you order it so it comes out piping hot!  The salsa has a kick made with fresh chilis and ingredients.  My go to is usually 2 chicken tacos and a guacamole.  The quesadilla is straightforward but done properly with the slightly crispy tortilla and evenly melted gooey white cheese.  By far the best thing here is the rotating agua frescas.  The girls at work and I constantly check if they have strawberry agua fresca.  These are made with fresh strained and muddled strawberries and no added sugar.  We have asked so many times if they add sugar and they always insist no.  I've had the raspberry lemon, lime, and peach and they all are True to the fruit.  The people working are usually nice and Greer and Nathan have helped me before with a smile.  The cook even started my order when I stepped up while the window person was away.",

Now that I've moved to AZ I make sure to keep Blanco in my restaurant rotation.  The atmosphere is really fun, perfect for date night. Great design, lighting, and layout. The drinks are good and they actually have some really interesting vegetarian options on the menu. Last month I got mushroom tacos that were fabulous!  Being a 20something who works, I tend to eat later than most people and usually my boyfriend and I just go to the bar. The place is often busy so if you want to go around super time don't be surprised if there is a wait.   Just go, order some guac and a marg and enjoy the setting!",

The fish was super fishy and undercooked. You could smell that extra fishy smell across the table and on them after they had touched it. Thankfully no one got ill.

To be fair, the pork burrito was tasty and would have been much better without the thick, dark red sauce.  The soup had a thick, heavy broth with very little chicken.  Not worth the cost.",

I frequently order the nachos or quesadillas and ask them to add chicken or steak (an extra couple bucks) for a more filling meal. The cooks at the window have a tendency to go crazy with the cheese, so I always ask them to go easy. After you order you can eat your food on the colorful tables outside the window or on the grassy area in the middle of the Biltmore. If you are shopping at the Biltmore, and don't want to spend money and time on a meal, go to the Blanco window! The folks who work at the window are also super nice.  The actual restaurant has a good HH and margaritas. It's conveniently located at the Biltmore, but overall, there are dozens if not hundreds of restaurants in Phoenix with more authentic and flavorful Mexican food. If Fox put half the effort into Blanco's food as they do the restaurant's image, I'd recommend to a friend. I'd probably give the restaurant itself a 2 star, because at least the servers are wonderful and the place is clean.",

She's probably a great friend :)  But, here are my issues:  1. When she first came over to us, she warned us that she just had three tables sit down and it would be \"crazy\".  She was definitely right. 2. We had to ask for water multiple times and didn't receive any until about 20 min after sitting.  It took another 20 min after asking for a refill. 3. She brought over the wrong drink order 4. The wrong appetizer arrived at our table before the two correct appetizers arrived 5. Once we ate all our chips, it took over a HALF HOUR to receive a refill.  We asked two separate servers and a bus boy - it still took 30 min to get chips! 6. We ordered our appetizer after about 30 min (definitely a long time) and it took another 20-25 min before our waitress came back to take our dinner order 7. There was a fruit fly walking around on my taco plate 8.

It was a good crowd for a weekday lunch but they earned some points for accommodating our request for a booth.   They brought us chips and salsa right away, which is always excellent. Unfortunately, there was a miscommunication with our guacamole order, so it came out about 20 minutes after we ordered and about 5 minutes before our lunch entrees were delivered. I was disappointed with the guacamole; it had very little flavor and could have benefited from a healthy dose of salt and lots more cilantro. My meal, though, was excellent. I got the green poblano pork burrito, which had the most tender, moist, and flavorful pork I have ever had. There wasn't much else in the burrito, but that was fine with me. Yes, as another reviewer pointed out, the main flavor of the rice is butter, but it is abated nicely when eaten with the black beans on the side.  The food was inconsistent and the service was only ok. I would probably try another restaurant at this mall before repeating at Blanco, but I would definitely order that pork burrito from there again!",

I contacted management the next day and spoke with the GM Harry, when I came back in he was very nice and fixed it all right away. I ended up having the same waitress as the previous visit (Clara) who was just as nice as the last time. All in all I have no complaints. Mistakes happen, it's all about how you deal with it. I plan to continue going back and would recommend it to anyone.",

Nikki & Christian behind the bar are always welcoming & make the best margaritas. Happy hour here on Friday's are the best because they have live music. Amber was my last server, she was very professional & gave amazing service. Never had a bad experience here & I would recommend this place for a family dinner or just a drink with a friend.

    "text": "Well Fox Group has done it again! It seems anytime these people decide to open a new restaurant it's always exactly right! Fox's latest edition is no exception.  I went there 2 days in a row: once for lunch and then for dinner. This place used to be a Ling and Louis Asian place and wasn't all that good. Fox has reinvented the place into Blanco and am I ever glad! Their cocktails and tequilas menus are extensive and they are not skimpy on the pours. I had a classic margarita on the rocks and it was perfect! For lunch my friend and I chose to share the Mexican street corn to compliment the complimentary warm chips and fresh and zippy salsa that they serve very table. Remember: try not to fill up on chips before your food arrives, the portions are generous! My lunch was 3 street style tacos: grilled fish, green chilli pork and grilled chicken. They have a great tacos selection and allow you to mix and match which is great. They were sered with a choice of beans, black or pinto as well as some creamy white rice which was the epitome of comfort food! All delicious and good value! When my wife and I returned the next evening for dinner, we had the shrimp and crab ceviche along with the Chios and salsa,  we were practically full before the mains arrived as the chips and salsa are irresistible! We each chose the lasagna-style enchiladas which are stacked and baked not rolled. She had the beef while I chose the pork. Both came out gooey and very satisfying served up again with the choice if beans as well as that fantastic I-want-to-rub-it-all-over-my-naked-body creamy rice!! Just remembering that meal makes me want to take a nap which is a sign that me likey a lot! The service is up to the Fox standard of excellent. The Fox servers are always great, though one wonders just how much drilling goes on behind the scenes. I worked for big corporate as a bartender and the training can be pretty intense. It's not so much that they seem to love their jobs as much as they seem terrified to screw up and get fired. In any case one rarely gets less than great service at ANY Fox Group establishment, and I frequent several: The Yard, Arrogant Butcher, Norte, True Food Kitchen, Zin Burger to name a few. I am a huge fan if this company and always take my out of town guests in to at least 2 while they are here.  Muchas Gracias Blanco! I'm so glad I can walk to you from my house!",

Great service, friendly and accommodating. The Margaritas were on point. My son, husband and I all tried the tacos and got the nachos as a appetizer. I would say they were ok. Good but not amazing. The main reason for my 3 star review is the price. I felt like it was just too high. Sunday lunch ran us over $100. I wouldn't say I was disappointed but I could definitely find better for cheaper in the central Phoenix area.  Parking is easy here and they validate for the first hour.",

Certainly not the creamy texture we had the last time at the same restaurant location.  Disappointing!  For some reason the restaurant stopped serving shrimp ceviche and changed it to a shrimp and crab cocktail.  Terrible change!  The crab was hardly noticeable and the red cocktail sauce idea is nothing as good as the lemon and lime mixture of the ceviche.  Management:  Please switch these two items back to what they used to be!  Far better and many times more delicious!",

It is a Fox Restaurant so you know that the quality is going to be good from the the get go. We also get the queso nachos which are fabulous- especially with chicken. I like their carne asada, which normally I'm picky with, especially when comparing to restaurants in Tucson and Globe AZ. Drinks are good, I like the margs, and they usually have a couple local craft options beerwise. This time my fiancee got the chicken fajitas which she wanted because she had a recent vegetable deficiency that she wanted to correct and she wasn't disappointed. Solid food, solid drinks, solid service is the best way to sum it up.",

    "text": "Where to begin... this is a Sam Fox restaurant so automatically you know it's going to delicious!! I always start off w their famous guacamole w their roasted poblano, chiles, caramelized onion and cotija cheese. And automatically you are given fresh chips w salsa as you sit down. I usually get the sparkling sangria which is sparkling wine, brandy, peach and lemon. It's so refreshing and good. If you're not into sangrias then go for their margaritas. The pomegranate/grapefruit or tropical pineapple margaritas are my favorite!! I always try to eat something new whenever I come since they have such a wide selection. If you live enchiladas then definitely try the beef house specialty which has braised short rib in it. It's seriously so hearty and absolutely delicious. Also I get an additional side of their rice. My husband and I are both obsessed w their rice. If you more of a taco person then go for the braised short rib, crispy shrimp and carne asada tacos. And this last time I tried their Mexican chopped salad which has roasted corn, guacamole, black beans, crispy tortilla and I added grilled shrimp. It comes w a creamy chipotle ranch sauce. It did not disappoint.",

Drinks were a good price I think $3-4 for a beer and the mixed drinks were cheap too. There were three different types of tacos to choose from for happy hour; chicken, beef, carnitas. Listen, here me now, DO NOT SLEEP on the beef tacos. SO GOOD.  The chicken tacos were basic and the carnitas were a solid second place. The guac, salsa, and cheese dip were a great appetizer though.   One thing, am I crazy for not wanting cabbage or radish on my tacos? I feel like I see it places and I'm just like, hey can I just have lettuce??? Anyway, solid restaurant. Very happy it's basically across the street from my house. Hopefully I will come back.",

Tasty tacos, cool vibe and close to home - win/win/win in my book.   Service: I've never had bad service here. It can be a little slow when it's busy but that's expected and it's still never \"bad\" or unacceptable.  Food: I always get the warm queso blanco (just simple queso and so delicious... great price, too @ $3. I tried the street corn for the first time and it's definitely not anything to write home about so won't order that again... much better options. I love their salsas- they actually have three different ones (verse and a habanero salsa in addition to the one they bring you when you're seated). For gluten free, they'll fry your chips in a separate fryer. All tacos (with exception of crispy shrimp and bbq pork are gluten free when they're on corn tortillas). I can't pick a favorite taco because I truly love them all. Also, I LOVE the rice... always skip the beans and get all rice for my side!  Drinks: Both the red and white sangria are great... red is my favorite, though. I love the white peach hibiscus margarita! The mango habanero margarita is a little too sweet for me, but still tasty.",

My husband spoke with the GM Harry who was able to find a spot for us on the patio with only a 45 minute wait. He came by to check on us after we were seated as well. Our server Andrea was fantastic. She was patient with us as we asked questions about the menu and everything in our order was accurate and timely. Thank you for another great meal. The ambiance and food were outstanding as usual!",

We were warned that the enchilada was \"stacked\", and I'm ok with that. Actually, the enchilada and how it was served was really good. I liked the small cast iron pan that was perfectly sized to a corn tortilla. The cheese, lots of it and melty too. The sauce, that was where this took a drastic turn for the worse. Enchilada means \"in chili\". The sauce wasn't chili, I'm not sure it was even something like red pepper, maybe more tomato, and sweet not savory. Had this had a more authentic chili sauce on it, it would have been my new favorite and it would have been incredible. I'm probably lucky it didn't because I can still fit through the door.   As for the service, location, atmosphere...those are all good, but I go to a restaurant to eat, not look around.",

His knowledge of the food, recommendations, and bubbly personality made our experience exceptional. I felt like I was at a friends house, he seemed interested in what we were doing and made more than just small talk with us. Sometimes when I eat out I feel rushed and like just another patron, Doug made our entire party feel welcome, brought out everything correctly, promptly, and with much enthusiasm. As far as the food itself, it was to die for! There are Mexican restaurants around every corner in this area, and much of Arizona,  but I would strongly recommend coming here if you want FANTASTIC service, amazing fresh food, and an overall incredible dining experience.

It took (and yes I timed it) 20 minutes before we ordered AND that was AFTER I had to yell at him and wave him down to get his attention. He literally walked by our table 4 times and looked to the tables on his right to help them (it was one table with, what I believe to be, other Blanco employees including a hostess, eating) and never looked to his left (where we were sitting) to help us. I finally had to yell \"Excuse me\" 3 times to get his attention. He came over somewhat befuddled and I said \"Can we order now?\". This should never happen...especially when it's not busy.   Next was the $9 guacamole \"Blanco special\" appetizer. Supposedly it has all these yummy ingredients and is supposed to be sooooo good. I'm about 99% sure it was just a bunch of avocados smooshed into a bowl. It tasted like nothing...just smooshed avocado. Blech.  Next, I got the spare rib (or short rib...can't remember) burrito. I took a bite and I seriously almost puked. It tasted like they'd poured an entire container of salt in it. I asked my fiance to taste it to make sure I wasn't hallucinating. He agreed it was inedible and just crazy salty. They did take it back and offered me something else on the house. I ordered the taco salad. Again, salt...a big salt salad. I didn't even bother complaining or sending it back cuz it was free and I was too grossed out at that point to even contemplate trying something else.   The only 3 good things...#1 The manager came and apologized for the salty burrito. #2 They took my gross food off the bill. #3 The FREE chips they bring you are pretty good.   So, moral of the story? If you go here just get the free chips and salsa. And don't expect to get them very quickly, especially if you have the same server we had. Personally, I'd rather eat at Taco Smell than go to Blanco again.",

We had never been to this place and he made some amazing recommendations. We had the esquites it was a corn dish. It was to die for.

    "text": "Had time for a bite while waiting for an appointment at the apple store so the girlie and I came in here. We both got the house specialty, short rib enchilada. I had the berry mojito and she had some other vodka drink.   The food was amazing! I especially liked the rice, which had a light lime/cilantro flavor. The beans weren't my favorite. The enchilada was really good. It wasn't your standard enchilada you get anyplace, had a little different flavor in the sauce, but I like that. I like variety and appreciate different places making things their own.   Our server was very nice and good. We were in a slight hurry due to our appointment but we told her when we ordered and asked if she could bring boxes and the check along with the food. She might not have liked that, but if she had a problem with it, we certainly couldn't tell.   The only prob were the prices, $50 for lunch for two is a little high, but in hindsight, one meal would have easily fed us both. Next time I want to get the ceviche. Looked fantastic!",

The Mexican faire and handmade drinks are outstanding for a Sam Fox location. However, what really brings me back here is the service, and which always shines brightly. Thank you!!",

Clearly this is not authentic Mexican food, but just because it's not authentic doesn't mean the food can't be tasty. My mother and I will share the fajitas, which is just the perfect size for us to spilt when we aren't super hungry. I love getting the discounted Fox Restaurant gift cards at Costco to eat here.  Their margarita menu is also good. I had the blood orange one and I can't knock it.  It's a great place to meet up with friends over casual conversation.",

    "text": "Saw this place on the way to our favorite- Seasons 52, and we were excited to try it.  The place had a nice feel to it, good crowd inside and out on the patio setting the mood.  Didn't live up to the setup.  The host stand was being held down by what looked to be middle schoolers who were friendly enough but just getting into the workforce and still getting it all figured out...works at Red Lobster but doesn't really match expectations here.  Patio was full so they put us at a table that borders the kitchen. Usually I don't really get bothered by that but  think it was just a little too close cause I felt like we were just short of being in the action - felt like I was back trying to make the adults table as an adolescent. The food- good menu with a lot of options.  Waitress made sure to let us know that the tacos were 'street' type which is supposed to be I guess small but really these things were piled high with ingredients but I'm getting ahead of the review.  The appetizers looked like they were going to be a great start and we picked the Ceviche and the Roasted Corn dishes. Now I'm a bit of a Ceviche connoisseur  so I always apprehensively order this dish knowing it's one of those signature dishes that the sous chef gets to prove to the big man that hiring him was the right decision. Should have used <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FJobbing.com&s=bfe1441615cc124f967e1a2383957929c5e38ed5068cec9824552316a32edcec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jobbing.com</a> instead of Craig's list.  I like a South American version like the one served at Ra.  This is really the Rocky Pointe version you get at a number of places there or a strip buffet.  Didn't really appeal to me.  The tacos came after a really long wait which is unexpected when you order 'Street Tacos' as usually this dish comes fast. We did get the option to mix & match which we did. Fish, Carne Asada, baja chicken were my selections.  As I mentioned, the only thing street about them was the undersized corn tortilla they came on but the three of them filled an oversize plate so don't order these thinking you are saving room for a quick stop at The cheese cake factory on the way out.  Stick with the fish tacos- this was by far the best and on their own were the only real positive part of the dinner and pushed this review to 3 stars. I started with that one and the other two were just filler from there- plenty of it but not all that memorable. Still looking for a good street taco place- going to try Joy Ride next....",

We didn't order anything crazy, queso and margs to start and then 1 entree each. My coworker ordered the mushroom tacos, and there were only 5 or 6 mini chunks of mushroom in each. The mushroom was really more of a garnish and not the taco filling itself. Another coworker didn't get her food, they had to go find it. Checks took forever. We discreetly asked for a surprise birthday dessert for the birthday girl and the waiter took the menu over to her to pick her own dessert, which made it no surprise at all ugh!

    "text": "The service is always very reliable when visiting the Sam Fox concepts. The food is consistent too and although taste and liking can vary it's a descent spot for lunch.  Today I tried the guacamole, the enchiladas with red chile and the borracho beans and rice.   The ancho chili in the enchiladas was definitely not my favorite.  Yes ancho is a very strong pepper but balance is everything with Mexican foods and this one definitely missed the mark.  Then top it with a sour cream and well meh.. Proceed with caution.   The rice is cooked in milk it seems and I'm not a big fan of it. I really would expect a red rice rather than this stove top rice with cilantro, this doesn't make it Mexican.    The borracho beans are the usual pork and beans mix.  I don't mind them actually but the black beans are better.   Lastly the guacamole was okay, not 9 bucks okay as it's mixed in with sour cream and sprinkled with some cotija cheese.   Overall I will keep this place in my lunch options list.  Although the food is not at the caliber I find at a Zin Burger or True Food I can definitely always appreciate good service and friendly staff.",

Yeah they're small as street tacos usually are but they pack a ton of flavor and for the set of 3 they give you in a set, combined with the chips to start your meal, you won't leave hungry. I ordered the carne asada, green chile chicken, and chipotle shrimp tacos. Each one had its own unique zest and flavor. I also ordered guacamole to go with the chips which was a good call as the salsa they provide free is good but the guac is so bomb!  The only reasons I don't give this place 5 stars are twofold: the random fly that would not leave me alone during my entire meal inside the restaurant and the fact that their non-alcoholic beverage list is basically Pepsi products, lemonade, and iced tea. Where the horchata at doe!? That would totally rock if they added some house horchata. Jus sayin! Anyways, if you're in the mood for good quality Mexican food at Biltmore, this is your spot.",

    "text": "My review is not about the food, atmosphere, price, etc - it is about the service, and specifically the service and comment from one particular server/bartender.  I have stopped in here a few times for a margarita/chips etc.  Nothing memorable - hey, it's Mexican Food...it's all pretty good and pretty much the same.  What happened a few weeks ago is the reason for my review.  I'm sitting at the bar one afternoon as the bartender (don't know her name - blonde, I'd say in her late 20's early 30's) is giving me very average service.  No big deal, I'm not really paying much attention.  At the same time she is chatting it up with someone else - another server or customer, I don't really know.  Then, when chatting it up, she says something to the effect - \"yea, I thought that was so 'retarded'\".   As if to say something was really whacky or messed up...I guess...but for some reason she used the word 'retarded' to communicate whatever she was trying to say.  Now...I know some of you reading this review may think I'm being some kind of word police, but 'retarded' is simply not a word to use in any way, and particularly the way she was using it, and especially particularly not when you are serving strangers in a very public setting.    She probably just doesn't understand the hurt this word causes to people who are friends or family of people who were born with a mental disability.  If so, she might better understand that when the word 'retarded' is used to describe something or someone as stupid, messed up, insane, whacky...whatever, none of these things relate to someone who has been born with a mental disability.  They are not stupid, they were born with a disability.  They are not messed up, they were born with a disability.  They are not whacky, they were born with a disability.  They are not insane, they were born with a disability.    'Retarded' is simply not a word to ever be used, by anyone.  Period.",

I had only ate at the Scottsdale location before and have never been so disappointed in the food before. I was so excited to come eat here for our date night, as it had been awhile since I ate their super yummy, melt in your mouth, have to eat every last bit, short rib nachos. I could only eat about 5 chips before I was over it, my husband devoured the rest. However, that is not saying much because he likes and eats EVERYTHING! On to the entree. I had my usual three taco plate, each taco I chose a different one. Short rib, carne asada and bbq pulled pork. With a side of beans and rice. Nothing and I mean NOTHING was edible. The short rib had so much black pepper in it my mouth was burning, carne asada had a burnt flavor, I don't know if it was actually burnt or not because I forgot to mention the place was so dark I could barely see the food. Lastly, the pulled pork, which I had high hopes for was just too salty! Rice had too much lime and the beans were hard and flavorless. I am not sure if the food was so bad because we got there an hour before closing but I do know for sure I will not be going to this location again! Oh and you know how I said that my husband eats anything? Well I couldn't even get him to eat my food so I definitely knew it wasn't just me being picky. The service wasn't great either, our waitress didn't even ask how everything was. It's not like they were busy, there were only 3 other tables and another waitress was there too. I didn't complain because my husband gets very embarrassed when I do so I just sucked it up as a $40 dinner date loss. Im not giving up on Blanco though, at least not the Scottsdale Blanco!",

I haven't had a single thing here that isn't delicious, but their enchiladas are my favorite. I definitely recommend and I look forward to going here time and again!",

    "text": "The only saving grace this place has is the customer service. Our waitress was sweet and tried her best to accommodate our taste buds but the food was just not willing to comply.  Jack N nailed it right on the head. He literally said everything that I had planned to write down for my review.  Like I always say you can always tell the quality of a Mexican food restaurant by the salsa, beans, and rice. What's the first thing they bring out? The traditional salsa and chips. The chips not bad. The salsa TERRIBLE! I should've known with the name Blanco that it was going to be super mild and bland. Seriously the worst salsa I've ever tasted. We tried to add pepper to give it a kick, but no. I even asked for a spicier option and the only other option was their roasted mango salsa, which was about as spicy as the other with our addition of pepper. Ok so it had a kick but not enough to kick it over the satisfactory scale for us. I've had better salsa's from a jar at frys.   We did actually have food and drinks. We ordered the nachos and a couple tacos. The beer was good, the Machaca and Chicken tacos were surprisingly good. The nachos, just like the salsa, lacked flavor spice and ingredients.   Given that it's Snottsdale I'm really not all surprised that they're still in business given their competitive Happy Hour prices in this area, even tho they fear the jalapeno.  So if you're a person who wants to play the Scottsdale uppity role, that can't handle the spice, just looking for some place to drink beer and snack on some decent street sized tacos this place is for you.",

    "text": "I visited this place with my daughter yesterday for lunch around 1 PM.  I was sporting a Nike outfit so definitely not looking professional.  Why am I mentioning this? Read on...  Since we are vegetarians, we asked for substituting meat for black beans and give us gauc for rice since rice has chicken broth.  We mentioned if there's a charge for substitution, let us know.  BTW, this is not uncommon and pretty much all restaurants are used to this type of requests.  The Scottsdale branch is actually very good and the staff there offers vegetarians various options right away.  We chose to go to this branch as it was nearby from where we were yesterday and ignoring one of our friends telling us they didn't have a good service at this location.    Anyway, when the bill arrived, there were charges so we politely asked the waitress about these charges and she said she will be right back.  A few minutes later, her manager showed up and started saying, we don't give anything for free here.  We were in a disbelief as we could not understand what was going on and why he had be humiliate us in front of other guests.  My daughter didn't say a word, but I felt offended.  I asked the manager if he can explain what he was told by the waitress that he had to do this in front of everyone.    Apparently, the message from the waitress to her manager was that we were looking for free stuff!  The worst part, this came from the manager himself!  No wonder this place has pathetic service.  It was insulting.  An ideal manager would have first talked to the customer and provided a simple clarification like, sorry but we charge and that would have been okay.  We almost eat out everyday and definitely know that food is not free!  I had to tell the manager that I have never ever felt so uncomfortable and offended in a restaurant.  The manager didn't do anything to address this.  For our part, we paid the bill in full and even tipped the waitress.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  I guess I did my part by providing the feedback to the manager.  Word of advice for the chain and the manager - please listen to the customer first.  Also, if you judged me based on my clothes and reacted the way you did, shame on you.  Families do not always show up in formal clothes.  Please do not do this to any other customer as they may come there to spend time with their family or discuss business over a good meal.  No matter what the circumstance, people should be treated with respect.  It is not always the food that makes a restaurant memorable, but how the ambiance made a person feel. Overall, I would say I would remember this restaurant for its offensive service and would not recommend it to my coworkers, family, and friends.  UPDATE: I am updating this review based on the follow-up from the manager who actually took time to revert back on the issue and offered a sincere apology with a gift certificate to the chain.  if the issue had not occurred in the first place then I would have given it 5 stars for food and ambiance.  I am also hoping that my next visit to this place leaves me with a better impression.",

Happy hour prices are perfect to quench your thirst with little appetizers to fill your tummy! The chocolate on the churros is nice as well if you like dark chocolate. The only very disappointing factor is if you want to enjoy the tables outside of the bar, there is no table service. A bit odd when you pay all this money for quality food. Would be nice to have table service to make dinner/drinks a more relaxing environment.",

It was a beautiful day and was adjacent to where we planned to hear an outdoor concert by the group Neon.   Blanco Tacos is moderately priced restaurant with a very nice variety of food and beverages.   Unlike your \"typical\" Mexican restaurant this place was not decorated in a Tex-Mex motif.   That said....it was a very nice and a very comfortable place to \"catch-up\" with friends.    We all ended up ordering different taco plates.   Mine was the more traditional hard-shell, ground beef taco.   The ladies had more class and ordered a variety of small, soft-shell tacos.   I don't think anyone was disappointed.   I also thought the chips and salsa were excellent.    We didn't have appetizers, two of us had soft drinks and our total bill was just over $50 before tip.   I'd go back!",

The drinks were the only half decent part of the meal.  The service  was a) Inattentive b) Rushed and c)  arrogant ( one of the servers actually slammed the plate down and ran away without any eye contact. I had wanted to ask for a side of guac - but it took a whole 5 minutes before another server even came by. Then -'AFTER I had ordered the sides, it took another 10 minutes for me to get them. Simply unacceptable.  And the chicken inside my quesadilla ? Burnt and chewy - not edible at all. I left most of it on the table . And asked for the cheque.  Lo and behold - $7 for a side of guac and a $1 for sour cream.  I asked my server 'So sour cream and guac are NOT standard sides with your quesadilla ?'  And got a strong 'No' .   Then, he brought back the bill. And informed me that they had 'removed' the sour cream charge . Lol - a whole dollar off my bill - for something that NO restaurant in the world charges for. Crap -'even chipotle doesn't charge for sour cream!   Anyway - stupid place, stupid service , burnt food, okay drinks and okay interiors. I give them 2 stars - and hope to never see their trendy interior again.",

Fast forward a bit, I packed my leftover burrito (more than half) in the box and left it on the table. When I realized my complete absent mindedness, I went back but the table had been cleared. I found our waitress and she tried her best to find it, which I appreciate but we both knew it was long gone LOL. Anyway, she spoke to a manager, Hannah I believe, and she came over and offered to make me a brand new one because the waitress noticed I wasn't really eating!   I was pleasantly surprised, not just at the burrito but at the quality of service we received because, being honest, service can be scarce sometimes at other places.

    "text": "I dined here solo a couple weeks ago and as Jordan (MOD) was seating me she asked how my day was. I replied honestly and told her that it was actually pretty rough. It can sometimes be awkward when a complete stranger doesn't reply with \"good!\" and gives your their honest answer, especially when there's like a 15 second window to \"chat\" with someone as your seating them at a table. She replied in a compassionate, professional way and checked on me periodically throughout my meal. I was touched by the way that she treated me like an actual human and took the time to get related to me. The food was delicious and my server, Kyle, also read the situation perfectly. I admit that I was in an awkward mood for Kyle to be taking care of me and he always showed up at the perfect time, gauged my pace perfectly and overall just made it as enjoyable of an experience as I could've had. He was there just enough, and also gave me the space I needed. Thank you Kyle and Jordan. You both turned my day around dramatically, just by letting me be where and I was and connecting with me in that space. This is True hospitality if you ask me. :) I look forward to my next visit. Thank you, again!",

    "text": "I love Blanco Tacos! The atmosphere is so fun and inviting while the menu is full of unique, flavorful and creative options. This location is located in the Biltmore Shopping area and has nice outdoor and indoor options for dining. I love the inside because it makes me feel that, although we're in a desert, the beach must be nearby! It's obviously not, but hanging in with tacos, drinks and day-drinking music makes me feel like I've escaped the desert temporarily.   I've been here twice and the service has been fantastic both times. Quick, efficient and very accommodating. I just visited this location today with a group of four and we were seated right away. I usually struggle when debating between tacos, but Blanco let's you mix and match. Not only was I able to order three different tacos but my colleague ordered an enchilada that mixed two of the options available. Instead of ordering the rojo chicken or verde pork, she asked for the verde pork and it was no problem! Seems like a simple request, but I know we appreciated it!  I ordered the taco plate, which included: mahi taco, carnitas and the award winning slow bbq pork. Each had unique flavor and I was surprisingly full afterwards. We also shared queso dip at the table which was very addicting. Overall, I am a fan and am currently craving it as we speak!",

    "text": "Five stars evenly distributed:  1) Italian Blood Orange Margarita: Not too boozy, not too weak. Salt rim and lime on top.  2) Queso blanco: My favorite kind of melted cheese. I would've made this my entree with several baskets of chips. Luckily the group I dined with would've judged, so I ordered a \"real meal\".  3) Fajitas! Hot and steamy, like a meat facial, when they arrived at the table. It would've been good to split the dish... but I didn't. See point #2? I have little self control when queso is in the mix.  4) Good for groups: Having been a server in years past, large groups (8 or more people) are tough, no matter what. Rather than seat our crew of 16+ at one long table, they split us up into two groups of 8-9 each. Made for fast service and more intimate conversation. My water glass was never empty and food came out way faster than I had expected.  5) Location: Biltmore Fashion Park reminds me of the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto -- indoor/outdoor combo, upscale shopping, lush greenery around. Definitely feels upscale even though you are in a mall.  This would be a great spot for work dinners, lady date happy hours, or a spot to take picky parents. I'd be down for any one of these options, as long as queso is involved.",

We started with the ceviche, which included shrimp and crab and was fresh and flavorful.  The chips and salsa was also good.

My daughter had a chicken and avocado cheese crisp, that was a good size and delicious.  We had classic margs, which were sour and delicious.  The service was a little slow, between courses, which is the only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars.",

    "text": "I recently went to Blanco on a Friday evening with my boss. We were immediately seated as it wasn't too busy. We ordered a drink and some guacamole and some queso. Since she had to catch a flight we decided to order everything at once.   I ordered my food and when the server asked which beans I asked which ones have bacon in them, told her I don't eat meat and then took the black beans (no bacon). I then ordered the CHEESE enchiladas. When she repeated the order she said I ordered the chicken enchiladas, I said no, I don't eat meat (again).   My bosses drink came and then the guac and queso. No chips and no drink for me. Our server came by again and said my drink was coming and started to walk away and I said, excuse me... can we get some chips and plates. \"oh yeah\" another 5 minutes later she returned with chips but informed us the plates were still in the dishwasher.   Our food arrived and still no cocktail, I asked her again to check on it. I then tasted my food and thought it tasted funny, I took another bite and asked my boss to do the same, she informed me it was a meat sauce. I flagged down the server and asked her if it was meat and she said I don't know, let me find out. REALLY!! As a side note, I have never had this much trouble at a Fox restaurant, they seem to be completely clued in and know their menu). She came back and apologized and offered me something else. She also said she would tell her manager. Never saw a manager.   I am shocked at the poor service at this restaurant. I enjoy True Food on a regular basis and they are so professional and are very knowledgeable about the menu. I am not sure I will be returning to Blanco.   Perhaps more training is necessary.",

Sam Fox ought to do better. This was a relatively low-cost startup from Fox Restaurant Concepts in a location that has had other belly-up operations. This one is headed same direction, unfortunately.

My girlfriend ordered their watermelon margarita with no chili salt. I ordered the tortilla soup and a burrito. The soup came out cold 20 minutes after I ordered it. And same with the burrito, it came out cold about 30 minutes later. Needless to say my girlfriends cocktail still had not arrived as we thought they forgot about it. When it did arrive about 30 minutes later it came out with the salt. Nearly everything we asked for was not accommodated. What a joke. Terrible experience, terrible service, ok food. Our server needs to take her job more seriously, as this was the sole reason we left. I guarantee that food just sat in the window and nobody ran the drink. Nobody asked us how we were doing, nobody stopped by, we were left to fend for ourselves. Then they just dropped the check off to us? Get it together! I just don't think it gets much worse than this!",

So nice not to have to brave the snow that others around the country are having to deal with. The waitress was very helpful and she gave us some great food suggestions.  Two of us had three tacos each and the third member of the group had a burrito. We were all very pleased with our choices and we all cleaned our plates. I had a Negra Modelo on tap which was perfect.  Our waitress could have been Penelope Cruz's double (well, maybe when PC was a few years younger). She added a little extra zing to the meal! Definitely a fun place for lunch in the sun.",

While the burrito was very tasty, perhaps a bit on the heavy side for lunch, the fresh-looking tacos that were served up at my table for my companions looked sooo yummy. I only ate half of the burrito and learned you want to listen to the recommendations from Penelope!  The chips and salsa were yummy. If you decide to order the burrito (even when Penelope is recommending something else), don't eat all the chips and salsa first, leave room for the main entree.  Plenty of inside and outside seating. We opted for outside as the weather was perfect.  I'll definitely come here again, but I'm listening to Penelope next time! She knows her food.",

For my entree I got 3 tacos: short ribs, pork, and fish.  They were all really tasty!  Came with a side of rice and beans that was just pretty regular.

The meat was actually pretty good (its marinated, and I wasn't disappointed in the flavor profiles at all). The side of guacamole/sour cream/pico was a little stingy.

It is happy hour today, starting at 3pm. They give you complimentary nachos and salsa. Chips are homemade and the salsa is ver good.   It has a balance of flavor and bite. There is a separate menu for the happy hour. I had the sparkling sangria that was recommended by the waiter. When I saw it, I thought it was petite. It was not manly enough for me but it turned out pretty good. I tried the Machaca Beef taco and the Crispy Shrimp po boy torta. The taco at first tasted bland but as you eat it you start to feel the tingling of the habanero salsa hitting you. Just an awesome flavor. The torta on the other hand is more of a sandwich. I didn't feel anything from it. All in all, it is a great place to happen by as you shop or stroll by after coming away from a conference day.",

With a very open and lively interior, the high ceilings made the room feel huge. We decided to get a table outside as it wasn't too hot with the outdoor misters on. While they cooled us down, the misters were set so that our table and seating (and drinks) were getting wetter than what we were willing to tolerate. After a first round of margaritas and taco's, we chose to switch tables in a shaded area away from the misters. By this time, the temperature had cooled off a bit to where it was still tolerable.   Our waitress was very kind, attentive and pleasant. I opted for the margarita and the pink sangria as beverages and tried a portion of the pastor chicken taco and the carnitas taco and was very pleased. For $3 tacos and $5 drinks, this is definitely a nice spot to check out; we'll be back!",

The drinks were delicious and my margarita definitely hit the spot. I got a burrito and it was absolutely  heavenly, I however did not know the square comes right on top of it, so it was more of a fork and knife burrito. I wonder if the sauce could come on the side and I can just eat the burrito as it is meant to be eaten, with my hands. I'll ask for that next time.   The chips and salsa that cocked complementary at every table were definitely appreciated.   Can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "So my friends and I went to Blanco Tacos for a birthday celebration.  I have never been there before and wasn't quite sure what to expect.  The atmosphere was cozy, I would say would probably be a great place for a first date or even just a small group outing which ours was.  We were seated in a booth (party of 5) and it was quite comfortable.  We ordered our drinks and they made sure that they stayed full.  And we ordered our food.  Four of ordered tacos; and one ordered a bowl.  The food was good and even though three of us were ordering keto our waiter made sure that it came out correct for everyone.    So the reason the I am writing this review is because of our waiter, Raymond.  We as a group have gone out to several restaurants and I have to say that Raymond made this experience extremely pleasant.  He had a great sense of humor and even laugh when I did some things that the other four had disagreed on.  He claimed he didn't know Keto so when it was ordered he was like \" o ok this sounds good but I want what's missing\".  We offered him some Keto cake which he had on his break real quick and came back to say it was good,especially with strawberries...making myself think darn why didn't I think of that.    All I am going to say is that if I go back;no correction when I go back.  I'm calling ahead to see if Raymond is working and I am requesting his table.  And I never do that.    Raymond if you read this.  Keep up the awesome work.",

    "text": "Amazing visit to another Fox Concepts restaurant. Decided to use the 25% off for Memorial Day email discount - which is an amazing way to try a new place.   My husband and I love Mexican food and just have not got around to trying this place out.   The indoor seating at the booths had a bit of a draft, so we ended up going with hot entrees.   I ordered the cheese enchilada which was spot on amazingness! If you love melted cheese this dish is a dream come True. I went with the beans (charro) but substituted out the rice for the street corn ($2 more but so worth it). You can choose to substitute out either the rice or the beans.   My husband ordered the tortilla soup which he enjoyed but found spicy. He ordered the street corn appetizer (it's the same size as the side on an entree). We also asked for limes from our waiter which we think is a must for the corn!  Nachos and a red salsa come complimentary to the table which are tasty.   Service was quick and efficient and our waiter was amazing! Be sure to ask for Raymond as we hope we see him next time we are back.",

    "text": "Some friends and I were staying at a resort for a staycation. We decided to do dinner offsite since it was the last night. We took an Uber to Blanco which was all of 5 min and we couldn't have made a better decision for dinner. First allow me to say that our waiter Corey was PHENOMENAL. He was VERY attentive, offered great suggestions and was truly a pleasure. And though we saw that he had quite a few tables, no table's service was left undone, as far as we could see. He even informed us that he's there Thursday night and weekends I think because he works another job. But if by chance you ARE dining at Blanco's on these nights, REQUEST COREY. (Btw, this is not a paid advertisement) lol. He's just that good. I ordered the crispy shrimp tacos that had jalapenos and some sort of slaw. The rice and beans were great as always. The tacos were as well. Believe it or not the tacos are very filling. I wasn't able to eat all of them. I wish I could have because it's not a dish that I wanted to take to go just because reheating would require removing the finishings. Not to mention reheating shrimp  To say the least, we were all pleased with our dishes. The customer service was great. We had no wait and were able to be seated immediately. I'll certainly revisit again, but onlyyyyyy during the nights that Corey works. It's going to be hard to top the quality service that we had.",

The rice does taste a little \"uncle bensey\" but it's still good. I like the service and the chips and salsa is always good. I also like that you can swap green sauce for red or vice versa in dishes and order mixed meat taco plates. So they're good but don't expect a True Mexican food experience.",

We also split a flourless chocolate cake with ice cream, highly recommend it! You'd think it would taste off, but it was lovely and packed with chocolate flavor.   Our server was super nice.

Our server was exceptional asking if we had ever been before and gave us the monthly margarita, prickly pear. Sounded delicious but not on a work day. My dining companion and I decided to share a short rib and avocado quesadilla. After taking our order she brought a small bowl of thick tortilla chips and a mild salsa. The chips were too thick for my liking but they were fresh and the salsa was good. She did bring a couple of others, a verde, a chipotle and another that was supposed to be more spicy. All salsas had good flavor but they were all mild to me.  Quesadilla arrived in about 10 minutes. Picture perfect, griddled to a golden brown. Meat was tender and the pico blend was good. My only complaint is it didn't have much avocado. Small cubed pieces that I only got after every 3rd or 4th bite.  The food wasn't anything spectacular but the service was above average and during the lunch rush quick. A solid dining experience and I would love to go back to try other menu options.",

Then I ordered a taco plate comes with 3 tacos which I picked 3 different ones, the short rib, carne asada, & baja  chicken. It comes with rice and beans I choose the pinto beans it comes with bacon. The best taco is the short rib, it was so flavorful and has abit of a kick. The carne asada was good, it would be my second choice. The baja chicken wasn't that great. Also my brother got the carne asada burrito. My sister got the kids quesadilla. The kids quesadilla was huge.   I was surprised how fast our food came out. It was quick.   I wanted churros for dessert but they only make it during happy hour.   They do have a basement which you can use the stairs or elevator. The bathrooms are in the basement. They also have a party room down stairs.   Love the decor inside. Also they do have a patio to sit outside.   Also you can validate your parking coin here.   They do take reservations.",

    "text": "I've been checking out fox restaurant concepts and Blanco Tacos was one that I have not tried. So naturally, a trip home to Phoenix, I had to at least go to their happy hour.   We came at around 4pm. We were seated immediately and was given waters straight away. Our waiter, William, introduced himself and gave us plety of time to review the menu. We started with a couple of sangrias. William pointed out which ones were more sweeter or more of a classic taste. We were happy that our server was so attentive to all these details.  We got the trio dip that included cheese, bean dip and guacamole. William brought out the salsa and chips straight away.   We had about 2 of the sangrias and then switched to the margaritas. We got the classic as well as the berry flavor. The berry/pomegranate (I think) was a bit too sweet and sour for my taste. William was able to switch it out!   We got too full with all the chips and dip that we never made it to the tacos and main entree!!! I'll have to return to check out all the amazing options on their menu.   The layout of the restaurant was also very inviting. It seems they have a private section downstairs for parties. Bathrooms were also down stairs.   I'll be sure to return. If you check out Blancos, ask for Wlliam. His service and friendliness is pretty awesome!   Thank you!",

We were seated immediately and not only was the hostess pleasant, but our server, Alexa, was quite friendly and helpful too. I ordered a seasonal margarita with pineapple and jalapeno which was divine.  Chips and salsa were on our table in no time. As for our lunch, I had the grilled avocado tacos...really there are no words- they are so good! My lunch mates had the red chili chicken tacos and a chicken bowl and there were no complaints at our table. Everything came out in a timely manner and tasted fantastic. The three of us ate and had three drinks for just over $60.00.  And it was worth it!",

(I should really consider purchasing Claritan to remedy all of this coughing)  Doling out modern flares from the uppity Biltmore Fashion Park........with more tequilas and beer on tap than I'd have been willing to count, this colorful, modern contemporary space encompasses rustic elements throughout, alongside spacious bars and a wrap around patio that my counterparts from out of state simply couldn't pass up.  .......110+ degrees outside......       \"Why not sit OUTSIDE ON THE PATIO???\"  O__o  Ahhh, white people, GOTTA' LOVE YA'! Heatstroke just does NOT serve as an option to you guys, does it??!

HeLLLooo......and GOOD-BYE!  In addition to a short wait time and nominal provender (the salsa/queso blanco sampler, street tacos, burritos and fajitas were all pretty decent), CUSTOMER SERVICE here was STELLAR and despite temps soaring higher than a giraffe's cooch, somehow ...... SOMEWAY, we still managed to receive our meals on time.   Another plus. ^  Sadly this place doesn't exist within So Cal rendering it upon my fave 5's as a newfound noshery to visit when traveling back this way to good ole' \"Apache Junction\".  Blanco....

I've tried this place 3 times now, trying to give it a fair chance, but I just don't have anything nice to say about it.  They obviously aren't familiar with cooking Mexican cuisine because I got no hints of herbs and spices typically used.  Everything is over-salted to make up for the bland food.  I walked away each time with a throbbing headache from the mass amounts of salt I consumed.  I think that because this place is sandwiched within the Biltmore shopping center, people think the place is good.  But trust me, you're better off saving your money and finding somewhere better to eat.",

Furthermore,  manager Marlo stopped by to check on us and provided amazing customer service. On our second visit, we asked for Dyana and not only did she remember our names she remembered our order from our first visit. Marlo stopped by again, and without missing a step continued off from where we'd left off a week prior. Food was amazing both times and everything was clean and spotless. Bathrooms are downstairs, limiting bathroom traffic where you're eating and they were super clean! I would recommend this location to anyone, any time.

When came in on a late sunday afternoon, it was fairly slow. We told the hostess that we'd like to sit on the patio and she happily obliged. She took us out and tried to seat us directly next to a couple that seemed to be deep in conversation and enjoying each other. The seating on the patio is pretty tight, but the whole damned thing was empty! Why would you seat us right next to the only people on the patio? My boyfriend laughed a bit and asked if we could grab a table that was not on top of theirs. The hostess got a bit of an attitude and seated up a couple rows down. I've also experienced attitude from their bar as well. I was rushed to place my order, rushed to order a drink, and rushed to pay, with not even a glimmer of positivity or a smile from anyone working the bar. It was so awkward! The food is pretty good, menu isn't very large. Drinks center around tequila. Their margs are pre-mixed and varied, their not totally terrible. I probably won't be visiting again. There are much better options in that shopping center.",

Normally we dine at their Scottsdale location and we miss Kelly Courson their Manager who moved to their newer Henry's restaurant.  The one thing we do notice at most of Sam's restaurants is that the Chef's seem to have different spins on their standard dishes.  Hence there can be disappointments and we have shared this at TFK in the past.  So of course there was a misunderstanding on a salad prep.  Marlo the Manager came over and could not have been more gracious about it all.    This while she was scratching her head why their Fish Salad comes as a chopped salad and the chopped salad does not.  Go figure!  Yet here is where Fox outshines most any other eatery here.  Their ability to attract talent and get these people into management positions is stellar.  Marlo was so earnest and  genuine in her TLC with us.  Outstanding !!!!  So yes there are some discrepancies, yet when the rubber meets the road, the Fox people are the BEST!!!",

We had been to the Blanco on Scottsdale road on a few previous occasions, but decided to venture to this location instead, to see if the experience would be any different.  My husband, baby daughter, and I arrived around 530 and the place was busy, but not yet packed. We were seated immediately and greeted by our waiter, Nathan.  To begin, we ordered a pitcher of White wine Sangria and a Chicken Quesadilla appetizer. Our waiter came back a little while later with our drinks and a basket of complimentary chips and salsa.  After about 25 minutes or so, the manager and our waiter came back to apologize for the wait on our appetizer and promised it would be out soon. A couple of minutes later our Quesadilla came out and about two minutes after, our dinners arrived as well.  The manager (I can't recall her name, but she was very, very nice) apologized profusely and offered to take our appetizer off of the bill.    My husband and I had both ordered the House Specialty (Shortrib) enchiladas- it's what we order every time we go. A few bites in, I noticed that my rice was quite mooshy.  I had intended to just eat around it, but my husband decided to mention it to our waiter, when he came back to check on us. A few minutes later, the manager arrived with a new side of rice and again apologized.  Our waiter then came back and stated that we would be receiving a free dessert for the inconvenience.  All in all, although there were a few minor hiccups, we would definitely come back because the degree of customer service that they provided was really commendable. Our server, Nathan, was fantastic and so too was the manager who came by to check on us.    Thank you for helping to make a horrible day/ work week better!",

    "text": "I have no idea why this place has so many stars. I wish I would of just ate at amc espenade now. First, it took so long to have our waiter greet us and get our drink orders. This was my first time here, my friends had been at the original Blanco several times.  They were craving the nachos.  Now typically when a menu item has been changed either your server will tell you or the menu will state the change.  Neither happened in this situation.  My friends didn't like the taste of the nachos and they specifically asked for no cream on them.  It came with cream on the bottom and both girls are lactose intolerant.  This ruined the dinner. The nachos were sent back and my friends had upset stomachs the rest of the night.  My meal was the short rib tacos.  These were actually good but this is AZ and good tacos are expected anywhere.  They claimed I was getting borracho beans. These beans were just refried and not smashed all the way.  I will not be reccomending this place and to have a restaurant in such a nice location you have to really step up your game Blanco",

They brought a large bowl of chips with sufficient sauce.   The tacos looked good and the skillet enchilada was very unique, and had not seen enchiladas served like this anywhere else.  I personally like enchiladas and this skillet version looked fabulous but did not deliver on taste, serving size (small) and even though we ordered chicken enchilada there was hardly any chicken.   I see other reviews where people like this unique dish, so I recommend you try it and see for yourself.  Overall a nice restaurant.",

There is a very nice manager ( his name is Daniel ) that was so helpful and he stopped by to check on us a couple of times...it seemed like the wait staff enjoyed working with him and the place was high energy and fun !",

The only caveat is this is part of that Sam Fox empire, the restaurant king of Phoenix, so if you don't feel like greasing his already deep pockets (14 places or so), head elsewhere.",

    "text": "Dined here tonight for the first time. Average to say the least.  It's not that the food is bad ; it's just safe, predictable, run of the mill food in a nice atmosphere. Its very over priced for the quality of food you get. In a nutshell  it's a Fox Concept Restaurant. If you are looking for a taste bud experience you are not going to find it here.  Would I dine here again? Yes , I would (if invited by friends)  but my expectations would be as if I was dining at Denny's or an IHOP that way I would not feel disappointed in the quality of the food experience.",

    "text": "I cannot believe that I have not reviewed this place yet!  Okay, so it can get a little busy but it's worth the wait!  They have very, very good guacamole and chips. It's different from Barrio guac, and I actually like it better. I do wish they offered a half order of it though because it is so much guac. It's usually just 2 of us, so I'm sure if you have a larger party, it's a good amount. I am an enchilada addict and I am about to say something never uttered before: this place has the absolute best chicken enchiladas I have EVER had. They come in a little cast iron skillet with cheese and sour cream on top. So amazing. I will ask to go there on my bday this year. We got the market corn last time and were not fans, but people seem to like it.  I had a Cuban classic (mojito) last time and it was also delicious!  This place can get a little expensive but between the drinks, guac and sharing the chicken enchiladas, we get plenty for under $60.  I wish they would open one in Tempe or Chandler so I didn't have to drive so far but this place + a movie at the esplanade across the street is a good date combo.",

I went on a Friday night, and it seemed pretty busy, but we were able to get a seat on the patio very quickly (the patio was great for people watching!).  Our server was very attentive. He brought drinks, chips and salsa right away. The chips and salsa are amazing - the chips were very fresh and had a nice dash of salt, the salsa was a nice consistency and just a little spicy.  I normally order the slow cooked barb-b-q pork taco ... you MUST try these. The pork is tender and sweet, there are pickled onions that add a nice tang, mmm! This time I tried the Mexican chopped salad - it was pretty good, and a very large portion. To be honest though, I will probably stick to the amazing tacos the next time I'm here.",

The food was off the hook, we had fajitas, I had steak and shrimp and my honey had chicken and shrimp. Fresh homemade chips and an array of salsas, habanero being our favorite. They gave you such a generous portion of food, couldn't eat it all. We highly recommend Blanco for a pleasurable dining experience in fact next time we come from California we will definitely come back as It is Now one of our favorite restaurants in Phoenix.",

Our waiter, Richard, knew exactly what to recommend and made our first experience a unique one for sure. We ordered a braised rib/avocado cheese crisp, green chili pork enchiladas, sopapillas, flan, guacamole and the seasonal vanilla cinnamon margaritas and nothing was less than excellent. Andre genuinely cared about our experience being a great one as well. He seemed to be very connected to the guests and his team. Considering the newness of this location, I'm quite impressed as they perform as if they've been here forever. Even the staff that was not immediately responsible for our table was smiling and checking our table.   I recommend ordering both the flan and the sopapillas and dipping the spoonful of flan into the sopapilla honey. Yummy! Maybe they could serve with local honey drizzled over the flan.   The pricing was very reasonable as well. I would have expected to pay more. Don't get any ideas though.   I would highly recommend this restaurant. Thank you, Blanco! We will be back for sure.",

    "text": "Blanco has been one of my favorite Mexican inspired restaurants for as long as I can remember. I am absolutely obsessed with their queso and guacamole! You can't beat their happy hour either- most of their margaritas are on special and the starter trio of guacamole/queso/salsa is only $3!!! A note: this location also has my favorite tequila, Casamigos, on tap! Yum! Anywhoooo- this review is specifically about my lunch visit today. Two of us were promptly sat on the patio to enjoy the nice weather, and had the absolute pleasure of being served by Sergio! My guest loves their spicy salsa (doesn't usually come when they set down chips and salsa to start you off) and right after Sergio brought us our drinks, without even having to ask he brought out their mild green salsa AND the spicy habanero one for us to \"try out\" and enjoy! I was blown away simply because it was an extra gesture to go out of the way for our meal, and out of all the times I have dined at Blanco (about 700 times lol) no one has ever done this. After filling up on some chips, we decided we weren't super hungry, but each wanted to order about two tacos. Sergio told us this was possible because we were able to order ala carte, which again, no one had ever let me know before! (I've always just ordered the taco plates with three of the same tacos on it) I wanted flour tortillas- the other person I was dining with wanted corn. Sergio said it was no problem to do that! COOL. We both also got two sides along with our taco plates which was awesome that we didn't have to share only one order of their yummy rice! :) Overall this was the best service I have ever had at Blanco, out of either location I have been to (the Borgata/the Biltmore) and I am so appreciative of Sergio, his awesome attitude and his timely catering to us to make our experience so wonderful. The next time I come in (probably in a few days- I can't get enough) I will be asking for Sergio to take care of me again. Muchas Gracias, Sergio! :)",

My bartender,  Travis, was extremely knowledgeable about the product and I was able to try tequila in a way I never had before.  The service was outstanding, the tequila was outstanding and the overall experience was great.  The reason I am giving this place two stars is because of the experience I just left there with.  I don't even know the name of my bartender because he didn't introduce himself.  When I asked him for the $20 tequila that I had the first night I went he told me that \"oh we don't even have that, I know it's on the menu but it's at [a different place]\"  I was ordering an ultra, top shelf tequila, and he offered instead a patron. .. standard drunk college tequila. I asked again.  Are you sure you don't have the El Tesoro \"paradiso\".  He eventually found it.  Long story short.  I sat at the bar with an empty beer and an empty tequila after only one glass of each, ready to spend money, disappointed that my last night in Phoenix was hosted by a bartender who was too interested in the cute girl next to me (not that I blame him too much but she worked there) I left un attended to and disappointed in a restaurant that I thought was a real diamond in the rough.",

And wait. And wait some more. Finally a very nice man came to our table and apologized that we had not been served. Shortly after, our waiter arrived and put in our order as quickly as possible. It ended up being a perfect storm, the main dishes arrived before the apps, the meals came with the items we asked to be removed in them etc.. But the awesome thing is that although the wait and meal didn't go as planned, we had 4 different people check up on us and make sure that everything was being resolved. The real testament of a quality company is not how the act during easy times, but how the respond during difficult. The staff at Blancos could NOT have been friendlier and hardworking. Not only did they provide free appetizers and drinks, they also paid for our whole meal at the end of the night. Long story long, we left feeling great. We will be back, and more often than even before! Thank you Blancos for your excellent customer service and amazing food.",

    "text": "Short Version: If I had to rate FRC restaurants, this one would fall somewhere in the middle. It's good, not great. Nothing unique. We got the Beef \"House Specialty\" Enchiladas and the Crispy Shrimp Tacos and it was good. If you're deciding between these two, I'd go with the Crispy Shrimp Tacos.   Long Version: My wife and I came here for lunch the Friday after Christmas and it was one of the only places that wasn't completely packed. We hadn't been to a Blanco in a very long time over at The Borgata, which I'm not even sure it's there anymore. We decided to try it again despite not remembering if we liked it or not the first couple times we had gone.   The menu appeared to be the same, and I only remember that because it's a pretty typical Mexican restaurant. I'd compare it to a Fuego Tacos but with nicer and cleaner decor. The decor is what you'd expect from a Fox restaurant. The service was good and attentive.   We were served chips that were really salty and I like salty so I know that means they were overly salty. Not sure if that's a consistent thing or not.   I ordered the Beef \"House Special\" Enchiladas which came out very hot (not a bad thing) in their cast iron pot. Along with it came the Charro Beans and some rice. The enchiladas were stuffed with cheese, ancho chiles and short ribs. The Charro Beans were pinto beans with bacon pieces. My favorite part was the rice. Not sure what's in them, but it's kind of like a sticky rice with some herb seasoning. My wife got the Crispy Shrimp Tacos which also came with the side of rice but she got the black beans instead. I think I liked her tacos more than my echiladas. It's definitely the lighter choice.  All that said, Blanco is nothing special. It's not bad and it's not awesome. Very middle of the road to me. There are other placed I'd like to go before coming back to Blanco. Maybe I'm just annoyed because I have to be at work today so I'm writing a grumpy-town review, but there's just nothing great to say about the lunch I just had. Nothing terrible to say either.   I just thought of a good way to describe it: As I was at the half way point of my Enchiladas and wasn't hungry anymore, but also not full anymore, I decided just to stop eating. That is to say, if a meal is good, I'll keep eating until I'm disgusted with myself and if it's bad, I wouldn't have made it to the halfway mark. This is probably how a healthy human being should eat anyways. Maybe this place is good for me after all.",

I brought home another carnitas taco for myself, a steak and chicken for my husband and the green chili queso for him too. My husband balked at reheated tacos and did a full on snort at the idea of a chicken taco (silly man doesn't eat pork). It took him 2 days to try the tacos. He loved everything! Even the chicken one!  It's Friday night, we live in SE Gilbert....guess where he wants to go for dinner tonight.  That's right...Blancos Tacos!  Tonight we will be driving approx 30 miles for a taco. A. TACO!  It's that good!  You REALLY need to open one in the Gilbert Heritage District. REALLY!!",

    "text": "So, for all the foods it appears they use white cheeses.  I saw photos of the cheese crisps and they looked delicious. But, I wanted yellow (cheddar) cheese. So I inquired if it could be made with cheddar/yellow cheese.  If they could not, I said I would be fine with the white cheese.    So the crisp comes out, avocado and cheese, and it has yellow cheddar cheese!  Later, the manager came by and said they had to specially get the cheese.  I told her thank you very much, because I love the traditional yellow cheese cheese crisps, and this one was fantastic.  My friend who gets filled up quickly even had a few slices of it and liked it.  It was so crisp that after I ate my meal, the crisp was still crisp. Perfectly made.  For my meal I got a burrito, but with mahi mahi in it (which was not on the menu).  It did cost a bit more, $14 + $3.  I don't think I will get it again, as it was not filled as I had expected, but was probably a fair amount of fish for the price, or close thereof.  I think I'll get the tacos mahi mahi next time, or maybe try enchiladas. They look good.  Server was very nice and efficient.  Thanks for the cheese!!! :D",

    "text": "A friend and I visited on Tuesday (cause taco Tuesday, you gotta have tacos) and left feeling completely underwhelmed and agreed walking out the door, \"yeah, never going back to that place.\"   Our server was a woman who could not be bothered. Water was empty the entire meal. When we asked \"which tacos are your favorite?\" she answered, \"I don't know they're all good.\"   We ordered tacos and a classic margarita on the rocks with salt, and it arrived with no salt. No big deal, but she never came back to check on us after dropping the drink (like, literally set the drink on the table and kept walking). A food runner brought over our tacos, and our never did a quality check.   The carne asada tacos were oddly sweet and the smallest things I've ever seen. They were fine tacos, not my favorite... but for a $50 bill for TACOS and a margarita... whaaaaat.   The server came back to the table after we were mostly finished with our meal and dropped off the check. Did not ask how the food was. We fully intended to order a side of guacamole and another margarita and hang out for a bit, but at that point felt like it was done.  On the way out of the restaurant, the girl at the host stand looked directly at us and turned her back to to continue wiping down menus. It was not busy. The least she could have said was \"thanks guys,\" or \"have a good one.\"   10/10 would never return to this restaurant. Go up the street into Old Town and get some tacos from the hole in the wall place on Saddlebag. Some of them barely speak English yet service is 90 times better than what we received from this girl.",

    "text": "My wife and I have been looking for a some good Mexican/TexMex food since we moved to Phoenix. Finally found a good place!!  The shopping area this place is in is very nice.  Valet parking for $7 which I found to be reasonable. The hostesses were very friendly when we walked up and welcomed us. We were seated right away. The waiter was amazing the whole time.  He first showed us the happy hour menu and the good deals they had during Happy Hour. I went with the house margarita on the rocks and my wife had the mixed berry margarita on the rocks for $5 each.  I really liked the house margarita because they use fresh lime juice and no mixes. My wife loved her margarita. We also tried the dip plate for $3 during Happy Hour. It was beans, guacamole and queso. It was a nice starter.  Not the best queso I've had but better than all the other places I've tried so far in Phoenix. We didn't know and I guess the waiter wasn't paying attention to the time. Happy hour had already ended when we ordered. He said it was his fault and those drinks and appetizer were for the happy hour price.  That was very nice of him. I went on to order the Carna Asada burrito with jalapenos and my wife got three street tacos, Carnitas, bbq Pork and chipotle shrimp. Her favorite was the chipotle shrimp. She subbed rice for street corn and thought it was good too. I got the black beens and rice.  Loved the rice. The beans were ok. They didn't skimp on the jalapenos. My burrito was loaded with jalapenos and steak. Tasted great and spicy! I also tried the jalapeno infused tequila margarita.  One of the  Best spicy margarita I've had. For being upscale the prices were responsible. Our total was $85 for 3 rounds of margaritas, the app and our dinners. The bathrooms are down stairs. The do have an elevator if needed. The bathroom was modern and very clean. We will be back for sure. I highly recommend.",

There are a plethora of Mexican restaurants in the valley and I am always up for trying one out.  This place is good!  It's a new spin on old Mexican classics.  Chips and salsa were a nice start...I ordered a trio of tacos and each one was delicious (BBQ pork was AMAZING)!  I will say the margarita was lacking.  Not too pleased with it for $8.  But I will definitely return for the tacos.  Seriously I can't stop thinking about the yumminess!  And the Mexican Street Corn you can order as a side is out of this world.  Costs $1 extra than just a side of beans.  But totally worth it :)",

It was our first time at any Blanco location, not only did she take the time to go over the menu, she was made aware that one of us had a glutten allergy and educated us on what options would best suit our needs. She was timely, friendly and up beat.   The restaurant itself seemed great. We chose to sit outside and enjoyed happy hour margaritas (what a great value). We both had street tacos, I had the \"Award winning\" bbq beef and my partner had the fish. We both thought our dishes were great. The side of street corn was absolutely to die for.   Of course it being a Sam Fox restaurant the decor was lovely and everyone was super hip. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for great service, contemporary mexican and a great margarita.",

The place seemed to have a nice vibe - it definitely looked like a Fox style restaurant in terms of the way the kitchen looked and the Urban feel.   I ordered the Chicken Mole and Holy Mole was it yummy! To be honest I was NOT expecting it to be nearly as off the hook delicious as it turned out. Frankly I expected something quite ordinary which is standard fare for most small chains.   But no, this Mole was deep and complex - and certainly reminded me of some of the best Mole restaurants I've been to.   Making a good Mole is a huge pain - a laundry list of ingredients and slow cooking times. The chicken itself was butter tender, with mostly dark meat and no bones to speak of... just heaven on a fork with flavors of exotic spices, cinnamon, chocolate and many more all mingling together to create a 5 star Mole experience (my opinion). Yes there was a little heat, but just enough kick to know it was there and not a drop more... perfect!  The side dish was a kind of brown rice, and a vegie mix - excellent as well.  The serving staff was outstanding as well - especially JORDAN and Emma. Very positive, attentive, friendly and accommodating.   I will 100% be coming back here - Blanco Tacos exceeds expectations and I can't wait to try some of their other dishes. This place is great.",

    "text": "Oh my God, finally a FOX winner in Phoenix. My consort and I tend to avoid Fox restaurants due to negative experiences. Their restaurants are usually located in upscale neighborhoods, focusing more on modern interior design and ambiance, and crowded with wannabe foodies and the tragically trendy crowd. Most disappointing is the lack of taste and a cuisine deficiency.  We visited the taqueria for a casual weeknight dinner. We were drenched walking toward the entrance of the restaurant from a 'mister monsoon' located in the alfresco patio. These misters were like foggy nor'easter, not the usual drizzle effect. I know because my hair, a barometer of humidity, became frizzy within two minutes.  For starters, we ordered the guacamole, chips, and Mexican street corn, a blend of roasted corn relish hand-cut off the cob and a bowl of corny delight. The magic show began with a bowl of chips disappearing soon after the mashed avocado appeared with a touch of tomato, roasted chili, caramelized onion, and a sprinkling of cojita cheese.  Our tag team servers included a pro and a first night trainee, both attentive and full of personality. We chose a classic Greyhound with a twist to accompany our starters--their version included a grapefruit infused Vodka served in an eight ounce glass rather than a 16 ounce, which would have been preferred. The drink, tart and tasty, left one wanting the missing eight ounces.  My consort ordered a nontraditional enchilada served hot in a cast iron pan with a cheesy red sauce poured over flat corn tortillas instead of the usual roll-ups. Side dishes of pinto beans and buttered rice complimented the dish. I selected the grilled fish tacos on corn tortillas with avocado and a house-made Pico. The perfectly pleasing fillets, flaky and flavorful, rested on three mini tortillas. After a squirt of lime, I devoured the trio.  Satisfying our hunger, we had no room for the sopapillas and honey or the brown sugar flan which we've sampled in the past. Instead we sat and chatted with Matt Runkle, assistant manager, who told us his theory of running a successful restaurant, \"My goal is to please the customer and leave my ego at the door.\" He went on to say, \"I might be a certain type of person outside of the restaurant, but when I'm managing, it's all about the patrons.\"  Lucky Sam Fox to have a manager like Matt running the show. Finally, a winner for el Zorro.  I am the DinnerSlut.",

However, the second bartender on staff was slow to help us. She delivered us a dirty plate and after we brought it to her attention, she failed to get us new plates. In the mean time, she unloaded the bar dishwasher and cleaned several glasses. While she was doing this, we had to ask our main bartender to get us clean plates all the while our food was getting cold. I certainly understand there are a number of items which need to be done while bartending, but the customer should be the priority.",

The food happy hour menu has lots of options as well and depending on what you order will depend on if it's a good value. The tacos are 3.50 for a street taco, which is an awfully high happy hour price for a street taco. With that said it was a good taco. I've had both the beef and chicken. The dips appetizer is good, I love the queso and guacamole dips, but could do without the beans. It has a smokey flavor which I'm not a fan of, but know a lot of people who are. The quesadilla is good not great but definitely a value on happy hour. I added beef this visit which gave it some more flavor. Service is always great here. Wish I loved the food more.",

Didn't order any meals but we ordered the guacamole to go with the chips and salsa. It was amazing! Kinda spendy but worth it for the amount they give you and the quality.

Our bartender recommended we get the dips to snack on as we chatted and drank our margaritas. The queso and the bean dip were both really good, and my friend really enjoyed the guac (which I'm not a huge fan of in general).   If I wind up back in this area, I'd definitely try out this place again on the sole fact they can make a solid margarita.",

Our server was amazing about checking on all the questions we had about dishes and she was on top of all of our drinks.   Some of us started with the spicy margarita and it had the perfect amount of spice and was well balanced. The blood orange margarita was amazing too, full of delicious blood orange color and flavor. The table started with the queso and guac, the chips that came with these were crispy warm and perfectly salted which was a great accompaniment to the dips.   We all hemmed and hawed over what to get because it all looked so good and to be honest we all ended up sharing any way. I am a huge carnitas fan and loved it in the taco. I also tried the enchiladas and they were all amazing, the sauces had great depths of flavor.   The manager was amazing and brought out a dessert sampler she put together herself and a candle for my sisters birthday. The staff was amazing, the drinks were delicious, the food was scrumptious, and the atmosphere was fun!",

My friend had the tacos with beans and rice, which she said was ALSO delicious.  The BESTEST (lol) part was that I mentioned I was allergic to shellfish and the waitress stated that the chips were fried in the same grease as the shrimp. SO a VERY NICE and KIND woman came out and offered to go to their sister store next door and get me some chips from there because they do not have shellfish on the menu. WONDERFUL!  She brought them over with a fresh cup of my own salsa.  THAT is SERVICE! I SOOOO appreciated that.  WOW!  I will be back and will HIGHLY recommend Blanco to friends and colleagues.

Being so close to Mexico, you would think the food would be more authentic.  The food and service are very poor.  The service was awful.  Our waitress did not want to be there and made it very obvious with the eye rolling when asked questions or asking for extra chips and refills of water.  We stopped asking for anything as she was worthless and should not be in a client facing role!  The food was bad chain food gone even worse with absolutely no QA on the food.  The fish tacos were terrible.  Instead of wheres the beef? this was where's the fish?  We could not find any on these tiny fish tacos.  Just terrible.  The salsa was closer to ketchup than salsa.  One of the worst salsas we have ever had.  The food looks pre cooked and thrown into a blast oven.  Not even close to fresh.  The fajitas were asked to have half/half steak and chicken but I asked three times to make sure the chicken is not over cooked as chicken breast will dry out immediately when it is not cooked properly.  Well, I was right and regretted it.  The chicken was as tough as leather and tasteless.  The steak was served and looked like dog food.  The presentation was non-existent.  The burritos lacked flavor and no spice at any level.  The tacos were terrible as again, no taste.  We should have just found a good taqueria as the price would have been better and the food would have been light years better.  Sooooooooo disappointed at this establishment.  Peoples taste buds have been blinded and people are taste blind who eat here.  Perhaps it's the booze that makes the food better for others.  However, for our group, nothing was even close to being on the mark.",

Every appetizer is half price and the appetizer menu is pretty extensive in my opinion.  Of course, there's a decent selection of drinks, too.  This most recent visit to Blanco was on a Saturday evening so...no Happy Hour.  I ordered the tacos...and really appreciate that you can order 3 different tacos if you choose.  You can also pick between flour or corn tortillas...or a mix of both.  The meal comes with cilantro rice and your choice of beans. This isn't an authentic mexican spot (if that's what you're looking for).  The chips and salsa are complimentary and better than the average free chips/salsa.  The service has always been very good no matter which Blanco location I've visited.  I will say, this location is now my favorite.  When it came time for the bill, the college-age-looking waiter asked if we wanted separate bills.  That would be normal, right?  Except, I was having dinner with my daughter.  So, did he think we were friends?  Did he think I was her age or she was mine?  I'm gonna go with the first option!  ;-)  haha",

She warned me that it was \"not authentic\" Mexican food, but we were in a hurry and didn't feel like walking the extra 40 yards to the Cheeesecake Factory. Not that the Cheesecake Factory is great, but that's another story... Anyway, I ordered the Blanco salad with chicken, and she had a couple of different tacos with a side of black beans. Oh, but first our server brought out some chips and salsa. Chips were grocery store grade and salsa was super bland. Basically tomato sauce with chunks of onion or something. Weak. Our server said they had a spicier salsa we could try. It had that smoked flavor that we don't care for and it was barely spicier than the first salsa. I get a lot of salads from a lot of places, and this was the lamest $12 salad I've ever had. They could take a note from Keegan's down the street as to what a $12 salad should look like. It was just mixed greens with onions, pepitos (woohoo...), some other vegs and a vinegarette of some sort. The chicken (extra $4) was sparse, chopped into tiny pieces, and unremarkable. My girlfriend's tacos looked great, but were bland and tasted nothing like real Mexican food. She let me have her shrimp taco and I was shocked at how bad it was. Shrimp was undercooked and the sauce was bland, like mayo. They brought her out an extra taco because they messed up her order, but neither one of us even wanted to eat it. Black beans were ok, but didn't taste like Mexican beans at all. In summary; the food looks great, is generally good quality, but just doesn't taste great. Service was excellent. I feel sorry for people who think this is good Mexican food. Save your money and go to that no name taco shop in a cheap strip mall, you'll enjoy the food better.",

It arrived and I got no beans, no rice and for $19 I got some grilled veggies a scope or guacamole and sour cream 5 tortillas and 6 shrimp. Yes I said correctly 6 shrimp.  So 5 tortillas  and 6 shrimp so either I can put 1 shrimp on each tortilla and have a shrimp left over or put 2 shrimps and have 2 tortillas left over. But something isnt adding up right.  $3 a shrimp is ridiculous.  Complained to manager and was told the shrimp are expensive.  I will never go back. I have been going here for 10 years. And the other tacos we got were dry like the desert",

I got the Carne Asada Burrito (Enchilada style) for $14 and I kinna regret it. It was a bit too salty (or maybe I'm just a salty bitch) the chips and salsa was the best part of this dinner. So would I come here and or recommend this NO. It's truly over price but it's an upscale area so enough said. The server was on point with drink refills and checking on our table often and she was super sweet.",

The thing about this spot is the walk up window (check the hours!) The food is much more affordable, reasonable portions, and still fresh and well seasoned Mexican fare. I will regularly come to the Biltmore to grab some $3 Nachos, a Shrimp Po'Boy; sit by the fountain, do some shopping and enjoy the outdoor patio.  DO try Blanco...just do it properly.",

One thing that I loved about BT+T was the Micheladas and Shandies. For my first, I ordered the Oaxacan Shandy with Jose Cuervo Tradicional, Solerno, Pineapple, Cilantro, Tecate Lager. With that I had a small order of Warm Queso Blanco dip with Chips for $3; pretty good and inexpensive.   To eat, I tried to pick something small but the fish taco plate was quite filling. It was only $14 for three tacos with rice and beans. The rice was a little bland, but everything else was great. With that, I tried the Grapefruit Elderflower Shady with Belvedere Grapefruit, Elderflower, Fresh Grapefruit and Modelo Especial.   I'll be back the next time I'm in town, it was a good time even for a solo lunch. Great refreshing Shandies and appetizers.",

Can I just say to begin with.... those chips and salsa are ADDICTING. Like cannot stuff my face enough of them even with ordering a full meal...even with having eaten a small protein-full snack beforehand. What do they put in them?!? Besides the chips and salsa (and queso!), you gotta go with the tacos or the Mexican Salad. Tacos come either with flour or corn tortillas [go with corn!] and cannot recommend enough the street corn side instead of the standard rice or beans. You will have #NoRegerts spending the $1 or so extra for street corn! Crispy shrimp tacos = a little too spicy but really good.  Carnitas = mouth-watering Mahi = fresh fresh fish  The menu is fairly simple and straightforward with hefty tequila/southwestern flavor drinks on one side and taco/street foods on the other. The margs IMO tend to taste a little too sour for myself, but the flavors are totally there. My faves are the Italian blood orange & the hibiscus flower. If you want no-frills, go for the skinny marg. The bartenders are happy to make any small changes to the drinks if you ask. All of us",

I didn't get it with meat but was still full after (probably also after two bowls of chips and salsa). My friend got chicken fajitas and they were sizzling hot. She said she enjoyed them, also the amount of chicken was very generous. We noticed as soon as the lunch hour was over (about 2) it cleared out ALOT, so if you want a later lunch or avoid the crowds I would shoot for them. As for the server, she was attentive keeping the water filled, asking if we wanted to refill the chips and offered to split the check even tho we didn't need it. She was great.",

    "text": "I truly love the Fox family of restaurants and Blanco is no exception however this location employs some of the most tactless and rude employees I have ever personally experienced at any Fox restaurant. We stopped going about a year ago after the bartender made a mistake on our tab and only realized it after we had paid and tipped. Once he realized his mistake, he came to us and told us he had made a mistake, charged us the wrong tab, so the one we had paid was more expensive and he didn't want us to have to pay the extra. So, he reran everything, except he lied, his error was he charged us for a tab that was cheaper than ours so now the new tab was more expensive. Frist, I felt lied to and secondly, he never gave us an itemized receipt to view before recharging us this \"new\" correct tab. I found it deceptive and if he made a mistake and charged us less, well then that was his mistake and to make us waste our time while he supposedly fixed it, is completely tacky.   We finally decided we'd give this place another shot and stopped in for an early dinner one evening around 4:45pm. When they started to seat us at a high-top table, we requested to sit at a normal table due to an injury that is aggravated by high top tables. We were brought back to the front, the two ladies talked and then said, well we can sit you at a low top table, but you will be required to be done in no more than 45 minutes. I get reservations but unless those reservations specifically state a low top table, then put them at the high-top table and allow the low tops to be seated in first come first served. If indeed ALL your reservations are booked for low top tables, then politely explain that situation but don't tell someone to be gone in 45 minutes. That is incredibly tacky and tasteless.   Again, Blanco is fantastic, but this location seems to have some employee issues, so try another location and just skip this one.",

    "text": "Fair try, overall service was just ok but this modern mexican cuisine leaves a lot to ask for. There was good and bad throughout. Salsa came out super cold and bland and did not complement the warm chips well at all.   Their version of guacamole is nothing more than mashed up avocados with lime and salt. We had to ask for extra pico, cilantro, jalapenos, and added salt and pepper and made our own guac with their ingredients.  We ordered the tacos, well done. I just wish you would give me a small lime wedge so we didn't have to bother the 'runner' yet again. The side of charro beans were a joke. Nothing more than boiled and dried up bland pinto beans, please pass the salt again or pass this place up altogether.",

    "text": "Blanco Tacos seems like a great place to enjoy happy hour ... inviting bar that allows you to sit outdoors or indoors, great happy hour prices for both drinks and food... And then there is reality.  I sat down and the bar and was greeted by the bartender, who offered me a dinner menu, asked what I wanted to drink, and asked if I wanted chips and salsa. I ordered a beer in an unfrosted glass, and said I would love some chips and salsa. The beer came as promised. Props for having Torpedo on tap.   Another couple sat down next to me, were greeted by a bartender, offered the happy hour menu, drink specials, and chips and salsa. The other bartender then came over to me and offered me the happy hour menu when there were now six minutes before the end of happy hour.  And she asked if I wanted chips and salsa.   The first bartender came back over, and I ordered one of each of the happy hour tacos, and asked if I wanted chips and salsa. Third times the charm right? Wrong...  I did get my happy hour tacos, a second beer at happy hour prices even though the hand had swung past the witching hour but never received chips and salsa. The tacos were very good. Hand made corn tortillas, great fillings. I especially liked the beef with the chipotle. And the carnitas with the salsa verde were very good too.   In the restaurant industry, attention to detail is what is important. I do not fault the bartenders. They were personable, gracious, and truly represented the business well. I fault the management of this location. You never allow your staff to become this sloppy.",

He talked to us ladies about our body weight, that we don't look like we can handle alcohol, continuously insulting us. We wanted to order food but he continued to lecture. The average age was 50, we were having fun and enjoying each other's company like the only other two tables in the restaurant. Horrible manager=horrible restaurant.",

I mean, I like them, and I've never had a bad experience at one, but I just don't go as crazy for them as others seem to.   The first time I went to Blanco Tacos (the Scottsdale location) I didn't like it at all. All I remember was having a bland over-priced quesadilla that left me with no real desire to come back,  Well, a friend from out of town was staying in this area for work so I met them for HH here. Honestly, that might be the reason I had a pretty positive experience. If you knock a few bucks off drinks and apps during the early evening hours I'm generally pretty happy.   I had a couple margs and they were good. Nothing necessarily stood out about them, but they were a little more on the strong side & not real sweet so I was happy.   We split some apps as well. Again, everything was good, but nothing really stood out. We had guacamole & the queso blanco dip. I have to say, I REALLY like the standard salsa they the give you, It has a bit of kick, but is still tasty.   At the end of the day Blanco has a solid HH that I'd come back to. I should note that they are strict about the cut-off time. We ordered a round of margs, like, right after 6 (honestly, I'm pretty sure we got them right at 6) and were charged full price on them. We didn't say anything, and it wasn't a big deal, but I just thought it should be noted.",

We ordered the salad with fresh grilled Mahi-Mahi and it was excellent. Then we ordered a chicken poblano cheese crisp. The cheese crisp was good but the chicken was a bit bland. I had ordered a carne asada burrito enchilada style with green sauce.  This is where things started to go not so good. They had delivered the salad and cheese crisp fairly quickly but the burrito was not so quick. After waiting for more than 20 minutes for the burrito I had ordered it was finally delivered but with red sauce, not green sauce, which is what I ordered. By this time I was pretty full from the salad, cheese crisp and the chips and salsa, which were also pretty good, so I ended up sending the burrito back.  Although there were some issues with our dinner the service was absolutely amazing, our server was excellent and he management ended up taking great care of us. We are hoping to try this restaurant again and I am looking forward to updating my review.",

    "text": "I love Blanco Tacos and Tequila in Scottsdale for their fresh ingredient menu as well as the outside firepits and patio! Now that there is a Blanco at Biltmore,  I was anxious to see how this location fared against the Scottsdale one. I was not let down.  My best friend., Jeran and I decided Blanco was perfect during some impulsive shopping in Biltmore Fashion Park and we noticed, NOT only was it Taco Tuesday, BUT, it was happy hour!! Double win! We started with freshly made margaritas and the Blanco's Famous freshly made guacamole off the half off happy hour menu. HALF OFF!!! You can't go wrong with a margarita, guac, and gossip on a hot summer day in the desert!   I am blown away by the quantity of tequila choices at Blanco. From blanco to anejo to reposado to ultra tequilas, and even a couple of mezcals for the super brave! There are more than fifty plus types of tequila to line up with your salt and lime. Impressive! I had not ever paid attention to all the variety before and it's important for any place highlighting 'tequila' in it's title. If it were a weekend night , this would be one place to begin , or end the fun. Because we all know what tequila does !? Our waiter was very helpful in suggesting what tequila to match our tastes and for our choice of margaritas.The margaritas on the menu are 'built' with a certain tequila, but you are able to change them up, if you would like. Good to know!  He also kept us hydrated with never allowing our h2o to go beyond half empty ... Or half full? I opted for the White Peach and Hibiscus margarita and my buddy stuck with his usual , the  Classic marg. Yum with a caramba! Thank Jose we had more shopping at Biltmore to do, as that libation went down way too fast and too smoothly...   As far as food, I had the Seafood Salad. Full of fresh veggies and jicama;   I added grilled shrimp to it, as well. Not heavy on the dressing, and it honestly didn't need it with as loaded and tasty as the salad was. Perfect!  Jeran had a Carne Asada Burrito, which I swear he was so picky in ordering, I can't remember what he ended up with, (or maybe that was the tequila again?) ; But when it arrived, he was happy!   The waiter, again, never missed a beat and we both walked away with NO tacos on Tuesday , ( I think it's original  reason we wanted Blanco on this day??!) again... Tequila ! But we did walk away to shop tipsy ...full and happy! Yay! Hasta luego Blanco .. Until we meet again! Maybe for that Taco Tuesday??",

I've had the tacos before as this is obviously a taco joint.  I loved them every time. I went against habit this last time and ordered the chicken mole and disliked it immensely.  I'm only downgrading one star because I've been to this location and the Scottsdale location so many times that I know they do better. The mole was not 'mole' as I was expecting as it was really really sweet. And kind of 'red'. It was weird. That and the chicken was served in a bowl with rice.  It was just not my liking.     That being said, I've loved the tacos, enchiladas and the shrimp/crab ceviche as well.    Good happy hour deals as well.",

It was chaotic when I ordered and the young girl taking my order was more interested in what the manager was doing and her coworkers.   Then I finally went up and saw my food sitting there. The girl told me it was a shift change and to tell her what I ordered. The one that took my order came back, as she was leaving she realize and finished getting my food. Sorry for the inconvenience that I wanted you to finish what you started. The manager there seemed clueless as well. She hurriedly gave it to me. So sad for Sam Fox that he hires young kids with no work ethic.   Not sure I am comfortable telling clients to go there. They expect good service, even for a \"fast\" window.",

We had this awesome waitress who made our experience very pleasurable. The food comes out very quickly, which pleasantly surprised me!   We ordered appetizers from their happy hour menu. We had their nachos, quesadilla and three dips. All were good, but I would recommend their nachos, lots of toppings and flavor! For dinner, I had their carne asada tacos. It came with three tacos along with beans and rice. Add some hot sauce to those tacos and you are set! My sister got the Mexican cobb salad, brother got cheese enchiladas, his partner for fajitas. Didn't get to taste, but it all looked delicious.   Overall, I highly recommend this place for anyone to try a contemporary twist on Mexican food. Excellent customer service, environment and awesome food. I can't wait to go back again!",

My only quibble with my experience is I don't like raw tomatoes and I purposely selected tacos that didn't have tomatoes on them, but 2 of my 3 tacos had diced tomato on them that I had to pick off.

    "text": "Swanky Scottsdale taco shop.  Nice looking place in an upscale area.  Looks aside unfortunately the food was not what I was looking for.  You can usually judge a taco shop by its salsa and guac.  The guac here was very vanilla.  It was almost pure avacado with a tiny bit of cheese and tomatoes on top.  It could have used some jalapeno, lime, salt, and zest.  The salsa was similarly lacking both heat and flavor.  It tasted like blended tomatoes with a tad bit of chiles and some garlic and salt.  They played it too safe for an experienced palate.  I had the bbq tacos with rice and charro beans.  The tacos were tasty but incredibly small.  When I say small I mean I didn't realize they made totillas that small small.  The beans were good and the rice was probably my favorite out of it all.  Very good flavor, nice texture.  Moist without being wet.  Well done.  Unfortunately, the price is on par with the area instead of the food.  I'm sure rent isn't cheap here so you probably already know what you are getting into.   If you are looking for mild food with a nice ambiance then Blanco is for you.  If you are looking for authentic, good price, and some heat then keep on moving.",

Surely someone will screech that the food isn't Mexican enough, and I don't know about all that, but I do know it is delicioso! And they have everything, really. They have ample seating inside, outside, at a bar, and they even have a order/take-out window just next door with options for people who just want to dine and dash . . . after paying.  I tend to order a hibiscus green tea with a carne asada burrito (enchiliada-style, Christmas-style sauce), rice, and black beans. Everything on the menu is good, though. My buddy loves their mole (if you're envisioning a furry animal, let Google handle this one). Ask for the habanero sauce with your chips!",

It is the perfect place to grab a fulfilling and tasty dinner after shopping at the Biltmore or during, they have a takeout window!    Two of my friends and I stopped in here around 5 pm after a long day of shopping for an early dinner.  We chose to sit outside and were seated at a low table with some couches.  The table had a cool mosaic design and the couch was a fun place to sit, although probably not the best place for a messy eater (I may or may not have spilled salsa on my shirt haha!).  The waitress brought warm tortilla chips and salsa which we absolutely loved (so much so that we got another basket and slightly spoiled our dinner!)  After looking at the menu for awhile we ordered.  I got the roasted chicken and poblano chile cheese crisp, one friend got the grilled fish tacos and the other got the green chile pork enchilada.  I had never had a cheese crisp before but it is certainly an interesting concept.  It reminds me of a Mexican pizza and had good flavor and a nice crunch to it.  I would definitely order it again but without the pico de gallo which kind of overwhelmed the flavor of the meat and cheese.  The fish tacos looked a bit small and I did not try them but my friend enjoyed them.  The enchilada came out in a dish and looked almost like lasagna but the flavor was amazing.  The tacos and enchilada came with rice and beans and the rice had good flavor and a nice buttery texture.  Next time I go to the Biltmore I'll have to stop at this place or try one of their other locations.",

Offered an outside table if we wanted which sounded like a great & different idea for us in December!  Chips and Salsa right away! Awesome Chips, Salsa was boring and not chunky like I prefer.  Awesome and helpful waitress that was very attentive, offered to explain the menu in full, but we pretty knew what we wanted!   Started off with a Happy Hour Dip Trio(Charro Beans, Queso, Guacamole) and I went for a $5 H-H Classic Margarita on the Rocks and my wife went for the $5 H-H Mixed Berry Margarita. We were even asked; Salt, Sugar, or Nothing on the Rim!  The Dip Trio was yummy, standout being the Guacamole. Super fresh! Beans were nice and creamy with tiny little pieces of bacon, Queso was a tasty addition as well.  Margaritas were great as well! Mine was just a perfect example of a Classic, wife's had a nice, but not overwhelming Berry Flavor!   We also ordered the Shrimp and Crab Ceviche which was very simple, yet divine. Most places simply over do the Citrus, not the case here. It was present, but didn't dominate the dish. Awesome shrimp and crab pieces in there!   Moving on to our actual meal. My wife went for the Chipotle Shrimp Tacos with black beans. Again, perfect Shrimp, nice flavor, awesome Tortillas!(More than likely homemade)   I went for some goodies from the H-H Menu; Beef Taco, Pork Taco, BBQ Pork Torta(Think Big Slider Size) Every thing was great as expected! BBQ Pork was tender with great BBQ flavor and a little heat. Beef and Pork Tacos shared the same tenderness with lots of flavor! $3 Happy Hour Tacos(BIG) and $4 Happy Hour Torta! M-F 4p-6p  As you can see, YES we ordered a lot of food! And pretty much ate it all short of some of the beans and chips! A place that we will definitely go back to in the future when we're in the mood for more of a sit-down type of Mexican Dinner!",
