    "text": "We showed up and committed the cardinal sin of dining, arriving with a 12 top and no advance warning for the restaurant. Our group kind of grew last minute, was supposed to be four of us originally, and it wasn't really planned, but we were worried we wouldn't be able to find anywhere to seat us as it was Saturday night and busy everywhere. The owner (I think he was the owner?) was beyond gracious and accommodating and made it work for our group with only a brief delay to get us seated (which we would have been happy to wait as long as needed).  Food and service at The Kettle Black was excellent and we were extremely impressed with how accommodating the staff were with what I know from experience is a major pain, large groups are never fun to host! Wait time for food was very much within the norms for busy dinner service, and no orders were incorrect or \"lost\".   Service aside, the food was beyond excellent. The appetizers (we tried the cheese steak fries, the buffalo chicken fries, and the hot bavarian pretzels) were all very well done and large enough to share. The only suggestion I'd make for the restaurant is that the pretzels should come with just a bit more cheese sauce as that ran out pretty quickly. That said, the hot pretzel was probably one of the best I've had anywhere and I'm a sucker for a giant pretzel.  Entres were just as good, 1st street burger was done to perfection and was very well flavored, and the pork belly mac and cheese was excellent.  Beer selection was great and I really enjoyed the scotch ale and the maui coconut porter which is one you don't see everywhere.  I'm not in phoenix much these days, but I'd come back here in a heartbeat! Though, if I have a large group next time I'll make sure to call in advance ;)",

The sat us table for two and immediately we received water not Phoenix water filtered thanks for that. 30 seconds in Michael gave us some beer advise Pumkin Ale and North Mountain Scotch Ale. Let's get a pretzel I think and the answer is yes get it great buttery flavor tummy cheese sauce made here fresh and ground mustard. It was gone quick paired with our beers. Ok onward another round a beers and two burgers. We had the classic and the bacon onion burger we had the fries get those not the salad or coleslaw your eating a burger for Christ sake eat fries. Those came paired so well with beer that it disappeared post haste awesome good burger be fries. So norm we don't do dessert but so far the food is rockin beers are stellar..... So he'll ya lets do dessert.  There is only one bread pudding.  It ain't ur mammy's bread pudding. A decadent dessert paired with a deliciousness sauce and some Irish coffee umm ya do it!!!!!

It was delicious with a light cucumber refreshing flavor on a hot day. I ended up getting a fish and chips plate, which the manager suggested. When it came, I was surprised it was only one piece of fish, but it was a HUGE piece of fish. Crispy and flaky fish, but the coleslaw was not worth finishing. Fries were decent too. I had some time to kill, so I decided to try the bread pudding dessert, and it was tasty and filling. I would definitely come back for the beer, and I would probably order different food.",

There are also several, well priced  wines on the menu too. Cocktails are there, but there wasn't a cocktail menu to go from.. and that is okay.. I like that they keep it simple. My hubby and shared the mussels that are fresh, steamed and bathed in yummy, garlicky, wine sauce that comes with Irish brown bread for soaking that yummy goodness up with. The Reuben is authentic and good! A pub should always have a Reuben! This sandwich was thick with fresh cooked corned beef, just enough saurkraut, Swiss cheese, thousand island dressing all on marbeled rye bread. This was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time.. sometimes a Reuben can be salty, because corned beef is so salty.. it just is! This wasn't ! Now this was my hubby's sammy, so I could only snag a bite or two.. but I had a bit of order envy! I had the Blackened Chicken Sandwich, which was also very good. A good portioned chicken breast filet, blackened, topped with peppered crisp bacon, Swiss cheese, an avocado and a really good limey, peppery mayonnaise on a ciabatta bread. I had a side salad with my sandwich and my husband got the fries. Speaking of fries... LOTS of fry variety on the menu for drink noshing! Truffled fries; Garlic and Rosemary fries; Curry fries.. BUT also, more extreme fries like : Buffalo Fries that come with shredded chicken , blue cheese crumbles and dressing ! Totally reminds me of a night out of pub crawling in Ireland.. they love some fries over there when the drunchies hit:-) I was looking forward to more 'Pub' fare and had perused the menu prior to our stop into Kettle Black. I didn't see the , ' Across the Pond' part of the menu that has all day Irish breakfast and Veggie Pasty and my fav from the Irish lads: Shepherds Pie. They did have Corned Beef and Cabbage on the menu and the Fish and Chips.. so hopefully when we get back, this part of the menu is back too, as a real pub , should have some real pub food! That said.. I like this place.. A lot! The owner strolls around and says hi to everyone and the bathrooms are clean. I love that this is a new great place in downtown that isn't clubby and has more of a trendy, quaint feel. I would love to eventually see live music come in for a night or two ! Cant wait to go back!",

    "text": "The Good:  - Great location  - Authentic pub feel  - Wooden floors or faux wood, either way, very nice touch  - The build/construction of the actual bar, the liquor display, the area where the bartender works just screams pub.  - Curb appeal doesn't get better, opened red wooden shutters onto sidewalk cafe is warm and inviting.  - Liquor menu is no nonsense, relatively small but carefully selected varieties of bourbon, whiskey and scotch. The mixed drink menu was not available, I understand it is being reworked.   - This place just opened and it has great promise if they can work out some of the bugs.  I expect to write another more glowing review in a few months.  The not so good:  - Flat screen HD TV's all over the place showing basketball.  Nothing and I mean nothing kills pub atmosphere more quickly and thoroughly than TV sports.  You can go anywhere to watch crap sports, it would be nice to find a watering hole where you could escape sports.  People tend to disengage from each other and look up at the TV.  Instead of strangers meeting and having conversation, they just look up at the TV like they are in a dazed state.  Even couples who enter together often do the same, and if they do try having a conversation, the TV's are so distracting they can't keep a single train of thought.  If you have to show sports, why not something different like rugby, Irish hurling, Aussie football, professional darts do something to set yourself apart from every other sports bar out there?  If you want to turn a bar into an instant ghetto, put up a bunch of TV's and play the big four, NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB.  - The music was awful.  Such care and effort went into designing and building this wonderful space  just to have it ruined by (I will be kind here)  \"urban\" music.  It's a pub, why not play more traditional anglo Irish music?  Again, Majerles and any number of  other sports bars are just around the corner.  - The menu mirrors the music and TVs, too busy, too much and incongruent with the space.  Turkey burgers, kabobs, Southwest chicken wrap, wasabi Caesar wrap, black bean burgers ....  My advice is to keep it simple and keep it authentic, if you try to be all things to all people you end up being nothing to anybody.  A menu like this stresses out the kitchen, leads to waste, spoilage and does little to enhance the atmosphere or reputation.  The \"Across The Pond Fare\" on the menu was not available as it also is being reworked.  The menu should consist of ONLY the \"Across The Pond Fare\", Irish Breakfast, rashers, Pastys, Shepherd's Pie, Cottage Pie, blood sausage, black sausage, white sausage, fish and chips, corned beef and cabbage.  If you have to serve burgers, keep it simple.  - There is a bit of confusion at the front gate.  The iron fencing around the sidewalk cafe is black and so is the gate.  I saw several groups of people having a little trouble locating the gate as they tried to enter the pub.  A nice coat of red paint that matches the shutters or a decorative piece attached to the gate would help people find their way in.  In closing, the Kettle Black has everything in place to become a great success, something on par with the pubs of D.C., N.Y. and Boston.",

    "text": "My friend arrived before I, and specifically asked what was on draft. The bar tender pointed at the chalkboard list. The first thing he ordered was out of stock. He then ordered a second choice, which was on the list. The bartender brought him a bottled beer. I then arrive and am quickly greeted by the bartender, my first question is \"What do you have on draft?\" I was pointed to the chalkboard, but my friend forwarns me that not all are draft. I see a beer I am interested and ask if it is on draft, and am told no it's a can. I realize this bartender is not going to put any effort into helping me find a draft. So then I peak around the post that the chalkboard is on and see that Magner's is on draft and just order that. He then shows up with a can of the first beer I asked about. I don't think we could have been any more obvious that we were interested in a draft beer. I then tell him I ordered Magner's, which he quickly pours, as at this point I'm annoyed that he isn't listening and was going to cancel my order all together. Additionally the beer that was out of stock remained on the chalkboard, and was never erased for other to order and be disappointed. In the mean time our third friend is arriving, I meet her outside and tell her we will chug our beers and be out in a minute that this place is terrible and we are going somewhere else. We then get the bill $15 total, $8 for a bottled beer (what really $8 for a bottled beer!!!) and $7 for a Magner's (not as steep for the product, at least a draft beer). I will never go back, horrible service.h",

The salmon entree came with a butternut squash risotto that was probably the best I've tasted, and the dried cranberries gave a great sweet flavor that went well with everything else. But best of all, we were constantly checked upon and made sure that we didn't need anything. Judging from the menu, they have a long selection of beers and cocktails as well.",

Only complaint I had was they ran out of the liquor for one of their specialty drinks and they were out of their pretzels (delicious).

They aren't too badly priced especially for the quality of food you are getting. Highly, highly recommend.",

    "text": "Location:  5 Menu:  5 Service:  5 Environment:  5 Overall:  5  The Kettle Black is located within a short walk of the light rail at 3rd/Washington.  It is adjacent to Cartel coffee and the signage on the sidewalk will allow you to find this gem easily.  Location:  5  The lunch menu has diverse selections for most any palate including vegetarian fare.  The bartender, Gil, recommended a few of his favorites.  I went with the Southwest Chicken Wrap (with a side of buffalo sauce) and the soup of the day (it was tomato basil).  The food was served swiftly and the taste and texture were excellent.  The presentation of the dish was fun.  I didn't even touch my soup until after I devoured the wrap.  The mellowness of the tomato basil soup wonderfully complimented the spiciness I created on the wrap.  You can also swing through and catch happy hour from 4-7 daily.  Menu:  5  The laid back, pub style atmosphere invited me to seat myself when I arrived after lunch rush.  I sat at the bar as this was an excellent location for my service dog to chill out while I ate.  The staff did not acknowledge my service dog and served me, the customer!  This is not a common trait across the valley and I GREATLY appreciate their professionalism.  The food came out quickly and Gil ensured all of my needs were met throughout my meal.  Service:  5  The overall vibe for me was professionally chill.  The staff worked well together to ensure every customer had a great dining experience and didn't incessantly hover.  The artwork on the walls was among the more unique that I have seen in a restaurant.  The woodwork created an old pub feel.  The service made things fresh and fun.  Some of the booths would work well for a small team to have a working lunch.  Environment:  5  Overall, The Kettle Black is a great place for someone wanting to catch a quick bite from a diverse menu or that person who is wanting to take a break from downtown life and escape to an old pub with a fresh feel.  Be sure to ask the staff about some of the artwork or history of this fairly new pub in Downtown Phoenix.  Overall:  5",

The fish and chips was hearty and well portioned unlike many places. Their fries paired with curry sauce were delicious!  It is a smaller space so be prepared to wait if you're stopping by during a busy evening. If there's an event going on, it may not be the best time to pay them a visit unless you have time to kill.",

We tried the fries: over saturated with oil and salty.  The pork belly sliders: had a sweet honey sauce but was very dry which may be from the overcooked pork belly. Usually theres so much flavor and texture to pork belly, wish this was the case.  The 1st order burger: which had a great look but the final taste lacked seasoning or flavoring  in the meat. Bread and meat patty was breaking apart pretty easily which made finishing it harder.   Not to say all the food choices were bad, friends tried the grilled steak salad and mussels, didn't try this but they said it was good! Overall, we had a good time and would stop by again for drinks!  Thanks for reading, hope it helps!",

    "text": "I love the location and the pub style interior.    The place is central to a lot of other stuff downtown, and makes a great stop on a night of bar hopping.   Also love the bench seats where you can dine and drink while spectating on the passers-by outside.     I bookmarked the \"hot & new\" Kettle Black recently so after picking me up at Sky Harbor upon my 9pm return from an east coast trip, my wife promptly took me there on the way home.  En route, I called to determine if their kitchen was open late and to my relief (!!!!) they said I was good to go.   Really glad we decided to swing by for the evening.    The \"Rueban\" and truffle fries were delicious.  This is one of the better reubens I've had in a while, not that I eat that many of them.   If you like reubens though, you'll really like this one.   It's a great choice on the menu.  The chips....er, truffle fries...were also really good, and ample.  Speaking of chips...er...fries :), love that you can get them done any one of 6 ways.  Overall, they have a nice dinner menu with a decent range of items to select from in the starters & salad arena, sammy/burger/wrap category, a few entrees, and an \"across the pond\" selection of a few British/Irish items including a couple of pasty choices.    I like the menu.  There's lots here I would eat and it's perfectly fine that it's not 100% pure traditional British / Irish food.  I am totally down with the pub styling combined with the ability to get good American OR food from \"across the pond\".    I had a couple of draft brews that were cold and hit the spot as well and subsequently went back for a second visit to meet a buddy for happy hour.   Great beer selection.    Service was mediocre on my Sunday night dinner visit.   Bartender on my mid-week happy hour visit however was awesome and super friendly.",

We arrived roughly 1.5 hours before the concert was to start. We were seated right away which we didn't expect because the area we were in in Phoenix was busy due to the concert. Our waitress was friendly and got our drinks to us pretty quick. She took our order and we explained to her we were in town for the concert so we had to be ready to go by 6:45ish.  The food seemed to be taking a while but our waitress came by to top of our drinks. Later, the manager stopped by, without us saying a word about the long wait for food, and offered us free drinks and a discount on our dinner. He did say the restaurant filled up very quickly and unexpectedly and was very apologetic for the wait. Needless to say, the food was excellent and our dinners were highly discounted.  Great, great service!!  We'll definitely be back!",

By the time we were seated five minutes, empty tables were all around and they never filled up again while we were there. That is to be expected for the time of day. What wasn't expected was the scattered service. I'm not sure if they were understaffed or undermanaged, but the wait staff was struggling to get things together. A table near us waited quite awhile to get an order in. Our food took about 25 minutes. When ordering a second beer as the food arrived, it sat at the bar and never arrived at our table. The waiter seemed surprised when I asked him to take it off of the bill. He did the right thing by taking the other beer off as well. The atmosphere and food were great. I'd try the place again because I'm hoping this was a one-time problem with the wait staff.",

Better selection of darker beers than most places including some harder to find ones like Grooving with a Pict and Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, but of course there's the venue appropriate Guinness in all its endearing splendor.  The tender greens of the steak salad were the perfect bed for the tender rare steak that was cooked to perfection. I only intended to have one order of wings, but they were crisp and flavorful so couldn't resist, but they should have had a better mix of the drumettes and the other part of the wing, since one time I got all drumettes and the other time I got only two, so that was strange.  One doesn't usually mention celery esp. since it's usually curled from overlooking to make up for freshness, but these were fresh and not a brown end to be seen--could use more than the 3 small pieces though please. The other meals served around us looked delicious too: I spotted crispy fries and shiny-topped and plump sliders. Mikeal P. our server was a delight--helping with beer selections, never rushing us, AND able to answer my probably annoying questions about whose photos were on the walls (soccer stars and overseas politicians are not my strong suite)--bless him! However, there was one flaw for us and that was that the outdoor seating seemed to be set up for drinks only and the inside was so packed that the noise level was so high as to make our conversation very challenging. Maybe it was the lower tin ceilings or the narrowness of the room, so I might try another location than in the back near the bar, or try at different time of day....",

    "text": "My work trip to Phoenix involved long days and hungry nights. When it was finally time to check out the local scene, the first few walks around the Hyatt didn't speak to me. I took to yelp, and settled on The Kettle Black due to the high reviews. They weren't wrong.  Walked in and sat myself by one of their large televisions in the back. The design and photos definitely ring True to your typical Irish pub, although the lighting and ambience really adds a positive element. It's relaxing and low key. Not too bright, but not too dark like Irish pubs often are.  The seat I chose was the furthest table in, and low to the ground. It didn't bode well for me as a tall person. Avoid it due to the traffic from Kitchen and to the restrooms. But there are booths, high tops, and bar seating - something for everyone.   Was greeted with ice water by my server, and he promptly brought me a Guiness.  As I was browsing the menu with yelp in my other hand, it was obvious to one staff member that I was looking for guidance on the dinner choice. He suggested the braised pork ribs. Took his advice, and it really did taste great.  They are served with a side of Brussel sprouts and butter spaghetti squash - refreshing and creative side options. The spaghetti squash was awesome. It reminded me of a favorite pasta recipe I had as a kid. Not normally a fan of Brussel sprouts, but having not ate my veggies lately I decided to deal with them. They were the best in recent memory!   The rib was absolutely amazing. It melts in your mouth and is one of the more flavorful meat dishes I've experienced.  My only gripe with the plate is the ratio. There was far more squash and sprouts than rib. I found myself taking great care to make it last until the sides were gone, which involved eating at least 4 sprouts per bite of rib. Definitely left full, but would have much rather been full of the entree . This is an Irish pub. You're supposed to leave them drunk, and with meat sweats.    Normally, I'd bring the rating down with the ratio being so off. That said, the servers were great. Extremely attentive, very friendly, and they ended up saving the 5 star. My plate wasn't done for 30 seconds before the barback took it away. And they totally sold me on dessert.   I'd definitely suggest this restaurant to anyone looking for a place to eat in the area.",

    "text": "Loved my solo business travel dinner experience here! The only slight negative came on first impression when the host told me up front \"sit anywhere you want\" but when I picked a booth, he later asked me if I was solo and then asked me to move their smallest table. It was a bit awkward dining alone in the back middle of the pub but the service, food and beer made me soon forget that. The place has a cool British pub atmosphere which you can see from all the pics.  My server was Misty and I highly recommend anyone ask for specifically when she's on shift here. Their drinks list is extensive with seasonal draft beers changing all the time. Based on my inclinations for dinner Misty suggested the North Mountain Scotch Ale on draft. My water was delivered quickly and soon after the beer. One sip and I knew why it's their most popular brew. It's a fantastic non-hopped ale - this coming from a guy who loves hoppy IPAs. Misty was a True menu ambassador and offered crab cakes as a lighter appetizer since I knew I would try their well-reviewed fish & chips for the main course.  The crab cakes come with a lightly dressed salad for roughage. When they put it down in front of me I was worried by the really dark (looked burnt in the dim lighting) top and bottom crust. Once I tipped into it with my fork and tasted it all my worries went away. Delicious - superbly seasoned and it seems their hot pan sear strategy for the breading pays off with a more moist interior and crunchy crust.  I wasn't ready for the heft of a Porter or Oatmeal Stout for my second beer so Misty told me to try the Sentinel Peak Salida del Sol amber Mexican beer. Another solid suggestion! It is the most flavorful Mexican beer I've tasted, Negro Modelo included.  So now it was time for that famous fish & chips. Misty mentioned the fries can be served with their interesting house-made curry sauce. Other reviews are right - the focus is not the chips (fries.) They are tasty but not super crispy but the curry sauce makes a wonder dip. Remember curry sauce is a very British thing and not like real Indian food. It goes great with gastropub fare. The real Atlantic Cod fillet was fried beautifully with a crispy crust and moist, flaky but firm meat. By this time I was full so couldn't polish off the entire filet. This establishment is best enjoyed with friends or co-workers sharing plates. The place was pretty hopping for a Monday night as well. Highly recommended!",

The service was great there was someone that constantly went around to fill out water glasses. My California Club was good but the Jerk Chicken & Pork Belly sliders portion were too small. Another thing, if you are in a party of 8 or more people they put the tab on one check. I was in a party of 12 & having to figure out who pays for on our own was difficult. I just wish this place was able to split checks in a big party.",

Staff is always extra friendly and helpful, energy is casual and you are free to sit whenever you please so no formalities of people assigning a seat for you which adds to the relaxed environment of the place. If you are in for dinner, we highly recommend the mussels and tomato soup. The mussels both is delicious!! We keep coming back just for that dish. And the tomato soup makes the perfect companion to the mussels. Their wide selection of local and imported beers allows for your to enjoy a traditional Irish or English beer that goes perfectly with your dinner. We love this place!",

I was greeted immediately by a friendly server.  The server came back and explained the menu and gave us recommendations. We ended up ordering the wings that we had heard so much about. We got the medium and sweet chili. The wings were fried/ baked and we ordered the fish and chips with garlic fries. The food was very good and the service was top notch, our servers name was Wesley and he took excellent care of us. As for alcohol they have a full bar with plenty selection. They have a few tv with different types of sports playing and the music was a mix of 80's soft rock. I look forward to going back.",

This was my first time visiting kettle black. I came with a group of about 12 tonight before the game. Our server helped us to select items from the menu and drinks, all of which were fantastic. I had the 1st and Washington cocktail, and the scallops. They were perfectly tender and flavorful! We ordered many apps including wings and buffalo chicken fries. Everything, and I mean everything tantalized the taste buds!!! The decor was properly suited for an Irish Pub, gives you feel like you are somewhere in Ireland. I give Kettle black a 5 star all the way around, and I will definitely come back many times again!",

I didn't care too much on the black bean sauce and the steak was a bit tough in terms of texture for a medium rare.  Well done on cooking it to perfectly medium rare though!   I adore the beer selections and service was nice.   Now, I wonder why it's named kettle black?",

The dish is classic comfort food 101. There no shortage of Jamesons and Guinness; a great no frills pub to wash down the worries of work and friendly locals.",

    "text": "Took my fiance on her first walk around in central phx this weekend, and ended up in this place. She wanted gastro pub fare, and we weren't disappointed. Kettle offered the menu and ambiance of your standard millennial fueled gastro pub, but boasted much more reasonable prices. We had the crusted ahi tuna salad, pork belly sliders, crab cakes, and bread pudding for dessert.  The portions were plentiful, prices reasonable. The pork belly itself was the best part of the meal, not too sweet and not too fatty. The crab cakes were dense with crab meat, and paired nice with the spring greens it came nestled in. The ahi tuna salad was good, but the tuna was a little over cooked (ahi tuna turns into leather in the blink of an eye). Bread pudding was classic, but had an exceptionally good texture.   I contemplated 5 stars, but the overcooked tuna was a bummer. And the bread of the pork belly slider was a little dry. Long story short, definitely recommend this place!",

I highly, highly recommend the Philly cheese steak fries (this coming from a person who typically only eats fish, chicken, turkey) and the 1st Street Burger!!!! Delicious, delicious, deliciousness!!!! Their Jerk sliders were really good too. Also their wings were really good with the mild or their sweet chilli sauce. All in all if you're looking for a place to chill and get a quick bite either during a layover or to watch a game this is the place. Less than 10-15 minutes from the airport. Quick Uber ride and worth it!!! Enjoy!!",

Me and my partner entered the restaurant around 10:15 we were quickly handed the menu and started to ask the waiter (who did not introduce himself) what would he recommend, he abruptly answered as he was walking away \"the whole menu bro\". We then looked at each other and studied the menu longer for about 15 more minutes. When he came back finally to take our orders we rushed it out because he did not stay around us long, after I placed the order I asked for a Long Island I've tea,  he walked away as he asked to see my ID (waters were not given or offered at this point either). Another ten minutes passed and  we began to realize that people around us who were sat after us had drinks and waters prepared for them. When our waiter approached us again he again asked for my Id before he started to make the drink and I reminded him that we didn't get waters. His response was (you didn't ask.) I asked for his name and he put is finger up and told me one second. Clearly he did not want to serve us and that is the vibe we felt. We travel around the world and know what great service is, we just left a 4 diamond hotel in puerto Vallarta so to experience something as insulting was highly disappointing.",

The burger is a solid choice, and the pork belly sliders are perfect both in their honey glaze, their fresh crunchy coleslaw and the crisp-yet-  chewiness of the pork belly.  The french fries are thin, and not super crisp but they're seasoned perfectly and I usually demolish them first off my plate.   They offer a selection of craft brews in addition to standard fare at the bar.  Inside it's cozy like an old British pub. There are several big tables for groups, and the place is usually quite full. Yet somehow it never feels chaotic, nor insanely crowded. It seems to me the crowds here tend to be older, in the 30s-40s-50s bracket. It feels laid back.   The staff are kind, attentive but they leave you alone to enjoy yourself too.  I am from out of town, and I probably end up here every other visit. I highly recommend it.",

Also got the pork belly sliders which hubs liked. The California club was also delicious. My only complaint? The cole slaw was warm. Not sure if it's because it was served on a hot plate? The place started getting busy but we never felt rushed by staff to leave. Oh, and good beer selection!!",

    "text": "Just let me start by saying this. Everything I like about about pub and tavern food was served up perfectly here. While traveling, I ventured out to this place on my second to last night and man am I glad that I did but let me break it down a little better.  Pro's:  -great bar with an abundance of craft beers but not so many as to be daunting. -menu is streamlined. Meaning, it WASN'T  twelve pages of poorly prepared items. It was short list of very fresh well prepared items. -manager was very present and visible. (Nothing worse than a lazy absentee manager to make feel like no one gives a crap) -Service staff while WERE busy, it seemed like there was good teamwork, and food arrived hot. -was a good happy hour crowd.  Ok....now on to the Con's  - back to the service. I felt like, if you serve craft beers you should know a little more about them other than \"its good\", or \"its popular\". - I felt as if they were working short staffed, that or it was just a very busy happy hour crowd. Other than that i cant think of anything else negative to say. This review of food was based on an order of  -fish and chips= amazing! -short ribs with creamed spaghetti squash and bacon Brussels sprouts=   very good(more like pot roast in my opinion). -hot wings= amazingly crispy! -mussels in white wine sauce with toasted herbed toast= amazing.(a meal in its own rights). -and wait for it..............the omg bread pudding with house made salted  caramel sauce. (This alone is worth making a trip to this establishment).  So if you find yourself in Phoenix AZ, you cant go wrong by coming to this place.",

There are plenty of tables, although we've never sat at one, so I can't speak to the service you receive from the wait staff.   We have always been pleased with the food here as well. My wife is obsessed with the steak salad (mainly because of the dressing), and I usually end up getting wings (mainly because they have dry rub wings), but we have had the fish and chips and a burger and all of it has been good. The prices are pretty average for downtown and it's close to the sports venues which is nice.",

DO try the whisky/scotch menu. It's got good stuff from America, Scotland/Ireland, and even Japan. Stuff that will knock you off your socks.   DO try the bar food, like the variations of chips. Especially Philly steak fries. They even give you two forks so you can pretend you won't try to eat it alone.   Also, watch soccer here! I enjoyed my World Cup viewing experience, and how they opened up extra early for the huge party I was in. During actual club season, it's a Manchester City bar.   Good eats, libations, and service all around, but keep in mind it's a bit compact. Seating can get cramped, and there aren't any diversions like billiards or darts here, which coupled with the lack of a patio make it feel like more of a chill spot than a place you could spend hours in partying it up. Nevertheless, totally worth an unwavering recommendation.",

Hefty price for just ok food.",

    "text": "Irish pub located walking distance of Talking Stick Arena became a focal point for the night as we were looking to get a good bite to eat and previously tried this after seeing the Bruno Mars concert just weeks before.  The atmosphere is cool with televisions around, high top tables & chairs, along with a bar with just about everything you would expect from a pub.  On the menu we had the Philly cheesesteak fries and buffalo chicken fries as appetizers and for the main course we got a range of things from the salmon, the chicken club sandwich, the bacon onion marmalade burger and something else (Club sandwich I think)  Everyone enjoy their food however I was a little bit throne as the bacon onion marmalade was not what I expected. Granted, I could've just gotten bacon on the side for just a little more $ but decided to just stick with what they were doing and give it a try. The burger was cooked well however the bread that came with it was like a brioche type & seemed like it was at its last day & a bit stale.   I asked for the marmalade on the side so I was able to finish the 2nd half of the burger with some delete.  I had a bit of the salmon and it was excellent. Along with dinner I had a few Moscow Mules that helped. Been twice and everything has been good but not a fan of the burger/marmalade combo. If your. It a marmalade fan, get it on the side to try. Will come back and try some other stuff as the service was prompt & drinks were on point!",

    "text": "A little disappointed with this one. We went here prior to going to try out the escape room. The yelp reviews were pretty high and I am assuming the people who suggested it were high as well. It would appear to be an Irish pub. They have Guinness and all of the decor is a pinterest version of what a man cave should look like with an Irish theme. The menu is limited as well as the beers they have on tap. I guess they assumed having Guinness and Fish and Chips plus some Irish swag makes it an Irish pub. I ordered a Buffalo Trace Manhattan and they brought me the drink without the cherry and it didn't quite taste like a Manhattan. I asked the waitress where the cherry was and she told me the bartender does not make a Manhattan the normal way. I asked her politely if I could have it the normal way. She told me to just try it. So I just drank it. I do have to say the buffalo chicken fries were pretty good. I ordered the southwest chicken wrap for dinner. It was pretty much solid lettuce in a tortilla and was lacking flavor. The lettuce had been washed apparently fairly recently which would explain why it was watery. Honestly this place has an energy in it, but it has more to do with people in the place than the place itself. This really is a really very poor impression of Seamus McCaffrey's. If you like Irish pub's maybe try one where they do it the normal way, seriously try Seamus McCaffrey's instead.",

The food was above average for a pub. I did like that they had options other than the typical fish and chip fare most pubs tote. The dishes were creative and tasty but still affordable and they did have the fish and chip fare still if that's what you wanted! The ambiance was relly enjoyable and I liked the lower ceilings, darkened feel and the way the booths and tables were situated. This place honestly is great for dinner and it would be great for a happy hour or start of a night out with friends. The only suggestion I would make would be to beef up the draft beer list. The only craft beers on tap when we went were Sculpin, Racer 5, and a San Tan IPA. I could have just been unlucky, but I was definitely expecting more draft beer depth.",

We order two beers. They were literally overflowing as they were brought to the table. When they were sat down there was beer everywhere. They didn't even bother to clean it up. The food we ordered took 40 minutes. We asked for a coke, no ice, and it was brought with ice after we reminded the waiter twice for the drink. The food had obviously been sitting for a while as it was cold. It shouldn't have taken that long. It was a California club and fish and chips. I wouldn't return. Food was good.

It was one of the best burgers I've ever had.   Shared the Philly cheesesteak fries. So. Good.   Not a huge beer selection but the ones they had were local and good.  Will def be back!",

My friend had been there once before, ordered the steak salad, loved it, and ordered it again when we went. I dipped my pinkie in her dressing and it was divine - she was done when I did that.  I ordered the ahi tuna salad. There are few restaurant salads that impress me - particularly at a self-proclaimed \"pub,\" but this one definitely did! It was so delicious, and, long story short, I could eat it all day, every day. I tend to order the same thing when I find something as delicious as that salad, but I hope I can convince myself to branch out the next time we go there for lunch.",

I will now make it a point to stop here any time we are in Phoenix simply for the pretzel. We stopped here for a business dinner while on a trip to Phoenix. They have some decent craft drinks but the main focus at this pub is obviously the beer. I opted for a specialty cocktail in which I cannot remember the name but it was something with gin and fruit and it was delish. For dinner, I went with fish n chips that was below average. The batter was soggy and the fish was poor quality. It tasted as though they left it sitting for too long after frying it. Service that night was slow and we had to grab our servers attention a few times so don't expect anything more. But my God, that pretzel made up for it all!",

My son-in-law got a Bacon Onion Burger and a coke. It all came to $39.64.   fries arrived in five mins  Our meals arrived eight mins later. The bread on my Club was toasted and as long as you have avocado on it, it will fall apart, which it did. Good potential for this meal but the side dish (fries) was better than the entree. Sad.

The service was good. Our server even told jokes and did a trick with the catsup bottle. So if nothing else, we were entertained. The corned beef and cabbage didn't have a lot of flavor, and the fish and chips were also pretty bland. I'd choose somewhere else.",

We first had the buffalo chicken fries for our starter, and let me tell you, it was delicious! My boyfriend got the California club, and I got the Bacon onion burger. His was supper good, he loved it, and of course I took a bite of his, the best club I ever had. My burger was super juicy and tasty. I wish i had another. For dessert we got the bread pudding and let me tell you that sh*t was so freaking good. Like it just melts in your mouth as our waiter Michael ( hope that's the right way to spell it ) said \" caramel pancakes \" and he was spot on with that. I would definitely come back here again and tell my friends and family about it. :)",

Granted we said our complaints and the waiter did fix his mean and took my drink off the bill. Also Not once did a manager come ask us how or service was.

They had a decent beer selection and we did a pretty killer car bomb. The car bomb cost less than the less tasty cocktails. My advice, come for the atmosphere and the beer...skip the cocktails.",

The servers Mikeal, Misty, Kelsey, and Jen were phenomenal!!! They were all sweet, helpful, and personable, which is something that is too often missed with businesses these days. The GM and owner were not only present, but also serving the clients and both came to talk to me individually and ensured everything was going well!           Second, the food and the beer they had on tap were excellent!! I requested recommendations from the employees and each item was great; (philly fries, fish and chips, Stone IPA and Raj)!!!!             I will be traveling to downtown Phoenix frequently for business and they have earned a loyal customer each and every time I return!   P.S. They also have free wifi!   Thanks again, Kettle Black!",

Patrons consist mostly of 30's to 60 somethings, mostly white collars after lunch, Theater goers, convention goers, and post game fans. Lay out consist of a long bar, long bench table in the middle and booth seats along the wall.  Price: On the high end but this is a classy place so I don't mind if it keeps the place classy. There are plenty of places for the post college crowd and the hipster crowed in Phoenix.  Service: Always well taken care off. The owner keeps adequate staff to keep patrons glasses full.  Food:  Not your typical bar grub, menu includes nice selection of salads (seared tuna salad, Citrus Asian Chicken) as well as your typical favorites; Burgers, fish and chips etc.  Summary: A classy old school Irish pub where you can enjoy a gentlemanly pint!",

Three out of our party of four ordered beef burgers and raved.  I had the turkey burger and it was pretty good, a tiny bit dry but the onion roll grilled with butter and the other fixins rounded it out and it worked very well.  Truffle fries won the majority vote.  Never knew teenage girls would appreciate a sophisticated burger but they surprised me with their mature palates. Atmosphere, service and decor all added to the kitchens hands-work, one of the party of four did notice that there were not one black kettle in sight. Although we live a bit out of the way to be regulars, we would definitely  come back on another trip downtown.",

Thankfully, Kettle Black popped up with the best Yelp! reviews around. After perusing the menu online, I gave them a quick ring to confirm that their kitchen was open late. From the moment we arrived to the time we left, we were treated as True guests. Despite walking in with six and the place being quite full, they were able to seat us quickly in a corner booth. The menu offerings are an inspired step-up from your typical pub-grub with reimagined flavors and delicious sides which really hit the spot! Don't miss their full bar and impressive draft selections. We're already looking forward to our next visit!",

I was originally trying to make my way to bitter and twisted a block or so away but saw this first as I exited the cityscape parking garage (I was only visiting for a couple days) so I just decided to go here instead and I'm glad I did. It's a really relaxed place with a great drink menu. I sat at the bar and started with the house drink - kettle black and an order of wings, half garlic butter and half spicy. The wings were nice and crispy but the sauces were nothing super special. The drink though, it was delicious. I got another drink called Broken China because the bartender recommended it and the steak salad with a spicy Caesar dressing. Both were great. It's kind of pricey but pretty much what you'd expect to spend at a bar on a night out. The bartender was really friendly too. Definitely recommend!",

Arrived during happy hour, but the drinks are only a buck off as my Guinness was now down to $6. They did have some good happy hour food deals, but we went straight to the main course. The burger, which I tried, was terrific (1st street burger?) with lots of quality toppings, but the Rueben might have stolen the show. They hand brine the corned beef in-house and then slice it and that is the start of the rueben. Usually, corned beef is chewy, but in this case it almost melted in my mouth and the blanket of saeurkraut and swiss cheese made this a very pleasant eating experience. The waitress with tats was very nice and also the fries are handcut and tasty. Small patio for people watching is a bonus. Good stop pre-game or pre-show.",

The place is large, clean and just noisy enough to have good energy without being so loud that you can't have a conversation.  P.S.  The bathroom was clean.",

My friends were already there and grabbed a booth, so I met them inside.  Cool little place!  I'm cutting carbs, so I went with an order of their wings.  Normally, $11.00, but it was Happy Hour, so they were only $7.00.  Score!  About 10 decent sized wings.  I ordered them \"extra crispy\", and while crisp, I would have preferred another minute or so in the fryer.  Sauce was good, ranch was good, celery sticks were good.  For $7.00, it was a deal!  My friends ordered some mussels and the fish and chips.  It looked tasty, and they seemed to like it.  Service was on point!  There wasn't a minute that went by without someone checking on you or refilling your waters and what have you.  I was impressed.  Only bad thing I can say about the place is that the floor was SUPER slippery.  I headed back to the restroom, and almost slipped twice.  Walk SLOWLY!  Vibe was cool, menu looked great (when my diet is over, I would definitely like to check out some of their food), and the price was very good for happy hour.  I could definitely see myself coming back here before a game.",

We decided to do the lamb gyro and the fish and chips.  Both were great choices!  The Lamb gyro felt fresh and tasty in a different way.  The gyro meat was not the typical shaved shawarma meat you normally expect, it was more like a hamburger/ground beef style.  I had never had a gyro like this one before but I did like it.  The veggies and sauce were great too-everything came together well and it was served with your choice of fries, salad, pasta salad and i went for the pasta salad.  This was tasty!  My husband's fish and chips dish was also great.  Crispy fresh fish and nicely seasoned fries.  We left as happy campers!",

I stumbled into this place while in town for business, trying to escape the 100+ degree heat. Thank God it wasn't a mirage. It was a real oasis.   Plain and simple: I loved the cozy/rustic decor, my burger was great, and they have Magner's on tap. I was able to order a light beer, a dark beer, and some cole slaw to slap on top of my burger. It was all great and I left happy. The location is very convenient as well. I would swing by again if in the area. Thanks, Kettle Black.",

    "text": "This FIVE STAR review is for one of the servers at The Kettle Black. His name is Stephen. My car broke down outside of The Kettle Black on Wednesday afternoon while it was 110 degrees outside. I had my 7 year old daughter with me and we had to call a tow truck. While we were waiting outside in the 110 degree heat for the tow truck to come (which somehow took 90 minutes), Stephen saw us and came outside and invited us to wait inside where it was cool. He also gave me a glass of ice water and my daughter a glass of lemonade. I offered to pay and he refused. The world needs more people like Stephen in it! He made a bad situation a little more bearable. Thank you to The Kettle Black and THANK YOU STEPHEN!",

We had a pretty large party to seat but though they said they don't tend to do reservations on nights that a concert is going on nearby, they worked it out for us. We had a lot of appetisers, beers and dishes, and despite being completely packed that night, the staff was attentive, friendly and super on it the whole night. It's a wonderful pub to get food and drinks with friends and have a good time!",

The bread pudding is probably the most amazing bread pudding I have ever had. I love their crab cakes... like love love love.... The burgers are pretty decadent, but lacks flavor. I use a lot of the garlic aioli ... their fries are really good- I drown them in the garlic aoli or the curry sauce. Overall, it is always nice to end my artsy fartsy evenings there.   The interior is like an Irish bar had a baby with a hipster.  The food is like sporty gastropub meets young hipster chef.  So basically it is a young hipster chef who likes sports and is Irish.",

Since we're talking managers. I've gotta message for this one. Man you've gotta chill! I think he chugged some red bulls, because he was around pretty frantically. Don't get me wrong, super nice, probably gave me about seven arm squeezes...but simmer down please.  We both ordered the tequila mojito cocktail equivalent. Way too sweet. Should've listened to the bartender when he said he didn't like the cocktail list. There was a lot of fried dishes on the menu. So we opted for the chicken kebab for a splash of healthiness. It was awesome the chicken was moist, and the green beans on the dish were drenched in heavenly garlic. The Pork Belly Sliders were not as grand. The meat was overdone and it didn't melt in your mouth like that fatty slider demanded. The sweet Chile sauce was a bit too sweet. I'll be back though, plenty more dishes to try.",

Exciting, second, for offering another lunch alternative. Exciting. third, for being a spot I'll be taking people when showing off DTPHX.  So, I've been here a few times, traveled around the menu and must say I've had several good meals. While partial to the fish and chips, the burgers have been solid. And I simple LOVE the soft pretzel. Like, engagement ceremony love it.  While I've never had a drink here (I quit drinking last year), their selection of whiskeys looks impressive.

Pork belly sliders a solid choice as well. They look small but are super filling and flavorful. The chicken kebabs are good too, and a great option when you're trying to be a bit healthier.

It's cozy with great music  We're craft beers drinkers and the staff behind the bar was extremely knowledgeable and offered us tastes.  Other venues near the downtown area scoff when you ask for a taste. One ale house charges after a few tastes.  I digress. Food was okay but not sensational but no complaints.  Enjoyed this visit.",

    "text": "My husband and I were in Downtown Phoenix and we wanted to try a new place, the Kettle Black Kitchen seemed like a great place to get a beer. It was quite early so there was not that many people in the restaurant. The inside is very nice, there is a great Irish pub feel-like. The decoration of the place is well done, I love the bar itself.  We actually sat at the bar and ordered a Stella, the keg was empty (not the bartender's fault of course). We had to wait quite a while for our first beer, but no big deal. Then later on, my husband ordered a second beer and to our surprise the bartender pour the rest of the pitcher of Stella in my husband's glass.. She actually used that pitcher at least 20 minutes before to get the keg started, she poured all the foam in the pitcher ... Why would you serve that pitcher into a glass for a customer when it had been sitting outside for quite a while already.. Of course the beer was flat so my husband had to order a new one.. That's probably why I am not giving them 5 stars, not very professional. We got the Curry Fries, the fries themselves were very good however their homemade curry sauce tasted more like a soup..  Overall it was a nice place, we will be back for a drink and maybe try a main course or something. Hopefully, the Stella keg won't be empty!",

They have a blackboard with  \"Craft beers\" but they really only have the standard Stone on tap and nothing too exciting in bottles either.  The food is pretty mediocre.  Not really would I consider gastropub fare.  The fish & chips came with the blandest coleslaw I've ever eaten and the chips needed life support.  I didn't even dare try what I could only guess was tartar sauce.  My buddy had a wrap which he described as meh.  The staff was nice enough but not nice enough for me to go back.",

My sister and I walked in and were immediately greeted by a cute, upbeat young man who pointed out a couple places that were available to sit. We picked the bar. We were served right away and given menus. So far so good. Then a gentlemen, the bartender, Jessy, came over and we ordered.... I guess \"a lot of food\" - okay - whatever- we wanted to try a few things- our prerogative. We had a good laugh about \"how much food we ordered\" which as an app and two entrees. Mr. Bartender, Jessy, who at this point, I decided to make small talk with because I wanted to know why he seemed a bit tense, glad I did because he does have a nice smile- when he shows it and makes a great cocktail. Don't be afraid of this guy - get him to smile and you are set... Anyway....Our food came and it was PERFECTO- loved it! For as busy it was, it was served quickly and hot. Key factors for me! We ate our food and only ate enough to save room for dessert!  Told Jessy we need MORE food and ordered our bead pudding! I laughed - he didn't - but whatever- it was served HOT and was amazeballs (yes- amazeballs) - we had one more cocktail... At which point the cute, upbeat young man that greeted us came by to ask how everything was- I told him how great it was that he was the social representative of the place- he informed us he was one of the partners. Made small talk with Harrison and told him we were quite impressed with our first visit here and added that even Jessy's mysterious personality was fun and we had fun seeing who could get him to flash his smile.   Alas, the final words on my review- definitely hit this place up when u are in Downtown - you won't be disappointed - the atmosphere, food, drinks and people there are great- This will be my go to place in downtown from now on! Lastly- make sure to say hi to Jessy and get him to smile!",

I enjoy going there for lunch, however it is not the time to have alcoholic beverages. They need to upgrade their soft drinks. If they are unable to used filtered water for the soft drinks the maybe have the option of having them canned or bottled. Even if I was there for an adult beverage I would probably stay away from the mixed drinks. But otherwise the food is excellent.",

We dinned here three days while staying across the street at the Renaissance Hotel. The first two meals were good. The third day I ordered an arugula salad which was brown and tasted old. I ate a few pieces of blue cheese and candied nuts then pushed it aside and shared my husband's lunch with him. When the waiter took the full salad away I mentioned the greens were brown, limp and old tasting, to which he replied \"oh\". So I repeated myself. The greens in that salad have gone bad. So he said \"okay I'll let him\". When he came back with the bill I asked him if he had told the owner/chef and he said \"yes\" and started to walk away. I said \"what did he say, too bad\"? The waiter said \"yes\".  Suddenly I was reminded of the show \"Bar Rescue\". Grossed out completely, I wondered how complaisantly the rest of the kitchen was being managed.  Let me say, the greens on my husbands side salad (not arugula) looked very fresh. Upon making the salad, I don't know why the cook didn't offer me the fresh greens in place of the arugula. Funny how a restaurant/bar owner can get so hung up on himself that he would risk a bad review and \"surprise kitchen inspection\" just to save his 3 dollar cost of goods in making it right with the customer. We will not return on our scheduled trips to Phoenix.",

The food was very good. We started with the truffle fries (we weren't going to get them but then we saw someone walk by with them and we had to try them) and they were very good. Nice and crispy! We got the steak salad and the bacon onion burger, but very good as well. The salad was the perfect size if you were thinking about that bread pudding which we highly recommend. That bread pudding alone is reason enough to stop through.   They did seem a little under staffed for a Saturday, but everyone was very friendly and helpful when they stopped by our booth!",

Waiter said that they \"technically turned into a bar\" at 10pm and no children were allowed. It was 10:20 just after a Phoenix Suns game. I called ahead to make sure they were still serving food not at all thinking that I needed to ask if my daughter was allowed in the restaurant. Anyway, as soon as the waiter started in with this BS speech we bolted for the door. Curious, as I have never been told to leave a restaurant because I have my daughter with me, I googled the Arizona liquor laws. Sure enough, turns out Kettle Black was just discriminating against parents with kids. Their \"not good for kids\" description really means \"stay out if you have kids.\" I've had a Yelp account for many years now. Obviously, there have been other instances where I did not receive great service. This is the first time I have ever been motivated to voice my displeasure.",

I've had plenty of burgers here trying to find the one Phoenix beefy, gourmet masterpiece that is a GastroPub burger and I've finally found my edible Unicorn. Rehab Burger, Delux and Rocket Burger have been my top until now and they do a fairly awesome job (top mention to my Main Slab Rocket Burger) but this place blows them out of the water. Tender, juicy, flavorful and complimented by the freshest toppings, this burger is THE BEST BURGER IN ARIZONA. If you feel differently, feel free to message me because if you know one better than here I have to try it to believe it.   For those from Los Angeles think along the lines of Father's office, Black Sheep and Vaka burger. Yeah, that good.   My boyfriend had fish and chips and I was surprised at how delicious it was (I don't usually like fish). It was ridiculously fresh. And the soup of the day (corn beef and cabbage) was magnificent. Honestly, not one thing we tasted was even kind of a dissapointment. Everything was so flavorful.   As for everything else, the ambienece was great, the beer was fresh and hoppy and the waiters were sweet as hell. Our waitress didn't even seem bothered by my constant indecisiveness (everything looked so delicious I changed my order a couple of times).   This is going to be a new regular spot for us. It cures my case of the homesick and then some.",

Tom and Harry run a great operation with great service and delicious food. It may be the middle of the summer, but I couldn't resist ordering the Guinness braised short ribs--and it was no mistake. So delicious! All four of us ordered something different, and none of us were disappointed. If you're anywhere nearby--definitely check this place out.",

    "text": "Sorry Kettle Black.  You won't ever see me again.    An \"Irish Pub\" that offers Philly Cheese Steak?  Didn't want to even try it.    My friend ordered a Rueben Sandwich would have sent any True Jew running into the streets screaming.  Gordon Ramsey, where are you when we need you?   Want a really good Rueben?  You can find it in the most unimaginable and unlikely place in town - Village Inn.  A great Rueben sandwich.  I ordered fish and chips.  Dreadful.   At least it was cod.  The lump of fish  should have been sliced thin before battering and frying.  The batter did not stick to the fish and it was a chore just to try to get it into my mouth without it falling off my fork.  I think this is also an indication that the frying oil was not being hot enough.  The fries were good though after being doused with salt and malt vinegar.  One of our group ordered Crab Cakes and loved them.  OK, one brownie point.  Another ordered the Ahi Tuna salad.  It seemed OK but was nothing special and could have been duplicated in over 100 Phoenix eateries.  Did they offer a large selection of craft beers?  Yes, but after the mediocre food who cares?  Not me.",

Service was friendly, I went for a late lunch so not too busy.  Atmosphere was comfortable.  I imagine this would be a great place to enjoy a pint.  Check it out.  Only drawback was the cobbler on Yelp was off the menu may head back to try it again.  Enjoy!!!",

However, we were told to wait at the bar when we came because everything was full (although it wasn't). Then we sat at a table and about 5 mins later, we were told there was a reservation for that table (which sat less than 10) in the next 45 mins so we could either sit there and have to move when the reservation comes or we could move to another table now. We moved to another table which actually was someone else's & they ended up leaving because their space was given to us. The service was very slow. We seemed to have to flag our server down when we needed something.   The food was really great though. Our table ordered the Philly cheese steak fries and hot wings. They both were excellent. I ordered the wasabi chicken Caesar salad, which was also great. I'm a Caesar dressing snob and they definitely delivered.   We came towards the end of happy hour and were able to get some drinks in, which ended up being pretty good. Our server was not very knowledgeable of their drinks or that it was even still happy hour!   The prices are fair. The restaurant itself is pretty small. Overall, the food saved this experience because otherwise I would have left due to the poor service.",

I have to be honest, it was bland, very bland. It sounded like it'd be bursting with flavor but I don't know, there was nothing to it, it had no flavor in anything. I had to throw a fair amount of ketchup to just get something out of it. I was really underwhelmed. The fires were very good. I felt like if they would have added some seasoning to the burger ingredients it would have been wonderful but it was like salt and pepper went missing. I was really sad because it looked and sounded really good.

I was a bit cynical since I wanted to eat across the street. There was a small patio outside but we wanted to be indoors.   The minute we walked in I knew the hubs had made the right choice. It's our kind of place. There were booths, a very nice area, wood in enough places to add warmth and a cozy factor. From the get go, it just felt good to be there.   Our server was quick to come over and offered a sample of a craft brew from a local brewery I'd never heard of. Tasty!  We were a bit early for dinner so we ordered from the lunch menu. Nice variety here. Salads, sandwiches, and more.   Full disclosure: I am NOT a sandwich person. Not at all. Burgers yes, sandwich no. But, the chicken sandwich on a ciabatta roll with avocado, bacon and some delicious mayo concoction on the side was absolutely the BEST sandwich I've ever eaten. I am serious. Every mouthful was pure goodness. The best!  My side salad was fresh and the bleu cheese dressing and large chunks of cheese which I promptly savored. Yum!   Another server tempted us with the bread pudding. Hmmm...do we dare? Remember I said indulgence was the goal, so glad we caved. Deliciously decadent and we loved every single bite.    I think The Kettle Black will now have to be on the list where we take out of town guests and it will be our our regular list too!  Great service, cool place. A new date night place for us for sure.",

    "text": "We had originally stopped at another bar restaurant for dinner but I felt like I didn't want to eat there and saw that this place was right around the corner so we came here instead. Huge improvement!   We start sat ourselves at the bar and the bartender helped us which I was impressed with because he was also filling all the other drink orders for the bar as well. We ordered two beers which he poured immediately and helped us with some questions with the menu. We ended up ordering the pretzel and the black bean burger. The pretzel came with a cheese dip and a crushed mustard seed dip. What I liked about the pretzel was that it stayed soft even after the pretzel had cooled off. Usually, they get hard. The cheese was phenomenal. It was creamy and a restrained cheese flavor that was good. I also dipped my fries into it. I'm not a super mustard person so not comments there. The black bean burger was good. The patty was nice and moist with really good flavor. I would describe the overall flavor of the burger as comparable to a really good meatless chili. I love meat and I enjoyed the burger so there's that. I really liked this place and would definitely come back.",

    "text": "How to describe The Kettle.  Its owned by a couple of Irish ex-pats, but its not an Irish pub per se.  The contemporary Victorian style interior might trick you into believing this could be a British pub, but no its not that either.  There's plenty of TVs at the bar, so is it a sports bar?  However you wanna describe The Kettle, its most certainly a pub unique to Downtown.  I had the The Kettle on my to do list for awhile and I figured I'd come in the middle of happy hour on a Tuesday, expecting a light crowd and a chance to soak it all in.  The Kettle is located next door to La Piazza PHX (an excellent Downtown pizza joint) just north of Washington on 1st Street.  When I came in just before 5pm, I had expected to grab a seat alongside a light afternoon crowd.  To my absolute astonishment, the place was packed.  Kettle's convenient location to much of the Downtown work crowd would at least partially explain this, but a full house in a restaurant that seats upwards of 80 people?  On a Tuesday?  Before 5?  With no concert or game scheduled that night?  Holy moly.  I actually arrived just as a seat at the end of the bar was opening up so I fortunately didn't have to wait.  Once planted in the corner, I went to work.  As I said, the place is owned by a couple of Irish ex-pats (Jimmy Culleton and Tom Montgomery), and they clearly were looking to put their own spin on a European-style pub.  No bangers and mash or corned beef and cabbage here, no sir (okay there is fish and chips, but I digress).  In fact the grub here overwhelmingly American in influence.  With bar food classics like pretzels, wings, and fries with different toppings, as well as main dishes like burgers, chicken sandwiches, and even mac and cheese.  The beer selection for the day is on the chalkboard up front and their cocktail list is available upon request.  I started with the The Kettle Black's signature cocktail.  Appropriately named...The Kettle Black.  Bushmills Whiskey (from Ireland of course), Cointreau Noir (basically an orange flavored French Cognac), Orange Juice, Lemon Juice, and Cinnamon.  Refreshing drink with no almost aftertaste, though I'll admit the strength of the alcohol slowly became pronounced after awhile.  For my main dish, I said burger me.  Given the options at my disposal, the Bacon Onion Burger was simply too tempting to pass up.  Swiss cheese, bacon, caramelized onions, a bacon-onion marmalade, garlic aioli, lettuce and tomato.  Served with fries and a side of ranch.  I will say the burger wasn't as huge as I thought it would be (other Yelp photos I saw of this burger made it look ginormous), but a really good hearty burger and I loved the marmalade on this thing.  The fries were a nice compliment too as they were cooked well done on the outside, but retained a nice chewy texture inside.  For dessert, I went with the Apple Crumble.  This version was topped with vanilla gelato and a cranberry gastrique.   The portion size of this dessert was quite large and could easily be shared by two.  The soft, warm crumble soaked up that gelato just right and the combo of apple and cranberry flavors worked perfectly.  Total cost for the cocktail, main entree, dessert, tax and tip came to about $40.  The food itself was pretty reasonably priced, though the cocktail was a little bit pricey for the size at $12.  I will say the service I received was a little bit slow.  There were two bartenders working the front and it was pretty clear the one I got was still learning the ropes (didn't catch his name).  His counterpart by comparison was a machine, cranking out drinks, conversing with the bar patrons, and keeping his station organized with almost military precision.  My guy had a little bit of trouble keeping organized which meant I had to wait a bit in between meals.  Not a huge deal though as I'm sure he'll get the hang of it.  The front bar was full of regulars (primarily Downtown workers) from all age groups.  Great pub atmosphere for conversation, people watching, and to let your hair down.  Call it a pub, call it a sports bar, call it a lounge, call it whatever you want.  I call it a welcome addition to the neighborhood.",

When they filled it before cutting it, I  assure you that they pilled it in the middle so when they cut it in the middle...chicken showed (see photo) but still no avocado...boo!  Now, that being said my friends had Medium Wings with Ranch, and scarfed them down...she loved them. She said the Ranch was real good, not thick and goopey. My other friend had the Bacon Onion Burger and loved it too.   The fries for the me were the saving grace and the pretzel.

First, we got lucky and walked in (party of 3) on a Saturday around 6:30 and only waited 5 minutes. Staff was on it and prompt and constantly checking in on us despite being packed. Shout out to Mikael (pronounced Michael) for being a 5 star server and helping me make my decision between the 4 things I was eyeing.   I went with the jerk chicken sliders per his suggestion. Those two sliders were juicy, flavorful & the buns were so soft. It didn't taste like jerk sauce but I still loved it. I ordered a side salad but they gave me fries as a mistake. They never caught it and I didn't complain because they were crispy & seasoned.   My party ordered the fish & chips and their house burger and everyone was satisfied. They had a full bar and only a few beers on tap but everyone ordered what they wanted. The place has a cool dark vibe and the music isn't too loud which we appreciated. There was a overly drunk guy they took outside but this didn't ruin my experience! Right in the middle of downtown- a must!",

My only complaint is that it is always too damn busy.   This popular establishment has excellent food. I have been here many times and there are too many satisfying items to name them all, but I have to give a nod to two stand outs. Their soft pretzel is top notch and accompanied by a fantastic cheese dip. The really stellar item however is the scallop dish. Phoenix is of course known for its fresh seafood--or maybe not, but this has not hindered KB from serving one of the best scallop dishes that I have ever had. Perfectly seared scallops are served on a bed of spinach and parsnip puree; the whole thing then drizzled with a slightly spicy reduction. They deftly walk the tightrope of strong and complex flavors that still allow the delicate taste of the scallop to shine through. I actually ordered this dish two nights in a row, something I don't think I have ever done before in my life.",

He named a couple items but the first one he raddled off was the Rueben so that's what I went with (hold the 1000 island because I'm not a fan of mayo). I got it with the side salad and balsamic.  The sandwich was very good. A decent about of corned beef, a good amount of cheese and not too much sauerkraut.   Thanks for letting me hang out while I waited for family to get in from the airport!",

There is a pub/tavern like feel with a bar, booths, and communal tables. We were waited on right away and our waitress was great.  I ordered the turkey burger with fries. The burger was very flavorful, cooked well, and had fresh toppings with it. My husband ordered the pork belly sliders which came on Hawaiian rolls with fries.   We both really enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere. We sat and enjoyed our drinks for quite a while before leaving. If we're ever back in the area we'll certainly have this on our list!",

We came in on a busy Saturday afternoon and had a couple of drinks and a couple of the appetizers. I ordered some Honey Hot chicken wings and she got the pretzel, and I ordered an IPA to wash down my wings. The service was adequate for how busy they were, and it gave us time to chat while we checked out the decor - which definitely has the English Pub vibe. The wings were pretty good, but I really enjoyed the pretzel - the mustard was phenomenal. I decided to order the fish and chips too, and my only gripe with that was the large size of the fish. I prefer smaller pieces rather than one giant piece, I guess I'm a breading fiend. Beer selection was great, I didn't have a hard time finding a beer that I wanted to drink.   I will come back to throw back some beers and grab some grub at this place, but I think it would be a better place to go with some of my buddies rather than my fiancee. I'll put it on my pregame stop list when any of my friends come up from Tucson to catch a game downtown.",

It's not like a fish and chips in London but you will not get better fish and chips anywhere in Arizona and what I had here. The fish was very fresh and tasty and crunchy and the chips were probably the best I've ever had. If you haven't been here you've got to try this out it's amazing.",

I don't know when I will find myself in Phoenix next, but I will enjoy again before I go and make it a must next time I visit. Crab cakes and steak salad were delicious - looking forward to trying some other tasty business! Awesome place, will return.",

This was an excellent choice !the crisp batter was delectable, French fries were delicious and there was an okay slaw on the side. I ended up ordering a Stone IPA, even though it is not local, it's a well know craft from one state west. We saw other plates come out, burgers look like a great choice and we also witnessed the \"pretzel\"- wishing I had tried that. It's a casual atmosphere, open to the outdoors (you can eat outside too). Very welcoming staff, including a manager or owner(?) who stopped by to ask about our experience. It's a must stop if you're in the downtown area , out for a b-ball game, etc. Fresh, delicious, cozy.",

    "text": "The Kettle Black is a new restaurant that recently opened on 1st street in downtown Phoenix. When I initially saw the menu and photos of the place I was excited to try it out. I thought it would be a nice addition to the restaurants in the area.  Unfortunately I was not impressed with anything here. The staff was very nice and the atmosphere was accommodating but I found the food and vibe to be extraordinary boring. I think a more succinct way to summarize this restaurant is: generic. There is nothing particularly interesting or different about this place, which means I will not go back.  We visited on a Thursday night and the place was surprisingly busy. There were only a few tables available which I took as a good sign. The music was... strange. I heard several 90's alternative techno remixes, this is a detail that may or may not be useful to you (it certainly is to me).  I can overlook a restaurant being boring or uninspired if the food is really good, however, this was a let-down also. I ordered the 1st Street Burger, it was served on a small cutting board... I'm not sure why, this \"fun\" idea became immediately impractical as I had to contain all of the drippings on a very small/localized area. The burger itself reminded me of something you would order at a chain restaurant such as a Chilli's or Applebees and that may be the crowd they're targeting with their proximity to the stadium.   The one bright spot were the truffle fries, if I were 4-5 drinks in I may be convinced to return for another round of these.   The Kettle is Whack, stay away.",

Others at the table had fish and chips, and pork belly sliders. Didn't try there's but they said they were both great. The scallops were large enough and very meaty. Appetizers of crab cakes and Humus were also very good. This spot is now on my radar. Very convenient to Talking Stick Arena, Chase Field, Convention Center.

Good prices for good food, friendly staff, and a decent selection of beer. Great to hang out with coworkers or for some relaxing happy hour time with friends.  I had the crab cakes and SO had the chicken sandwich which we were both satisfied with. Worth a visit, and maybe a repeat.",

Our server was good though, friendly and attentive.  The mussels were bland and the beer selection our server listed off was kinda boring. :\\ I do want to come back and try their fish and chips sometime though.",

    "text": "I live downtown, so I have a lot of choices for bars, but the Kettle Black is rapidly becoming my favorite pub in all of downtown.  Everyone is incredibly friendly, from the bartenders to the owners to the servers to the patrons. This is what keeps me coming back, and recommending it to others. I've pulled in regulars from other bars, various local friends, my daughter and her fiance, and even friends from Tempe who took the light rail just to try it. Everyone loves this friendly place.  I've only tried a couple of menu items - the fish & chips and the Philly cheese fries - but both were quite good. The food prices are reasonable and a very good value.  My go-to drink is Jameson rocks, but they don't even pick on me when I back it with an Ultra instead of one of the real beers they have on tap. Drink prices are normal for downtown, and service is always quick.  I like bars, and I've visited this one well over a dozen times since it opened a month or so ago. Downtown needed a place like this: just a cool, friendly, relaxing place to hang out. Doesn't matter if you live downtown or are visiting for a game, show, convention, whatever. Hit the Kettle Black. You won't regret it.  And if you see a guy with a beard sipping a Jamo rocks and an Ultra, come say hi.",

    "text": "Ah man I was real disappointed in this place.  I've been wanting to come here forever it feels like.  Finally popped in on a Saturday evening around 8-9ish.  The place was packed and although a lot smaller than I had envisioned it had a dope feel to it.  We were seated near the front by the servers POS (odd spot to put it right where customers walk in but who am I to judge).  Our server was friendly and helped us with drinks right away.    I ordered the Kettle Black drink and fish n chips.  The drinks took a long time to come out.  We sat around forever.  Unfortunately, the table next to us were 3 20 something year old ghetto catty girls and an older boring looking dude looking to score.  The ghetto talk went on and on about how one of them left the other one at some sports event and how drunk she was and couldn't believe she left her with her other friend that she introduced her to in the first place.  On and on and on.  I was ready to leave both of them in the desert by the time our drinks finally arrived.  The drink was tasty but short and jam packed with ice.  The fish n chips came out shortly later.  The fish was tasty but one small piece.  The fries were soggy and limp.  The coleslaw was super sweet.  We ate the fish, some of the soggy chips, ditched the candy coleslaw and heard the rest of the conversation unfold.  We honestly couldn't wait to get the hell out of here.  Check finally arrived and we bounced out as quickly as we could.  Perhaps it was the fact we were smashed against the other customers and they wouldn't shut the hell up and that accounted for some of the disappointment.   Not sure but wouldn't come out of my way to return and not a recommend at this point.",

I opted for the bacon burger with french fries. After reading some of the other reviews I was really looking forward to it. But to be honest I wasn't that impressed with it. It was OK but I've had much better burgers at other places. I had asked for medium rare and it came out a definite medium. The fries were good; however they could have been cooked a little longer in my opinion. One of the ladies I was with ordered the vegetable soup and was quite surprised to find chunks of chicken in it. This was quite a surprise as she's a vegetarian. The waitress was very apologetic and did end up taking it off her bill however.",

The bartender recommended the Pork Belly Sliders with fries. Excellent choice! The Pork Belly Sliders are honey sriracha glazed with Asian slaw, and wasabi mayo. A ton of flavor and filling. Comes with two sliders.   The fries are amazing!! I highly recommend them. Hand cut, cooked perfectly (crispy) and salted. You can order them as an appetizer. Comes with either house made curry or garlic aioli.",

I opted for the wings which were great!   Overall the menu was very eclectic with a wide range of options. I was in and out quickly and left full and happy!",

    "text": "(Lyrics - The Rolling Stones - Paint It Black)  I see a red door and I think it's Kettle Black No searching anymore I want to some Kettle Black I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes I have to try their pork until my belly grows  I see a line of beers and they're at Kettle Black With lagers and my stout both forever to come back I see people try their food and quickly eat away Like a new born Yelper it just happens everyday!  Solid bites with a solid atmosphere; The Kettle Black deliveries in many ways!  The place is built and designed like an English pub.  They look like they had a pretty good whiskey selection, but it was warm out so I shot for a beer; actually a beer flight.  I do wish they had a better local beer selection.    As for the food, I ordered their Pork Belly Sliders.  Pork Belly along with Honey Sriracha Glaze, Cabbage & Carrot Slaw, and Wasabi Aioli.  Needless to say, boom!  The pork belly was cooked to perfection with a solid meaty texture while the cabbage slaw provided some welcoming texture.  The honey Sriracha glaze and wasabi aioli brought the sweetness along with a sting to the nostrils and kick of spice.  Overall, this was a bite worthwhile.  Portion was a tad bit small from what I'm used to at American restaurants, but it was just right for me.  I don't eat a lot in general so all is well in my books.    In the end, The Kettle Black service was on point and quick.  Drink selection especially beer can be better I think.  I'll definitely come back for Happy Hour sometimes and get their Pork Belly Sliders again!",

It's funny because I always talk about how I wish the pub in my hometown served food and was just a little bit bigger. If that actually happened, you would get The Kettle Black. They have awesome service, food and a nice variety of drinks! Basically everything you need.   Me and my friends went here before we had to come back home from out Vacation and I still remember the taste of the fries..Ugh!!! Both the Philly Cheese Fries and Buffalo Chicken Fries were amazing. I love how all the food comes out looking fancy but yet they are still at affordable prices. The Kettle Wings were amazing. The Crab Cakes were amazing. Heck. Everything was amazing. The whole experience was amazing. I definitely will want to come back here if I revisit Arizona!",

    "text": "First, a big thank-you to the feedback from local Yelpers for recommending Kettle Black to me. I came here specifically because they have one of the better whiskey selections downtown, but among our group of 4, we all enjoyed all the drink, food, and especially the atmosphere.   Our drinks were a variety of a beer flight, cocktails, bourbon and scotch. For the bourbon and scotch, the pours are generous and the prices are very reasonable. One ding for mixing up the glasses of bourbon and scotch when delivered to the table.   My 1st Street Burger was ordered medium and came out medium well but was otherwise delicious, another of those \"you must unhinge your jaw to eat it\" burgers. The onion ring, which I removed before eating, was also quite good, with a distinct flavor to the batter, making me regret not having ordered more. Another person at the table said his Guinness Braised Short Ribs were among the best he's ever had. The food came out very quickly too.   So thank you again to local Yelpers and to Kettle Black.",

Giant, soft, right amount of salt and the cheese sauce was absolutely tasty. The ground mustard is True ground mustard, I was impressed.  Second time I was getting in from a delayed flight and needed dinner. I have been eating fish and chips since I was 5, so I had to try theirs. The batter is light and crispy, it doesn't over power the fish or make it too greasy. The Chips were well done also and tartar sauce (I'm very picky about tartar sauce). The coleslaw was the only part I could have done without. It was def mayo based but was pretty bland, I usually like my slaw with a kick or sweetness. Even though it was lacking, I still ate it, I've had much worse slaw. I would say it was average.  With my meal I ordered a Prairie vape tricks sour cherry ale. Omg! I'm not a beer person and this ale is made for a non-beer person. I get ciders a lot, and this ale was basically a cider. Crisp, zingy and sweet. You can taste the sour at the end and it was sooo yummy.",

To park in this area was exceptionally difficult as many of the nearby parking structures were closed.   Decor: This place definitely carries an English style type pub, low ceilings with dark wooden panels. Their bar is constructed in a British way with big tap heads. You sit yourself, either in an open circular booth or on stools along side long wooden slab tables.   Prices/menu: The menu is definitely reasonably priced with most sandwiches and burgers 12-13 dollars, and appetizers 9-10. The former is the bulkiest portion of their menu with a variety of items across different cuisines from American (BBQ burgers), to Asian (Asian pork sliders) and Greek (lamb gyros). They have a solid beer selection.  Service: Service was quick and timely, couldn't ask for anything better to be honest.   Food: I ordered the Reuben with a side of cole slaw, and unfortunately the only good part of the meal was the marble rye bread which may or may not be made in house. The sauce was bland and the corned beef was ok. The coleslaw was pretty bad, sure fire bet that you could get pre-made grocery store slaw with higher quality.   All in all, I could've gone to Arby's to get a meal as good. The decor, vibe and service was good but the food fell very short of the mark.",

Everyone was very friendly and made us feel welcomed. Second, the food was amazing. We ordered hot wings as an appetizer and they were made to perfection. My husband ordered the bacon onion burger and he really enjoyed it. I ordered the beef short ribs and they were one of the best dishes I've ever had. The meat was flavorful and tender. It also came with brussel sprouts and spaghetti squash, both of which made excellent sides. I was so full that I couldn't finish my plate so my husband gladly cleaned it off for me. For dessert we tried their bread pudding. Yes I was full but our waiter really hyped it up and since we probably won't be in Phoenix again we had to try it. It was sooo good! I loved the fact that it doesn't have raisins. We left the restaurant with nothing but positive things to say about it and we highly recommend it for anyone looking for a great dining experience.",

My husband and I were very excited to sit down and begin our meal - I love when downtown Phoenix gets another high quality option for dinner.  We started with the battered chicken tenders appetizer served with mango chutney. They were great! However, the serving dish for the chutney was tiny - should've been for half or even a third the portion of chicken. We rationed it out to make it last, and still ran out halfway through. Next time the waitress came around, we asked for another serving of chutney. She informed us that it would be an extra $1.00 charge. WAT. Seemed a little ridiculous to charge extra for a dip that we barely got in the first place. We ended up using ketchup, which seemed a little second rate after the delicious mango stuff.  Considering that our bill ended up being over $70, it seems like the owners shouldn't have to add ticky tac charges not disclosed on the menu and risk putting off new customers.",

    "text": "Went here with a few friends on the 8th, but I've debated writing this review due to the fact it is a new business. After mulling it over, my experience deserved a write up.   A friend had recommended the place, despite having only been there for a couple drinks and not having ordered off the menu. The restaurant atmosphere was alright. It was quaint, small, and cleanly. It advertises an Irish theme, but really felt like any run of the mill downtown spot. The restaurant was a little busy, but our server got to us immediately, and she was very professional and courteous throughout our whole stay there. Honestly, our service was probably the best part of our experience there.  In starting with drinks, when it came to drafts, they offered mostly domestics, while the craft beers were offered in bottles. The craft/international selection was small, but I could see them growing the list in the future.  I ordered the fish and chips at $13 for dinner. Which is very reasonable pricing for a downtown venue, but had I known what I was receiving, I'd have been better off at Captain D's than this \"gastropub\".   We had waited roughly over an hour for our food to arrive at our table, and when it did, I experienced probably one of the most disappointing meals I've ever had. My plate had a medium portion of fries, a spoonful of coleslaw, one portion of fish the size of a schoolchild's fist, and a side of \"special\" tartar sauce. Everything, I mean everything, was bland. Vinegar couldn't help the fish, salt couldn't help the fries, the coleslaw tasted like they TRIED to remove flavor from it, and the \"special\" tartar sauce tasted like they squeezed it out of a Heinz bottle. Around the table, there were various murmurs from the rest of my group that their food was either disappointing or just OK.   I understand that restaurants have their bad nights, and it seems that a lot of people have had decent experiences here, but I was absolutely taken aback by how disappointing this place was. Also witnessed that night, a waiter dropped a burger onto a ladies purse and she was picking out toppings from it for awhile, and a man was delivered a chicken sandwich, in which they did not put the chicken into the sandwich, because the chef was \"unsure if he wanted it or not.\" It's going to take a lot of convincing to get me back to the Kettle Black again.",

Good selection of beers here and the decor is simple and cozy. Friendly wait staff too. Check this spot out if you're downtown.",

Service was very good, though I would note it was not busy.  Was impressed how the food was delivered by three people who each set the plates down.

The place was filling up quickly for a Saturday early evening 4:30p.m. (great sign). The bartenders were so helpful & quick. We got the pretzel for a snack & it was delish. Loved the cheese sauce & mustard. I really love me a good mustard so this was great to me. The pretzel was really good all by itself. Soft, warm & fluffy on the inside with a slight chew on the outside. Just like a pretzel should be. Definitely not a reheat. I'm so going to have to go back & try the steak salad & fish & chips. They were ordered on either side of me while sitting at the bar. They looked really good too. Maybe this will be a 5 star review after I try more than a delish pretzel.

I was going to wait to write a review until I got to go again and watch some live music...but I don't know when that will happen, and I already know I'll enjoy myself five stars' worth, anyway. So, why wait?  I made it on one of the soft opening nights (along with everyone else and their mothers), and it was definitely not lacking for patrons. Luckily enough, my friend and I were just early enough that we caught one of the bench booths by the door, but I don't think we would have found a seat much farther in (good for them!).  The staff had to have been pretty ragged from the full Friday before, all day Saturday, and anticipating all day Sunday...but our server was friendly as ever and just a cool chick. You know...like when you're exhausted from busting your ass, but you're appreciative of all of the people there...that's how it felt to me.  I ordered a Smithwick's and the Southwest Chicken Wrap (my favorite at TF). The waitress actually thought I had said Blackened Chicken, so that's what I received...but I attributed it to my lack of a booming voice and viewed it as a chance to try something I might not have noticed otherwise, so I kept the Blackened Chicken sandwich and...oh my, was that serendipitous. The chicken breast was juicy and flavorful, the avocado was...avocado (yum), and the ciabatta was buttery and squishy and just pretty much perfect. I found a secondary favorite to switch off with the Southwest Chicken Wrap.  The waitress took great care of us, and every staff member/owner that I happened into was friendly and wonderful, but I expected no less in that arena.  If I get to move closer to the area, this is going to be my go-to spot, hands down, and I will happily spread the word. I love these people.  Oh and the look of the place is just beautiful...I will make it a goal to sit and enjoy every area of the joint at some point, including the adorable window seats looking out on the sidewalk. I don't know if there's a proper \"architectural\" term for those, lol...I'm sure someone on this site will be able to put me in my place in no time. :)",

The mussels were fine, not spectacular, not terrible... Really just unmentionable.   The fries had two drops of truffle oil on them, and I had to have them bring me the oil so that I could do it myself.   The worst part of the meal was the \"bread pudding\" it's a joke. It's a very creative way for the restaurant to use all of their stale brioche rolls from the burgers that don't sell, but it was awful to actually eat. One of the rolls had grill marks on it from it being heated for a burger! It was stale, and really just lazy.   Bread pudding is baked, made with love, and a pretty important historical Irish cuisine. It was insulting to eat it, and they should be embarrassed.   I give it two stars for beer, and for being downtown.",

Then they were out of all IPAs, and acted like we were sort of an inconvenience to be asking for a table or a beer. Overall, it was so unfriendly and awkward that we ended up just leaving.",

It took one of our party 30 minutes to get a salad with no dressing on it and the other person who ordered a salad got hers in 45 minutes.  I went with the mac n cheese thinking that would be quicker since our waiter warned us the chicken kabobs would take longer.  The mac n cheese took 50 minutes.  I imagine that the kabobs would have been an even hour.  I might give the place another shot since the food was decent and maybe it was just an off night.",

The service was amazing. I first ordered the bread pudding and after looking through the menu further I switched my mind and wanted to go with the buffalo chicken fries. I asked our waitress it was too late to change the order and she said she would go check. She came back a minute later and said that mine was next and we caught it just in time. I was happy I was able to switch, the buffalo chicken was on the spicy side but certainly a good choice on a cold day. You get a huge bowl of fries with buffalo chicken chunks and cheese sprinkled on top. Next time I'll add in the bread pudding. Overall, I was impressed with the service, the food quality and portion size. Very good indeed!",

In between the baseball game and the music festival we wanted to find a spot we could chill at until it was time to go hear some music. I had looked for good Yelp reviews in the area, and this place came up.   When we got there, it was super crowded. I almost said let's go somewhere else, but a couple ended up getting up from the bar so we snagged those seats.   The bartender was friendly. We ordered wine here and an order of buffalo chicken fries. We were debating between the Philly Cheesesteak fries or these, and the bartender said we should definitely go with the buffalo chicken fries.   I ordered bleu cheese on the side because my girlfriend hates it, and I'm only a fan of a really tiny portion on my buffalo saucey stuff. The fries were good. We split them, and that was plenty of food to hold us over. We were going to order more food as well, but we had to get going to the festival.   Overall, it was a nice environment. Crowded like I said... So you may be in for a bit if a wait. Sitting at the bar is one good tip I have for this place.",

My wife had the hummus and pita and it was very good as well. Beer prices were just whatever..typical for a downtown bar. We both had a couple stellas then moved on to scotch. Some Glenmorangie 10 year and MaCallan 12. I of course got mine neat and was surprised they charged us an extra $1 to have my wife's on the rocks. Seriously, you charged me an extra $1 to put ice in her drink? Lol other than that we had a good bartender and a good time. I'll go back next time I'm downtown.",

Entered, stood for about 10 minutes after which I has to find staff to ask them to be seated (the sign said wait to be seated). The crazy thing is staff walked past us many times and didn't bother asking us to sit. Once we finally got seated, the server was almost too busy to care for us. We ordered s9me good which was not nice at all. The fish was oily on the outside, dry in the inside. The pretzel board was covered in butter. Sickening. Goes without saying we will not be back. Save your money and eat at taco bell - cheaper and likely more nourishing!",

Being downtown, the service is quick and accommodating because people have to get back to work. I usually sit at the bar because it's so aesthetically pleasing and uniquely designed. The menu has great variety of foods but I've only ordered one item. I've been hooked on the seared sesame ahi tuna salad. It has a bit of a kick to it and I'm addicted.",

I didn't sense the sriracha sauce that comes on it.  It's nice that salad and soup are both side options for the sandwiches and the side salad didn't disappoint.    Typical upscale-ish Irish pub sorta vibe inside.  Good and friendly service.",

So I came over here, expecting slightly better than average late night grub.    oooooweeeeeee!!   The food is great, great, great!!!  A lot of good eats are on the menu so I picked the chicken kebabs and soup of the day (tomato beet soup) then topped it off with a cheesecake.   Gosh!   What a great meal! And, at a late night, too!   Then, I get the bill -- it is really reasonably priced for soup, entree, and dessert.  Everything is totally great!  The service is amazing, too!   My waiter was really attentive to my glass of water -- I kept downing the water like crazy because I'm from the northeast and not used to the dry heat oven-like temps here in Phoenix.  So after the second empty glass, he brings over a much larger glass of water -- that's pretty cool because the place was quite jumping with late night diners and drinkers.  It doesn't stop there.   During the time I was eating, the owner and then the chef stopped by the table to ask about the meal and if there was anything else I wanted.   Now that's darn great customer service.   I know where I'm going the next time I'm in Phoenix, hungry for dinner, and it's past 9p.   I'm coming here!  Great ambience, great service, great food, no hole in my pocket afterwards.  Totally awesome dining experience!",

Stumbled across the gem during the summer when it was 115 outside and have not stop thinking about it since! The ambiance is chill and super friendly. Mikeal is fun and very attentive so service is top notch. The food is excellent we had the chicken kabob and the dipping sauce is so yummy you could dip anything in it. (Sweet chili)  we also shared Citrus chicken salad which was light and refreshing.  Do I recommend The Kettle Black? ... Hands Down!  Ps. Added benefit it feels like a place you'd find in NYC!

The fish and chips was probably the best I have had in phoenix but it wasnt special. The mac and cheese was bland and the scallops were rubbery. The crab cakes were so good with the wasabi cream. The atmosphere was amazing. The drinks were strong and delicious. The staff was fantastic. I think it is definitely a place to drink and hang out, just maybe skip dinner. All in all I would totally recommend it and plan to visit again someday.",

    "text": "Had a good time with a buddy getting a couple beers and some late night grub. Went with the bartender recommended burger. Had good flavor but a little weak on the bun game. Fell apart pretty quickly but went caveman style and knocked it out. Buddy ordered the chicken kabobs. Came out looking good enough for other bar guests to get intrigued. Only feedback would be for them to lower the lights or adjust them so the ambiance gets a better feel. Seemed like most were turned too high up and made it slightly weird feeling inside. Don't underestimate light bulbs.",

    "text": "Decided on this local PUB just around corner from my hotel. I had read good things about this place on Yelp and was expecting more than it delivered... I had the Ruben Sandwich with hand cut fries with a pint of Guinness. This was during Happy Hour on a Wednesday night and the place was roughly at about half capacity. First complaint: with several TV's showing multiple games simultaneously, NO sound from ANY of the games were on... Instead I had to listen to \"Born in the USA\" by Springsteen while LeBron was showing the way of the REAL King on the court... Confusing? The answer is absolutely YES! Second complaint: The hand cut fries was nothing special. Even Jack in the Box has better tasting \"hand cut fries\". Third complaint: A pint of Guinness is $6.00 - DURING HAPPY HOUR... Seriously? Now to the positive: the Ruben Sandwich was actually VERY GOOD! Creamy dressing, perfectly battered and toasted bread with succulent, tender corned beef and sauerkraut that would make a native German asking for more! Too bad the serving of corned beef was not big enough for my liking...",

We each had a cocktail, which I felt was just OK for a craft cocktail. It was a little too syrupy for my taste preference but some may really like them. Overall, we had a good experience! The only reason why I only give it three stars though is that there wasn't anything special that makes me want to go back there. If I'm in the area again it's likely I would stop in but it's not likely that when I'm making plans that this place would come to mind.",

The salad was wilted and had clearly been prepped and sitting in the fridge for at least a day, the green beans tasted like microwaved frozen green beans, and the fries were drowning in oil.  The gentleman that served us was pleasant and did a very good job.",

Imagine paying for your warm beer then being told to leave because you want a cup of water. That was my second experience at Kettle Black on March 28th. Steve was the bartender. He actually refused to bring me water. How would you respond, what would you do? I told him I was going to write a review then he changed his mind and he brought me water in a to go cup. It was the only thing he did right. My first experience at Kettle Black in October I ordered a burger, it came with a twist tie wire in the burger. If you like the chance of death by twist tie wire then this is the place for you. I imagine you can find 10 to 20 other great places to drink within 3 blocks of this place. I suggest the Copper Blues, Hanny's or the Nook.",

As opposed to other pubs this one is clean. Music is good and at a good level. We sat at the bar and appreciate the plugs to charge our phones.  Service - It was great. The bartenders were hustling because they were busy but always took time to check on us. I appreciated the feedback from our bartender when I asked for suggestions on the menu.  Food - Also great. Crab cakes app was very good. You don't think of crab cakes in Phoenix but they pulled off. Good size, taste and the wasabi mayo worked with it. Ordered the fish & chips on our bartenders recommendation and he didn't steer us wrong. The highlight was the batter on the fish. A big portion that comes with fries that are not traditional pub fries but are hand cut and really, really good. The braised short ribs had good flavor and a good size serving. You don't see brussel sprouts too often in a pub and they were great.  Great place, will make a destination for fish & chips, and of course the Guinness. A lot more on the menu to try and I expect it to be good also.",

Our friends also got the wings and they said that they were really good! I can see us going again just before an event!",

The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Great atmosphere. A little noisy, but nothing beyond a normal pub with people. Definitely consider the pecan crusted chicken with mango mustard sauce, so good. One of my colleagues had the reuben and said it was very good. I had the fish and chips one night, fries were a little soggy for my taste, but still tasted good. Overall, great spot.",

It took a long time to be waited on. We finally ordered our food, then waited a really long time to get it. We had chicken kabobs and flat iron steak. The chicken was very dry. The steak was better. It was fairly tender and had a tasty sauce. They came with green beans that were super garlicky (if you love garlic, they are good) and some very bland mashed potatoes. The margaritas were fair as was the apple crumb dessert. Like our entrees though, the dessert took forever. If they had been busy, we would have been more forgiving of the long wait. It's not a place we would come back to.",

Also ordered the steamed muscles, crab cakes, and caprese salad and it was super delish!  My husband ordered the steak with string beans, and mashed potatoes, and he said that was really good too!  My only complaint is they only  1 dessert on the menu.  Not a fan of bread pudding, so we didn't order it.  So happy we stumbled upon this place though.

The home made fries themselves was aweaome but the toppings were greasey.  The wings were on the smaller side but still had a great flavor.  Hummas was my favorite.   Dinner was fish/chips, burger, steak salad, corned beef/cabbage & vodka pasta. Everything was great except the vodka pasta.  Tasted like rague sauce with pasta.  The corned beef/cabbage was devine as the corned beef was think cut and moist. So good!  The steak salad had great flavors and the dressing was the bomb.  I suggest to get it on the side.   Dessert was bread pudding and that is because they had nothing else. It was still really good.  Drinks was your tipical bar though they were sub par on cocktails. I liked that they muttled fresh fruit/veggies but not for all their drinks. There was one drink they made i really liked but that is because i had the alter it a little.",

I ordered the chicken kabobs and my DH ordered the sweet chili chicken wings. Neither disappointed but I have to RAVE about the kabobs. From the first bite I was hooked. Not only was the chicken moist but it was simply divine. Whatever they marinate their chicken in should be bottled and sold on supermarket shelves everywhere! Amazing doesn't cover it. And the roasted corn pico and sweet Chile sauce only added to the magic of the dish. Served on a bed of green beans (YUM!!) the kabobs were huge and tasty. For $13 I would eat these all day, everyday!!  I also have to give kudos to their fresh cut french fries. We ordered the garlic fries and while they weren't very garlicky (we are from WA state where we are used to Safeco field garlic fries) the lack of garlic was doin forgotten simply due to the deliciousness of the fries! Like I said- don't pass this place up if you're in the Phoenix area. It's more than worth doing to!!",

We decided to drink beers but no food because it is cool place to hang out and we love the bartender Steven. After going through the other pubs, I feel tHt kettle pus is a way better than other .  I am updating my review after four times I went after initial review. It is so hard to park and during four times of visits, they told me Heineken was out and my friend beer was out too. They only have less than 6 draft beers and every time we went they are out. We went early and also late so it is not acceptable as a downtown bar their main business is selling beers. No more this place for beer. Sorry four times of out of beers don't give them any excuse.",

I don't know if the people writing the great reviews have never had good cuisine but the food here was bad, really bad. I had Caprese Stuffed Chicken which was overcooked and had an incredibly weird texture, like eating cartilage.  Yuck! It was drenched in sauce. Very disappointing.  The place was swarming with fruit flies which is never a good sign. We had to keep swating the fruit flies away the entire time and we were not near the bar! Cleanliness is an issue. The beer tasted old and flat (fruit flies all over the beer). In my opinion it is best to keep your distance.  I will never go back.",

Flavors were good, but quality of the meat was sub par. The sliders I received had pork belly that was pretty fatty. The salmon my boyfriend ordered was flavorful but nothing spectacular. It's a decent place to try out. The ambiance is great just don't expect to be blown away with the food quality.",

I was offered a choice of a side of either cole slaw or french fries. I had the cole slaw and it was good. The California club sandwich came with lettuce, bacon, avocado, and chicken (besides the bread).  I also had the fish and chips. The chips are actually french fries. I didn't think the french fries were quite as good as some others that I have had before. The fish was pretty greasy, but the coating was light, which I liked. The tartar sauce was good too.  The fish was just one giant piece - it was well cooked but kind of strange to get one big piece instead of a few smaller ones.  Also there were no crispy bits of batter.  There was live entertainment, where a person played the guitar, which made the atmosphere quite loud, so it was difficult to talk with my other dinner companion. I would usually pass on the live entertainment but that's personal preference.  The waiter reminded me of a pirate.",

We just left Dodgers Stadium East, AKA Chase Field looking for some places to hit up. There are not many places around like Tempe but some cool spots.   There are about 10 different beers on the rotation. I went with a local microbrew. I had to order the pork belly sliders. Oh yeah, delicious! I couldn't say no to the mac and cheese with pork belly either. My friends and I just shared it.   Cool place to hang on a weekday. Walking distance to the courtyard Marriott and residence inn.

What a nice surprise is this place.  Our waiter was greeting us almost before we sat down, and the service he provided throughout our drinks, meals and dessert was impeccable.  The manager even stopped to check on us more than once, and even took a drink refill order for us.  Now, as to the food,  we had three very different entrees, and all were excellent, fresh and well-presented.  By 6:00 PM, the place was packed, the entire bar and all the tables occupied.  This made absolutely no difference in the service.  The wait staff and bar staff bust their asses to get food and drinks out.  This place is a gem. Well done!",

    "text": "I found this place on Yelp during a quick trip to Phoenix.  It's a small restaurant with a nice vibe.  We were immediately greeted, and we were served water while we perused the menu.  The service was fast and friendly throughout our meal.  I ordered the reuben, and my husband ordered the wasabi caesar salad.  I love reubens and order them regularly at restaurants.  This reuben was pretty sad.  The meat was thinly sliced and pretty bland.  There was the tiniest amount of 1000 Island, and the tiniest amount of sauerkraut.  Not bad, just nothing memorable.  My husband's salad was also disappointing.  Billed as a wasabi caesar salad, it was made with greens instead of romaine, and it had NO wasabi taste at all.  It was so odd, he actually asked the server if he got the right item.  She was really sweet and explained that it was a \"different style\" caesar.  She asked if he wanted something different, but he didn't.  Odd experience.  Not terrible, just not enticing us to go back.",

Some outdoor seating and a surprisingly deep dining area with booths and tables.  Understated decor. Good selection at the bar. Cocktail menu was inspiring and the bartender delivered on quality & presentation!  Our server Melissa was professional, friendly and helpful as I tried to only pick One entree even though \"everything\" sounded super tasty. The staff all appeared happy to be there and seemed to help each other which created a pleasant vibe around us.  Wings were tender and tasted freshly prepared. Scallops (I know, I know...seafood in Phx?) but Yes it was good and I would get it again but probably with the lemony sauce on the side. So glad we found a new Date Nite location before the Ballet.",

We thought ordering an appetizer meant we'd get that first, but it came after we were almost done with our meals. Everything we ordered was nicely done. The Southwest Wrap was very large & tasty, the Lamb Gyro was good but could have used slightly more sauce or even tomato...something to moisten it up a bit more as it was slightly dry. The crab cakes were nice, but a little pricey for the 2 small bites. Everything came with a nice choice of sides, however, straight balsamic vinegar was not an option for the salad. It was either red vinegar & oil or a sweetish/tangy mixed balsamic vinaigrette but was told we couldn't get just straight balsamic vinegar with the salad. I'm not sure why that was an odd request. It is a very small place but very nicely done, great atmosphere & theme, very relaxing...that was definitely a plus. Since there is so little to choose from in the area on certain days/times, we were thankful to find this little place.",

There is a great cocktail and beer list along with a large variety of whiskeys (given this is an English style pub). The menu also reflects the theme with many burgers/sandwich/wrap options and with the traditional fish and chips dish and bangers and mash. We got the buffalo chicken fries and lamb gyro with the soup of the day (chowder) and were quite pleased!! I'm usually not a big fan of buffalo chicken but this dish was not too overwhelming with the blue cheese and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The lamb was seasoned very well in a perfectly toasted gyro! Thanks for a great end to our day!",

First off, this is a bar (perhaps even a dive bar), not a restaurant. On a Thursday night, it was loud & rowdy, and the majority of people there were just drinking and not eating. When I see \"gastropub\" listed on the category I expect craft beer, good cocktails and good food. Sadly, it seems there are none of these things here.   Beer - average selection Cocktails - ALL very sweet (but strong) Food - Meh.  I ordered the crab cakes and they were deep fried, which I think is a sign of a bad restaurant. My friend got the flat iron steak, which looked most unappealing on the plate but didn't taste horrible. Both dishes were very blah but what did we expect in a sticky counter type bar?",

I don't think it would have been possible for me to eat all of them by myself.   The atmosphere was clean enjoyable. Football was on the TV's and the beer selection was perfect.   I don't think I could have enjoyed a better night out and wish I had time to go back again during my stay downtown.",

Crab cake was light, fresh and good portioned.  My husband had the fish & chips and the fish was one huge fillet, lightly battered, fresh and flakey. But the house made tarter sauce was the belle of this ball. It was tangy but sweet, and hit all the right notes with the fresh fried fish.  I had the chicken caprese sandwich and side house salad. Portions were good and while the salad was nothing to write home about, the seasoned chicken, fresh mozzarella, and ripe tomato on the sandwich made up for it. Yum yum yum!  Our server received a nice big tip for constant (but not overly) attentive service and regularly refilled mimosas.  When visiting downtown Phoenix make this a stop on your agenda.",

My mom  ordered the soup of the day which was a cream chicken with bread. My sister had fish and chips, and I had curry fries and the black bean burger. Everything was great. This is a pub atmosphere with pub food made better than traditional pub fare by a creative chef. The music was loud and from the late 1960's and 70's. Sports played on flat screen televisions. Behind the bar, the liquor cabinets had picture frames around them. We arrived about 4:30 pm and the place earnestly came to life within an hour; filled by tens of customers having a good time. It's a place you can take a first date, or your buddies from the office. The Jolly Diners rated the Kettle Black a 4 out of 5.",

I ordered a black bean burger and fries with their curry dipping sauce. I asked the bartender if their black bean burger was any good and he assured me it was, and he was right on! My meal was excellent- hit the spot. My wife had their 1st street burger and she enjoyed it as well. The house made hummus appetizer was also pretty tasty, with a bit of a different texture and taste than I am used to. The atmosphere was cool, with some Deltron 3030 playing on a lower volume in the background for optimal digestion and conversation. Upon leaving, the super cool bartender shook both of our hands and thanked us. If I was from this area I'd totally make this place one of my spots.",

Not for fun mind you - but simply because our service was terrible and we couldn't find anyone to give us our check so we could leave. This is definitely a place to sit at the bar and get service - otherwise best of luck on your server noticing you. We ordered 2 margaritas (not bad but tasted like sweet & sour mix was used), fish & chips, and the flank steak. The food was pretty good, fries were perfect. The sauce that came w/ the steak was a bit sugary but still a delicious dish. The atmosphere was stylish, dark, divey, and worked well together. The service was very slow. We requested our check three times and didn't get anything until late (very tempted to just walk out). We attempted to order more drinks but the server would disappear and no one else helped us. Later (~20mins) the server returned and told us she had a big table and they had difficult picky orders (which why servers complain about other customers TO customers I don't understand). Food was good, drinks were okay, service was bad.",

Four courses and four beers for $40! It was worth every penny. Unfortunately, I didn't have anything that wasn't off that menu, but those seated next to had equally looking delicious food. They raved about it.   The customer service was amazing!!! They ran like a well oiled machine. Our waitress, I wish I remembered her name (tall thin long haired blonde) was very friendly and attentive. The manager was constantly making the rounds and was really putting in the effort to make sure his customers were pleased. You can tell this location prides itself in not only their food, but their customer service.  If this location has anymore special events like this, I would love to attend.",

    "text": "I want to start out by saying that when I heard about this #pub opening I was so excited to try it. When I finally stumbled in this weekend I was thrown off immediately when I saw the menu. While the new decor reminds you of a minimalist twenty first century mod pub... there is absolutely no cohesive pub theme on the menu.   I noticed steak, fish and chips and Guinness however none of these were highlighted, they have them near the bottom. This American #pub offers a variety of starters, salads, burgers and entrees however, vegetarians beware...  you will probably only be able to choose between fries or a pretzel.   I chose the blackened chicken sandwich which had great flavor between the chicken and avacado. It was delicious however it cost around $13 for the sandwich and a small portion of fries. Wasn't worth going back just for the food in my opinion....   In addition to southwestern American menu choices mixed with English pub faves like fish and chips... The service was spotty. I had to remind the server what I ate in a party of four and then correct her when she confused the items on our checks. After pointing out the error the server gave an excuse as to it being a whole new systen.... unless the computer is randomly separating checks that is a human error which would have been okay with a simple acknowledgment rather than blaming the establishment.   There were no drink specials nor drink menu in this #pub.  Since this is a soft opening I suggest putting more emphasis on the #pub atmosphere. They have the kitchen part down. In addition, offer a vegetarian entree for the animal lovers out there! They are people too..   Thanks Kettle Black. I hope the smell of new wood wears off soon. I felt like I was in the lumber section of home depot.",

I ordered a Strongbow cider, which arrived crisp and cold in a matter of minutes. For my entree, I ordered the Corned Beef & Cabbage with mashed potatoes and an onion demi sauce.  Now, it needs to be said that this dish in general is my favorite, but only the way my mom makes it. Time and time again, I have ordered it in the hopes of getting remotely close to the deliciousness of my mom's corned beef and cabbage.   They have all failed...until now. It was AMAZING. The corned beef was tender and didn't have too much fat on it, the mashed potatoes were creamy and fluffy, and the cabbage was cooked to perfection; buttery and slightly meaty without overpowering the cabbage flavor. It was all wonderful. I wanted to keep shoveling it into my mouth but sadly, there is only so much room in my stomach (the foodie's Achilles heel) and I had to get some boxes (yay leftovers!).  The servers were friendly and accommodating, the ambiance was relaxed and comfortable, and the food was delicious. The Kettle Black, do NOT change this dish, I beg of you. It is the best I've had and I'll be damned if you take it away from me!",

As far as the bar goes its serious. A great selection of Whiskey and Scotches as well as anything else you could ask for.  First time we had the Fish and Chips and Bangers and Mash both as you would hope from an Irish pub excellent and a can't miss. This we time split the Guinness short ribs. The short ribs were perfect  melt in your mouth and not overpowered by the Guinness that often occurs in this dish .The Spaghetti Squash that came with the short ribs are out of this world creamy and delicious. We split the main course so we would have room for Nana's bread pudding.This is is bread pudding on a whole new level. I think we would have eaten the plate if we could, and my wife does not normally like bread pudding. This is not a large place but has tables and bar-tops  to handle a good size group. So if your in downtown Phoenix and want a friendly place that serves  outstanding food this is it.",

At the bar, they had several outlets (which for a solo traveler, I really appreciated- not something I would traditionally take advantage of if I was with someone else). The bartender was friendly and prompt.  I ordered the grilled chicken club and fries.  I must have had \"midwest\" girl written all over, as he asked me if wanted a side of ranch for my fries.  I definitely didn't decline! The food came out pretty quickly and it was a generous portion.  Everything about the sandwich was fantastic- crisp bread, juicy chicken, crisp bacon, all topped with avocado & a nice aioli. The fries were a little on the cooler (than I would have wished side), but still good- especially after craving fries for nearly 3 weeks without having them!  I would definitely recommend if you are in town & need a quick lunch, or a casual spot to hang out.",

What a gem in downtown Phoenix! :)   This is not your typical bar food at all. It's got style, class, pizzaz! Our server was fantastic and super friendly without being overly involved with our conversations. He kept drinks full, asked us great questions, and gave great recommendations.  We started off simple with the Bavarian Pretzel and they had a charcuterie sampler that was outstanding. I think it was a special because it's not on the regular menu. I had the Southwest Chicken Wrap and it was outstanding. The sauce had a lovely jalapeno kick to it and the chicken was perfectly done. My husband had the peppercorn flat iron steak. It was excellent. The potatoes on the side were AH-MAZ-ING. One friend had the Bacon Onion Burger which was out of this world and the other had the Reuben which was the best we've had in quite some time.   Prices were quite reasonable, service was excellent and the food was really worth the trip.   I'm really looking forward to going back the next time I'm downtown! I hope you'll give it a try!",

The food was good, and I was a huge fan of their salads. So much so that I went back the next day for lunch and got the same citrus chicken salad. The spicy honey wings were surprisingly tasty more so than I thought they would be and were cooked nicely. Service was friendly and prompt with taking orders, bringing the food out, and cashing us out.",

Unassuming from the exterior but so warm friendly and inviting once through the doors. Ordered the Bavarian pretzel DELICIOUS  follow by the Bacon onion burger which was equally amazing! Plenty of great beers on tap and of course football all around. The best part of our visit was Gill the bartender. Amazing service super friendly ridiculously funny and knowledgeable of the beers on tap. Cocktails are available too but we were in a brew mood this day. Definitely make a stop if you are in the area.",

I asked for a box and they had to go ask the restaurant next door for a box because they'd run out. Awkward! The only reason they're not a 5 star is because we sat at the bar next to where the waitresses ask for drinks. There was an angry blonde waitress every time we turned around complaining about how busy she was and how mad she was. That was so unprofessional.",

Was told that the garlic butter ones are even better. The burger and turkey burger were quite decent, hitting the spot. But, the corned beef stew is what will have us coming back whenever we're in Phoenix again. Definitely recommend visiting/eating here.",
