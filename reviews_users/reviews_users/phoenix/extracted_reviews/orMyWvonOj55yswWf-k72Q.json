The food was overpriced and wasn't the greatest. I had Avocado toast which was decent, but $9 for one piece of toast??? I think i will go somewhere else. It is too bad because i really liked the restaurant's deco and concept.",

    "text": "We were touring the area & in the mood for brunch & the hotel recommended Farm & Craft. The restaurant is a nice size & has a brightly lit space, inclusive of outdoor seating. I ordered the 'Breaky Burrito' & house-made kombucha. The burrito was served cut on the diagonal & plated in a semi stack, with the corn relish served on the side in a 2oz steel ramekin. The serving size of the burrito was generous & ample enough that I was able to share a few bites with my dining partner. The house-made flax wrap was delicious, had a nice texture & was slightly charred, enhancing the flavor. The ingredients were fresh & well balanced, although the \"nitrate-free bacon\" was a tad overdone & chewy. Overall, it was one of the freshest & tastiest breakfast burritos I've eaten. The kombucha was good & while I didn't have one, they've created a bevy of kombucha cocktails.   The focus of F&C is on healthy & sustainable food, with a menu they boast as a \"seasonal \"Wellness-Menu\".  I enjoyed the atmosphere, the varied food choices & my meal. If I'm ever in Scottsdale again, I hope the choices & foodstuffs will be as refreshing & tasty as they were this visit.",

It's extremely cute and the perfect shades of colors with designs to compliment. I came here for lunch on vacation and the girl who greeted me was very welcoming and energetic. Polite as can be and offered her favorite choices. She recommends the Chicken Bowl with a Hydrator drink. It was delicious. The quinoa paired with avocado blended perfectly together, the chicken wasn't dry and you could taste the grill work done on it, and the edamame salad was couple with cheese underneath. Mouth watering to look at and to taste. The drink, I have no idea what was in there, but holy. It got me a little tipsy. It was fruity and tasty, something perfect on a hot day in Arizona. I included some pictures of the interior and food, it's a must go if you're in the area.",

Totally wish they had an establishment like this in San Diego. If you're into kombucha then they have a huge variety of kombucha and alcoholic beverages. How cool is that? The food is good but I wasn't blown away. I ordered the avocado toast which came with a poached egg on top and with a side of sweet potatoes. I also ordered a side of bacon and a chocolate protein smoothie drink. There was a long wait for the food but it was understandable that there was a lot of huge parties there as well. I would return again if I am in town to try out the other items.",

Okay, so if you're going to Farm & Craft expect healthy breakfast and lunch items on the menu along with smoothies (and cocktails, of course!).   To start off, I ordered the 'Forbidden Fruit', which is a vodka drink served inside a grapefruit. Apparently, it is their signature drink, however, I wasn't really impressed. I think that drink was gone in like 3 or 4 sips.   For my meal, I ordered the sweet potato hash with chicken sausage. O-M-G! It was so good, the meal was filling yet light. I ordered a mimosa to go along with my meal.... because... hey it is brunch after all!   If you're going for brunch, just a WARNING, there might be a bit of a wait. They'll take down your name & number and contact you once a table becomes available.   Overall, great service and they are extremely attentive. I noticed they had Kombucha cocktails, which I didn't get to try, however I am planning to on my next trip. This s a GO TO if you're visiting Scottsdale.",

We arrived at 0945 Sunday morning, and were promptly seated by the dude up front (possible manager) who was in a deep conversation with one of the female employees.  We were seated quickly and given menus.  Fast forward 21 MINUTES LATER.  2 tables were seated, and drinks were brought out to them and their ordered taken.  Our table left completely untouched by the staff.  the ONLY interaction we had with staff was coming and going.  Our table was outside next to the window so easily could have been seen from inside the establishment.  It was in the middle of the patio and we weren't in the corner or anything.  Our menus sat right fricken in front of us.  Not even a water was offered in 21 minutes, but staff who seated and served people literally, right next to us. First off I shouldn't have to wait half an hour to be offered a water! That should be offered once we sit. Secondly I shouldn't have to wait half an hour to even be spoken to by staff.  When we left, manager dude or whoever he was was leaning over the counter talking to another female staff member, I told him we had waited 21 minutes and would like to leave.  His response was \"oh, ok I'm really sorry.\"  Here's a recap.  21 minutes  Unspoken to No water or drinks offered Seated well in plain site.  Several other customers: seated, Ordered AND SERVED. 2 interactions, coming and going.   Here's the really Sh*y part, is my girlfriend is on a diet and this is one of the few places she can go right now and be able to order off of MOST of the menu without special provision. She was excited to come here for the 1st time and we both left disappointed and frankly disrespected",

We will never recommend, we as newly engaged and treated like complete SHIT.  Update as of 10/11/17: A manager, Kevin Berk, reached out to me immediately and had been in continuous communication, apologizing for our experience and assured me he will handle this situation.  Having said that, if Kevin is reflective of Farm & Craft, I would not hesitate to give this establishment another shot next time I am visiting Scottsdale. Unlike the bartender, Kevin has been extremely professional and his effort to make things right is exemplary. Thank you to Kevin for showing fantastic customer service.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I tried this today. We were coming from the gym and anxious to eat some delicious food. Initially upon walking in, the staff seemed in a frenzy. The hostess was nowhere to be found. I approached the \"to-go\" attendant and she notified me the hostess would be back shortly quoting a 10 minute wait. So we sat at a lone chair and the hostess finally came around about 5 minutes later. She said she'd seat us shortly. We thought nothing of it as the place was packed. About 5 minutes later, the same hostess approached us and said sorry, she forgot about us and that it would be another 5 minutes. She just laughed it off and flippantly shrugged her shoulders. Really? We were the only ones waiting at this point. Okay, NOT the best first impressions so far.  We were finally seated. Decor and ambiance is great. Really appreciate the farm, modern feel they have going on. We had a nice waiter who was friendly and attentive. We ordered the chicken salad &pita, as well as the kale salad with steak. Bloody mary (habanero) was surprisingly bland. Chicken salad was good, but not very plentiful. The salad with steak was great.   I understand this is still in its infancy. We are hoping to come back to better initial impressions/front of house service, as well as more flavorful/plentiful servings of food. We will give it another shot as we live up the road! Still hungry.... :/",

The restaurant was also packed every time I walked by, so I HAD to try it.  I originally made a reservation and was sat down right away. However it took the server awhile to take our drink order. And even longer to bring us our waters, and Bloody Mary's. However the food was okay. I ordered the protein toast which wasn't filling at all. My friend I was with also ordered a coffee which the server forgot.  For food I ordered the Protein Toast which was good, but nothing amazing. The Jalapeno Bloody Mary was def the best thing about this place. When they brought our food we asked for silverware, which I ended up getting myself since we had already waited awhile for someone to bring it over.",

And also so cute! You could basically serve me a peanut and I'd be happy after those cocktails but this place actually has great food! Sure it's all organic-y and pricey but you get what you pay for.

My friend had a steak sandwich and she ate every piece of it so I am sure she enjoyed her dish as much as I enjoyed mine. The only thing I would not recommend is the Mac & cheese.

From the time we sat down, our server seemed 'annoyed' that we were there.  The plates weren't cleaned off, she came back infrequently to check on us and we had to keep flagging her down.  Had to ask for plates, more water and clean utensils several times, even getting up myself to get them once the appetizers were served.  We ordered a variety of appetizers, salads, flat breads and entrees.  Salads were horrible, the flat breads were decent and the salmon was marginal.  We will definitely NOT be back.

    "text": "This is my first yelp review. I felt the need to share! Since we moved we had been going to Farm and Craft just about every week and we absolutely loved it. The cocktails are amazing! I got the salmon poke bowl or mushroom flatbread religiously and was never disappointed! My boyfriend got the steak religiously and also loved it! We always sat at the bar and the bartenders were phenomenal. They are so attentive and kind!  Though? There is one server now that has led us to two AWFUL dinners. We stopped our weekly routine after the first time when my boyfriends steak was over cooked and the server insisted he was \"wrong\". He was nothing but rude and made sure to make my boyfriend feel as dumb as possible. We held off on going back for about a month and then went back in last night with some friends only to get the same waiter and same shitty service.   This waiter is so beyond rude and snobby! Aside from his attitude problem, our water glasses were empty pretty much the whole night. I hated my meal, the cauliflower steak. It was so dry and only came with a tbsp of sauce. The waiter cleared my almost full plate, not even asking how it was. To top the night off, I asked for an espresso martini which he said he could ask the bartender to make. He came back and dropped off a milky looking drink on the rocks topped with cinnamon and proceeded to walk away. Before he could leave I asked if this was the espresso martini and he rudely said yes we are out of martini glasses. He proceeded to make me feel like a moron in front of my friends. This was no where close to an espresso martini so I sent it back. When he dropped off the check he made sure to make me feel stupid one last time saying my drink I didn't like was taken off the check.   Like I said, first yelp review. I don't complain, but twice was enough. We will never be dining anywhere but the bar if we even end up going back due to this awful service.",

Today I had the pleasure of meeting Jody, who is an exceptional employee. She served me a delicious breakfast sandwich without cheese like I had asked, and was quick to fill my water. She had an extensive knowledege of the menu and as a regular customer, it made me feel like I was well taken care of. I was freshening up in the restroom which was very clean btw, and it took 15 min for my blueberry green tea (highly recommend btw). It was my fault as my 5 min in the bathroom and a work related call and she comped the iced tea as she knew I had waited. I had requested she not do so; however, it's quality service like that which will ensure this is my brunch spot every weekend. Farm & Craft, you guys are lucky to have a woman like Jody behind the bar, her smile lights up the room. Could not be more pleased with my service! Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone whether your a snow bird here for the winter or you want a refreshing, cold pressed organic cocktail. Not too many places have as many organic, gluten free and fresh options this early. Please keep up the good work Jody!!!!",

    "text": "Went here on vacation. Love the diverse menu with very well-sourced proteins and produce. The decor is very cute and it's in a central spot near our fave Mexi spot Diego Pops.  Did the Yelp check in for Avocado hummus. It was ok. The flatbread was super yum though.  I ordered the raw pad Thai and it was spicier than expected and still lacked favor. I think zucchini noodles are always a bust in raw dishes Bc they can get soggy if pre made which I'm guessing is the case here. My recommendation would be to shift this to a kelp or shirataki noodle base and use an almond butter sauce with mint garnish. You'll get more flavor and still accommodate gf vegans or paleo peeps.  I don't remember what my husband ordered. Our friends ordered flat breads and seemed happy.  Dessert: the brownie is OK. I appreciate the effort in making it a paleo but the coco maple whip was off. If the brownie were warmed, served with cacao ganache or drizzle plus that awesome coconut ice cream it would be out of this world. (My best friend is a vegan chef and I used to be a vegan pastry chef...... sorry)  That said, the vegan matcha cheesecake is AMAZE. I didn't order it Bc it was described as citrusy and non dairy so I expected an overly coconut based matcha dessert but it tasted like straight up matcha cheesecake and the textured crust was sooo yum. Def order this!",

We got the sweet potato and artichoke one with balsamic drizzle on it...it went beyond all my expectations. Wine is good too. Be aware happy hour ends at 6 pm though.

I was a bit hesitant about the cranberries in it before ordering but they really bring this dish together! Mushroom flatbread is always beautifully prepared with fresh ingredients. I enjoy the spicy broccolini. Happy hour has great food & drink deals. Cocktails are delicious here. My favorite is a hard tie between the kombucha habanero and spicy watermelon. I love a spicy drink!! The watermelon is perfect for a hot summer day and makes for a refreshing snack + drink - did I mention the drink is served inside half of a personal watermelon? A must visit spot if you're a health nut like myself!",

We were informed that it wasn't, and given menus. Our server was quite fond of asking questions then walking away before we could reply. Same for the guy who dropped our food. I had to poach utensils from a nearby table because he split.  Cocktails and flatbread were solid.   It was painful to leave a 20% tip for being treated like a nuisance, but I have basic respect and the struggle is real. Perhaps this team had an off night and decided to take it out on our table? The food was good, so I will probably order from postmates, at least my driver tells me thank you and to have a nice night.",

The last time we got up and walked out after being seated by the hostess but no one coming to the table for at least 15 minutes.  They weren't that busy.  And people who came in after us were being helped.  I'm not saying that was intentional, I just think the system isn't dialed in.  Like why do you have three hostesses, yet not enough waitstaff to get to the tables timely?  Anyway...Maybe this saves someone some frustration.

Inside the restaurant is cute (actually the decor looks very similar to Chop Shop), the menu was small and pretty boring. I went with the breakfast burrito and my husband got the American breakfast. The burrito came out sitting in a pool of liquid on the plate and more kept dripping out while eating it. It was VERY bland. The turkey inside was flavorless and they either forgot the bacon or put so little of it in that you couldn't taste it. I had to use sriracha sauce on every bite just to finish it. The menu states it comes with corn salsa, they give you a tiny side which is maybe enough for two bites. The American breakfast was a bit better, the chicken sausage was good but that's about it. The iced coffee had a very overpowering roasted flavor (not in a good way). When it comes down to it, Farm & Craft just seems like a sad copycat of Chop Shop. I would skip this joint and head NEXT DOOR to Chop Shop for higher quality, tastier food.",

The hostess ignored us, and we waited 8 minutes to be greeted by our server when we were sat. I ordered a beer, it took 10 minutes to get. We waited another 5 minutes to order, and the appetizer took 25 minutes to get, and the entrees came out a minute later. To be fair, the restaurant was very busy. But the service was terrible. We will not be back, which is a shame, because this used to be one of our favorite spots. I'm not sure what's going on with this place, it's gotten worse and worse. Do yourself a favor, and don't go here, unless you sit at the bar, and only come during the day. The dinner service is a train wreck.",

The restaurant is very loud and I could barely hear my husband at our two top.   It started with the service, which was painful. Our server took 15 minutes to appear for drink orders and never came back to get our food order. I had to go back to the hostess and ask her to find someone to take our order. I got the wellness cocktail and it tasted more like cold medicine. The food was not good. It was healthy, which is what I wanted, but it just tasted plain and unseasoned. We shared two items for appetizers. The mushroom flat bread was awful, the wheat crust tasted like bad pita bread that wasn't toasted. There were about 5 mushrooms on the entire pizza. And we added chicken sausage which tasted more like hot dog. The kale caesar salad was dry and hardly had any dressing. In the end I told our server what I thought and he merely smiled and handed me the bill. We had planned on ordering entrees but decided to forget it and went to Geisha for two sushi rolls.",

Someone came to our table to apologize when our food arrived. This place has so much potential but lack of service was not acceptable.",

I was mortified. The waitress seems unapologetic and took the bowl back to have it replaced. Who's to say I actually got it remade? Needless to say, I didn't want to eat after that. I'm not looking for a handout, but no even my Diet Coke was comped as an \"I'm sorry.\"  As a general rule of good customer service and as a business owner myself, I would've been apologizing profusely and would have seemed it any way to make it right with the customer. My family stated the their food was just ok...not bad but nothing to write home about. I'm throughly disappointed in he service. I'll never be coming back.",

We sat at a table and it took about ten minutes to be greeted, ordered drinks and those took about 30-45 minutes minutes to come from the bar. The water took about half that time. We ordered food and that came at a reasonable time. We tried to get in another drink order, but after being there for a total of just under two hours we were ready to get out of there. It took a while to see our server to ask for the check, but was quick once we were ready to pay.   Food was good.The prices were fair for everything including drinks and portion sizes were filling.  Everything seemed to be overly health themed and still came out cooked with plenty of butter and carbs as at most restaurants. The vibe makes everyone here think they are making healthy options.   Overall would not recommend to anyone, and will not be returning.",

    "text": "I went here with a big group for lunch a couple days after they first opened. I get we were a big party and they're new, but I never got my order. I ordered a salad, while others in my group had more complicated things that came out quicker. A couple others didn't get their orders either, and when we went to check on it, they said they were going as fast as they can. After 10 more minutes, we went to check again and they asked us what we ordered. Clearly they weren't even making anything, and they wouldn't admit to forgetting about us. The manager asked for our receipts and said he would comp our meals. He didn't.   A server said my order was in the window waiting, but we asked for our food to go and it still took another 10 minutes to bag my salad and bring it to me. Then after a few more minutes my friends finally got their food and we left. Two hours after going to lunch I'm back at my computer having to eat while I work because my lunch break is long over.   Oh, and the salad was awful. I got the strawberry and goat cheese salad, and I didn't realize that meant literally one strawberry. Seriously, there were four strawberry slices cut up laying right next to each other and no other slices anywhere in the salad. The cheese was in a gooey layer at the bottom of the salad, and there were maybe four or five walnuts. It had an odd peppery taste to it I couldn't place. All the ingredients they list on the menu led me to believe it would be sweet. I couldn't finish it.  So, I ended up paying $9 for a salad I didn't eat after waiting over an hour and a half. No one was particularly apologetic over losing our orders, and while the manager was nice, he ended up not comping our meals like he said.",

As a vegetarian, it can sometimes be challenging to find a restaurant that offers many options and quality ingredients. This was not the case here. Lots of choices and great flavors. The avocado hummus was yummy!  Now for the negative - the service! While our server was nice, he pretty much ignored us the entire night. First of all, the wrong drinks were brought to our table THREE times! Then once we got our drinks, our server didn't come back to take our order for an hour! The couple at the table next to us finished their meal, paid their bill, another couple sat down, ordered AND started their dinner before our order was even taken.  We were never asked if we wanted another drink (even though our glasses were empty for over an hour).  We also had a Yelp certificate for a free Avocado hummus which wasn't applied to our bill. But we were so frustrated by that point, we couldn't wait to leave!  What was suppose to be a fun night catching up with old friends, turned into a three hour conversation about wondering if we were ever going to eat.  Overall, the bad service outweighed the good food. Super disappointing.",

    "text": "This place is good for drinks... Meh for food.  They do have gluten free options. Their veggies are on point but their protein is extremely skimpy, whether you order the salmon or the steak, so it is not a good option for anyone looking to protein up post-workout.  It's a little on the pricey side as well. (See my $15 steak bowl with brussel sprouts and cauliflower mash.) The service at this Old Town location is bad, bad, bad, especially the hostess. I strongly recommend that they repeat back the phone number when they put you on the wait list. Instead they kept our party who included a 78-year-old lady waiting in the hot sun for an extra 20 minutes, even though we checked on our table a few times and we were waiting on the bench right in front of the restaurant.  They also forgot our appetizer.  What a way to ruin a celebration lunch.",

    "text": "Checked out Farm & Craft tonight and was a bit disappointed. It was my first time here and mainly because of restaurant week.  The reservation was for 4 people at 6pm. When we arrived our friends were already there so we seated ourselves with them.   Interior has a super cool vibe. It's very laid back and relaxing. Reminded me of original chop house just a bit. We ordered drinks and looked over the menu. We got the 3 course deal as part of restaurant week and the grass fed burger. Upon checking in I also received a free avocado dip.   The grass fed burger was not bad, but nothing really spectacular about it. The bbq chicken flatbread was decent but the bread was too hard. Perhaps a little too done.   In regards to the food it was honestly just ok. I would have given Farm & Craft 4 stars but the  service is what dropped it another star. We waited a long time with empty glasses. When the water was refilled it was warm. The wait to get my beer was quite long as well. When I did receive my beer it was the wrong one. Finally it was time for the check. When the check arrived it was wrong. I had an extra beer on there and we were charged for a drink that should have been a part of the menu for restaurant week. We pointed it out and it was corrected.   In summary the food is not bad but the service was.",

My original experience at Farm and Craft left me disappointed and much to be desired; I expressed my frustration and immediately was contacted by Kevin who invited me back to show what F&C truly has to offer.   So yesterday I (skeptically) decided to give it another try and called in an order to go. I got the hummus appetizer, turkey wrap, and breakfast with sunny side up eggs, chicken sausage, and sweet potato hash. Laura took my order and was quick, competent, and delightful on the phone. I arrived about 10 minutes later and was warmly greeted with my order hot, smelling amazing, and ready to go. It was all packaged separately and each dish nicely displayed in containers.   Once home it was time to dig in and see if the food is actually any good. Well, the breakfast was spectacular, and the eggs were cooked to perfection, the turkey wrap was filled with fresh turkey, avocado, and healthy greens, and the hummus appetizer had lots of accoutrements accompanied by a creamy delicious hummus . The ingredients are clearly of good quality, and you can feel good about what you are putting in your body.   The atmosphere and seating at Farm and Craft is very fun and inviting. It's open and warm; a place that you can meet a friend for lunch or just chill by yourself and get some work done. The food is pricey, but they have good happy hour deals and the flatbreads on the menu look enticing!   I am so glad I had the opportunity to give this place another try and become a fan of not only the restaurant itself, but the management and customer service. Bravo Farm and Craft, Bravo",

It's my go-to when I don't want to make my own healthy food at home, but need some good, clean food served to me. Not only the food, but the drinks here are amazing as well.   Food:  *Roasted Artichoke and Spinach Dip* with cranberry, served with gluten-free quinoa & omega flax chips & carrots- this appetizer is super delicious. Cheese is baked on top of the dip and makes your usual artichoke and spinach dip tastier. You get a healthy spin on chips for dipping with the flax chips and carrots.  *Avocado Hummus* BONUS!!---check into Farm & Craft on Yelp and get this $11 appetizer for FREE!! this hummus was made by mixing avocado, citrus vinaigrette, togarashi spice, and served with a flax pita & assorted fresh vegetables. I remember having cauliflower and carrots for the vegetables.  *Protein Toast* avocado toast with an egg  *Strawberry Apple Acai Bowl* smoothie bowl made using strawberries, acai, almond milk, topped with fruit, granola, and flax seeds or whatever seeds they have in the restaurant. I once got chia seeds, and another time had flax seeds.  Drinks:   *Alcoholic Kombucha* I ordered a kombucha with tequila in it and it was the perfect add-on to my Sunday brunch. You get the healthiness & hydration from the kombucha, but a nice buzz to keep you happy during brunch from the tequila ;)  *Strawberry Juice* strawberry, basil, honeydew melon, grapefruit & lime This juice is my favorite from Farm & Craft. So refreshing and tasty! The perfect drink to quench your thirst in this Arizona heat and not too sweet.",

We started with a Four Peaks IPA and the Cold Brew Nitro Coffee on draft- both amazing. Next up was the creamy avocado hummus serviced with warm pita and veggies (complimentary with a Yelp check-in!). For our main dishes, we tried the egg white scramble and the american breakfast. I loved that they were served with sweet potato hash browns!  The patio served as the perfect spot to people watch and soak in the hubbub of Old Town. Can't wait to come back on our next visit to AZ.",

But it will give you an opportunity to fuel your body with healthy, fresh food in a fun, hip environment.  F&C's menu has changed over time for the better.  There are now plenty of options no matter what time of day you visit... from breakfast served all day, sandwiches, salads, bowls, etc... if you are open to eating healthy, you're sure to find something you like!  I recently went for the Greek Quinoa Salad with salmon and avocado and it was delicious.  I also recommend getting an Arnold Palmer with their homemade lavender lemonade.    Note: F&C prices are a little steep... (almost double what you'll pay next door at Chop Shop), but the quality is high, the service is friendly and patient, and it's nice to mix it up a bit!  Hope to return soon for some avocado + egg white protein toast.",

Of course, it's great to know which items are gluten free or vegan, but there is no way that certain items reduce stress. That's just an outlandish claim!  I think I picked the wrong items when I visited Farm & Craft previously because I went this week and loved it! One member of our group was gluten free so we started with two gluten free apps. The avocado hummus and the spinach and artichoke dip.  Both are served with some veggies and really good pita (especially considering that it was gluten free). Also, if you check in on Yelp, the avocado hummus is complimentary!   For my entree, I ordered that tocoa steak bowl, which has steak, farro, corn, sweet potato, black beans, and some guacamole.  It's actually not much of a bowl because all the items were on separate areas of the plate, but you could mix them together if you wanted! I preferred them separate. I thought this dish was really tasty and a good portion size!  I would recommend Farm & Craft to someone who likes creative, healthy food!",

The food was fresh, prepared well, and I felt really good while eating it. I would recommend the poke bowl to anyone who likes seafood in a heartbeat. I loved that there was enough salmon and avocado to have at least one piece in every bite!   The food and drinks are a little bit pricey, but I like to think that I'm paying for the overall experience, and a once in a while splurge is not a bad thing. I'd say that the general ambience, the cute atmosphere, good service and delicious food was worth every penny. We had a great time!",

I came with a good friend of mines and the place was quite busy for a Thursday night.  We first sat at the bar to order our drinks before sitting down.  For starters we ordered the Hummus and Pitas.  A good start overall; you can really taste the flax seed pita and the sweet homemade hummus with watermelon radish was a delight; texture of crispiness meets smooth creamy bite!  For our entrees my partner ordered the Tocoa Steak Bowl while I shot for the Cali Chicken.  I didn't get to try the Tocoa Steak Bowl, but the Cali Chicken Bowl came on a bed of Quinoa, a kale salad mixed with asparagus, edamame, heirloom tomatoes, endive, jack cheese, and quarter of a avocado.  Overall, it was heavily laden with ingredients, but it didn't make you feel full.  I love the texture of the crisp asparagus mixed with the edamame in the kale salad which was lightly blanched; thus retaining it's texture also.  The cheese and tomatoes gave it a sweet bite, while the avocado was there, but who doesn't love avocados!?    In the end, Farm & Craft is a hip contemporary clean eating restaurant.  I really enjoyed our service and plan to make it back for another round to order the pressed concoctions of healthy drinks! - Enjoy!",

I don't know if this is how their cold brew normally tastes but it was so watered down and had no flavor. I literally had to tell the waitress that I didn't like it and got a water instead. My wife's kombucha that she ordered was actually really good though. They were only having brunch when we were there so I got the egg white scramble with sweet potato and chicken sausage. The dish was good overall but it definitely needed some more salt and I thought that it would have been nice if they added some veggies to it. My wife got the turkey wrap and she enjoyed that. It was just an okay experience and a little overpriced. I would come back for a happy hour or try something different in the future.",

I guess it's one of the few restaurants in the country that offers kombucha cocktails, they said.  My friends ordered the Farmhouse Flatbread with chicken sausage, fennel, asparagus, tinker bell pepper and mozzarella. Pretty good flatbread, I must say.  From photos right here on Yelp, I decided to order the farro Mac and cheese with the salmon as an added protein. The sustainable salmon came out first with the flatbreads. Then awkwardly after we were almost done eating, my farro Mac and cheese finally came out.  I didn't understand because one of the girls ordered the exact same thing as I did but with Brussel sprouts too in addition to the salmon and the farro. It was plated all together on a single plate instead of separate plates like mine and it came out with the flatbreads. I was super hungry trying to wait for mine to come out so I could eat it together with the salmon. You might say I was \"hangry.\"   Ultimately, strangeness aside, the farro Mac and cheese was the True standout that evening! Don't hesitate to order the farro. The salmon does go really well with it too. I couldn't help but taste my friend's Brussel sprouts and wish I ordered them too! Next time, I will!",

My fiance's brother and his girlfriend are super clean eaters and vegetarian so they were stoked to try it. The ambiance is incredible. I love love it! Super trendy and hip.  However, the music. It. Was. So. Loud. I could not even hear the person next to me. We were shouting at each other. My fiance's mom and I are both prone to migraines and we just couldn't handle it so we had to leave and go somewhere else nearby. I was so bummed! Our waitress was very understanding and mentioned that she too thought the music was loud.   Make that easy change and we'll be back! ;)",

    "text": "Healthy food doesn't have to be bland and tasteless. Unfortunately Farm and Craft didn't get that message. We recently went there for dinner and drinks. Several of us got the Steak Tacoa along with the Farrow Mac and Cheese. The Steak was dry and under seasoned and the farro with the dish was bland. The only semi redeeming part was the cole slaw, and that was on par with what you'd expect for decent cole slaw. We also tried the wild mushroom flatbread which I was looking forward to because it looked great. Came with a heap of arugala on it and the crust had a nice char. Unfortunately it fell flat with the first bite. The sauce had a strange sweet and sour taste to it (not the typical tomato-y delicious acidic sweetness but something else) and the crust was strange and had an unpleasant taste and chew. I think they were trying too hard to make it \"healthy\". The final insult was the Farro \"Mac\" and Cheese. There was no Mac. It was just cheese sauce and farro. It was also decent, probably the best part of the meal by comparison. However the cheese sauce was a bit grainy (either tasted powdered or like they didn't prepare the roux correctly). It, like everything else, was also under seasoned.  We got drinks as well. They were out of the Berry Slim and Trim so several of us got The Cure. After tasting it we all agreed that is was the cure...for not wanting to drink again. I love veggie juices and juice at home regularly, including with kale and cucumber. Something about this was just off. Also, there was barely any vodka in it. If it's gonna taste terrible at least make it strong! Another friend got one of the Kombucha cocktails, that was actually quite good compared to everything else.   The service was good so at least there was that. There was also a DJ blasting music which was a little weird for dinner at a \"health food\" restaurant, however the music he played was pretty awesome. We all agreed he was the best part of the evening and that Farm and Craft should ditch their kitchen, fire their mixologist (or let him/her make some better flavor combinations) and just turn the place into a club.  Will be sticking with Flower Child and Pomegranate Cafe for my future healthy outings.",

    "text": "Great environment, decent food, and dog friendly. We had a pretty good experience until all of our food came out and a woman (I think a manager) informed me my protein pancakes were unavailable...as everyone else at our table was receiving their food. No problem;  I ordered a breakfast sandwich instead. The food was pretty good - we had two breakfast sandwiches and an avocado toast at our table. I highly recommend the House latte, which is delicious. When the bill came, my breakfast sandwich was not on the bill, so we figured it was comped, which we thought was super considerate of them and totally made up for the pancake problem. However, when our (super great until this point) server took the cash to get change, she brought back the change with a new bill with my breakfast sandwich now on it. This would have been okay since they never offered to comp the dish in the first place; however, the server  did not acknowledge the change. This really ended our experience on a sour note. What I thought would be a new Old Town favorite is now just another spot we aren't excited to return to.",

    "text": "I reserve to revise in the future, as this restaurant just opened but my initial experience wasn't great. Came for dinner.  Music was waaayyyyy too loud. Annoying when you're trying to talk to your friends.  Deafness aside, I saw this new place recently when going to my usual healthy haunt next door, the Original Chop Shop. Oddly, both the menu and interior look like siblings, or at least first cousins. I'm sure Chop Shop is not pleased.   However, Farm & Craft has a bar and that will probably be a bigger draw then the food (at least at this point). Ordered one of the Bowls with chicken.  My friend ordered the same thing but with salmon. After eating we thought the portions were a little small but the deal breaker was the overwhelming taste of SALT. Both dishes we had were sodium overload. How can you lure customers in as a healthy option but slowly kill them with salt????  We both felt like we drank a glass of the Pacific Ocean. Yuck.  Atmosphere is better then Chop Shop and the outdoor seating and bar are cool but given the cost and actual food, I'd go to Chop Shop or drive to Flower Child or True Food if I want to know I won't leave saline-ed and will get a True organic experience. I'll give it another shot in the future.  Cool spot and bar but food needs some tweaking. Kudos for bringing a potentially healthier option, but why next door to an already great and guaranteed healthy place???",

    "text": "I have been here twice since the restaurant opened and was excited to check out a new healthy concept in Old Town.  My first impression when I walked in - wow this really reminds me of Flower Child and True Food.  The Farm to table concept isn't new.  And it seems that Riot Hospitality Group (El Hefe/Whiskey Row) has caught on to the trend of healthy and fresh and is trying to capitalize on it.  Honestly wasn't much new or original about this place that impressed me.  I think what Sam Fox or Chop House has developed is excellent - they know their audience and they cater to it.  There is something about this place that is amiss...  The first time I walked in for lunch solo, I was greeted warmly and the hostess explained the menu and restaurant concept quite well.  I beat the lunch rush so the restaurant wasn't overly crowded.  I ordered the Rustic Farm bowl and an iced tea and sat at the high top long table.  When I received my lunch and noticed I would have to cut the large vegetables myself, I was surprised that all they offered for lunch were cheap plastic knives and forks.  It would be nice if they offered real silverware to make it easier to cut the hard bokchoy!  Iced tea options are great - even the ice was same as flower child. The second time I came I stopped by for lunch with my best friend.  It was packed and we sat outside.  I ordered the farro mac and cheese.  Again, it seemed like a knock off of the mac & cheese at flower child with a different pasta. I think this place has potential to be great if they figure out they come up with something slightly original and get to know their audience and cater to it, rather than trying to be trendy and gimmickry.  We shall see!",

The wine was refreshing and the hummus was one of the best I've ever had.  Good selection of veggies and pita to enjoy the all the heavenly hummus.  Ambiance was great as we sat at the outdoor bar, and viewed all the foot/auto action on Scottsdale Rd.  This place is always crowded and we've tried several times to stop in - so glad we got lucky and found seats at the bar - will definitely be back soon.",

I ordered a flatbread as an app, and the lasagne as the dinner. They both showed up together, at the same time as the beer finally arrived.  None of them paired well together, so I gnawed threw for a bit and then said screw it and left.  Wish I would have trusted my gut and avoided anyplace on this strip of touristy low quality crap.",

Do you want to feel healthy and not bloated and food-coma-y when you walk out the door?  If so, Farm & Craft might be your new favorite restaurant.  Farm & Craft has two different locations, one in Scottsdale and one in the North Phoenix region.  I'd visited the North Phoenix site a few weeks back and wanted to bring my husband along to try the Scottsdale location.  The first thing we noticed - this is the place to be on a Saturday night.  Call to reserve a table if you're time-limited.  We luckily were able to snag the last table and didn't have to wait, but this place was hopping, and there definitely could be a wait.  Service was excellent, and the food was outstanding.  Prices are high, but I'm fine paying a little extra for a healthy meal.  I especially recommend the burrata and the avocado hummus appetizers.  Almost every plate came with fresh roasted vegetables.  Farm & Craft is able to alter pretty much every dish to fit your dietary needs, so if you're a vegan/caveman/meatatarian, let them know and they'll likely be able to help you out.  We also had The Cure, which is a kale/cucumber vodka cocktail.  There's a huge selection of alcoholic vegetable drinks (lol) at this site, and I can't wait to come back and try more.",

However, what was interesting was that half of the tables in the restaurant were empty... and we waited for nearly an hour.  To kill some time, we decided to order some drinks. The bartender was impatient and rolled her eyes at us when we were not ready to order. The drinks were mediocre at best.

I am convinced the ambience of Farm & Craft makes the food better! I really enjoyed my crustless quiche with side salad, the kale was not to over powering and great compliment to turkey sausage.   The star of my meal.. The mimosicles!  Step 1. Order.. Drink before the ice cube melts and re order a another glass of champagne for $1.00! I enjoyed three glasses for total of 13.00! The initial glass is 10 bucks to get you started.. Keep eye on your ice cube and make sure you get best bang for buck with multiple refills! Uber here for brunch so you arrive home safely and enjoy!   I have new fave.. a place to bring out town guest! I am fan and love Farm & Craft!",

It's very bright and airy and nice to sit outside on their patio and watch the cars drive by on Scottsdale rd and people watch and compare which dogs are cuter but not as cute as your own, ha . They have healthy cuisine options to choose from with an amazing homemade siracha sauce available for purchase called \"Fix\". My bf and I typically come here for mimosas where they have fresh squeezed juice. Their grapefruit mimosas are pretty freaking tasty not going to lie. A dapper young man named Connor was our server and super friendly and attentive. He brought the manager Andrew over for me to meet who also suggested several other yummy restaurants owned under the same umbrella. The service here is top notch and will definitely be back. You hit the nail on the head guys, thank you for a fun experience!!",

I had my dog with me so was immediately drawn to it during my Yelp search. Pet friendly outdoor seating, as well as indoor seating. A great indoor-outdoor bar. You order inside at the back counter and seat yourself. Be sure to check in via Yelp because you get a $11 avocado hummus for FREE! Why haven't I had avo hummus before this?!? I got the salmon poke and tried the pancakes with bacon. The salmon poke bowl was fresh and filling. The pancakes are technically on the kid's menu, but again, a generous portion. All the staff were super friendly and helpful. It's nice to be able to get out of a car after over 5 hours of driving and eat a deliciously healthy meal al fresco with a happy dog at my feet!",

Waiter came back and asked for my orders again and told me that they were very busy after 30min of seating here waiting. The kitchen being slammed is about the worst excuse I've gotten in years! You just can't use that after people after us have gotten their food. Nice manager came out and comped the meal...so this star is for her. Bad service, slow, loud music!

I refrained from writing a review from my last visit because I find that people get carried away over one bad experience. I was in again last night and it was slow, so slow they decided to close early, (maybe around 8-9) which is totally fine and understandable. But my food took forever, which has been a reoccurring event. (Always about 30-45 mins for something that should take 15, after I have to remind them I had food put in.) I got my food and closed my check, and left it on the counter. The server with a very bold icy white haircut then proceeded to ask me if I was finished signing because he needed to \"run his checkout\", which I found rude and tactless, then continued to stack all the chairs around us. I get it, it's the holiday season, but you don't stack chairs in a restaurant until your last guest leaves, especially if you're closing two hours early. I felt rushed and my whole experience was handled so unprofessionally.",

We both pushed it around our plate. Woody, dry, like eating sticks. Definitely skip.  We also ordered the Brussels sprouts-very good and the hummus-ok. The whole wheat pita was chalky and dry. Some good veggies to go with it would have made it more appealing.  The oddest part of the whole dining experience was they gave us plastic utensils. Even when I am busy and eat at my desk, I pull out real silverware. Definitely tacky.   For now we'll stick to the places around there that have their food worked out-chop shop and herb box.",

I had the Open Faced Salmon on pita and he had the Kale Caesar with chicken. We kept nibbling off of each other's plates because both tasted SO good! The mac n cheese was also our favorite side, so we ended up ordering a second serving of it to go! We plan to visit this weekend for brunch and have no doubt it will be great!",

Also, they were out of chicken at 7:30 on a Saturday night. Really?!?! My friend asked for her salmon to be more on the rare side. Which it was not. My friend complained and they did take it off the bill which was nice. She had ordered soup as an appetizer and they didn't bring it out with my app--we had to ask for it to be brought out. We asked for the check and when it came, we put our cards down. No one came back for the bill so eventually my friend got up and brought it over. I think they realized how crappy the service had been so they actually took off 15% off the bill. Maybe they have better staff or operations for brunch but I have little patience for bad service and I would not go back to this place. Especially considering the food was just okay.",

Trying to keep it light, I had the avocado toast and a side of bacon and was delighted with how fresh it all tasted. I had a kombucha (that they have on tap!) tequila and it was a perfectly refreshing break in the day.   I would have been happy if it ended here, but I even had the opportunity to talk to the GM and she was very knowledgeable and helpful. It was great to see someone who was so attentive to the customers while also helping her staff. This is going to become a frequent weekend lunch spot!   I would absolutely recommend a stop for anyone looking to relax and enjoy some delicious and healthy food.",

However the food was way overpriced for what it was.  I got the Breakfast sandwich which was small & mostly bread. Such a huge bread bun, I had to cut in half on each side which left an even smaller sandwich. Flavor was good & fresh but way too expensive for how small it is.  My husband ordered the breakfast burrito which was ok but again small & the tortilla/bread it was wrapped in was way too much bread. He even tore off some of the wrap. Disappointed. I also got a greyhound drink & the girl at the front said it comes in a grapefruit, which sounded different & interesting. But when I got it, there was hardly any juice or vodka in it. It was an $11 cocktail that was a novelty. Total rip-off imo. I regretted not getting the cocktail in a glass & actually getting my moneys worth. They couldn't possibly fit a regular cocktail inside a grapefruit unless it was hollowed out. I give this place 2 stars for the nice ambiance. The service was mediocre & food / drink disappointing. Won't be back.",

I had the Burrata and Grilled Veggies and the other three all had breakfast items.   Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food, however, the service was terrible. From the time that we sat down until we got 2 of our drinks and our waters, it was over 45 minutes. We asked the waitress at the next table over if she could find our waitress and while her answer was \"sure\", the dirty look she gave us said otherwise. 15 minutes later our waitress showed up with our 2 coffees, our food, but no cream or sugar. We asked for those items and she brought the last 2 items for our food. I asked for salt and pepper for my food as well, and felt the need to apologize for asking for it. The glare from the waitress when I did ask essentially validated my need to apologize for the request. All in all, it took nearly 2 1/2 hours to get our food and we felt we were interrupting whatever she had planned for that day by showing up at all. I'm not sure what her name was, little blonde girl with her hair up in a messy bun.   We'll try it again the next time we're up there because the food was that good and we're just hoping the service was a fluke.",

Order at the counter and they bring the food to you.   The ambiance is 11/10 - great music, spacious, open. Perfect place for business or a date.   I'd go here everyday if I could!",

I have never had avocado hummus before and it was delicious. I had the Tocoa steak and husband had the lasagne bolognese. Both were excellent! Steak was very tender and tasty with the  black bean, sweet potato farro mix. I do not eat lasagne out much but had a taste of the spouse's! It was delicious! Pasta not mushy but more al dente. Waiter, Juan, was for most part, attentive. Environment was alive but not crazy hectic! Would definitely recommend!",

On both occasions the food was great and the kids portions are reasonably priced.  My wife enjoyed the kombucha and cucumber beverage, and the beer selection is really good.  We would provide 5 stars, if the kids could have an \"unhealthy\" side option, like chips or fries (as parents we didn't mind, though).  Kevin, thanks for reaching out to us, and Andrew for resolving the first visit disappointment.",

The brussel sprouts lacked any real flavor and the dried cranberries and walnuts seemed like an after thought or bad garnish instead of part of the dish. Still wanting something to pick at while we drank, we ordered the nachos with chicken. I understand that Farm & Craft is known for their healthier options, but this one lacked any real favor. The chicken was dry and bland and clearly not intended for this dish. The salsa tasted like someone blended tomatillos into a cup of vinegar.   Our waitress was outstanding and even offered to remove the nachos from our bill after seeing how little we ate. We'd go back for drinks and the service, but I would skip eating there.",

It's so naturally sweet that you can drink the whole thing under 2 mins. Sit at the bar and watch the magic happen. Not too sure about the food there but stop by and grab a drink.",

The host took the flatbread off of our bill which was very nice of him. Good staff, awful food. The desserts were horrendous too. For example, the brownie was super dry with no flavor.

Then we got seated on the patio, we ordered a quinoa salad add chicken, friend got the grass fed burger and a side of red sauce pasta. The server was so rude and did not want to accommodate for any of our needs. She had attitude as well, and it showed all over her face when we'd ask her things. I did not like what I had ordered, and she gave me the rudest look. Will never go there again. Chop shop is the way to go if you want a healthy meal and friendly service.",

First night decided upon Farm and Craft and we ate every bite or took to-go! Fresh is an understatement in regards to the greens, fish, veggies and fruits our yummy dishes had to offer. We had the spinach and artichoke dip appetizer, strawberry goat cheese spinach salad, kale pesto chicken pizza, and farm salmon bowl. We took our leftovers back to hotel for a delicious next day lunch. No question will be returning to this spot on our visit! Thank you so much!",

But unfortunately the food was actually quite bland, overpriced, and underwhelming.   We were actually on the way to another restaurant when we turned around to come here because it SEEMED like it was going to be a wonderful experience.    We had 6 people in our party, so we were able to try several different menu items.  Everything came out bland and very small.  The chicken was dry, the eggs were way under-seasoned, and the portions were more like what we get at a tapas bar.  We felt horrible for our waitress who had to drop off the plates at the table and see everybody's faces.   We will stick to our usual brunch places.",

Definitely not your pick if you're looking for some comfort food, or wanna get overstuffed on large portions. This place is a pretty good representation of well balanced and nutritional food. Keep up the great work Farm + Craft. Can't wait to see the ways your menu changes once the seasons do! :)",

There were two blonde girls helping us and they were both very attentive. But then around 12 they brought on an additional couple bartenders and for some reason the more people the added the more dysfunctional everything became. We ended up waiting 20 minutes for them to take our next drink order, and after watching them for another 10 and they hadn't started making them, we asked for our check which was another 10 minute process. I've been a bartender for years and honestly the other two guys they brought on seemed hungover and in the way of the girls that had been working so hard in the first place. It was just a cluster*** and I won't be going back anytime soon.",

Today, I put my name on the waitlist and was told the wait was around 5-10 minutes. My friend and I waited 30 minutes and watched people coming in after us getting seated with no reservations. When I confronted the hostess, she immediately became defensive and made up some ridiculous excuse about how I missed a text? So I showed her my phone, where I received a confirmation that I was in line but never that a table was ready. Then the manager got involved, who seemed to have an axe to grind. He said that I shouldn't take out my frustration on the hostess. Really? Maybe you should train your hostess to do her job, and to be accountable for her mistakes? I would highly recommend you reconsider giving this establishment their business, as they will not appreciate yours.",

We ordered brunch around 9:30 and were not served the food till 10:20. Essentially we watched people that were seated after us finish their meals, pay their tabs, and leave before we were served. When were were served, the eggs were burnt, the bacon was ultra fatty (only 10% was edible, the rest was yellow fat), and the toast was so stale.  The waiter was super apologetic, stating that it was unacceptable (with regard to the wait time for being served). A $5 discount and a free coffee were applied to the total check (lol). I want to love this place, the decor is very cute and it's in a great location;however based on service (specifically the kitchen) and quality of food, I'd recommend against dining here.",

Upon first being greeted at our table, my guest and I both felt unnecessary attitude from our waitress, the restaurant ran out of the cocktail I wanted to order, and the appetizer I wanted to order. Not only were they not proficiently stocked on their basic ingredients, they also were out of an entree ingredient and the only other option available, they charged me for. They fixed the check only after saying it's been a common mistake today. It's the eveningtime Huns, if it's been a common mistake, I would hope you learn from them. I had to walk and find my waitress to get our checks. Overall, very unimpressed with this visit. Oh, and my martini tasted like cucumber. I asked if she could see how the bartender made it and I never received a response. I had a wonderful time with my lunch date, but this restaurant and waitress totally blew my experience.

I haven't seen any problems with the service, although it varies depending on the time... at dinner the servers come to your table while at lunch you order at the counter and they bring you your food.  My only complaint would be that the music is loud and the acoustics are bad so that it is almost impossible to have a conversation at your table, It's definitely not a place to have an intimate meal, but if you want something healthy, hip, and happening, Farm and Craft is a great addition to Old Town Scottsdale.",

We apologized to the server, who mentioned she too thought it was too loud and had mentioned it to the manager, but to no avail.

The hostess asked my husband for his phone number to call him for when our table will be ready. He says I'm right here, you don't need to call me. While we are waiting we look at the menu that is posted on the wall and see many things we are interested in only to find out latter that these items aren't actually offered until 3 o'clock.   We get seated in about 5 minutes and when the hostess pulls the chair out for me I see that it is wet with three good sized spills of water. I look at the hostess and she just smiles and doesn't say or do anything.....so I unravel the silverware and dry up the chair myself. Afterwards she said she'd bring me a new napkin.  I wasn't expecting a BRUNCH Menu because the whole menu is posted on their website as of yesterday 7-16-16. We asked about the items we were interested in and our server wasn't aware that these items weren't on the menu. The server said they offer everything at 3 o'clock.  I soon receive my Strawberry and Goat Cheese Salad with added Chicken ($13.00). The spinach didn't look like packed spinach and looked farm grown because it was the bigger leaves. The strawberries were the really delicious kind and don't taste like cardboard like the kind you buy from the store. The Goat Cheese was very good quality that was mild and very creamy. The chicken was flavorful but a little dry on the end pieces. I'm guessing the amount of chicken breast was about 2 ounces. I thought it was a good salad.  My husband had the steak sandwich. He asked for horseradish instead of horseradish sauce. His sandwich came slathered with very hot horseradish. It was too hot in some places and he should have asked them to put the horseradish on the side because he didn't think someone would put the very hot horseradish on so heavy. The bread that made up the sandwich was very good. The beef in the sandwich was good but it also seemed like two ounces. An eye catching fancy vegetable salad came with the sandwich that tasted very mildly flavored.  Don't know if they do this all the time but they offered us complimentary hot fresh vegan cookies. Tasty but slightly greasy.  I would come back for the food but would prefer a patio seat when the weather is right because the music was too loud for me.   My husband would not because his platter didn't satisfy him and he complained to me that he was still hungry.  3.5 stars - in the end the food was good and this restaurant is newly opened so I rounded the stars up.",

I went to the counter to order food and was greeted by the friendly cashier. She was helpful in my drink selections and had me sample a few item. I chose their brewed teas and they were amazing. I sat at the table and waited for my food. It took a while to get my food given that there weren't too many people in the building. I ordered the salmon and two asides. When I got my food I noticed the salmon was very grilled. When I started to eat it, it was over cooked and dry. I also had the mac and upon tasting it, you could taste the cheese was over cooked and had a burned taste. The best part was the broccoli with chili and cheese topping, it was perfectly cooked. I was disappointed in the quality for the 25 dollar lunch I had. The workers also did not smile or greet anyone.",

The idea of farm to table is magnificent and I appreciate them being in business due to our dietary restrictions.   Truthfully today I wanted to leave a 2 or 3 star review, because for the second time they just decided to close early, because the restaurant was slow. It's a Friday night and you closed your restaurant at 9pm?!?!?! What?!?!? Adjust your hours if you have to, but it's very frustrating to drive to the restaurant (for the second time) to have it be closed 2 hours ahead of the posted time.",

We ate inside but all of the windows were open and it felt great! This is a fast casual situation where you order and then they bring it to you. Serves breakfast and has a full bat menu. I went this route...choose your protein: soy, chicken, beef, or salmon. And then about 15 sides $4ea. (I ordered salmon $7 and grilled brussel sprouts with bacon). Hubby ordered  turkey wrap. Food came quickly enough. My salmon was a smallish portion, about 3 ounces, but it was thick and perfectly cooked. I was disappointed that they didnt season it! The brussel sprouts were burnt on the outside and hard/uncooked on the inside... bacon was yummy :) hubby liked his well enough. His side salad was crisp and fresh with a very light, tasty dressing, but he said he was still hungry so he bought a $3 cookie. It was good! Not sure if we will be back to give them another try. There are just so many interesting places to eat, why settle?",

Healthy Food. The food options are all pretty healthy so you don't have to feel guilty about eating there! We started with the avocado hummus, and I have to tell you- it is delicious. My kids love it as well. I would go just for that honestly. I love their mashed cauliflower and other veggie sides as well. We went for brunch and my kids got their kids pancake. Wow! I tasted it and it was so good. It came with bacon and strawberries- the portion size was great. Drinks. I had the \"forbidden\" fruit which was a hollowed out watermelon with cucumber vodka. My daughter had the non alcoholic version that had coconut water in it. It was fun! I saw a couple other cocktails that I would like to try as well. They also have kombucha cocktails!!!",

The prices are reasonable.  Our only gripe - the TV over the bar blinks in and out every couple of seconds which is weirdly maddening if you happen to face the bar while eating. Please fix it!

(Which I don't believe you should hold against them)  The food is unique and more for people who are health consciousness. If you don't know what \"kale\" is or if your looking for a cold draft american beer with a cheeseburger piled high with all the trimmings, I would suggest that you look elsewhere.   I was in a group of a total of 4 people and we ordered a variety of food. No complaints about any of the items.  Farm and Craft seems to had healthy delicious food in mind as well as beverages that are not loaded with sugar or artificial flavors. In a nutshell, tasty food that makes you feel good and not feel guilty after eating it.   The atmosphere is trendy and classy, the bathrooms and dining area was well maintained and clean.   Food came out in a timely manner. And priced very well when considering the high quality of ingredients and the nice look/ambiance of the dining area.  Service was fast and friendly.  I will definitely be back!",

This was my first time at the Scottsdale location. It was pretty busy, one think I didn't like was how long we sat at our table before anyone asked us if we wanted water. Then it seemed like a long time before our waiter came over. The waiter was kind and pleasant. The food was fresh and good. I am a lover of spice so the avocado hummus was a little bland for my taste. But the spinach and artichoke dip did not disappoint it was one of the best I have ever had. I like the fact that this food is good and filling but you don't feel bloated after you leave. I recommend it especially if you have a mix of meat eaters and vegans hanging out. There is something for everyone's",

Honestly, the service was really bad. We were seated quickly as we had a reservation but it was a long time before someone even approached our table to take our drink order. The waitress appeared to spend most of her time behind the computer at the front desk and we sat for about 25 minutes before she took our order. It seemed like they did not have enough wait staff or this girl was just trying to avoid doing her job.   We ordered the avocado hummus which was quite good and a nice refreshing appetizer. Other than that, the food was just okay. I love healthy food, but everything was just bland and not what I'd expect when going out to eat. I got the Tocoa Steak Bowl and others in my party ordered the fried rice. The fried rice looked very basic and the chicken was dry and bland. While the food wasn't bad, I feel like I could have made it better at home.   I didn't order drinks, but the drink menu was large and had a lot of good options. This place seems better for happy hour and drinks rather than for dinner.",

They changed it during the week to fast casual where you walk up and order which for the prices I feel like is not justifiable.

For a lunch spot it was great, portions weren't too big but everything tasted amazing. The build your own bowl was the way to go! However, their flatbreads also looked delish! I ordered the build your own with steak, Brussel sprouts with crispy bacon bites and a wonderful white cheddar cauliflower mash! It was soo good, I already want to go back for more! It paired great with a large cold fresh lemonade (which you could refill and take to go)! My coworkers went with the bowls as well and raved about the fennel Mac and cheese, with tender chicken!  I was seeing a lot of salads ordered too and the sizes were big!! It looked like breakfast was served until 3pm too which Always is a bonus!  The patio area was nice and dog friendly!! All in all this place was wonderful! Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "my experience was not the best.  I ordered a sandwich from the breakfast menu and I asked if it could be made vegetarian. All they had to do was remove the bacon....  however, 20 minutes of waiting later I find that instead of the key ingredients I received two uncooked buns with a slice of avocado and mayonnaise.   I literally laughed because I was so confused with my \"meal\".   but, that is not truly what made me upset. after bringing up how it wasn't really what I ordered the waitress explained how it was my fault because I changed the menu and that confuses the chefs.  what the heck! I just asked to remove the bacon - not everything but avocado and a squirt of mayonnaise. whomever is in charge of making this stuff should be able to remove bacon and for it to still be good.  my waitress was sub-par and a bit unprofessional, as of now I won't disclose their name because they may have simply been having a bad day.  On a positive note, the host was incredible. we were quick to be seated and they were quick to remove my sandwich from the tab because of its lack of sandwiching.  If you're okay with being stomped on by a rude waitress or an excuse for food, then come! because after they mess up they won't make you pay cash, just time.",

Fortunately we were seated right away (11am on a Sunday) but many people milled around while they were waiting for a table. Emily was our server and she was on it- and busy. This is one of the places that it would be nice if they would just put a water carafe on the table. Their check-in yelp offer is avocado hummus which is very generous- about a $11 value.  It was scrumptious and I would have loved it even if it wasn't free. We had lavender lemonade and a kale juice- both very refreshing.  Our lunches were all delicious. They promote themselves as having fresh healthy food and it was.  It is a very loud restaurant and there is limited indoor seating so if you don't like loud music you may want to choose another place or sit outside.",

    "text": "I chose to try Farm & Craft after hiking Camelback and thank goodness this place literally brought me back to life. Some of the staff was pretty friendly and welcoming and some acted like I was the biggest inconvenience. I saw a chai beer on tap that I wanted to sample so I asked the man behind the counter what it was. I was expecting some elaborate description of the type of beer, flavors to expect (aside from the obvious chai), brewer, location, etc etc etc, but instead, all he said was, \"it's a beer.\" Ummm...DUH!? I was a bit surprised at the attitude, but the rest of the employees were pretty friendly and a lot easier to talk to. We ended up ordering the rustic farm salmon bowl, penne mac n cheese, and the sweet potato hash and we got the avacado hummus free when I checked in. The avocado hummus is $11 on the menu so I thought that was a super generous check-in offer, and it was delicious!!! It came with yummy flax pita bread and carrot sticks and cauliflower. It was creamy and had wonderful balance of flavors and texture. The salmon bowl was also so good. The salmon was cooked nicely, a little seared around the edges so it had that nice crunch but the meat was tender. I loved the idea of pesto quinoa and it has inspired some of my cooking at home. The man n cheese was okay...the chickpea pasta was kind of crumbly but tasted good and the cheese was kind of chunky - imagine heavy cream and grated parmesan.... but the flavor was nice. I love sweet potatoes and I didn't care too much for the sweet potato hash; it had a strong grilled onion flavor and the sweet potatoes weren't very sweet or cooked enough. I ended up taking this home and repurposing it the next morning with eggs and sauteed bell peppers. Last, we ordered the gluten free brownie with vanilla coconut ice cream. HOLY SMOKES! The brownie was cakey but had melted chocolate chips baked inside that gave it a more fudgey texture. They said the ice cream was dairy free but I couldn't tell; it was AMAZING. I scarfed it down. Happy hour begins at 2pm and I would definitely go back for the salmon bowl and avocado hummus and maybe try a drink or a coffee. Beautiful open space with lots of light.",

Starving, we ate our food: a salad, pancakes and avocado toast. It was very good!  However, our waitress never came back to refill our waters or to check in on us. They only time we saw her again is when she gave us our bill. When she came back, we discovered that she charged us the wrong bill amount and had to do it do a refund and run the card again for the correct amount. But at least she apologized that time! It was a very disappointing experience. While the food and atmosphere were nice, it wasn't nice enough to make me want to come back.",

First server took order and delivered food entrees, told us our side of mac n' cheese would be forthcoming.  I had the steak sandwich.  It fell apart when I took my first bite because bread was soggy.  Waited for server to come back so I could request a wrap to replace my soggy bread, but server never checked back on us.  About ten minutes later, (after my friend had finished eating) another server delivered the mac n' cheese.  I requested the wrap which she promised she would get, but it never happened.  So after another ten minutes, I gave up on that and ate my steak with a fork. My friend substituted a gluten free wrap for which they up-charged $2.50.   Bill came to $37 for two sandwiches, a side of mac n' cheese, and a beverage.  Cool concept, but over-priced and poorly executed.",

Food was alright, pretty pricey for what you got. We came here for breakfast. Nothing stood out to be that great. I probably won't come back for breakfast but maybe I'll have to try their lunch out.  I ordered the avocado toast and chia pudding. Both very small.",

I went with a few friends and our order included the gluten free chicken salad wrap, and two of the create your own bowls. One had the salmon, Brussels sprouts, and broccolini while the other had the beef, sweet potato hash, and farro mac and cheese. All of our food was delicious as was evident by your clean plates. My favorite was the broccolini which had a hint of heat with chili flakes. All of the food was fresh, and cooked perfectly. We also had a bottle of the house rose which was crisp and refreshing. The staff was also delightful and attentive. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants delicious and flavorful healthy food.",

I had the spinach, black bean bowl and asked for eggs on the side so I can give to the husband (because originally he thought he was going to starve due to no substance) The waitress was spot on. Filled our glasses every time when running low. It did take awhile for the food to come out. Some of our group who ordered last had gotten their food right when the peeps who ordered first had just finished theirs. We did separate checks, and put it towards our big group. Not normal. I will def be back. The only grip is the pets. Which looked to only take place outside, thank goodness. People are allergic to pet dander, so I don't really understand the bring your pet to a relaxing get out breakfast where others are around. I love my dog, and we get out. But not at eating joints.

    "text": "Found this little gem on Yelp and glad we tried it! The menu seems a tad confusing at 1st but the lady at the front quickly explained it to us and it became very clear. You order the style or items you want and add the protein or you're welcome to make up your own. Salads all looked great but we decided on the Cali with which had edamame, quiona, kale, cheese and we added chicken. Delicious! We thought the portion seemed small but it was plenty! We got the flatbread with artichokes, chicken, carmelized onions, fig balsamic and kale pesto. Absolutely delicious. The staff was all very nice. I'd definitely go back and try some other stuff. Lastly, when I went to refill my tea, it was in a different spot next to one of servers cutting lemons with NO gloves. Ew. I'm glad I didn't have lemon in my tea because I would've definitely said something.",

Where else can you find 6 kombucha and alcohol mixers on the menu?  The chicken tacos were really wonderful and the Kale Caesar salad was okay and perhaps the mushroom flatbread was lackluster because of the eeny-mini mushrooms.  Our waiter was kind and considerate AND attractive, largely because of his very white teeth as my dinner date explained.   The restaurant itself was also attractive with its indoor/outdoor bar and mixed seating set-up and high ceilings. Happy to have found this gem in the midst of Old town Scottsdale.",

Came there for the watermelon but it they were out. Hummm juice bar 30 feet behind you.. but both my choice drink and the wine were great! Shared the salmon and strawberry goat nut salad was the bomb! Hostess had the mostest!! Great lil town there lots of nightlife and almost everyone in Scottsdale were really friendly !

    "text": "Hello friends!  I have been wanting to try farm and craft for a long time and have now been able to go twice in the last week or so.   The restaurant is supposed to be full service after 3pm and my friend and I found it to be so the first visit but yesterday it seemed as if they were understaffed so they told us  we had to order at that counter until 5pm.  My girlfriend and I had to open up several different tabs   yesterday for drink refills which was quite inconvenient (luckily we were paying cash).  The first time I had their rustic salmon bowl which was pretty good but I did have to add tapitio hot sauce (could have used a little more flavor and I am used to eating very clean and basic).  The most recent visit I had a strawberry salad with goat cheese and salmon and this was AHHMAZING!   Literally everything I dreamed of and more.  My friend got the salmon rustic bowl and she told me again it needed a bit more pizazz.  There was also no sunflower seeds in her bowl (they are listed on the menu) and we were told they were out.  Being in the industry I understand that things run out but sunflower seeds are inexpensive and easily sourced.  Both times we have visited we have asked for the artichoke dip out prior to our meals, but neither time did this happen (it came out with the entrees).  We love to sit on the patio to watch the people in old town and overall this is a good experience.  We will likely be back (we do love to eat clean and enjoy the atmosphere) but do have lower expectations and think for the price and the restaurant  group bringing us this concept things could be much better.",

There seems to be some inconsistency with the food. Today I ordered from their website because I was in a rush and had to be at a meeting. I ordered the chicken with cauliflower mash because I am trying to adhere to a low-carb diet. Photo of menu below and what I actually got.  I get back to my office and open the box and instead of low-carb items, I have barley and high carb vegetables. Very frustrating since I skipped breakfast and basically either have to break the diet or skip it altogether.  Parking is not convenient and tough to find.  On this visit, I parked some distance away and halfway back to my car, I glanced in the bag and no silverware or napkins.  I had to walk all the way back to the restaurant.  Today was a frustrating experience on many levels.",

I had a latte with almond milk which was quite watery but other than that the food and service were really good.  It's a very clean and modern set up with both inside and outside seating.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a yummy yet healthy breakfast!",

Soon, I had pieces that were not undercooked...but raw. Raw, like the meat you buy at grocery store and take home to cook. Not all of it was raw, but there was enough of it that I couldn't eat it and had to send it back. They did reheat it, but didn't even offer to take any part of it off the bill. Oh well, many more places in Scottsdale I can go.",

It works for me because it's fairly 'clean' and I have multiple food sensitivities, but it's just not 'right' yet. We ordered roasted seasonal veggies which came out raw. When we asked about the raw \"roasted\" veggies the server said they weren't roasting any veggies yet due to not having a roaster!  She should have told us that up front as we didn't want a bowl of raw veggies. Then I ordered the Rustic Bowl which was roasted veggies, quinoa and steak.  So, do they have a roaster?  Or not!  LOL My husband had the Farmhouse flatbread and he said it was really good. I like the style and idea of this place, and while not original, it was nice, simple, clean food. We may wait a few weeks and try again.",

I loved how their diet also pointed out different things you can eat based upon certain diets.  I am on a doctor imposed anti-inflammatory diet & it showed me what on the menu fit into that diet.  The drinks looked & sounded delicious but I can't currently drink :(  I did have the chocolate protein shake that fit pretty close to being in this crazy diet and actually tasted good.  I also go the Roast Brussel Sprouts, Broccolini with steak which was yummy!  I also got the strawberry & goat salad which was good.     Atmosphere: I thought it was quaint and felt very fresh.  It gave you that back to basic earthy feel.    Service:  Our waitress happened to be great.    Prices:  Go elsewhere if you want cheap GMO veggies from another country, meat product and other questionable chemical products.  Healthy truly \"natural\" food is rarely cheap these days.  Farm & Craft is in par price-wise with other restaurants similar.  Me cooking the same meal at home could possibly cost about the same here, so I didn't think the prices were bad at all.",

The staff isn't much better. Andrew (he's vegan btw), was AMAZING! Our waitress however, was rude and was not present. We only interacted with her once (to take our order), but she seemed to have vanished during her shift. No hi. No \"hello I'm so and so and I'll be helping you tonight\". NADA. We will never be coming back to Farm and Craft. Overpriced and to be honest, Chop Shop next door is the same style cuisine for half the price and is terrific!",

LOUD music at 9am can't hear myself thinking. Save yourself some frustration avoid, go to New Wave Market two steps away, similar menu, better service and less pretentious.

The drink menu is outstanding and very trendy, it includes kombucha mixed with alcohol and other slightly healthy sounding mixed alcoholic drinks. They have a great Rose deal too on the weekends.  If you're NOT up for drinking, their food is great too. My favorite breakfast here is the sausage and sweet potato hash with jasmine blackberry tea to drink.  For lunch or dinner I recommend the option to make your own. I love the sustainable salmon, carrots, ferro mac and cheese, and broccolini.   Service here for the most part has been good, though it seems like the last time I came here the service wasn't as good, which is why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5. One waitress did not know what our appetizer was called and so we had some confusion on what dish was ours. We also experienced not having our water refilled throughout our meal. Not a huge deal, but still inconvenient when you're thirsty.   I'll still be back though, healthy food options are always great, and I really likely the atmosphere.",

Big doors and windows open bring the outside in very nicely. Absolutely no complaints about the building.  The food and drink wasn't bad, but wasn't great.  The eggs were overdone. The bloody mary wasn't what you expect in the age of \"who can make the best bloody.\"  Again.....not terrible.  Just not memorable.  You really need memorable smack dab in the middle of Old Town.",

I ordered the American Breakfast - complete with scrambled egg whites, sweet potato hash, and chicken sausage. I was really impressed with the plate, and felt like the price was right for this area and the portion size. My friends and I also split the protein pancakes... YUM, they were sooo delicious - I would definitely recommend these! Not sure how healthy they could actually be, but it was the perfect sweet treat to top off our meal!  Aside from the vibes and tasty food, our server lacked in helpfulness and enthusiasm. As first timers, we hoped for better guidance on the menu and questions that we had. In addition to this, she wasn't very friendly in the slightest about it all. Regardless, I'll be back! But at a hip and trendy place like this, that has everything going for them, I hope this is one area they improve upon!",

I loved the applewood chicken sausage! I sat at the bar and the bartender was nice and attentive but just wished they were more friendly. No complaints, they did a good job. I'm just use to bartenders sparking conversations with me. However the area is beautiful, the food was great, the service was quick so overall I will be back! Soon...",

We arrived at 9:45am and got seated on the patio right away. There was a few other tables on the patio as well which is why I don't understand how we were completely ignored by the wait staff walking by. After 15 minutes, we watched 2 other tables get sat and greeted by their server right away. The hostess and 2 other servers even looked right at us sitting there with our menus but didn't seem to care to ask us if we had been helped yet.   We decided to leave since we didn't have time to continue waiting. When we approached the gentleman at the front who seated us (possibly a manager?), we expressed our disappointment and told him we were never greeted even after the 2 tables who sat down after us were assisted right away. He apologized but that was about it.   I'd like to give this place a second chance, but I feel like the lack of concern and customer service has already proven that it may not be worth it.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I went to Farm & Craft on Saturday 2/24/18. The place was busy (it was brunch time), and we had to wait about a half hour for a table; they have a text system that alerts you when your table is ready which was very nice because it allowed us to walk around and look in the stores in the surrounding area. I got a hipster-ish yet casual vibe from this place. There were tables outside and a comfortable amount of space between tables inside the restaurant.   Once we were seated, we were waited on by a very friendly and enthusiastic staff. The menu had plenty of options, all of which were highlighted by various health-oriented aspects. The options were extensive enough to provided unique dishes without being repetitive but not so widespread that it was overwhelming.   They had a wide range of beverages and cocktails that included house juiced concoctions, kombucha on tap, a typical range of bistro coffees, and an exceptional list of cocktails. I had originally intended to get kombucha, but my attention was diverted by a drink with my namesake (the Patrick); so, I tried that instead. The Patrick was a blend of pineapple juice, cantaloupe juice, lime juice, and jalapenos. Despite the jalapenos, the drink was not spicy, but the flavor was prevalent and nicely balanced the sweetness of the other juices.  For my entre, I order the salmon toast which was assembled with smoked salmon, tzatziki, watercress, and cherry tomato on top of flax whole wheat toast that I would guess was made in house; it was delicious and appropriately portioned so as not to fill me up but left me satisfied. All the flavors melded well; between the smokiness of the salmon and the subtle creamy, cool, tanginess of the tzatziki was applied in the perfect amount not to overpower the other flavors, the sweet cherry tomatoes had a wonderfully light taste to them that is often absent in supermarket tomatoes, and the flax seed toast added a wonderful grainy and savory flavor bringing the entire dish together. I also ordered their sweet potato hash which wasn't anything special, it consisted of diced sweet potatoes and caramelized onions, but still good.  My total bill was $14 not including tip, which I believe was a good value and reasonably priced for an ethically produced healthy meal. I would recommend going here.",

    "text": "This is really between 3 & 4 stars for me, but ultimately it's the food/menu that counts (which is the part I really liked), so I'll go on the higher side :)  For whatever reason I've avoided this place since it opened, but a friend wanted to go here for lunch recently so I said sure why not. It reminds me a lot of Flower Child menu-wise (which is another restaurant I didn't think I'd like until I ultimately tried it). There's a healthy mix of sandwiches/salads/wraps. They also do a thing where you can pick a protein (or tofu) and however many sides you want at $4 each. This is the option a went with (tofu + two sides).  As far as the restaurant itself it's nice. The dining room is big, and they have a bar (which I appreciate) as well as a nice patio. My one complaint is no matter where you sit it's LOUD.   My friend and I were confused when we walked in. We were waiting on someone else, but wanted to order a drink while we waited. At Farm & Craft you order food from a counter. The hostess told us if we were only drinking order from the bar, but if we were getting food...even if we were waiting to do so until our other friend arrived order at the counter. Don't really see the difference, but sure.   What made things even a little more confusing is that once our friend arrived (and the place got a little busier) a waitress came to our table as we were getting up to order at the counter (?).  That all being said, once you get past the whole confusing set-up/ordering process the food & drink are good!  For one, this place does Happy Hour (2-6). I forget what the beer is called they have on HH, but it's good and it's only $3. We also ordered the spinach dip, which was $5 during HH and it was delicious. It came w/carrots & healthy-ish crackers that were good.   Like I mentioned earlier I did the tofu + sides. The tofu was good, although I wish it would have been a little warmer. The bacon brussel sprouts were delicious and I LOVED the farro & cheese! It was rich, and cheesy and the farro was a very good substitute for pasta. The portions were not huge, but were definitely fair for the price.   I'd come back here during HH for sure.",

I ordered the salmon dish with sides of sweet potatoes and garlic spinach. I loved the varied unsweetened iced tea options and helped myself to one of the unique flavors before parking myself at a table next to an outlet to charge my phone.   Food is cooked to order so there was a short wait time, but totally worth it! My dish was incredible and probably my favorite thing I ate in Scottsdale all week. My only regret is that I didn't have an opportunity to return. Great spot for healthy people who love food.",

I wish I could have my house look like this place and I fact I took a few pictures for inspiration. It is clean, unique and modern which makes for a great atmosphere when out for brunch or lunch!   The food here is wonderful. I went with my girlfriends and we all tried something different and nothing disappointed. The portions were perfect size so we didn't leave food on our plate it needed a to go box. It was great flavors and didn't leave you feeling heavy or gross. The clean ingredients make for delicious eats!   The only thing holding me back from 5 stars was the very very very long wait for the food and lack of servers. Our server was wonderful but he was running around and didn't have time to fill up our waters or get us a second drink.    If you have time to kill and want good food stop in here! Also check out the juices - great for a kickstart in the morning ;)",

Thus why I probably hadn't been back for a few years despite living close :/ HOWEVER what I will say is we had delicious kombucha cocktails and the most phenomenal server which can make an experience too. The cocktails were refreshing and delicious. Our server also became aware that my friend broke up with her boyfriend yesterday and bought her a shot :) it's things like that you don't see anymore and always remember would go back for the service & drinks alone!",

There's outdoor seating, bar seating, and indoor table seating. We sat outside and it was very nice, although we did move once since we began to get pretty hot from the sun. The environment is casual and rustic. I love how the interior is decorated!   I enjoyed a couple of glasses of rose ($9 each) and I saw several people with unique drinks that were served in watermelon halves and oranges. When I return, I'll have to try one of these.   For food, we had the avocado hummus. Nice healthy option. The pita bread was warm and the hummus was unique! I followed that with the cashew chicken salad. It was huge and I had plenty left over to bring home. Overall, I really enjoyed the salad but I will say that I wish the dressing was a little more flavorful. That would be my only complaint. My mom has the quinoa Greek salad and she really liked it. The pieces of feta were huge and delicious!   The service was friendly and attentive. When I'm in the area, I'll definitely be back. I would love to check out their happy hour!",

The \"pita\" bread was the same as the \"flatbread\" bread-- which tasted like frozen pizza crust. The bbq on the flatbread was more like a sweetened ketchup. For the hummus- tasted like there was some rotten avocado in the hummus. If you've ever eaten a bad avo, you know what I'm talking. Besides the \"pita\" bread, came with carrots and broccoli- both not fresh. Found a bug in my broccoli.   For drinks, ordered the 805 and kombucha. Fortunately you can't mess that up so we liked our drinks.   Service- sub par. I've been in the service industry for over a decade...please sir, don't treat me like scum because I ordered off the happy hour. I know how to leave a good tip so long as you treat me well.

I have celiacs and always have such a hard time finding gluten free options that taste good. Farm & Craft does not disappoint! I ordered the Wild Mushroom flatbread and I can honestly say I have never had a flatbread/pizza this amazing! In addition to the fact that it was Gluten free (with no upcharge!), the toppings were imppecable!  Everything was perfectly distributed with tons of mushrooms. Super flavorful without being overpowering. The service was great! (full water glass at all times which is something I truly appreciate). I will absolutely be returning and would 11/10 recommend, especially if you are gluten free! Well done Farm & Craft!",

There was a bar inside and a beautiful patio outside. We opted to sit inside because it was a bit chilly outside. Within a very short time our food arrived. I had never ordered oatmeal when dining out, however, I wanted to stay within my diet and from the description: blueberry, apple and chia seeds, topped with golden milk; it sounded amazing. It was. It came in a small bowl and was just the right amount, and very filling. It was creamy and perfectly sweetened. There was turmeric mixed in to reduce inflammation - perfect during weightlifting and had apple squares on top.  Strawberries blueberries and almond milk smoothie is what I had for my drink along with a nice cup of coffee. The smoothie was refreshing and naturally sweet. I added in peptides for extra nutrients.   As a starter we got the avocado hummus which consisted of avocado, citrus vinaigrette, spices, served with a pita & broccoli and carrots.   The overall experience was a wonderful way to spend my birthday brunch! I think next time we will sit out on the patio. Hopefully it will be warmer!   They also have vegan ice cream which is rare to find. I ran out of room but next time I'll start with that first!",

    "text": "Just don't.  I would give this 1 and a half stars if they allowed because the service was acceptable but simply put, the food was barely palatable.  Farm & Craft bills itself as 'focused on healthy and sustainable food'. I'm sure the food is both healthy and sustainable but so are grass clippings.  It doesn't mean you want to eat them.   The restaurant is part of a trend that focuses more on dietary needs than flavor, texture or appearance.  You end up with bland food that only those with extreme dietary requirements would find acceptable.  If you read five star reviews, that's their target audience.  My wife is the person F&C was designed to serve. She is gluten free, does not eat fried food and her animal proteins are limited to the ocean.  She basically lives on veggies and loves them .  She ordered the Chilled Raw Pad Thai after the waiter indicated that it was one of his favorite menu items.    She was served a plate of raw spiralized zuchini with equal parts julienned carots and some bean sprouts.  She had it topped with some grilled tofu.  We both agreed that the Pad Thai flavor was sorely missing and that the only part of the dish with some value was the grilled tofu.  She compared the dish to one of those bagged salads you can buy at the supermarket.  She finished her dish because with her diet, she's learned to tolerate just about anything but she wouldn't return to F&C.   I ordered the Steak Wrap with a side salad.  First, what would you expect to be the primary ingredient in a steak wrap?  Steak, of course.  Unfortunately, F&C believes that adding a bunch of soggy baby bella mushrooms is an acceptable substitute for a reasonably amount of steak.  Hint, they're not!  The entire soggy mess was served in a whole grain tortilla that should have been first crisped a bit on a grill.  The pepper jack cheese had no flavor and there wasn't even a hint of the horseradish sauce.  If I have to add Sriracha to a wrap that has horseradish sauce,  we have a problem.  The sad thing was that the wrap wasn't the worst thing on the plate.  The 'side salad' was literally a few lettuce greens on the side of the plate that had been tossed with some utterly nondescript vinaigrette.  The entire dish was tasteless and boring.  Even the steak was boring as it hadn't been seasoned at all.  The bottom line is that regardless of dietary goals and mission statements, the first job of a restaurant is to serve food that tastes good.  It was completely possible to make both dishes we were served excellent.  Seasoning is not an enemy of the environment nor the digestive tract.  There has to be steak in a steak wrap. Pad Thai, regardless of the angle, should have some peanut flavor.  And a salad is more than some lettuce leaf.",

    "text": "Strolling around Old Town Scottsdale with my family, I spotted an adorable restaurant called Farm & Craft the first day of the visit. I said: \"That looks so cute, let's go there on Sunday for brunch.\"  And so we Open-Tabled it up, and we got our brunch on. We sat on the patio with our dog, and the restaurant was super dog friendly. They even had a basket of toys and water bowls for dogs, and there was an entree you could order for your dog on the menu, which was neat.   I really liked the thoughtful healthy options on this menu. It was clearly identified for different dietary needs such as common ones like gluten-free and vegan. Farm & Craft takes this up a notch by offering unique designations like anti-inflammatory diet and reduce overall stress for their menu.   I enjoyed the mimosa and crustless quiche that I ordered. One of us had an \"amazing\" fresh bowl with salmon. I got a side of beets, and they were so good with a horseradish sauce. Another one of us had a \"underwhelming\" burrito.   We all agree our waitress was not super friendly and seemed like we annoyed her when we asked questions, but we know everyone has a bad day now and then. Overall, Farm & Craft was lovely, and we will definitely be back.",

    "text": "This is a very hip place located in downtown Scottsdale with a focus on fresh and local. I enjoyed the variety of items on the menu, including multiple vegan items that were clearly labeled.   Their cocktail menu is particularly unique with a variety of kombucha-based cocktails. Of particular enjoyment, though, was the incredibly fresh Paloma. They take a fresh grapefruit and hollow it out to make juice, then they mix the tequila with the juice, pour it back into the grapefruit, and serve it in the fruit with a straw! The presentation alone is worth it.  I had the probiotic bowl, which honestly sounded better than it tasted. It was served with mixed greens because of the romaine scare, and that might have been part of the problem, as the bitterness of the greens didn't work well with the dish. It was also not that filling - after 2 hours I was quite hungry again.  My husband did the vegan flatbread, which was the better option of the two. It was topped heavily with arugula, making for a nice presentation.  Our service was excellent. The server was kind, helpful, and patient. I wish I had gotten her name because she was the type that deserves a shout out by name.  All in all, I would return to try a few more items on the menu, especially the drink menu. They seem to have a good happy hour, so that might be the prime time to go.",

The food, drinks, and service were all worthy of a five star review!   We started with the Avocado Hummus Appetizer (check out the Yelp check-in offer).  The veggies were fresh and the hummus was quite tasty!   For our meal, we ordered the Rustic Salmon Farm Bowl, the Flat-Iron Steak, and a side of Brussels sprouts (with bacon, walnuts, and cranberries).  The quinoa, salmon, and vegetables in the salmon bowl all complemented each other wonderfully!  The Brussels sprouts are recommended as well.  And the star of the night was the Flat-Iron Steak!  The included side is mashed potatoes, but they had run out of mashed potatoes, so we substituted a side of sweet potato hash... and the resulting combination of flavors was absolute perfection!  Loved this dish!  The only drink we ordered was The Hydrator.  I thought it was vibrant, refreshing, and interesting (in a good way)!  I don't recall the name of our server, but he had a handful of tables and was still very personable, quick to take our drink, appetizer, and meal orders, answer menu questions, and follow up with us!     *****FIVE STARS*****",

I am rarely critical of a restaurant, as I want to see Scottsdale's restaurants succeed. But, it seems like there are misguided greedy people in the business.  This place epitomizes the reputation Scottsdale has for being pretentious.   For now, I don't trust the team at F&C and won't eat there.

    "text": "I came here on a Sunday night with a friend last month.  The restaurant was about a third full. The restaurant decor fit the name of the restaurant perfectly.  We were greeted and seated very quickly.  The service was great until we paid the bill.  My friend just came back from hiking and was drinking lots of water.  The water glass went empty for about 10-15 minutes before it got refilled.  The biggest problem was the food.  Started off with the hummus.  I've never had hummus that ran thru the tines of the fork.  It was the consistency of a soup.  The flavor was even worst.  It had no flavor.  It tasted like mashed chickpeas mixed with water.  There was no tahini  flavor at all.  The pita bread that came with it tasted old.  They could have heated it up to freshen it up.  I had the Strawberry and Goat Cheese Salad.  It was a little small as other people stated, but I had a big lunch so it was the perfect size for me.  The problem was there was only two strawberries the size of grapes.  To make up for it I think they gave me LOTS of goat cheese.  I like goat cheese but it's really strong and you need to balance it with the rest of the ingredients.  My friend had the chicken and sweet potato hash  She liked the hash a lot, but the chicken was only okay. She recommended this restaurant and was kind of sorry we came here.  I only gave it two stars because it's all about the food.  The service and atmosphere are fine.  Maybe it was off night.  Even our company cafeteria makes better food considering the number of complaints they receive.",

I ordered a coffee, which had really great flavor and their protein pancakes. I would not have guessed those pancakes were protein if I had not know. They had berries inside the cake and were topped with granola and pieces of strawberries. They are 2 medium sized cakes and not much of the agave is needed as the granola and berries add so much flavor. My friend is vegan and ordered the vegan Tofu sandwich. The server said the portion was a good size for one person but she was only able to eat half. Her sandwich also came with a side salad.   I definitely recommend making reservations if going for brunch and don't waste time circling looking for street parking. Just go to the parking garage located on 5th ave.",

I just happen to make my first visit on Thursday night. Thursday they have flatbread and a bottle of wine for $20.  I would of loved to have ordered it if I didn't commit to not drinking while on trek to clean eating.  Walking in it was pretty busy with no open tables besides the bar or patio. Luckily they have heaters from top to bottom on the patio which is perfect for me.   Service was a little slow to start off and I could hear the waiter Tell the tables in front and behind me apologizing for the wait and that the kitchen was backed up. So I kinda gave the waiter some slack and maybe it was the $20 Thursday rush.   Right after he let the other tables know about the food he finally noticed our table. We ordered Kombutcha with Rum and Kombutcha with Bourbon. Definitely recommend the Kombutcha with Bourbon it was delicious!  For my main dish I ordered chicken Farro Mac & Cheese which was pretty good. But sadly my chicken was so dry it was tough to chew and I couldn't even cut threw it.  I feared sending it back to the kitchen having to wait another 30 mins.  One dish I really enjoyed and could eat over and over again was the avocado hummus! It was the appetizer and I should of just ordered that for dinner that would of satisfied my palette.   For dessert I ordered the Paleo brownies with a scoop of ice cream. It was the perfect ending to dinner, but beware it's not your usual brownie! So if your in for a sweet treat this may not be your choice, but I loved it.   Maybe next time service will be better and my chicken will not be so dry.",

We are seated by the hostess and served. The free check in offer of hummus with veggies and flatbread is a must have! Delicious! I order the veggie bowl and he gets the American breakfast. It comes out very quickly. Large portions and really good. If I didn't have so many plans today I'd have tried one of their \"healthy\" drinks as that menu looked so good! Overall everything I like, if I lived around here I'd be a regular! I recommend this place! Trendy, delicious and healthy!  9/9/19: This place needs to open a location in Las Vegas asap! The food is AMAZING. I came back for lunch the day after I had breakfast here during my vacation stay in Phoenix. This time I had the salmon poke bowl and the carrot cleanse juice. Both were so good, I finished my bowl up to the last quinoa grain. It looks and tastes exquisite. The juice was a perfect mix of carrot and citrus, no overly dominant flavors. This time I sat outside and it was very relaxing. Soft pillows on the couches, music and sprinklers keeping you cool. Unfortunately I am going back home, if only I could take this place with me! I want to try every single item of the menu!",

We came here with a bachelorette group of 15, and me being the bride to be had to apologize to my group several times for this restaurants lack of hospitality, service and slowness. We reserved months ahead, only to find out our table was not ready. After switching tables from inside to outside, we started ordering drinks which arrived 0.48 minutes later followed by apps after 1 hour followed by our entrees probably close to another hour. At least give the bride to be her drink....?   Anyways, the level of service we received from this place was just pathetic. We watched several nearby tables who arrived after us and received their meal and drinks right away which made us question a lot of things.  Bottom line, do not come here with a large group, they will not be able to accommodate you and you will have a poor overall experience which will ruin your day.   Advice to owner: Don't take reservations for large groups if you can't accommodate them in a timely manner.   Lastly, we had an amazing experience at each and every restaurant we went as a large group; except for this one.",

What was the point of making reservations for big group , right ? We let it slide .   We sat outside , all 15 girls  and I could see we did not blend in as a Minority  and \" women of color\" and from that point on , everything went downhill . Our waitress didn't seem  too pleased to serve us and seem so bothered by us , it took hour to get our drinks ( I understand it was a big group ) so we all decided to to be patient and just chitchat until the drinks were served . Let's talk about horrible customer service and how the food got served and how some of us never received the things we ask for such as spoon and silverware. Two hour  brunch turned into five hour disaster because it took them hour to serve drinks , other hour to serve our food and end of the day horrible CUSTOMER SERVICE . I would never go back to this place nor I recommend any other person of color to this restaurant because this place seems to serve well only to Caucasians .   Stay tuned for more reviews coming from 14 bridesmaids , who felt the same way .",

The waiter was friendly and patient with us as we studied the menu. My boyfriend and I both chose to get a salad. I got the Strawberry and Goat salad. It was great... not overly saturated with dressing and had plenty of yummy, fresh strawberries. My boyfriend loved his salad as well! The avocado hummus came to us free with a Check-In here on Yelp. It, too, was delicious and I would highly recommend you order this (with or without the Check-In offer... it's worth it!) as an appetizer. When I am back in town this will definitely be on my list of places to revisit!",

The grilled salmon with pea puree, quinoa, and zucchini spirals was so flavorful that I forgot how zen it was advertised to be! The hydrator cocktail tastes like an Anthropologie store smells, but I still enjoyed both it - twice. Definitely recommend this place. Don't be scared off by the Whole Foods natural deodorant vibes - it puts just as much emphasis on taste as it does on health-centric living & community!!",

We came on a Thursday morning most recently and found the staff to be very welcoming to us and the food we ordered came out quickly. We ate on the patio (a sunny 118 degrees) as we had our pup daisy with us! However, it was very comfortable with the mister fans on and they had plenty of shade with the parasol umbrellas overhead. In my opinion, the design outside is very tropical and the overall vibe is hipster. We ordered the breaky burrito which was tasty with the avocado, eggs, and cheese. My husband ordered a bowl with tofu and tabbouleh with a side of bacon and we shared a pancake. The tofu was so-so but not terrible. Just a bit on the bland and dry side. He ended up stealing the tomatillo sauce from my burrito. That sauce was delicious so the taste was much better. The protein pancake was really tasty and had a good fluff to it. According to daisy, the star of the show was the bacon. She found it delicious and really enjoyed her two slices. In addition, the water bowl and toys on the patio are a super nice touch for the dogs. We will definitely be back as overall we really like this place! Healthier options which we really enjoy. Solid place. We didn't try any of the drinks so can't comment on that.",

These guys bend over backwards to make sure they're providing dishes that accommodate as many of those dietary restrictions as possible.    My wife and I started off with the avocado hummus as an appetizer which included some of the best gluten free flatbread I can ever remember having.  Certainly didn't disappoint.  Once the entrees came (bbq chicken flatbread and strawberry goat cheese salad), I was surprised by how much food we got for the price.  I added the grass-fed steak to my salad, which was perfectly cooked.  Just the right amount of vinaigrette, fresh strawberries, and greens that seemed like they were picked moments before they were plated.    Definitely headed back.",

I got the salmon bowl which had blackened salmon over quinoa with a ton of veggies and the perfect amount of pesto sauce. It was truly amazing and you still feel healthy but satisfied after eating it.   We didn't get cocktails but wanted them. The table next to us got some that came out in a small watermelon and in a grapefruit. They also had fresh juices and smoothies. You can order from the front too if you don't want to stay and sit. The atmosphere was really cool and the service was nice. They have outdoor and indoor seating.",

    "text": "I popped in here for a healthy lunch while visiting Scottsdale for a girls weekend. After a few too many glasses of wine too many nights in a row, we desperately needed to lay off the cheese and crackers and put something nutritious into our bodies.... we decided on Farm & Craft. We went on a Monday right before lunch time. I'm not sure if we just got lucky and missed the lunch rush, but we nearly had the place to ourselves.   The only way I can think to describe the atmosphere and decor is \"Instagram cute\". Don't get me wrong, the place was ADORABLE and I loved it, but every turn felt like another instagram photo op... but seriously I'm not complaining.   Anyway, on to the most important part... the FOOD! Being my indecisive self I stared at the menu for far too long. Did I want an acai bowl, protein toast, a build your own bowl??? Eventually, I just asked the hostess her favorite dish and got ordered that without the blink of an eye - the Rustic Salmon Bowl. O.M.G, am I glad I did. When I ordered, I truly thought it was going to be one of those healthy meals that tastes like you're eating cardboard, but I ended up basically licking my plate it was so good.  The fresh juices are also really tasty, too. I whimsically ordered the essential kale juice, and am almost about to start tying to juice at home so I can make recreate this drink. All in all - this place was a TOTAL hit. I'd come back here any day - not just when I'm 'trying to be healthy'.",

    "text": "So here's the thing: my coworkers and I came during the lunch rush, we were a pretty sizable party, and this place is just getting off of the ground--all things I kept reminding myself during our experience here. That being said, places don't really hang around for long in this area if they can't figure out how to do lunch quickly and well.  Being immediately greeted by the ordering counter upon walking in is a little overwhelming. I felt pressured to make a decision immediately, as the line can hold probably 8 people before it's right out the door and into the scorching heat. The \"build your own\" section was a bit confusing to me, as there was no elaboration as to how many things you choose for a plate. However, a staff member was over fairly quickly to explain how everything worked, and even to give a couple recommendations, which I always appreciate. Seeing as they had just opened, they weren't offering their full menu yet--completely understandable, but guests should be made more aware of that upon entry/being greeted rather than being told at the register.   The food is stellar, that much can't be denied. I built my own meal, choosing the roasted broccolini ($3), farro mac and cheese ($3), and grass-fed steak ($5). The steak was cooked to medium-rare perfection, though they never asked how I wanted it done, so this might be a problem for others who like theirs well-done. The farro mac and cheese surpassed all of my expectations, with some of the best cheese sauce I've had in recent memory. However, the name can be somewhat misleading, as farro serves as the \"mac\" in this dish. The broccolini was topped with red pepper and Parmesan and also surpassed my expectations. My only issue with the food here was the quantity. I'm a small person, it definitely doesn't take much to fill me up, but even I was left looking for something more to munch on after my meal. It's hard not to be slightly irritated to pay $3 for approximately 2.5 stalks of broccolini, regardless of how tasty it is.   As I mentioned, we had a big group dining here and it's a fast casual place, so we had pretty realistic expectations that we wouldn't all be served our food at the exact same time. But there's a bit of an issue when the first person doesn't receive their meal until probably 40 minutes after sitting down, and the last half dozen are so fed up with waiting over an hour after that, that they request their food to just be boxed up so they could take it back to the office and eat. The manager did come out and apologize, promising refunds for those few which was appreciated. Pro tip: you can't market yourself as a fast casual restaurant if you're not fast.  The other big issue we faced was with the service. Again, I tried to keep in mind that they were a brand new restaurant and everyone was still trying to figure things out. But it's hard for a girl to remain understanding when the misters on the patio are essentially a monsoon storm in and of themselves. We were sitting on the patio, having moved a few tables together to fit all of us in, and there were probably 6-7 misters pointing at only our table. We noticed right when we sat down that they seemed to be on pretty strong, but underestimated how soaked everything would get. We asked an employee after a few minutes of it would be possible to turn them down, and he agreed to speak to someone about it. Upon his return, he said that due to a \"technical error,\" there was nothing he could do about them. So in response, we explained that since we were the only table these were affecting, would it be possible to just have them shut off? I felt bad for the guy, really I did, but the look of exasperation on his face seemed unnecessary before he muttered a vague apology, repeated the technical error line, and said he'd see what he could do. I mean, all of our hair was drenched and matted to our faces, it was soaking the dishes that had arrived by then, and there were literal puddles of water on the tables. He returned and repeated the same line. A coworker went to speak to someone else about it, and had the misters shut off maybe 10 minutes later.   I love the farm to table concept, and the environment and brand that they've built is really great at capturing that idea. But it strikes me as odd that they'd choose to open right next to the Original ChopShop, which is an already well-established brand successfully executing the same general idea. For the quality of the food alone, I hope this place can quickly work out its kinks, but I'm not gonna hold my breath on that one. Until I hear someone I trust tell me that they had the best dining experience of their entire lives here, I likely won't be back.",

Server was nice but didn't acknowledge the table when my grind got there for like 15 mins when he talked to the table next to us 3 times. And didn't get the whole spiel like the other table did about what the icons meant but I figured it out myself. For my brunch entrees I got the protein porridge and pancakes unfortunately I couldn't purchase one pancake al carte and had to spend $10 just to eat one pancake and waste the other 2. And the don't do sugar free vanilla lattes only regular ones packed with sugar. My friend wanted the brioche almond butter banana but they ran out of brioche. So she had to order something else she really didnt want after driving all the way from alvondale to try the place out. She also ordered a glass of rose as asked for raspberries but they don't carry raspberries and she said that was fine no fruit because she's allergic to strawberries and she was brought a glass of rose with the one fruit she was allergic to... Strawberries. Very unimpressed porridge isn't really a porridge more like quinoa and fruit didn't eat it. Ate pancakes since porridge wasn't good, they were pretty decent. I might try lunch or an acai bowl, but brunch... Meh.  Update: Went to try a acai bowl, stood there for 10 mins because no one knew how to ring it up. Took 30 mins to get it because the crew that knew how to make it wasn't there, was made wrong the first time so it had to be remade and again forgot to put the strawberries on it. Was offered to have another one made after calling to tell them it was wrong but I had to go back to work. I was already there for 40 mins. Not satisfactions, probably won't be back.",

I did not care for the wheat dough what so ever. There is an obvious lack of toppings and the bread overwhelms each bite. I don't even think they were True wild mushrooms on the pizza as it was advertised, more like generic button mushrooms I could easily get from sprouts. Not worth the money plain and simple.

Think Flower Child but with alcohol and louder music. I came here for dinner with some girlfriends after a movie, nice end to a summer weekend.   I was hungry and ordered the chicken pesto flatbread and split the farro mac and cheese with a friend. The mac and cheese is sooo flavorful!!! It was really delish!! My chicken pesto flatbread was just okay -- good cheese, good chicken and fresh pesto, but I didn't care for thier whole wheat flatbread dough.  I know I know I know --- health food isn't always good, but it should be pretty tasty when I'm dining out. The dough really lacked flavor and I ended up just eating the chicken and pesto and mozz off of it instead.   I ordered the Kombucha and cucumber cocktail with vodka. Be warned, you could easily drink these without realizing there is any alcohol. They are light and refreshing and be potentially dangerous if you drink it too quickly. Hopefully you don't have too many, as they're $12/cocktail.  I also ordered the Rose all Day special, a $9 glass of rose wine that I really enjoyed. Apparently Sunday brunch its half off at $4.50/glass which is a real steal in my opinion. I'll def return to try that, as well as sample the brunch menu.  I want to try this place again to see if other menu items are worth my time, especially brunch.  The menu seems sort of limited, and I was disappointed in some of the bland flavors. The veggies are very fresh and the juices are wholesome.  I'm just not sure if it grades well with all of the other great options in the area. I'll keep you posted ;)",

    "text": "Strange experience. Some other customers were given a full menu when seated, though we were given a smaller \"brunch menu\" with only 2 sandwiches and a couple salads on it, everything else was breakfast food - even though it was 4pm. We asked for the other menu and was told that's not the menu for today... even though they have that menu on the board when you walk in - which you can order from for take out... I'm not sure why we couldn't order that food when eating at the Farm & Craft.  The staff was rushed and disorganized. We ordered more pita for our hummus and it arrived after our mains, even though the hummus was an appetizer... The food was tasty but not out of this world. Overall, not a great experience. I'd rather go to ChopShop next door for similar food, better service and a more enjoyable experience.",

My friend gets me and her a drink from the bartender who was female. Our friends show up and sit up at the bar with us. After a solid 10 mins of not even a acknowledgement of my friends with even a napkin let alone water I ask a waitress to get the bartenders attention. I see she does and I wait. It's now been over 20 mins of her chatting with her friends and taking care of their drinks. It has now been over 30 mins of nothing. I finally asked for the manager who was kind and took care of us. He was wonderful. As for the bartender, she needs to find a new job!!!",

    "text": "I had high hopes and expectations when we arrived for dinner. Inside and outside dining was about half full and so was the bar. Clearly a millennial hangout, which didn't bother me as I had my 2 millennial daughters with me. As we were seated, it was announced Jake would be our waiter. After a bit, he got our drink order but more like he announced he'd get us waters. 10 minutes later, a young lady brought our water with Jake in tow. He took out order. I ordered chicken and dubbed out the cauliflower mash for sweet potato hash, daughter 1 orders chicken sausage penne and 2nd daughter orders chicken tacos and a side of sweet potato hash.  20 minutes later, Jake saunters by asking if we'd like salt or hot sauce?  Salt, Jake. He brings it by and then 10 minutes later our food arrives. A 30 minute wait time? Here's where the wheels really fall off the wagon. The chicken is vile. Vulgar. Disgusting. Imagine biting into a pill of amoxicillin and Benadryl. At that point, my pallet is blown out and I am done eating. Before I eat the chicken, I taste the pasta. It's undente. As in not cooked. The sweet potato hash is made up of various sizes and doneness.  Some cooked. Some raw.  Jake finally wanders by after continually flirting and playing with his girlfriend at the bar. I had a clear shot of the show my entire visit. I inform him how disgusting the chicken was. The \"manager?\" comes over and offers to replace. Nope, I'm done. He brings the check and has removed my dinner and sweet potato hash. It takes another 10 minutes for someone to come get my payment. Suffice to say, I will not be returning nor recommending Farm and Craft. Ever....",

I really liked the atmosphere, the service, the patio but most importantly the healthy yet delicious menu options. I had the Rustic Farm Salmon but and it was delicious, fresh and flavorful! I went during brunch hours, they did have happy hour drinks but they weren't much of happy hour prices I am use to but they were tasty. I recommend trying them out when you are in the old town Scottsdale area.",

Not bad but it took awhile to actually make the drink as the bartenders are not Craft cocktail experts and don't seem too worried about speed. Once I got it, the cocktail was great.   Was sat about fifteen minutes later and it took 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us for water and more cocktails.   Had the spinach and artichoke dip to start and the roasted chicken for my main course.   I feel like this is where the tale of two dinners starts. Tale 1: the food was good and flavorful for being a healthy option. Tale 2: When you have a ton of early 20 hipsters waiting on you, you get slow crappy service and they seem to not care. I would have made a concession if they were super busy but they weren't.   I really like F&C and hope the service improves. We dropped 100 on drinks and dinner with tip. Scottsdale has too many good places in that price range so service needs to be top notch.",

Specifically: Long wait for food after ordering, once food arrived, the toast was missing. Toast did not arrive until I after finished eating. Side order of sausage was also forgotten, it too did not arrive until both of us were finished. Also food server never came by for coffee refills. As stated though the food was good and we will give it another try as it may have just been an off day.  2/11/18 -- My wife and I decided to give Farm and Craft another try, in part because of the nice response from Kevin. It is unfair to fully evaluate a restaurant based on one experience. And I will say that on this visit the negative issues did not reoccur. The food was, as before, very good and the simultaneous arrival of all items ordered was appreciated. The menu, very much health oriented, will find a large appreciative audience here in Scottsdale. It was a bit cool for the large patio, but the openness of the large doors gives the restaurant a very airy feeling. I would encourage others to give the restaurant a try.  DDL",

I ordered the Cali Bowl {quinoa | kale | cherry heirloom tomato | edamame | asparagus | yellow endive | pepper jack cheese | avocado}. Presentation was on point and it was almost too pretty to eat! The tomato added a great acidic boost to the dish. I liked it so much I recreated it at home (results may vary). I also got one of their fresh pressed juices- which honestly next time I'll skip. It was pretty expensive at $7. And I just can't justify spending $7 on a drink that doesn't have any alcohol lol! Which brings me to my next point, their bar set up is really cute and I wish I would've sat there so I could see what type of selection they offered. I will make it a point to come back here for some Bloody Mary's and brunch!",

The smoothie was pretty good, but that protein toast was crazy delicious. I had my friends try it and they loved it too. I had a piece of the salmon toast as well, and I might order that next time! The woman who took my order was extremely pleasant and friendly. If I lived in this area, I would definitely be a regular.",

I had a memorable drink called Kombucha Cucumber (recommended by a great bartender!) and the drink hit all the right notes for me. The kale salad, fresh salmon and farro all made me go back for a second helping. Andrew, the general manager, was on the spot with advice and recommendations, and the staff in general were great. There were a couple of times when folks intruded upon what was a private party, and the interlopers were instantly and courteously spoken to. It was handled quickly and professionally. While I can only speak to how they handled a corporate event rather than the regular dining experience, I was very pleased overall. We have many folks with restrictions, and this place was very accomodating and of great quality. Thanks for a great night, good job team!",

We started with avocado hummus. It was very good and came served with piping hot pita bread and veggies. I had the Strawberry Goat salad (which came very underdressed but tasty after tracking down the server for extra dressing) and BBQ flatbread pizza. Not used to this pizza being prepared with regular pizza sauce instead of BBQ sauce so was disappointed-my bad for not noticing this on the menu. The others at the table ordered the grilled salmon and the veggie tacos. While they enjoyed their meal, the salmon was a little bland and the veggie tacos would be much better served with beans as added protein choice. All in all the food was ok but it was the service that ruined the experience for us. I mean, who just walks by with a quick tap on the table and \"are you guys doing ok here?\"",

Unfortunately, the music was so loud we couldn't hear each other and eventually got tired of trying to eat and yell at each other. The waitress got our order wrong probably because she couldn't hear us. The music was nice, reminded me of the dance club I went to the night before. The steak sandwich was excellent despite the burnt toast. She liked her chicken salad but the pita bread it came with was also burned.   The decor was nice and modern, which is part of the problem as beautiful as it is it amplifies sounds. I was thinking maybe I would try sitting outside next time but as I was leaving we noticed that the music was overwhelming there too.   I called to ask for a manager the next day. Apparently, all managers were in a meeting and was told they would call me back. So 2 more days later without a return call I called this time getting a manager. I didn't get an apology for no one returning my call or for the poor experience. If you want to eat in an atmosphere where management doesn't care that your head is pounding from the noise, straining your throat yelling at the people you're with and staff seem more interested in having a good time than providing good service then enjoy.",

    "text": "We visited Farm & Craft last night for dinner. The restaurant is in Old Town Scottsdale and we arrived around 7:15. There was a good crowd but it wasn't at capacity. The restaurant is designed very well. The decor was in a farm house modern design. The music was quite loud, had to strain to hear my dinner companions. There aren't any soft elements to the restaurant so the music seems quite loud. The staff is dressed casually, sneakers, tank tops (not my favorite) and it seemed all the men had long beards and tattoos. We ordered the chicken salad, a flat bread, and a kale caesar salad. The food is billed as organic, gluten free, good for digestion, etc. They offer a variety of craft cocktails with trendy ingredients, such as Kombucha. The plates, bowls, etc. are plastic. Jury is still out on whether I like this or not.  The flat bread was average, at best. I had the chicken salad. It was deconstructed. The flavors weren't memorable, rather bland. The best part was the pita bread made with flax seeds if I'm not mistake.  The service was comparable to a low end chain restaurant. Our waitress was competent but not memorable. Midway through the meal I needed another glass of wine, it look at least five minutes for our waitress to come by. I had to prompt her for another glass. It took another 5 minutes plus to receive the wine. I watched her check on another table, run a bill, chat with the bartender who wasn't doing anything, go to another table, go back to the bar, chat with the bartender, then my wine came out as I was finishing my meal. The waitress cleared half the table's plates, dropped my check directly under my hand as I was bringing up my fork to my mouth. Classy move. The service wasn't terrible but wasn't polished at all.   The overall experience was mediocre. If you're in the mood for a trendy, buzz word filled, bland menu accompanied by average service, I would recommend Farm & Craft.",

We decided on the chicken sausage scramble and the protein pancakes. The chicken sausage scramble tasted fresh and healthy, and I loved that they had sweet potato in it too! If you want more spice, I recommend adding cholula hot sauce -- it was soo good. The protein pancakes had blueberries in the middle and were drizzled with strawberries and granola. They were a little dry but amazing with the syrup. The pancakes themselves were very filling and we couldn't finish them.  My one thing was that their tap kombucha wasn't that great that day.  I'm not too familiar with kombucha, but my friend has had several types and didn't like theirs. Hopefully that was just us!",

UPDATE: on 10/23 I was contacted by management suggesting I ask for the tofu seasoned and marinated next time and offering a free meal. They stopped replying to me and never followed through with the meal. I went in again with my manager for a work event and tried to ask for the tofu the way it was suggested. The girl at the counter insisted it could not be done and it had to be served plain. I had to ask her 3 times to go ask the kitchen staff and what do you know??? It can be done. The tofu tasted a little better seasoned but I am not impressed with the lack of customer service here. There are much better places to eat in Old Town that won't give you a hard time if you want to customize your meal.",

We also got to take some cute pictures with the walls (they're so fun!) I'd love to come back and try their brunch.  The only reason why I'm giving a 4 instead of a 5 is because it is a little pricy. My friend paid $14 for two small tacos, and I paid around 12 for my bowl which could've been a little more full.

He wasn't necessarily mean, but he definitely could've gave much better service. He didn't even mention any favorites, specials or even desserts on the menu. I asked if they had coffee and I had specifically asked for something sweet (I do not like bitter or hard, dark tastes), he told us the coffee would be sweet. He brings out our coffee. Not at ALL sweet. By our table was a bus boy I'm not sure, but asked if he could possibly bring sugar or creamer, he gave us so many options and more. He brought us a whole little tray and he was the sweetest!   Overall, the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant was relaxing and the food was very good. I would've gave a 5 star if our server would have been nicer and offered more options, and give that bus boy a raise!",

I especially love the herringbone floor and all the cute little accents. Their menu is simple, and I highly recommend one of their fresh juice cocktails served inside a watermelon or grapefruit.  I had the protein pancakes which had blueberries baked inside, and was topped with strawberries and local granola. It came with a coconut agave syrup which I really enjoyed. I loved the crunch of granola. Usually I get bored with pancakes but these were great and balance just the right amount of sweetness, and it wasn't too candy-like. I left feeling really good, not full and exhausted. I think that's what Farm and Craft does well, serve food that makes you feel good.",

It's a great place to grab a nice healthy breakfast, lunch or brunch. We ordered their Vegan ceviche which was combination of yellow beets, avocado and radish. It came with crackers. I think it's a little too pricey for what it is, but tasty non the less. I tried the Matcha-Mule drink (non-alcoholic). It was refreshing, but not my favorite, I would not order again. The juice tastes like a combination of green juice with straight ginger  beer soda and the flavors did not compliment each other as well as I would have liked.  Overall I think the atmosphere makes up for any falls and I am definetly planning on coming back for some lunch items.",

We waited for 10 minutes (I timed it) before our server greeted us. Waters came, but coffee took a while after that. My husband asked if he could order a single pancake on the side of his breakfast and I reiterated \"Just a single, right? Not a whole order, just a single pancake?\" and our server nodded like she understood. Our food took over 20 minutes and when it arrived: you guessed it. Full order of pancakes. My protein toast was delicious, but cold and had clearly been sitting there for a while.  Our server didn't check in on us until we were done, but luckily it wasn't a huge deal to take the full order of pancakes off and get charged for only a single. We paid in cash and it took about 15 minutes to get change.   All in all, I'm not trying to take over an hour for breakfast even if things go 100% right. Our server seemed overwhelmed, but I also don't get why other servers couldn't help out and offer to get us water or coffee refills when they were walking by, clearly seeing us.  Like I said, we've been about 4 other times and service is always hugely lacking. We keep going back because the food and atmosphere is great, but I think we've had our last visit.",

Being from out of town, I had not heard the latest buzz about this place, rather my husband was looking for a healthy option for me and stumbled upon it on yelp.  This place could not have been any more perfect. I recently started the Autoimmune protocol diet (AIP) which is similar to Paleo, but stricter. Needless to say, it is a huge pain to eat out on this diet. My jaw dropped when I walked in and saw the menu actually had dishes labeled with AIP friendly next to it.  I ordered a fresh juice, sweet potato hash, and bacon. It was just enough to fill me and all of it was part of my special diet. My husband typically isn't a huge fan of \"healthy food\" but really enjoyed the protein pancakes. We also took advantage of the yelp special and ordered the avocado hummus appetizer which was fresh and tasty.  Minus 1 star for the service. It was 115 degrees outside and was nearly impossible to find our server to refill our waters. The service was slow and he did not come by our table to see how things were going.",

This was a nice, light, and healthy feeling break after a long weekend of the opposite.  I got the breakfast burrito and sweet potato hash. There burrito didn't match what you'll often find in New Mexico and I didn't expect it to. It felt a bit like a breakfast wrap with the type of bread. The farm-to-table type ingredients inside also made the burrito much less heavy, which I appreciated.   The sweet potato hash was a big winner. It wasn't cheap as a side dish but it was the right size and the flavor made it more than worthwhile. I'd get that again in a heartbeat.  Farm & Craft has some hot sauces available at one of the nearby counters while you're eating. They're quite good so grab one and give it a try.",

The atmosphere however is probably what I liked most about Farm & Craft. With its \"instagrammable\" walls as my friend would say, and it's adorable patio, the vibe in this hip restaurant is nothing short of welcoming. Did I mention the staff were all delightful as well?

The protein portion that came with both bowls was just SO SMALL. Honestly...the bowls should really be renamed to something like \"quinoa/farro bowls with a side of meat\" because that would be less disappointing. And to add insult to injury, the steak was automatically cooked to medium (borderline well-done) resulting in a sad, chewy mess.   We also ordered the \"Sweet Potato Hash\" to share which essentially was chopped boiled sweet potato. To salvage both of our bowls, my friend and I found ourselves dousing everything in Cholula - so, like, at this point, is it even healthy anymore?   As a Bay Area transplant, I have to compare Farm & Craft to Tender Greens in California (a chain that specializes in healthy, farm-to-fork cuisine) and say that F&C absolutely pales in comparison when it comes to flavor, portion size, and price point.   Kudos for being cute and having Instagrammable decor, but that's about it.",

The outdoor seating is a great place to sit on a nice day and it's in a super convenient location right in old town Scottsdale.

    "text": "Let me start off this review by saying this place has SO much potential. My husband and I were so excited to see it pop up in Scottsdale and were immediately convinced it would be one of our new favorite spots just from the looks of it. Through the grapevine, we had heard some lackluster reviews about the place, but decided to give it a try for lunch today anyways.   First things first, the ambience of this place is awesome. It's so cute and charming, airy and perfect for the beautiful days we (finally) get this time of year. I love it- from the decor to the bar to the music they play. It all fits together and is just a great place to be, especially when it's nice and busy like it was today at lunch. It's so cute, in fact, that we were absolutely shocked to find out its owned by the same group that owns whiskey row & el hefe. The concepts couldn't be more different!  Now what makes this place three stars... 1) service was alright but nothing special. It's a little confusing to tell if it's a sit down restaurant with service or a place you order up at the counter at. When push comes to shove, I'd much rather have just ordered at the counter and not paid a tip for the sparse service we received.  2) the food. I'm so sad to say that the food we received was average at best. I had read some reviews before we came that had stated time and time again hat the portions were small, which we were okay with since we expected it, but wow not even a little mixed greens come with an 11 dollar wrap? Crazy. I ordered the turkey wrap and was horribly unimpressed. The wrap itself honestly tasted (and held up) like a store bought flatbread wheat wrap with hardly any flavor. The iceberg lettuce and big chunks of under-ripened tomato didn't help either. I get that this place is healthy and I appreciated hummus being the \"sauce\" for the wrap, but the whole thing ended up being so bland and underwhelming that I was bummed to have bought it. My husband ordered the steak sandwich, which was admittedly much better due to the horseradish sauce, peppers, and marinated onions. They should add some of those elements (or something with more flavor) to the turkey wrap.   Side note that the cold brew coffee was bomb! I ordered the small which was plenty and I enjoyed it a lot. Great taste, and doesn't leave you feeling TOO hyped up on caffeine.   We will likely be back for drinks & to enjoy the location & decor, but not for food. With so many awesome brunch places in Scottsdale, this place needs to step its game up. I'd equate the cost of this place to a ChopShop or FlowerChild, and they both have way larger portions of absolutely delicious healthy & fresh food!",

The atmosphere was bright and open and the service at lunch was easy...order at the desk and they bring it to your table. I was there with a friend and it was easy to have conversation without too much background noise. I asked the manager for her recommendations and she offered up two.  We both went for the Rustic Salmon Bowl...Great Choice! The veggies were cooked perfectly with a nice combination of Brussel sprouts, broccolini, carrots, and roasted cauliflower. Paired with the quinoa and the salmon it was delicious. I'm not a huge salmon fan but the fish was cooked perfectly and was a nice sized portion. I felt satisfied and not too full.   We hung out for an hour afterwards and had a nice time in a relaxed atmosphere. Nice job!  I'll be back for sure to try one of the savory burritos.",

The location is great with plenty of nearby parking options. The atmosphere: bright and cheery. The menu: a decent selection of healthy items ranging from Acai bowls to more hearty scrambles. It seemed to have so much going for it, but neither of us left feeling eager to come back. Healthy doesn't have to be bland. I ordered the crustless quiche, which was dry, lacking flavor and served along side lightly dressed greens that were on the brink of no longer being fresh. The saving grace of both our meals was the coffee! Food aside, it's also incredibly noisy making it difficult to carry on a conversation.",

I've been here twice so far, the first time we tried this place on a whim when we went to Scottsdale for the first time. It looked a little intimidating at first since I thought it was a wine bar but I wanted to try new things so I convinced our group to stop there. I'm so glad I did cause it was very chill and not intimidating at all. We were seated outside and just felt peaceful and happy with the music playing in the back. I love a place with loud music but not loud enough that you can't talk. I felt that it had the perfect volume to immerse you in the happy songs!   It was happy hour so we ordered the avocado hummus and a few drinks. The drinks were absolutely delicious and not too light either. I NEED to go back and try all of them! The hummus came out and we were blown away. We are hummus fanatics and this was perfect for us! Not too thin or thick served with pita and an array of vegetables. We actually ended up ordering another plate of it because it was so good (we were only there for a stop-by on our tour of Scottsdale food),   The second time we went we again had amazing food altho the service was a bit slow. The wait staff was super nice and apologetic that it really made up for it! I will definitely be back to sample more of the menu!",

Interesting menu but tries a bit too hard to sell the random health facts about their food.  If you're looking for a casual hip place with both inside and outside seating and are in the mood for something that tries to be a bit healthier give this place a shot.",

The person at the counter did not know anything about the menu and, rather than asking someone with more knowledge, gave False information. I ordered the breakfast toast dish. I asked if it was like a french toast and she said yes. It came out as an overly thick piece of dry toast with cheese, strawberries, and an overpowering amount of herbs on it. My wife ordered a chicken dish which lacked any semblance of flavor or even salt on it. The piece of chicken was the only edible thing on it. It was way overpriced for the flavorless food we got.",

My main issue is that they are marketing themselves as a sustainable, healthy restaurant but no one seems to know why exactly the salmon is labeled as \"sustainable\" and the menu labeling for different health options is just over the top and bizarre. If your theme is healthy and sustainable you should at least educate your staff on what that means. Their marketing has outpaced their reality.",

The food was just ok and they didn't offer any vegetarian entrees. For a healthy restaurant, they still catered to carnivores only. The lone bright spot was the Faroe Mac N Cheese",

    "text": "I really like that they promote a wellness and anti-inflammatory diet. Stopped in for a drink with my friend. We walked in and were not sure whether to order at the counter or sit down. There was young woman training someone and they both told us we could order at the counter. The watermelon drinks brought us in so we ordered one each. We took a number and sat at a table. The bartender brought out our drinks and when we tried them, we were trying to figure out if they had alcohol or not. I asked a server if there was alcohol and he went to the bartender to ask. He came back and said yes. My friend then decided to go and ask how much an extra shot was to another bartender and she said $9. These drinks tasted like watermelon juice with water. At $15 a drink, I would expect a bit more. I then asked the other bartender (that made them) and she stated,\"oh yea I definitely put vodka in those.\" She walked away and left her shift. We saw people come in and sat right down, with a server immediately offering them waters and menus. I don't really understand if this is a Panera type atmosphere or restaurant style but not once were we offered water (until the host came 45 min later to just check on us) or if we wanted food.  Unfortunately, when I checked my statements a few days later, there was an added tip on top of the tip I had left at the beginning. It's really not about the money because it was very minimal and could have been an honest mistake by the new host. But after all that? All I am saying is when you go, be sure to check your bank statements if you pay card.",

We sat at our table for a good 5-7 minutes and were left sitting there without any server coming up to bring us water, take a drink order or anything? Meanwhile the entire staff was goofing around laughing and trying to look cool, chic and hipster. Deadbeats is what I call the staff. Owners need to hire some people who actually will work harder at their job and less at trying to be cool. Thing is they didn't even care when I got up and left.  Lame.",

    "text": "We were recommended to Farm and Craft from a friend when I talked about the difficulty of finding a restaurant that has a gluten free menu. She recommended we try Farm and Craft since it was close to work. What an exceptional stroke if luck! Their menu isn't huge, but so much of their food is gluten free and organic. Even some items not listed as gluten free can be made so!!  My wife wanted to try the grilled cauliflower steak but really wanted some protein, so she opted for the grass fed burger with salas bad avocado. She had them hold the bum (protein style) and I got the grilled salmon on pea puree. Both entrees were delicious and well prepared. Now I've read some reviews about price, flaws and service but what we got was outstanding.  Price fell well within our expected range ($50 for 2 people) and service was exceptional. Our waitress was spot on with explanations and options, refilling my tea and just being a great service provider. I highly recommend Farm and Craft. Even without the food allergies  it's a terrific place for food and drink.",

The beets with one chef have the sauce on top after the beats have been cooked which tastes better, the other chef cooks the beets with the sauce...doesn't taste as good. The steak is good, the salmon is good, but again depending on which chef is cooking. Last time I came here my salmon was raw inside and that is unacceptable since I'm pregnant and can't eat raw fish, but again the lack of consistency here is ridiculous and clearly this restaurant has no respect for its pregnant customers as this could be a serious issue eating raw fish.  Start charging Denny's prices because that represents the quality and consistency of how your food is cooked.",

The chilled raw pad Thai was ok, but not impressive. We also had one of the flatbreads which was pretty good. Our server informed us that they were out of regular crust and only had gluten free, so we decided to try it. We were not informed that it would still be an upcharge even though it was our only choice. I found that disappointing as a customer.

The restaurant itself was super cute, I felt like I could post a picture of it on Instagram and get a lot of likes (i.e. the Affection Wall) and I'm sure that's what they were going for. The day we went it was unseasonably cold and for some reason they kept leaving the door to the outside open. I know the table next to us complained about it and at one point one of my family members got up and closed it ourselves. It was a bit ridiculous.   We tried to order the drinks served in the small watermelons, but they were sold out (bummer). No biggie, we ordered the grapefruit Paloma drinks - however that was a letdown. Talk about all looks and no actual drink in the grapefruit. Such a letdown, especially for $11.   My food was actually pretty decent, I got the salmon poke bowl. I loved the marinade on the salmon and how fresh all the ingredients were. We also got the spinach and artichoke dip and I was also a fan of that! I had never thought to serve it with carrots but it worked.",

I really loved the cheat sheet of different types of diets to promote a variety of healthy living lifestyles.   I ordered a mimosa and it had the kind of OJ with the perfect amount of pulp. It was probably hand squeezed and soooo flavorful.  For food I had the breakfast burrito and my friend got the burger which was good too. The burrito came wrapped in a whole wheat think tortilla that was unlike anything I've had before. Very fresh and delicious. The burger wasn't overly huge but just enough to fill you up. Cooked to a nice medium and had all kinds of fixings to make it good.  I left there feeling like I had indulged in a healthy way...the best feeling!",

It was the perfect dining spot because my friend was just starting her cleanse and I was looking into healthier options.   Once arrived we were told the inside seating would be a wait but we could be seated outside. We chose to do so and there were plenty outdoor heaters to keep us warm. We decided on the avocado hummus for an appetizer and two kumbuchas for drinks.   Our waiter returns to tell us 20 mins later that the kitchen is running behind and the food is taking longer than usual. I didn't mind and appreciated the follow up except I think he forgot about our hummus.  We kept waiting and our hummus arrived about 10 more minutes later. It was very enjoyable and perfect because we hadn't eaten since breakfast. Our entrees came out fairly quickly after.   I ordered the roasted chicken and she chose the chicken farro mac n cheese bowl. My cauliflower mash was delectable but the chicken was slightly over cooked. My friends chicken was very dry. She made a comment about it but didn't want to send it back because we were starving as it is. She finished her plate anyway but I felt bad about it   I ordered us the paleo brownies for dessert. It was different but good. It's definitely an acquired taste.   I would like to return back to try their brunch options!",

She enjoyed hers but me not so much. (They didn't have bbq or ranch for toddlers meal) Mom's know most of our kiddos like dipping sauce.)  The service was lacking! My server didn't check to see how everything was at all. She disappeared. It took way to long to get our tab once we were done that we had to go up front to receive the check to pay.  Overall it wasn't the greatest experience this time around. It was a lot better about 6 months ago or so when i was in last.  Gonna stick to flower child.

    "text": "It's like all your perfectly-healthy friends who make you mindful of your own wellness, with lectures of gluten intolerance and inflammation and Mercury in retrograde teamed up and opened their own casual restaurant.   Farm & Craft, which specializes in neither farm-style comfort food nor craft cocktails is a bright, airy, health-conscious locale to have tons of fun, albeit with a little less guilt. On a Spring day, the way natural light pours in is energizing and positive. I absolutely love it!  The modest menu is comprised of mostly safe selections, but with twists designed to make them a bit higher quality (or at least healthier). For example, grass-fed beef, flax seed & whole wheat carbohydrates, and chicken/fish from small, reputable sources. I enjoyed my BBQ Chicken flatbread. With the addition of black beans, I am sure this was packed with fiber, which is cool. The chicken was unnoticeable, and what I did notice appeared to be *gasp* unseasoned, so if they ever want to just give up on that and pencil it in as a vegetarian item, it'll probably fare much better.   When it comes to the drink menu, kombucha cocktails absolutely steal the show. I don't find these to be particularly complex or awe-inspiring. If cocktails are an art, these are a gimmick. But they are refreshing gimmick you should try if for no other reason than to satisfy your curiosity. I went with the kombucha habanero, which was...kombucha and habanero vodka. I also tried the bourbon variety, which had plenty of banana flavor as well. If this isn't up your alley, you'll find a limited selection of other cocktails. Four are some decent looking fruity cocktails, and four are just comprised of basic liquors served in grapefruits or halved watermelons. These look amazing for presentation, which is why I ordered one, but the quantity of booze you're getting is minuscule.   Yes, I paid $11 to drink less than one shot of Tito's out of a grapefruit. I deserve to be made fun of.   Anyways, let's talk about the service. It's slow. Painfully slow. I felt like just one person had all the tables. Drinks took 15 minutes to arrive. Getting our checks at the end (for a party of about 10) was a 40-minute process. Lunch was 3 hours.   To conclude, Farm & Craft is vaguely health-conscious and very aesthetic, but that doesn't necessarily translate into taste or culinary creativity. If you're in the mood for guilt-free food, but you also want to booze it up, this place will work, even if it does feel like you're compromising a bit on both ends. I would personally prefer to go to one place for light bites and another for cocktails. I would also come back to grab some goodies to-go. It's OK.",

Decorated in a farmhouse-chic and simple style, the place looks like it's been torn out of a Home and Garden magazine. The location is very picturesque, with large windows and a lot of natural light, making Farm & Craft a great place to have brunch and take photos.   However, I was severely underwhelmed with the food here. To start, we got the roasted artichoke and spinach dip, and when served warm was great, but left everyone wondering why they only gave us six chips. From the dinner menu, we got the salmon poke bowl and the tocoa steak bowl. No complaints about the food makeup itself, other than the portions are really small and a little disappointing for its price point and location. The poke bowl was very okay, and with all the new poke and healthy-option places springing up in the valley, Farm & Craft is going to have to work harder to have their food leave an impression on its guests.",

    "text": "It's ironic that, in a restaurant that features a wide variety of non-vegan and vegan menu items, the best thing I ate was the Vegan Nachos. The, what I would assume, house-made tomatillo salsa was great. The vegan cheese was more than acceptable. Frankly, the only thing I would change with the dish would be to use normal tortilla chips. The Quinoa and Flax chips are barely a poor substitute for a corn tortilla chip. And, by using a corn tortilla chip, it might enable the kitchen to actually heat up the dish enough to melt more of the cheese. The melted vegan cheese is tasty. The unmelted vegan cheese leaves a bit of an aftertaste in your mouth. My daughter ordered the Vegan Flatbread and was amazed at how fresh and delicious the tomato on the flatbread, in combination with the olives, tasted.   I ordered the Flank Steak, a local, grass-fed steak served sliced with cheddar cauliflower mash, tomato confit & chimichurri. Frankly, even the chimichurri sauce wasn't enough to save me from just how boring and tasteless this particular steak was to me. It was cooked to order, medium rare. The color was perfect. I was just tasteless. I finally ordered some of the tomatillo salsa to drown it in anything that tasted of something.  The Cauliflower Mash was fine. I also ordered the side of brussels sprouts. I ordered it cooked well done, because, in my experience, very few restaurants actually seem to cook the glorious brussels sprout correctly so that they come out tender, and actually cooked. Most seem to just toss them in a pan for 2 minutes and call it a day. Frankly, if they would just steam them until 3/4 done, it would completely ramp up the dish in every restaurant that offers grilled or roasted brussels sprouts. So, back to Farm and Craft's version. It sucked. Dry, hard, not just hard from undercooking, but some were hard from overcooking. Also, has anyone in the kitchen heard of salt? How a dish made with bacon, cranberries and walnuts could taste on none of these ingredients is a testament to the kitchen. Any one of those ingredients could lead the show. All three should be able to hit it out of the park. This was a strike and a miss.   One last annoyance. I ordered a drink from the bar, an Old Forrester on the rocks. If you are familiar with the bourbon bottom shelf of most liquor stores, then you will recognize this brand. For the uninitiated, it's a $14 bottle of bourbon that plays well above it's weight class. As has become typical these days, F&C charges, on their menu, $10 for this particular bourbon. When I get my bill, I'm charged an extra $3 for \"rocks\". This immediately, after the less than stellar dinner, infuriates me. I really don't understand the theory behind this charge. If customers are pissed because you are such a tight wad restaurant that the drink looks too small in your bar glassware, perhaps you should get different glassware. It's one thing to measure out a 25 year old Macallan that costs more than $1800 a bottle, it's quite another to charge $13 for less than $1.50 worth of bourbon. It's insulting, and had lead me to order water most of the time when I go out for meals or drinks.   So, if I ever go back, I'll stick to the vegan nachos, the vegan flat bread, and water.",

We ordered the avocado hummus, crustless quiche, and a protein bowl - all of which were fantastic.  The service was a little slow at times, but this place was hoppin', so I don't blame them for the lull in response. We also ordered a drink that came out as a grapefruit-filled with Tito's and a cranberry ice cube mimosa. No fillers, no b.s. Just good food.",

Chilled raw pad thai was more interesting. The texture of the vegetable noodle was good and the pad thai sauce had more citrus flavor. Lavender lemonade was really good with a hint of lavender flavor. Lemonade was not too sweet.   The only downside is that we went there for dinner. It seems like they have more variety of menu options for breakfast&brunch (which makes sense since the food is light and healthy).",

A tad crowded though -- although crowded is a good thing when you have a business; it means your place is poppin'!   Started off our Friday night of shenanigans with a few close friends at the bar. Wasn't insanely busy, but definitely picked up as the night went on. Our bartender was super sweet and informative about their menu, drinks, etc. and was able to recommend drinks off the menu. I took his word for it and ordered the Wellness Martini. It was meh -- tasted more like a smoothie than a martini, and took quite a long time to get.   One of my friends ordered just tequila, lime, with a splash of grapefruit juice -- her signature drink... with NO simple syrup or agave, EVER! but the bartender snuck some agave in there... really, dude? Who does that? A girl knows what she wants; don't ever mess up a girl's chi with her drink. We saw him do it and then he wouldn't even admit to it, but he did remake it -- the way my friend ordered it from the get-go. (Not sure why guys don't like to listen???)   I know this place just opened so I'm still giving it 4-stars; it definitely has potential, but there are some \"kinks\" that need to be worked out for sure. And perhaps speed up the drink service? I know they're made fresh and \"with love\", but I was getting antsy waiting!",

Confirmed brunch reservation for a group of 13 celebrating a special occasion was not communicated to the restaurant by its own staff. While our group waited 20+ minutes for other tables at management's request ~  1. We were not offered the large table that was ready because they were holding it for another group our size that was coming in after us. Farm & Craft could've seated us promptly and offered the later group the tables they were pulling together for us that would be ready \"soon\". 2. Other tables right next to each other became available. Farm & Craft could've seated us promptly and pulled together several tables together.  Instead people that arrived after us were seated. 3. We were not offered a beverage or anything at all during our wait.  Subpar customer service, to be honest.  We took our business to the brewery across the street. That was a good call.",

I asked for my steak to be medium rare and it came out well.  No pink at all.  I sent it back and it came back the same way. Ugh!  All in all, it came out to over $120 for the four of us.

Before leaving, the chef ended up striking a conversation with me about this berry jam I was looking at. He grabbed a spoon, opened a jar up and let me try some and then just gave me a brand new jar to take with me. I now am back at my hotel room, just finished the juice and am halfway through this meal.. all I can say is I had a great experience and they serve delicious food.

    "text": "This place is awesome!! Not only do they have an exceedingly healthy menu, but they further assist the health conscious by labeling items with specific benefits, such as probiotic increase or anti-inflammatory properties. The fresh made juices are also delicious and very nutritious. It reminds me of a Chop Shop or Flower Child, only classier.   I highly recommend the Cali Chicken bowl and Grilled Pineapple & Bacon Flatbread! We ordered the latter as an appetizer for the table, and upon the first bite, immediately regretted not getting one for myself (as did everyone else at the table!).  The ambience is inviting and intriguing, making this dining experience great for a romantic date or a family gathering. Additionally, they were very accommodating to our party of five. We arrived 12 minutes before the kitchen closed, and they obliged our orders and took our picture even. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys healthy cuisine that tastes amazing.",

The food/menu theme has a spiffy lifestyle choice for things like anti-inflammatory, stress relief, detox and another I totally forget. We loved the drinks-kudos to the bartender, the drink menu is artisan style! Wine selection pretty concise. App portions good for 4 hungry felines  and most of the options were rather healthy which we are ALL about! We started with the hummus app and a grilled veggie bowl with these great dips. I had one of their Farro based bowls. It has a good flavor but the Farro was served al dente. Thanks to the staff and manager for such a great night!",

I am not sure if there is new management or what but we both have noticed some things that have turned us away from going. When you walk in, you are not acknowledged. The hostess who is supposed to check you in always has their back to you which can sometimes feel awkward. The food consistency has also changed. Our meals have been without salad dressing or some meals fail to have all the ingredients stated on the menu. We were regulars so we are pretty familiar with what is supposed to come with and on our meals. Also, the service is so slow and the staff seem to want nothing to do with you. We spend time waiting for silverware or looking for someone to help us pay the bill. I am a bit taken back by the lack of hospitality we have noticed recently. Anyways the food is pretty great and we really enjoyed it before this all happened.",

Our server seemed like she didn't want to be there and as far as the details went (bringing plates for the appetizers, getting a drink for the new arrival, asking if we wanted another drink, etc...) she lacked.  I asked her a few questions about ingredients and she had no clue.  I would recommend knowing the menu you are working with.  I've been to the 7th St location a few times and have always had a great experience so we will stick with that one moving forward.

It is a little pricey, but they've got a full bar, friendly bartenders, fresh squeezed juice, and an incredible California-y atmosphere with floor to ceiling windows. I got the tasty sweet potatoes hash dish and the cocktails we had (watermelon type of drink and one with cucumber and vodka) were absolutely delicious!",

    "text": "I used to frequent Farm and Craft quite often and always enjoyed the food, service and ambiance - but over time, the shine has tarnished. It's as though they willingly go out if their way to drive away potential customers.  1. A few weeks ago, I brought a few health-oriented friends who were excited about their menu and eager to try their food. We park a block away and hear this god awful auto-tuned club music blaring. It sounded like chainsaws and wood chippers set to a beat. I joke that the W pool party must be raging, but as we get closer, it's coming from Farm and Craft! We are young, we like music, but this was SO LOUD and obnoxious total crap music blaring that it was downright hilarious.  The music literally pushed us all away and we disappointedly went elsewhere for brunch.  2. A friend and I were craving grass-fed burgers and we've always liked the ones served at Farm and Craft.  As we walk to door, we see several open tables both outside on the patio as well as inside. The host informs us there is a 15 - 20 minute wait. What?  Open tables all clean and set with silverware and yet we must wait? We left and went elsewhere.   Basically, I want to eat at Farm and Craft, but the damn place keeps pushing me and my friends away.  Now I go to Modern Market just down the street because they are always up for serving healthy food to willing customers.",

I really wish the chairs were more comfortable for you can't have it all. Overall great place to share a bite and a drink.",

One of the waitresses cut off another while they were walking away with dishes and the other rolled her eyes and called her a 'f***ing b***h'. Pretty unsettling for brunch time. 3. There seemed to be a disconnect between the hostess and the waiter/waitress team as about 1/3 of the seating were open, but there was at least 10 of us still waiting to be seated. I know sometimes restaurants do this to look like they're a hot spot that's busy, but this wasn't working. 4. Our waiter was nice and knew his stuff, but seemed to be out of it as well as he missed a few details in my order like not bringing any cream with my coffee.   Overall I think this place has a lot of potential, beautiful design, great healthy food, but needs to be better managed to clean up the edges.",

We each ordered an entree, my girlfriend ordered a cocktail. He brought her her drink ( i was drinking water) That was the last time our server came to the table  When our food was ready, a different server brought the food. No one checked to see if the food was ok (it was ). Never got a fill on our water. We even sat for quite awhile with our plates empty until we finally asked a different server to get our waiter to get a check. That waiter forgot to grab our original server so we waited longer. Then we grabbed that server again and asked him for our check (we had been done eating for at least 20 min now). He apologized and told us that our server was training to be a manager so he was real busy (my friend had been watching him chatting about tattoos and socializing with the table behind us). If he in fact was training to be a manager he is going to be a horrible manager. Like I said he started out great, but the impression from our visit will prevent either of us from going back",

    "text": "I never write yelp reviews, but i feel that Farm & Craft deserves one. With so much competition in the valley, I was hesitant F&C would be over shadowed... Boy was I wrong! This place is killer! I have become a bit addicted, and am working my way through the menu. Here are my favorites from each section of the menu so far-  Bowls: Rustic Farm Bowl served with basil kale pesto.. such a game changer! Wraps: Turkey Wrap is UNREAL. The flax pita is truly the best I have had in the valley. It has a little sweet kick which I love.  Build Your Own: Vegan Honey Roasted Carrots... words cannot describe how delicious these are! I had to order two extra sides after the first time I had them! I also got the Sweet Potato Hash, Farro Mac & Cheese, and the Garbanzo beans and goat cheese, with chicken. All super tasty!  Salads: KALE CESAR. Living in the scottsdale/arcadia area, the word \"kale\" has become as popular as water at restaurants. However, this is the best kale salad hands down!!!   I also tried the chocolate protein shake yesterday and it was so delicious. Sweet but refreshing, and healthy!   I have never felt so passionate about a new concept! It is seriously amazing every time I go in. I love how from open-3pm it is fast casual, but then 3pm- close is full service. It is the perfect balance because sometimes Friday night rolls around and you want healthy food, but still a nice, fun environment. Farm & Craft is the place!!",

It's got a very modern and cute ambiance, got a table right away (at 11am on a Sunday even), the service is fabulous, and the food is amazing (and healthy). Loved it! The only reason why not five stars is the music is so loud you definitely find yourself having to kind of shout and say \"huh\" with people your trying to catch up with. Nice music, but people want to have conversation while their eating at your fabulous place too. You sign says \"All I want is food and affection.\" Well the affection part needs to happen there while shouting! Lol. That is the only negative though...great over all! Glad I went!!",

Service was sub-par at best.  Although we may have just had a poor server - the rest of the tables appeared happy with their service.  The beer taps weren't working because it was too warm???  Agreed it was hot out but when you're a craft beer business I would think that might be something you consider in Phoenix AZ.  The food was ok - interesting and certainly fresh.  We had a mushroom flatbread that was way too heavy in truffle oil and arugula and way too light in mushrooms while the crust was tasteless.  The roasted chicken was - well, weak at best.  Over cooked and tough.    The concept certainly is interesting but I won't be back.  It pales to any other farm to table restaurants I've eaten at.  And the craft selection even if working was poor.",

Next we ordered our food after waiting 15 minutes for a waitress to take our order. Next we waited 35 minutes before food showed up. It was cold. Next we actually tasted our food and it was the bland with no flavor and grossly overpriced for what it was. We ordered coffee and sugar. We waited 10 minutes to get our sugar. At that point the coffee was cold as well. We wait another 10 minutes for a waitress to come back but she didn't so we had to go to the front And ask for a check. It's funny as we were leaving that the person next to us asked a different waitress to make the food again because it was cold.....We will never go back.... please be smart and trust the yelp reviews. I don't like to review places that don't deserve it but it's worth mentioning that the place and location are trendy and nice.",
