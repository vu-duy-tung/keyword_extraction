I got seated & served within 15 minutes..  Try their roast pan & pinot grigio wine! This wine got me insane and I went to do a night trip at 12 am .. Went to flagstaff driving on the 87 then 260 .. And got back home on i17 south ...  Anyways, when I woke up next day, I was like ****ing wine!!! Lol",

    "text": "I am a big fan of Cajun food and so happy to have found Ocean Trail.  Have not really found a Cajun restaurant around Scottsdale.  We had lunch and enjoyed their lunch menu offerings.  The lunch sizes are smaller than the dinner portions but quite filling.  The meal also included some soft bread and butter.  I had the crawfish etoufee with crab and dirty rice.  They have a spice scale of 1-10.  I requested a \"3\" which they suggested was equivalent of tobasco sauce.  I thought it had a good kick, but the tables also have a variety of Louisiana spice sauces, which I added to my dish.  I really enjoyed the dish.  My wife ordered the combo gumbo with shrimp, chicken and crab and dirty rice.  It had great flavor and was full of seafood.  The gumbo had great flavor as well.   We shared a caesar salad which was good.  The service was good.  We thought the meal was affordable for the quality of the food ($35 before tip).  The only slight negative is the location of the restaurant.  It is very small and set right off the casino floor.  There are only a few tables and bar-type seating.  There is quite a bit of traffic from individual's walking around the casino as well as the smoke from smoker coming off the casino floor.  In spite of this small negative, I will definitely be back.",

I have had cajun, New Orleans style food once, in New Orleans, about 10 years ago so I really didn't know what to expect since it had been so long and I didn't even remember what I ordered. The server suggested and appetizer and 1 meal for 2 people to split and it was perfect, just enough food. We started with shrimp in a garlic broth. I wanted to pick up the bowl and drink the broth it was so good!. Two pieces of bread soaked in the broth later, and lots of shrimp, our crawfish and crap ettouffee came out. It was so full of flavor and a very large portion. It was packed with plenty of crawfish and crab.   Luckily our server explained the heat ratings to us because he said it was 1-10 and I immediately said we want 6. Well, their 6 is not what I was thinking because he said a 3 is tabasco sauce! We went with 3 on both dishes and it had just the right amount of heat.   This is a really good restaurant and I can't wait to go back. It is worth every penny and the wait.",

    "text": "Been to Ocean Trail about 8 times over the past 8 months or so and have tried something different each visit (ordered raw oysters every visit but enjoyed different variety everytime). The oysters are always fresh, cold and delicious! The jumbo shrimp cocktail is excellent also but I believe the shrimp are slightly smaller now than when I first came here...not sure?  I personally love the gumbo but have tried pan roasts and etouffee all with either lump crab meat or shrimp and found both crab or shrimp to be plentiful and fulfilling along with the mix of all ingredients. As mentioned by most yelper's, choose your heat wisely but have found 7 to be pretty standard and not too spicy but very flavorful. Please note that one of the lady chef's (not sure of her name but slightly smaller build and a little older than the other chef's) definitely prepares the dishes better than the others but for the most part, food has been consistently good.  The corn chowder is also a favorite but haven't tried the clam chowder yet but have heard numerous recommendations from other guests. The warm, toasty bread that accompanies your meal goes perfectly with anything you order, especially the soups and pan roasts.  One of the most outstanding aspects of this place is the camaraderie amongst the guests @ the bar. I've been very fortunate to meet some truly outstanding people everytime while dining here. My neighbors @ the bar shared numerous stories about their lives, both locals and people visiting from other parts of the US or world, as we sat and enjoyed food and drinks together. The bar staff can be a little hit or miss though but have always met expectation. Like every place, some bartenders truly enjoy what they do while others just show up for work.  Even if you don't necessarily want to gamble, you'll definitely come out a winner everytime after dining @ Ocean Trail! Enjoy!",

We stood around for awhile before without being addressed, ended up just taking a seat (all the tables were empty).  Took a while before being asked about drinks and bread was served to two tables seated after us before I had to ask for any.

It was so spicy and we ordered level 3 spicy. Everything though was super fresh and tasty. We sat belli up and the bar to see them make our dishes with their fresh spices.   Husband was super full and happy and he said this restaurant made our roster. This means we will be coming back a lot sooner for some more yummy goodness.",

As seafood restaurants go it is exceptional, as louisiana style goes it is the best in Arizona and rivals the best restaurants in New Orleans. From the moment you are seated by Jaime and Ryan you are transformed.  Sit at the bar if you can and say hello to Tip. You will never have a better meal or experience then having Tip cook for you right before your eyes. And if your daring get your food spiced to a level 10 with a side of \"Tip sauce\" you will never no what hit you. Throw in CeCe, Eric, Evan and Wu and a better team you will not find. I have been to some of the finest restaurants around and they pale in comparison to food, ambience and customer service. We were here on Monday, tonight Friday and will be back again tomorrow  That's how good Ocean Trail is!!",

It has a nice modern feel and the \"kitchen\" is right there in the bar with the chef using interesting steam woks to cook food in front of you. We had the Bloody Mary that comes with a Cajun shrimp. So flavorful and spicy. Delicious!  Two of us shared the cold seafood platter for two. It was amazing esp for only $43. It seemed there was a pound of lump crab alone!  The oysters were fresh and flavorful, the prawns were huge and firm, the clams tender and tasty, and the lump crab so meaty and sweet. The mussels were standard but by no means bad. I would go back to the resort just for this platter, if I ever return to Scottsdale. I would also like to try their hot dishes like jambalaya some time, but the seafood platter was so huge we couldn't even finish it!",

    "text": "My cousin introduced me to this spot. At first I questioned the location since it is stuffed in the back corner of the casino near the 25 cent slot machines.  When I arrived, I was quickly impressed on the amazing cajun/seafood selection, freshness, and service.    We sat at the bar (recommended) and ordered a few plates (beer prawns), etouffee, pan roast (go with combo!), while accompanied by wine and oyster shots.  I know the food was amazing to begin with... and after many drinks, I thought it was food for the gods.    The service was very attentive and friendly.  The spice level: I went with 7 (apparently this has ghost peppers in it, which explains why I drank so much).  You can choose spice level from 1-10, with 1 for newbie spice aficionados and 10 for those who want to roll around on the ground crying afterwards.   I actually went back at a later date since I wanted to reconfirm the quality (plus I only had one glass of wine).  And True enough, the food was as good as I remembered it.  One more star for great service and remembering me from the previous visit.   There's also live entertainment around the corner with a decent lounge/bar, so a nice option to wander over after your meal.  They also have happy hour, so if you get there early, you can also enjoy while preserving your pocketbook.",

We both ordered the pan roast and you can select either crayfish, shrimp or crab meat in your roast. I selected a combo of all three and my husband had the crayfish. You also can choose the amount of \"heat\" you want from a scale of 0-10. I choose 0 while my husband choose 7 and thought he could go higher next time. Since I don't like spicy zero was plenty for this wimp. The pan roast is made in a delicious lobster-citrus broth and it is packed with seafood. it comes with either a dirty rice, our choice, or you can get white rice. The dirty rice with the roast was perfect. It also comes with fresh warm, yeasty, soft rolls to dunk into the wonderful sauce. We noticed that the sanitation is very good the chef kept removing gloves as he touched the fish wand while cooking so there was no cross-contamination. The prices are very reasonable too. Will definitely return.",

The restaurant is small and in the casino but it is worth it.  My recommendation is to go early or on a Sunday because it can get busy and have a major wait. If you are not a gumbo fan don't worry because they have a pan roast that is fabulous, and chowder. Don't forget to try the oyster shooter (oyster, Bloody Mary, vodka in a shot glass).",

When eating you would hope that someone is not blowing a huge cloud of smoke in your face. We ordered the clams and the shrimp boil. The shrimp was pretty solid and spiced to our level of tolerance. The clams were MEH. The waiter after serving us our dish confirmed that the clams were awful.  This really pissed me off. First off, this restaurant was chosen in 2012 for best seafood of the year, and the waiter can't recommend something that dosent suck!?! So, I was ready to leave that place still hungry. My wife however, dosen't leave places hungry, and was ready to try another dish. We decided to split the Seafood Creole. Now, the Creole was unbelievable. My wife and I travel to Nola often and you would be hard pressed to find a better dish. The scallops were perfectly cooked. The spice was a masterpiece and by the end of the dish we were licking the plate. If I were to go to this restaurant again I would make sure to press the waiter for the best seafood at that time. Do not go in there a blindly order something because it sounds good. The resturant will sacrfice quality in order to fullfill the menu.",

Their Thanksgiving special included crab legs, lobster tail, shrimp, mussels, rice, and corn on the cob.  One thing was better than the next!  The shrimp were so fresh and tasty.  The crab legs were tender.  The lobster had so much meat inside.  The mussels were even amazing (and I don't normally even like them!).  They were all served in a spicy sauce (you get to choose the spicy level 1-10 for all you wimps). I have had seafood in many different parts of the country and this may be the best plate of seafood I have ever had and at 40 bucks it was a huge steal.   We sat there enjoying our amazing meal while a line snaked around the entire casino for the buffet and all I could think was SUCKAZ!! hahaha  I cannot imagine they had anything better let alone anything worth that wait. The only thing I will warn you about is that this place looks like an airport bar.  It literally looks like they may not even serve food beyond appetizers, but don't be fooled.  That being said it's not the best place for romantic ambiance, but that's okay because you can take the elevator right up to Orange Sky for an after dinner drink (also recommended).",

Line may be get long; so avoid dining rush hours. SERVICE was solid.  FOOD: Corn chowder was salty.  However, when it comes to the seafood pan roast - it was unforgettable.  Every bite had seafood and the seasoning was perfect.  The only caution is the spiciness.  I usually eat very, very spicy, so I thought a Level 9 would be ok... but that pan roast made me sweat and tear up in the eyes... it was too spicy.   I think if I were to go back next time, I would stick to level 7, so that I can actually taste and enjoy the food.  The best pan roast chef if \"Tip\", a very nice Asian lady.",

There are no reservations so come early if you don't want to wait or wait for a long time. 2. This place is not a True \"restaurant style\" space. It's literally a section off the casino floor that you might think looks good but don't want to wait in line. WAIT IN LINE. Trust me! The gumbo is why I come here. You can order it spice level 0-10 and trust me, it packs a punch!! Portions are huge and extremely satisfying! I love this food so much! To me, there is nothing like this in Arizona (or nothing I know of) and is definitely worth a try. Come here with friends or on a date, it's a great restaurant.

    "text": "Love, love , love this place. It is a \"hidden gem\" among the locals for sure. I think that it is  definitely one of the best places for seafood in the Vally and most definitely one of the best priced! The gumbo is fantastic as are most of the other dishes you can order. I love the seating and the atmosphere. But the real show is the chef that cooks the meal with the steamers behind the circular counter. What a treat to see how it skilled they are. The service is tops too!",

    "text": "I've been to Ocean Trail 3-4 times and think I have a good feel for the place.  I am also a seafood and cajun food fanatic.   Disclaimer: It must first be said that this restaurant is essentially a nice bar at the edge of the main casino floor--it is not a sit-down, fine dining type of place. Though the design is interesting, the atmosphere is good it won't blow you away, and you should avoid sitting nearer to the casino as the occasional smoking gambler passes by and crop dusts your food with their cancer stick. Unappetizing to say the least. Try to get as far away from the casino floor as possible.   OK, now that the disclaimer is done: the food is really, really good, and surprisingly affordable for the quality and quantity that you get.  The specialties are a few types of cajun dishes: gumbo, pan roast, and seafood creole, with your choice of meat (shrimp, crab, oyster, crawfish, chicken)  or a combination of all meats. I've tried each preparation style and they are delicious. Very fresh ingredients prepared right in front of your eyes. The staff will ask you how spicy you want it on a scale of 1 to 10, so you can adjust the heat to your preference.  The other dishes and soups are equally tasty.  They also offer fresh oysters on the half shell, shrimp and crab cocktails, and a shellfish platter of oysters, jumbo shrimp, clams, mussels, and a ton of lump crab meat for only $25.  The seafood cocktails come with the spicient horseradish you've ever had, which is great for those of us who enjoy burn in our sinuses. They also have a full bar with specialty cocktails like oyster-based bloody marys and oyster/vodka shooters. I wouldn't recommend the oyster shooter, though..too much of a good thing.   The service is friendly and efficient, and also quite knowledgeable about the food and its preparation.  You get the feeling that the people who work there genuinely want you to enjoy your experience, which is unfortunately rare. All of this for very reasonable prices...getting fresh shrimp, oysters, etc. anywhere in the valley is usually an expensive proposition, but here $15-$17 gets you generous portions of very good food, and $25 gets you more shellfish than two people can finish.    If I had one complaint, it would be that the shellfish platter is not served with a white wine/butter/parsley accompaniment or even just drawn butter for the mussels. The shrimp and crab are the stars of the show, and the clams and oysters are fresh and tasty, but mussels do not have the same distinctive flavor as the other shellfish; they are a bit bland. It needs some sort of complimentary sauce.  In any event, if that's my biggest complaint after 3-4 visits, then they're doing a good job.  Worth a visit, even if you're not trying your luck at the casino.",

It's a smaller restaurant setup like a bar with stools surrounding the chefs' who prepare meals fresh in front of you. Each and every bowl of gumbo is prepared to your specifications (ie type of meat, fish, poultry, etc; spicy scale 1-10). They are cooked individually in a pot designed specifically for gumbo. Unfortunately, we have never tried anything else because the gumbo is the star of this restaurant. However, that is probably a good thing.",

Watch them fix your Cajun meal right in front of you in the steam pots.  I've been to New Orleans several times and this food stand up with meals I've had along Bourbon St.  The portions are large and flavorful.  They tend to run spicy ... You set the level on a scale of 1-10 when you order.  5 is as much as I can handle.  It's fun to watch if someone orders a 10 while you're there.  Everything I've had there is good including raw oysters, steamed shrimp, gumbo, and jambalaya.  Only thing that could have been better was the collard greens.  The bacon in them made them too salty.",

I am going to watch Chef Thipp make her awesome shrimp boil next time so I can see what she puts in it.  I order the shrimp boil at a 5/6 spice level my sister orders at a 10...(not sure how that's even possible to enjoy.:)  Have also ordered and thoroughly enjoyed the Corn Chowder which is a meal in itself.  Shrimp Cocktail which are giant prawns that are so perfectly cooked with a majorly robust horseradish side and some lemon...YUM!!!  Great Caesar Salad and all should be washed down with a Bloody that is house made and perfectly spicy without overwhelming with all of the other flavors going on.  Or, very nice wine selection that I've definitely sampled.  The service is always extremely attentive and kind.  Also, being that it's a very small space and we usually eat in the \"round\" of the bar...they are right there to get you what you need when you need it.  Yes, you might have a wait during peak times but I do not mind waiting for something this consistently delicious.  I never miss a visit when I'm in town! When there...get there!",

Not exactly romantic with the casino players in the back ground but the food is definitely worth the price and time spent.  The bread is out of this world and so is the gumbo. I cannot wait to try other things on the menu when i decide to go out with friends just for ocean trails. They do not stay open very late weekdays (9pm) but hopefully they stay open later weekends.  Since we only ordered gumbo they give you the option of how spicy you would like it 1-10 5 being moderately spicy(in my opinion it has awesome flavor a little kick not too much heat)(But if you cant do spicy this might be a tad too spicy a 3-4 would be moderate for you but i can do spicier)  I have never tried raw oysters but am willing to try next time and their are definitely cooked oysters in the gumbo along with shrimp and okra from what i remember along with a lot of other things as well along with some amazing dirty rice to mix in with it.

    "text": "(Lyrics - The Beach Boys - Surfer Girl)  Yummy seafood at Ocean Trail Made my belt come all undone Would you serve me would you Ocean Trail Ocean Trail my little Ocean Trail  I have watched you from the floor Standing by the casino's roar Would you serve me would you Ocean Trail Ocean Trail my little Ocean Trail  Ocean Trail is located in the heart of Talking Stick Casino.  Overall, it's crazy lines, smokers passing by, and gamblers galore!  I didn't really care for the openness of this place as patrons of the casino were strolling by.  I didn't wait at all since my family were here waiting for sometimes to get a table for us.  I ordered the Seafood Platter appetizer while my sister and I shared the Pan Roast Crab.  The appetizer came with 4 oysters and shrimps along with several mussels and clams.  Overall, I thought it was pretty good for being in a dessert.  For the price of $39 I guess in a sense it was well priced.  Overall, the freshness is the best it can be for being in a desert.  The Pan Roast Crab was pretty good.  Spicy as it should be but for me it lacked some texture.  If they added some beans or providing some crunch it would have been better.    Ocean Trail is definitely a popular spot in the casino, however if you were to first introduce me to Cajun/Creole food this would have been an atrocity.  Needless to say, there didn't seem to be a trained chef to provide the love.  In the end, if you needed a quick Cajun food fix this place will do just fine. - Enjoy!",

OCEAN TRAIL  My brother and I have made this our annual Thanksgiving dinner destination. We ordered their Thanksgiving Tower of Seafood that includes lobster, crab legs, lump crab meat, jumbo prawns, oysters, scallops,    hot dinner rolls, warm drawn butter, cocktail sauce and a aioli mayo for assorted dipping. A dessert of pumpkin mousse with gingerbread crumbles was phenomenal. They offer a number of Seafood options with a Cajun twist that other patrons were raving about. Ordering seafood in the desert can be risky but Ocean Trail ships in the freshest ocean fare available and it is awesome. The service is attentive from seating to ordering to serving within 15 minutes.   Ocean Trail is the Scottsdale \"go to\" seafood restaurant for those in the know who crave Cajun and ocean fare that is always fresh and presented by attentive staff.   $$$",

It was described to be a rich lobster-citrus broth finished with tomato cream but honestly it tasted just like straight tomato sauce and the crab got too lost in the sauce and basically taste like shredded chicken. Other than that, overall the experience was great. The waiter was very friendly and attentive. Plan on making this a regular spot.",

The gumbo combo has all kind of seafood in it, like shrimp, mussels, crawfish, oysters, etc..  The gumbo taste is alright, but the oysters makes me almost throw up.  The oysters in the gumbo are raw at room temperature in the hot gumbo, makes me feel it is not right, and not a good match.  I would has the oysters fully cooked rather than drop it in the gumbo in raw.  Don't get this wrong, I love to eat fresh raw oysters in half shell, but the oysters in the gumbo tastes like the oysters from the jars, and a bit of fishy.  If you have a good stomach, might go have a try (at risk).  If I go back again (less likely) will not order the one with oyster for sure...  The environment is super noises, everyone is yell out loud to make a conversation, live band with super loud speaker is right next room plus expect to be 2nd hand smoker, very smokey inside the casino.  Plus expect to wait in line for 30-60 minutes, the whole restaurant only has about 30 seats.    I would recommend Baby Kay for gumbo.  Taste better, better environment, and a bit cheaper.",

    "text": "First off, the ambience is the casino. Not good.  I knew it was in the casino, but I didn't realize until I saw it that it's practically on the floor with the noisy slots and smokers.  They really should put up some sort of glass partition and circulate fresher air for the patrons.  As it stands, loud, drunk, smoking people in the casino can walk right by your table (within inches) and not be in the restaurant.  Cigarette smoke is not helpful when trying to enjoy a meal.  I have to deduct a star for this.  The buffet is isolated from the casino, they should do something for this spot too.  It's really unfortunate.  The service was friendly and helpful.  A bit inattentive, perhaps, but they were always moving.  Very busy.  So it wasn't neglect.  Now for the food.  We started with the corn seafood chowder.  They warn you that it has a variety of seafood in it (squid, octopus, etc).  Not just clams or shrimps.  But don't let that bother you.  No one flavor stands out, and the seafood is chopped up small enough that you aren't going to get a mouthful of any one thing.  It was really quite tasty, though perhaps just a bit salty.  Then came the shrimp boil.  Basically shrimp boiled in a spicy sauce/broth.  It also was pretty good.  I don't know that I would rave about it as other reviewers have, but I had no problem with it either.  Lastly, the seafood creole.  I got it with the dirty rice.  The dirty rice is very good, but the amount was pretty small for the dish.  I would have doubled it if I were the chef.  The seafood dish itself was actually very similar to the shrimp boil, except there was other stuff besides just shrimp.  It also had scallops, clams, and some other things I wasn't sure about.  It was very good, but didn't really distinguish itself from the shrimp boil much.  The sauce was a bit thicker, but in terms of flavor very similar.  All in all a pretty good meal.  I think I like Pappadeaux's better, but still pretty good.  I'd give them four stars if it wasn't for the noise and smoke.  One nice feature was specifying your spice level on a 1-10 scale.  I liked that.  Another thing to be aware of is this place ain't cheap.",

At least we did...The portions were very large, enough to last for two more meals. Hubby and I ordered Seafood Creole and Crawfish Etouffee. The spice level 1 did the trick- it was a nice kick in the mouth but not to the point where my mouth felt like lava. The seafood was fresh and very very tasty. One thing that threw me off a little was when some of the crab pieces had shell, but I got over it. I would definitely return to this place.",

Their food was super fresh, excellently spiced, and reasonably priced. Portions were really big.   You can order drinks and chat while they prepare the food. Go for the seafood creole if you like the authentic seafood taste. The server will tell you to pick spiciness from 3-10. I went with a 5 and it would compare to a moderate leaning to spicy for American food.   Enjoy!",

If you go here, you must try their oyster shooter! It's ridiculously good, IMO. I always order their Cajon Jambalaya. It's mouth watering good. Every time I order this dish the next customer would ask what I had ordered. The dish definitely serve 2. Their oysters and shrimp cocktail are good too.  The cooks are great. Heck, generally speaking, the staff are great! There's a lady that works there (you may see her on the weekends, at night) she's been around for a long time. She's good at preparing your orders. Love watching her managing the small space.  Although the spaces are limited, but I think it's just right. Now for the pricing. I know seafood are expensive, but it's worth it here. Good service with good food, I'll pay the extra.   Enjoy!",

    "text": "Eating at a casino restaurant would normally not be a decision I'd choose, but Ocean Trail was a delightfully delicious surprise! Both the Seafood Corn Chowder and the Shrimp Broil were amazing. When ordering the broil, one has a choice of spiciness from 1-7.  My husband chose 4 and it was right on point. Not too spicy but very flavorful with fresh-tasting shrimp.   The Caesar salad and warm, fresh bread were also very tasty. As far as only giving 4 stars instead of 5, the entrees took a very long time to come out. But, as mentioned above, everything was extremely fresh and piping hot, so I can't really complain. My advice would be to definitely order more (free) bread and get either an appetizer or salad to hold you over.   Another piece of advice would be to eat at an odd time as the line can get quite long- more objective evidence of how delicious the food is! We went around 2:30pm and were seated right away. However, once we left around 5:00pm, there was quite the line waiting to be seated.",

Extremely nice chefs and servers who know how to seriously take care of their customers!  Well worth the price for the quality and serving sizes you receive.  The bread they give you is also absolutely fantastic!  Can't say enough great things about Ocean Trail.  Word to the wise, go during off peak hours as in Mid Afternoon and after 8pm.  It's very small and gets very busy as it's extremely popular and has a huge following!  Love it in large fashion!",

Second, the clam chowder was the best my boyfriend has had. I personally think there could have been a bit more clam chunks. Lastly, the portion for the pan roast is giant. My boyfriend and I shared one and we were full. The base sort of tastes like a pasta sauce-tomato-y and they certainly do not skimp on their seafood. They ask you for your preference for spice on a scale of 1 to 10 and I asked for 5. I like to think I'm pretty tolerant against heat and I thought the 5 was perfect. I can't imagine getting an 8 (what my next door customer got). Last comment: I really enjoyed watching the staff interacting with each other. They looked like one big family!",

(Parking is free) the restaurant is relatively small but with a cool bar large circular type bar where you can see your food being finished off.  I suggest eating at the bar for the full experience.  My friend is a local regular so helped make some suggestions.  3 of us went and started with a (very) large Caesar salad with lump crab meat on top.  I would consider just going back for the salad, but then the meals came out.  We got 2 to share and could hardly finish them (we are 3 avid eaters mind you) We got a gumbo and a creole style dish with mixed seafood in them.  You can designate your heat (spiciness) from 1-10 and I think there is some crazy level higher than that.  If you're a wuss like me you get a 1 and it's still full of delicious flavor.

    "text": "Ate here last night, after looking for some highly rated places.  This came up high, so decided to try with colleague.  Good choice overall.  Ordered Pan roast crawfish and Shrimp Gumbo (there were two of us). They explained spice as 1-10, 3 being tabasco.  We got Pan roast as a 3, Gumbo as an 8. 8 was great, but  I needed more.  They brought me the pepper mix to add to it and that did the trick.    I also want to commend the server for saying that if I go an 8 and it was too hot, I couldn't return it (that's why I got the 8, since I had no relative way to gauge their hotness). Here it is easy to add the heat since that is based on the hot pepper flake mix, you can't remove it.  So pay attention to that and ask for the pepper mix, rather than ruin your meal.  I'd give it a 5 based on service and food quality, but the ambiance was why I gave a 4.   I assumed that the restaurant would be off in a corner behind some walls, with some semblance of ambiance, but that wasn't to be.  I don't like the smokers just around the corner, and so that demeaned the experience.  So with that in mind, if you are at the casino and want a great meal, consider it a 5. Food quality great, service great, so do highly recommend it. The only issue i really have is that it is surrounded by people smoking and on the edge of a loud casino situation. The small menu (better word is focused, this is a positive thing here) is fine, and the food was really quite good.    Other reviews saying one dish can serve two are correct, the portions are quite large, so fact that in when looking at prices, really can serve two with one dish depending on appetite of your party.  I did finish my dish myself, but I am a glutton ;-)",

Selections include gumbo, pan roasts (a tomato-based broth with chunks of seafood), or seafood creole all with your choice of shrimp, crab, chicken, crawfish, oysters, or all five, with rice. They also have fresh oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktails, salads, and tasty seafood chowder, as well as the occasional lobster special. I've been probably 20 times and still never had a bad dish. The staff is friendly and helpful, and will adjust the spiciness of the dishes to your taste. By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort.  As another reviewer noted, this restaurant is really just a bar with a couple of tables, stuck right off the casino floor. This is definitely not a fine dining spot, with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away. Still, it's definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick. At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings, and $25 for a massive platter of oysters, shrimp, crab, mussels, and clams, it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food.  Good, reasonably priced seafood can be hard to come by in the valley, but this spot is a gem.",

Both delicious at a spice level 7 (bring it!  Perfectly spicy but I could still taste the flavors.). Each is big enough to share or pack up for leftovers for the next day. It's so fun to watch Tipp, the head chef, work her ninja magic on all of the hot pots in front of you. If you're nice and talk to her, she'll give you samples of things she's cooking up for other people that you might want to try next time.  Then, finish the evening with listening to the live band at the nearby circular bar.  :-)",

    "text": "This is by far the best bang for your buck without sacrificing quality in this Valley when it comes to Oysters and Chowder.  I have eaten at the place on at least 5 seperate occasions. It reminds me of a scaled down version of the wonderful Oyster bars that you might find at some of the Las Vegas Casino's, with the addition of some other tasty seafood boils, and cajun concoctions.  First off, the Oysters on the Half Shell are reasonably priced, as fresh as I have had here in the Valley, and everytime that I have ordered them, they have been consistently fresh. I'm not sure that type of Oysters they serve off the top of my head, but they are great!  As for the Clam and Corn Chowder, they are both amazing for the Valley of the Sun! The clam chowder has a great consistency, and does not have that taste of fishy, canned clams. The flavors of the other ingredients are apparent, and the clams are just a nice tender, mild piece of meat that makes a nice filler for the soup. The Oyster crackers that they garnish the chowder with are actually seasoned, and are very tasty.  The Shrimp boil is another favorite dish. They boil the shrimp in a Citrus, Lobster Stock and finish it with a Tomato Cream sauce. They serve most dishes with crusty sliced bread so you can soak up and enjoy the juices of the dishes.  The only thing that I am not a huge fan of, was the crab salad slider. I'm not going to knock the rating down, as everyone else loved them, and the presentation was great. I think that it just wasn't what I was looking to have at the time.  When you visit, you will most likely have the pleasure of a very nice woman of asian descent cooking your food directly over the bar in front of you. She goes by the name of Tip, which looks as if it's the first three letters of her extremely long first name on her name tag. You will quickly notice that she puts a large amount of love into her food preparation. Chat with her, she is a sweetheart, and deserves compliments on her work. Tip her out on the side if you care to, as the tips are only pooled by the servers at this restaurant.   The manager, Frank deserves a couple of bucks for seating you and taking your order, but in my opinion the one who prepares the meal should get the majority of the reward for the culinary experience that they provide, but that's just my opinion. :)  Frank is an East Coast guy with a stratight face and $500 haircut, but trust me, he does have a sense of humor, give him a hard time..lol  One last thing, and I will cut this short. The specials that they served on Easter and Fathers Day, consisted of a one and a half pound lobster with claws, caesar salad, and red velvet cake for around $30.  If you decide to order the Collard Greens, make sure that Tip is working because she prepares them proper, with bits of swine for flavor, as well as a bit of vinegar. It may not sound so great to the untrained tongue, so I suggest you give them a shot and teach your tongue a lesson.  Cheers! :)",

There are only three tables and seats at the bar, but the small space serves great Cajun at whatever spice level you like (3 is Tabasco, 10 is ghost peppers). The crawfish etouffee is served with shrimp, crab or combo. It is the closest to New Orleans I have eaten. I have had the Louisiana Gumbo with crab - outstanding. Add the warm ciabatta rolls, and it doesn't get much better. Visit the Ocean Trail Restaurant at TSR and you won't be disappointed.",

I never would have found out about Ocean Trail had it not been for a friend's suggestion.  I'm not a huge fan of Cajun food but this place has amazing Creole.  I ordered a 10 hot and was pleasantly surprised that they actually made it spicy.  I think some places hold back punches when they see a blonde haired white boy order something spicy, but not here.  It is located near the casino floor so that makes for a weird experience if you are just going to eat.  And the beer selection is limited, but the oyster shooters compensate.  Speaking of oysters, you can get 1/2 dozen for $9 which seems like a good deal.  I think the gamblers subsidize the difference with their losses.  I've also heard that the chefs are from the east coast and have some notable seafood certifications (not sure what they are but I can certify they make some mean cajun food chock full of sea critters).",

The service is excellent and all of the staff are welcoming, attentive, and seemed truly pleased to be able to assist you.

Since it's been so long since we last came, he decided on Ocean Trail.   Showed up on a Thursday night around 8:00 at night. Since there are only a few tables and I believe 18 seats around the bar, we were a little worried that we would have to wait in line to get in but there wasn't much of a wait. They had to clean up a spot but there were seats available for us and probably 8 other seats available.   Started our meal with the crab meat cocktail ($20) and it was essentially a martini glass with crab meat with a side of remoulade and cocktail sauce. It was a yummy start since I'm a huge fan of crab.   Brian and I both ordered the pan roast combo (crawfish, crab and shrimp) but he got his without crawfish. I chose the spicy level of 3, which is medium, and he got 6 again. Seriously, I don't know how he enjoyed it so much because I felt like mine was pretty hot for medium. Both of us had dirty rice with our meals and of course, I ordered an extra side of rice - it's the Asian in me     There is also complimentary rolls that we dipped in our meals. This was my cheat meal for the week so one roll for me and the rest for my boyfriend... The both of us took at least half of our meals home too! I know some people don't like reheating seafood but it's so good! Can't let it go to waste and it's honestly still good after reheating it.   I asked if they did anything for birthdays and they brought out a slice of chocolate cake with a candle. It was perfect for my sweet tooth even though it's not my birthday. He doesn't usually care for sweets but he had at least 3 bites - which is a lot for him.   To top off the birthday boy's evening, he won some money in the casino so it was a successful evening!",

My husband and I were a bit hesitant as we have never tried this type of cuisine before but we decided to go and give it a shot.   We started with the mussels which were just ok. I've had better honestly. For our main entree I got the pan roast crab meat and the others got shrimp and combos. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the food! Also, the portion sizes are HUGE! You could easily split a meal between two people. We ranged from level 3 to a level 6 in the spice range and even the 3 gave me the sniffles. I like spicy and this was a perfect amount of spice for me. Any higher and I would have been sweating.   The only downside to this restaurant is how small it is.  I believe there are only about 5 tables and then seating around the bar.  They don't take reservations and if it's busy, you have to wait in a line down the hall for people to finish their meals.  Other than that, I highly recommend!",

I never would have gone here if I wasn't going to be at the casino for another event, but I'm glad I did.  I ordered the mixed seafood boil, and it was outstanding ($18, and surprisingly, worth every penny).  Just a ton of seafood in a rich sauce that I had to clean up with a ton of their excellent bread.  They ask you to order on a 1-10 scale.  My mother likes a little spice but tried the 3 and said it was almost too hot.  I order a medium to medium hot in a Thai restaurant, and got a 6, and I was sweating and it was at the edge of my comfort zone.  So be forwarned... it's spicy.  My father, however, ordered a 9, and said it was spicy but not as spicy as he wants.  He orders Thai hot usually.    I shared an order of the clams, which were tasty but perhaps a bit expensive at nearly $15.  I saw numerous shrimp cocktails, which looked gigantic and tasty, but didn't see the price or try it.  If not too unreasonable, it looked like 5 gigantic prawns, so a substantial appetizer.  Anyway, I'll be back.  Which is surprising, because I usually hate to step foot in a casino.  But it's just an outstanding, unusual meal.  Give it a try if you love seafood and creole cooking.",

The dirty rice was nothing more than a tasteless mass of brown rice with specks of meat.   If you've ever eaten Cajun food from the south  then you will not have the slightest appreciation for cooking here. The jumbo shrimp cocktail was delicious but how can you mess that up?",

It is more of a walk-up eating area than a restaurant; but, don't let that stop you.  This place has the best seafood gumbo this side of New Orleans.  I love it.  I go there at least once a quarter and make excuses to justify going there because I am not a gambler.    There are other really great items on the menu, i.e., the lump crab cocktail and the cajun style shrimp boil, too.  The star attraction is the combo LOUISIANA GUMBO  You can dial in your heat between a 1 (low) and 10( hot).  And order over dirty rice or white rice.  I go with a 7 and dirty rice and with a little fresh warm bread, I am dipping, slurping, and well fed patron. Give it a try.    Afterwards, saunter over to the Shadows Lounge for a post meal cocktail and cigar.  A great evening!!",

Oysters and shrimp cocktail are also some of the best I have ever had. This is a very small restaurant but worth the wait. I like sitting at the oyster bar and watching them make all the dishes. The red beans and rice are just as good as I had in New Orleans! The only dish I haven't tried is the gumbo and that is up next on the list for me. They let you pick the spiciness of the dishes you order. I get a 4 which is a little hotter than tobasco sauce which is how they explain the levels to you. 3 is tobasco. Service is really good. Prices are very reasonable for seafood and the portions which are huge. I always have some to take home which I just make some rice and have a whole other meal!",

I must admit the oysters weren't as briny as I like them but they were still good and hella huge. The table bread and butter were a nice touch but the star of the evening was the gumbo and dirty rice! I got the combo with everything at a level five heat and couldn't have been more pleased. It's so fun to watch your pan roast/gumbo get made freshly just for you. Don't forget to order a cocktail too, my hurricane was only $7.50 you can't beat that! Bonus tip: it's surprisingly slow on Sunday afternoons :-)",

    "text": "Rule 1 - don't eat seafood at a casino.  Exceptions - unless you are at Palace Station in LV or Ocean Trails in Scottsdale!  I have previously reviewed Palace Station so let's focus on Ocean Trail.   Business has forced me to many Native Nation destinations. The rule of thumb is eat elsewhere. OT is a notable exception. It's late. I'm tired and just couldn't make it to Old Town, so I gave OT a try.   Rule 2 - if you can smell the fish, don't eat there!  Neptune in Boston and Blue Point in San Diego are perfect examples of this rule. You walk in and smell the sea, not the fish.   OT is tucked into a small corner of the Talking Stick Resort. Smoking is allowed in the casino. Yes , there is noise. Despite the setting, OT is fresh, clean and spotless without being sterile.   Rule 3 -  the oracle of Cajun, Jeff Cook of Gris Gris in NOLA, taught me \"start with the jambalaya or ettouffee. If they don't get it right walk out.\"  I put the lesson to the test ordering ettouffee and collards.   Mud bugs are fresh - not frozen. The base is a six hour process. Collards are the perfect ratio of wet/fat/mix. The sausage is ordered direct from Baton Rouge.  That sums it up. OT grossly exceeded my expectations. Out of 100 meals 20 get 1 star and a notice to avoid. 65 get no review - I expect really good.  10 get 4 stars. Switch your plans to go there. And five get five stars. These are the unexpected gems that would be missed without the endorsement of some obsessed clown like me.   It's \"Ocean Trail\"  I guarantee it!!!",

    "text": "Ocean Trail is one of those weird little gems you discover by accident.  The Creole restaurant sits on the casino floor at Talking Stick Resort in Scottsdale (ok, well technically, it's on the reservation).  Despite its location among the slots, you can carry on a normal conversation (except when somebody hits big) and unless you are extremely sensitive to cigarette smoke, the atmosphere is pleasant.  I've been to OT a few times and while not perfect, you can expect delicious food, efficient service, and a lively experience.  One of the reasons I left off a star was that our dinner last night had a couple of misses.  First, the Blue Point Oysters on the half shell were served with almost no liquor.  Based upon how fast they came out, I suspect they had been shucked some time before they were served.  They weren't awful but they also didn't light us up.  Second, my wife's Cajun Style Shrimp Boil (served in a watery mildly flavored broth) was utterly boring and the shrimp were a bit overcooked.  Not unpalatable but well beneath our previous experiences.  Fortunately, my Seafood Combo Etouffee saved the day.  I ordered it with the dirty rice.  We basically dumped my wife's shrimp into my Etouffee and shoveled the result into our face (I know, bad visual but honest).  You can tell a good etouffee by the color. Bright orange (at least in my book) is a no no.  I love when the base is almost a milk chocolate brown and OT didn't disappoint. They also hit the spice level out of the park at my requested 5 out of ten.  Enough heat to make you blow your nose (yet another lousy visual) but not so much that you lost any of the flavor.  You could taste the complexity of the roux and the seafood stock.  Plus, it was absolutely loaded with seafood (shrimp, crawfish, and crab).  While not perfect last night, I would still highly recommend Ocean Trail.  Go early to avoid the line (no reservations) and then see a show, play some blackjack, or hang out at the nearby bar and dance floor.  You'll have a great time and a fully belly.",

The white rice made up what was lacking in the dirty rice. The gumbo with a choice of 5 level spice was delicious. My coworker had Caesar salad and another companion had the chowder and red beans and rice. I tried the red beans and rice and not quite impressed.  I'm compelled to return, because maybe it was an off day for the dirty rice.  If the service wasn't so good, I would have downgraded the rating.",

We asked the chef what her favorite dish was and she pointed to a pan of seafood creole she was cooking up and let us sample some.  We'll definitely come back for that dish too.

You've gotta love the fact that their soups are cooked right there in front of you. It really elevates the experience and gives you a great show!

I have been smelling the delicious seafood smell throughout the Talking Stick Casino forever but never ventured to try Ocean Trail because I don't like eating alone.  But today I broke the rule.

I was presented with two, warm delicious rolls with butter.  This was good bread.  Many, many places give you something they call bread and it is awful.  This was really nice.   The bowl of soup was small for $8 but I will tell you this:  It had plenty of fresh clams and the taste and texture was amazingly good.  Even the mini oyster  crackers were great tasting and super crunchy.   They have a lunch special during certain hours where you can get soup and salad for about $11.  I am down for that.  Real soon. To the management:  Will you FILL the bowl to the top next time.  I got half a bowl but didn't want to make a fuss on my first visit.  But next time, I will complain.",

    "text": "Yummy, yum, yum!  This place makes me happy that I do not have seafood allergies.  I came here last night after doing some Yelp research.  I was originally going to try one of the crab in a bag type of places (I've never done this before and I felt like getting a little messy).  After reading reviews that the food tasted frozen I took a hard pass.    Hubby wanted to gamble and I wanted to eat.  Perfect marriage by going to Talking Stick, just like me and my husband.  :)   Everything was super fresh and delicious.  The spice in my husband's gumbo was perfect at a 6.  We shared the mussels to start and they were yummy too.  I had a Cesar salad that seemed to be growing more lettuce babies as I ate it.  It took me forever and I was basically full by the time I got my seafood chowder.  I had a couple of bites of the chowder before I asked to take it to go.   Now, it's early in the morning and Chowder Time!  This is so good!  My only complaint is that I've found tiny pieces of shell or skin from the sea creatures.  I four them last night as well.  I hate having to search my mouth to find this stuff.  Also, my salad was extremely cold. I watched them make a few of them after I got mine and it looks like they throw it into a blast chiller before serving it.  Next time I'm going to ask them to skip that step.  I prefer something closer to room temp for my salads.   I had a glass of prosecco and my husband had a mule made with Hendricks Gin.  We live in Nevada and are aware that the price for a mile with top shelf alcohol there would have been probably double the cost.  My wine was only a little over six dollars.  It was a generous pour too.    The service was great.  The person that took our order was fine. The lady that makes all of the food asked us how we were doing (we sat at the bar).  Another gentleman came by often to check on us and he bagged my food for me.  All-in-all this was a nice experience.",

It is loaded with shrimp, clams, scallops, crab and rice in a creole sauce and is served with fresh, warm rolls. It truly brings back memories of New Orleans. My friends had never been here or tasted such a delightful seafood creole dish in AZ. The casino was packed for New Years day. The noise level was up but not to the level you couldn't talk. The smell of cigarette smoke was in the air but not to the level of burning your eyes and throat as in some other casinos. They did some renovations a couple of months ago. The place was very clean and appeared to be very well managed. If you want to try something different and love seafood, I highly recommend this cafe in the casino. It is worth the trip.",

Not bad for a bar type atmosphere :-) We started off with a Cajun Style Shrimp Boil Appetizer. Very good! Tipp, our Chef of the night was kind enough to provide samples of the different sauces and soups they served since it was our first time. She was awesome and the samples of soups and sauces were awesome. Trying the samples helped in making our decision. We ended up getting 3 dishes among 4 of us and they were very hearty. they gave us an option of heat (spiciness on a rating of 1 to 10) and we opted for 5 on all 3 of our dishes. We selected the Combo Etouffee (with shrimp and crabmeat)  and the sauce was a spicy rich tomato sauce flavor. We also selected the Seafood Creole which had shrimp, clams, scallops and crab with a nice creole sauce. Our final selection was the Louisiana Gumbo and we decided to have crawfish from a selection of Chicken, Crawfish, oyster, shrimp, crabmeat or a combo. We had them serve it up with Dirty Rice from a selection of either Dirty Rice or regular White Rice. It was ALL AWESOME. I would rank it right up there with Pappadeaux's if not better :-)",

Promised my hubby this would be worth it. I did everything to put those poor little shrimps and crabs under pressure to perform. Did they? Hell, yeah!  The shrimp and lump crab pan roast will be one of those perfect dishes in the valley for me. The sort you can go back for and know you will stop talking, tuck your phone inside, stop making eye contact with people around you until you dunk the last piece of bread into the delicious lobster broth. Absolute kiss the cook stuff! (and, the adorable hardworking Asian chef only adds to that temptation)",

The pan roast combo is the way to go, it was one of the best things we've ever had. Take note that one order was more than enough for the two of us to share, and I'm not a small man.  Although there isn't much seating, they get people through there in short order. It is so worth the wait.",

We go to Talking Stick a lot but it wasn't until I read in the Best of Phoenix last year that this was voted \"Best Seafood\" that we even thought to check it out. I thought that was kind of funny/interesting/odd that the best seafood in Phoenix was in the casino and therefore was very intrigued. The combo gumbo is soooooooooooooo good. Sausage, shrimp, okra, chicken, crawfish, oysters, etc. Get it with dirty rice. One order of this is more than enough for two people to share and still have leftovers. BUT it's so good you may consider getting your own order. We like to order it pretty spicy but you can get it really mild too. Best thing to get to drink with it is a Drifter beer. YUM. Writing this review is making me want to go there right now.   Also, do not go expecting some fancy pants atmosphere. You WILL be 10 feet away from gamblers...and slot machines...you are at a casino.",

So I was excited about trying it because I go to Vegas about 3-5x a year and go to the Oyster Bar everytime where Bob prepares my food spice level 10.   So my husband and I go and to Ocean Trail the set up I say is more glamorous than my delicious Oyster Bar. We went on a Saturday night so it was a little busy and too many staff members walking around and the waiter was never available when you needed him at the oyster bar there is the cook, server and a cleaner simple.  So it was a bit confusing.   I ordered a hurricane it was too sweet and no liquor.  He ordered a long island just ok.  We ordered half dozen oysters and combination gumbo spicy 8. There was a guy telling me it is too spicy to get a 10. The waiter said this is a lot spicier than the Oyster Bar so I believed them and got the 8.   The oysters were dirty and small. The rolls and butter were delicious.  The gumbo wasnot spspicy at all like eating baby food. So I ordered some ghost pepper \"stuff\" on the side and you have to sprinkle it to make it hotter with dirty rice. It was an ok date night.  I will go back and try it again.",

It's not what you think, it's located on the main floor of the casino in kind of a circular kiosk. It seats about 20.  We decided on the steamed mussels and combination gumbo. The mussels was in a wine and garlic broth. The mussels were large and fresh. Drank all the broth. Followed up with the combo gumbo with medium heat. Portions was huge. Easy enough for two people. Great taste. Coming from seafood area I have to admit this was top three stuff. Our Chef Tipp and her staff was great and I will make sure I come back again...like tomorrow.",

When you walk up to Ocean Trial the first time it is almost confusing and a little awkward as it is very small place and on the Casino floor directly behind everyone gambling. If you go on the weekends you will wait standing in a roped off line to the side, but it is worth the interesting atmosphere and the wait.  If you are not sure what to get, I must say that the pan roast is hands down the best dish ever, but the crab cocktail and the shrimp boil are also amazing. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. That being said, we did not enjoy the muscles. However, this would be the only thing on the entire menu I wouldn't recommend.

    "text": "The pan roast is one of the best dishes in all of Phoenix.  Whether you order the combo, crawfish, or shrimp, each dish is packed with seafood and satisfies the belly like nothing else.  You still remember that you're eating in a casino, 'cause you really can't drown out the sounds from the slot machines or stop smelling the cigarette smoke wafting your way from all angles, but it doesn't matter, because the food is JUST THAT GOOD.  If you're sitting at one of the small tables away from the bar, it's also hard to ignore the mass of people that are constantly walking by you, since you're right off the casino floor, but don't let that deter you from eating here either.  The food is JUST THAT GOOD!  If you like okra, then you'll love the gumbo, which is also packed with fresh seafood-y goodness and okra-y sliminess.  The shrimp boil is not bad, and would be good on its own, but not when compared to any of the pan roast dishes.  The broth is a little too thin for my taste.  The chowders are excellent, as is the Caesar salad.    But the thing that ties the whole thing together is their bread, which is kind of toasty and soft and chewy all at the same time, and which is perfect for extracting every last bite of sauce and crab bits from the last remnants of your pan roast.  Great bread + great butter + great pan roast = awesome meal every time.  And at only $12 for lunch, or $20 for dinner (for double the portion), I personally think that this meal is a steal.    Sit at the bar and watch the whole cooking process take place, and prepare to be amazed.",

If you don't want to wait, go there at 10pm or later.  I have tried so many raw oysters at different restaurants in town, but nothing like ocean trail's.  I am glad they are far away from me, otherwise I would be visiting too often.",

I was greeted quickly and brought a menu and water over.  After seeing some of my neighbors dishes, it was an easy choice for me:  I ordered the combo pan roast.  The server asked me how spicy I wanted the dish....they use a scale of 1-10!!  So that makes it kind of hard to decide...so I just went for a 7.  Chose dirty rice!  Spicy & Dirty!  The dish was huge!  It was loaded with all kinds of goodies...plenty of shrimp to make anyone happy.  BTW...a 7 is not that spicy.  I had to add a little more spice from the sauces they have at the ready.  Along with a nice glass of white wine, this is an almost perfect meal.  Definitely coming back.",

Picture one bar and 5/7 tables around it. Yeah that small.   The wait staff makes up for it as they were very sweet and pleasant. I was that annoying brat that needed her phone charged. And they took it from me and had one of their cooks charge it. Thus why I have no pictures sorry yelpers!   The clam chowder wasn't as marvelous as Boston or San Francisco but still good consider you are in a land lock state.   All in all try it if you are in the area and if you are their around opening time so you can grab a seat without the wait.",

Be sure to get the red beans and rice. Really special. From the comments by other yelpers we ordered the pan roasted combo: combo of shrimp crawfish and scallops  so good! And a huge portion,  2 people can share this with a side of red beans and rice. Sit in the back facing the casino floor and it is much quieter and offers a interesting view   the service is super fast and you can watch them preparing the food.  We simply loved it and can't wait to go back!!",

Why else would you go to an old dumpy, off the strip casino like Palace Station?!  The place is tiny with very limited seating and long waits when it gets busy, but it's all worth it.    To my surprise, the Pan roast at Ocean Trail is absolutely comparable to the one in Vegas and now that's one less place I absolutely have to stop by when I go to Vegas!    Pro-Tip:  You love crab?  I mean REALLY love crab?  like a MOUTHFUL of crab?  don't order the freakin combo.  That shrimp and other stuff will break up the crab texture!  Get the CRAB panroast!  enjoy the gobs and gobs of crabby goodness!!  I spent years getting the combo until someone suggested to just get crab.  changed my life!  You get more crab in place of all that other stuff, which is still good and all.... but,,,, CRAB!",

Both times we came our tummies left happy.  Can only eat at the bar if you are 21 and over.  We've had the panroast, clam chowder, oysters, seafood corn chowder.  Clam chowder- this was decent.. but I honestly think most clam chowders taste the same   Oysters- Being a California native I felt this could be fresher but with no bodies of water around Arizona .. this is probably as good as it gets.  The oyster meat was HUGE, big plus.   Seafood corn chowder- I would opt for this over the clam chowder, creamy yet every bite was filled with seafood.  Perfectly seasoned !  Panroast-  I saved the best for last! This was AMAZING.  Perfect taste for those who like tomato based dishes.  I got mine with crawfish and my boyfriend got his with crab.  Both were good, the crawfish was lighter and crab was denser.  The second time we came we got the combination which I liked a lot better.  This is a MUST TRY!  So far the best panroast/seafood I have eaten in Arizona.",

Had expected to sit at the counter since there were just the two of us, but our server Jaime actually asked us if we'd prefer sitting at the next available table, which was a four-top, when there was space at the counter to seat two!  Why, of course!  And I thought since we were taking up more space than we needed, I invited a guest we'd been chatting w/ at the line to come join us!  The more, the merrier, right?    We had a great time conversing w/ our new friend (I actually was already acquainted w/ the guest, but  she made for a fun new dinner companion for my friend, too), as she had the 5-shrimp cocktail ($13.95, and the shrimp were almost the size of prawns!) and wine, while the two of us had small bowls of NE clam chowder ($5 each) and bread w/ glasses of wine.  (Pinot grigio and cab for $5.50 each?  Oh yeah!)  Next time, I'm getting a large bowl ($8) of that chowder... so tasty!  Great tip:  You can order your drinks here and take them up to Degree 270 (or anywhere, except out of the casino, for that matter!  Hmm... I wonder if you can take them up to your room??) and chill out up there!",

One thing to remember, their food is fricken HOT!!! They ask you scale of 0-10 how hot you like it. I had the gumbo at 7 and was sweating and my nose was running like a faucet. So the next time I went down to a 5, and it was still bringing the major heat. And I like spice...

Chef Tipp and her crew are truly outstanding: friendly, helpful, entertaining, personable...and the food! As good as anything I've had in Nawlins. While we've tried (and thoroughly enjoyed) just about everything on the menu, these days we almost always start with the steamed clams (which we always finish) and then the shrimp gumbo (half of which we end up taking home). And the greens...don't forget Tipp's greens!",

    "text": "If casinos are all about gambling and the uncertainly that goes along with it, then it's nice to know that you'll be well fed with certainty at Ocean Trail, a small-ish restaurant on the outer bounds of the Talking Stick Casino floor.  Lady luck isn't always generous, but Ocean Trail makes up for it with eye popping portions  A jumbo sized martini glass of lump crab cocktail ($16) is a meal in itself, and relatively fresh (although you'll get a few bits of shell every once in a while).     Gumbo ($13.75 - $19.25) is served in a porcelain swimming pool, topped with a small island of rice (your choice of white or dirty).  Although it's not the best gumbo I've ever tasted, lacking the depth of a good dark roux and absent any notes of file, it's deeply filling, savory and comforting, especially after you've lost your shirt in 3-card poker.    And if you've room after a massive bowl of gumbo, wiped clean with the hot and crusty complimentary rolls, you shouldn't miss the smoky and earthy collard greens ($2.50), spiked with any one of the many hot sauces that are always within reach (Crystals, Tobasco, and Louisiana Hot Sauce among others).  Just as the well seasoned gambler thrives on the thrill and uncertainty of the game the well seasoned gourmand thrives on the comfort and certainty of a good and hearty meal.",

The setting wasn't what I imagined; it's in a corner along the casino, strung off with those fancy VIP ropes.   We ordered oysters, clam chowder, clams in a beer/white wine broth, and some cocktails. The oysters had such a clean taste and my guests raved about the clam chowder. The clams had too much of a beer taste for my liking, but I drink very little - everyone else loved it. Service was great as well.   Would definitely come again.",

The pan roast here is exactly what it should taste like and you're in phx! What?! If you like it super spicy, go ahead and ask them to crank it up to, but if you just want a tiny dab of spice then ask them to be nice. Not only is the food good, but their staff is friendly as well. Be respectful if they're busy and they'll treat you even better.  A must for those who enjoy pan roast.",

It's more like a bar, but the FOOD is EXCELLENT!  I always try to get the lunch portion of pan roast seafood at a heat level of 7.  Incredibly spicy and good.  My friend had the gumbo and she said it was the best she's had in a restaurant, compared to hers, and she is a 5-star chef.  Overall, I HIGHLY recommend you try Ocean Trail the next time you're in Scottsdale.  Easy to find and get too.",

It's really just a tiny little corner of the casino with a bar arrangement and about half a dozen tables around it.  It is really tiny.  So during meal times it takes forever just to get seated, and the services is pretty slow even after that.  On the other hand, the food quality is simply fantastic.  The crab/shrimp cocktails are big and the quality of the product is great.  All of the dinner dishes are generously-sized and very good.  You simply won't leave here hungry, or disappointed in the flavors.  For those who don't like \"cajun\" style foods, there are plenty of seafood items that are plain and simple.  The crab cocktail, for example, is served with a tasty but mild creamy remoulade.  There are a number of other non-spicy options available.",
