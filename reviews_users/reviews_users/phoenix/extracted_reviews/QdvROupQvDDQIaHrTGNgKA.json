    "text": "After telling our friends about how awesome the Asian market was, they wanted to check out some of the restaurants. Every restaurant I've been to near an Asian market is fantastic and this is no exception.   When we entered the place was packed which is always nice to see. The menu was huge which normally I don't like but this place has a great reason behind it - they offer traditional Chinese and Americanized dishes as well and they separate it on the menu too.  We leaned more towards the American side since it was our first time. The pork fried rice was killer -the tables favorite. The chow mein was next in line and we got just the veggie version. We had some steamed buns that were probably closer to dumplings than buns, but of course those were fantastic as well. We had some chicken dishes too that were awesome but I can't remember what we had (which is probably a good thing so  I make sure I get some of the traditional dishes next time).  Because I am not as familiar with some of the dishes, I asked a lot of questions of both the servers and the people surrounding us. I mean how else are you supposed to find out whats good if you don't ask and the right people to ask are the Chinese (I hope that doesn't come off as offensive because I do not mean it that way at all!).  For four people the meal was extremely reasonable and we got a free egg roll with our check in offer.  Next time I go, I am going to ask more questions and pretty much have someone order me something delicious and traditional so I can try new things and learn more about the food and culture. Can't wait to go back.",

I asked her since we have 5 people if we can get a bigger table, because we were given a 4 people table, she replied with very rude attitude & without checking, she immediately say \"NO\" and walks away!When our food was served to us by another waiter, this waitress was so kind and said \"I need to move you all to a bigger table because you all won't fit in here\".  I thank her for doing this and I told her what happened earlier and she apologized for her rude co-worker.  Later when we asked the same rude fat waiter again that we will need few Togo boxes, she say \"WAIT\" and walked away by now I am already so angry at her.  We were not given the boxes after 4 minutes later!!  WTF!  She walks by our table few times and looked at us few times and don't even care!  What pissed me off even more is When my husband was at the desk paying the bill, the FAT waiter walked passed our table and mumbles \"the bill does not include tips, so please pay tips\"!  I mean. WTF!!  We read the bill and knows about it! I was getting ready to tip them $15, since she is such a rude BxxxH, I took back my $10 and leave the $5 for the other NICE WAITER.  I hope the nicer one will get it.",

We got our soup, but no bowls or spoons. The entrees came all at different times, but with no silverware or chopsticks or plates for the meal. Forget more water or refills. The chicken fried rice was greasy and the spicy food had no spice at all- not even salt or pepper. Give this place a pass.",

Almond Chicken is servicable... just skip noticing that they use peanuts instead of almonds and that there is barely 3 oz of chicken.  Rice was a tad dry.  Meh...",

We ordered our food and 5 minutes later we had all four dishes in front of us (fresh and not pre-made).  My personal favorite is Szechwan chicken.  However, everything we had was great.  The food is very good quality Chinese food and it isn't overly greasy.  I love Chinese food, but it doesn't always love me back (if you know what i mean)!   The ambiance is very nice and the noise level is very tolerable.   When you check-in using the yelp app it says you will receive a free dessert - but they don't honor it for some reason.",

We kinda wandered our way into the Chinese Cultural Center on a lazy Sunday afternoon, I needed to pick up a couple of things from the market, and have been craving some genuinely delicious Chinese food (I was experiencing bad nerves exacerbated by systemic and repeated bouts of disappointment with my takeout and delivery options)...  ANYWHO...we got allllllll sorts of kerfluffled and twitterpated when we saw they had a dim sum section on the menu...not very many dim sum options, but all of them sounded pretty good to me (plus it was the first time I actually SAW a dim sum menu, usually I just see folks wandering around with carts of unknown treasures and delights...no carts on the day we went there though).     The menu itself is GIGANTIC, HUGE, COLOSSAL (ok, not in a Cheesecake Factory way, but definitely more than you'll find at a hole-in-the-wall quick order-by-numbers place (ie #1 w/ chicken and #27 w/ shrimp)) ... and is broken down into Americanized and non. I love that. It gives me an opportunity to get something that I'm familiar with AND try some more risque items that I can't get from Panda Express. ;)   So here's the dish:  ***Wonton in Spicy & Sour Sauce (dim sum) - Heavenly ****Dumpling in Chili Sauce (dim sum) - Even better than the wontons **Dan Dan Noodle (dim sum) - it was ok, but the other two were way better *****Sauteed Green Bean - PHENOMENAL and second only to... *****Yuxiang Eggplant (this was so good that if someone told me I had to eat this eggplant and those green beans every day for the rest of my life, I would thank them...and maybe offer my eternal gratitude).   All of that came to about $30, we were stuffed and had leftovers for my lunch the next day.  Also, I went to their website (just now) and it looks like you can order takeout (Phoenix) or takeout AND delivery (Chandler) from them online.   SOLID!!!",

This is the sort of Chinese restaurant that shows its contempt for Americanized Chinese food by cooking it badly (and very possibly by just dumping pre-fab food from Sysco into the wok, as my fried rice looked remarkably like the fried rice I'd bought in a bag at Winco last year).  My logic in trying an entree that wasn't wildly challenging was that $12.95 is a lot to risk on a complete unknown -- but if I tried something somewhat familiar and liked it, then I'd feel confidence in branching out into more challenging dishes next time, and could thus gradually expand my horizons. (This is after determining that genuine Chinese dishes I'd had elsewhere weren't available, possibly because my faves are not Szechwan. I did try. I rather wanted certain oyster or hot-pot dishes of yore.)  Nope. There are two customers in Szechwan Palace's world: those who know and love authentic Chinese food with ingredients that do not usually appear in American cooking, and those who are so dead to taste and cuisine that they will be happy with food-service diced veg in their fried rice. No middle ground will be offered.",

The flavor of the cumin and chili go so amazingly together. It was the most tender beef I've ever had. I ordered their rice noodle in brown sauce which the noodles and beef were also cooked to perfection! I did think that it was a little oily but the flavors were out of this world.   For the service they were so nice to explain and suggest items. They aren't the friendliest, they are just to the point and they get everything very very quick (which I prefer). You go there for the food, not the dining experience. The interior is very beautiful. They were INSANELY quick in the kitchen. I was beyond impressed. I love the way they serve family style and they give you a whole pot of white rice.   I will be coming back for sure!!",

The woman at the front desk taking the time orders of the people behind me while I'm standing directly in front of her should have been a deterrent. Unfortunately, I'm persistent.   I got my lunch order to go and dove right in when I got back to my desk. It was already after 2 so I would have eaten anything. Well, I couldn't eat the lunch I got from here. I'm not sure why the chicken special tasted like shrimp or why there was literally frozen broccoli in it but it tasted horrible and was pretty inedible. I got 5 bites in before I gave up. Even the egg roll was disgusting and I'll eat anything fried.   I wish I could get a refund but to ask for such a thing would require me to talk to people that shouldn't be in the service industry.",

Both of these friends proclaim the restaurant as very authentic and I agree, having visited China at least a dozen times.  The food is tasty - I've eaten boiled chicken, kung pao chicken, pork noodle soup, pork dumplings, vinegar cucumber and sauteed garlic green beans.  All delicious although I have a feeling I was eating a lot of calories.    So if you desire authentic Chinese food such as you would get in Shanghai or Beijing, try this place.  It's in the Chinese Cultural Center.",

The other dish which was recommended as their favorite and is supposed to be spicy came out and it was god awful. It was Water boiled spicy beef.  We told the waitress it was unedible. It was barely spicy and had something in it that numbs your tongue and tasted like novacane. Our tongues were all numb.  No Offer to exchange it for something else. And certainly they were not about to remove it from the tab.   Bad customer service as far as I'm concerned.   Tip for the owners this is America, not China. Work on your customer service skills",

Soup was nothing special. Egg roll almost flavorless and mushy. No ability to substitute Lo mein for rice. Better like rice. This IS a Chinese restaurant right?   Everything came out on same plate. Cold salad next to hot entree next to hot rice. Most places serve these separately. Obviously a move to save servers work.  Iced tea was basically water.   I didn't notice the menu advice until writing this. Maybe my experience would have been better? Probably the food but I doubt the service. Just a thought, have any of them been to an American restaurant where they give you BOTH menus?  Check was delivered halfway through meal. Thank you very much. You may go now.  Meh",

    "text": "Good Food, Lots of Choices, Overwhelming Menu...  First of all, I have to go back here again. There are so many things I want to try. Eating here did however require that I take considerable time to study the menu, and that I ask lots of questions.   When I was arrived shortly after they opened for lunch, I was seated quickly, and provided a menu and water. From the moment I was seated, every minute or two someone approached me to take my order. I finally explained that this was my first time and that I needed to be left alone for a bit. Mission accomplished. No one else approached until I put the menu down on the table and closed it.  I ordered hot tea, and from their Authentic Szechwan menu, C107 - Spinach in Garlic Sauce and C124 - Yangzhou Style Fried Rice with egg, shrimp, chicken, roasted pork and peas and carrots in a white sauce (not the usual dark colored fried rice).   My food didn't take long to be prepared, and was fresh and satisfying. The Spinach was perfectly seasoned and cooked. A nice mild dish with lots of garlic aroma and flavor in a lovely light sauce. The Yangzhou Style fried rice was not like any other fried rice I have had before, and if I hadn't read the description carefully and seen the picture, I would have been confused by it. The shrimp and the chicken in the dish were particularly delicate, moist and delicious and clearly cooked to order. The roast pork was chopped into roughly 1/4 inch cubes, and the rice was mildly flavored and had a sort of melt in your mouth texture. I needed to add a bit of soy sauce to the dish, along with a small amount of hot oil for bite, but I ate as much of it as I could. The leftovers of both dishes reheated well at home in the microwave (loosely covered).  At no point did I lack for service, with servers constantly checking back with me.  My only disappointment was that I could not try everything I wanted to, including items from the \"Americanized\" menu - such as Egg Foo Yung - which I didn't go for this time because I was a little disappointed that the ingredients (peas, carrots, meat, whatever) are all served over the patties in brown sauce rather than inside of the patties. Only onion and bean sprouts are cooked in the patties. When I go back again, I'm going to go for it and see how I like it. It was also a bit pricey, but now that I've experienced the equality of other menu items, I'll spring for it.  When I finished my meal and pushed my plates away, my check was brought immediately, along with take-out containers for my leftovers. The payment process went quickly, and soon I had my delicious left-overs in my car to smell all the way home.",

We ordered xiao long bao (dumplings with soup inside), water boiled pork, and intestine dry hot pot. the xiao long bao was really good and flavorful, those are always a nice treat. the water boiled pork has a literal tongue numbing effect and I just couldn't enjoy that dish with a numb tongue. I'm not sure what kinda spices but it was spicy and I like that this place can make some spicy, flavorful dishes. the intestines were good but there were so many peppers. overall, good place and we'll probably be back to order from the Americanized menu and stick with that.",

Lots of parking here at the Chinese cultural Center. Nice looking place inside and out.  The Cultural Center is a huge beautiful building. Something that Phoenix really needs. But, it looks as if there is quite a few empty business spots here.  We were seated right away,but it did take a while to get our tea. Very quickly though they brought our soup. It was hot and Sour and was very good. The lunch specials are huge plates and you can choose white rice or Brown. No substitutions on anything ,which is the norm. They dropped off the check and you pay it at the front counter. But 3 people were up there and they were all yelling in Chinese at each other about something. Four patrons were waiting to check out in a line and the were not helping anyone. It was a bit crazy. But, luckily we were not in a hurry. Nice place but, I think I like Mui's in Tempe better. My kung pao was not that spicy for some reason. Still worth a try.Close to the Airport. It is a great location.",

    "text": "Regardless of whether or not you like good service, it is irrefutable that Szchewan Palace serves authentic Szechuan cuisine.   Food: My parents are much more aware of the places to eat Chinese food in the Phoenix area. It is well known among all their friends and themselves that the chef here is one of the more talented chefs in Szechuan cuisine. He knows how to cook and he cooks well. Whether or not you like the food is probably more of a preference for this style of cooking (if you're ordering from the non-Americanized menu). We ordered Xi Long Bao, Fried Fish Fillets in Chili Peppers, Beef Tendon in Spicy Oil and Peppercorns, and Dried Tofu with Pork Slice & Celery. The Beef Tendon in Spicy Oil is what they are famous for and it was good. It is an acquired taste so that dish is not for everyone. The Xi Long Bao wasn't as thick skinned as a previous review had mentioned. They may have changed it since that review.  Service:  I know this place gets a lot of heat for their poor service but our experience was 180 degrees. We were served by at least 3-4 different people and they were all very friendly. It may have been because my parents spoke Chinese or it may have been a different set of expectations. Chinese restaurants, in my experience, vary largely on their service because that's not what you come into a restaurant for - its for the food. If having good service is a critical component of your dining experience, I'd say this may not be the place for you. We did get our food almost within 5 minutes of ordering and our waters were refilled frequently throughout the dinner.",

Unfortunately we are boring white people who were too scared of the unknown dishes so we ordered orange chicken, mongolian beef, general tsao's chicken, crab wontons, beef chow mein, sweet and sour soup, and egg rolls. The soup was great, warm, spicy, big chunks of tofu and pork. Everything else was mediocre at best. The entrees were nothing more than goopy cornstarch sauce with little to-no flavor, the meats and vegetables in everything seemed to be fresh and of good quality but were coated in batter and perhaps just barely fried- leaving them covered in soggy mush that has absorbed the goopy flavorless sauces. Nothing other than the soup was spicy, not even a hint of heat- never-mind the little pepper next to the items on the menu indicating the heat level. It was a giant waste of money and if we hadn't ordered take-out we definitely would have gotten our money back. We've now got a fridge full of left-overs that we're dreading eating. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. I imagine the black menu is tastier, but it's ridiculous to have two menus with food of completely different quality levels rather than levels of authenticity.   Moral of the story: Gross. Flavorless. A gigantic waste of time and money. We're so disappointed.",

    "text": "I won't repeat what has already been said but there has been some myths that need clarifying  1. Both the Chinese and Americanized menus are written in English including the description of the dishes. Also, you can ask the waiter to explain the specials. You don't have to speak Chinese or be Chinese to know the specials. After dining here, I realize some people want to sound unique or VIP but trust me, you don't have to be Chinese to taste all the dishes. That is B.S.  2. The Yelp photos donated by members make the dishes appear larger than they are. Most of the sauteed dishes like the Kung Pao chicken and Egglant were not big but then some like the Water Boil chicken was rather big.  3. The food is spicy but it isn't hot. If I had to compare it to a Thai restaurant, the food is about a 5 on a 10 scale. You will probably need to ask them to make it spicier even if you are not one of those crazy people that have to eat everything hot.   4. They do NOT use reheated rice. I was expecting reheated rice that you typically find at Wongs and other Chinese restaurants. This place had fresh soft and sticky rice. It was great.  5. Don't take the American menu for granted. It's done pretty well and includes mainstream meats like chicken, beef, pork. The Chinese menu has tripe and meats not typically eaten by Americans which is why it's left off the American menu. You will likely use the American menu as your base and then use the Chinese menu to add select items. Bottomline: get both menus  6. The restaurant is not a hole in the wall. It's the opposite. It's the nicest Chinese restaurant I've been to in the valley. Yes it is small but stylish and well lit  7. The restaurant is definitely busy but not stand in line busy. We were immediately seated and we went on a Friday night at peak hour.   8. The service was suprisingly good. Like most great and authentic Chinese restaurants, the service is lousy with the waiters being expressionless and forcing you to order quickly. The servers were Chinese but were very friendly and acted like family. They didn't rush you. Water was refilled quickly  9. Dishes - read what has already been written. This is covered well. I insist on order the the Water Boil dish (includes choice of chicken, beef, fish or shrimp) and ordering it spicy!  10. You don't have to be with a big group, a grad student at ASU or someone who speaks Chinese to enjoy this restaurant. The idea intimidates people because they make it sound as if it's so authentic since it's included in the Chinese Cultural Center but don't be.  My wife and I are not Chinese and it was just the two of us. And we had a great time",

Everything came out great. Although I wish the kung pao eggplant came with more sauce, it is very flavorful and the texture is just right. The hot and sour soup is awesome, not bland like many run of the mill Chinese restaurants around Phoenix. I just wish the rice was better quality, but it's still a great place to get good Szechwan food!",

    "text": "The only reason I put 4 stars instead of 5 was because I didn't go in and sit down and experience the service and atmosphere. Without that, I won't give a restaurant 5 stars; however, the food here was terrific. I'm always looking for new Chinese food restaurants and I'm super stoked I found this one as it's .5 miles from my work. I got lunch to go, ordered the lemon chicken and crab puffs. The chicken was delicious, the rice (I got fried) wasn't too greasy and it came with a salad, your choice of soup, and egg roll. The salad surprised me, but it was pretty mediocre. I got the egg drop soup and while the portion was not as large as other places, they made up for it in quality. They are generous with the eggs and with the veggies that are in there. I love that they don't use green onions too (HATE green onions). The portion sizes are consistent with lunch-sized portions; pretty much what you'd expect. The crab puffs are absolutely delicious. I hate when I get crab puffs somewhere and they don't have crab or the cream cheese is cold OR they put too many onions in them. This place has them down perfectly; not too oniony and the perfect crispiness. It was inexpensive and super tasty; I can't complain.",

    "text": "I think this might be a new Chinese place I need to go back and try some more. First of all, AUTHENTIC Sichuan dishes! Not just in name only! Holy cow! I picked up my parents from the airport and we decided to give this place a try since they were always disappointed at Golden Buddha. What is this? Water boiled XXXX? Last time I had that was visiting family in China! Ordered Water boiled fish and twice cooked pork. I really like the flavoring of the twice cooked pork. I wanted to order the Yu-shan pork but was overruled by parents. Oh well. They didn't want spicy, so the water boiled fish wasn't after the told the waiter not to make it spicy. Guess I'll have to try again. So, definitely more dishes I need to try. For now, I am happy that there's an authentic sichuan food place in Phoenix and not just the lame old American Chinese that are so totally boring. I am so very disappointed that the Shanghai place next to Golden Buddha has changed owner and they no longer have the special Shanghai menu and the quality of the food has gone down the drain.  Update: Tried the water boiled pork. That I thought was pretty good. The meat was nice and tender. The sichuan peppercorn made everything taste lemony to me later on, including the water. I guess that must be the numbing effect people talk about. I also liked the beef with jalapeno pepper. Nice flavor. And I still really like the twice cooked pork.  I think the restaurant would be better served if they got some more comfortable chairs instead of the unpadded straight back wooden wobbly chairs they have now.",

The atmosphere was ok, and the bar looked a bit disorganized.  I ordered the the sesame chicken and egg drop soup.  I asked if I could pay extra for shrimp fried rice but was told no.  I chose the fried rice vs white or brown.  Soup came out first which I found to be very bland and very few pieces of egg in it.  On my 4th spoonful my meal arrived and I was not impressed by the way it looked.  The sesame chicken was only bits of fried chicken in batter covered with very little brown very thick and gooey sweet sauce.  Some of the chicken pieces didn't even have sauce on it and grossed me out because it was hard and bland.  The fried rice looked like it was done in a hurry with many white spots in it and with little taste.  The egg role wasn't bad although they did not serve with hot mustard sauce.  I will not be returning to this place.",

The garlic eggplant (yuxiang qiezi) had excellent flavor and we also highly recommend the twice cooked pork (hui guo rou) and fried green beans (ganbian sijidou). The prices are certainly reasonable for the size and quality of the food. The open kitchen is also a nice touch as it gives kids something fun to stare at (flames shoot up from the dishes being cooked every few minutes). Admittedly, we only went because out POS airline put us up at the residence inn across the street after we missed a connecting flight, however, if we go back to Phoenix or if we lived in Phoenix, we'd definitely go to Szechwan Palace again.",

I have had house chicken many places but none quite like this.  Also, white rice with soy sauce was substitued for brown rice,  I know brown rice well, this didn't even look like brown rice, I am not sure it was jasmine either.  I wish I could say I had the run of the mill chinese meal,  it would feel better.  I said I had been here before with my sister-in-law but I didn't mention she was Taiwanese.

    "text": "This was a great way to end my stay in Arizona! It was also the first time I saw any Chinese people in Phoenix. Located in the Chinese Cultural Center of Phoenix, Szechwan Palace has delicious Chinese food (reminds me of home), and is located close to the airport if you're looking for a quick and delicious meal.   My mom's friend took me here for a quick dinner before dropping me off at the airport. She goes there often so the waitstaff already knew her favorite dish and bantered a bit, teasing me because of my Taiwanese accented Mandarin and because I can't read Simplified Chinese (it's so confusing though, with all the straight lines and boxiness...). The food was great, the inside clean (light wood floors and tables and white painted walls, making it feel very spacious and airy).    We ordered:   1. Wu Gen Chang Wan - I don't know the English name of this, but it's a stew of pigs intestine, pig's blood, leek, white cabbage (the one in kimchi), and red peppers. It was the perfect kind of spice, that warms your mouth, but didn't distract from the flavor of the pickled vegetables, the lightly textured blood, and the flavor of the intestine. The intestines were extremely tender without any chew to them, so you could bite right through and taste the fat and the flavor. It wasn't even stinky at all.   2. Yi Xiang Eggplant - Your usual eggplant from a Chinese restaurant, but with a Szechwan kick. Japanese eggplant sliced and lightly fried in a sauce that was mildly spicy with a hint of sweetness. It had small pieces of minced pork as well. The eggplant was not too fried or burnt on the outside, but well-done and soft on the inside.   3. Hong Shao Pai Gu - This is like a braised pork ribs, served with whole shiitake mushrooms and sliced bamboo shoots. Some of the meat was a little tough, but the overall flavor was great (mostly soy sauce, maybe a little tamarind). This dish was NOT spicy, so it was a good break for my mouth in between the other dishes.   4. Bo Cai - Sauteed spinach with garlic. Fairly typical, the kind of spinach that makes your teeth feel like they've been scraped. Good to get a little green in  there.   The atmosphere was pretty nice and conducive to a conversation. Apparently you can request more spice; I didn't know that or I would have. I guess this is the usual mild level that they give to new customers.   It seemed the place was very popular; there were constantly people coming in and out, and several families with small children, which the staff was very accommodating to (with booster seats and high chairs). There were also many Chinese patrons, which is always a good sign. It was also nice to hear conversational Mandarin around me after so long...  If I ever return to Phoenix, I'm coming straight here to get a real Chinese food fix!",

We have a handful of good Sichuanese places in the San Francsico area, and this place would fit right in.  One tip: Order from the \"Chinese menu\". If you're looking at the menu that has \"Mongolian Beef\" or Egg Foo Yung, that's the wrong menu.   I can only comment on the dishes I ordered from the one outing, but they all shined:  -Water Boiled Fish (Shui Zhu Yu). There are different versions with beef, pork, or lamb, but the cooking preparation is the same. Spicy with red chili peppers and a healthy dose of Sichuan peppercorns which give a pleasant numbing/tingling sensation to the spice.  -Cumin Lamb: Healthy dose of cumin. Good rendition.  -Chongqing Spicy Chicken (Chongqing lazi ji): Ask for \"with  bones\". The meat comes from the chicken wing and drumette portion.  Comes covered with red chili peppers, but push those aside and just chowdown on the chicken wings and spit out the bones.  -Green beans (gan bian si ji dou). A good rendition with some pungent garlic.   big thumbs up and I'll stop by here again when I'm in the area for work.",

The breading was all wrong, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was an abomination.  Where was the soy sauce?  The ginger?  I submit to you that they simply took sweet and sour sauce, mixed in some hot pepper paste, and called it General Tso's.  I have made General Tso's several times, and nothing about this was even close.  The rest of the dish was forgettable... Just your typical white rice and water.  I'm sure this place has some good dishes, but I clearly didn't order one of them.",

So unless you enjoy burning sensations on your palate, you might not like food items I'm mentioning here.  I've been here many many times with my Chinese friends and roommates, so obviously they are always the ones who order. Our typical fare includes\" a big bowl soup to share, a cold dish #1 (which means something husband and wife - includes beef tongue, stomach, etc in oil, herbs, chilies and roasted peanuts ), spicy chicken with bone in, any of spicy beef or pork dish, and some sort of stir fried veggie.   We love the food here and think it's pretty authentic - which also means that some can be very very oily.",

    "text": "This is the first restaurant that I have seen that is open until exactly 9:15pm. It is an odd closing time and maybe they were in a rush at 8:45pm packing my to-go order because my two spring rolls at $2 were left out. The dipping sauce for those spring rolls were in there and that ended up getting dumped on the white rice that was included with my noodle dish which is also unusual. So, I tried rice noodles with beef, but rice noodles in this joint are not Singapore style (which I wanted), but instead were chow fun style whic is like american egg noodles basically. The english spoken by the front counter owner was not perfect and she also seemed in a rush to make that crazy 9:15 time a reality. Ok, so the noodles and the onions and scallions in the dish tasted like any other place, but the nasty, unedible and in some pieces uncooked (9:15?) pieces of beef really earned this place its one star. I order beef like once in three years in Chinese places knowing that every place usually sucks and this was no exception. The owner could have mentioned that i could have gotten all veggies, but she didn't when I questioned her and I didn't figure out on the long menu that i could have gotten the same dish for $7.95 with no disgusting beef on the American side of the menu instead of paying a buck more. There must be an asian TV show that starts at 9:30pm or something because I doubt you will ever see a 9:15pm closing time ever again. I think the show is called \"food no Good\"",

    "text": "I've been to this Szechuan restaurant on numerous occasions. Their chef is from Szechuan, and their extensive menu encompasses both authentic and Americanized dishes.  The sizable square-shaped interior includes good lighting, booths, lazy Susans, and traditional Chinese artifacts.   The flavors of their Szechuan specialties are far more compelling than the Americanized items. These dishes often include meat, innards, or fish served in red chili pepper and a pool of tongue-numbing hot oil. The propensities of these dishes can be so intense that I often counteract with an order of light tasting vegetable or non-spicy items to lift the taste buds.  For appetizer, I recommend the Beef Tendon in Spicy Sauce ($6.95). The strips of shaved tendon came with firm textures seasoned by hot oil. The same tongue numbing effect can be felt with an order of Fuqi Feipian ($6.95), another chilled dish prepared with beef shank, heart, and tripe.   For main entrees, my favorite is the Mao Xue Wang ($15.95), a dish stacked with red chili, hot oil, pork blood, intestines, luncheon meat, tripe, and bean sprouts. The Water Boil Fish ($10.95) can be a good choice too due to the thick cuts of fish filets and light tasting ingredients that work in contrast to the heavier spicy oil. Their Ma Po Tofu ($7.95) was fresh, spicy, and addictive too.  Dishes that I like to order to accompany the numbing flavors are the Spicy Cabbage stir-fry ($6.95) and Tea Smoked Duck ($12.95). The sweetness of the cabbage tends to outweigh the peppers in it. The duck's tea smoked flavors had the same effect, but the meat can also appear leaner and boney than expected. I was disappointed in the Xiao Long Bao ($???) due to its thicker skins and ground pork that needed more seasoning. The much anticipated juicy effect was nonexistent.   The dishes that I don't recommend are the Cumin Lamb ($13.95) and Water Boiled Pork Kidney ($9.95). The composition of the lamb stir-fry with cumin, chili, and sesame was spot on, but the meat was cut too small for me to fully enjoy it. The Water Boiled Pork Kidney ($9.95) also fell into this category for the thinly shaved kidney that tends to lose its ways and chewy texture.  I had mix results with the Americanized dishes. In particular, both the Walnut Shrimp ($12.95) and Orange Chicken ($8.95) failed to stand out. The flavor on the deep-fried chicken with orange slices and sweet and sour sauce fell flat. I'm not sure why they use sweet and sour sauce, and a hint of spiciness would have made it more dynamic. Additionally, the House Foo Young ($10.95) that came with eggs and a mix of seafood and meat was delicious, but the thick savory gravy made it too salty in the end.  Lastly, the Dan Dan Noodle ($5.95) was not made wit the right sauce. The Spicy Wonton ($5.95) was too skimpy and the rice plates such as Shrimp Fried Rice ($7.95) and House Fried Rice ($7.95) were pretty ordinary without the wok tossed airy texture.  Service can be wildly inconsistent depending on the individual server that I was assigned to. Overall, the Szechuan items were tasty and enough to bring me back for more. They also have a lunch special menu but prospective diners should consider their water boiled dishes, meat items, cold plates, and stir-fried vegetables in order to get a decent fare. 2.5 stars. I hope to visit their Chandler location to see if they are any better.",

Overly coated with sauce and you couldn't tell what was meat/bone. The house fried was exceptionally good.  I had ordered \"beef with onions\" which was exactly like Mongolian beef. Nothing spectacular about it but it was good. Now the steamed pork dumplings on the other hand were exceptional! So delicate and so delicious and so hot that it melts in your mouth!

I guess Phoenix doesn't have enough customers to appreciate Szechuan cuisine at it's finest.   Food:  Me: Mapo tofu  Lady: American or Chinese style?  Me: .....?? *In my head* I'm freakin Chinese give me the Chinese one!   Mapo Tofu - I should have order the American one...what she was really asking is Cantonese or Szechuan. Cantonese is sweeter with a semi thick sauce. Szechuan version is soaked in hot oil which did not set well for my stomach and it is the knumbing version which makes you feel like crap if you're not use to it.   Sizzling rice soup - MSG soup with snow peas, baby corn, chicken and shrimp. Ok ok I should expect a dish like this to such, but my American side was craving this...don't judge me!   Service:  Limited English staff. Chinese attitude. I Love it! But not after a long day at work.   Environment:  It actually looks pretty nice in here. About 60% of their patrons are actually Chinese with limited English.   Price:  Wasn't expensive for the type of food served. Americanized menu is much cheaper.

    "text": "Came here looking for soup dumplings after having an amazing experience in NYC's Chinatown. I know it's really not fair to compare this place with what we had in NYC, but I definitely left disappointed.   The service was lightening fast, but there was definitely the feeling that we received different service since we weren't Asian. For example, soup dumplings are pretty impossible to eat without the small porcelain spoon, but we received no utensils to eat them with at all.   The eggplant was good, but was saltier and more sour than I was expecting. My mother said that her duck was pretty dry despite the copious amount of sauce on the plate.   Overall, I would say good effort for Phoenix, but I won't be returning.",

Got the Kung pao chicken one minute later with peanuts and more pepper than chicken. Got the disgusting fish later. Did not finish the soups and sent the chicken back. After the waiter told me I never told him about the peanuts.  The fish had no flavor at all and had a bad smell. We did not eat it. Got back the chicken with so many peppers we used the fish plate as trash to clean the plate. Also kept picking peppers out of our teeth. The waiter came back and told me \"you didn't like the fish\" and left.  We never saw him again. The soup bowls were still on the table, along our pepper plate and our trash can fish plate. The hostess asked us if we wanted to take the food. WE DECLINED!!! We paid for everything and left hungry. What a disaster. Will never go back.",

It comes with salad and soup and choice of rice, however the server said \"egg drop soup\" - not asking, but I figured a lucky guess, then he left. He never made eye contact, didn't ask what kind of rice or salad dressing. The soup came, still no eye contact or words. It tasted like canned. Then the food - again, just put there and the waiter disappeared before I could say anything.  The tea never showed up, nor did they check to see if I needed anything else before bringing the bill.       The \"salad\" was a micro bit of iceberg lettuce swimming in Ranch dressing (really? at a Chinese restaurant?) I did't want to use a soup spoon to eat a salad, so I didn't eat it. The entree was swimming in too salty of a brown sauce, and the egg roll was marginal. Find somewhere else to go.",

Even though his basket was full he put soup ball on the basket and it slipped. The soup was all over my sister's leg, foot, shoes and her skirt. NO ONE CAME!!! The person who was cleaning the table was looking at us and gave tissues. No apologies. We asked for the wet towel but some other server gave us dry towel and left. My sister has to go to bathroom to clean her self. When she was out of bathroom I thought someone will come and reserved the issue. NO ONE CAME!! We decide to leave so we called the server and tell him we are living. He was trying to make us pay for the food. I told him I will not pay after all those things are happened. He says \"I dont know what happened.. give me a second\" (This person was who gave us dry towels). He brings other lady, and she looked confused. I told her what happen, she was trying to make excuses. I told her we are living and she says ok. And turned around and goes to the other table. We are so frustrated that there was no apologies, they were treating us like we spilled that soup, and it was no big deal for them.",

    "text": "So I'll admit, I actually thought Miu's in Tempe INVENTED this style of cuisine. I had never had it or even seen it anywhere besides there (probably because of that whole \"secret menu\" thing chinese restaurants like to do). So when I moved from the Tempe area a few months ago, not being a stones throw from Miu's was, quite honestly, the saddest part.  When I found out the Szechwan Palace (Located about three blocks from where I used to live in Arcadia, BTW) also offered the spicy cucumbers, dan dan noodles, and spicy lamb ribs I had come to love, I was so excited to try it and PRAYED it would fill the void in my life that Miu's once filled.  Well, it didn't.  That's not to say it's not like 1000x better than any other \"Americanized\" Chinese restaurant out there (Also, it's hilarious that they have a an actual section of the menu called \"Americanized Chinese\"), but when comparing Apple to Apples (which I always do when it comes to restaurants like this) Miu's is a 5 and Szechwan is about a 3. Here's my deal (and i ordered my exact order):  1) Spicy cucumbers were warm  One of the most delightful aspects of this dish is the cool temperature combined with the heat.  Warm cucumber are gross.  2) Dan Dan noodles were standard. Much cheaper than Miu's though so that got them a star  3) Spicy Lamb Ribs were a little weak. I get that I'm a white girl drinking pinot grigio, but a can handle my heat.  Please don't coddle me.   Basically, if you need szechwan in the area, which I do, I'm glad they are here.  But if you are looking for top notch food, go to miu's.  If you're looking for top notch service, don't get chinese, because it sucks everywhere.",

    "text": "I have lived in Phoenix for about 18 months now.  My first six months I had plenty of chances to eat out.  The whole time I was looking for more authentic Chinese food.  Not the overly sweet sauces of americanized Chinese food, but edgier stuff.  While living in the Netherlands (where Chinese food is even worse than Phoenix) we learned that good Chinese restaurants have two menus, one for the casual Chinese eater looking for a step up from Panda Express and Chinese buffets and one menu for the die hards, native Chinese food eaters.  Often these menus are not even in English (or Dutch as it were).  Well, my looking in Phoenix has come to an end.  Szechwan Palance has such a menu.  Granted, theirs is not so seret, they share the same menu, but in different sections.  I have been here twice and I have found the food to be quite good.  there are some edgier dishes that we have not braved yet (i.e. kidney, brains, intestines, odd seafood etc.) but the ones we have tried have been quite tasty.    Dan Dan Noodle, simple and right on, small bowl, but rather cheap. Chinese egglplant in spicy bean sauce - very good, ordered it twice, and I do not even like eggplant. Beef boiled soup - I have grown to love this dish over the last few years (starting in netherlands),  There are so many flavors and interesting items included.  We love to get rice with it to sop up as much juice as we can.  though we have been told by friends that broth is simply there to cook the meat and veggies, not to eat as a soup.  We have Chinese national friends and they all claim it is a great place for authentic Chinese Szechwan.    The Service - many comment on the service - OK it is only so so.  Last time we were there they never even asked us if we wanted anything to drink.  Had to ask them to clear dishes etc.  Not really rude, just not what we are used to in restaurants.  I wont let this curtain our dinning there, I count it as part of the experience.",

In fact, I didn't see any wait staff for quite some time.  Yes, we were there at an earlier dining time but seriously, we didn't expect to be ignored.

Started out with the Cold Noodles in Chile Peanut Sauce-not so good (needed some ground nuts, cut scallions & soy sauce) but then,...great House Fried Rice, Mongolian Lamb and Sauteed Dried Green Beans. Just the right amount of heat. General Tsao's Chicken was really good tho I wouldn't have thought to order it. Good service as well.

If you placed your order close to 3, they have utter confusion on what to do. Call and confirm with them. Also, they have this stupid policy of giving one tiny takeout box of rice even if you ordered 10 dishes. Please keep that in mind and order rice.",

We ordered beef tripes, and they're delicious.  We also tried the kidney, love it! The chicken in hot wok, love it! The steamed whole tilapia, you HAVE TO try it!!! Super delicious!!!  The water-boiled series are a little bit turned down for me. The taste is weird and there should be way more vegetables in the soup.   In general, pretty good place to have some schzhuan style food.",

When it comes to dining my bf and I are very simple people and will tip very well. Once it was time to paybwe saw the cashier giving another customer and ASU discount since she had their ASU ID. Once we asked about it, she said they didnt offer it.  wtf lol. So did we not get a discount because because he was black and I was mexican or was it whomever you choose? Wish I could give this place zero stars but can't so my advice is just don't go eat there it is gross and disgusting.",

However as we were just finishing our meals we were 'visited' by a roach crawling across our table.  Then of course we thought we could feel them crawling all over us.  We didn't of course, but did see more crawling around on the wall next to our table.  Gross and disgusting.

Due to flight delays, I ended up missing my pre-interview dinner social, so I walked over to Szechwan Palace from my hotel for dinner.  I'm glad I did! There were a few other Chinese restaurants in this plaza as well. Szechwan Palace had an extensive menu (as expected), and I found it amusing that they even had a section in the back explicitly labeled \"Americanized Chinese Food.\" xD Definitely order the authentic stuff though!  Unfortunately, my phone was not working so I don't have any photos of my food, but I had an amazing meal of sliced beef tendon appetizer and a fried intestines clay pot dish with bean sprouts. I went through several bowls of rice (also because I was starving), and still had leftovers.  Service was okay, but I also spoke Mandarin. Prices are reasonable, and portions are good. The interior of the restaurant is very nicely decorated, better than I expect for an authentic Chinese place, and there are plenty of seats.   I also had fun exploring the Asian grocery in the same plaza after my meal.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND, just make sure you can handle that Szechwan spice! ;)",

We went in and were seated right away. Our waitress was very friendly and took great care of us!   I ordered the Szechwan beef and my friend got a Kung Pao Chicken. The food came out within 10 minutes so I was pleased, although there were only about 6 other customers eating. I found the food to be good, but similar to other Szechwan places I've tried in the past.   Will definitely come back if I'm in the area shopping at the Asian market.",

From Peking Duck to the best tripe to the best pork bellies, these people really do it right proper!  They don't deliver, but  you can order through Amazon and Uber.  Mike the owner is maybe the best small business owner I've ever met!  He cares about his customers, and he treats his employees extremely well.

There's still plenty of good offerings to be had. The place is hectic as always, and that's nothing new. Service isn't amazing, but you really shouldn't expect for it to be. These people are *REALLY* Chinese, and I'm sorry to say that most Asian restauranteurs don't conform to the American standards of courtesy. It's a different culture, and it is what it is- deal with it. You'll probably have to wave a server down if you want something, because they won't be doting on you every five minutes. This is usually born from the fact that they have a HELL of a lot going on all at once, so don't take it personal, guailo.  Anyhow... the lunch today really wasn't amazing. It was fine, but I expect better from this place. The egg roll was just plain mushy, and that wasn't cool. The hot and sour soup was airport-restaurant quality. Now, I understand that for the lunch rush they probably just prepare an ass-ton of food in the back, and serve it to order. I get that. However, after my meal today I couldn't in good conscience give another five-star rating.  The Dan Dan noodles were good. The pork short ribs were good. The rice was mushy, but once again I think that it was just a victim of being large-batch cooked for the lunch rush. I was a *little* annoyed by the skeptical look that the woman gave me when I ordered off of the Chinese menu, but by now that shit pretty much just rolls off.",

I highly recommend any of the 'water-boiled' dishes, especially the water-boiled beef. The literal translation from Chinese does not make it sound very appetizing, but trust me, if you like spicy food, then this is a great option. Also delicious are the spicy cucumber appetizer, pork with bamboo shoot, Yu Xiang pork, beef with pickled chili pepper, the wonderful eggplant, and a staple of every Szechuan restaurant; the stir-fried/dry-fried green beans. In general, this place uses copious amounts of Szechuan peppercorn, which I am a big fan of.  I usually get take-out, so can't comment much on the service.",

In fact one of our appetizers arrived after the entrees. (We did remind the waiters a few times but still no avail). We had to wait a long time for each of our dishes. In fact that is one of the main reasons I gave this place 3 stars.",

Order from the chinese menu, dont go with the cliche of kung pao chicken when all of these yummy dishes exist.",

    "text": "In short: I got a run of the mill Chinese meal here, but I didn't know to ask for the \"real\" menu. Service was excellent for as busy as they were.  So I went to the Chinese Cultural center on Sunday, Chinese New Year, looking for Chinese culture. I found a street fair with such cultural gems as a booth for Wells Fargo loans, and one selling \"crazy Chinese hats.\" I wanted authentic food, and the booths selling egg rolls and stuff from the market buffet were pretty much the opposite of what I was there for. So my date for the event and I decided to try one of the Chinese restaurants at the center, and I chose Szechwan Palace because I was in the mood for something spicy.  The place was packed, which was to be expected. Since a good portion of the conversation I heard taking place was in Chinese, I was hopeful that that this would be an experience similar to what I'd get in Seattle's international district. I knew that wouldn't be the case when I saw the menu, which was basically the same menu you'll find in any americanized Chinese restaurant.  So we just ordered the Szechwan dinner for two. Hot & sour soup, crab rangoons, fried rice, general tso's chicken, szechwan shrimp, and a rice based desert that I forget the name of. I thought all the dishes were decent, but nothing had the spice I expect from Szechwan cooking.  After consulting Yelp, I know now there is a \"real\" Chinese menu here. That explains why this place could be so popular with native speakers. I wish I had known. This review reflects the disappointing experience I had with the menu I was presented with.",

    "text": "I AM AN IDIOT I've spent years bitching about the lack of even a DECENT chinese place near our house (Baja Arcadia). I kept looking to Scottsdale for somewhere to eat. We've got just about everything else, from real-deal taco shacks, to excellent Pho, to fine dining. But no real Chinese food. I was looking the wrong way. Up til recently, I would drive all the way to Wong's Place in Tempe just for the real stuff.  THE CHINESE CULTURAL CENTER I shop regularly at what used to be Ranch99, that oasis in the desert that makes you feel like you've been transported to the Hell that is Riverside CA. I've tried numerous restaurants in the mall over the years and always been disappointed. The one I never managed to try is the Szechwan Palace. I expected it to be just another Gringonese disaster. Man was I wrong. We eat out maybe once or twice a week, and we've hit this place at least once a week since we found it a few months ago.  SZECHWAN PALACE I love you, Palace. Dan Dan Noodles. Spice. Yu Xiang dishes. We've been when it's packed full of high maintenance Chinese businessmen and when we're one of 4 tables in the place. Every time, the tiny kitchen and the wonderful servers keep their smiles in place and just give you that little shake of the head that says: \"Solly, it clazy tonight!\" Even though this place pleases real Chinese food lovers, there's plenty of stuff to keep my Jewish mother-in-law happy too (\"happy\" is a relative term).  THINGS I LOVE   - Wan Fu: the worst white wine in the world (that I love)   - Dan Dan Noodles with extra hot chile   - Yu Xiang Shrimp   - Mongolian Beef with real beef, not that over-marinated rubbery crap   - Fresh veggies that still have some color and snap to them   - Incredibly spicy Water-boiled dishes   - Any of their soups  Wong's thick-skinned pot stickers are still the best, but everything else at the Palace rules.  BOTTOM LINE It's hard for me to imagine a bad review being credible unless some key person was missing or they were ridiculously understaffed and got slammed. We've been there for one of those nights though, and it was still very good, once we eventually got served. As others have said: get the real menu as you walk in. Otherwise, you'll get the Panda Express version. You'll also have to grab chopsticks. Other than that, just enjoy!",

The restaurant was plagued with \"out of foods\" often. A few months ago, the dimwitted waitress didn't tell us the appetizer was out till the end when I initiated the inquiry. Apparently she has already removed the \"out\" item from our bill.  The wait service for my last meal with a group of friends was better at 6:30 PM on a Saturday. We've got service from 3 different wait staffs. They were serving everybody else too. Not just us.  The food came out fast and the taste was right on this time. They were out of egg plant. We didn't tell them that 99 Ranch Supermarket was 2 doors down.  So diners, I still consider this place a good choice for authentic foods. I will give 3.5 stars this time.",

    "text": "Cha-ching! I got lucky my first time at Szechwan Palace! I had Helen Y. with me (Jason W. was along for the culinary experience as well), and she helped us navigate the Chinese menu, explaining about Szechwan cuisine and selecting some different dishes for us to try. I don't remember everything we tried, but the two standout dishes were definitely the fish filets and the water-boiled beef. The fish was cooked perfectly, with a creamy texture and a simple, sweet flavor. The water-boiled beef was spicy and so satisfying - my sinuses totally felt clearer as I ate it! I also enjoyed the soup buns. I'm not a big lamb fan, but the lamb riblets that Helen described in her review were good and would probably be a big hit with anyone who doesn't mind the gamier taste.   The restaurant's atmosphere isn't anything to write home about, but the service was decent and the prices (about $15 a person) were definitely really reasonable for the amount and quality of the food we tried. Thanks to Helen for introducing me to this place. When I go back with my husband (or anyone else who can't read the Chinese menu), at least I will have a few already-established favorites to order!",

Known as one of the Four Great Traditions of Chinese cuisine, Sichuan food can be described as spicy, hot, fresh and fragrant.   When you are seated, if you are white, they will give you the \"Whitey Menu\".  Politely ask for the \"Zhangguo cai dan\" or \"Chinese Menu\" and you will be presented with a nice, leather bound, menu filled with the best this place has to offer.  I have tasted about 9 dishes from this place and each one was excellent.   A word of warning, their hottest dishes are the \"Water Boiled xxxxx\" dishes literally drowning in mouth-numbing Sichuan peppercorns and can be a challenge for even the most seasoned spicy food lovers.  I believe they have toned it down a bit (I was actually told this by a 10-year vetran of this spot) and the last time I had it, it was significantly less spicy, but still about a 9 - 10 on a 10pt spicy scale.  Previously it was essentially inedible to my Nordic tongue, this last time it was enjoyable.... so buyer beware.  I was going to go 4 stars, actually about 4.5, but given the fact that there is not a better Sichuan spot in AZ, it gets 5 stars.  Go, eat, enjoy.",

I came here with some of my classmates one evening after class at ASU.  Luckily, two of them were native Mandarin speakers, as well as my professor having lived in China for a couple of years, so they were all business when it came down to ordering food.  Since going to this restaurant, I am addicted.  There is no other word for it.  My friend and I go at least once a week where we order the same things.  In fact, we go so often that we are immediately seated at the same table by the staff, and sometimes not even given menus.    What do we eat?  We eat: cold noodles (liang fen), fuqi feipian (cold spicy beef tripe, tongue, and other parts), and water-boiled beef (we ask for it extra-spicy).    After numbing your mouth, I suggest taking a sip of water OR ordering a Tsingtao beer.  You'll be amazed at how sweet tasting the beer is!  I am moving out of the Phoenix area to New England soon, and I am more than distraught that I will no longer be able to enjoy Szechuan Palace.  I've threatened to kidnap the chef, but I'm not sure he'd enjoy being stored in my kitchen.    One of the main suggestions for this restaurant is: DO NOT ORDER THE ORANGE CHICKEN.  (hint: it's not really chinese food) Instead, ask one of the servers what the chef's special is for the day.  Or, try out one of my fave dishes.  You won't be disappointed!",

OK, so I'm a Bay Area native and love Sichuan food; I'm white and my girlfriend is Asian. We walk in the door, are seated, and handed the simple menu.  NOTHING of interest on the menu.  We decided on two very basic dishes (General Chou's Chicken and a Sichuan Prawm dish).  The Chicken was atrocious - dry, old-tasting, and nothing but a pile of chicken - no vegetables, no spice, nothing. The shrimp dish was marginally better, but nothing to write home about.   Meanwhile, everyone at other tables seemed to be ordering stuff that we didn't see on the menu ... \"maybe there's a Chinese menu we didn't see\" we said to each other ...   On our way out, we saw the 'Chinese' menu ... full of the stuff we were looking for - \"pigs stomach with jalapeno\", etc .  So - I'm willing to believe they have good food, but - WHY oh WHY have a separate 'whites' menu? AND - when a white guy walks in with an Asian lady, WHY not give them the 'Asian' menu?  The 1 star accurately reflects the food we ate, and also applies to the waiter who did not think to offer us the appropriate menus.   We'll probably head back to Chandler for our next Chinese food experience.",

So I wasn't surprised when partner and I were given the \"other\" menu when we walked in on a Saturday night. One thing I liked instantly about the place is that it's spacious, with enough distance between the tables, and is well-lit. The restaurant was pretty full when we came in, at about 7, but we were immediately given a place to sit. For appetizers, we got the fried wontons with mustard and hot sauce dips. I thought the wontons were a little too crispy, and I would have liked some more filling in them. The service was fast and efficient, and we got the appetizers within seven minutes of being seated. For the main course, I got the Happy Family and partner got the Cashew chicken. They came with a medium sized bowl full of steamed rice. I had picked a Szechwan place because I was in the mood for spicy food, but both the dishes lacked any fire. We actually ended up getting hot sauce to spice things up! I liked the Happy Family....the veggies, meats and sauce made me happy. The portions were good for the price, though we did manage to eat everything up! I would have liked it though, if they offered tea with their food, as a complimentary add-on. And every table should have the usual condiments...soy sauce, a variety of hot sauces....those were strangely missing here. Also, I think everyone, regardless of whether they are Asians or not,  should be given both the menus. Whether I want to eat stomach of pork in sauce or pig's feet, is a choice I would like to make!",

We've dined here several times, and on Sunday, not surprisingly, we were the only non-Asian customers in the place. The chef was in rare form, and as I sit here having my third round of leftovers for lunch I'm still loving my dish. I opted for the Vinegar Fish, it's pretty simple -- whitefish, wood ear mushrooms and water chestnuts prepared with a dose of spice and rice wine vinegar. I'm guessing by the waitress' excitement when I ordered, that it's a dish they're pretty proud of. It was fabulous.  Hubby ordered the Beef and Onions, which I would classify as good, but not mind-blowing. We also partook of the Gai-choy which was cooked perfectly -- just the right amount of garlic and tenderness.   In the past I've really loved their Mapo Doufu (tofu), theirs is one of the best I've had anywhere. Next time I'm planning on having the Water-Boiled Eel. I heart eel, mmm.  Service is pretty barebones, so don't expect to be sucked-up to. It's perfunctory and efficient, the food comes up fast and they leave you alone. I can't complain about that one bit.",

The dumplings in chili oil, vegetable fried rice and hot and sour soup are our regular items, usually supplemented by one other dish.  The food is consistently great.  Service is very fast and efficient, but they don't dote on you like some fine dining places.  Highly recommended!",

We stopped here because the shopping complex looked very appealing - makes you feel like you are really entering China town (a less people around though!!)! We had the szechwan chicken & chicken fried rice & szechwan pork... all dishes were good, tasty not bland and definitely filling. Sunday afternoon was fairly quiet so we didn't have to wait long to be served our food.  We will visit again to try another dish.  Customer service was adequate - waitress greeted us warmly, wasn't too talkative, but helpful when we asked questions about a dish we thought about trying.  When we were leaving,  she invited us to return and that was nice.",

We noticed when Asians came into the restaurant they were only given the black menu, we had to ask for it.   That aside, the food was flavorful and tasty, but, even \"hot\" dishes were far from hot, even though we asked for them to be very hot.   Dumplings were a bit over done and soggy. While I've not been to china, this wasn't on par with Sichuan places I've been to in NY and other major cities. I do really want to try their 'Hot Pots' so am looking forward to go back for that.   Service was swift and polite.   Knowing Mandarin Chinese or having a friend that knows it woudl help.   So if you take the Szechwan part out of it, I think it's a decent place to go for what I can only guess is Americanized Chinese food in general.  The water cooked chicken had a very interesting herbal spice to it and was very pleasant with other dishes on the table.",

Finally, ordered dim sum at the beginning and 45 minutes later asked about status.  Was told that it takes 20 minutes for dim sum and watched someone run to the kitchen afterwards. Dim sum came out 10 min later with pink pork inside.  Phoenix culinary experience can benefit from a decent authentic Chinese restaurant. This restaurant is in a Chinese cultural center.

And those that do go get Sichuan style food :) Located in the same shopping plaza as the Super L, Szechuan Palace specializes in chile and peppercorn laden dishes that turn up the heat and tingle your senses. The use of the fragrant, almost floral tasting peppercorn not only adds flavor but it numbs your tongue.  We ordered the Chongqing chicken (boneless), water boiled fish and dry saute green beans. The chicken and fish had the requisite spicy, salty bold punch to them and my tongue was numb in seconds after eating it. I was glad we ordered some sauteed green beans because it helped provide a tongue numbing break in between spicy bites. While the chicken and fish provided the spicy kick I wanted, the flavors weren't as developed as other restaurants I've been to (Such as the sadly defunct Miu's). The chicken and fish were tender though, and overall enjoyable. The green beans were perfectly seasoned and cooked perfectly. We finished the plate in a record amount of time.  The restaurant was fairly busy when we came for dinner around 8 on a Thursday. Most of the people eating here were Chinese speaking families, friends, or couples- always a good sign for good quality Chinese food. Note that while our main server did speak English, another waitress did not, so it helps if you know Mandarin or are with someone that knows it.",

We asked if they did separate checks, we were told no problem so I thought we were at a great start. How quickly that changed.  Here is what I noticed, if you are a regular, you seem to get great service, even a smile or laugh out of the staff, but if you are just some random diner picking this place to eat, then expect minimal to no service. The staff (I say staff because we had more than one person working for our table) was aloof and non-caring, sure they took our orders and brought us the food, but to ask for water, drinks, silver wear or even a clean spoon because the one brought with the soup was dirty, was a task, they seem happy to just take the order and slam the food down on the table when it's cooked.  Just really bad service.  The food on the other hand, I had ordered the Szechwan beef, it was sliced beef sauteed with veggies in a spicy Szechwan sauce. This was a great dish!  All though it states on the menu this dish is spicy, I found that it was just flavorful, so for me it could have been a tab bit spicier. I really enjoyed my dish, before I knew it, it was gone!  Great food, bad service, so sad, because I'm sure I would have enjoyed coming back, but I don't really enjoy paying & tipping for bad service (just because the server is bad doesn't mean you cheap out on the tip, others rely on that too) Hats off to the kitchen for some great tasting food!",

I've regretted one or two choices, but I have no doubts about the quality and authenticity of the food.

Of course not all dishes they serve are that way; you can get mild dishes such as the fish fillet & egg white dish that I ordered; that one featured nicely seasoned, very tender fish fillets in a white sauce with ribbons of egg white. The servings are generous (I ordered the dan dan noodles as appetizer and it was listed as such, but it came as a meal-sized portion) so come with a big appetite. The atmosphere is relaxed, service is middling, and location is convenient (Chinese Cultural Center on 44th Street near the 202).",

    "text": "Szechuan Palace Review  30 September, 2018 Location: 668 N 44th St #108, Phoenix, AZ 85008  Szechuan Palace is a small restaurant located in Phoenix, Arizona right off the 202 on N. 44th Street. The place is small in the very corner of the little shopping center. The best way to find it is to look for the giant Yin-Yang symbol right in front of it. I just recently went there with my family about a few weeks ago, right when you walk in there is already a list of chief specials. Which was good because I was actually thinking about what I should actually get. There were some chairs for us to sit on but luckily there was not a lot of people as it was lunch time. So we were given a table quick, and the lady who was serving us was nice to tell us again the special but also ask what we want to drink as well.  After that I was able to have time to look around, the restaurant is small yet nice. I was very clean and had a Chinese aesthetic to it that made it stand out from the other Chinese restaurants that I have been to before. From the lanterns hanging on the ceiling to the symbols laying around, it help give the place a sense of being homey as well as being relaxing. After we got our drink next was time to order. The food pricing was pretty good as the lunch specials were good in pricing ranging from around $8-$10 dollars. For me personally I got the chicken lo-mein, because it was something that I typically enjoyed eating. My family and I chatted while waiting talking about the place and how we all enjoyed it. It took 5 minutes for everything to come in which was very fast.   Everyone's dish looked amazing, mines specifically the chicken looked well cooked and the noodles were a crisp brown with the vegetables surrounding the edge of the huge plate. And the best part of the meal would be that the food stayed warm the entire time, and the steam kept pouring as I was eating. As I looked around at my family everyone was enjoying their time and loving the food that they got from orange chicken to sesame chicken. I looked around while eating and noticed that everyone was just chatting at the other tables enjoying their time and talking to the waiters. Our waiter came and asked what we thought of the food, we all agreed that the food was fantastic. The watier actually talked to use a bit more asking about what kind of foods we like and what they would recommend for the next time we come back. That was great as it can lead my entire family into trying something different every time.   Overall I think that the meal was worth it and especially for the price. Along with the overall environment was great very nice and relaxing and it made the experience even better. And the customer service was good as well as memorable as I can still remember what my family did talk about with out waiter. I would recommend Szechuan Palace to go eat whenever you're in the Phoenix area and it will be a great time.",

Where's the Beef!?! The last three times, I have gone to Szechwan Palace. The first time, I had orange chicken and it was tasty! For a lunch portion, I even had leftovers. The second time, I had Mongolian beef and it was good. There were plenty of pieces of beef. The third time, I had the house special chicken. I found out they don't include broccoli with the lunch portion. It wasn't a big deal, it was good. But, I have to admit that when I go back next time I'm definitely going with the orange chicken! The lunch specials come with salad, hot and sour soup or egg flower soup, vegetable egg roll and entree. I definitely recommend trying this place. The service is OK. Yesterday, they didn't refill our water. Other than that, it's great!",

Of all the Cofco asian restaurants, this is one of the more presentable ones to bring business clients or a new date, if ambiance is key to scoring positive brownie points.       For some bizarre reason, on the weekends, it is filled with asian-women/white guy couples,    which strikes me as hilarious.  If it wasn't for this,  I would eat there multiple times a week.  Asian woman orders from real chinese menu;  her white guy orders from chow mein menu.   Side note:  Get a grip; asian women check each other out, and  usually not in a nice way--like in a sizing you up-comparing you to herself way--so I usually end up losing my appetite when I catch one of them staring at me (and my man) and whispering to her white guy or her girlfriends about me;  yah, I understand the shit you say about me, asian girls, because I speak your language too, hello!   So I compensate for my chinese food cravings by quick carry out.  Works like a charm every time.  I'm happy, my own Cracker is happy.  Owner gets lots of business and is happy.    We all win.",

    "text": "We've just discovered two new awesome dishes at Szechwan Palace -  the cumin covered lamb riblets on the Chinese menu as well as the Water Boiled Fish Filets on the regular menu.  The lamb riblets are coated with cumin and other spices, quick fried and then wok-fried with whole dried chilies, Szechwan numbing red peppercorns and caramelized onions.  This is a finger-lickin' tasty dish which you have to eat with your fingers unless you have amazing chopstick skills.   The Water Boiled dishes are a famous Szechwan classic which I don't know why I haven't ordered until today.  The plain name is quite misleading.  It's a clear soup boiled with an insane amount of chilies, more numbing peppercorns, Napa cabbage, a little celery, fermented beans and garnished with sprigs of coriander.  You have choice of meat and we chose fish today.  The filets are coated with cornstarch and quickfried to preserve it's moisture and tenderness before adding to the stew.  This is by far the spiciest and most flavorful dish I've had here so far.  I think I'm hooked.  Let me stress that this restaurant excels at authentic Szechwan food, not American-style Chinese dishes or even Cantonese dishes.  Although the xiao long bao (Shanghainese soup buns) were surprisingly good.  I wonder if they share some dishes with the Shanghainese restaurant on the other side of Ranch Market, which was extremely quiet in contrast to Szechwan Palace which was packed with a weekday office lunch crowd.",

    "text": "Background on Egg Soup Supper Club: We are (for the most part) white, American, Chinese speakers. The majority of us are ASU students. We are all between the ages of 20 and 30 years old. We meet once a week at a different Chinese restaurant around the Tempe/Chandler area for Chinese food.  _______________________________________________________________  General thoughts:   We went to Szechwan Palace right in the middle of the government shutdown, so we were kind of limited in our choices of dishes. We usually get a shrimp dish of some kind, and base a large portion of our comparison review around that, but what with lack of import control, we all agreed that we didn't want salmonella.   Food: We got the water boiled fish ( ). It was pretty dang good. The sauce was just spicy enough to be delicious, but not so spicy to be unedible (except that's not a word. Whatever). There was a lot of it. I don't think we finished it all.   We wanted to order dry beef pot (? ), but they didn't have it. One of our members said that they have it at the Chandler location, but not at this one. Instead, they recommended cumin beef (). It was decent. The cumin flavor was very strong. However, it was not my favorite thing I've ever had.   We always order eggplant (). This place had some very excellent eggplant for us. We were not disappointed. The pieces were kind of ginormous, but the flavor was good, and they were definitely not cooked to the point of gooey. They were delightfully firm--almost like a party in my mouth.   Other dishes we ordered were garlic spinach (). It was good. The Chinese people at the next table over asked what it was so they could order some. The dragon rolls (? I have no idea. ) were to die for. They were big and juicy and probably one of my favorite foods of the night. The garlic green beans () were to die for, and very large in portion. Actually, all the portions are large. I think we were all stuffed at the end, and still had some left over.   All in all, it was pretty dang good food. The service, however, was lacking. We saw our guy maybe three times. We had to flag him down to order, and he always seemed distracted when we were talking to him. Meanwhile, he was chatting it up with all the other ethnic Chinese people. At the end, he gave us the wrong check, but was gone within seconds, so we had to flag down someone else to give us the right one. She was not impressed with him either. This is the reason that they got three stars instead of four.   Miscellaneous thoughts:  Number of people: 5 Cost per person: ~$13 Food: 8 Service: 5 Authentic: Yes",

I didn't take notice of any frozen veggies being used, but it wouldn't surprise me...Times being what they are, everyone tries to cut corners...on the other hand, the price charged for our large group was reasonable, the decor was fine, and the location had plenty of accessible parking and felt safe.  The food did taste authentic but boring at best!---I guess that it is a cultural thing, and I need to get culturalized!  I did get tested for ---(never mind!), anyway, the culture turned out negative!---lol  I give it three stars---One for parking, one for location, and one for authenticness....

    "text": "Man, we were really looking forward to this. After watching the Sichuan episode of Bizarre Foods the other day I realized that, while I have had Sichuan dishes before, I had never had hot pot. We usually go to the Chinese Cultural Center for Golden Buddha and had never tried Szechwan Palace.  So, the four of us headed over there with eager anticipation. There were warning signs right away. Wife: \"I'd like hot tea please.\" Waiter: \"we're out of cups!\" They were out of other stuff too. Still, we found plenty to order. Food started coming out pretty fast, one dish at a time, over a period of about a half an hour. If you want all of your food at once you would hate this, but we were sharing everything anyway, so that part did not bother me.   But lots of other stuff did bother me. Dan Dan Noodles were good. Everything else was bland...including the hot pot. They forgot our spicy dumplings. The waiter disappeared for about twenty minutes at a time. Our table was placed in such a way that people were constantly asking me to move my chair. I could go on. Just a bad customer service experience and average food. Very, very disappointing,",

Szechwan Palace has some delicious, spicy cuisine that pops, when it hits your mouth.   Yes, they use my old nemesis sichuan ghost peppers and some mild red chili peppers as well. But for my dish, the ghost peppers were used sparingly and my mouth didn't go numb. LOL  The heat was a 6, on a 10 scale, and I loved it!  I ordered the Cold Noodle in a Sesame/Soy sauce, Spicy WonTons in Hot Oil and very spicy Boneless Chongqing Chicken. Everything was delicious and there was enough leftovers for the whole family the next evening. Nice!  My take out order ran me just $23 and Nancy who was working the phones & front desk was a hoot.  We had a mild language problem over bone-in, versus bone-out.  But she was patient and very accommodating with my verbal short comings.   I've noticed now you can also order Take-Out via the Yelp app. This will make it a lot easier for our next To Go trip.   Enjoy!",

Pretty much the same as last visit: good, tender, saucy entree, decent egg roll, atrocious salad. I ordered fried rice and got brown rice. The Hot and sour soup was okay but not great. They spice it with chili oil, not straight peppers, so it was greasy.   The service was two stars only. Efficiency was priority one, regardless of customer service. My server got my order wrong, I was never asked what I wanted to drink, my plate was delivered without looking at me (she was checking on a neighboring table), same with the check.   A lot of oriental customers, which spoke for authenticity but service needed to improve.   This business closed December 10, 2018.",

I ordered the Chongqing chicken (boneless) and it was quite an experience. It was the first time eating this dish and my tongue literally got numb while I was eating it. It wasn't painful or other burning sensation that makes you sweat but was type of spicy that silently numbed your tongue. I found out that my  tongue went numb only when I drank my water to quench my dry throat. Since I love spicy food, I enjoyed the experience. It was strange but still fun. By the quality of the dish, I could tell that the chefs were very skilled and that made me want to come back tomorrow to try other dishes that won't numb my tongue. :) I highly recommend.",

    "text": "With Chinese restaurants, I always tell my friends that you're dining at them for the food, not the service.  Service is always secondary and to lower your expectations substantially.    That said, the Szechwan food they make here is pretty spot on as far as authenticity is concerned.  Good use of the Ma-la seasonings and Szechwan peppercorns that give you the spiciness and the mouth numbing qualities.    The Dan Dan Mian is pretty basic, using what I am sure is spaghetti noodles, and placing the noodles into a small bowl with ma-la chile sauce, with a tiny bit of ground pork and some greens.  Toss the noodles around and mix that sauce in well, and you'll get good flavor with a nice heat and numbing sensation from the dish.  I noticed they had a dry hot pot dish made with Tea Tree Mushrooms, and ingredient I have never seen before.  It was dehydrated and packaged before being exported for retail sales.  With this dish, they weren't able to allow enough time to rehydrate the mushrooms so that they can be a little tender when cooked.  Rather, we ended up with a dish that was well seasoned, but the mushrooms were mostly tough and chewy....very difficult to eat.    The last dish we had was a combination dish with fish filet, beef, chicken, shrimp and vegetables (mainly bean sprouts and celery).  This dish was cooked well and had good heat to it.",

Food though, reminds me of the dishes my parents would cook way back when they still ate meat with me (darn vegans lol). And True to the style of szechuan Cuisine, the spice (tongue numbing spice, uniquely delicious) on their spicy dishes are not held back. They will even make it spicier if you request it.

The rice was good, but the meat didn't have much flavor, only spice. For the price I cannot recommend this dish. My co-worker got a shrimp meal for $17, and he was very underwhelmed by the taste as well.   For me, my rating may have been different if I had dined in depending on the service, but having ordered takeout I expected much more for the price, and the raving reviews over this place.

I had the (traditional) Cumin Lamb, and the taste was amazing and sort of Mediterranean. Very tender lamb, but the texture was a bit strange. Overall a bit greasy too, which my tummy wasn't crazy about. Lots of other tasty sounding dishes to try though.  Husband had (Americanized) Mongolian Beef. Beef was incredibly tender, and great flavor.  Chicken chow mein was good too. They only serve white rice, not fried or brown.  Great find in Phoenix, we'd definitely eat here again.",

    "text": "Since moving to the valley 5 years ago I've been struggling to find a really good Chinese restaurant. Especially one that sells real Chinese food.  I ordered the dan dan noodles and the pork in sweet been sauce. Both were really good. I didn't know what to expect with either dish but was pleasantly surprised with both. The noodles are spicy but not so much that the other flavors of the dish are hidden. And the sauce used on the pork was very simple but worked well with the perfectly cooked pork.   They have a large menu full of all your American Chinese favorites as well as a lot of traditional foods. The traditional menu seems to focus on foods from Sichuan province but there are lots of recipes from other regions as well, so even if you don't like spicy food, it's worth checking out the Chinese menu!",

We had fish and bean curd, sauteed string beans and pork buns ( strangely none of these on the online menu), but they were on the regular menu at the restaurant.  I really like the sauteed string beans, not crazy about the fish and bean curd because there were floating whole cardamom and star anise in the broth and if you accidentally eat them it's taste kind of minty and tangy at the same time, it was ok and my husband liked it. My son liked the pork bun as well. I really want to try something else next time, overall it was good.  When you check if on yelps, you'll get free fried egg rolls.",

My friend and I definitely did not experience even mediocre service.  We were seated within a short couple of minutes of waiting.  Our server didn't bother with small talk; went right into \"Do you know what you want to order?\"  Just like I said in my review with their neighbor Beijing Garden, I can appreciate speedy service for the patrons on their lunch break but service was lacking.  They brought out the wrong order for my friend but it was replaced with the correct one in a reasonable time.  We were never checked up on nor our drinks refilled.  We finished our lunch rather quickly but waited a long time for our check to be brought.  Realizing the time, I went up front to ask for our check and to-go box.  After the time it took to finally pay, we only had 6 minutes to make it back to work on time.  Luckily, we work very very close by and made it back on time.  Like Beijing Garden, this one is another dud.  It's a decent place to satisfy your Chinese food cravings.  However, I don't think I'll be returning.",

It was only after we returned the dishes uneaten that the manager came and asked what we wanted. Additionally, upon receiving the check, the waiter yelled at us to not touch it as we tried to point out how to split the check. Would never step foot in that place again.",

It was pretty good here, though the numbing flavor that is the norm for this dish was a tad lacking.  String beans were solid.  We also had the cumin beef (usual is lamb, but we weren't feeling in a gamey mood today) and the chongqing chicken, both of which were great.  Oddly, the hot and sour soup was only slightly above average for me - what gives?!  Portion size was also a concern.  Most Szechuan places have huge portions, but we polished things off no problem and had to order a couple more plates...  Price was okay.  Service was also acceptable for me (unlike other Yelpers' experiences).  Would probably go back if I was in the area and had a hankering for Szechuan, though places in Chandler are better if you don't mind heading to the East Valley.",

Szechwan Palace met both these needs.  I understand the Asian population in Phoenix isn't as huge so they'd need to have the Americanized menu.  The soup was amazing and we even ordered an extra to go.  Anything spicy that you order will be SUPER spicy so be cautious when ordering.  It's authentic enough for me to want to come back here although I haven't tried any other places in the area yet.  I didn't understand the canned Lychee dessert at all, where's the mango pudding or the almond jelly?",

    "text": "First I would like to say to everyone that complains about the service is to please stop bitching about it. Yea most of you are stuck in American ways and things should be set in a certain way everywhere. This is a AUTHENTIC Chinese food restaurant, it's not they are being rude or don't want to come back every 2 mins to make sure you are ok it's because there is literally 2-3 waitress's working at a time. I've been here probably 50-60 times since its my fiance favorite Chinese place in phx, and shes from china and hates Americanized Chinese food, but every time I've been here when it's slow or packed I only see 2-3 waitress's and sometimes a helper here and there. So just be patient.   The food is worth the wait if you order correctly. I've had a few americanized dishes and they were ok and my fiance was like you need to order for, the authentic menu and wow I was surprised how Chinese food was suppose to taste like. Alot of the dishes have this weird tingly numbing feeling which is weird at first but you get used to it.   A few things I can remember you should get that we always order, I don't know the Chinese names but I'll try to explain the best I can.   1. Husband and wife dish. It's a app and seved cold. About 7 bucks 2. Boiled fish in spicy sauce.  3. Spicy chicken wings but these are cut in half deep fried then cooked in peppers and spices. My favorite  4. Cucumber dish served cold and has tingly stuff on it. Like 4-5 bucks 5. Pork intestines cooked like the chicken wings above. I know that sounds gross but they taste really good. 6. Beef chow fun, yea this is a americanized dish but it's the best beef chow fun I've had anywhere.   There is a few more but I'm drawing a blank. Anyways this is authentic Sichuan food so explore different dishes because they are GOOD!",

It took 30 minutes for the waitress to take our order, another 30 minutes for the FIRST entree (twice cooked pork) to arrive, and then DH had to wait another 20 minutes before his General Tsao's chicken came.  So we really didn't get to eat dinner together!  THEN, our appetizer, the steamed buns showed up--after we had finished our meals!  (We thought they had been forgotten, and at that point, we were so disgusted, we didn't say anything.)  Our server was very brusque, hurried, and never made eye contact during the few minutes she allotted us.  What a difference from another server we observed, who was all smiles and worked with the Jewish couple at a nearby table to order in such a way to meet their dietary needs.  We have always liked Szechwan Palace, but we think we'll try Beijing Gardens at the Chinese Cultural Center next time---that's how disappointed we were.",

    "text": "This is my second visit here both trips were equally great. Last night I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken (American version cause I wanted white meat) and it was really good. One thing I liked is they didn't skimp on the chicken like many other places do.  Tonight I got the celery and peanuts appetizer. I had never seen that on any menu and I do like both so I figured WTH. I also ordered the spicy fried filet of fish. I asked the waiter if it was \"thai hot\" and he said it's very spicy. I'm trying to drop a few pounds so I thought if it's too hot it will help me control my portion.   The celery and peanuts are stir fried with what I think is garlic pit and a tad of salt. I was surprised at how tasty it was and I finished the entire bowl. I waited until my fish arrived and used it as an accompaniment for the fried fish. Now I know the pic makes this fish look hotter that he'll but as long as you're not an idiot and eat the red peppers you will be fine. If you stick to eating the fish and onions I would say it's a 2 out of 10 on the heat scale. Down a few peppers by mistake and well....You can respond and tell me. I know better!  The service was really good except it took a while to get the check. It was packed tonight and only 2 people waiting tables so I won't ding them for it this time.  Give it a try and order off the diner menu #2.",

Our group enjoyed talking with each other and probably would have ordered 1-5 desserts, but instead we received our bill and fortune cookies. But anyway, we sat and talked while they continued to be sure our water glasses were filled. When visiting here, be sure to check the outdoor display of Hanghou and Suzhou which is part of the Chinese Cultural Center; provides a nice short walk to read the historical info or to sit quietly at the small pond. In the area there is a supermarket for everything. I shop there each time I eat at one of the establishments here.",

They have decently sized lunch portions including soup, small salad, veggie spring roll and choice of brown or white rice. The Beef with Broccoli was just ok, but for the price, I couldn't complain. The sauce with pretty thick, which I mixed into the rice for a pleasant consistency. One of my coworkers got the \"average tasting\" House Chicken, and another had the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce. Not only did we literally receive the bill before it arrived, she was terribly unhappy with the seafood quality and flavor. Her Diet Coke didn't show up till the end either - producing more sour reviews on her part.  My \"veggie soup\" consisted of a piece of broccoli, three carrots and an onion slice soaked in wonton broth. Go with the egg drop instead.  I will mention that we were already grossly disappointed having learned the Golden Buddha was closed and it's hard to compete with them. For a quick, low budget Chinese food experience with a decent ambiance, Szechwan Palace is an option, but not a GREAT one.",

I know this because I have tried almost all of them in search of finding something equivalent to the restaurants in California.  Szechwan Palace is the best place I have eaten at in this entire state so hooray for them!! I LOVE LOVE their pickled cabbage. It is ridiculous spicy and that just makes me extremely happy. You MUST get their Chinese menu (I think they have a different Chinese and American menu for people who are not used to eating traditional Chinese food). Their spicy cumin lamb is soo good. Actually, I've gotten a lot of dishes there and haven't really been disappointed by anything during dinnertime.  Warning - during lunch, I think their lunch specials are only American-Chinese food which consists of orange chicken and broccoli beef which really does not represent how good the food is. Go for dinner and experience the real Chinese food :)",

Within 2 minutes after getting the appetizer our entree came out. It really worries me when food comes out that fast. All the food tasted old and refried and the fried rice was mushy.  The service was not good and no one came back to check on us or to refill our drinks. The waited disappeared and the only reason we got boxes or a check was because the busser  saw me looking around for service.   We will probably not return.",

Despite being busy, they took our orders very quickly and we were served in under 10 minutes. A problem that I had with Szechwan Palace in the past was that despite the price of around $10.00 for a plate (entree) the portions were small and kind of stingy. But today, was very different. The portions were large and everyone at our table of 5 was able to eat with contentment from all five of our orders; the flavor was really good in my opinion. Rice here is free which is a must for a spicy place.  Lastly, I'd like to say that I really enjoy ice water. Some places seem to be so stingy with their water. Today, four glasses. Awesome. I'll be now visiting this place regularly.  My favorite: C36. Yu Xiang Pork Sliced pork stir-fried with wood ears, celery and bamboo shoots in yuxiang flavor (spicy) C50.

It was SO SPICY I felt High and my head was flooded with Euphoria. My mouth went numb. I had this dish twice here before once with chicken and once with fish and neither time before was it this kind of spicy. It really was too spicy for me this time so I took home my leftovers and will thin it down for latter. The chicken in this dish was tender like no other place makes chicken. This really was an experience.  Our waiter highly recommended the hot spicy beef with pickled vegetables. The beef was very good and very tender like the chicken was and it also was a spicy dish but at a more comfortable level.  Portions were large and generous.  Service was pleasant (this time) but you only drink water unless you order a beer.  They don't clear your plates when you are done either.  It's an experience!",

    "text": "Went there for lunch on 9/6/2013.  When we walked in the man at the front desk seemed uninterested and told us to seat ourselves.  We started to settle into a spot but got interrupted by a waitress who then seated us. Make up your mind people.  Menus came fast but without a drink order, we were both very thirsty as it was over 100 out side.  We also had to wait a bit long for the food order.  The staff seemed to pointedly ignore us and walk past our table again and again.  Our waitress eventually came to check on us but was so intent on speedily asking a quick question she started to walk away without a drink order again, we had to stop her.    Food came promptly, with our drinks, but it tasted so so at best, about take out quality.  We chugged through the waters and soda very quick but the empty glasses sat at the edge of the table until we finally had to hold up an empty glass and yell over for someone to bring refills. Rude yes, but nothing else got any kind of attention.    After we were done, yep you guessed it, waited forever for the check.  No excuse for a place with people at only 10% of the tables.  Another big issue:  They have a yelp coupon for checking in, even though it was presented at time of ordering, they WOULD NOT HONOR IT!!  Bad service, so so food and dishonest representation.  And we had been trying to get there for a long time.   At least it was cheap.  Update:  We were contacted by the manager regarding the coupon not being honored.  They said it was only for the dinner service.  Problem is, the coupon did NOT state that.  This makes it False advertising and constitutes fraud in my book.  Its called \"bait and switch\" draw them in with a False ad.  That only makes me feel worse about this place, can I take the one star back?",

    "text": "The poor Szechwan peppercorn used to get a bad wrap. For the unfamiliar its not even related to the black peppercorn, for the familiar its spice properties can be quite magical. Actually the dried berry husk from the prickly ash tree, the USDA banned the peppercorn from 1968-2006. The peppercorn was seen as a hazard due to the potential of carrying citrus canker, a harmful bacteria to citrus crops. The process of heating them to 160 degrees kills any possible bacteria thus lifting the ban. Szechwan Palace, located in the Chinese Cultural Center, celebrates this daily. If you've ever tasted such dishes as Ma Po Tofu or Kung Poa Chicken, then you've had Szechwan cooking before.  The funny thing about these peppercorns is that they're not even really that spicy. At first the flavor might have a certain peppery pungency that gives way to more of a citrus like aftertaste. Though here's the kicker, as you eat them you might feel your tongue start to tingle then eventually go slightly numb. This sensation is strangely addictive, like getting a shot of Novocain; it might just leave you drooling over your plate.  For the unadventurous Szechwan Palace does serve your standard type Chin-American food like egg rolls and pork fried rice, but this isn't a strong point. Id skip those items and go right for the more unique dishes, be sure to ask for the full menu rather than the standard \"best of\" version.  Being a fan of offal and other not so famous cuts of beef, I ordered up the #3 Beef Tendon in Spicy Sauce ($6.95). Fresh cilantro and chewy slices of tendon are mixed with peppercorn oil were a hit. I know that dish isn't for everyone but trust me, its tasty. By contrast the #9 Spicy Cucumber ($3.95) is a little more approachable with cool pieces of raw cucumber seasoned with peppercorns and dried chilies.  There are a slew of dishes titled \"water boiled\" though none that I have tried seem to be in water. Instead you get a luxurious sauce filled with peppercorns, vegetables and meat or fish. This outing included the #18 Water Boiled Beef ($9.95), fork tender strips of beef in a velvety pepper spiked sauce made my tongue sparkle then go numb. Like I said, these peppercorns are magical.  My absolute favorite dish was the #98 Rice Cake ($7.95). The thin chewy disks of rice noodles, ground pork and cabbage were bathed in a slightly sweet and smoky sauce was craveable.   When ordering the Special Cumin Lamb with Bone ($11.95), Id venture to say that they use the word lamb loosely. The difference between a lamb and a sheep is age and this directly reflects the flavor of the meat. The younger lamb is sweet and tender where sheep aka mutton tends to be extremely gamy and tough, these were definitely the later. No amount of fragrant cumin could cover the extreme gaminess of the meat. This may have been isolated since on a previous visit the dish was exceptional.  With over 100 choices on the menu plus daily specials, Szechwan Palace brings a whole new level of spice, even if it does numb your tongue.",

Then we heard their head chef left a few years ago, and the quality wasn't as good anymore. Nevertheless, we were in the area last week and decided to try them out again. Came for dinner, and the place was pretty full! (Although, apparently the other restaurants in the plaza had closed down so it could just be due to lack of choice).   We ordered our usual dishes, and they were still pretty good! The only disappointment was the cold noodles: They were pretty flavorless, and completely different from before. But the Chongqing Chicken (Bone-In) was still crispy and flavorful! However, the portion was much smaller than in the past. Another favorite of ours is the stir-fried green pepper potato strips, which didn't disappoint. Overall a solid spot to go for some authentic Szechwan cuisine.",

I went during my lunch, there wasn't much of a wait as it appears most patrons opt to dine in. Customers have the ability to call in or take out, which I did. It was nice to see that they had great pescetarian and vegan options which gave me a multitude of options. I decided on the lunch special of honey walnut shrimp and fried rice. It comes with your choice of egg roll, soup or salad for a little under $10. I waited for about 10 mins for my order and headed back to work.  Presentation: I wasn't impressed. There was literally two scoops of rice (as if they'd used an ice cream scooper) that had no veggies whatsoever. My honey walnut shrimp(5 medium sized pieces) lay atop a small bed if coleslaw???strange (of all the foods you can lay shrimp on) there was also about 6 walnuts as well.   Taste:  The dish not only lacked color and presentation but flavor sadly. The worst part of all is I actually caught myself saying in my mind (of course) that even Panda Express tasted better! I don't know, maybe it was my order or maybe this \"palace\" serves pauper plates served up by employees just as so-so as the food.  In conclusion the employee I came in contact with neither the food was downright horrible. The prices on the menu don't match the quality of food and that is the sole reason I won't make another visit here. Who knows, maybe in the future they'll make their way to the Ranch Market and pick up a few spices.",

Overall the 2 stars is due to the HORRIBLE service received. Great service is very important to me and even with good food, bad service makes it not enjoyable. I will give the short version:  Walked in, host seating us without any greeting. Waitress was somewhat nice at first- I could tell they were busy, but some attention would have been nice. Ordered our food, and my friend got his food in about 10 minutes. 20 minutes later I still had no food and when I asked, they hadn't even started. Guess it's not a good idea to ask because after this, my plate was literally thrown down at me and the grease from my sizzling plate kept splashing up. From then on, I did not even bother asking for anything further from the ladies who were in a cranky mood.   However, they aren't going to get 1 star because the food was very good. I really wish I could have enjoyed more, but all I wanted to do was leave.",

    "text": "Last year, Szechwan Palace restaurant in the Chinese Cultural Center Phoenix, AZ was our most favorite authentic Asian restaurant. I would have given it 5 stars then. We heard that the Chinese Cultural Center was sold and is closing, so when we came back this year, we called and were told that Szechwan Palace was still open and they don't plan to move!   Consequently, we rushed right over for dinner last week.  What a sad place to see the entire Chinese Cultural Center with vacant shops, all except for Szechwan Palace.  The wait staff seemed somber, as well, and did not seem to care if we received good service.  We ordered our food and found it to be below par from when we were there last year.  One of our party ordered a lamb dish that is completed by cooking it at the table on a hot pan.  When the waitress brought it, she threw the hot mess onto the even hotter metal platter causing very hot oil to be thrown all over the man who ordered it ruining his clothing and all over the tabletop.  But instead of reacting to his screams or trying to clean up the mess, she just walked away!!  We had to repeatedly ask for help and the wait staff just stood there stone faced not cleaning up anything.  Finally, after we complained for the 4th time, our waitress said she would check with her boss who then gave us 10% off the check.  Luckily, the hot grease hit his clothing and not his skin.  Otherwise, it would have been a terrible thing. But, like I mentioned, no one there seemed to care.  I ordered Kung Pow Chicken that had so many chopped red hot peppers that one could not see the peanuts in the dish.  It was so spicy hot that I could not eat it and switched with hubby who can tolerate that kind of heat in food.  As an appetizer, we ordered crab puffs that were overcooked just to the point of almost being burnt.  The restaurant was packed that Saturday evening with perhaps 75% Asian patrons.  There is an American menu for those who like things less spicy and a Chinese menu which is served differently.  The prices are reasonable.  I really hope that this restaurant can find a new home or survive where it is so that the employees can be happy once again and the cooks can turn out the authentic Chinese food we have loved here in the past.",

Dishes that start with an A are the gringo dishes, Kung pow xxx mu shu vegetables etc. Then there dishes that start with a C, this means a dish unaltered from china. In come cases this means unusual ingredients like pork kidney, or just copious amounts of peppers as with the seczuan dishes.   Being veg it took a bit of time to tease out dishes that were meat free and still had flavor but we managed a decent array, however I really want to go back and try some of the more exotic dishes and see if they can be made meat free.   While the food is good, they may have a bit less service than the number of tables need so don't expect white glove service. But at these prices $6-8 for most dishes who cares.",

I spent a couple months in Sichuan province in the west and you are getting exactly what is served there.  Try the \"yu xiang rou si\" literally translated, fish smelling small pieces of meat.  It is julienned pork in a wonderful sauce that DOES NOT  have any fish flavor or smell at all.  It is SO good.  One of my favs.  Also try the julienned potato with green pepper, wonderful!!  Ma Po Dou Fu is very traditional of the Sichuan province and known all over the country.  These guys make it right using the star anise which gives heat and a numbing quality of the mouth.  If this happens, it is authentic.  You will know what I mean when you have it.  Sichuan food is a bit oily which is authentic, a chile oil to warm them, since in the west up in the mountains that lead up to Tibet (known as the Gateway to Tibet) where the winters are very cold.",

You will likely be profiled upon entry and, unless you're Chinese, get a fork.  On my first venture to the SP, I didn't let my lack of chop slow me down.  Since the specials were off limit to us because they were \"in Chinese\" I ordered the water boiled fish.  As mentioned in other reviews, the sauce miraculously changes the way other foods (including water) taste and should be experimented with at length.  It isn't so much spicy as it is transcendental.  On my second venture, a friend snagged us some respect by grabbing the Chinese menu.  We liked the squid with pickle, missed out on the water boiled eel but settled for more of the fish, and really loved the baby bok choy with mushrooms.  It is best to end a meal here with some of the fine corn jelly candies at the Ranch Market next door.",

I arrived at the Chinese Cultural Center at about 4pm, after Dim Sum had ended at the Golden Buddha, so I decided to give this place a try with my Taiwanese boyfriend and visiting family.  The prices were a bit of a rip off for the portions that were served.  I order the vegetarian chow fun for $1 extra than it would have been as \"chow mein.\"  I'm assuming we just received the American menu, but who knows?  The service was conducted half in English and half in Chinese, which is typical when our mixed race party shows up at a Chinese restaurant.  I sampled the lemon shrimp my father ordered.  The sauce was a bit too sugary, like lemon drops, and the shrimp itself had such a thick, hard shell of batter that it was hard to taste the shrimp.  No drinks were suggested; we were left with only the water that was refilled every 5 minutes.  When we boxed up some leftovers, they did not give us the rice to take home, which makes me wary that it is being re-used.  A child was with us, and there was no kid's menu, which was a bit of a disappointment.  The food overall tasted alright, but I have definitely had better (and better service too!)  Nice try, but I'll stick with the Golden Buddha or something closer to Chandler.",

    "text": "I would have to say  that Szechwan Palace in the Chinese Cultural Center has to be the best Chinese Food that I've had in Phoenix & I've eaten at a lot of different Chinese restaurants over the years... All of the entrees were very flavorful, & came out of the kitchen piping hot in a timely manor, The servers were helpful , pleasant, & very polite. Now for the most attractive part of this dining experience... The amount of delicious food the my friend Michael & I got for just under $30 (The House Combo for 2) was astonishing. For that price we got hot  green tea to keep us warm, 6 pot stickers, 2 spring rolls, 2  full entrees, a big bowl of sizzling rice soup a huge plate of house fried rice with chicken shrimp & pork in it, & to top it all off a bowl full of sweet lychee fruits for desert. Lets just say I will be frequenting the establishment in the near future. For all you out there on yelp or Facebook in the Phoenix area that wanna try this restaurant out it is located in the Chinese Cultural Center on 44th St. & Cofco Dr. just south of the loop 202.",

    "text": "Fabulous flavorful, food with a great balance of heat, spice and complex flavors.  I ordered \"off menu\" their Szechwan cucumbers which were fresh, crisp, slightly salty with a great hot oil and many red chilies tucked into the dish.  I added a little of the table chili sauce to compliment the heat already in the dish and it was a great appetizer.  I ordered the Water Boiled Beef ... even though it came with a warning to \"some customers\" that it might be too spicy and oily ... and it was delivered bubbling hot with lovely slices of cooked beef and vegetables in a wonderful stock with a chili oil and pepper flavor that was perfectly balanced.  Heat, taste and a great texture all combined for a really wonderful entree.  This is a spicy dish without a doubt, but the warning is unwarranted as it allows the great flavors to come through and when combined with the generous portion of rice served, it is a perfect meal.  My waiter Paul was very excited about the dish and when he found out I had liked it so much, he promised to make me a \"special dish\", not on the menu next time I come in.  That will be very soon!!  The \"Chinese Menu\" is more complex as are the specials on the board coming in.  I am looking forward to another meal here shortly to keep sampling this well executed food at Szechwan Palace.",
