    "text": "Such a darling venue. We had high hopes that this could become our go to breakfast place. Sadly, our first visit was not great.   I asked if it was possible to turn the fans down or off because they were blowing pretty cold on our table (my coffee was cold in minutes). The gentleman said he would check. He then came back and said they can't be turned off. So they're on or off and before I could ask for off, he was gone.   My meal then came and it looked  great, however once I dug in, I found the avocado was completely brown. So I picked them out expecting someone to come and check on our food but that never happened. When he finally came to clear the dirty dishes I pointed out the mushy avocado and he said oh I'll let the kitchen know. No apology, not even a concern. Someone with no people skills should likely not be the face of your restaurant.",

A unique setup - where you order at the inside counter/store and can sit inside or outside in a open courtyard. The courtyard atmosphere was friendly and awesome! We loved relaxing outside in the sun, chatting and waiting for our meal. This is a great place for a casual date, friends, or even bring the kids!  The food was great! We both opted for a late breakfast - some biscuits n gravy and a corned beef eggs benedict. Fantastic! Every item on the menu looked great and we are excited to come back and try something new! A locally sourced/farm-to-table concept at its best. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "What a beautiful place in a beautiful quiet location. This place gets my 5 stars for having such a wonderful place combines with the either restaurant. Beautiful outdoor space that families and kids can have fun. Went there with my friends and it was quite a treat for me as it was my first time, the weather was nice and outdoor seating was available.   The menu is very diverse as they serve a collection of sandwiches and breakfast items. I went with the morning run burrito and a cup of Arnold palmer. The food was definitely delicious but nothing out of the ordinary. I was not disappointed with my choice I just think it lacked a little bit of flavor. Yet if you're used to super healthy food that may lack flavor, this burrito is definitely good for you.  I would order it again but I'll make sure get some salt and pepper packets from the bar just to season it a bit. The side of fruit was a nice addition, but very tiny portion. All in all a great experience and I can not wait to go back.",

I ordered the corned beef omelette but they didn't tell me until after I ordered, paid, and found a table that they were out of corned beef. I would've got something else instead but it was too hectic to go back up there to view the menu, so they asked if I just wanted sausage or bacon or both instead and I said okay whatever both (trying not to be difficult) then it came with sausage only. I didn't say anything though. Didn't want to. It was meh, I wish I would've just got something else. Because the acai bowl was good, and so was the tuna & fig wrap. But the ordering fiasco was kind of a let down. We will be back to try again, the kids loved it!",

My friend made a comment that she wished the menu had a list of ingredients for the smoothies because her Very Berry Smoothie had bananas in it, but she liked the Smoothie. I waited around 10 minutes for my juice and walked up to the drink station to find out that their juicer broke. The staff stated that they would refund me the money for the juice and asked me if I wanted something else. I ended up just buying an iced tea and she stated she would refund me the difference.   I am only giving this location a 4 star because I have been here multiple times and have been pretty satisfied with the breakfast. I mostly enjoy the ambience it's a great spot to relax with friends or do some work/studying. It does get a little loud in the mornings, so bring noise canceling headphones.",

The last 2 times I have been there i have been unimpressed with their manners.

The Orchard was great.  We corresponded with Linda, the events coordinator, and she put together a nice little package just to fit our group.  We rented the barn space between Luci's and Pomelo's and the kids had a blast running between the grassy area and the splash pad. Every child received a coupon for splurge and was able to choose their own scoop of ice cream.  Best added perk was the guitarist who plays on sundays - she graciously volunteered to play/sing happy birthday to my 3 yo.  It was a perfect day and if you are looking for a place to throw an outdoor group event, this place is ideal.",

I have eaten at the original location many times and have always had great food.  I think this is a classic situation where the company has grown and something had to be sacrificed (quality).  Our party had three people in it and we ordered different items.  Veggie burger, rueben, and the courtyard club.  All warm food was cold and the club was poorly built with stale bread (bacon was amazing).  The sides were fruit, frys (cold and greasy),and potato salad  (very good).  For the history I have with this place i just would expect better.  Manager was not helpful, had no answer other than he would check on the kitchen staff.  Hopefully he does so your meal will be acceptable.",

The service is great with super friendly employees, and they can whip up a mean espresso drink in the blink of an eye! I would go back just for the coffe drinks. Breakfast burritos are delicious, French toast is yummy and the juices are fresh and delicious! They have super healthy stuff and they have bacon and eggs.

    "text": "A Coffee, Smoothie and Gelato Bar that Happens to Serve Food.   I found Luci's after a yelp search for breakfast places. I pulled the menu and thought it looked pretty good, so we hopped in the car and headed over. The parking lot offered plenty of shade and spaces. Looking at the outdoor seating as we approached, the place was super busy at 10am on Friday morning. Full of yuppies and stay-at-home mothers. Toddlers in swim suits were playing in the water fountains at the back of the outside area.   Opening the door of the place was met with some solid confusion. This is not a typical restaurant. Kitchy Cracker Barrel-style gift shop things crowd an aisle that makes up the line to the register. First, you stand in line for 10-15 minutes as the counter clerk takes people's orders, whether you're there for just for a coffee to-go or for an actual sit-down breakfast. The menu boards are on giant TV monitors that run parallel to the line. You'd better decide what you want to eat while in line because you won't be able to see the menu board once you make your way to the cash register.   About 60% of the seating here is outside. Some of it is under misters, but most of it isn't. The inside is packed, even on a work-day morning, so we sit outside. Pigeons hop on to unoccupied tables where customers have left their plates. House flies are everywhere, divebombing us constantly. We sit outside for about 5 minutes before deciding we should wait for our food inside. We wait about a minute for a spot to open up and we hop right on it.  You order your food, pay, get a drink set up and then take a placard to your table that directs the waitress to bring you your food when it's ready.  The water is free, and it's really good water. My girlfriend orders a strawberry banana smoothie, and it's delicious. I order coffee, and it's okay.  This place doesn't offer refills on any drink, does not offer soft drinks, and has a pretty much set-in-stone menu for the sake of simplicity. None of this was clear from the website.  I'm a low-carb eater on Keto, so I ordered an omelette. The menu board doesn't list any sides, so I ask what's available and they let me know that it's either American fries or a fruit cup. I ask for sliced tomato. The omelette was really good, but a side of cottage cheese, some asparagus, or other veggie would have been a really nice option to balance it out and actually fill me up. My meal is delivered with potatoes and fruit, neither of which I originally wanted. The waitress says \"just eat them anyway\" and eventually gives me the sliced tomato. The fruit cup is literally a spoon-full of fruit. I've seen paper condiment ketchup cups that were bigger.  I finished my coffee and hit up the free water refills three more times. I'd have loved more coffee (basic black coffee) but since we prepaid, there's no waitress other than the one that delivers your food initially. Our table is missing salt and pepper - The waitress seems visibly annoyed that we'd dare interrupt her to ask for some.   I wouldn't go to breakfast here again based on the service or food options, or the PRICE which was over $35 for 2 omelettes, a small smoothie and a coffee.  If you're looking for a yuppie hangout with good smoothies, this place is alright. If you want a legit breakfast that's more than just a facade of \"opulent farm\" living, definitely look somewhere else.",

I enjoyed my brunch here very much! The inside is super cute and the backyard/patio area had its charm. The mimosas were ok tho - probably will not get it again when I come back. There was a long line when we got there but it moved fairly quickly. I do think they can do better with having an organized way of letting first timers know how it works. It gets confusing because when you walk in, there's tables, the little shop in the middle with random things for sale, and the counter to order.   Would definitely come back again. One of the best egg benedicts I've had!",

I went for a friend's birthday brunch, and one of the only downsides was that it was very busy (Sunday afternoon) and it was difficult to sit a large party together. Second, the menu is a little pricey, but generally reflects the cute atmosphere and quality of the food well. I ordered flapjacks and was EXTREMELY impressed! So yummy! My friends got different breakfast options and seemed to love their food as well! The courtyard area has beautiful seating and landscaping, so it makes for a cute little brunch place!",

Went to Luci at the Orchard on a Sunday afternoon to meet up with friends, and let's just say I most likely will not be coming back.  Granted it was a Sunday afternoon, everyone is out and about, but it seemed there were more people then parking and chairs, and if you know you're a busy place, maybe look into an overflow parking lot?  I ordered the zesty chicken salad, it was a bed of greens with roasted corn, cherry tomatoes, pablano peppers, black beans, grilled chicken breast, avocado and cilantro with a chipotle ranch dressing, this salad was good, everything was fresh, I loved that they give you a nice portion of avocado. This was a great tasting salad, I will say that. Is it great enough to have me come back? Naw I'm already turned off by the lack of parking & seating options.  But I have been told they are slower on the weekdays and the grounds of the Orchard are cute, just go at your risk.",

So for an order I placed quickly, took more than 25 minutes to get for me to go.  Turns out my food just sat there because the person did not know what to do with it.  Need to work on their systems, as well, get their own seating for outside.  Too much of the child/parent just playing in the water sitting and splashing through.",

I settled on a breakfast sandwich (egg, cheddar cheese, croissant, and hollandaise sauce) and latte which were good but nothing spectacular. I thought the pricing was a tad high too. I sat outside so I could do some work on my laptop and enjoy the weather. It was nice and quiet at first but as the morning wore on the children began to show up. There is a splash pad which is great fun for kids but gets loud. It's a great spot for families. If you are not into that or need a quieter space, then this would be something to keep in mind. The employees were great and friendly. I wish we had a place like this where I'm from because I would be there a lot!",

The patio area is very charming and tranquil, great to just sit out have coffee and enjoy a meal with company.  We had the Spaniard omelette and the burrito bomb. Unfortunately our meal did not have a y seasoning and even with the salsa it was bland.  We also had a blueberry muffin and a soy chai, those were great.  We would definitely do a drink and a muffin again, but sadly the food did not hold to the charming location standards.",

Our food ingredients were fresh and the coffee quite good. This is a great place to group ride your bike too or group hang out in the courtyard.  Luci's doubles as a store with all kinds of fun stuff to look at. You can't miss the place as it is noted with a giant water tower noting the Orchard.

    "text": "I had not yet been to Luci's Marketplace despite its ascendant popularity with the CenPho crowd since it first opened in 2009.  I was also not aware that Luci's had opened a second location just up the road.  And I was positively stunned when I found out where Luci's second location was built.  I grew up just a 5 minute drive from what used to be an old home with a fruit orchard on premises on 12th Street just north of Glendale.  The old adobe home is still on premises, but the property has otherwise been beautifully transformed.  Invited to join my family for brunch here on a Sunday, I arrived dazzled by the aesthetics, hoping the food would be equally enchanting.  If you were to do a mashup of LGO Hospitality's La Grange Orange, Upward Projects' Churn, and Fox Restaurant Concepts' The Yard, chances are you'd come up with something resembling The Orchard.  You can credit owners Lucia and Ken Schnitzer of Luci's Urban Concepts for transforming what was once a simple adobe home and fruit orchard into a complex of restaurants with an outdoor seating and entertainment area to match.  The Schnitzers have done a fantastic job of preserving and rehabbing the old adobe home on the property (now the Pomelo's space) as well as add a breakfast, lunch, and dessert space next door (Luci's and Splurge Ice Cream).  The outdoor seating area is a mix of shaded seating in the center with trees, grass, artificial turf, and even a splash pad lining the perimeter.  Plenty of seating for big groups with picnic tables, tables and chairs, or even on the brick walls lining the property.  Super family friendly and super dog friendly as well.  A perfect setup for the numerous Madison School District families that occupy the neighborhood.  I'm sure I'll give Pomelo and Splurge a whirl at some point, but today it was all about Luci's.  The Luci's space most resembles LGO due in part to all the knick knacks and collectibles you can purchase whilst waiting in line to get in your food order.  Order at the counter here, grab a number and they bring it out to you (whether you choose to sit on premises).  As this is a breakfast and lunch spot and I was right on the brunch hour (10am to be exact), I went with separate breakfast and lunch items.  For breakfast, their cranberry orange muffins looked heavenly (and huge) so I grabbed one of those.  Additionally I ordered a Luci's Burger.  A half-pound burger with greens, red onion, tomato, applewood smoked bacon, and cheddar cheese on a brioche bun.  Also got a side of fresh fruit.  Total cost for the food including tax came out just under $20.  Food came out in just over 5 minutes (despite a pretty full crowd).  The muffin was excellent, mixing in a little tart acidity of the dried fruits and smooth texture of the muffin cake itself.  The burger was also quite good, though I wouldn't say it blew me away.  True, sometimes a burger is just a burger, but it can also sometimes be magnificent (i.e. The Stand or The Parlor).  Luci's Burger is good, but not yet in the realm of magnificent.  Still, a tasty meal in a beautiful outdoor space.  Thusfar a good first impression from Lucia and Ken.  I'm eager to check out their flagship restaurant on 16th Street and Bethany Home as well as to try out Pomelo and Splurge next time I'm here at the Orchard.  It continues to amaze me how so much of my old neighborhood has been preserved, transformed and repurposed.  And for the most part, its local restauranteurs who are leading the charge with mostly positive results.  The Orchard is unquestionably built to last for generations of families in CenPho looking for a tasty, comfortable respite close to home.  The Schnitzers saw the property's potential and most certainly realized it.  Bravo!",

    "text": "Twice now, I've enjoyed the vibe at Luci's at the Orchard.  It is a perfect location for a sunny autumn or spring day, basking in the garden setting, and dining on tasty food.    Parking has been a challenge, the first time we lucked out and got a spot in the back, this last weekend we had to circle a couple of times, but finally scored a spot.  This place seems to be popular for birthday parties, as there were parties each time we visited.   Had the chicken chilaquilas the first time, eggs over medium.  It was delicious.  I'd order it again just for the green-chile tomatillo sauce.  The second time we arrived later in the day and had lunch items instead.  My choice was the spicy-crispy chicken sandwich.  It was not bad, not really spicy, but definitely crispy, crispy to the point of almost burnt.  Yet they served it anyway.  It was a bit disappointing, but the sandwich was still quite good, although it did not live up to the spicy name.  You can get your sandwich with a side of fruit, fries or greens.  Feeling like I need to be diet-conscious, I went with the fruit.  After lunch, the ladies had a conversation going, so I wandered over to the fake grassy area and found a nice Adirondack to bask in the sun, listening to the gentle laughing and playing of children.  The venue is more like three different restaurants, Luci's, some Italian place and some sweet shop.  I've heard the pizza at this Italian place is good.  I've only dined at Luci's, which is a combination store/restaurant similar to the LGO concept - which means you can shop for cook kitsch that is over-priced.  The menu prices are high as well, and so far as I can tell, they don't offer refills on coffee or tea.",

The place was busy due to a bridal shower going on, but not overly packed inside Luci's because there is a big event space between Luci's and the other restaurant! The event space is super cute and I would love to use it for one of my sisters wedding rehearsals or showers someday. The breakfast items are my favorite at Luci's! The omelets are fantastic as well as the coffee. We ordered the gluten free French Toast and the club sandwich. I haven't had French Toast in so long due to my allergies and it was so good! The butter it comes with is the soft kind that melts dreamily all over the bread. It was rich and very sweet so I could not finish it all. The sandwich was also really good and was not lacking in ingredients. It was filled with bacon, meat, avocado and cheese. I love this location and will be back to try out the ice cream shop next time!",

The fact that our food came out within 15 mins during the busiest I had ever seen it was so impressive.

Then the coffee drinks, smoothies and sandwiches they make are incredible.  I love, love, love the mango smoothie.  Then take it outside to the lawn and enjoy the sunshine.  Kids playing in the splash pad and folks having dinner next door or enjoying the frozen treats.  It is a fantastic place and a real refuge in Uptown Phoenix.

If you have children that you have to keep in constant eye on it is not the place to go as the perimeter is open to the main street and the parking lot. The only suggestion I would have would be to put a fence around the courtyard to make it a more kid friendly environment. A little pricey but you are paying for the location and vibe",

Hopefully Luci's can work on that, and we will be back.",

I've now come to Luci's Orchard three times and will probably go back, however not for any cooked meals.    Got the Champagne Berry Crepes and they just were not tasty. I don't know if cooks aren't allowed to use new pans because of how quickly orders are coming out or what!? But my crepes tasted like they were cooked in a dirty pan, with a taste of like bacon/ham. Also, they were over cooked and crunchy.   Another occasion I got the Orchard omelette which also has no meat but again tasted like a dirty pan or oil was re-used. I try to go vegetarian sometimes and or reduce meat intake and using old oil or dirty pans is a no no! Contaminating food like this is not ok.  Prices are extremely high for the quality of food that is being served. I can't say I've had a better experience at Luci's on 16th street. I absolutely love the markets and cool items to buy inside both markets but the kitchens need some help! Customer service also does a great job. Maybe I'll stick to juices",

When the counter person asked if we wanted to order food I said, \"I did until I saw the quiche in the display case, you should look at it\" She responded, \"Yah, it's great\". She didn't even look at it. Then, we were overcharged for two small coffees total $9.60? Really, Starbucks is cheaper and that wasn't even the posted price so I was overcharged by at least $1.35.

We waited a good bit for our food, after waiting at least 20 minutes in line to order. However, it was 10ish on a Saturday, so waits should be expected most places.   Our breakfasts were all tasty and the monkey bread French toast was top notch, even my son's gluten free French toast option. The omelets were really good and we had no complaints at all.

Cost including coffee-no refills $13.72.  NO ONE came back to ask how our meals were or even acknowledge our presence after serving. Afterward toured the adjacent Pomello.  Not quite open for service but during our walk thru saw a few tables with last nights left over tidbits on them.  Prices again very expensive.

My son enjoyed sitting outside after dinner and watching the kids play. While it wasn't nearly as busy as my first experience (so, not an an exact comparison) it was still light years better than before. Food does take some time, which only seems long because with line-ordering you feel like it should be as fast as a pei-Wei or something. Really it is about the same time as your average sit down restaurant. Which is fine. If I could grant a wish I would add a vegan option to the menu, but I wish that for everywhere ;)",

This is actually three restaurants in one area: Pomelo is the upscale entry, Splurge the dessert, choice and Luci's at the Orchard (aka the Orchard) which my target for the evening.  They offer a variety of breakfast options and serve breakfast all day.   I went with the organic, grass-fed burger.  It was one of the finer burgers I've had.    Now the original plan was to eat some delicious food (check) and then let the little one play in the splash pad (uncheck).  Splash pad open from 6 am to 6 pm (weekends?).  I would think 9 am to 9 pm would make more sense.  I'm certainly more in a splash pad mood from 6 pm - 9pm then 6 am to 9 am.     The courtyard between the three restaurants is gorgeous.   Lots of misters and a chill place to hang out.  Parking can get crowded.  There were a few large groups in attendance that evening so that may have been the issue.     This is a great addition to the Phoenix food scene and the Orchard is on our short list of places to bring out of town guests.",

I enjoyed the experience so much I had to share it with my husband...so we went on a daytime date later that same week and had another delicious meal outdoors enjoying the weather and scenery.  The waitress was super attentive and told us about the history of the place. How it used to be a nursery and about the family who owned it and where we could find some of their heirloom trinkets on display. She encouraged us to walk around and explore the bar, the basement dining area and the back where they made a table out of the wood of a tree that had to be cut down in the place the table now sits.  Love the little market and ice cream shoppe... They really did a great job all around.",

Children can play in the water fountain in the garden while parents watch over them while sipping their favorite beverage. Sometimes the children almost outnumber the adults.  Lots of parking. That gets a two thumbs up!  The cranberry orange muffin was moist and full of flavor.  When we arrived mid-morning, the parking lot was well over half full. Most of the tables, both inside and out, were occupied.  So, I am half way through my review of this coffee shop before I even get to reviewing the actual coffee. It was very smooth, which is not my favorite type of coffee, unless it is an Ethiopian coffee. I should have ordered an extra shot or two in my latte. My bad!   The inside of the store feels like a cross between a Fireworks store and a Cracker Barrel restaurant. For some, this will be the perfect coffee shop, for others it may not be. Try Luci's once and find out for yourself.",

Unfortunately I went in last Monday (3/25) and asked for the breakfast sandwich on Gluten Free bread with turkey. The guy working the register assured me they did have gluten free bread and I made sure to double check when he rang in my order. I then received my sandwich and the bread looked distinctly not gluten free (I've been eating it for 11+ years) so I asked the lady who was directing the orders/kitchen/food running to confirm the bread was gluten free. She glanced at it and said 'yes'.   Clearly, as I am now on DAY NINE of feeling like crap, painful and bloated, and have the usual symptoms of gluten attack, the bread was NOT gluten free and I am extremely upset that their management doesn't care enough to make sure the staff knows what is what. Unfortunately there isn't anything I can do to feel better, and I will NEVER be eating here again, I don't normally write reviews but I want to save other GF people from eating here and trusting their food/staff in future.",

Delicious food and coffee!! I highly recommend the Funky Monkey French Toast and a side of potatoes. It is a bit on the pricer side, but for the quality of the food and the taste, it is worth it!! My second time going there, one thing that was a little disappointing and upsetting was when I tried to order the french toast, and the cashier said they stopped serving all food except pizzas after 5pm. I thought that was very weird because online it never said any of that. So then I called the Luci's Healthy Marketplace to see if they were still serving it and they do until closing, so we went there instead. It is definitely one of my favorite restaurants here in the Phoenix valley!!",

An adorable ice cream and candy shop sits caddy corner to Pomelo hidden away behind the bar which features mimosas, bloody marys, margaritas, tasty cocktails and an abundance of craft beer selections. No shortage of food options here. Breakfast is served all day, while the lunch menu offers plenty of sandwiches, salad and burger selections. I snagged myself the sweet fig and tuna salad wrap accompanied with a pile of fries and a bottled root beer. Tasty, flavorful and fantastically affordable! Parking is notoriously scares so keep that in mind when arriving on a busy Saturday morning or a Sunday brunch. All in all, I love me some Luci's. Get on board Gilbert, we need a location  too!",

Especially when I dine in I don't see the point to drink out of plastic cups when I'm using a ceramic plate and stainless steel cutlery at the same time. When I asked for a glass I was told that the only non-plastic option is a coffee mug. Seriously? As a restaurant that advertises to provide fresh and locally sourced food why doesn't it go hand in hand with being environmentally friendly?",

As I walked up to place my order I was not greeted..First and foremost, that is the #1 rule of customer service! Secondly, my sisters order after me and again Sam R had a rude attitude towards them.

I come here on Thursday mornings after a run with a few friends and the food is pretty darn good. So far the biscuits & gravy with subside egg is just ridiculously delicious.  I also love the chiliquias (probably spelling it wrong), the oatmeal is great and so are the burritos. I do wish the coffee was self serve but it's good also. They have lots of room inside and just a beautiful courtyard outside where we usually sit. They sell lots of little stuff too like Cracker Barrel but not nearly as much, lots of pastries too.",

    "text": "Cant say enough good things about this place, It's our family favorite. First, the location is Beautiful! There is a yard area with tables and chairs for seating, or if you are like us, you can grab a smoothie (very berry, YUM!) or (my personal favorite) an Arnold Palmer and sit on the grass to enjoy your treats. At night it is beautifully lit with lights that really give off an amazing ambiance. Second, there is something here for everyone. We have small kids and it's hard to find a place where you can enjoy some food with kids who feel like poking around and exploring. One of the reasons we love the Orchard so much is how family friendly it is. We can sit at a table and enjoy our food which is always amazing( the monkey french toast, OMG) and adult beverages (they have great draft beers) while our kids play on the splash pad. Aside from the super yummy food and drinks, they property houses Splurge, the Gelato shop. Fresh and amazing Gelato with a variety of toppings. The splurge shop itself is adorable and feels retro with a variety of different candies that I can never resist :) The nights when we are lucky enough to have a babysitter and want to get out by ourselves? We visit Pomelo. The restaurant is gorgeous and chic, the food is amazing,the price is on point and the service is always great. They also have really awesome happy hour specials. We live a short distance from the Orchard and it is exactly what this area needed.  It really is a wonderful place to enjoy delicious things, relax, listen to live music and get to know the community. Love it!",

On the site of a former nursery, the folks who built Luci's and Pomelo at The Orchard did a great job with the interior and exterior decor and landscaping. There's plenty of parking, too. Luci's has a charming interior with fun and quirky gifts to buy. You order at the counter and the servers bring your food to your table. The mochas are delish. My only beef? The food's just not that good. If it was better, I would have given it the extra star. If you have a business meeting and don't want to be around squealing little ones, stay away from the patio. It has a splash pad and the kids go crazy for it. But if you're there to just hang out, it's entertaining to watch them.",

Loved the darling store part where everything I saw was tempting to buy.   I found the staff to be knowledgeable and sort of friendly, but not overly so.  Not sure what it was exactly, but just the overall vibe didn't say \"we are thrilled to be here and glad you have joined us\".   We ordered a sandwich and salad to split and did appreciate that they split the sandwich for us and gave us each some potato salad.  We sat outside which looked nice, but we were almost immediately attached by black flies. There were so many that it became impossible to eat because we were just trying to shooo them away.  That was a bummer.  The club sandwich was beautifully presented and flavorful but a little hard to eat.  The chop salad had lots of ingredients and all were fresh and delish.  I got an Arnold Palmer ($4.00 or more) and was a bit disappointed when I was told they would refill the tea part but the lemonade was extra. Really?  After I just paid over $4.00 for a cup with lots of ice in it the first time. I felt like it was baseball stadium pricing.    I would come back for sure because the ambience was spectacular, the food was good and I am thinking the flies were just temporary.",

Its a good thing I got there before the rest of my party because I had to hunt down a table. Its so packed that people are helicoptering around tables that may free up. I even saw a squabble between two parties about who got to the table first. NOPE. I HATE having to hunt a table down. Heaven forbid you wait in the long line to order your food first and then end up not finding a table to sit at. Its just ridiculous. Then there's people who know others are waiting to sit, they've finished their meal and just sit around chatting the morning away when they really should move on and let someone have their table.  I think this system works during the week when it's not as busy, but on weekends, they really should have a host seating people.  The food- I didn't bother taking a picture of. I got the traditional breakfast which had scrambled eggs, turkey sausage, roasted potatoes and toast. Nothing to rave about. The others got the Orchard omelette and chilaquiles which neither of them found too special.  Overall, we wouldn't come back. Too much hustle and inconvenience to find our own seat for food that wasn't terrible - just not worth the trouble.",

    "text": "Ok first of all they have their landline without service...I tried to call my friends to let them know  I was on my way and it was impossible...  This was my first visit to the Orchard, it's a very nice place in a residential neighborhood, you can easily miss it if you are speeding or distracted, they have parking lot in front and in the back, and it's surrounded by trees.  The ambience is relaxed, they have a splash pad for  the little ones, and some tables with shade. They do also sell ice cream and drinks, breakfast all day and sandwiches-salads and chicken nuggets for the kids, but you need to make a loooong line to check out, even it they do have 2 cashiers working at the same time.  I wish they had more shade,specially on the top of the splash pad, it's very nice to enjoy the sunshine however we are in March and the sun is already \"burning\" I cannot imagine June or July temperatures...the kids are running barefoot and the have artificial grass, it was soft for me but my son complained, the paths where kids are walking have some cemented areas and rocks!!!  The kind of rocks that are edgy and pointy...wish I could take a picture but my hands were full... I think they definitely need to consider to improve the place making it more safe but at the same time kid friendly. Also I wish they do recycle and had separate bins I was not able to find any.   Also when I was about to pick my drink I found they have Perrier, but the fridge was broken or just off, so it was not cold....another disappointment   Talking now about the food, I ordered a spicy crunchy chicken sandwich with salad and a strip chicken nuggets with fries for my kid, I ordered my sandwich to go, and once I got home and opened my box I was really disappointed... First no extra napkins, just the small thin napkins that comes with your plastic fork, also no seasonings, I found my friends who ate at the place had for them so I expected I had them included too, nope...zilch  Then when I gave the first bite to my sandwich I found the chicken was dry and burnt..I attached  a picture of my son chicken nuggets and the chicken of my sandwich so you can compare and tell I'm not crazy haha  I figured out the chipotle color added darkness, however no...it was over fried..I understand they have many costumers and orders to fulfill, maybe not enough staff at the kitchen, maybe the person who cooked my chicken was afraid of substitution for a new one and take longer or to be charged for the one they burned...I don't know however my experience was not the one I was expecting, I felt like if I ordered some chicken sandwich from KFC and still KFC would be better because it's not burnt! considering they do also have a restaurant next door from part of the same business, well I expected the same quality of food and service according to the place, anyway maybe next time I will visit early morning, I will keep my kid with sandals all times and I will stick with drinks instead of trying to experience tasting their food, and I will suggest you to do the same.",

We found a table and our good and bevvies came out quickly. The drinks were just what we needed after that 98* hike. The burrito was ok- coulda used a lil more salsa on the side. The chilaquiles were just ok. Definitely needed more salt, more salsa- just more flavor in general. I would return and try something else. We really enjoyed the vibe- and enjoyed laughing about how disgusting we looked compared to everyone else in the place. Hahaha",

The drip Coffee was bland and weak, and I ordered a frittata that wasn't cooked long enough. Still runny in the middle and the veggies were all mushy with no flavor. This place is so close to perfect. With a little attention to details and customer service too, this place would be 5 Star.",

The marketplace serves salad, sandwiches, smoothies, beer, wine, juices and best of all breakfast is served all day! (We always go for the Funky Monkey French Toast). But it's doesn't stop there. Connected to the marketplace is Splurge (a homemade gelato shop that will satisfy your sweet-tooth) The gelato is all natural and the flavors always change, they even have an adult-only root beer float, and don't forget to indulge in some of the retro candy they sell.  Once you decide on some food and gelato make sure to take it outside and bask in the Arizona sun (under misters and of course shade) You can even bring your little ones to play in the splash pad!",

The food was awesome (French toast, breakfast burritos, fresh fruit, lemon scones, blueberry and banana nut muffins all to die for) and the adult beverages were very good. The two person hostess staff were very attentive, taking care of all guests requests and we had 34 guests so they had their hands full. Linda was very accommodating helping to coordinate decor and party rental companies. There were two cons: Linda called me on these two items practically after hitting send. She let me know they were on top of one of the items and I realized the other item was an oversight on my part. So impressed with how Luci's handled every facet of this event from booking, the actual event, and now even my review. I'm even more impressed.",

Got our food within 10 mins of ordering. The omelet was flavorful and not spicy considering it has chicken chorizo. His biscuits and gravy were hot and the gravy was so so..   Definitely a go to place for brunch soon with my ladies and pizza and wine :)",

    "text": "So, my birthday breakfast with David was at Luci's, a place I've been wanting to try out for some month now. Walking into the grounds was phenomenal, and entering the restaurant portion was awesome. David ordered the traditional breakfast, over easy, and I ordered the corned beef benedict. After getting cups of water, we waited on the beautiful park-like grounds and waited for our food to arrive. And waited, because we were both quite hungry. So by the time our breakfasts arrived, we both dug in. To lukewarm dishes. While the flavors were there, the missing heat made it hard to truly appreciate our meals. We finished our food and let it digest a few minutes before leaving. Sadly.  While it may have been a fluke that our food wasn't brought out hot, it has hampered our desire to return anytime soon. Don 't get me wrong, I do plan on returning. Just not certain how quickly that will happen.",

Talk about the cutest spot in town for a friend gathering, mom gathering, splash pad date with kiddos, work-from-home escape, event, etc. Luci's is literally all of the things! It is perfectly located in Midtown Phoenix and has the most welcoming vibes.   They have a large grassy area in the center of Pomelo and Luci's that is perfect for parties. Two of my friends have hosted parties here in the past 6 months and both were absolutely outstanding. I'm at the age group where many of my friends have small children (ages newborn - 2 years) and this venue is perfect for everyone. The kiddos can run around, parents can mingle, and trust me, this is a space that you'll want to hang out at all day long!   I absolutely LOVE their breakfast burritos and iced green tea. Their ice cream is also pretty fab. The kiddos LOVE it. Their sandwiches are yummy as well. You really can't go wrong at Luci's. When my little babe is born, you better believe we'll be coming here on the regular! See you soon, Luci's!",

There is: Luci's, a breakfast-all-day and sandwich shop wrapped commingled with a gift shop with both indoor and outdoor dining. They serve craft beers there. There is an ice cream/candy store (I'm taking the grand babies), a gorgeous patio with a slash pad and a large canopied area. There is also a Mexican Restaurant! My girlfriend drives past it all the time on the way to her brother's house but has never stopped in. There is a prominent faux pax water tower over a nice seating area. It was jumping! Ok let's get to the food; it was excellent, very fresh that includes vegan and gluten free choices (I'm trying to pay more attention to those things for you folks with dietary restrictions- you're covered here!) I ordered the daily special which was a grilled cheese sandwich that turned out to be grilled ham and tomatoes- hahahaha, a mistake? I don't know, don't care, it was perfect! It came with a choice of sides; fries, potato salad, fruit or veggies, I ordered the fries, they were good. My girlfriend wanted an egg sandwich on a croissant. She chose chopped veggies to go in the scrambled eggs (she saw a plate of croissants and-) It was a beautiful day and we sat outside. I noticed swirling shiny anti-pigeon devices that seemed to be working. We shared a table with strangers which always works for me. This is a little gem of a place and I highly recommend it!",

Got there and stood inline behind a few families ordering big breakfast orders.  I ordered a coffee. That's it. \"What's your name?\"  I tell them. \" you can pick that up over there\".  Okay. I wait. I wait. I wait.  Decide to go to the restroom . I come back and say...\" surely you called my name?\".  \"Uh.. no.... I'm just working on it\". Really? It's a cup of coffee. Even gross Starbucks gives you a coffee immediately. ( wasn't a specialty coffee... just plain).  Finally get it and go outside. Didn't realize it was Day Care that day. Not a place on property without screaming kids. Really?  I was able to score 2 chairs under the white umbrella.  Don't you think there are still customers that still would like a place that is quiet and not in the play ground? Maybe this section should be roped off from kids? Just a thought.  Coffee was so terrible. Decided to do mimosas.  Needed the alcohol to deal with the screeching!  Oh.... for $6 each.... maybe you can fill the glass?  Honestly.... don't go here if you want a quiet morning.",

If you order any salad make sure to ask if they can add a little more dressing because each time I've ordered salads, the dressing is a little light.

I really did like the place already and would have recommended it to anyone in earshot but this emphasis on customer service makes them a 5-Star place if you ask me! I think other companies could take note from this.   I'm only docking this place a star because of the little gift shop with kid height toys on your way through the line. I was pretty much duped into getting my kid something and then the toys didn't even work. In fact all of the battery operated items seemed to be lacking batteries. Oh well. I returned it without issue and my 3 year old had a mild meltdown but that's just life with a 3 year old some days.   The food was great. I got the French toast to share with the kiddo and husband got the Grinder sandwich. Both were awesome and we'll go back just so my husband get another sandwich. We sat inside and afterward the kids in our group played on the splash pad.  It was hot, but that isn't the restaurant's fault.   It was fun. I'll go back. Just check your toys occasionally to make sure they work please. If not replace the batteries. You can't taunt a toddler with toys. It turns bad fast.",

I came across Lucis and from my first interaction with Linda I knew I had found the perfect place. She was so helpful and accommodating. We were able to use the outdoor tented area for our event and it was absolutely beautiful. The menu and food options I had to choose from were excellent and they taste and presentation of them was the same. We had a 3 hour event their with our own bartender who also made sure everything was perfect before, during and after. I can't wait to have another reason to have an event here!",

It was 106 degrees today, so we sat inside. Luci's is a walk up and order place, then they deliver to your table. To a person everyone who worked there was awesome.  As an example, my son ordered ice cream (bubble gum!), but didn't like it. They not only exchanged it for another flavor (mint chip!), but refunded our money.  We ordered a club sandwich, my favorite, a Reuben, and a kid's cheeseburger. The fries that came with the sandwiches were great and my son's burger was good too. The sandwiches were good quality, nothing too exciting. We want to go back and try their breakfast offerings. Especially once the temps go down and we can sit outside! Oh, and also to try Pomelo, the other restaurant on site.",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of the original Luci's Healthy Marketplace at 16th Street and Bethany. So I was hoping the appeal of that location would transfer here.   Pros: Beautiful property with lots of outdoor seating. Perfect if you have dogs (or kids). The food and drinks are delicious. And if you can maneuver around the crowds the gift shop has lots of cute options.   Cons: Long wait to order, long wait to get drinks, may have to drive around to find parking (the parking lot is shared with Pomelo), and it's crowded.   I met a few friends on a brisk winter day so I thought it wouldn't be as busy as say a Saturday in March. Based on this visit I can imagine you'd be waiting a very long time when the weather is nice.   I waited in line for 20+ min to put in an order and then another 10 min to get my coffee (an Americano so nothing fancy). Luckily the actual food order was quite fast after this. Once we found a table outside and could eat and drink I really enjoyed Luci's. I don't live in the neighborhood though so perhaps next time I visit I'll opt for drive thru.",

I also bought quite a few Homeboys jalapeno hot sauces from the youtube show Hot Ones where they do interviews while eating increasingly spicy hot wings.  I could have sworn that the price displayed was less than what I paid for but I was distracted at the checkout talking with my friend. I would recommend getting the chipotle hot sauce instead of the  jalapeno. I think it's more flavorful, plus it's the one they use to use on the show. They carry all sorts of knick knacks which would make good gifts. I think there were some locally produced products available. I would love it if they made locally made products a little more obvious. The jewelry was cute, but not my style.   We dined at the next door Pomelo (pizza and such) before heading over here. Combined, it's an adorable Phoenix venue. I could see someone holding a wedding or big party here.   The cashier and pastry case employees could have been more friendly. It was near closing time, but we didn't linger.",

All that and the fact that it's so kid friendly, there's really not a lot of places like this!  With 3 boys, we always have to pick a place where it's kid friendly otherwise it's torture for us! LOL   They have an ice cream shop, although prices are pretty steep ($4/scoop of ice cream) but I guess we'll suck it up since we can kill a couple hours eating on the patio while kids play in the splash pad and grassy area.  We usually finish our visit with an ice cream cone!   Thanks Luci's for creating such a fantastic place with delicious food.",

    "text": "Horrible experience over the holidays at Luci's at the Orchard and also the location at 16 th St and Bethany. I purchased $100 in gift cards and received a $20 bonus gift card. YAY!!  Not so fast,  to make a very long story short, the gift cards had $0 on them. I gave one for a gift, how embarrassing!  The whole situation trying to resolve the error took over 6 weeks and 5 trips to Luci's  and remains not fully resolved. I received $70 in gift cards!  They stole from me. No compensation for the inconvenience and no apologies for their errors. It sickens me to even think I would go back there.  So much for supporting a small business in my neighborhood.  I",

There's a splash pad for the kids and quirky, adorable gifts and trinkets to explore inside the store. The food is great and the whole place has a very relaxed vibe, a good place to meet up with someone to sip coffee and chat. The parking lot in the back is deceptively large, there is actually a fair amount of places to park. They also do a fantastic job with special events! My brother and his wife had their rehearsal dinner there and the outside area was transformed with lighting and seating to create a very special atmosphere for the celebration. A lot of other reviews seem to be docking points for the lines. To be frank, this is not a super huge restaurant and it has become very popular. It's not that they are being slow with food and drinks, it's just that there are a lot of people ahead of you. Worth the wait if you ask me.",

My only issue was the food or at least what I ordered left a lot to be desired.  I ordered the Orchard Omelet. When it arrived it looked and smelled delicious.  My only issue is that once I cut into the omelet all the moisture/water from the veggies was still inside so it was soupy. It would have been helpful if prior to cooking the kitchen drained/dried the veggies properly. There was so much residual water it sucked out all the flavor of the omelet. I literally had to drain it off my plate.   I would come back but I won't be ordering that omelet again.",

Walked into a small shopping experience and went through the line to order and shop more while you wait for your food.  Food ordered, we were given our number and sat down at a bar looking out onto the patio. Even on Christmas Eve morning, people were enjoying the patio with the heaters turned on.  We ordered a regular breakfast plate and I was excited by the Funky Monkey French toast Gluten-free. Our food arrived and I looked at a plate of regular looking French toast. Still not having gotten my drink, food was dropped and we didn't see anyone again... I went up front and asked about my drink and was told that it was sitting at the other counter. Nice, you give me a number indicating that it would be delivered to our table. She was completely unapologetic and said, no it gets made and sits there there... So I asked about the Gluten-free funky monkey. Turns out if you order Gluten-free you get regular Gluten-free bread... Not the Funky monkey cinnamon French toast as the menu reads. All in all, disappointed. Service was not good. I won't be back.   Posted are photos showing the menu GF Funky Monkey and actual served French toast",

I was made whole for the situation and had some lunch Luci's sister restaurant, Pomelo. Alicia took very good care of me and all of the staff was fantastic.

When we first got there the line was out the door but it moved pretty quick and we were amazed that we didn't have to wait a long time for our food, despite how busy it was!   The $5 mimosas kept us happy while we waited and we loved that there is a separate drink ordering counter so we could get our mimosa refills without having to jump back in the long food ordering line!   We both had the Spaniard omelette that has chicken and chorizo and it was delicious!   While the inside of the place is super neat with all kinds of cute merchandise, the outdoor patio and open grass area is really where it's at. Beautiful trees and greenery all around make you forget you're in the desert for a second! The last two Sunday's we've enjoyed live acoustic music from a girl and her guitar (beautiful voice). She started playing and singing around 9ish I believe.   Before we visited Luci's at the orchard we went to the Luci's marketplace which was neat--- but now that we've experienced the orchard, there's no turning back! We love it!",

Well, I don't know who took control of this one but Luci's at the Orchard is excellent and the dining experience is a complete 180 from the original Luci's.   The menu has a list of options from classic egg dishes to your more granola options, plus the standard selection of baked goodies and blended drinks. The little shop area in the store is worth browsing but the kicker about Luci's at the Orchard is the space. The seating is plentiful with both inside and outside options. Tucked away north of Glendale there, the Orchard is a great little weekend brunch option.",

    "text": "Took a friend who had always wanted to go.  Very disorganized upon walking in.  Took a few minutes to figure out you had to order food in the same line people were ordering coffee.  Online menu is convenient but not up to date on prices.  I ordered the Traditional Breakfast which included toast.  I was asked if I would like a homemade English muffin instead of toast and I said sure.  After the fact, I was very surprised that I was charged an additional fee for the muffin.   I should have been told when ordering.  After we finished eating, I thought about asking for a refund but the line was so long and we didn't have time to wait.  Food was prepared well but with too much salt, not a heart smart endorsed eatery.  Meals are also large enough for two people to share or for one person to save half for later.  Would prefer smaller meals and lower prices.  I probably will not go back for 3 reasons.  Charged for something that said was included in the meal, meals too large consequently making the prices too large and the noise inside and out makes it difficult to carry on a pleasant conversation.  Overall not a comfortable place to eat.",

Love the outdoor area, it's beautiful. Plenty of healthy choices in addition to Splurge! Only removed a star on the staff, they weren't really friendly or helpful. I inquired about hosting a bridal shower at the orchard and was told a web address to go to, no one offered a card or to write it down for me. Guess what? I forgot it, as expected. They also weren't all that friendly on two occasions now.",

We love watching the kids play in the splash pad - I have been tempted to join them especially when the temp is over 100. A nice evening out can be enjoyed at Pomello. One of Jim's favourites is the Pork Chop - I have several - salmon, steak, steak salad. Just stop by and have a great evening.  They also can help you put on a fabulous party. The best all around venue in North Central. You need to try it - you will like it!",

I stopped in with my family on my way to the airport at 7:30pm, I knew they were closing at 8pm - surely I could have ordered an espresso 30 minutes before closing right? Wrong. The girls refused to make me an espresso because they had already closed the espresso machine. How ridiculous is that? I understand wanting to get out of work early, but to refuse someone a service they want to pay for us absurd. The girls were also wrapping up the croissants with plastic as I was trying to order one, which made the croissants unappetizing. These girls also didn't know how to make a mocha. They made the experience very uncomfortable and unwelcoming. Maybe hire some smarter baristas that don't mind a little extra work next time.",

Staff is very young and seems totally bored to be there. No one seems to be in charge so it's a bit chaotic. Last time I was there, no one called my name when my order was up and it had just been sitting there for awhile until, frustrated it was taking so long, I went to go ask about it. It also can be a bit uncomfortably warm in Luci's and it is Mommy and Me central. If you have a dark sense of humor, it is amusing to eavesdrop on all the groups of young mothers subtly shaming each other's parenting skills. The kids do shriek, so it might not be a good place for getting work done. But the space is great. The food is good. There's an ice cream parlor with old timey candy, a more upscale restaurant, lots of pastries and smoothies and lattes and super good bowls. They even have a retail area with cute tchotchkes. You'll love it if you need a place to take your kids. It has a small splash pad and a pretty big green space for them to run around. It's an overall nice place and the food is good.",

I would return for menu items, but would avoid pastries in the future.  Not sure if they were made in house or sourced out. If the later is True, then they need to look for another source.",

I ordered pancakes with blueberries ($1 add on) and asked them to hold the powdered sugar on top. I saw the cashier ring in the addition and the special ask, however, my meal arrived with powdered sugar on top. No worries, I'm sure the kitchen is on auto pilot and VERY busy, especially on a Sunday around 11am.   The biggest disappointment was that the blueberry pancakes were NORMAL pancakes with literally 10 blueberries on top. I've never eaten blueberry pancakes with them on the outside, instead of the inside... especially at the price point they charge guests.   I wanted to call attention to this when a server/buster walked by, but I was not able to speak with them or flag them down. I considered going back up to the register but the line was out the door and it wasn't worth waiting.  I also asked for a cinnamon roll to go, because it looked SO good. Except when my roommate got to the middle, it was actually dough-y and undercooked, despite the outside of the pastry being very dry.   Overall, the best part of my meal was my orange juice. I'm sad to say that I likely won't return unless it's for some cold brew and a bagel on the way to work.",

The entire complex is super cute, it consists of the brunch/coffee shop cafe area, the ice cream shop, (what I think is a) full service restaurant, a huge courtyard, fountains for kids to play in and an area to rent out for parties. The brunch/coffee shop cafe area is perfect for getting a good brunch, for getting work done or just relaxing/hanging out. I would definitely come back here as I love the atmosphere and all the random knick-knacks that are sold!

Truthfully, the way a business treats and responds to their costumers can make or break them and I'm happy to report that Luci's goes the extra mile in ensuring that everyone has a wonderful experience here. I visited a few months ago while on a trip to see my boyfriend and posted a three star review citing that I had a great visit but that Luci's was a lot to take in. They responded by offering me store credit to come back and give them another shot. I really appreciate that they care, and since I don't live in Arizona I was able to give my boyfriend that credit and he said he really enjoyed what he ordered.

It kinda reminds me of a Cracker Barrel, except with more upscale and one of a kind items.   They have fun toys for kids as well as fun gifts for adults. Lots of drink ware and such.   At first you might be a bit taken a back by the higher end prices on tiny toys but I believe they are so unique they are worth it.   The food was delicious. We all had different items. The kids had breakfast even though it was lunch time and hubby and I had burgers. They were a bit dry.  I have to say they really needed flavor. Even on the burnt side for my pattie. I decided to stick to it since we were in a hurry and didn't want to wait for a redo. Everyone else's food was great. It will not keep me from coming back. It might have just been a fluke or an off day. Or different chef. Other than the flavor it could have been full 5 stars.   They have a beautiful garden like outdoors and a tiny splash pad for the kids outside. You really are paying for the ambiance. The location is on the smaller side but plenty of seating outside when it's not burning hot.   We will try it again because it was really nice all around. I'll take more pics then.",

Lots of kids, especially with the splash pad, open outdoor area, ice cream shop and various kid-friendly toys for sale inside. Staff is great, they are on top of things and seems to usually be the same people so you know they aren't rotating staff a lot which is nice. Wish the ordering process was a little more swift, but it seems like that's on purpose to give each person more personal attention. Just can seem slow if there's a line, so prepare to be patient!",

First, the spicy chicken sandwich was extremely dry and had no sauce, and the pasta salad was drowning in Italian dressing. The biscuits on my biscuits and gravy were hard and cold (usually they're light, fluffy and warm) and both the yolks on my eggs were broke when they made it to our table. Regular chef on vacation perhaps?",

    "text": "It's finally here!!! We live within walking distance of The Orchard and frequent the original Luci's a few times a week, so needless to say we've been anxiously anticipating the opening. We've been to Pomelo and are looking forward to trying that again (great pizza, but we were there opening week and I think they were working some kinks out, will review when we go back). Official opening is 6/6, but you can go now. SO here's what you need to know about the new Luci's (assuming you are familiar with the OG):  1) There's the food/bev order station, a juice bar AND a bar (order only, Pomelo has the sit down bar). You no longer have to stand in the main line to order a coffee! They finally have a separate menu for their full range of non-alcoholic drinks and flavors which is AWESOME because I knew there were gems I hadn't tried yet. Watermelon Green Tea is my new Summer jam. The Bloody Mary's are INSANELY good.  2) The food menu is different! I, like you, was wondering how they were going to pull off two Luci's within a mile of each other. Well, they did it!!! Gone are the burrito bomb (RIP for my husband, you'll have to make the extra 3 minute journey if you're really craving it) and Turkey Lurkey, replaced with equally (maybe even more) appetizing Carne Asada burrito and Turkey Melt. We also got the Grinder (looks fabulous), Natural Flavor Burger (in the running for best new burger in Phoenix?), Kid's Chicken Strips (we need to talk about how perfect these fries are), and the Tuna and Fig Wrap for me (more tuna, less greens, and fig pieces in the jam would take this from good to great). I am so excited to explore the menu and find my new favorites. See picture for full menu.  3) The GOODS. Okay, bye bye LGO, cute boutiques, and Luci's OG. They've taken it to the next level with merchandise. This has more consumer products than grocery, but there is an abundance of Danzeisen milk (cow love emojis) in every flavor and size. We're talking gorgeous and unique home styling, bath, gifts, and every day use products. Swell water bottles, Coola sunscreen, stylish mosquito repellent bracelets (yes, I own that statement), blinged out pepper spray, cute kid's gifts. I'm not doing it justice. You'll see.  4) Vibe and decor. SPLASH PAD that you can take an assortment of adult beverages from all 3 restaurants to. We went out to a table in the middle of the orchard on the grass in Phoenix's first 117 day. The umbrella and misters did their job! The baby LOVES the splash pad. Ample seating inside and out (thank goodness ). I love the original elements (fireplace) inside building 2, rocking chairs, spacious layout and I won't go too much more into the overall vibe of The Orchard because this place is now MINE and you don't have to frequent it in order for it to stay in business... I think I'll be keeping it afloat single-handedly. :)  Update: tried the Chilaquiles today and they are SO good! Also, tried the gelato from Splurge. I'm going to wait until they are fully up and running before I review. Initial impressions are that the gelato is in test stages :( - the flavors (green tea and salted caramel) were off and too sugary. Plus, $4 for a single scoop doesn't seem like the right price point considering each add'l scoop is $1. I don't want to be penalized for getting a single scoop. It does, however, promote sharing. Hoping they add affogato/coffee/float options and ready for the adult selections!",

I ordered a chocolate smoothie and took a few sips only to find it was loaded with peanut or almond butter. That was a big surprise - not chocolate at all. And nowhere did it state that nut butter would be added. Staff needs some training in customer relations, friendliness, and food preparation. BTW - only one bathroom per gender and it's way too crowded for that. There are many other cute places throughout the valley to meet up for breakfast.",

The place is kinda a wi-fi cafe, a gift shop, a coffee joint, a breakfast/brunch spot, there's even a little splash pad for the kids.   The French toast was wonderful! I saw a huge variety of muffins and breakfast rolls that would be perfect to grab for the office or to take to a friends. Abundant outdoor seating. A shareable library.  Healthy food. A few gluten free choices. I would not recommend it for large parties. But I would imagine for brunch or busy holidays you'll need to get there right at opening, they don't take reservations.  There's parking on the sides so if you pull up and it looks full just check the corners.",

The place is an old ranch, there's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. People were using their laptops and there were plenty of family having an enjoyable time. This place is great for everyone to do their own thing at a leisurely pace.   My breakfast burrito came with egg whites, kale, mushrooms. It was flavorful. The best was their salsa. It was perfect. It had a fantastic balance of smoky tomatoes and peppers.   I would certainly come here again. Next time I know I'm gonna get one of their juices. You should give it a try too.",

The restaurant is decent, the outdoor party area is quaint and the cafe/coffee/boutique/candy/ice cream is a busy conundrum hopped up on coffee and privilege. They need to work on the menu and offer better pastry...  Where else can you get decent fare, trinkets and determine \"if Botox is right for you?\" Lucy's (also by this owner) and La Grande Orange (LGO) are absolutely inspired by Santa Monica/Pasadena/Wilshire corridor for those of you from LA.",

They share the space with 3-4 other venues which is a bit odd. The space behind us was pretty dirty and was a covered with a dirty white tent and had propane tanks and cords everywhere.   The food at Luci's was all very tasty. We got the albacore tuna wrap which was just canned tuna but the fig sauce made it lovely. We also got the chopped cob salad with chicken on the side. The chicken kind of ruined this for me because the salad was so good, but the chicken came right from a can. Not sure if they don't have a grill or what - but wasn't expecting that!  Arnold Palmer is bomb and one of the best in town.",

Good wine sells.  I love the outdoor concept and this will only get better with the better weather.  The folks who work here make the place the best.  The gelato server is a True asset as is the entire staff including the dishwasher who poked his head out and tried to help because it was busy.  Bravo for finding people who enjoy where they work - it shows.  I hated taking a star away but until you have some wine by the glass selection....",

But, not exaggerating, the iced chai tea I got was one of the best I've ever had, because it wasn't too sweet! Instead it was just really flavorful and a little sweet. Perfection.   I'll be back!",

Honestly, the employees are grouchy only one guy who works there (African American guy is the only one who ever smiles and appears to enjoy their job.), the food is never consistent and the prices are ridiculous. We have been coming here since they opened, about once every two weeks. It's literally never the same everytime we come. The portions are all over the place, the baked goods (from outside vendors are also not consistent) and people just generally seem grouchy. I get it's early and it's a weekend but I do not want my $5 SIDE of bacon to be cold, hard and overcooked unless I ask for it that way. Also when you walk it up front and ask the grouchy girl for new side and the cooks are all mad and making remarks that's inappropriate. The place isn't cheap, you can't get out of there with two medium portioned breakfasts and two drinks for under $40. The outdoor area is great for parties and kids (they have a splash pad), but if you hate your job and can't smile then probably just quit. Ps we ONLY  go back because my boyfriend likes the cinnamon rolls.",

Couldn't find the paper menus because by the time you get to the cashier you can't see the menus. 3.  Ordered the special sammie and it was $10.49, one of the most expensive items on the menu.  It literally was the most over priced item and lacked value. No side of any kind compared to other menu items it was a huge disappointment especially at Luke warm temperature.  4.  Traditional breakfast, eggs cold and potatoes luke warm at best.",

The counter service restaurant offers great customer service and incredible food that leans more toward really-freakin-well-done comfort food than Luci's Healthy Marketplace @ 16th/Bethany. They do have salads -I hear- but I can't take a break eating the French toast and chicken sandwich to find out.   Also found within the Luci's space at the Orchard is a retail market with adorable trinkets, perfect gifts and plenty of other odds and ends you'll just have to have. There's a fully stocked bar with beer, liquor and wine in the middle and can't forget Splurge- the sweet little gelato shop. Try the \"Mint to be for Nick\" flavor, it's super good and is named in honor of a local boy fighting a terminal illness.   You'll be hard pressed to find a better patio in Uptown. The Splashpad & surrounding tables is a great space for little ones and their families while the front porch & accompanying rocking chairs  are perfect for a quiet escape.",

We ordered the traditional breakfast and build your own omelet. For starters, the toast was burnt and the eggs weren't cook as ordered. The hash browns, eggs, and omelet needed some serious seasoning. I ordered bacon and ham in my omelet, but if they were there they were masters of disguise. The person that brought our food was helpful, but nothing to rave about. She got us non-burnt toast, scrambled eggs, and jelly. Nevertheless, we won't be returning anytime soon.

However, the issue is that every time I have been there, usually mid-afternoon, there is always a group of parents with small children in the \"grassy\" area CHANGING DIRTY DIAPERS NEXT TO TABLES THAT PEOPLE ARE EATING AT.     As a healthcare professional, this is a SERIOUS health code violation for the exact same reason that dogs are not allowed at this restaurant.   This is an outdoor area set up with tables for people to eat at. The \"grassy\" area is not real grass but faux turf/green carpet making it an absolute BREEDING GROUND FOR BACTERIA.  There are lovely bathrooms with changing tables not 50 feet away from the grassy area.  Hopefully, Luci's management takes this seriously and gets this issue fixed before 1) they get shut down by the health department, or 2) someone gets sick.",

We saw the servers walking around the restaurant both inside and out holding plates of food looking for the number associated with the order.  It was no surprise when we saw them take please outside and search and then walk inside still looking.  I was not surprised when our breakfasts came to the table with cold food.  I must say $10 for the traditional breakfast is way too much for such a small mediocre plate of food.  The atmosphere was very family oriented.  Lots of babies and dogs. Beautiful weather and pleasant tables to meet with family and friends.",

We used to come last year almost every other Saturday and had no problem.  Now, on Saturdays and Sundays (at least), be prepared to wait 30 minutes to order your food/drinks with lines out the door. Management does not seem to know how to staff for high volume times because they have 1 person taking orders and 1 person making coffee/tea drinks. With the amount of people you have coming through those doors, 1 more cashier and 1 more barista would make the flow thru so much better and your people while already wonderful would have far less stress.  MOMS and DADS... please be aware that you cannot change your children outside anymore for the splash pad unless you want to be embarrassed by management. I was changing my kiddo (which I've done MANY times before at the Orchard) on my own personal blanket in the grass and a manager ran up to me and reached out a hand to cover my child's nether regions (did not actually touch it) and let me know that this was part of the dining room and that we could not change kids outside. They do let dogs inside the building which I also thought wasn't allowed... but...   This manager in general was not very friendly when we had an interaction inside either so maybe it's just him.  All this to say that we probably still will come to the Orchard occasionally because it's the only splash pad that is relatively close to home and I love the Passport green tea and patio but things arent as great as they used to be which could be easily fixed.",

We came on a Monday morning around nine and it was not too busy at all. I ordered the corned beef eggs Benedict and an iced vanilla latte. OMG the eggs Benedict was so.good. The English muffin tasted homemade, the cilantro hollandaise sauce was so flavorful, and it had tons of corned beef piled on top. I loved it. The potatoes on the side were also good. My vanilla latte was great also. The best part about Luci's definitelyhas to be the atmosphere. It was so fun to sit outside and let my baby play on the grass and have room to play. I didn't realize there was a splash pad but I will definitely come back in the summer more prepared! they also have super cute stuff inside to look at and buy like the original Luci's. Love love love!",

I even enjoy sitting under the trees and listening to the chirping of the birds. It's a little getaway place for me especially after teaching my high impact group fitness class. This is my 'go to' place when I need a quick bite to eat that's fresh and good.   Their little shop inside will certainly keep you entertained and intrigued. They sell some quirky things and gifts.",

As someone else mentioned, I'm not sure I would have found this place had a friend not mentioned it.  I'm REALLY liking Luci's, from the moment a buddy and I rode our motorcycles here on opening day to this morning's visit with my best friend. Luci's  comprises one of three establishments surrounding a beautiful little courtyard shared by all ( it will be really ideal come the cooler weather! ). Inside the shop are various things to purchase, from knickknacks, jewelry, sundry food items, etc.   I've only come for breakfast so far, but I'm sure the other items are just as tasty. The Morning Run Burrito this morning was just perfect: sauteed kale, black bean mix, sauteed peppers, Swiss cheese and egg whites (I'm quoting from the menu here) in whole wheat tortilla, with a side of salsa. Just delicious. On my previous two early morning visits I chose the Egg sandwich on an \"everything\" bagel with bacon. You can choose from a variety of cheeses and meat to put in, according to your tastes. It's now a favorite of mine. The coffee is also really tasty. I've enjoyed the Americano and a simple regular coffee. Each time it's been a treat.  As you'd expect there's a generous selection of cream, non-dairy, sweeteners and such to flavor to your taste or not, as well as bottles of Cholula or tabasco sauce to spice up your meal should you so choose  The restaurant is laid out in a basic \"L\" shape with plenty of seating as well as a few countertop settings, all of which offer a nice view of the courtyard, which also offers a good amount of seating, trees, grass and even a little splash pad that kids can frolic in.   Service has been great each time as well. Food is ordered at the counter and if you want a coffee or drink it's given to you almost before you're done paying. You take a number to your table and in short order your food is brought to you. I seriously don't think I've waited much more than 5 minutes from the time I've sat down to receiving my food. The staff is very friendly, easy with a smile, courteous and seem pleased that you've stopped by.   Overall, Luci's at the Orchard is just a great place. It's definitely earned a high spot on my regular \"rotation\" of motorcycle meal destinations. I bring a good book, or a good friend and enjoy. Highly recommended.",

I've also enjoyed their French toast, pancakes, breakfast burrito, and ice cream, and have never been disappointed. The service is always great, and the shop has so many adorable things (fart books, glitter sunscreen and fairy wands, anyone?). They also have a super-adorable, sugar-filled treat called a Unicorn Milkshake... best to split this $11 drink with at least three friends who are not Keto/paleo/whole 30/ anything that encourages only eating foods with less than 1 million grams of sugar. I can't speak to the taste, but Instagram will thank you.  Also, they have very easy parking, a grassy knoll, and a little splash pad, so this place is perfect for kids.",

I have been here on a Sunday at noon, a Thursday at 11 and a Saturday at 10:30. Even the Thursday was down to circle the parking lot looking for parking by 11:30. I have trouble recommending this place without mentioning the lack of parking and the chance that you may wait in line to order 20-30 minutes. And when they are that busy you may end up standing to eat.  A solid 3-1/2 stars.",

I decided to order the veggie burger since that is my favorite thing to get at the marketplace location. I excepted it to be the same, but it wasn't. The one at the orchard just wasn't as good, they use a premade patty, I didn't think they did at the other location but I might be wrong! Was pretty crowded there too and parking was a challenge. But otherwise cool! I'd like to come back!",

My friend just had a yogurt parfait and said it was okay. Similar fare as Luci's Healthy Marketplace, but I think the other location has better presentation. Here, the interior feels cramped (good thing there is an outside area). The thing they really turned me off was that a server dropped a plate of some red syrupy breakfast stuff on me and my elderly mother. My friend who was with us said he had not been paying attention and let the plate slip right out of his hands. At least it wasn't something searing hot, but it made a huge mess. He kept apologizing but wasn't very quick about cleaning it up, even though it was clearly all over me, mother and the floor. He finally went to get a rag to wipe the floor, but I specifically had to ask him for a wet cloth so I could wipe off the jam or whatever it was from my mother's cashmere sweater (that's going to need a good dry cleaning now) and from me, and from our chairs. He seemed stuck on just repeating, \"I'm so sorry,\" without having the insight that he should be making sure we had what we needed to clean ourselves off and - given the amount of mess, inconvenience and the cost of having to dry clean the sweater, we all agreed that he should have asked the manager to offer some sort of credit back. I wasn't impressed.",

Live nearby and have been enjoying this restaurant since it opened and have recommended it to many others.   Suggest Luci's buy a decibel meter and determine a reasonable volume for diners.  The music also was not very easy listening music but could cope if volume down.  We may not be weekly diners anymore if the speaker volume just above the inside tables is not lowered.  The food is always excellent though!  Thanks.",

Note to Luci, Bottle Trees or plastic bags with water in them. (It works look it up)  Went again for brunch today. More flies though not as bad as a week ago. Breakfast was tasteless. The Carmel Almond Fruit tea and the Smuckers jam were the highlights of the visit.  Not sure whats wrong here but it definitely needs work before I will be returning.",

I have to say that it took way too long for me to finally make my way over, but it was worth the wait. The employee's are incredibly knowledgeable about the menu from the coffee to the food being served. I absolutely love that you can substitute avocado for meat at breakfast. Little things like that definitely set them apart. This is a great place to meet up with a friend or family, though it can get a little too noisy with children.",

Try to go at the least busiest times as the place gets unbelievably packed making it hard to park and find a place to eat. Having only been there once, I cannot give advice on what times are best, but I can tell you that 11 am on a Sunday is busy! Next time I will probably try 8:00-8:30 am to beat the brunch crowd.   Feel fee to bring the kids to play on splash pad, grassy area and share some ice cream, which looked delicious. There is a fresh lemonade stand and I noticed that a kinds Birthday party was going on while we were there. I will add a caveat, if you are a person that does not have toleration for children this place may be difficult for you. Because of the great amenities that I mentioned above there are a lot children here.   In regards to food and beverage selection, there is way more than I thought there would be. The green tea was delicious and they have a nice array adult beverages as well as coffee choices. The food was great and since I am a picky eater they were super accommodating.  Overall, awesome place! I will just try to find a less busy time to go.",

    "text": "Lucis at the Orchard is a great little neighborhood go-to place.  I find myself wanting to go back but I recommend if you like peace and quiet, your best bet is to go during the middle of the week.  If you go on the weekend, I hope you like kids because the outdoor seating area is flooded with them  running around and parents chasing them.  At times, this can be a bit distracting to those whom don't have kids and want a peaceful meal.   I find the place to be very quaint and inviting.  Except when its crowded which takes away the ambiance due to noise and chaos.  The food is OK.  For folks with stomach issues, just a heads up - The sandwiches and menu items contain lots of seeds.  We had an issue ordering a plain turkey sandwich for my elderly mom who has a stomach issue where she cannot eat seeds.  We were told the bread for her sandwich would not contain seeds but it did.  We sent it back and it came on plain white bread but with seeds in the raspberry mayonnaise.     I find myself wanting to go back and try the burger which is nicely sized but often tastes \"bland.\"  However, I do recommend the Corned Beef Benedict or Reuben stack which is  Delicious.  If you choose to go for these items, ensure you are going early because i have been twice and they have run out of Corned Beef by around 1:00 -  2:00 pm. All in all, i would go back to Lucy's on work from home days where i can go in the middle of the week and it is less crowded.  I found it to be hit or miss, but this place is actually too cute to stop going to.",

The vast majority of the clientele are families with young kids, which is fine, but maybe not my scene. Anyway, we waited in line... The husband ordered oatmeal.... you know, nothing crazy. I ordered an egg sandwich on a bagel. We both got coffees (a latte and a dirty chai).... The prices were high, especially for what you get (5$ for oatmeal....8$ for egg on a bagel). We waited a long time for food.... apparently you have to pick up your coffee from the counter even though they give you a number for your food to be delivered to your table. We thought all would be delivered and were not listening for our drinks. When I went to investigate... one drink was on the counter... somewhat cold.... the other was missing completely. I asked for the drink to be remade, which they did without issue. The chai was subpar, far too sweet... I couldn't even finish it. When the food was finally delivered, we were disappointed to see the oatmeal was a bowl full of hot water with oats at the bottom. The water had not absorbed into the oats. When the husband inquired about this, the employee said that this was the way the oats were when they were very hot. Well... this was not acceptable. We returned the oats and they refunded the money (the right thing to do). The egg sandwich was nothing special.... just an egg and cheese on a bagel. Definitely not worth 8$. I can get amazing egg sandwiches in no less than 3 other places for less than 8$. Although Luci's business practices are sound,  I would not return to Luci's because the food and drinks are just not good.",

I took it back and they remade my WHC without hesitation. Unfortunately it was the worst WHC I have ever had. It tasted like warm milk with a splash of white chocolate .

After ordering I grabbed a cup of water for the dogs and took a seat outside.

Part of the reason I chose the restaurant) was sitting on my lap a middle aged gentleman came out to give us our mimosas and scolded me for having my chihuahua on my lap telling me to set her on the ground then also commenting on how they have a water bowl on the property for the dogs (the bowl was sitting next to two women and their dog, didn't wanna barge into their meal to get my dog a drink). This gentleman didn't say any of this in a nice tone though he was being rude, almost scoffing and us. I won't be returning and it's a shame because it is a nice place.",

Greens were good and the chicken was generous. Looked forward to an ice cream cone at Splurge but it was not special at all, and they had no sugar cones. I'll try a breakfast next time or go next door to Pomelos.",

I ordered the Birchermuesll Moose which was suppose to be a bowl of Muesli with yogurt.  There must have been a tablespoon of Muesli and the rest yogurt in a small cup.  Choice of tea...black or green.  And why does it advertise itself as a gourmet market and cafe?  Nothing gourmet about it.  So many other similar places in the valley who do a much better.",
