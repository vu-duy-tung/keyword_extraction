Leave it to a Greek to build a chain that yelps praise with their highest accolade.  I am lunching on Teds signature footlong, fries and a coke. 7.5  And as I'm standing there John Belushi comes in to my mind shouting \"cheeborger, cheeborger, cheeborger no pepsi coke.\"  Anyway they served up a delicious dog and fries today. Plus I got to read Teds hometown, Buffalo N.Y. newspaper. The Buffalo Bills are 2nd in the AFC East 4 wins 2 losses .667 3-0 at home 1-2 on the road.  Ted's is a must if you enjoy a charcoal grilled hot dog.",

I ended up getting an all beef, a Polish and some onion rings (I had no idea how big an order of rings was). The links were grilled to near perfection and were quite juicy. As for the onion rings, they were greasy and sloppy and pretty much what most people would expect them to be. There is one downside though and that would be the lack of condiments. Don't get me wrong, there are a bunch but I was hoping for a lot more; there weren't even any grilled onions from what I saw. I had planned on getting my Polish Maxwell style, but alas, I could not.   There are two final things I would have to say. First, the food and the prices were great, and the sausages were very good. And second, I can strongly recommend this place but if Lobby's right down the road decided to do some charred dogs, I think business could be booming. Check out both places!",

    "text": "Visiting the Phoenix area, I wanted to try something that Phoenix yelpers raved about and Ted's Hot Dogs appeared with a 4-5 star rating from 7 yelpers!  We were excited about a place that serves up hot dogs and warrants five stars!  Even though they sold burgers and sandwiches, you have to order some type of sausage or dog when that's what they are famed for.  My friend and I opted for the Polish Sausage ($3.25), the BF chose the Bratwurst ($3.29), and my other friend went for their Regular Hot Dog ($2.05).  I read about their fabulous milkshakes, so chose a Chocolate Shake ($3.05) and their amazing Onion Rings ($2.59).  I requested all the sausages and dogs to be loaded up with everything, which looked like it included onions, peppers, a pickle spear, relish, ketchup, and mustard.  I must admit, they did look a bit smaller than what I'm used to.  And the cashier couldn't tell the difference between the Polish Sausage and the Bratwurst.  In terms of the hot dog, my friend was not impressed. He said the hot dog itself tasted like any other hot dog, but he did like all the fixings on top.  The polish sausage tasted a lot better than the bratwurst in my opinion.  You can see lots of spices and stuff in the polish sausage, but there wasn't enough kick for my tastes.  The chocolate milkshake was thick and made from real ice cream.  Their onion rings reminded me of an onion blossom because of their thin batter.  I wished they had a different kind of dipping sauce for it instead of ketchup.  Overall, my experience at Ted's Hot Dogs was just okay.  Maybe it's a locals thing and you have to be a True local to really appreciate their hot dogs and sausages.  I guess I just had a little more in mind.  Sidenote: Cash only  Total cost: Less than $19.00 (You can see the photo of everything we ordered in the business profile pics!)",

The way they are cooked on the grill, the way they are poked at by the cook, I really enjoyed it.   Try the onion rings, we liked those as well.   It has a very unique vibe, we will be back.",

We ordered a foot long chili dog and split, was a great eat and would recommend the place to anyone.

They also have a  great chicken sandwich and the french fries and onion rings are home made and to die for. So good. The only downside to this place is that ordering  can be a bit messy.  The cook hollars at you while you are still far back in the line and you have to yell your order at him and sometimes its crowded and hard to find a place to sit.  If you don't go at lunch rush though, its great.",

Certainly popular, long line, I had a good 20 min. wait. I ordered the all-beef chili dog, with added mustard and onions. Somewhat average, I must say. Did not get a lot of chili with the dog, and chili was a little too sweet for my taste. Bun, plain, out of the bag, but the charcoaled dog certainly has a great taste. Potato salad really grew on me though! Not bad, I may be back if in the area.",

    "text": "Obviously there have been a lot of great reviews of Ted's here. And this is not one of them. I was not blown away by my hot dog with mustard, onions and relish. It was ok. Honestly, I have made better ones. The relish tasted like the stuff out of the jar and the hot dog's flavor was nothing spectacular. Their fries are good, better than average. The onion rings are good, too, and better than average. The place has a great feel to it. From the food counter where you order and see your food prepared, to where it is handed off and they put whatever you want on your hot dog, sauerkraut, mustard, relish, onions, etc., to the memorabilia on the wall and the awards from the mid-80's for best hot dog place. But, I have to say, sorry Ted, it just wasn't that great. I would go back and eat there again, after all it wasn't bad. But I am not going to miss it if I don't make it back there ever again. There are plenty of places I have had a better dog, including Trader Joe's Fearless Franks grilled at home. Call me a hot dog snob, but Ted's just didn't cut the mustard.",

It did not even make it on my \"if I'm ever in the neighborhood again\" list.  But recently I had a craving for a hot dog and decided to try Ted's again.  I ordered a hot dog a  brat and a side of potato salad.  The hot dog was average at best.  The brat was RAW on the inside and inedible.  And the potato salad was completely tasteless and most of the potato's were hard from not being cooked long enough.  Even though I did not have a good experience I'm still not ready to check them off my list.  Although I will never drive from Phoenix to Ted's JUST for a hot dog like I did this last time I will at least give them one more shot if I'm ever in the area again.",

As they were calling for my attention, I looked around over my shoulder as if to say, \"Oh, you're talking to me\" when the cook was calling for my attention... haha, that's something you should look out for so you're not caught off guard if its your first time around the block.  I got the beef dog with ketchup, mustard and a pickle.  They grill the hot dog on an open flame.  The dogs don't taste \"grilled\" enough for my tastes, but it was ok.

If you're going to a hotdog place, I'm not sure why you'd want a burger, but hey people are weird these days. They also had a vegetarian option, which is cool for you healthy folks. I got their jumbo dog with lettuce, tomato, onion, hot sauce and pickles. If it sounds like a lot, it is, but that's what makes it great. Tons of options and ways to turn your average dog into a top-notch dog. They also had excellent fries and onion rings for sides.   Overall, lots of options, tasty food and a pretty decent price. You could have a nice meal for under $6 if you wanted to. That's always a big plus! I'll definitely try to make it back there if I'm in that part of town.",

I got the bacon wrapped (Sonoran) jumbo dog and had a bite of their cheeseburger.  The dog had the snap I wanted (natural casing) and was flavorful and juicy - just like I had hoped.  Tried a sip of the Loganberry shake and that was fresh and tasty.  We weren't the only ones who had this thought, as the place does not accept phone in orders and the line was quite long... but once I got to the counter the service was pretty good and by the time we got home the food was still warm.

It looked great at first glance. The menu has all these crazy options like Macaroni and Cheese Hotdog and a sea dog. They now take your order on an iPad instead of calling out like the old way. The line moved extremely slow as people tried to decide over the new menu and the employee tried to work the new technology. As we inched our way through the line the employees eyes were fixated at the new order screens and were too busy to have any customer interaction. We finally got our food and made our way to the once huge seating area that used to be full of booths. The seating area has now been replaced by cheap dollar shore chairs and tables. Not sure where the rest of the people in line plan to sit since there is very minimal seating now. Wish they would of kept the original Ted's. If it wasn't broke then don't fix it! I'll have to find a new spot to bring out of town visitors now.",

The staff are friendly although they do roll their eyes at ordering a \"veggie dog\" sometimes, but that is probably involuntary so we'll let it slide.  There always seems to be a line but it's not too bad of a wait to get your food. I have to give them props for having a vegetarian option for those of us who still like to hang out with meat eating friends.  The \"veggie\" dogs are cooked with the other meat so if you are super strict vegetarian then you may want to skip it. I do not have those qualms so I get mine with the homemade hot sauce and cheese.  They are pretty good for a veggie dog and oddly authentic tasting. Nothing to write home about, but hey what can you do? They have two excedingly awesome things if the meat or \"veggie\" dogs freak you out, the onion rings and the milk shakes.  Try: - Onion Rings \"Crispy\" - Milk Shakes",

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the hot dogs are fantastic! They're grilled in front of you, perfectly charred, and so juicy and delicious.  They also have bratwurst and polish sausage on the menu I will definitely try a bratwurst next time. My husband doesn't like hot dogs ( aka composite meat ) so he had a hamburger instead.  He said it was good and he'd  order it again. The servings of french fries and onion rings were  big enough to share. The onion rings were good and crispy, not too greasy and fries are good too.   The only downside was the seating. The booths are \"set\" meaning there's no way to adjust the table closer for little kids, and if you're tall, you'll have to fold yourself into the booth which is a little uncomfortable. Other than that this was a great experience!",

Foot long was average pretty much in every way.  Bun was slightly stale and hard.  Chili dog was average.  Chili was below average.  Diet Dr Pepper was more soda water than Dr Pepper.  If you measure all hot dogs on the planet on straight line continuum with the $1.50 Costco special being the mid point, I'm not sure this place measures up to the mid point.  One other thing...$12 bucks and change for a foot long, chili dog, onion rings and a soda...YIKES!!!  But then again, maybe I just don't get it.  2.5 wasn't a choice, but 3 is to high.",

No New England style buns. They didn't even know what they are and the cook looked at me funny. To me this is insane, the bun is the second most important part next to the type of hot dog. A cheap potato bun doesn't cut it.  2. I asked for my bun to be buttered and toasted, again they were unable to do this and looked at me funny again.  3. I wanted my dog boiled and charred, again they don't do this. I am okay with boiled dogs and would have gone that route but they didn't even offer them boiled! Head scratcher on that one.  4. The only natural casing dog they carried came as a foot long. I did order this and it was good. I wish they carried natural casing dogs in regular size as I was not too happy with the price of having to order a foot long.  5. Service was slow, not friendly and they seemed rather irritated I asked question. Also ordering was confusing with all the people behind the counter you would think someone would want to take my order. They must not be that hungry for money.  On one positive I did enjoy the onion rings. They kind of reminded me of the ones served at Wahlburgers in Hingham Ma.  Any case, if you are from New England be prepared to be disappointed. I had high hopes seeing this was a franchise from New York, but then again New York is not part of New England.  Late,",

The Polish, corn dog and regular dogs are good, but not quite the bang of the Italian or All Beef.  The chili is decent, not very spicy at all, so maybe get some hot sauce on the side to add if you like your chili with some zing.  Overall, I definitely love this place, and will be a regular.  Once I have tried everything a few times, I will settle into a routine of delicious dogs and sausages.",

If there is no line I will stop and grab a Onion Ring they are soooo good its a rare treat because as I said so busy normally, Just had some last week as I went by right as they opened and pulled in so fast I left rubber on the street.

It's evident in all the Chicago based restaurants that have a presence to the Cubs fan base at spring training games... But who knew western New York was represented in the mix?  Buffalo to be specific. I don't know as much about the New York - Phoenix connection. But it's both quirky and cool to think that the only Ted's Hot Dogs outside of the state of New York, is in Tempe.  After hearing the ads on the radio forever, I finally visited Ted's for the first time about a year ago. Since then, I've also introduced my sons. And tonight, I was feeling like a kid with a craving for a good ole messy chili dog. As always, I wasn't disappointed.  I have previously enjoyed a variety of their hot dogs and the burger I tried was delicious too. I wanted something different so I chose a jumbo chili and cheese dog. The hot dogs are cooked over charcoal. 'Nuff said. I added chopped onion, mustard and extra chili. The cheese is a cheddar cheese sauce. Perfect for this messy kind of affair!  As always, I chose the excellent hand made onion rings. This side is best shared. They are cut thin and the portion is generous. Trust me, if you like onion rings, you won't be disappointed. Or feel like you got ripped off cause there was five rings in the bag. Finally, I chose the orange cream milkshake for my beverage/dessert. I don't think I've ever tried an orange shake before. It was delicious and refreshing.  Thankfully, Ted's isn't all about hot dogs. There is enough variety to bring me back. Next time, I'll be enjoying either the triple cheeseburger I saw being promoted, or a foot long, or one of their white hots. Thanks Ted's! Now I have to start acting my age again...",

The star here is the charbroiled hot dog. If you're craving a a great hot dog or you want to take visit through childhood memories of NY, Ted's is the place.",

Their specialty is that it is grilled right in front of you. You have a choice of several toppings like cheese and bacon and the normal ketchup and mustard.  They offer burgers, fries, and onion rings which I think are pretty good.  The regular dogs are pretty large but you can order the foot longs if you are hungry.  There are also other dogs that you can order if you don't want the beef dog.  Prices are a little high for hot dogs but go ahead and check it out.",

These guys have to be doing something right to have been in business so long, and the tasty hot dog I ate backed up that theory all the way from hungryville to fat-and-happy town.   I think these guys must be the only people who still cool on actual charcoal inside a restaurant. They seem to have a pretty tight system going where they get your order and start it going so that by the time you get to the cashier your order is ready to go. I did feel like it was a little crowded in the kitchen, with staff kinda falling over each other, but the food came out quickly and tasting good. So whatever works.  They did get the order a little wrong, but it was lunchtime and packed, so not the end of the world.   Glad I visited - felt like I got a small slice of what 1950s hot dog America was like :)",

We just couldn't drink it or the ice cubes. Only one size on shakes. On the upside, they have remodeled since we were last hear. Great job on spiffing the place up.  Previous review:  Fabulous New York style hot dogs, brats, sausages, burgers, chicken sandwiches. They grill it right there in front of you and add all kinds of toppings. French fries rock.  4 stars because onion rings are incredibly greasy and comes in a big bag of gnarley pieces. Also, you can't fill your own soda or water or put on your own mustard and stuff. The young people running the counter aren't the most professional. Maybe that's kind of closer to how they would do it in NYC.   Shakes are yummy - choices are chocolate, vanilla or strawberry. This beats Portillo's hot dogs down the street any day. Yea for Ted's!",

They're cooked perfectly and have that tell tale snap as you bite into them. You can top them with pretty much anything you could want and they have loganberry as a choice for drinks- perfect combo! I also grabbed their mac and cheese and it is just like Stouffer's which I happen to love.   The best part was that Buffalonians flock here. While we were in line at least three other Buffalo natives stopped in to get their hot dog fix. It was really fun to talk with some of the Phoenix and Buffalo locals about how crazy different the weather is from climate to climate and you can tell that Ted's isn't just about the food, it also brings the community together and sparks conversations.  Come to Ted's you'll be happy you did!!",

Just a couple words of advice to the workers- use a knife to cut the GF hot dog buns instead of trying to use your gloved fingers, you'll have better results. Also just change gloves before handling my GF bun without asking me if I want you to :) I think most GF peeps would agree with me on this.",

The workers were nice, but not overly friendly, which is perfectly fine with me. They smiled and took the order respectfully, and the entire order was complete and correct the first time. The food was yummy and we got it decently quickly. I noticed that the had a new sign that clarified the sauce options, which was not there before, and I suspect my complaint may have been the reason for that. I am boosting the review to a 3 instead of a 1 because of this. I would make it a 3.5 if I could. We still have money on the gift card, so when I go back again I may raise the stars again. I'm not sure if it was just an improvement in training or if the workers are just nicer during lunch hours (when there aren't high school kids working?). Either way, it felt just like a nice, normal experience instead of being treated horribly, and that was a HUGE improvement to me.",

    "text": "My review in June just after the remodel opening of Ted's was based on what appeared to be a very poor quality of furnishings. The owner informed me that it was temporary until new furnishings arrived. Perhaps signs posted to alert patrons of that fact would have been helpful and also, perhaps waiting until the proper furnishings had arrived before opening might have given a better first impression of the remodel. I don't think customers would have complained if it took a little longer to completely finish the job properly. The quality of their hot dogs and burgers is still excellent.",

    "text": "finally went. My mother was craving a chili dog while we were out one day so we decided to go for lunch. I wish that I enjoyed it as much as most other people seem to.   Food wasn't what I thought that it would be. I thought that the hot dogs were okay, nothing special and not worth the price---I've had better from the grocery store and cooked on the grill at home.  My mother didn't like the chili and I didn't care for the sauerkraut that I had on my bratwurst. The onion rings were decent though.  The decor is cute and makes you feel like you've been pulled back in time and out East. Now this is where the big problem starts...  The service is just horrible. I encountered four different people working there and only one smiled, another asked me what I wanted and then snapped at me for \"ordering incorrectly\" (like I know how you're \"supposed\" to order at a place that I've never been to?)  and the last girl was breaking all kinds of health code violations. Seeing her play with her hair and drinking her personal drinks with her GLOVES ON and then touching food disgusted me. Maybe that played a role in why I didn't think the food tasted that great...because of the people who were handling it. I threw out most of my food, honestly.  I'm usually willing to give a place a second chance if I have an off first visit but I honestly don't ever see myself going back to Ted's. Gross.",

This time around I tried the double burger, it was good, a typical homemade style burger, but Ted's really shines with their hot dogs/bratwursts.  The onion rings are hand made and are the prefect form of flaky that the don't feel like I'm eating a pound of grease. The fries are delicious and when salted a little and paired with a rich, cold ketchup, you can't go wrong. The only downside is that the lines are really long everytime I have gone, but I guess thats what you have to deal with when everyone wants to eat at Ted's.",

    "text": "After getting tired of waiting for a table at a local breakfast joint, my husband and I decided to jet and go some place else.  What better way to start the day than with hot dogs!  The place was busier than I had expected at 11am, but not to the point where there was no place to sit.  It seemed to get busier as we were waiting in line to order.    Everything is cooked right in front of you on a charcoal grill (with real flames and everything, folks - no simulated grilling).  You order what you want, it is cooked, and then you are asked what you want on it, sort of like a Qdoba setup.  My husband ordered the footlong with mustard, ketchup, onion, and pickles, a side of onion rings, and a chocolate shake.  I decided to go for the mac and bacon dog, a small fry, and a chocolate malt.  Our total came to $21, which may seem like a lot for hot dogs, but the amount of food we ended up with was pretty intense.  Most places that I've gotten onion rings at seem to go light on how many they give you.  At this place we could have forfeited the side of fries and still had extra onion rings left over.  A plus for us was that they were beer battered rather than breaded.  The fries looked to be freshly cut as they had skin on the ends, but they were pretty average.  My husband's footlong was topped with a generous amount of the requested toppings, including two full pickle spears.  My mac and bacon dog was loaded with macaroni and cheese, onion, and two strips of bacon.  They grill the bacon instead of frying it, which gives it a really good flavor.  My chocolate malt seemed a little more melted than I would have preferred, but I think some of that has to do with it being put into a paper cup and this being Arizona in August.  The only weird thing that I observed here was that none of the employees seemed to be in a very good mood.  They were pleasant enough, never rude, but none of them cracked a smile even once.  It didn't seem like any of them were particularly happy about being there.  Overall though it was a good experience, the food was tasty, and it was quick.",

The prices are rather steep for what you get, most toppings cost extra and the food really isn't all that great.    I didn't have a single \"ring\" in any of my onion rings, only small, overcooked pieces (looked nothing like the pictures others have posted).  The staff seemed bothered to help anyone and simply rushed people through the line, even though it wasn't particularly busy.    The hotdogs were decent, but certainly nothing special.  I had a jumbo beef chili cheese dog and a pseudo-Chicago dog (everything but the sport peppers and poppy seed bun, because they don't offer them) myself.  I also tried the white and polish sausages that other family members were eating.  Truth be told, the sausages were the best of the bunch.    The chili was a generic beef-only sauce and the liquid cheese was very plain.  The french fries arrived dry and unsalted, but not particularly crispy.  They tasted \"ok\" once they were doctored up, but these aren't the type of fries you \"crave\" later.  The shakes are very expensive for the small size you get and the chocolate shake tasted just like powdered chocolate milk, which I found disappointing.  The Loganberry shake, however, was very good.    Unfortunately, for what you end up paying for a pair of hot dogs and a soda, I can go to much nicer eateries and have a higher quality meal that actually tastes great.  When it comes down to it, there are so many hot dog joints popping up all over the valley that it's quite easy to find somewhere better than Ted's.  The only thing they really have going for them is a recognizable name and a great location in the busy area of Tempe.    Unless you have no other choice, I recommend you save your money and get your hot dog fix somewhere else.",

    "text": "This was really disappointing, especially after the positive Yelp reviews.  The onion rings were made fresh. However, I've made better at home (and on my first and only try). The batter was bland and tasted \"oily,\" if it had a flavor at all. The actual onion pieces were cut too small to have a good mouth-feel.  The charred beef jumbo hot dog I ate was okay. It was buried under a pleasant mountain of toppings--I asked for \"everything\"--and this was nice. The bun was typical; nothing that went above and beyond the Wal-Mart buns-in-a-bag experience.  I also had a jumbo burger. 1/3 pound. It was cooked okay; medium-rare in parts, medium in others. I suspect they were trying for medium. The toppings were acceptable and the bun was pretty good. The meat itself tasted unseasoned, but was fine.   We had a milkshake, too. Loganberry. Theoretically. It tasted like strawberry, and when I asked for confirmation that it was not strawberry, the staff offered to remake it. Okay, I thought this may be a gambit to save face--fine, let's let them remake the drink. I was told that they'd bring it out to us, so I sat down at the table. We were later \"greeted\" by an employee carrying our milkshake. She slammed it down on the table without comment (slopping some of it over the edge of the cup), and spun on her heel and returned to the service line.   All in all ... I really, really, really hope they had an \"off night.\" We won't be going back, which is sad--all I wanted was a tasty hot dog served by folks who were friendly. I don't care that I'm being fleeced for a hot dog; I'll pay $4 for one if it is good and comes with quality service and preparation. If our evening is any indication, Ted's Hot Dogs has a long way to go with staff training and quality of sides. I appreciate that QSRs are hard things to staff well, but just hiring folks that are somewhat friendly and want customers to come back may be a good start.",

The burger was definitely better than your typical burger. It had a soft bun, and it was served nice and hot. You watch them make your burger and choose toppings as you go. The horseradish mustard was a definite plus!   Toppings were fresh. Bacon was cooked perfectly.   Fries were good-shoe string style. Onion ring style isn't what we prefer but many enjoy the crumbly coating type - we prefer beer battered.   Worth a visit if you're in the area.",

    "text": "Great place to have a Buffalo NY style hot dog. I love this place and it is close to work. Fun atmosphere with old timey music playing inside. You will often see Spiro (now deceased) who is the descendant of the famous Ted in there talking with a bunch of typical regulars.  I usually get a couple of the All Beef Jumbo Dogs flown in from NY with whatever I want on them with a side of melted cheese and some pickle spears. The chili is pretty good also. You can pick from a large array of items to put on your wiener or burger. They cook it right in front of you while you wait. You can smell the tasty aroma of the mesquite charcoal in the parking lot before you enter. Onion rings made from scratch. They have footlongs, brats, polish, white hots (which I call bockwurst) and more. Some of them made here locally at one of my favorite sausage places in central Phoenix. They also have tasty hamburgers and chicken along with homemade ice cream shakes.   Gets really busy with a long line during peak lunch hours. Get there before 11am or after 1pm. Poke me with a fork I'm done!",

Now, I know what you are saying: Hot dogs, really? Yes, really. They are grilled over charcoal here. And the meat is a local Buffalo-area product which the locals there love. You have your choice of toppings, including pickle (sort of a Ted's thing). In addition, the onion rings are popular. Many years ago, I set a \"personal best\" when I ate two foot-longs at one sitting. I was fine afterwards, but probably not the best thing to do. There are burgers and other options, but the hot dogs (as the name implies) is the reason to go to Ted's. And if you are in Buffalo, check it out there. To my knowledge, this is the only one outside New York State. There's just one grilling line here, so on a busy day, it might take a few minutes to order and get your food. Added bonus: It won't cost much!",

Honestly, it's not all that different, cleaner walls and new video menu boards but the food is still excellent.  The best thing about Ted's is that they grill the hotdogs. This gives them a better flavor than your typical boiled dog. And they have lots of toppings, including mac and cheese, which turns out to be delicious. They also have excellent onion rings and fries, and you can get an order of \"frings\" which is a combination of both and more than enough for two people.  Here's the tip for customers, start looking at the menu when you get in line because the workers won't wait for you to get to the counter, they're looking for you to yell your order while in line so they can get it started. However, a tip for the restaurant is; once you get an order figure out a way to pass it down the line so that people don't have to repeat themselves. This last time that we were there my wife ordered chili cheese fries and no less than four people on the line asked her if she wanted the chili on top or on the side. Figure it out people! Maybe drive over to The Chuckbox and see how they use toothpicks in a code to let the other employees know what customers have ordered.  But overall, Ted's is a great place for people, like me, who like hot dogs!",

It's a very popular spot but they have plenty of dining spaces inside and outside. They have redecorated the interior and the place doesn't look like a derelict diner anymore. It now looks brighter and more modern. The hotdogs are very tasty and they have a bunch of toppings from which you can choose. My picky husband always get hotdogs topped with chili and he loves it! As good as the hotdogs are, I come here for the onion rings. One of the best onion rings I've had. Thinly sliced onions, battered, and fried to crisp perfection. We'll be back for sure.",

Tip: if you ask for the chili or cheese on the side, you get more for the same price.

The all-beef dogs are amazing- and imported from New York, where the restaurant originated. There are other options such as white hots, hamburgers, foot longs, and brats. The french fries are good the onion rings are great. Ted's serves Pepsi products and accepts cash or credit card. The prices are very reasonable. The interior is decked in sports fare- and there's decent patio space available for outdoor dining (perfect during Spring weather). Expect crowds, especially around lunch time on weekends! Lots of out-of-state visitors here, and many spring training baseball fans (relatively close to Diablo stadium where the Angels play).   If you're in the mood for a locally legend hot dog, cooked to perfection then head on over to Ted's Dogs. You will not be disappointed.",

Upon asking for a cheeseburger, the guy who asked just walked away. He came back and we asked for another burger, gone again. So I asked someone else if we could have fries as well. The woman never responded just started talking to a guy next to her and put the fries in the oil. We stood at the counter being completely ignored while everything cooked. I realize this is how things are done when it's busy, but we were the only ones. The woman who made the fries finally gave us our total, and when we tried handing her payment she was too caught up in her conversation again to notice. We sat for another couple of minutes just trying to pay. This is a ridiculous way to treat customers, I felt like I was bothering them by coming in. On top of that the food was terrible. This will be our last time coming here.",

I coworker had posted photos earlier this year, spending hours in line to take her daughter to Pink's Hot Dogs in LA. I asked why wait in an insanely long line for Pink's, when she can get better product at Ted's. She'd never heard of Ted's, so I made it a mission to take her for lunch. It was a super hungry day for me - I had an Italian Sausage with a side of a regular dog. The coworker had a jumbo dog, and we shared onion rings. The onion rings were amazing. All onion rings should be Ted's onion rings! Thin sliced, crispy breading - clearly made fresh to order.  My Italian Sausage was perfectly seasoned and had just the right level of spice. Topped with deli mustard and cooked peppers and onions. I could not have asked for a more delicious lunch. In hindsight, I should have eaten the regular dog first. It was tasty. Incredibly enjoyable. But with the flavor of the Italian Sausage still on my tongue, it was a little on the boring side. Truly, nothing wrong with it at all - and had I reversed the order of consumption, I would have loved both equally. My fault, not Ted's! If I had to come up with a con, it would be the location. Nowhere close to my house or stomping grounds, and too far from my office to make it a regular stop. Tempe people are soooo lucky!",

I will say this... Ted's probably has the best hotdog in town. Try a jumbo all beef with bacon and mac and cheese on top! Ok enough of the hotdog talk, this is a Burger Guy review...  The Burger - 8.5 (out of 10) Ted's makes a damn fine basic burger. When I think of a good ol' fashion classic burger, I think of the burger at Ted's. Ted's uses a charbroiler and they cook the meat right there in front of you while you wait in line. Great flavor on the loose packed thin beef patty (almost definitely chuck). Great bun to meat to cheese to veggie ratio. The Burger Guy gets the double cheese with bacon. Side note: the french fries are good here, as well as basically everything else on the menu. I don't know what's going on with Tempe but there are some awesome burger places in this town.   Note: Score is for the burger only. Other factors such as service, price, and ambience are not considered.  Valley of the Sun Burger Tour  -Ted's Hotdogs 8.5 -Detroit Coney Grill 9",

Looks like they spent a lot of money remodeling too. The old decor was just perfect - old pictures on the wall, wood paneling.

The service was really great. Very sweet man and woman running the front when I went through. Super sweet and nice. Nothing wrong with the service. The food tho was mediocre on a Natasha beddingfield day! Like I'm feeling generous. The corn dogs were no better than something you'd get at sonic. I could've eaten a couple of them. They aren't very big and aren't very special. There spicy dipping sauce is probably the best part about them. The fries, don't get them. Get the onion rings. The fires are so bad I wanted to die eating them. The onion rings aren't bad they're really light but they still taste better than the reheated fries.   All and all the place was eh, probably won't ever go back but I'm not super upset I went. It was fine for lunch with my coworkers and I liked my corn dogs. So yeah. Thanks TED but I like your talks better.",

We got 2 regular hotdogs and 1 brat and 1 polish! And fries. I live the burnt hotdog/sausage skin... So yummy :) idk if my salt tolerance is going down but i thought that the brat got really salty towards the end... Still yummy tho..  Glad to eat at Ted's again!

    "text": "I grew up eating those Seitz hot dogs that came in the silver package and on sale you could get 4 packs for a dollar or something like that.  They were awful, and I'm pretty sure if I get any chronic or terminal illnesses, it's going to be from eating about a thousand of those.  Then I lived in Orlando for a few years and became a regular at Hot Dog Heaven.  Now THIS is a hot dog!  Then I started paying more attention.  Well, on Saturday Mr. M and I were on a hot dog cruise and stood in the very long line at Ted's to order 2 jumbos with cheese & mustard, mine also with relish, a bottle of water, and a chocolate shake.  The total was $15.55 and reminded me that I really need to remember to carry our own water with us.  That would have saved 2 bucks.   Anyway, HEY, back to the dogs....chargrilled and perfect!  I was taken back to Hot Dog Heaven and we both thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  The milkshake was rich, chocolatey deliciousness too.  I will definitely get a craving for Ted's and can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu.",

    "text": "Ted's is a Phoenix original by way of Buffalo and has probably fed tens of thousands ASU students and teachers over the years.  Ted's history is similar to that of other Hot Dog pioneers like Paul and Betty Pink, Nathan Handwerker, and Dick Portillo. All who started with just a Hot Dog cart, and grew their business into something very special.   But Ted's is the immigrant story of Theodore Spiro Liaros, who came to the US from Greece at the turn of the last century.    One of these days, someone will take the time to write the history of all the hard working Greeks who came here with just the shirt on their back, to start a restaurant or food business.  But I digress, because you come to Ted's to enjoy the charcoal grilled hot dogs and hamburgers and all the friendly conversation on line. Ahh, and those charcoals are white hot (see photo), which makes their food oh so delicious.    They have Hot Dogs, Hamburgers, Brats, Italian Sausages, French Fries and home made beer batter like Onion Rings (photo), along with Milk Shakes and Malts.  Ted's is really just great food, served simply. I can highly recommend those afore mentioned All Beef Hot Dogs, Sausage and Onion Rings. All the tube steaks are $3.79 and you can take home some of their special bottled mustard for $5.39 as I did.  Enjoy!",

The hot dogs or hamburgers are grilled in front of you and the staff is friendly and operates well behind the counter.  The restaurant is consistently spotless and everyone is very attentive to what you may need.  At the busiest times the seating space seems limited and you might need to take the food home.  Their milk shakes, fries, and onion rings are also really good though the fries seem to get soggy after they cool down so eat them quickly.  In all the times I've eaten here I have never had a bad meal, they have all been good.",

The line was pretty big mostly held up by tourists that were so amazed by the grilled dog process that they couldn't move or speak. I would not hesitate to return. Stop going to Costco because thier dogs are $1.50.......try Teds for some flavor.",

They used to staff the place appropriately to keep the line moving but now it's excruciatingly slow. Ordered a Chicago style, asked if they knew how to make it and they said yes. They did not. The hot dog was literally half the size of the bun and it had hot sauce on it. I, at first, mistook it for ketchup and took it back. When they said it was hot sauce I asked why they put hot sauce on my hot dog and they just stared blankly. Husbands burger resembled a tiny hockey puck. They seem to clearly be cutting corners on staffing, ingredients, and training and it shows.",

    "text": "Alert the media!!! Ted's is one of the Top Ten hot dog shops in the galaxy!!...Ted's is on the Travel Channel!!...Ted's is really authentic, because they are from Buffalo NY, the home of the Buffalo Bills football team (in an interesting side note, everybody thinks the Bills are named after \"Buffalo Bill\", the cowboy showman...but \"Bills\" is an acronym for \"Boy I Love Loosin' Superbowls\"). I learned most of this standing in lines at Ted's over the years (not the Bills trivia...they love their Bills at Ted's and you would do well not to question that or to make sport of the Bills, as I just have:) Why is Buffalo the home of the best hot dogs, you ask?  Well, don't ask...it just is...as far as you know. Ted's created the Tempe outpost a few years ago when the owner of Ted's got tired of shoveling 24 feet of lake effect precipitation off of his driveway every winter and needed to have a way to write off the trip west every year. So he packed up his sausages and some plaques and Buffalo newspaper clippings for the wall and landed in Tempe, AZ:) It's our good fortune, really.  I doubt we'll get the Papaya King to relocate to the Valley of the Sun, and I'm pretty sure Pinks will stay put, so this may be the closest we'll get to galactic class hot dogs. And yet, they're just hot dogs.  Good hot dogs, yes...and I do like them...but just hot dogs. The dogs (and everything that they cook at Ted's) are open flame broiled over a real charcoal fire, with the standard compliment of condiments available (including chili, although I am not a big fan of Ted's chili dogs...the chili just doesn't grab me). They also do a nice job on brats, white hots, polish sausages, etc.  And, I understand the hamburger is decent, although I have never had one...I go to Ted's for one reason and one reason only...the stars of the show...the hot dogs! And I'm not the only one...people do, indeed, line up to get these dogs! It's like trying to get a pizza at Bianco's.  In fact, Ted's can be a tougher test of your dining will than Bianco's...to wit:  * Wait      o Bianco's - 2-3 hours, but you can sit at a table and drink and eat      o Ted's - You must stand in line for the full hour...no cuts!!!  * Ordering      o Ted's - you better be ready or be prepared for a bit of a public dressing down (\"sir, are you ready? Ma'am, the menu is right up there!! sir, other people are waiting!!)      o Bianco's - \"You want what on that pizza?!?!

That better be a hot dog made with sausage imported all the way from Buffalo, NY! Oh, right...it is:)      o Bianco's - $15 for a pizza that I can't even get my way after a 3 hour wait and $150 bill for wine cheese from your shop next door! This pizza better be made with buffalo mozzarella, made by hand, by you! Oh, right...it is:)  For the local \"Best in the Universe-Peasant Food Division\", Ted's certainly gives the pizza joint a run for its money, in pretty much every category:) Give them try, but bring your comfortable shoes and something to read in line (unless you'd enjoy reading 3 week old Buffalo, NY newspapers from Ted's reading rack)...and for the pete's sake be ready to order!",

    "text": "Listen, we all know Ted's is delicious, it just is, so I will basically shy away from the food and let you know about the service of my most recent trip (last night) to Ted's.    Ted's closes at 9pm on Thursdays and myself plus fourteen friends showed up at their doors at 906pm, we just weren't thinking. We have all had that moment where we feel a little guilty for showing up at a restaurant so close to closing time and you just don't know what you should do, leave or stay, so I asked. I have to tell you, the staff seemed practically excited to see us! After hours! It was a nice change from the usual huffing and puffing I've gotten from similar trips to other restaurants. They were very welcoming and chatty, asking about our night and offering suggestions for our feast, even delivering some items straight to our tables. Service at its best, honestly wonderful.   I've always really enjoyed Ted's dogs, last night I got two regular dogs, one with chili, cheese, and onions, the dog was grilled perfectly with a little snap to it and the chili was slightly sweet with a perfect kick to it, and the other had just their signature hot sauce (a spicy relish) and was just wonderful, I don't even like relish but it was sweet and spicy and tangy... just great.   This trip has made me even more of a believer, no wonder Ted's has been a Tempe staple FOREVER! With service so exquisite and food so good, as my friend Adam said \"You simply can't say no to it\", I'll gladly spend many more nights in the dog house!",

Cooked over a flame right in front of you, I usually get a All Beef  (or 2) with chili & cheese and crispy fries made the same way. Their chili is so tasty, it makes you want to send to a chemist to get the recipe. The rush's run at different times, too, so be prepared to wait for your dog, it's worth it.

Our order was taken and we got to the part were they top your order I noticed they put BBQ sauce on my no sauce chicken sandwich. I didn't want to hold up the long line to ask for a replacement.  THE MAIN REASON FOR THE ONE STAR RATING   I tasted my iced tea and I am not certain what they filled my cup with? I didn't see bubbles for soda but it didn't taste like iced tea but the color was sort of dark. I asked my husband to taste it and he couldn't tell me what it was either. I think it might have been a mix of iced tea and diet soda syrup. I did NOT drink it and took a few sips of my husbands soda. If I can't trust them to give me iced tea that is a problem.   The hot dog is extra fatty and greasy, the BBq chicken sandwich is overpowered with sauce and grizzle. Also  The onion rings were a bag of greasy unseasoned crumbs with only a few pieces of onion.   I know most people Love Ted's and they are most likely OK most of the time so give them a try!",

The onion rings were fresh, but super greasy and the batter had no flavor at all.  A little salt would have done wonders, and I rarely put salt on anything.  I even like my french fries unsalted.

There is one downside, and I considered whether it rated a four star or a five-star because of this. The lines can be really really long if you go during normal meal times. Their system for ordering cooking and paying for food is just not very efficient. If you know that going in it's no big deal. Obviously even knowing this I decided they were worth five stars.",

Now to know a NY Hot, you have to know that they are best served char broiled. The flavor is fantastic. Then you must know that they have regular hots, polish sausage and even burgers. If you are from NY state you know the White hot is the NY state secret. Everything at Ted's is tasty. The onion rings are good and the milkshakes are delicious. This is the only restaurant that Ted's has in Arizona, they have 6 or more locations in Buffalo, NY.

    "text": "We've heard a lot of good things about Ted's. In truth right now with 2 total visits they are inconsistent. The first visit was pretty great. Hence why we decided to go again. Unfortunately, the second visit was a disappointment. We both had a Braughtwurst and a All-Beef Jumbo. All-in-all they were just okay. We as much as anyone like the charcoal grill sausages but we still like to taste the meat; the sausages were just way over grilled and their strongest flavor was charcoal. One other disappointment is the fries; they're great if you do not also have the onion rings in same visit. This is a problem because you will quickly be able to tell that they fry the potatoes and the rings in same oil. If you're allergic to one or the other don't get either.",

I wasn't a fan of their white hots, however I can't fault them, as I've never had them before. I may just hate veal! Their regular hot dogs and brats are spot on, and tasty. The onion rings are hand made, and are also pretty tasty. If you do stop by, make sure to get a chocolate milk shake. It's one of the best in the valley (trust me, i'm fat!). The service is not amazing, better than McDonalds, and not as personal as a sit down restaurant. They're definitely trained to get you through the line as quickly as possible. It's worth stopping by to try, as it's pretty unique in the valley.",

UNIX has the philosophy of: \"Do One Thing and Do It Well.\"  I guarantee you they stole that from Ted's as Ted's has been doing that since 1927, and UNIX only since '69.  They charcoal broil their dogs, which gives them an awesome flavour.  I have never been disappointed by a trip to Ted's, and I bet you won't be either.

It was pretty damn good.  One thing though, if they're going to serve quality hot dogs and bratwursts, they should really offer something better than that yellow French's mustard to put on it. You don't drink a screw-cap wine when you have a good meal, and you shouldn't put that kiddie mustard on a good brat. This place will be strictly 'to go' orders for me, and I'll use the good German mustard in my fridge.",

I ate about a 1/4 of it...and am still slightly hungry. The bun was too crusty, they drowned it in ketchup so much that the bun was breaking at the bottom where it joined.  ...That and some of the customers were just...RUDE. I got shoved out of the way by granny with a terrible bun on the top of her head. I had to curb my initial reaction of pulling out my scissors to cut it. I CUT YOU!  We were also getting the stink eye from someone who had ZERO rights to be giving us that kind of glare with her robin's egg blue eyeshadow. She was so 70s that she's just barely back in style...and failed in her attempt at putting on her black cake eyeliner like Cleopatra. I guess these people were hungry or something...but no need to knock me over and shove my husband in your bid to get the hot dawg in yer tummy!  Rudeness and oddball people aside, I found the actual workers extremely friendly and courteous -- that made the whole experience a lot more redeeming. I loooved their fries. Best damn fries I've ever had. They made up for that mess of a hot dog. Hubby had the onion rings. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOH.MY&s=e51333289de4d89694c660117daae82bcacef02fb0bc5ff261a720d9db5b7652\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OH.MY</a>.GOD.

Maybe I'll try it again, but I'll make sure to go when the freaks aren't out..  For now, Ted's gets 3 stars. I'd have given them 2, but they serve Pepsi (woot!!!) and their fries and onion rings gave me happy tummy, even if their hot dogs fell short of what I was expecting...",

If you're nodding your head, you'd like Ted's.  What do you need to know about a hot dog restaurant?  Well, first you need to know what you want.  I've seen people walk in the door and immediately be asked, \"what are you having sir?\"  In addition to regular hotdogs, they've got footlongs, jumbo all-beef, white hots (veal & pork), bratwurst, polish sausage, italian sausage, and burgers.  You also need to know what you want on it- and this place has lots of options.  Ketchup, mustard, hot sauce (sweet and peppery), onions, relish, dill pickle spears, pickled peppers and onions, sauerkraut, chili, and nacho cheese are all available.  But the most important thing you have to know is that they ONLY TAKE CASH.  If you screw up and order food without having the green to pay for it, they might hold it for you while you run a quarter-mile across the parking lot to the ATM.  But wouldn't you rather just be part of the cool crowd who can read the giant signs on the doors that read \"CASH ONLY\"?",

Ted's is so good that Z's Chicago dog opened across the street and lasted all of three months as nobody went.

Especially when the reviews for the onion rings were so good as well. We currently live in Maricopa, AZ about 35 min drive from Ted's so we were really hoping it would be worth the drive. We were disappointed. We ordered 8 of the regular dogs, I had chili, mustard, and onions on mine. The wife and kids had just ketchup. We also ordered onion rings and a strawberry shake. The dogs themselves sure did look good when they were being cooked. I love dogs cooked on a grill and these ones were nice and crispy on the outside. But the four of us all gave them thumbs down for flavor. Very bland. Not even salt. My chili sauce was the worst I have ever had. It tasted more like tomato paste that I use as an ingredient in spaghetti sauce. The onion \"rings\" were more like \"fragments\" with them looking like scraps that were swept up off the floor. Very overcooked with very little actual onion inside because they were burned up or something. The milk shake was OK flavor, but was in like a 6 oz cup or something. Seemed way overpriced as everything else. I could not even finish my hotdogs which is probably a first in my lifetime. And it is very rare that our whole family agrees that a place is no good. The place did look kinda retro cool inside and was doing great business. But we will not be back. Oh, also the people working there looked like they were employees of a funeral home rather than fun themed hot dog joint. Total cost for 8 dogs, a powerade, strawberry shake and the order of onion \"fragments\" was almost $37! Ridiculous.",

Something about deep-frying a hot dog until it splits open, bursting forth with flavor and cholesterol, really does it for me.  In lieu of that, Ted's is a good quality hot dog place with unique, charbroiled-tasting hot dogs. They hail from Buffalo, New York and the line often wraps around the front area near the grill, where you shout out your order to the current grillmaster, similar to Chuckbox when it's busy.  The highlight is almost certainly their incredibly onion rings. They serve huge portions for decent prices and everything is always fresh and tasty. (Spent $8.15 for a large iced tea, all-beef hot dog, and onion rings.) The onion rings are more of a torn apart onion blossom than the traditional rings--an approach I much prefer. There are plenty of sides and toppings you can request as well, from cheese to chili to onions, 'kraut, ketchup, mustard, and all the other basics.  Overall a pleasant experience and a unique flavor. Worthwhile if you're looking for a damn good hot dog. (And they take credit cards now, after many years of holding out as cash only!)",

I arrived after 1 and there was a healthy line with one of the employees taking our order as we stood.   I decided to get their veggie dog, fries with cheese, and a chocolate milkshake. Don't worry, I worked it off this morning. It took about 15 min to get through the line and when I got to the front, I chose my toppings and added ketchup, mustard, onions, jalapenos, hot sauce and a pickle. There's a self-serve station with additional ketchup, utensils, napkins and drinks.  My hot dog was teeny compared to the other sausages! I read that in a review and how someone ordered two, should've done the same. The dog was good, the cheese container I got had so much in it! So I ate it with my fries and also dunked my hot dog in it. Lol. I appreciated the amount of cheese, it was tasty. The milkshake was way too sweet for me, which I should've anticipated but I was feeling particularly gluttonous so I had to complete the trifecta.  They keep this place clean, there were two employees cleaning up around the tables when I ate. People were nice and although it wasn't fast (speedy) food, I enjoyed it. I'd upgrade to two hot dogs and a large fries with the cheese next time.",

But, the fella is a bit of a wiener fiend and told me he loved Ted's when he was at ASU. I'm not usually big on hot dogs, but we decided we'd give it a shot after we found out that they offer gluten-free buns for him.   We arrived at around 12:30 pm on a Saturday--our bad call, since it was prime lunch time. The wait was about half an hour from the time I walked in to when I walked out with our food in hand. The set up was super confusing for a first timer; the line wrapped all around the dining area basically, and the grill chef was asking for orders far down the line so there was a ton of shouting over other people's heads. It was overwhelming.   I had a regular hotdog with mac and cheese and the split onion rings/fries. The hotdog was fine, a touch burned. The Mac and cheese was fine, a touch mushy. The bun was fine. The exact potato buns I buy at the grocery store, actually. The onion rings were fine. The fries were pretty good, nice and crispy while still potatoey. We also had the loganberry juice which was basically just extra sweet Kool Aid.   Fella had a polish sausage and a regular hot dog, both on the gluten-free bun. He said he liked the hot dog more than the polish, but both were just fine. The buns, he said, were pretty awful. Also, when I was ordering the gluten-free buns, the employee behind the counter seemed pretty irritated that he had to go grab them separately. I appreciate that they offer them as an option, but why even bother if your workers are gonna be sassy about getting them?   Everything came out to about $25, which seems really steep for some mediocre hot dogs. But don't make the mistake of saying \"it's just a hot dog\" inside--the other patrons will get REALLY upset about it and let loose a few profanities.",

This was a place I grew up going to, even asked for it to be my birthday meal a couple years.  The dogs/burgers are top notch and cooked just right. The topping choices are abundant. The sides are simply delicious. Etc etc. Damn great and honest food.  Just go grab a Ted's dog. You won't regret it.",

I also had the Italian sausage with peppers & onions. The sausage was good and priced right I find. I never heard of a white hot hotdog so I will come back to try that when I'm in the area and maybe get another Italian sausage. I'm not sure why people complain about service it's a basic fast food place. Appears they cook everything to order so that is nice and a plus. I didn't notice any issues with service as I also went around lunch. Reason I gave 4 out of 5 is the hotdog being basic and overpriced. The hotdog was good just not worth the price.",

They always have a long line, sometimes out the door it's so long, but don't worry it moves fast!   What I love most about this place is the food is always gonna be fresh! I have never came here and received cold anything except for a drink or a milkshake!   The staff is efficient and effective, and there is an order to the maddness behind the counter!   Everytime I am here I always get some type of hotdog, they are always cooked to perfection with a slight crisp to the outside of the hotdog. The flavor profile is out of this world you can make a million and one different types of combinations.   The fries and the onion rings are always good as well, I have never once had a bad experience at Ted's. Inside the restaurant is always clean and tidy, and the atmosphere is nice. I recommend if you're ever on this side of town to try this place! You will love it!",

The only downside of this is that it takes a little longer.  They also use the same utensils for the toppings (lettuce, onion, pickle, etc.) instead of one for each which I thought was a little strange.  It's definitely just personal preference but I don't like that.    Prices are definitely reasonable for what you get.  My husband got a regular cheeseburger and a chili cheese dog, I got a bacon cheeseburger, my son got a kids meal, and we got onion rings to share.  My husband said the hot dog was perfectly grilled and juicy.  My son (who is very picky) also liked his and the amount of fries you get for the kids meal is massive.  My bacon was a tad overdone but my burger was PERFECT.  Love the taste of a nicely grilled burger like that.  The onion rings are thrown in  bag in bits so they aren't much to look at, but the taste is to die for.    We ate inside and it was very clean.  I would go back again for sure.",

No drink refills and slightly pricey but worth it if you are in the neighborhood and want the great hot dog experience. If you are expecting something other than a great hot dog with a grilled smoked flavor than this may not be your place. It's not magic or new. The beauty is in the simplicity of a charred dog.  The stand outs are the white hot (veal) and and chili cheese dogs. I never remember the onion rings being this good so split a order with someone. Also they have lots of toppings so take advantage of that. I love kraut and peppers and they are no extra charge.",

I opted for the Italian sausage dog with mustard and chopped onions.  The dog had a good snap to it and was very flavorful.  Would have liked the mustard to have a little more kick, but it was good.  Also had a side of onion rings - overall, they were fresh but didn't have the crispness that I was expecting.  Very clean place and the line moves fast.  Will come back when I have a hot dog craving.",

    "text": "These are hot dogs. Even the best hot dog on earth can't possibly be as good as, say, the median cheeseburger. And yes, you can get a cheeseburger at Ted's for a buck or two more, and they aren't awful. You can get lots of things that aren't awful. You can also get non-awful hot dogs by grilling them yourself at $1.25 for an eight-pack.  Usually the onion rings are good. Disclaimer - I used to work at Ted's. As a starting employee, I wasn't even allowed to know what was in the onion ring batter. All I knew was that making them involved someone dressing up in a garbage bag, ostensibly to keep from getting covered in batter. Anywho, this time around, the onion rings weren't even cooked through.   This, despite the grill man's comment that the girl running the fryer was the best they had.   That's saying something. Kids would walk out on the job when they got put on fryer. It's a lot to handle, and you go home with a millimeter of reduced fry oil coating all parts of your body. Even the orifices. Especially the orifices.   So then, there is also a strange and outdated system of customer service that certainly requires more labor than is necessary. You'll see.",

Foot long hot dog was expertly cooked and tasted wonderful but overwhelmed by a too big bun.  Onion rings were superb until you got under the first layer and then they were like onion \"pieces\" and not fresh at all.  Chocolate shake excellent.  My biggest gripe is a twenty+ customer line being serviced by one guy on the grill and one guy fixing the hot dogs who was working at a snail's pace.  Nice memories but who knows if I'll be back.",

Maybe it's the meat from Upstate New York or the mesquite charcoal they use or a combination of both but they are darn good. After they finish cooking them you can put pretty much put anything on them. Their fries and onion rings are also really good. The workers are friendly the place is clean and even though they may be busy, which is a lot the line goes quickly and you get your food fast. Just heard there are coming out to Gilbert in the fall.

In there email this month there is a coupon for a free regular dog with the purchase of a grilled item and a drink. Anyway...  We came for dinner one night (National Hot Dog Day to be exact...no deals though) and we got there early enough that the line wasn't long at all. If you have never been, be prepared to wait in line. It usually moves fast enough but this isn't the place you want to go when you are in a time crunch.  I usually get the all beef, but I got a regular dog this time. It was a a decent dog but I will be switching back the all beef. My hubby got a foot long. We shared an order of onion rings (but I'm sure I could have eaten one order to myself). They are the onion sting type, crunchy and wonderful.  We ordered a couple kids meals with corn dogs and fries. Everything is made fresh so if you go the corn dog route with your kids be warmed that they are fresh out of the fryer and you will need to let them cool. Kid's meals come with a drink and the hubby and I shared a regular drink. Our total came to just over $20. Refills on drinks are .25.  It's nice to have a little piece of New York in Tempe...I just wish I made it there more often.",

    "text": "Every week, I try a new restaurant. Today work was extremely slow, and I found myself on Broadway. I thought why not  give Ted's a try. New to Arizona, I am on a quest to find the best Chili Dog in Phoenix and the surrounding area. It is with a heavy heart, that I say, Ted's doesn't have the best. I would rate his Chili Cheese Dog, perhaps somewhere in my top 20, but certainly not the best.   First and foremost I'll begin with this; the service was lacking. Having been in the restaurant business for many years, my expectations are high. Upon walking in, (9:30 pm), I'm not greeted. I took initiative and greeted the grill girl. I explained that its my first time eating there. I then asked about the Chili Cheese Dog. The menu said it was $4.49. \"What do I get for $4.49?\" She then said I can have whatever I want. Right, but, you have various types of hotdogs, what kind do I get for that price? \" Um you can get all beef, I guess, and a foot-long. Or the regular.\" So for $4.49, I could choose either size hotdog, any type I want? \"Um... yeah but they're different prices.\" Ok... forget it. I'll have the All Beef Chili Cheese Dog. \"So you want chili on it?\"   There's more but I'll spare you the entire conversation. I felt like the teenyboppers had very little to offer, in terms of hospitality, knowledge of the menu, or charisma. I like to feel welcomed and when I mention I'm new, I'd like someone to volunteer some popular sellers, or a personal choice. Recommend a menu item to me. Hype it up , make my mouth water, get me just as excited as you are. Nope... Not here.   Food quality was pretty good. I ordered the... well I mentioned it already. I added the onion rings and a small soft drink. They offer no free refills. They charge $0.25 per refill. If you want ranch for your rings, like I do, that's $0.59 extra. Add tax to the bill and my total came out to nearly $12. The cheese for my Chili dog was cheese sauce, like you have with your nacho's, or I could have American cheese. I would have opted for grated cheddar, but a fine establishment like Ted's doesn't  offer it. For the price, I could have gone to Twin Peaks, Portillo's or darn near anywhere else and been served a far better meal. The onion rings were tasty and Diet Dr. Pepper is always a plus. Altogether, I'm not thrilled with my experience, however, I'll give them one more try in the future. Perhaps not so close to closing time.",

You see a menu on the wall with your ordering options, but before you are anywhere near someone that could take your order, you're yelled at.  \"Hey! What do you want?\"  Don't be afraid, but don't be surprised either. Keep your cool and order your dogs. Immediately start thinking about if you want fries or rings (onion rings) and be prepared for when you're called upon again. Then watch as your hot dog is mutilated in front of your eyes and what appears on your tray is what looks like a hot mess of decapitated food.  Never fear though... because it is amazing. Well worth the wait and one of the best dogs you'll ever have. My favorites here are the white hot and the bratwurst. Whenever I know I'm going, I end up salivating like Pavlov's dog for hours.  The booths are classic hot dog stand style and the pennants lined up along the top of the walls are fantastic to look at.

Got two \"regulars\" with ketchup and a side of fries with chili and cheese. Not sure if it's because I ordered them to go or not, but the chili and cheese both came in to-go cups (with the chili being hot enough to almost completely melt the cup and lid) rather than on top of the fries. The two hot dogs were perfectly grilled and it comes on Aunt Hattie's brand buns - my favourite. I ordered the buns grilled too but because my order was taken by about three different people, that didn't happen. The chili seemed like Hormel brand without beans, but it was great. The side that came with my \"chili cheese fries\" was more than enough to also pour over my hot dogs. If you're getting dogs and fries, just order one side of each and it'll be plenty. The fries were thin sliced but really good  - perfectly crispy and fresh.  Two dogs, a regular fry, a side each of chili and cheese, and a large soda came to just over $10.  If you're craving for some classic American food, this is definitely the place to go.",

The service is fast and friendly, and I like seeing the same manager and cooks on the line; no matter who it is though, they cook my bratwurst and fries perfectly.  The charbroil taste of all the meats and old-fashioned atmosphere is so American, you want to go into Ted's wrapped in an American Flag. The ambiance is bright and cheery, but very 70s, and very inviting when you're in the mood for good, old fashioned BBQ (as in the grill, not the sauce!) taste.  The authentic charbroil cooking will always outdo any fast food in Arizona. Best of all, Ted's is probably the cheapest place one can get a hamburger/hot dog/other meat + fries + coke meal. Their cheese sauce does wonders to their fries, and I still have not figured out how they have perfected their french fries. I really can't complain about Ted's!  I might have given them 4 stars before they had a cash only rule, but now they accept credit cards, so 5 stars it is!  Overall: perfect for an American fast food lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "I've been going to Ted's Hot Dogs my entire life, so my opinion may be a little biased. Nobody around has hot dogs as good as these guys. Lucky thing about Ted's is that they have 7 locations in and around Buffalo, New York and ONE in Arizona.   What makes them great are the dogs, obviously. They still have the natural skin casings, so when they're cooked over the large charcoal grill the outsides get nice and chard 'n crispy. When you bite into one of these you get a nice satisfying POP. The toppings you can get are pretty standard but also very fresh, and the chili is very meaty and goes on perfect with a little bit of cheese. The other menu items are just as good. From Foot-longs, White Hots, and Bratwurst to Hamburgers, Corn dogs, and Chicken. It all gets thrown on the grill and cooked to perfection.  Like I've said before my opinion is a little biased, Ted's being a childhood favorite of mine. But nobody stays open for more than 25 years, and still has a guaranteed line out the door during lunch time that isn't worth checking out.",

I don't mind the line because I know my food is being made fresh in front of me, and besides, the employees know how to keep the line moving quickly and efficiently. Don't forget to get a side of liquid cheese for your fries! While I'm sure it's not even technically cheese, it's still awesome.   This might be a weird praise, but I also like that I've never seen a dirty table here. I hate when I go into a fast food place (chain or independent) and can't find a table to sit at because the slobs before me couldn't be bothered to clean up after themselves. I don't know if Ted's customers are super clean, or if employees are sneaking around cleaning tables off when I'm not looking, but I can always find a place to sit here!",

In high school, I discovered that Ted's had a location in Tempe, only a bit away from my parent's house in Mesa.  The yumminess of the food definitely translated west of the Mississippi.  Everything is so good and has that awesome taste of being grilled and perhaps fried (like the fries and onion rings)  without being too heavy.  I love standing in line, calling out my order when asked, buying Weber's mustard (I haven't found it sold anywhere else in Arizona), drinking fountain rootbeer that has a kick, looking at the Buffalo, NY paraphenalia that decorates the walls.   On the trays, there is a paper with a quiz that I pretty much have memorized.  I know, from the quiz, that Ted's uses 7 million pickle spears per year.  I also always laugh with my friends over the easiest question on the quiz: \"True or False; there is a Ted's Hotdogs location in Tempe, AZ\" (the quiz was clearly written for my Ted's friends to the east).  It gets pretty crowded at lunchtime and stays that way through the afternoon.  I would suggest going slightly before noon or after 2:30pm.",

The kitchen is well-maintained and the self-service is efficient, even with a line 20 deep.  The grill uses charcoal.  Although I didn't order any fries or onion rings, they looked good and Ted's also touts real ice cream milkshakes. The only minor downgrade I have is that the location is in a strip mall and it just lacks a traditional hot dog stand feel to it.  It's clean, but maybe just a little too clean.  Otherwise, very good...",

There are other variations in the Valley that are also very good but Ted's has its own unique flavor and texture. Prices are fair and the ambiance is \"old school.\" Don't expect to be waited on but the staff is always courteous. I like the all beef with mustard, onion and pickle. How much more \"all American hot dog\" can you get? Some places use gimmicks and bizarre hot dog creations to attract. You won't find those at Ted's. We enjoyed Ted's again this week and the reason I am not giving 5 stars is their onion rings seem to have become a bag full of little crunchy things lately. Years ago they were large, juicy rings with a tasty batter. Our recent experiences with them have been a little disappointing... too many little crunchies. We will continue to patronize when in the mood.",

You order and then stand around as the dog cooks, waiting until it's done to give your condiment order.  I could go without that part because people are just piled up and it makes it go a lot slower since you can't put an order in because 10 people in front of you are just standing waiting for their dogs to cook.  I think they should take the order, cash out, and then get the food cooked and delivered.  That is the only reason I removed a star.    However, I'll stand around for a hot dog that good.  Sometimes they are too busy for me to wait around so I will do a drive-by but I usually stick to their less busy hours.    The one other thing that has always irked me was how badly they assault that poor defenseless dog.  They cut that thing, and slice it as if it just insulted their mother.  Apparently it helps because it is delicious.  I just wish it didn't have to take such abuse prior to arriving in my mouth.  I am a big proponent of humane treatment, even after it has taken its form as food.",

    "text": "A friend and I went to Teds Hot Dogs on a Friday evening, it was both of ours 1st time there and we were not disappointed. We too have to say Ted's Hot Dogs are among the best in the valley and how lucky are we to have Ted's out of his 7 locations, mostly being in the New York area, we have one in Tempe AZ!  Once you walk in you see where the line is forming, don't be alarmed, it's really not a slow moving line, once in line you place your order you can c watch your dog (or burger, but really who goes to a HOT DOG joint to order a burger?) cooking on a grill, getting plump and nice grill marks on them! Then once it is cooked, you will be asked what you want on it, now the chili cheese dog did look great but I went for an all-beef hot dog with mayo (that's how I like it) sliced pickles, grilled onions & peppers! BOY O BOY was it good!!  My friend ordered the foot long dog with chili. We also got some french fries & their freshly handmade onion rings, which were very good. They have other types of dogs on the overhead menu, brats, polish, white?, and reg dogs and the foot long & all beef.  Next time I will try the polish dog!",

Only complaint: Store bought hot dog   buns - they don't try to hide it or anything, but seeing the bag of Rainbow, or Aunt Haddys, or whatever it was, just kills it a little bit.   Homemade buns  would be cool, but this place is pretty great. I like the  dining area as well. Just simple, bright, and clean.",

The line was pretty long each time, but for good reason...great food. REALLY like the charbroil aspect; I had a hot dog the first visit and a brat the second - both were worth writing home about. I remember the fries being pretty standard - not bad but nothing overly exciting. The staff were upbeat both times and I'm looking forward to my next visit. Excited to see they take debit/credit now!",

I would have given Ted's 5 Stars but their bathroom is too small for all of the crowds they get here. Hard to get a seat here if you know what I mean.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed!

If you like your food with more of modern twist this place isn't 'for you. I ate here today just after the big lunch rush and was underwhelmed. This was like my third visit and it seem like each time is less enjoyable.  This time I had the foot long chill cheese dog with peppers and a medium Logan Berry drink for $7.31. Granted I do like how the hot dogs are char grilled but I don't think that's enough to keep me coming here on a regular. I will say the brats are really good and one of kind, I like those and I'll stick to that when I come here.  Don't worry about good customer service either because the lady yelling at you \"what do you want?\" while you're in line will make you feel warm and fuzzy (I kid, but really that's the ordering process).",

If you go to Ted's for a burger, you will be disappointed. They are not a burger joint. If you go to Ted's for atmosphere... There's no hope for you. It's a hot dog joint.  If you go for meat wrapped in some form of tubing, you should not leave disappointed. Especially if you order the almighty loganberry shake.  Fries. Tube meat. Shake/soda.

The Venue: Small, somewhat old place in the same complex as SakeBomber. Plenty of parking. With indoor and outdoor seating. Clean and well maintained.  The Chow: Burgers, hotdogs, Polish, Brats, White Hots. Toppings the usual plus cheese, chili, grilled veg and sauerkraut for an additional fee. Fries and Onion Rings. Old school Milk Shakes.  REVIEW: Love the grilled offerings of Polish and White Hots. So delicious! The onion rings are awesome and the fries good. Heard the burgers are delicious too, bigger and of course cost a bit more than your fast food chain burger.  TIP: If you plan a trip, go early. Lines, no matter what day can get really long.  But if you do get there during peak, I can tell you it is worth the wait.",

The fries are good and onion rings are on my bucket list the next time I am there with a friend to share the big order with.   Deducting one star for the service. Sad to say but the girl who dressed my dog was obviously angry that she had to take over someone else's position on the line and she made no attempt to hide it. She gave the other worker a really nasty look and rolled her eyes at another employee. She slammed the buns down on the counter and was downright short tempered with all the customers. It was very unprofessional. She needs to learn to curb her emotions when serving the public.  UPDATE: Tried the onion rings today - they are great except for one thing - they should be sliced thicker. They are battered, not breaded, the way rings should be. Huge order.",

If you've ever been there you know there's probably going to be a long line when you arrive.. but you wait anyway because it's Ted's Hot Dogs and it's delicious! The line goes fast, and before you know you it you are up there placing your own order.  The menu is pretty simple: Hot dogs  But there's a variety of different kinds, ranging from your basic doggy, to delicious savory bratwurst, and various delicious sausage treats in between. They cook it right in front of you, as you direct the condiment distribution... my mouth is usually watering throughout this entire process.  I have never had a bad experience with Ted's, and although some people complain about the line I have never had it take more than 5-10 minutes to get through... and it's well worth it!",

    "text": "I love reading about my yelp friends' vacation finds.  I always bookmark them because although I never know when I'll be in that part of the country, I do know those bookmarks will eventually become tourist destinations for me.  My yelp bud Tim S. knows his comfort foods.  When he raves about a pizza in New York, a cheesesteak in Philly, or a hot dog in Phoenix, I'm so there.  Wait a Hot Dog in Phoenix?  That can't be right.  This ain't Chicago or New York.  Or is it?  Ted's is a Buffalo, NY Hot Dog blooming right here in the middle of the desert, transplanted in 1983 from it's 1927 original wintery environment.    Sometimes when you are a food tourist, it's ok to over order and try a few different things.  It's not ok for your waistline, but \"Hey you're on vacation!\"  At least that's what I tell myself.  And I got absolutely no judgement from Ted's when I ordered a Regular Hot Dog, a Jumbo All Beef dog, an Italian Sausage, and a Bratwurst.  Chased down with some Onion Rings and a Loganberry Milkshake.  So what makes Ted's so good, is the charcoal.  As I came in, they were adding a bunch of new charcoal to the grill.  It gives the dog a nice smokey flavor and a good snap.  Each of my 4 dogs/ sausages were excellent and it's tough to choose which one was best.  I actually think I preferred the basic hot dog, because of the soft grind of the wiener offset with the crunchy slightly charred casing.  It was texture heaven for sure, and I got this one dressed in classic Chicago style - chopped onions, relish, tomato, pickle, and yellow mustard.  I dressed the all beef with kraut and chopped onions - excellent dog although a little firmer in texture, as most beef dogs are.    They have polish, bratwurst, italian, and a white hot under their sausage menu.  I read a couple of slightly negative reviews on the white hot, so while it sounded very interesting, I had no room to put one down on this visit.  Italian and Bratwurst it was for me and I got them dressed the same way with grilled onions and peppers.  I opted for the hot sauce on the side.  The hot sauce pairs perfectly with the Italian Sausage.  This is a nice and spicy Italian.  Adding the hot sauce seemed to just reinforce that same flavor, rather than cover it up.  Ted's has an interesting home made hot sauce.  If you made a salsa out of hot dog condiments, this is what you would get - relish, onions, in a ketchup vinegar base.  For the bratwurst I went straight up with some brown deli mustard.  Awesome!   Next visit, I'm trying a chili cheese dog for sure.  The onion rings taste like an onion loaf, but not super peppery.  They have a great batter here, but I like that you can still taste the onion and there isn't too much batter.  The Loganberry shake is a must order.  The perfect sweet creamy drink to offset the spicy Italian Sausage.  From what I understand loganberry is a Western NY flavor, because you don't see it around these here parts too much.  It's like a red blackberry.  I have no idea if it was loganberry flavored ice cream or vanilla ice cream with loganberry syrup.  Whatever it is, order it and you will be happy.  I can't wait until the next time I'm in Phoenix (or Buffalo) to get me a charcoal grilled dog at Ted's. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teds-hot-dogs-tempe?select=HYh6Dv4htWxebTjRMwgh6g#OCLoB-p-pzUUNcCib8xK-Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/teds...</a>",

They acted as if they had never heard of it before, and made it to their order not mine.  Crew so big of hurry they did not put bacon or onion ring on burger. Lettuce was pulled soaking wet from bin and put on burger making bun a soaking wet mess. Burger came up before the people ahead of me. It sat there incomplete and soaking wet. Then they forgot the regular hot dog. Charged me for everything including onion rings i didn't order. Hot dog bun was ICE cold. Burger bun a wet mess and w/o bacon. I got refund for onion rings i did not order and they put a cold onion ring on my slop burger. Ordered and paid for but did not get what i ordered. Strange they had plenty of time to bullshit with ASU sports idiots. But not enough time to get customers order right. I drove 56 miles round trip and got screwed out of money and a decent hot meal.",

    "text": "A hot dog, is a hot dog. Unless it's Ted's.   Seriously there is black magic going on here. Apparently they start by getting a super high quality dog made for them back in Buffalo, then they beat the heck out of it above open flame! Seriously they poke and slice the dog up while it's being grilled over white oak charcoal and it picks up all that smokey goodness while cooking.   There are two other shining stars at Teds. Their house hot sauce and the Loganberry drink. The loganberry is basically glorified koolaid, but man is it good. The hot sauce is more of a relish and is unlike any other I have had. I'm not really sure what's going on in it, but it's just a little spicy, sweet and awesome.  Their cheese is straight up east coast style cheese sauce. Basically cheese wiz. If you like that sort of thing go for it. The chili is that midwest no beans kind. Not my thing, but that's fine. I always get the jumbo all beef topped with mustard, relish, onions and the hot sauce.   Everything not fried is cooked over that same white oak charcoal, so it all picks up that goodness. That means if you're not feeling a hotdog, everything else is going to be sold, but keep in mind \"Hot Dog\" is in the name of the place. Don't expect for their burger to change your world.  Last time I checked their were 8 locations. 7 in Buffalo, NY and this one.",

    "text": "Went there on a Sunday 3 weeks ago to get hot dogs . I have come to expect a long slow line to order my food, usually 10 to 15 minutes, it irritates me , but I tolerate it.  On this day I waited  at least 35 minutes to order a couple hot dogs, that's not just poor service, that's complete total Disrespect by management toward their customers. As I got near front of line, I did see the manager poke his head out from the back of the restaurant , so I know the manager working that day. He didn't seem to concerned about the wait time, no sense of urgency. By the time  I got to the front of line I forgot to order the soda my wife wanted, because I was so completely pissed off about standing in line so long. I ordered a White Hot as usual, wife got a regular hot dog, the food was fine.  I understand they remodeled this place a couple years ago, what a wasted opportunity to re-design the ordering process. You know I can go to the Dutch Brothers over on Mill & Southern and they almost always has a line that snakes thru the parking lot.  Yet it only takes few minutes to get thru the line at Dutch bros because there is someone walking car to car taking orders with a smart phone device. You know Ted's, it wouldn't be that difficult have an employee with an I-pad  taking orders in line, and maybe add a second toppings station, and another register to facilitate the ordering  process . A 35 - 40  minute wait, or even 10-15 minute wait, is too long of a wait to order a Hot dog, it speaks volumes about how little you care about your customers.",

When I want meat, I don't look for a steak--I want burgers and dogs, and Ted's did not disappoint.  With many dogs, the primary taste is from whatever condiments you put on the wiener.  With Ted's dogs, you get a smoky, slightly burnt taste of a REAL charcoal grilled frank that is enhanced by your custom toppings.  My tastes are simple and easy to please.  I like a foot long with just extra deli mustard--don't need more than that.  My wife likes more--mustard, ketchup, a little relish, and pickles.  Doesn't matter how you want it--Ted's will serve it up awesome.  Add fries and you've got a full meal for cheap.  Forget Circle K, and Wienerschnitzel can bite me.

If the line is long (so, closer to the main door), the wait can be about 15-20 minutes, and plenty of time to change your mind from wanting a Brat, or maybe an Italian sounds better, or maybe the White Hot, nah I think I'll try a Sea Dog, or Polish?  No, Italian, yes, an Italian with fries and onion rings?  Just onion rings.  I'm indecisive, if you couldn't tell.  Their most recent addition has been to add mac and cheese on your freshly grilled, and perfectly burnt (in a good way!) hot dog, for an extra 75 cents.  This and chilli, is the most amazing thing ever.  And don't forget to get some cheese on the side!  I might have to start attending cheese-aholic meetings, for the sake of my cholesterol (no, I refuse to see exercise as an option here).  Cut to the chase:  My favorite things about this place, the perfectly grilled hot dogs, great choice of toppings (only the cheese, mac and cheese, and chilli are an extra charge), and those Teddy Bars look so good!  Though I've yet to try one.  My only complaint is the wait, but I've noticed that Ted's isn't so busy at dinner.  I hope I didn't just jinx that",

I prefer the all beef hot dogs and usually order one and pair it with another style (braut, polish, or red hot).  Their burgers are delicious and the perfect size.  Onion rings are homemade and made to orders.  Pro tip: Although I am a purest and don't usually enjoy ketchup on my hot dogs, order the Ted's red hot sauce.  It is ketchup based yet extremely tasty. Also, the grilled onions and peppers are a side condiment option that most people miss.",

Even when I walked in nothing rang a bell. Anyway...  I was in the area and randomly stopped in with my mom and sister. I'm not a big hot dog eater and was planning on getting something else when I walked in, but 1) I had a big lunch earlier and wasn't really starving so just a regular hot dog sounded like it would hit the spot and 2) the dogs are grilled right in front of you to order. I'll eat them, but I'm not a big fan of boiled hot dogs, so when I saw the grill it sounded more appealing.   Like I said I got a regular hot dog w/mustard, BBQ sauce and jalapenos. I like the topping bar and the many different things you can choose. Honestly, you can put anything you want on them. There's a list of toppings on the menu, but if there's something else you want and they have it, they'll throw it on your hot dog. A woman in front of me wanted red onion on hers (I'm guessing they have them for burgers) so they got them out and added it to hers.   Also got cheese fries. The cheese was yummy! My mom got potato salad with her hot dog. I tried it and it was fine, but nothing special.   I also had a vanilla malt that was delicious. I LOVE it when places do malts and not just milkshakes.  When we came in we were lucky. There was only a few people in front of us so the wait wasn't that bad (remember, everything is made to order). However, when we sat down a line started to form and I can imagine the wait can get backed up.",

The hot dogs were cooked just right and the fries were thin and crispy. My son enjoyed his mac n cheese and of course, ate the applesauce first. He loved playing with the hat he was given with his meal too.   The restaurant was well maintained and very clean, as well as the restroom.

There is also a bar type seating at the window which would have worked had the customer order line of people not been blocking it. Then there was the cost.

    "text": "Took the short 15 minute drive out to Broadway and McClintock today and ordered up an all-beef hot dog with chili, cheese and onions, and an Italian Sausage dog with mustard, ketchup and a pickle. Both dogs were near perfect.  Some nice char on both dogs providing a good crunch. The only suggestion would be to amp up their chili a little bit.  It's pretty bland, but is otherwise fine.  I meant to get a side of hot sauce, but forgot.  I think that might have improved the chili cheese dog a bit.  The Italian sausage was mildly spicy with very good flavor. I also had the onion rings.  I thought they were very good.  Nice strong onion taste and fresh and hot.    I was there on a Saturday morning just after 11, and there at least 15 people in line ahead of me.  That being said, the line moves fairly quickly.  They are efficient at what they do - don't wait until the last second to make your decisions.  They griller will yell out well ahead in line asking what you want.  Be prepared to yell your order out to him as he'll need to be able to hear your from a little bit of a distance.  They need to do this to get the dogs on the grill for you so that by the time you get to the condiment man, your dogs will be ready.  You'll just need to repeat your order to the condiment person so he knows which ones to grab, then you tell him what you want on each one.  Then he hands your completed order off to the cashier - and your done.  By the time I left, there were at least 30 people in line.  It's a pretty popular place - with good reason.  All the staff I interacted with were very friendly.  It's a good thing for my general well-being and overall health that this place isn't closer to me.  I would eat there a lot.  As it is, it's just far enough away that I'll go maybe once every 2-3 months.",

If you like this sort of thing, you'll love these. I'd tried Ted's once before and again, even in my inebriated state, I was thrown off a bit by it. Being from Chicago, Lobby's wins for me on the dog front. For fries, though, I'd give it to Ted's. Get them with the cheese and die happy.   I also agree with others here that there is a certain charm about the place and having staff take your order through long distance shouting as you wait in line and aren't quite certain whose turn it is.   If I was looking for a meal of cheese fries I'd come here in a heart beat. For hot dogs though I'll probably be waiting till the next beer fest.",

I ate at Ted's for lunch on Sunday with my wife.  We both got the Jumbo All Beef dog with all the toppings (Catsup, Mustard, Onions, Relish, and a Pickle)... The problem was, while in line for only 5 minutes the staff managed to screw up 3 different orders.  That was like 40% screw up!  They were not apologetic, and the customers were getting irate!  This isn't the atmosphere I look for when eating lunch.  Irate customers and hasty cooks are not a good combo.  The onion rings were just a knot of messy fried mystery.  Don't get me wrong, I ate them!  Unfortunately, I can't give this place more than 3 stars.  And with this review I will be buying a handgun for protection.",

My cohorts at work turned me onto Ted's and I kept it secret from my wife.  Yes, I'm that cruel.  Then one Sunday morning we were watching one of those Top 10 Hot Dog shows on the Food Network or Travel Channel.  She said to me, \"I wish we could have a great hot dog today.\"  I broke down and wept, confessing my multiple sins of all the times I tip toed to Ted's to enjoy a chili footlong dog and an all beef dog with the works. She, loving me, immediately hit me a couple of times about the head, and said \"Get dressed bitch - lunch is on you.\"  Now, if you ever meet Marie, you'll come to know that she is sweet and understanding, but on that day, I found one of her few limits.  Needless to say, we had a great experience at Ted's that Sunday.  REMEMBER:  They only take cash.  No debit cards, no credit cards, no bartering.",

Several people said Ted's had great onion rings......so off I went!    I expected a smaller place but I was pleasantly suprised when I pulled up to a medium sized store.  I was greated with a smile and asked what I would like.  It was a Sunday afternoon so they were not very busy.  I liked the fact that you tell them what you want and they toss it on the grill right in front of you.  Everything is freshly cooked.  They did the same with the onion rings and french fries too.  Everything was fresh and hot.  My daughter had her favorite....a hot dog, which she loved, and fries which were fresh and crisp.  I had a burger and onion rings.  Yes, the onion rings were delicious!  The batter was great and the onions were a little on the sweet side.  My burger was cooked to perfection.    This is another great little place we will go back to.  It's also sort of near my work so maybe I'll get out one day and go here for lunch.  Thanks Ted's and Yelpers!",

Weber's is a small factory in Western NY that still does everything by hand.  It's a horseradish mustard and the best! Their onion rings are dunked and fried right in front of your eyes.  Not too much batter, and you can actually taste the onion. Expect a line.  Anytime, day or night, it's packed!  THAT is how good this place is! I love going, just to read the walls while waiting in line.   It takes me back home to Buffalo.  A place I will never in my life go visit again, but at least I can eat the food I grew up with!",

    "text": "When I'm craving a hot dog, Ted's Hot Dogs is the place to go in Tempe. Now that sentence does contain pretty many qualifiers; I do, of course, have to be craving hot dogs; and I wouldn't drive any great distance to feed that craving.   Nonetheless, Ted's is decent for many reasons. All hot dogs and hamburgers are charcoal grilled, the sides are served in large portions, and they have many different toppings.   Now there is another very similar charcoal grill restaurant in Tempe that offers hot dogs and hamburgers -ach*chuckbox*oo- but their fare is more hamburger friendly. Ted's offers regular, foot long, and all beef franks, as well as Italian, Polish, and White Hot Sausages. Anything char-grilled is  good in my book, but the Italian sausage with peppers and onions is great. They also have the traditional toppings like ketchup, mustard, pickle, onion, tomato, etc.   The sides are dropped right when you order them, served in a basket wrapped in paper to hold it all together.  Both the fries and onion rings are good, but I prefer the fries because of the batter on the rings. While only having two side items is limited, they are a decent price.  There is one thing that I don't recommend ordering here, which is why I give them three stars instead of four. Coming from Cincinnati, one of the most important preparations of a hot dog is the chili cheese coney. I went here tonight in search of a coney similar to that of Skyline in Cincinnati: a fried dog served on a steamed bun with bean-less, finely ground chili and heaps of shredded cheese. No charcoal grilled hot dog should be covered in chili, the chili itself is pretty thick, the cheese was nacho cheese, and the hot sauce was more like salsa. I definitely will never order a chili cheese dog here again.   That being said I would point anybody in need of a grilled hot dog or sausage to Ted's.",

You start by ordering your food at the grill, but the menu is over by the register (at the end of the line). Next, you pick your toppings, but you have to specify what meat you got (which causes a mess when the cook is trying to give the worker one thing for someone else somewhere else in the line). While this is happening, you have other people asking if you want anything to drink. Then you get to the register and have to repeat your order, while having to be sure to add sides of fries or onion rings if no one in the beginning of the line happened to ask you. Not only does this take forever but it feels like you are constantly repeating the same order to every person down the line.  Because of the constant delays in this process, the fries get double fried, the milkshakes come out runny, and you end up spending 30 minutes in line behind 3 people.  You can get food on par with this from any other burger place. I would recommend skipping the hassle and just going there.",

The difference is that Ted's was $3.00!!! Really disappointing. The split (1/2 fries 1/2 rings) were ok but the fries were not crisp. Stick with the dogs or sausages you can find a much better burger in a lot of places. Bummer.",

I honestly forgot about it for a bit, but then I saw the original Ted's featured on one of the food shows.  There was a short line to begin with but didn't take long for them to get through the line.  I placed my order (with the grill master) for a Jumbo Chili Cheese Dog, onion rings, and a med drink, which he called out.  It appeared they had a system down; unfortunately, I was wrong.  They forgot to put down my order of onion rings, or it went to someone else (don't know what happened there) and then they mixed up my drink cup size, with no drink cup...needless to say I had to wait another few minutes for them to cook an order of onion rings.  Not a real big deal, other than my chili cheese dog was getting cold.  Once the order was ready though, I took it and my tray of food to a table.  The onion rings really didn't taste like they were fully cooked based on the batter consistency and it was all \"clumped\" together, which was a disappointment.  I was really looking forward to them, they were the shoe string type of onion rings.  The chili cheese dog was ok, I do like char-grilled hot dogs, but nothing that really stood out to me to say wow.  But the buns they use are quality ones (I believe they are the potato buns).  I wouldn't mind though going back, when I'm in the area and trying a regular jumbo dog with my choice of traditional fixings...and will go with the French fries next time.",

    "text": "I live super close to Ted's, and have been wanting to try it since forever because of the high ratings from Yelp and people I know. Unfortunately, it did not even come close to my high expectations.   Maybe it's because I'm not a fan of having my hot dog burnt, which I guess is what char-grilled means. Which I was unaware of how they usually cooked their hot dogs. My mistake.  The dude behind the counter grillin it up was really nice, which is why I gave it two stars. However, the wait was excruciating long for the food to taste as bad as it did. I ordered a Mac and cheese dog to go with a side of fries. I almost forgot I ordered fries because they really lacked uniqueness to me. And the dog just took over my thoughts anyway.   So it was burnt. Like I said. I had to peel off the black skin around the dog for it to be edible. Then, since I got my dog to go, by the time I got home (literally 2 minutes later) my bun was all soggy from the Mac and cheese. As a suggestion, if they order it to go maybe just put it on the side and let them put it on.   The Mac and cheese was also disappointing. I'm thinking I'm getting some actual cooked pasta, when really it tasted like easy mac. I'm a Mac and cheese lover and that was just so sad to me.   I'm really sorry that I had to write this review because I just heard amazing things about this place. Maybe it was just my experience but yeah, I won't be going there ever again.",

I was sold.  I had the White Hot [veal and pork], a Regular with chili cheese, and a vanilla maltshake.  It was the best meal I had that long stressful year as a Digital Art major.

    "text": "Ted's Hot Dogs is one of those places that just emits an aura of times long gone. When walking into this establishment I immediately heard music from the 1950s and 60s. I could smell the meat cooking on the grill and I felt like I was in another world. I looked over Ted's menu and some of the signage and became aware that this place is tied to and related to a chain of \"Ted's Hot Dogs\" found in Buffalo New York.   The line was fairly considerable on my initial visit and after perusing the menu I settled on an all beef hot dog, onion rings and a soft drink. With the hot dog I decided to make it as close to a Chicago style hot dog as possible. So I asked for mustard, relish,, onions, tomato, and a pickle slice.  I took the dog to an open table and dug in. The taste of the sausage here is definitely different than the steamed Chicago style dogs I'm used to. One primary reason is that everything (well all the meats) at Ted's is char grilled. This gives a nice grilled flavor to it, the actual hot dog used had an unusual filler taste with a somewhat sweet flavor rather than spicy. All things considered it was a strange mix.  The onion rings weren't so great, these were very thin onion peels deep fried. While they were plentiful there was very little onion and just lots of batter. I'd say I was a bit disappointed with them.  Since I've been in Arizona for quite a few days I did decide to return to Ted's and try things just a little differently. I went for a footlong dog which was only a little more expensive on my second visit. And rather than go for the toppings mentioned above I opted for Chili. The footlong dog was a great value and while the chilli was an extra 60 or so cents, I felt this was a much better dog than the one I ordered the first time and a lot of food for the money.  I ALSO got a regular cheeseburger, this was fairly standard and tasted like most burgers that come off of a backyard grill. Not bad, but nothing worth writing home about.  My overall opinion of Ted's is that I love the ambiance and atmosphere, the food is pretty good and it's a good value if you go for the giant footlong hot dog. I am going to give Ted's Hot Dogs four stars and a recommendation if you happen to be in Tempe Arizona.",

There was a long line but the really fast all the dogs and burgers are char grill over an open flame. The grill master cool take your order on how many dogs next person will ask it what you want on it, you're hot dogs are made until you order it so you can watch the whole process, I ordered mustard chili and onions absolutely delicious my has been ordered mustard pickles and onions will ordered french fries, they have many different sauces for your fries we have the mall vinegar. Logan berry shake was perfect very thick, It just a good old-fashioned shake. Since the owners are from Buffalo New York,you'll see a lot of Western New York memorabilia. My husbands from Buffalo so having these hotdogs was very nostalgic for him. Great place to take the family.",

Here is the low-down:  Good: -Charcoal grilled everything (they also have burgers and chicken) - Aunt Hattie's buns for the dogs (is a personal pref) - several types of homemade dipping sauces you won't find anywhere else to dip the fries in...some also go good on your dog - Lots of fresh toppings to choose from (lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, relish, etc.) - Large dining area which was well kept - The bathrooms were clean and smelled good - Love how well preserved the building and signage are well kept (60's-70's era)  Bad: - While the meats are cooked to order and come out hot and fresh, my fries tastes like they had been under a heat lamp for a while and they were flimsy and cool.  Ugly: - None  Just discovered this place after living in the East Valley for almost 10 years and has instantly become one of my favorite restaurants in the whole state. Will definitely be back...and soon!",

Great selection of toppings, but I must (IMO) deduct one star for the chili. Just a taste thing for me, overly 'tomatoey' (like that's a word) and I like more of a spicy traditional chili.

The dining area is spacious & there's also outdoor seating for when the weather is (wait, this isn't Buffalo - it's always warm), the restaurant is clean, & the line moved quickly, so staff clearly has their act together.  You go in, you place your order & it's grilled as you go - they'll throw your burger or chicken or hot dog or whatever on the grill & by the time you've told them you want fries with that, it'll be ready for you to select your toppings.  I went with a grilled chicken sandwich, fries & of course some loganberry, in both soda & shake form.  Yes, anxious travelers from WNY, they have loganberry.  And it is good!

My boyfriend got the regular dog and the bratwurst dog, and I got two regular dogs and a small french fry (and a side of ranch). This did seem a little pricey to us (the total came out to be ~$18.50).   While the hotdog meat didn't blow us away (it was almost like buying regular old hotdogs at Walmart), again, the charcoaling of it was what made the meal good.   What I loved most about the meal was definitely the french fries. Something about them was just right! I wish I could have tried the onion rings, as they looked pretty good.  Being our first times there, the ordering process was kind of confusing to us. After we paid, we weren't told what we were supposed to do (ex. Wait there, go sit down and they'll bring the food over, etc.) So we elected to go grab a bench and wait. Turns out we were supposed to wait up there to then tell them what toppings we wanted on the hotdog!  Overall, this place was okay, a little expensive in my opinion for, well, a hotdog, but nevertheless, I would probably come back once or twice more if I were REALLY craving a hotdog and fries.",

They grill the hot dogs and burgers right in front of you and then have the selection of toppings. The staff was nice as well when placing our order.   My husband got the jumbo hot dog with melted cheese and bacon. It was delicious and he loved the 2 full strips of bacon on top. Great portion and glad they don't skimp on the bacon. I got the the regular hot dog with melted cheese and bacon. It was alright but the all beef jumbo dog was way better, I will get that next time. We shared an order of fries which were delicious. Fresh and crispy. Large side of ranch for 75cents extra to dip fries in.   Looking forward to coming back to try more things. Thanks!",

    "text": "I can well imagine myself having been a regular here back in my college days had I been a Sun Devil.  Alas, I was a Lumberjack (and no I don't regret it for a second).  Ted's is the type of cheap comfort fare that unites poor hungry college kids and the general public at large.  Hot dogs, burgers, chicken sandwiches, sausages, shakes, you get the idea.  For Tempe locals and ASU alums, Ted's is an institution.  So on a Saturday at lunchtime it was time to pay homage to this local staple with a long history.  Ted's Tempe location can be found on the southwest corner of McClintock and Broadway.  I note that this is the Tempe location because Ted's is actually a chain of hot dog stands based in Buffalo, New York.  Currently 9 Buffalo area locations as of me writing this in fact.  The only non-Buffalo area location?  Right here in Tempe.  Opened almost a century ago by founder Ted Liaros, the chain is still family owned and operated to this day.  You can see that pride just walking in the door of their Tempe operation.  The place is immaculately clean and well kept.  I grabbed a spot in line as a steady stream of lunch goers walked in throughout.  The menu here is very customizable as you start your trek at the grill and tell them what kind of meat you want grilled up.  I decided to go with a suggestion listed on the \"Hall of Flame\" end of the menu.  A footlong hot dog coated in chili and cheese.  The dog is grilled, coated in melted cheddar cheese and topped with their housemade chili (you can opt for a bunch of other toppings as well, but I kept mine as is).  To wash down this meaty dog, I opted for a shake.  Specifically, a Loganberry (basically a hybrid of raspberry and blackberry for those not up on their plant kingdom).  Total cost for everything including tax came to about $11.  The food and beverage came out to my table in about 2 minutes.  First, the shake.  A very pleasant, creamy, slightly tart concoction.  The raspberry notes are a little more pronounced, but honestly you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who wouldn't find this a tasty treat.  Now for the footlong.  As you might imagine there's no getting around the fact that this is a messy meal.  I'm sure regulars (especially in Buffalo) would mock my usage of a knife and fork for this, but I could think of no better options.  I really liked the chili on this.  Not watered down or overdone with beans.  Just a good balance of meat, beans and sauce.  The cheese sauce and the dog itself were good, though nothing particularly special about those in my book.  Simon's in Scottsdale has been my favorite dog in town and that remains the case.  That said, for $11, I got a pretty good value.  Service was excellent, restaurant was in excellent condition as I mentioned earlier, and the shake and chili were spot on.  I'll probably try one of their burgers next time I'm here.  Or just customize my own meal, which they pretty much encourage you to do anyway.  I may not have been an ASU student, but I'm quite certain Ted's has served tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of Sun Devils over the years.  As long as they stick to their formula, they'll be around long enough to see many more generations of maroon and gold walk through their doors.",

They recently remodeled this location and really provided a fresh, clean and modern feel to the dining room and menu boards. Modern decor, seating and fixtures to new digital menu boards have really freshened the place up.   As for their food, it is legit. There are not many places where you can find authentic Sahlen's Hot Dogs straight from NY, other than Ted's that is. And this isn't flame grilled over propane folks. This is grilled over smoldering coals, low and slow. Their grill masters cut the skin and roll the dogs back forth to perfectly crisp that outer casing for an amazing hot dog every time.   We had a foot long dog with chili and cheese, regular dog with cheese, kids dog w/ ketchup, a burger with American, and some french fries. The dogs were all amazing and cooked perfectly. The burger was pretty good but I definitely had some regret only getting the regular and not getting the larger patty. Need more charcoal grilled beef!!  Ted's is just like a good old fashioned backyard cookout, without having to wait for the charcoals to warm up!",

Add any toppings to personalize it to your taste. The bacon and cheese dog is decadently delicious and filling (must be all the fat from the bacon and cheese!) My husband loves the white veal dog. It is tasty! I'm partial to the Italian sausage with peppers and onions.  I Savor each bite.  The French fries are crisp, hot and not oily and they give a huge portion.  Originally from Rochester in upstate New York, Ted's has a delicious LOGANBERRY Shake. I would try it at least once. It is good!",

One walks to the back and the other looks at me and says, \"kids\", when the guy looked to be about my age. Still was never greeted and it took probably about 5 minutes for the woman up front to finally ask if I was ready to order. Not a long wait which was nice but she rung me up but couldn't take my money since she was cooking- okay good job there. I get my food and the one guy still has an attitude so I see why they were arguing. They give me my food with almost not realizing I didn't pay! For a bacon hot dog, there definitely was to much bread which also seemed hard and very dry. Also the bacon nor hot dog looked burnt but tasted like it. French fries are also pretty mediocre. I don't think $10 for a foot long hot dog and fries was worth it since it tasted like a BBQ hot dog. Kinda want to come back for the drama though.",

I definitely recommend the cheese fries, they're a fantastic compliment to a hot dog.  With so many great hot dog choices in Tempe (Portillo's/Detroit Coney grill are two other solid options) Ted's definitely has their own niche. Always enjoy coming here.",

Also, seeing as how the food my friends had looked the same (I think I tried some of theirs but can't remember for sure) and they raved about it, I don't write this off as an anomaly and will go ahead and review Ted's.  Like I said, the hot dog was extremely average. Nothing different than you would get off of a typical hot dog vendor.  The burger was below average. The patty was too thin and it just wasn't that good.  The workers were what I like at a place. They took my order, made my food, and nothing more. Good job. The store has a pretty cool feel to it. The line was short when I went, but apparently it can get quite long.  How was the experience overall?

Because no one would believe me that I was waiting in a line like this for HOT DOGS when there was no baseball game in the vicinity.  But then I tasted the dog's and now I understand completely, and I'll be waiting in line again some time soon.  Ted's was founded in 1927 for one purpose only - great hot dogs.  That has now expanded to about 4 different kind of dogs, burgers, fries and shakes.  The burgers and dogs are all cooked over a charcoal grill so it has that home cooked on the BBQ kind of taste.  They also have their own hot sauce that can be used on the burgers and dogs.  I had to try it and it's really yummy.  Just enough spice, but not too much.  Their Onion Rings were amazing, but I'm never getting them again when I'm alone!  They give a huge amount of them too.  They aren't thick cut, but instead cut exceptionally thin and served  squished into this funky origami with a base kind of serving thing.  You'll understand when you go.   I haven't tried their shake yet, but it's made w/ real milk and ice cream, so you know I have to get it one of these days soon!    Last note - their service is amazing.  Talk about a well run machine.  Girl working the grill is yelling out into the line to find out what they want so it can get started before they even approach the counter!  Another guy doing drinks and special orders.  Another girl doing toppings. Another girl manning the fryer.   And one guy ringing it all up.  These people didn't stop moving for a second the whole time I was here.  Really outstanding.  Almost as good as those dogs....",

Yes, its crowded but the line moves; yes, they yell across the room for your order and yes its cooked open fire style. You can throw any number of things on top. I'm still sorry but unless I am sitting at Yankee Stadium with a Nathan's hot dog on a perfect June day - which is all about the experience and the location - its still just a hot dog.   Its fine. Just fine. Its a hot dog. With or without stuff.",

Toppings: Kraut, ketchup, mustard, pickles, relish, onions, chili, melted cheese sauce, italian peppers.   The onion rings were great. Thin and thick, reminds me of Chilis onion rings.

Now don't get me wrong, the actual beef hot dog was AMAZING!! I love that it's char-grilled. It reminds me of a summer bbq, but the fries were terrible and because my hot dog order was slightly messed up I can't give this place high reviews. I'll stick to Lobby's for their delicious fries and CHICAGO STYLE hot dogs (which I love)... but if I'm in the mood for something char-grilled I'll definitely come to Teds again... though I'll watch them make my hot dog step by step so they don't mess it up.",

The line can be out the door 7 days a week, but you know you will be through in 10 minutes, with your order right. After all, it is being prepared RIGHT in front of you! Milkshakes are great, made to order. Onion rings are pure perfection, and although I never say no to onion rings for fries, the few times I have had them they are thin, not too oily, and the cheese dipping sauce is pure perfection. the closest you'll get in AZ to a Sabrett hot dog stand.

There are certain \"comfort\" foods that I can not find here in Phoenix, good hot dogs, a good fish fry, Beef on 'Weck, thick crust pizza, Anderson's ice cream (people from the Buffalo area know exactly what I am talking about). About 12 years, the COO of the company I managed took me out to lunch for my birthday. I did a double take when he pulled into Ted's. It was like I was home! To be able to eat a Ted's dog  slightly charred and covered with their famous hot sauce was just like reliving my time spent in Buffalo, where most Saturday's lunch was stopping at one of the many Ted's in the area. To taste the flavor of that Sahlen's hot dog was food heaven.  That was 12 years ago, and Ted's is always a go to place for lunch. My wife even will say, \"let's go to Ted's, I want a char grilled dog\". I have tasted all their various kinds of dogs and sausages and they are all excellent quality and flavor.There is something special about a dog cooked over charcoal. However, I have never had a hamburger there. If I want a burger, I will go to a burger joint. Enjoy Ted's fellow foodies! I have been eating at Ted's here in Tempe for 12 years on a regular basis and have never been disappointed. Once you bite into a Ted's hot dog and get that slight \"snap\", you know you are about to eat a excellent quality tasting hot dog.",

    "text": "Ahh Ted's...where to begin.  For me it all started on a warm August day in the late eighties.  I was heading north from Tucson to start my undergrad career at ASU and the friend I was following drove straight to Ted's instead of Manzanita (Spanish for \"tall ugly dorm with many drunk kids\").  Thus began a love affair that only grows stronger to this day.  Footlong Chili Dogs got me through a lot of hangovers and somewhere along the way college came and went, grunge came and went and my mullet came and went.  Then after college it was the All Beef Jumbo that got me through the trials and tribulations of being young, single, and semi-gainfully employed -- a few less hangovers, but still plenty of nitrates.  Then as a slightly older family man the White Hot has emerged as the sausage of choice for weekend trips with the Toddlers.  I even purchased my most recent residence perhaps partially because Spiro (the owner and son of \"The Ted\") lives across the street (ok - so maybe not the best approach to real estate decisions, but clealy Hot Dog obsessions can't be blamed for the entire real estate bubble).  This place is one of the last old school ASU spots and I pray that Spiro has a succession plan in place if he ever decides to retire.  Update: It just occured to me that this posting could be a bit more \"review-ish\" and a bit less autobiographical, so here goes.  All the aftermentioned dogs are awesome.  The condiments are perfect...the mustard and \"hot sauce\" are proprietary and worth purchasing in jars to take home (the white hot with mustard, hot sauce, onions, and a pickel is as good as it gets).  The Chili is ideally matched with cheese and onions on the regular, footlong, and all beef jumbo.  The onion rings are the best in town.  The only complaint I have is the liquid cheese, but I've come to accept and even appreciate it a bit over the years.  The milkshakes are good, but a bit small for the price.  There...hopefully that's enough superlatives.  Get there before noon to avoid the lines.",

You can watch the highly sharpened forks go to work on the dogs as sort of a show before getting your food.  This place has thrived on the corner of McClintock and Broadway for many years.  A very limited menu and the dogs great taste make the difference here.  As for the downside, this Chicago guy likes his dog with the sport peppers.  Jalepenos are close, but not the same...and I miss the neon green relish and especially the poppy seed bun.  The dog itself tastes great.  Less satisfying where the onion rings...a greasy mess and the fries are just average.  Still, the place is packed during lunch as hoards from all professions descend on the corner.

And I guess as far as char-grilled hotdogs and diner burgers go, they really are quite satisfying, although subject to the occasional stale bun or overfried side.  So why can't I get myself to give it 4 stars, despite about 15 visits over the last 13 years?  Is it the crowds? Is it the patently obvious middling meat quality? Is it the value (or lack of value) per item for stuff that isn't particularly difficult to imitate - and imitate perfectly  - at home? Is it the distance from where I live (north Phoenix, although I lived for many years in Tempe)? Is it the lighting, the short-order style line, or posters on the wall?  I dunno.  I really don't.  But whatever it is (perhaps its the cumulative effect of all-of-the-above, none of which are too troubling individually), I uniformly have an A-OK yet ho-hum visit whenever I go to Ted's.  I suppose when nothing short of a hot dog will do, I will continue to go there, but I wouldn't drive 25 miles out of my way to pay $32.50 for a family of four for good (but not great) picnic food.  *sigh*",

    "text": "My family went to Ted's this weekend. We have been avoiding it because we dislike cash only establishments, unfortunately we can now avoid it because we don't much care for Ted's.   I am from Upstate NY and I definately want to support bringing culturally pleasing (to me) food out to the desert. Knowing Ted's is from \"back home\" (since 1929), this encouraged me to break with our no cash only policy, besides I had to know if their hot dogs were better than the ones I import from Rochester to Arizona a few times a  year. It's expensive to bring Zweigles (since 1880) to Arizona and if there is a local replacement I was ready to find out.  First the ordering of our food was confusing. The person on the grill heard the first two items and then started talking to others in line to take their orders and I wasn't done yet. It wasn't like I paused, it was like he just heard all he wanted from me and moved on. I had to interrupt the ordering going on after me and say, Hey! I'm not done yet. This annoyed him, obviously. But I couldn't believe it when I started to order the rest, It didn't seem like he was paying any attention becuase mid sentance he started talking cheese with the people in front of me!  Ahem... we need two white hots, two footlongs, two corn dogs, three medium logenberry's, a chocolate shake and an onion ring please...  Next thing I know we are at the condiment section and the guy is putting stuff on my dogs I haven't even told him yet what I want on them!  Excuse me, I want to put Weber's mustard on that white hot. The grill guy yells over to me, \"We don't use Weber's, if you don't want yellow you can pump out the spicy mustard over by the straw station.\"   They don't use the mustard they are advertising in the window? They don't have the spicy mustard at their own condiment station? In the meantime the register girl has already totalled my order and my order hasn't even been made yet, so of course it's not correct. I said, it's not all here yet. This puzzled her. I said I am still waiitng for the corn dogs, the drinks , the onion rings and the chocolate shake. She started over and came up with a second total, also wrong. The shake came in a tiny size, they said they are one size only. Who knew.  The register girl screwed up the change as well. Good thing I didn't just swipe a card and get screwed not paying attention.  We got to the table determined to see if the food was worth the aggravation. Since the toppings were not done right and the onion rings were very undercooked and a gnarled mess I was really hoping the white hot dogs flavor would kick ass. This was my main reason for coming. It was a decent dog, but it was not better than the ones I have shipped in to my house.  Amazingly enough the best tasting of the dogs we bought were the corndogs! What a surprise. But not worth driving out to Ted's and having cash ready for them. As for the shake, it rivaled McDonalds to me and I'd be happier getting a mondo size Chocolate Peanut Butter delight from Lenny's.  So for atmosphere, service, food and cost it just doesn't rate more than the two stars I gave it. Looks like I haven't found a way to replace my multi year shipment for back east brats, dogs, etc. with a local alternative. Sorry Ted's.",

I've heard my coworkers talk about the dogs, and on more than one occasion seen astronomical lines at the counter, so I thought why not, it had to be good, right?  Talk about sticker shock, and only for a single dog?  Very overpriced indeed, on top of that, they managed to complicate a simple hot dog.  Various types of meats and topping options were a bit confusing, not because there were too many choices, but because non of them were really explained.  A little annoying for a first timer customer.  The dogs themselves are not bad, but I think you'd have to a complete idiot to mess up a hot dog.  I still don't get whats so amazing about it, definitely way too overpriced, won't go again.  They can keep their wieners and shove it!",

I love the atmosphere at Ted's. It's an old school hot dog joint that hasn't been updated in years, luckily. There is almost always a long line but it's worth the wait. The boyfriend and I always get regular hot dogs and and order or fries and an order of onion rings to share.   Now their hot dogs are good, don't get me wrong, but they are char grilled so sometime I feel they get a little over done. Some people would say that kinda \"burnt\" quality is what makes it good but a few times my hot dog has been a little too charred. Their sides however are the best! They have skinny fries that are crisp and yummy and their onion rings aren't really rings it is more like onion strings. Sweet, salty, thin, greasy goodness. Get ranch or a side of cheese sauce for dipping - so good.  Ted's is one of those places you have to go to at least once, it's sort of a Tempe institution.",

They have all sorts of incarnations of hotdogs and have a great selection of condiments and fixings to go on top. All the ingredients are top notch quality.  I usually go with the Bratwurst, but you can't really go wrong.  The onions and peppers are a great touch, with the sauce being the best part. I'm pretty sure they sell it by the bottle.  The same guy is working away at the grill everytime I've been, and he is definitely the best at grilling dogs I've witnessed.   *Mental note - Pick up a bottle next trip*",

I had 2 regular hot dogs, fries and a soda. I love char grilled food, so I enjoyed my hot dogs. I especially loved the spicy relish!! It was perfect, not overwhelming at all. The fries were nice and crispy, maybe a little too greasy for my taste. I moved here from NYC were Papaya's is the hot dog king and I do like them better.  That being said, I liked Ted's and will visit again. Next time, I'll ask for extra spicy relish.",

I'm fairly certain that I will die before age 40, of some hard-hearted condition related to my perpetual consumption of fatty foods.   For this reason it is perhaps ironic that the one soft spot in my otherwise much-maligned heart is for hot dogs and burgers cooked over an open flame.   It's no surprise then that I'll be going back to Ted's.  Like a phillistine, I had a chesseburger but it was tasty.  The onion rings are also good, much more to my taste than traditional O-rings.     Long lines and no ranch makes for 4, rather than 5 stars.  But the staff was friendly, the food priced right and the ambiance fun and lively.  I definitely recommend Ted's.",

Yeah, the dogs are pricey but they are cooked in front of you and there's a choice of beef dogs or pork. Onion rings and fries are side options.  For an old building it's kept very clean. You don't seem to find yourself cleaning up someone else's mess just so you can sit down. Of course I avoid the place during weekday lunch crowds where the line gets pretty long.   I like the \"What can I get you?\" New York deli ordering style that they employ to get the line moving quicker. Once one customer's order is thrown on the grill they're asking the next person in line what they want whether that person is standing up at the counter or not.  It''s efficient and keeps the line moving.",

They have regulars, all beef, foot longs, bratwurst, and sausage. ALL are fantastic. They have a wide selection of toppings. Ketchup, mustard, relish, tomatoes, pickles, onions, kraut, chili, and cheese. I am sure I left some out. The restaurant looks like they transported it from up state New York. The fries are good but the onion rings are REALLY good. They have ice cream shakes and other drinks. They also have a unique Loganberry drink. I guess I am a novice of Loganberry, but it tasted like a grape juice fruit punch to me.   If you go at the wrong time the lines will be long. It is worth the wait for sure. The lines are long because if you want a hot dog, this is the place to go. I highly recommend Teds to fans of char broiled Hot Dogs or Hot Dog lovers in general.",

There aren't a whole lot of choices but what they have is really fresh and good. I love all beef hot dogs charbroiled (as in made on an actual grill) and this place didn't miss a beat. The onion rings were a mount of fried goodness. The malts were made with real ice cream and milk. Delicious.  The service was great too. Simply a line of people smiling and cooking the dogs to order. Another smiling face topping your hot dog with deliciousness. Then the cashier who is friendly and quick. On top of that you have a couple of people running around compiling the order.   The atmosphere is pretty cool too. Nice new york meets arizona decor. Kind of sporty. A great place for some cheap grub. Lots of different kinds of people there too which was great. We had college folks, little kids with their parents, some elders and a few middle aged folks. This is basic, good food with a nice atmosphere for a decent price.",

Skinny winners,uninspired hamburgers,I have ate here four times,not worth the drive.I can't believe people give this place 5 stars,makes me wonder where they normally dine.",

    "text": "If you like good old fashioned hot dogs and hamburgers, you need to stop by Ted's when in the area.  Simple food, grilled the right way, in front of you with real hardwood charcoal.  It's all about the tech, the prodding, poking and scraping of the dog while its grilling, gives it that perfect consistency.  I've been coming to Ted's for over a decade and I can say they've never done me wrong.  The fries and onion strings are delicious, not sure if they do a half and half bag but that would be awesome, because the portion is huge.  I try and stop by when I'm in the area, I used to frequent this place weekly when I lived in Tempe years ago.  It's will definitely satisfy any hot dog or burger cravings!!",

My boyfriend and I got a foot long with onion rings on top, fries on the side and a drink (total of $10!!) By the way, the onion rings are made fresh daily, very good. We got some sauerkraut on the side (since I don't like it that much) and it was not good. However, the sausage was perfectly cooked and grilled!  Maybe next time we will try to go there when it is not lunch time!",

First this place is very near for Arizona state universe, also is very near for my home, I am live in Broadway road, walk to ted's hot dog maybe 15 minutes, I think that is great, when the finish to the eat, we can walk to home, this is fitness.  We are arrived to ted's hot dog in 8:44 Pm, eat for dinner. May be the time was a litter late, not have more customers in the shop. But the shop is very clean, you can feel the shop is regular store.  Ok, we are chosen for eat, they have a lot of options for their dogs and burger, of course, this is hot dog store, I am chosen the foot-long dog, fries and drink, total is 9.37 dollars add the tax. The hot dog just has 4.09 dollars, a big one, I think that is a pretty decent price, and when I finish eat for that, I am full. You can add more lettuce, tomato, onion if you want, but I do not like pickles, so not add pickles. About the fries, I am buy large fries just need 2.49 dollars, it is large, I think the large fries is better for McDonald's. and my friend buy the bacon cheese fries, that is look very delicious, fries and ketchup is perfect march. The hot dog look is very big and juicy. The service is very passionate, employees will be very patiently waiting for your choice, we are just wait 3 minted for we are food and I am talk for my friend not one disturb us. Overall, lots of options, delicious food and a pretty decent price. Have passionate and very nice service I think you can to try.,",

The girl putting the onion ring on the burger rushed the burger to the tray so the top roll fell on the dirty counter. No one apologized for that or the food getting cold. They also spilled the guy behind me's pickle from his hot dog on the counter.  Today's crew needs some re-training. Best part was the lady cleaning tables. She was very courteous.",

If you want a no frills burger and fries or hot dog and onion rings with a hearty creamy milkshake, this is the place for you.  The onion rings are some of the best I've ever had.  They are flaky and thin and very crispy.  I love the sweet and spicy sauce to dip them in.  That sauce is also great on a burger.  I wasn't a huge fan of the hot dog.  It didn't have a ton of flavor.  The burger is the way to go in my opinion.  There is a large array of toppings and sauces you can get to customize it as well.",

You waiting line in front of the grill and tell them what you want off of their simple, easy menu.  I ordered an all beef with chili and cheese and right before my eyes, I see him pull a fresh dog out and start to cook it over the hot coals. Pretty cool, I must say.   One thing I have to give a shout out about, HOW CLEAN THE GRILL HOODS WERE!!! For being over open coals and with the volume of business they do (was busy when we were there), those hoods were sparkling CLEAN!! To keep hoods clean in any restaurant, you clean them like bi weekly... these things look like they are polished daily!!! great job!!   Back to the dogs- The chili and cheese are added right in front of you, as well as a lot of other fix-ins (if you ask). Mine came out just the right temperature and the chili and cheese were awesome! chili was flavorful and tasty, not too spicy. Dog was juicy and the bun was soft but stable. We ordered onion rings (which were not traditional but really good) and some potato salad. I was not a fan of the potato salad (it was lacking in basic spices, as well as it needed more mustard to tang it up) but that's okay, I would still go back for the dogs and rings!   Reasonably priced, a pretty quick place to grab a hot dog/bratwurst, just like from a family 4th of july bbq!",

Their chocolate malt is this weird color of diarrhea, but again, don't let that fool you, because it's pretty cold and thick and tastes really good, but then, what's up with the off color? It's a shade you just wouldn't expect. When it's super busy, they run the risk of paper and junk on the floor but I saw an employee trying to keep up with picking it up.

If you show up at the lunch rush plan on at least a 15 minute wait until you can get your order in. But it's worth it!  Two do not's: 1. DO NOT put ketchup on your hotdog! That is hotdog treason. 2. On a more serious note, if you feel like a hotdog but there is an ASU game about to start, DO NOT show up at Ted's! Very long lines (over half hour just to order) on ASU game days. Just wait until it is closer to game time when everyone has cleared out.",

Even worse, as I stepped up to order, I said, \"I heard the burgers here were really good!\" and the guy working replied \"oh, who told you that?\" and looked genuinely surprised. Well his reaction basically summed up my experience there. I'm not sure why this place has such high reviews, maybe the dogs are better.",

The hot dogs Ted's serves are amazing. I love everything about this place. The retro vibe, the big grill right in front of the customers, the hot sauce.. The list goes on and on. I highly recommend the white hot with mustard, ketchup, cheese sauce, and hot sauce and the regular hot dog with mustard, ketchup, onion, & a pickle. Both the fries and the onion rings are great so you can't go wrong with either. Also recommend getting some cheese to go along with said fries!",

I cannot stand when hot dogs roll around a flat top in grease, or sit in hot water, charcoal is the way to go. Makes the skin super crispy and gives it the snap everyone should be looking for in a hot dog. I always get mine with ketchup, mustard, onions, and dill pickle. Skinny fries with malt vinegar and a side of cheese. If you haven't tried their loganberry, do it. Some say it tastes like flat Dr. Pepper, myself, I feel it's a cross between concord grape juice and fruit punch. Delicious!  I wish they would open one in Las Vegas, but until then, we'll keep visiting every time we're in town.",

Service was super quick and the staff is really friendly. Either they put on a good show or genuinely enjoy working there. Added toppings to my heart's desire, even some peppers and onions which I guess were supposed to cost extra but they let me have for free ninety-nine. My only qualm is that it is cooked with the meat varieties. So if you're like offended by that sort of thing..well..I'm not even sure why you'd be eating there to begin with. It's only mildly bothersome to me. My boyfriend order a hot dog and fries as well. Our food was delicious. It's honestly one of the better veggie dogs I've had. Almost like a corn dog-type flavor. The fries were fresh and made to order.   Overall a cool Tempe mainstay that I'd recommend to get your hot dog fix. Super affordable, fast & friendly service and most importantly, good food.",

Walked in the door, straight to the grill and ordered a White Hot Dog and a Jumbo All Beef. Stand in line until your dogs come ready and you get asked what topping you want. I got the peppers and onions that come with the white hot plus deli mustard and the jumbo dog got topped with mayo, mustard, sauerkraut, and a pickle. Potato salad on the side and passed on some on delicious looking shakes for the soda water machine. Both hot dogs were perfectly cooked, slightly charted on the outside, crisp snappy casings to bite into but I do think they poked a little too much during cooking and could be juicier if maybe not prodded so much. Still an amazing hot dog, with great choices for toppings. The potato salad was light and tasty also with good proportions of ingredients in every bite. I will keep being a happy customer of Ted's Hot Dogs into the future!!!",

The staff were friendly and my kids really enjoyed the corn dogs. The two things I enjoyed the most were the onion rings and the atmosphere. None of the meal would have been nearly as good without the old time feeling and watching my food cook in front of me on the grill. I will be back and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a laid back place to bring the young ones.  I often feel out of place when I take my kids to restaurants but not here. I look forward to my next visit.",

Decor- overall the restaurant is pretty cozy, made with plenty of seating inside, and some outside. Nothing too special, some decor on walls, but mostly made to have you sit, eat, and get out. The menu is on the wall, and somewhat easy to figure out.  Customer service- So I went to lunch and it was pretty busy. The line was at the door, so they had someone come out and take orders so the food would be ready when you arrive to the cashier. Friendly overall, nothing special though.  Food- LOVED the dogs, especially for the price. They were juicy, plump, and the onion rings are amazingly fresh! The only thing I wasn't excited about was the mac and cheese. Pretty bland, but can't complain too much.  Overall---- This place was well worth the trip for me. Make sure to be able to set aside time for their peak times, the line will be long. Their food is cooked to order, which I love. I have to return for their milkshakes and malts soon!!!",

Make sure your fries are hot when you get them . Other than that, it's a great little hot dog stop. Toppings are gratis except chili cheese.",

There are a plethora of toppings to choose from, and they now have mac and cheese as a side (Or even topping!) in addition to fries and their heavenly onion rings.

As your waiting in line the  person on the grill will ask you what you would like to order, it's not really shouting but more of a long distance conversation. I actually found ordering that way to be kind of fun.  The hotdogs are shipped in from Buffalo, NY. The charbroiled hot dog have a great flavor and there are so many toppings to choose from. I had one with homemade chili, cheese and onions. It was fantastic. I especially liked the chili.

Topped the sausages with mustard and onions and the all beef dog with mustard, onion, relish and hot sauce.  Washed it down with a Diet Coke.   While I was eating, I overheard a conversation a few tables over.  This lady and man asked this group how they liked the food etc.  Turns out, the people asking the questions were one of Teds Grandaughters and the CEO of Teds.  Pretty cool stuff!  Second trip, I got the United Nations of Sausages........ Italian (Italy), Bratwurst (Germany), and a Polish (Poland).  I got all 3 topped with mustard, onion and hot sauce.  I had an online coupon for free fries too.  Washed it down with a Diet Coke.    I can't say enough about Ted's Hot Dogs.  They are without a doubt my favorite food in AZ and I will continue to come here.  Once I move out here in a few weeks, its going to take some major willpower to keep me away from this place.

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  You might wonder how this place gets the same star rating from me as Steak 44 given that it's a hot dog.  I don't compare the two to each other, I compare this place to other hot dog joints.  And this is a fine example.  I love the fact that this is the only outpost not in Upstate New York.  I love the fact that they char-grill their hot dogs.  I love the variety of sausages they have.  It's not the best hot dog I've ever had, but it is mighty tasty.  I typically opt for a bratwurst with mustard and sauerkraut, or an all beef (various toppings), or the white hot (perhaps their most underrated sausage.)  The casing is great.  Even with the mauling that they do on the grill with your dog, there is still a great snap when you bite into the hot dog, and the smokiness from the charcoal is perhaps the best part of the experience.  I am not as huge a fan of the onion rings as most people are.  I like the fact that it is mostly onion - I don't like how flimsy they get most times.  I am also not a fan, generally, of their fries.  I am a fan of their milkshakes.  It is, I believe, one of the best in the Valley.  Eminently sippable (unlike the solid hunk you get at In n Out), it tastes like a classic milkshake should - ice creamy without too much ice cream, good milk, well blended.  This place is close to the perfect hot dog, but it's not quire there yet.  But rest assured you should never be disappointed for coming to a hot dog joint like this.",

Once there, you are asked to choose one or all toppings from a huge selection included in the price.  Pickles, onions raw and grilled, peppercini, tomatoes, marinated peppers, chili to die for, bacon (xtra $), various custom sauces, and the usual array of mustard, ketchup, pickle relish, sport peppers, celery salt, etc. etc.  Fresh house made onion rings, french fries, burgers, chicken sandwiches, and other assorted items are also on the menu.

But we never stopped in because we were thinking, \"It's just hot dogs, how good could it really be?\" That is, until today. Being the official National Hot Dog Day we figured we'd finally give it a try - and wow, we were missing out.   The first thing we noticed was how busy it was for a weekday afternoon, with a line going nearly out the door! Even with a long line, the menu had so many choices we still hadn't decided by the time we got to the front. They had an insane amount of options just for toppings, but what immediately caught my eye was two of my favorite things in the food world - mac & cheese, and bacon. I was a little skeptical at first using mac & cheese as a topping for a hot dog, thinking it would taste really processed or too mushy like at other places, but it was absolutely delicious! My boyfriend ordered the same but got the foot-long whereas I got the regular size, and he enjoyed it just as much as I did. The only complaint we had was the price was a little expensive for what it was, but we were still fairly satisfied.  If the rest of their menu is even half as good as what we had today - there were burgers, ice cream, soups for the fall season - then we will definitely be back soon!",

I had never been disappointed enough to review this place until recently.   We had stopped coming for a very long time since Hotdogs aren't normally in our dietary preference. However, we were seriously enwrapped in Pokemon Go, and they had a Pokemon Gym in these premises.   What a great way to enjoy a Hot Dog, and play our favorite game. We went on two consecutive occasions. Both were on a Sunday evening. Busy, but not too busy.  The first time around, the Hot Dog guy was efficient. The Onion Ring guy had a 'tude, and the cashier seemed like every customer was just a bother to her.  We both had the Hot Dogs. Mine was plain, and my wife's was the Chili Dog. We had our normal drinks, and I had a Strawberry Shake.  The Hot Dogs were just \"meh\" (in comparison to say, Short Leash), but everything else was okay. Nothing to write home about, and we even ignored the front desk help. We were too excited and engrossed in our Gym battles that we didn't pay much attention.  However, the next Sunday we went there. We got an even worse reception. The Hot Dog guy was on par again, but the cashier (it was a different girl, this time) was just too rude and impolite. And she forgot my wife's drink, and she threw an attitude when my wife asked for it, as if she was really being put out. I went up there and said something as I picked up the food, vowing to never to return to this establishment.  However, they left me a parting gift because the next morning, I basically heaved the Hot Dog that I ate, and everything else that came with it. I was literally sick all day, and had stomach issues for several days. And I have eaten foods in so many countries, that I don't normally react this way to bad food. Not sure if it was the Hot Dog, the Onion Rings, or the Milk Shake, but something from this place didn't agree with me to a great degree!  Hence, this will be our last visit to this Tempe icon. It has definitely fallen off our dining pedestal, and has fractured a leg!",

The hot dog was okay, shake was good, the fries were ok, the onion rings were not good. Long line at 1100 a.m. on a Saturday.  The next time I took company. We had regular hot dogs, a sea dog, a brat, a jumbo dog, large order of fries and a strawberry shake. Start with the good, the strawberry shake was delicious. Same as last time, the regular hot dogs were ok. The rest was not. The fries seemed to be the end of the batch and didn't seem like a large. The brat and the jumbo dog were not great. The sea dog was terrible. All this after a long line and a $30 bill.  Won't be back.",

Loved the Bratwurst and Hamburgers that are grilled over a flame to give it the real bbq grill taste.   When they are finished cooking your order then you tell them what to put on your burger or hotdog. Good selection of fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions and many other items.  Had their french fries which were nice and crispy and a generous amount.   Ate here around 300 pm so it was not to busy which was nice to not have to fight the crowds.  The cooks are pretty pushy so be ready when your food is ready.  Will not take such a long time to eat here again and be back soon",

I love the food, the people, and now the stellar atmosphere. My daughter was just as excited about her food and the new kids club they implemented.

I assumed that a place that specializes in charred hot dogs and burgers would actually make their own dogs OR bread and not use store bought bread and hot dogs. I literally saw them pull out the buns from a Orowheat Bag you would find in the grocery store. Buns were thin and soggy, and the hot dog was average. Tasted EXACTLY like one you can make yourself at home. The fries were ok but not very flavorful and the onion rings were gross and soggy. I was actually kind of offended when I realized we spent over $20 on a meal made of prepackaged foods from the grocery store. I do not understand why this place is so highly reviewed or why they claim to have the best dogs for 90 years. This place does not even compare to Simons Hot dogs in old town. They have fresh buns and delicious hot dogs and toppings that they make themselves instead of buying everything pre made. Defiantly will not be back.",

The hot dog was just okay but felt that I could have made a better choice by picking something else. Cheese fries were decent and I did like how the cheese came in a separate container cup. The vanilla shake was one of the best shakes that I've had and I have gone through plenty of milkshakes over the years in my travels. I will definitely be coming back to get that again.  There's not too much of an atmosphere here as there is more emphasis on them serving customers and it can hard to find an available table when it's busy. However this seems like a great spot for take-out as the food is prepared rather quickly. This restaurant has been here for many years and it's easy to see why it has been around for so long.",

I found Ted's Hot Dogs after scouring Yelp for hot dog places nearby. After checking the menu of ten different hot dog places, I finally can across Ted's.   I brought a non-veggie friend to try it out. I ordered the veggie dog, and my friend and I split some fries and some onion rings. I was in heaven. The hot dog was amazing, and they dressed it up exactly like I wanted it. The fries were thin (sort of like shoestring fries), which I actually like because they're great for dunking. The onion rings, however, on my first trip were awful. They were little more than greasy onions with little batter. On my next trip, I skipped the onion rings. I'm very glad that I decided to try again, though, because when I returned to Ted's yesterday, I ordered them and they were absolutely amazing. These rings were properly breaded and they tasted perfect. I believe they're made right in the store, as they're wrapped in wax paper.  Long story short...the prices are amazing, the food is good, and this place is vegetarian-friendly. I'm very happy with this place and will definitely be returning on a regular basis.",

I'm not a huge hot dog fan, but when I want one, I want one grilled and slightly charred. That's what I got.  The fries and onion strings were SO good. Hot and crispy and full of flavor. Not a lot of fancy anything, just your classic hot dog toppings, simple fries and onion rings (when you do it right you don't need to cover it up).  They also have burgers and shakes. Must try next time.",

Any type of sausage, dog, or brat you can think of. They grill it the way you want it too, so if you want it burnt, speak up! They use Aunt Hattie's bread which is okay in my book. It usually gets loud and crowded which is atmosphere here. It's basically the Subway of hot dogs (well, maybe Subway isn't cool enough, let's say Cheba Hut), you tell them what you want on it after it's done grilling. The onion rings are huge!",

I planned to get another one, but noticed about 35 people waiting in line. I decided to wait it out, sat in my car, I needed to make some phone calls anyway.  Flash forward an hour later, the line is still around 30 people, and no, not the same people. The line is constantly flowing. I don't understand how the cook can keep track of who ordered what, but he does.  The second time around for lunch, I took an Italian dog to go. By the time I got my dog, the line was still all the way across the lobby. I saw a few people come and go without waiting, I assume that they did not want to wait.  I love how they BBQ the dog as they are ordered.  If I lived in Tempe, or even in a nearby area, I think I would go there often. I about 8 hours away. I will add this place to my list of places to go whenever in the Phoenix area.  The ONLY complaint I can find about this place is the long line. The problem with that complaint, is that the cause of the complaint is a direct result of every compliment that be made about this place.  This place kind of make think of an \"American\" version of Tito's Tacos (In Los Angeles on Sepulveda Place) in the aspect of simple delicious food, fast service.",

We got down there and waited in the usual line but it smells so wonderful with the burgers and hotdogs on the grill. The wait was very short and actually took our order as we waited in line with the tablet. Hot dogs are still unbelievably great felt like I was a little kid again. The french fries were monstrous and quantity and I got the sweet and spicy sauce which is like a fry sauce on the side went perfect with them. My wife gave me some of her onion rings to share and they were equally as good. Before I end this review I've got to say their malts are the best I've ever had outside of New York City. Even the staff came by to ask if they could take our trays for us and we're so courteous as we're getting our meal. One of the best places we're eating that in a very long time get to know the more things change the more they stay the same",

If you want to order like a pro you could do this... wait in line , when the person grilling makes eye contact with you speak clearly your order.  If you want my advice order this way... \"2 regular dogs and rings\", you will then be shuffled down the line.  When they ask you how you want your 2 regular dogs I suggest this.... One with hot sauce, onions, chili and cheese, and one with hot sauce, mustard, onions, and pickle.  That is the way I have done it since I was a little kid,  This place is 5 star.",

I came in tonight after 2 years of loving out of state. The place looks the same.. but it's a complete joke. There is posters everywhere about the \"new triple burger\" and other fast food nonsense.   It turned into a wendys. Food quality dropped. My onion rings are awful. Service was the worst thing I have ever seen. They never put my dog even on the grill. This used to have the best service ever.   When I was in college I moved to the apartments across the street just so I could enjoy my favorite hot dog.  RIP Spearo; miss you as the owner. Now it's just a sub par hot dog stand in Buffalo",

I think they could improve the buns that they use. I live very, very close by, but I don't come as often because the buns just don't do it for me. Growing up around Chicago, I've become very partial to the type of buns they use at Portillo's or at Hot Doug's.  Plenty of patio tables and lots of seating inside. This place is good for groups, a pair, or just by yourself but I wouldn't really call it a date spot.",

I love the bratwurst and traditional hotdog. The homemade chili is great. The fries are fresh and they go great with hot cheese sauce. There are plenty of condiments to choose from and the grilled peppers and onions are fresh. They also use high-quality sauerkraut. We also have a picky eater in the family so I appreciate that Ted's has a skinless hotdog.   I appreciate the ambiance as well. It has a very authentic New York feel. And even when there is a huge line the staff is very efficient and moves through the orders quickly. You would think this may cause some mistakes but we've never had a mistake with our order, which is even more impressive considering we usually have all kinds of specialty requests and directions.   I highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "I've said this about Chicago vs. NY pizza and the same is True about Chicago vs east coast hot dogs.  To argue which is \"better\" is the same as arguing if a vacation is better in the mountains or the seashore.  WHY do people waste their time (and our time) trying to compare apples & oranges?  If you love your beloved regional favorite, why do you waste time, energy and money eating what you know you're going to hate, then waste our time rating it only a 1-star?  One such review on Yelp was one that listed their personal choice of what a Chicago hot dog is supposed to be like (while comparing it to a WNY hot dog) and \"screamed\" in ALL CAPS that for a real Chicago dog \"NO SUBSTITUTIONS ARE ALLOWED\".  Yeech.  Really?  You will only eat it the way somebody else tells you it should be eaten?  I can see why someone like that would rate Ted's 1-star.  Now welcome to Ted's in Tempe.  I'm proudly from Buffalo where Ted's was invented and still owns what a real hot dog should taste like.  I also lived in Chicago and ate those things called Chicago dogs that are boiled to the point of flavorlessness then covered with so much crap you have no idea what the hot dog tastes like.  When in Chicago, I ate as Chicagoans do and I didn't bitch and whine that their dogs didn't compare to what I was used to.  I ate them and I chose to order my own selection of condiments.  Ted's in Tempe?   Well, it is the only Ted's outside of the Buffalo, NY area, opened by Ted himself after his retirement.  Including the Tempe location they are a tiny family-owned group of Buffalo-area hot dog stands. They are absolutely True to what a real WNY hot dog tastes like and they don't wimp out and try to please the Midwesterners who wander in by mistake and think they can order a Chicago dog ... not gonna happen.  I don't have a favorite at Ted's. I am a sucker for White Hots (yeah I know, people outside of WNY have no idea what that is).  But my choice usually comes back to the footlong which is lovingly charbroiled (I know, people outside of WNY think you are a space alien if you charbroil a hot dog).  Unlike Chicagoans who were're advised like to be told how to eat a hot dog, Ted's has plenty of choices to make your dog personal.  I have my choice ... mustard, RED relish (no folks it's not hot sauce, it's a special relish unique to WNY, and it's also not chili, it's relish) and a pickle spear on the dog.  People who kill their dogs with a ton of crap should be reported to PETA ;-)  Ted's onion rings are the gold standard, and yes dang you, they are greasy like a good onion ring should be!  And I can't resist a large serving of loganberry pop (I'll wait while you Google what I mean by \"pop\").  People, Ted's is hot dog history and those of us who go to the Tempe location are lucky beyond words.  And (sorry if I offend anyone) but Ted's should not ever \"expand\" and franchise and open a location in Dubuque.  If you want the one and only you have to come to Tempe or go to Buffalo.  Otherwise, settle for what you can get elsewhere and wish you were at Ted's.",

First of all, the staff was the worst staff I've ever came encountered with. When my friend asked what to get, because we had never been there before, all the staff literally said I dont know. Nice way to upsell guys. Then the girl cashing us out coul dnt ring up our order right. I think she was new. The tables were small and sucked. All the tables weren't wiped down or clean. Now the food. The onion rings were TERRIBLE. basically no breading, stringy, tasteless. Mac and cheese tasted and looked old. Was terrible even when I added extra cheese sauce that I had to pay for. The chili dog I got was ok. Not very flavorful. Overall, I won't ever come back and should have just asked for my money back because I totally regret spending 20 bucks on 2 hot dogs, a sise of Mac and cheese, an onion ring and one drink. Fuck this place.",

The dogs are great! The Weber's mustard is also a local Buffalo condiment. Don't forget the Ted's sauce on your dog too. It's basically a combination of ketchup with slightly spicey tomato relish. You can also get a foot long or a \"jumbo\" (really thick) hotdog. The \"Jumbo\" burgers are great too.  They serve Polish and Italian sausage too.  The onion rings are a great side.  You know the food is great here because there's always a line.                Be prepared to order your dogs, burgers etc while standing in line.  Don't  be one of those people that holds the line up by not having a clue what you want. If you've never been there before, read the menu posted above the grill area. You don't have to tell them the toppings you want until you reach the cash register area and your stuff is cooked.  After your order your dogs they will ask you if you want any fries or rings,  then later they will ask what you want to drink.  This type of ordering confuses some people.  It keeps the line moving, so play along and enjoy some great dogs!

This is NOTHING like Pink's.  Pink's is like the Disneyland of hotdogs and has a wide selection of creative dogs that are worth standing in line for.  Ted's has a good solid hotdog, but definitely not worth any significant wait (which, fortunately, there was none when we went)  Mostly the options are: regular, footlong and all-beef.  Toppings were chili, cheese, ketchup, mustard (spicy and regular), onions, pickles and onions/peppers.They also have sausages (Italian, bratwurst, and others), but they weren't worth mentioning.  Definitely just get one of the hotdogs.  The buns were fresh, the onion rings are good (they're the thinly sliced, non-stiff kind) and my vanilla shake was pretty good.  But DEFINITELY not Pink's or anything amazing.  I thought Abu's review below was pretty harsh, but I hate to admit it, but he's closer to the mark than the 5 stars on here.",
