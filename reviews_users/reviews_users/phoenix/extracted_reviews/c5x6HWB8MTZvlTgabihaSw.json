It is Valentine's Day we had reservations at 7:30 and now we have not been seated and it is 8:00. We stood in line just to speak to the hostess and she rudely told us that everyone there has reservations. I guess greed got the best of them and they overbooked with no concern of what it would do to people's Valentines plans. It is getting later and later we have been forced to leave and wait over an hour at another restaurant. We will never be going back after 20 years of going to this restaurant.",

The Ossobucco was the major disappointment, A beautiful Presentation that lacked flavor and was past overcooked. One of my favorite dishes when prepared correctly, but they just missed - badly!  On the plus side the Gnocchi were little pillows of wonderfulness! Reminded me on our neighborhood  \"little Italian lady\" who made it for me as a child over 60 years ago and was, until now, the very best I have ever had. This version was very close and was served with a wonderful four cheese white sauce (calorie free for certain!). The Caesar Salad was a decent rendition but nothing I have eaten here approached the Gnocchi, unfortunately.  Worth the trip for the Gnocchi alone!",

    "text": "Very enjoyable meal; we'll be back.  Chose Arrivederci based on Yelp reviews; arrived hopeful and wasn't disappointed. Smallish (about 30 tables) with a definite non-chain old world Italian restaurant feel to it.   Service was excellent - greeted with an honest smile on arrival and it continued throughout our meal. Casual but respectful, and very attentive. Perfect.   I had the Hess Cab and my partner had the Kendall Jackson Chardonnay, both about $9. Wine list was small but adequate with a good spread. The Hess was excellent.   Hot dinner rolls arrived with a pesto/tomato dipping sauce that was excellent. We then split the antipasto tray, all very good.   For entrees I had the lobster ravioli special and my partner had the grouper in saffron sauce; both were excellent and quite rich but not overdone. My mixed field greens side salad with Gorgonzola dressing was crisp and fresh.   The busboy arrived at just the right time: when clearly we were both finished yet without sitting for an extended period when we were. None of the picking up one of the diner's plates while others are still eating which has become the norm and yet is so rude.   Our waiter then arrived a minute later with a couple of small glasses of Limoncello, what a perfect touch.   We were tempted by the desserts but just couldn't manage it. Next time.   This is what an upscale family Italian restaurant is all about folks. If you're looking for a huge, chain style place like Brio (where the food isn't bad) with decent but sterile service and a room big enough to seat hundreds, this isn't it. If however you'd like to settle-in to your cozy corner table in a place you could easily be recognized as a regular, and wrap yourself around some delicious food in an honest atmosphere, this is it. Restaurants come and go but apparently Arrivederci has been around for 17 years and I can understand why.   What a nice time we had! I only wish we lived closer, but we'll definitely be making the drive to come back.",

    "text": "We went there while we were in Scottsdale on vacation.  It had 4 stars on Yelp so we thought this would be a good Italian restaurant.  Unfortunately we were very disappointed.  We had a reservation and yet we were seated at a cramped table for 2 in a corner.    The waitress merely came to take our order.  We explained we had not been there before.  Instead of volunteering house specialties or explaining the menu she smiled still waiting for us to order.  It took several questions to determine a recommendation.  I ordered the recommended veal and my wife ordered the recommended eggplant Parmesan.  Surprisingly nothing came with the food.  The pasta on my plate was disappointing and bland.  The veal itself was paper thin and rather tasteless and tough.  The eggplant parmesan was good according to my wife but nothing special.  For a 4 star restaurant we expected better tasting food and far better service.  When it came time to pay, the waitress brought the bill and then disappeared for over twenty minutes.  Given how small the restaurant is, this was no easy feat and yet she buzzed by various tables purposely not looking our way.  The waitress seemed to be more outgoing with other tables, just not us.  It seemed pretty obvious this restaurant plays favorites and for some reason they did not take a shining to us from the very beginning.  Just so you know we are a normal looking couple who were dressed in dockers and polo shirts with no piercings or tattoos.",

    "text": "I took my family here on Sunday and must say I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  The restaurant is relatively small with about twenty five to thirty five tables.  The clientele on a Sunday night is largely graying snowbirds with the exceptional family with kids. The restaurant feels more akin to Northern California than Scottsdale, Arizona - that is a complement!   The meal began with ice water and fresh bread with pesto.  A great combination.  My son ordered the Caesar salad and minestrone soup and left nothing behind.  I had ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo con Funghi which was simply outstanding.  As a matter of fact, my wife and son ate most of my meal.  If you have the opportunity to visit this restaurant try this meal - you cannot go wrong.  My wife ordered the Rondelle 4 Formaggi which is rolled pasta, tomato sauce and rolled pasta which is pan fried.  It appears to be a light weight meal, but is truly filling.    I would say the food is a five star, the service is somewhat lackluster.  Water refills were not timely, the salad took a while to make to the table and the service is so so.  Worth trying........",

    "text": "As soon as I walked into Arrivederci in Scottsdale, I felt welcomed.  The cute, bustling Italian restaurant was cozy but elegant, with lots of chatter and linen-covered tables, and the staff at the door and servers were super-friendly. The spot is locally owned, with a second location in Ahwatukee, and my pal and I got a nice table in the corner of the restaurant to enjoy the homemade Italian food at.  We both liked how there were wine racks dividing the main dining area from the bar area, and there were pretty paintings covering the walls, while the restaurant glowed in a soft yellow light. Our server was excellent and professional, and I'd say it's a great date place if you're in the area.  We started with the Portobello Reganato con Fontina ($8.95), a mushroom topped with cheese. Our server said it was one of their most popular appetizers, and I can see why: it was plenty of food for two people to split and had a ton of cheese. The mushroom was really juicy and brought a healthier aspect to the dish, and I really enjoyed it.  Our meals came with freshly baked bread, and I ordered Ravioli Caprese Gratinati ($14.95). It was a pretty traditional cheese ravioli, and nothing really stood out to me about the dish, though my companion really liked the fresh tomato sauce it was smothered in. The pasta was thick but a great consistency-there wasn't anything wrong with it, but I've just had more memorable meals.  My guest got the Vitello Madeira con Porcini ($18.95), which was veal covered in a mushroom wine sauce and served with pasta. He said he would have preferred a cream sauce instead, which is totally available to you, but he really liked the veal.  For dessert, we had the epic chocolate tiramisu the spot offered. It was a giant slab of my favorite dessert, and it tasted pretty heavenly. Definitely get it if you go here-I could have eaten the whole thing myself!  My favorite part about dining at Arrivederci was definitely the atmosphere and the service. I love places that make you feel at home, and Arrivederci certainly does that with zero pretentiousness from the staff, and I also appreciated the casual elegance vibe the place had. Not to mention, I'm still dreaming of that dessert.",

It is an authentic Italian restaurant with many Italian staff members.  My husband had a dish with sausage and peppers and said it had great flavor and just enough spice.  I had pork loin in a gorgonzola cheese sauce with gnocchi.   The flavor was nice but it looked terribly bland; all white on the plate.  A little dusting on the dish of some color would be appropriate.  Our one criticism is that the water was served in a plastic tumbler.  Seriously?  This is a white table cloth restaurant with nice wine glasses and fairly high end menu.   The water also tasted awful like it had not been filtered.  All and all a good experience but the water glasses need to go and get a filter people.",

First when we made the reservation they told us they were opening at 4:30pm, when we arrived they were packed as they opened up a few hours earlier, wish we have known we would have came earlier.  Also when we made the reservation they said they would have a special Christmas menu in addition to their regular menu.  I asked if they would have Gluten free options on the menu in addition to the pasta they assured me they would.  Not the case.  When we arrived they were only serving the Christmas menu which did not have any GF options whatsoever.  None of the apps are GF.  I ordered a very boring salad.  Along with special order what was suppose to be GF penne with fresh veggie but what I received was GF pasta with cooked onions and no other fresh veggies.  They should not say they have GF options when in fact they do not, they only have penne pasta which is GF nothing else.  They should also not lie to customers telling them one thing when it was not the case, we would have went somewhere else.  Disappointed!!!",

I'm giving 2 stars because the lobster ravioli was great.  This place is very small which is ok we can deal with that. Our waitress was pushy and a bit rude. (Although I noticed her hugging several customers so maybe it was just us?) I can get over all of that. What bothered me the most was how dirty our silverware/glasses were. My wine glass had pieces of food dried on the inside. I mentioned it and our waitress brought another one. Our silverware looked like it only passed the rinse cycle in a dishwasher. And at the end she brought us complimentary shots and my shot glass had fresh lipstick stains on it. I was shocked. For the cost of this place the least they can do is make sure what you're eating off of is at least clean. It didn't help matters that when I asked for a different shot glass our waitress had an attitude.  We didn't feel very welcomed here and aside from good ravioli that's all there was to offer. Interesting experience though!",

My husband and I explained we booked on Open Table and they agreed to seat us. We were served our salad and entrees within 10 minutes of ordering (which was within 3 minutes of sitting down) and then were rushed out the door within 40 minutes. The chef brought our entrees and said sorry but my kitchen is closing so here's your food. If this is the situation, then Open Table should not list available seating at these times. The table of 12 people had just been served their entrees. There was absolutely NO need to rush us (only 2 people) out the door. We did nothing wrong but choose a dining time that was available on Open Table. When we were given the check, the table of 12 were not even finished with their entrees. We should have been allowed a more spaced out and relaxing meal. The food was mediocre and somewhat undercooked. The more we thought about how we were treated, the more disappointed we have become. We would not go back to Arrivederci. Perhaps they should not subscribe to Open Table or should cut off the reservation times earlier. This was unfair and unprofessional treatment for a dining establishment.",

Service was not the greatest, nor was the food. Seemed like the locals got a little more attention and service. The food was average at best, your typical Italian local restaurant.  The best part was the shot of limoncello they give you at the end of yoru meal.",

    "text": "Trying to keep it local, we went to Arrivederci for lunch today. Upon walking in the door, we were cheerily greeted by someone as they walked into the kitchen. It took a few minutes to get seated. It wasn't long at all and our adorable waiter, Kyle, stopped by the table. They had an eggplant special that sounded like it would be terrific if it were chicken instead of eggplant and a few other specials that sounded good - but we ended out ordering off the menu. We both got the Gnocchi - the hubby got it as mentioned in the menu with pesto sauce, I asked for mine with the pink vodka sauce. Both were quite good (although, I do think I preferred the pesto). The serving size was so big that I only ate half (and a few pieces of bread to smutz around in the vodka sauce). Kyle brought me a box. Which I managed to leave sitting on the table. :( damn it, I bet that would have re-heated nicely Anywho, place wasn't busy - probably 3-4 other tables eating lunch and two on the patio having beverages. It was clean and a nice atmosphere (sort of what you'd expect an Italian place to look like). Once we got sat, the service was super. We'll definitely go again. I hear good things about the pizza, perhaps we'll give that a try.... ?",

At my raised eyebrows he added- well the best after yours of course .  The service was courteous; but the restaurant was on the chilly side so we were cold.

We were a party of 6 and finally were about to get seated  at 810 at a table in central restaurant when another party of 6 pushed their way to the hostess and talked her into sitting them there. We were then offered a table literally  wedged between the front window and the bar next to the mob of people waiting to get in so we could eat with everyone's backsides in our faces. We declined and left.  Very disappointed.   Will not go back especially now knowing this is not a rare occurrence but sounds as if it is the norm for this restaurant.",

The bread arrived, which was four stars, served with olive oil containing garlic and petite diced tomatoes.  The Mozarella, tomato and basil salad was outstanding. Then came the disappointing entree: veal that was supposed to be served in a lemon, butter and caper sauce along side wild rice and roasted veggies.  The veal was wafer thin and literally swimming in an overpowering, greasy sauce; the veggies were ho-hum carrots, broccoli, etc. that were more steamed than roasted (and i suspect came from a bag); and the most unforgivable part was that the dish was served with acini di pepe, a bead-like pasta.  No wild rice was on the plate!  If you're going to make off-menu substitutions, at least have the good form to tell me that when I'm ordering.  Up to that point, I would have given Arrivederci five stars, but a one-star entree averages the experience to barely three.  Don't go here for the veal and certainly not the wild rice.",

While the ambiance is cute and works for a casual Italian restaurant, I was hoping for a great little find.  I was with two others and the salads were not good - the Caesar dressing tasted store-bought (and not a good store either).  I had the beef carpaccio and have to say it was the worst I have ever had - very tough around the edges and flavorless in the center of the beef.  They were very nice about exchanging it for a salad and didn't charge me for the dish.  I then had the eggplant appetizer and it was basically very thinly sliced eggplant with a mound of mozarella and some decent tomato sauce.  So, it actually tasted fine, but could have been better.  In addition, the prices were ridiculous for what you got.  If it was homemade pasta, I would understand.  But it clearly wasn't.  I'll keep looking for that great Italian restaurant that's not a chain, but stick with Maggiano's until I find it...",

The Eggplant Parm wrapped in spinach and 4 cheeses was amazing and so was the homemade pistachio ice cream with drizzled truffle chocoate.  Cute, cozy, authentic, reasonable pricing and exceptional portions...can't wait to go back!!!  A must try!!",

    "text": "A friend took me there today and we were the first to arrive for lunch. Our server was delightful and we were over the moon when he brought us fresh bread right out of the oven (almost burned our fingers) and pesto for dipping.  Pesto taste was well balanced and not overly oily.  The eggplant in our appetizer had great texture and the sauce was flavorful.  My linguini dish was delicious also I would just prefer the pasta to be a bit more al dente. My friend really enjoyed her gnocchi too. It was really hard for us to not finish everything on the plate .  We took the rest home and our wonderful server gave us extra bread to enjoy with the take-home portion. We will definitely come back!",

At 6:24 we finally got a soda. Wasn't even worth asking for wine with how long a soda took. She dropped the soda and ran didn't even ask if we wanted an app or were ready to order. I had a question about the menu I guess that question will go unanswered as well. While waiting 22 min for our app and yes I have timed everything out of pure irritation. We asked for more bread and they were out. Finally the long awaited homemade bread came out, we asked for another piece and the waitress told us no we have to give it to other people. Wow I have no words. The only positive was the food was great!!! The spaghetti was homemade and the white wine garlic sauce was perfect. Maybe they were busier then normal and she couldn't handle the volume I don't know. The other saving grace was the friendliest politest food runner/server assistant. Hire more of her and this place would excel beyond all expectations!",

Giovanni our waiter did the best he could but we think they simply overbooked and were slammed. Too bad they can't manage their customers better. The experience overshadowed the wonderful food.",

    "text": "Walked in the the space which was bathed in yellow light. Loud and noisy, but in a fun atmosphere. The service was terrific - 5 stars. We ordered calamari fritti with shrimp (gamberi) and the caprese as appetizers.  Our party enjoyed the calamari but was split about whether the amount of balsamic was sufficient.  We encountered a lot of difficulty with the amount of salt used on the entrees. Our entrees included orders of cioppino and festa del mare in both white and red sauces. One of the folks in the party ordered the rolled eggplant and said it was inedible due to the salt.  The red sauce was a little overboard with the salt, but edible. The white sauce was supposed to be a white clam sauce, but it misfired due to the salt and lack of clam flavor.  The good news about the seafood dishes is that the seafood itself was cooked perfectly. If they straighten out the salt error, the seafood dishes are definitely worth trying.  Now I do not know if the oversalting was normal. Maybe the chef had a bad day. I would go back and ask for a lower salt preparation.",

    "text": "Ate there twice. First time, excellent dinner with excellent service.   Second time...horrendous. Had a reservation for 7 pm. Seated at 7:45. At least 20 people waiting with reservations. Unacceptable.   After seating, our server took our drinks order. Wife and daughter had chianti. The worst EVER. Cough medicine tasted better.   After a very long wait, the server returned and took our order. My wife and I split the Caeser's salad, which was very good.   And then we waited. And waited. And waited. People at the next table who were seated after us were done with their dinner.   I confronted the hostess/manager and told her to just give us the bill and we would leave. She dissuaded us from doing so and told us drinks and dessert would be on them and she would get our server.   Our server then returned and said our entrees were served to the wrong table and they were re-cooking them new. Oh, and BTW what did we order?  Really?  She had no clue, which lent me to believe she never put the order in.   They brought another glass of bad chianti (on the house). 20 minutes later we were served our entree. And after we shared their chocolate tiramisu, which IS marvelous and delicious.   Okay, we felt the restaurant was just overwhelmed and overbooked. It can happen. Not happy, but it happens.   Fast forward a week later.  I find a credit card charge for $18 on Thursday. Now, we dined on Saturday and THAT charge was already posted to my card. We were never in the restaurant on Thursday!  Contacted my credit card company and they immediately credited my card.   Nevertheless, Arrividerci has zero clue how to control reservations. The waitress was horrendous. And they tried to scam me for an additional $18 on my credit card.   Bad enough we had lousy service all the way around. But they are also crooks.   Won't be returning!  Should have called the police.",

And what smell are they trying to cover...marinara, or mold?  Again, food and service were very good but that scent thing kills it for me.  Also they have not redecorated in 15 years, at least. Close for a weekend, purge, clean and start fresh. And change the lighting. It can be dim without being dingy.",

She acted as if we were annoying her and was very standoffish.  It made me think that we were at a diner in the middle of nowhere and we're dealing with a burnt out employee.  Now the food.. I ordered the chicken parmigiana.  The sauce was very watery and caused the chicken to be soggy and have the texture of boiled chicken.  The sauce tasted and had the consistency like a over salted tomato juice. I have had better jarred sauce. I only ate it because I was starving because I waited 30 for my food. My wife ordered the chicken and gnocchi. The sauce was a brown thick and salty.  The pieces that didn't have sauce on them were very good.  The gnocchi was sad looking and very large almost like a small scallop.  It was covered in the brown goo that was supposed to be sauce. They were inedible.   The waitress ignored us completely during our meal and had to wave down another wAiter to fill our drinks. Way over priced for the quality of food. It seems like they forgot why they opened a restaurant and were trying to make as much money as they can before they close the doors.   I would pass..",

    "text": "After hearing good things, we tried this restaurant for the first time, and are very glad we did! Bottom line: the food and service is excellent, but be prepared to wait if you visit on the weekends EVEN WITH A RESERVATION. The restaurant is small. So small, that I'm surprised that they take reservations at all, since many small establishments don't. Our original reservation was on a Saturday at 7pm. On Saturday morning I happened to check OpenTable and noticed that both the \"6:00pm\" and \"6:30pm\" slots were sold out. Because I had read through all the reviews, I knew this meant we would probably be stuck waiting a while when we checked in at 7:00pm. Because we had a show to get to after dinner, and I didn't want to risk a rushed meal, I changed our reservation to 6:15 and I am SO HAPPY I did! When we arrived at 6:15 and place was packed and we were seated in the LAST open table. Minutes later, as I predicted, people started showing up for their 6:30 \"reservations\" and there was no available tables. As we were seated very near the host stand, the rest of our meal was spent listening to some very angry people who had to wait. Note: there is a bar in the reception area to make the wait a bit more bearable. Luckily, the food and service were so good that this didn't put a damper on our evening. As other reviewers have mentioned, most of the tables are VERY close together, and as such, the atmosphere is VERY LOUD, so if that bothers you, I would avoid this restaurant altogether. We had the Caprese Rustica, Lobster Ravioli, Chicken with gnocchi in Gorgonzola sauce, and the Chocomisu (dessert), and enjoyed every last bite! Overall, I would recommend this restaurant as the food and service are top-notch. If you don't want to risk a wait wait, it's better to visit during lunch, or before 6:30pm on the weekends. If you don't like lively restaurant atmospheres (noise) or sitting too close to the tables next to you, this is not the best place for you.",

When we came in, the hostess asked if we had reservations - we didn't, but they had us seated in no time. We got seated and It was loud! Lots of happy folks talking and eating. That's a good sign!  After a brief wait, they brought out delicious bread and pesto. It was yummy!  For dinner, I had the meat and cheese lasagna. It was a treat. It had a somewhat of a light texture and was just delicious. The lady ordered rigatoni ala vodka with shrimp. I was jealous at first just by looking at it, but she was nice enough to trade halfway through. Lucky me - that was delicious as well!  We finished off with the cheesecake. It wasn't the best I ever had, but it was good.  So that was my experience.  I hope this place is here forever, because I'd like to make it back a few times.",

It seemed that the main complaint was reservations not being honored in a timely fashion.  I hope this is not the case, as we have always enjoyed our evenings here.

We had reservations and the waiter that greeted us gave us the option of a couple tables - we selected one, and he said no, that was for four people (they why was that an option???) I didn't care to sit at the table for two next to a party of 8 + a baby, so he sat us at another table for four (so if this table for four is OK, why not the other one??)  I was sooo looking forward to that nice, warm fresh herby bread roll...it came, but not so fresh or warm. meh. Not being overly famished, I ordered the cheese ravioli with arrabbiata (spicy) sauce. Flavorful, yes, but not spicy as described. The homemade ravioli were large and flavorful, though. The veal carciofi with lemon caper sauce was good, but not great - the sauce was not lemony at all; the veal was cooked to tender, but again, meh.(we had gone to Nick's a couple of weeks ago and had this dish & it was awesome)   The place was busy - which I'm always happy to see in this economy. We have seen our waiter when we've been there on previous visits - he's not new to a busy night. He wasn't over friendly but did answer our questions, took our order, brought our drinks then went missing. Until of course, it was time to bring the bill.  If this had been our first visit, it would be our last. Still, it may be a while before we return - there are many more locally-owned Italian restaurants that will be all to happy for the business.",

    "text": "Visited today for lunch and was very pleasantly surprised by both the character of the restaurant and the quality of the food and service!   I don't usually do Italian places for lunch, but this place came highly recommended by a colleague. We arrived shortly after they opened for lunch and got table in the center of the restaurant, which was great. They have wine bottles everywhere in here, racked by the entrance, the bar, even in some of the sections of the overhang in the dining areas, which is just plain cool. The hand drawn and painted artwork on the wall and the traditional Italian vibe in this place is really nice, one of those rare experiences where you actually feel like you've been somewhere, not just inside a restaurant, if you know what I mean. It was large enough to bring a good crowd, but still felt intimate enough that it would be great for a quiet dinner date.   We dined off the lunch menu and, I must say, the bread they offer while you ponder the menu is simply outstanding. It came with a pesto and tomato based oil that was incredibly good and all of us had seconds, thirds and I think even fourths of these things!  As for the food itself, one word: amazing. I had their signature ravioli dish and it was absolutely mouthwatering. I could not get enough and, were there not the risk of looking like a complete pig in front of my colleagues, I probably would have ordered seconds. The sauce was out of this world good and the ravioli were cooked to perfection. I am definitely coming back to have this again, even if I have to go alone, it's that good.   The service was top notch; friendly, timely and helpful with menu questions, so no complaints there. In so far as a restaurant can make the perfect first impression on a new customer, I think this place has it down pat. I am definitely going back, and I'm definitely taking some folks with me to bring them some more business and to experience their awesome ravioli. What more can I say? I'm addicted and have to go back for more.",

I picked my backup dish...   I asked the server about the lobster ravioli and she said that is on dinner's special but since they have them ready, they can serve during lunch too!  I started my lunch with caprese salad, which I split with my friend.  They were kind enough to separate the plate after I told her I wanted to split the salad.  I enjoyed the fresh taste of mozzarella cheese.  I also liked the pesto served with bread.  Bread was freshly baked and went really well with homemade pesto sauce.  I never though of using pesto for bread, but they went well together.  Lobster Ravioli.... pasta was very good and enjoyed generous portion of lobster. Unfortunately sauce was a bit salty for my liking.  I still ate all of them as pasta tasted good, so I asked for the second bread and ate the sauce separately with my bread.  Excellent service. We both had bags with us, and the server brought extra chairs for our bags next to our table.  When we ordered espresso, she brought one at a time as she wanted to serve the coffee hot.  I saw chocomisu on the desert menu, I would like to come back to order chocomisu (their menu said only one in the US to serve chocomisu, to the best of their knowledge).",

They are a well oiled machine.   We ordered a bottle of their Chianti, hubs got the Lobster Ravioli and I got the Seafood Fra Diavolo. Once we ordered, both of us received a puffy freshly made roll to dip in their pesto sauce. Unfortunately, I felt the pesto sauce was lacking of flavor. But the bread in itself was so tasty, I ate it without complaint :)   Hubs' Lobster Ravioli was very good with two bite sized pieces of lobster tail in the middle of the plate.  However, I think he wasn't filled after eating his whole meal since the dish only comes with approx. 6 or 5 raviolis. It was a bit light for him...  My Diablo was stupid good. I loved the level of spiciness and they were not stingy with the scallops and the shrimp either. I must say, between the Lobster Ravioli and the Shrimp and Scallop Fra diavolo, I'd the Diavolo anytime.   We both received a shot of Limoncello at the end of our meal which was a nice touch.  Well done Arrivederci. We will be back.",

I find the dining room to be very cozy.  I am a fan because I feel that Arrivederci is one of the best and most underrated of its kind in Scottsdale. This is not the first time that Giovanni was our waiter and he is absolutely fantastic.   I started the meal with the smoked salmon appetizer with arugula and marinated artichoke salad which was wonderful. My entree was the penne with mozzarella, eggplant and shrimp. My friend had the linguini with olive oil and mussels and clams. Both entrees were great and the pasta were perfectly al  dente.  For the dessert finale, we had a lovely Illy espresso and the chocamisu which is Arrivederci's take on the classic tiramisu which was decadent but not too rich! I had the chocolate truffle which is a delicious concoction of chocolate and hazelnut ice creams. Both presentation of the desserts were quite well done!  All in all a wonderful lunch! Thank you Arrivederci and especially Giovanni!",

    "text": "My wife and I were quite excited about trying this place after reading all the reviews. \"Best Italian I've had in 16 years\" was the one that stood out to me. After experiencing this place first hand, I can tell you, you'll have a better meal at Olive Garden or Maggiano's and it'll be more memorable.   First off, the server we had was absolutely brutal. I don't know if she was just having a bad day or what, but she was the most depressing person I've ever had serve me in my entire life. Usually when I see someone like this, I try to be extra nice and go above and beyond to be friendly, this lady wasn't having any of it. Completely disinterested in my wife and I having a great experience and gave off a \"woe is me\" attitude.   Second, my wife ordered a decently expensive glass of red wine. She gets her glass and there are still remnants of women's lipstick stains on the rim of the glass. Pretty gross. When my wife politely asked the server for a new glass, we might as well have killed her first-born son. She didn't seem to care or give any sort of reaction. Almost like it happens often. Concerning...  Third, with the food, I've never been more disappointed in my life. The Caesar salad tasted like the bagged salads you buy at Safeway. Ok, a salad is a salad, I was willing to look past it and was anxious for the main course. I ordered meatball lasagna and my wife ordered fettuccine alfredo. Both were so poorly prepared that we both didn't finish our meals. At Maggiano's down the street the food is SIGNIFICANTLY better and the price is significantly lower.   Overall, one of the worst experiences I've had in Scottsdale. The only good thing about the experience was the hostess. She was friendly and professional and \"hoped I enjoyed my food\".   Avoid this place. Save your money and go to Maggiano's right down the street for a better meal and price.",

The service was excellent too! People that have complained about the service must have come on a very bad night or the restaurant read the reviews and made some quick changes. I seriously couldn't have asked for more efficient service. The person binging the bread and waters almost had them both on the table before we sat down. We were asked several times throughout the meal if we wanted additional bread. Most restaurants make you beg for bread. We loved the bread and pesto, but declined because we had ordered appetizers and a salad, there just wouldn't have been room.   All in all the 5 stars are for a nice dining experience, the meal seemed authentic, I thought the bread, pesto, calamari, Lobster Ravioli and my cappuccino were absolutely filling and worth the price. My fiance thought his pasta dish \"needed something\", but this is my review and I wasn't eating his food.",

We walked across the parking lot to Arrivederci expecting to receive bad news and were pleasantly surprised by their understanding and warm accommodation.  They moved several tables and made room for our group - which was amazing.  We are Italian and foodies and were as delighted with the food as we were the service.  The pasta, Bronzino, veal and eggplant dishes were extraordinary - especially on a crowded Friday during \"snowbird season\". The restaurant manager visited with us and made sure we enjoyed the experience.  The complementary limoncello at the end was a nice touch. This is how customer loyalty is created and it worked!  All of the couples in our group will be returning to Arrivederci.  Thank you.",

After the long wait, our meals were served and the waiter never came back to the table for the rest of the night. Some of us liked our meals and others did not. The chicken parmigiana was just a slab of chicken without breading topped with a slice of cheese.  Did the chef just get lazy?  It was tasteless and unappetizing.   When the check came (over $400.00) the tip of over 20 percent was added to the total after tax. Also they charged us twice for a meal that cost $29. They tried to rip us off and they were unpleasant when we asked them to correct the mistake.  We sat there for another 20 minutes while they recalculated the check. Go eat somewhere else!  There are plenty of better Italian restaurants.",

It's the quintessential red sauce palace where pasta is overcooked, dishes are over-salted, and menu specials are frustratingly repetitive. The market for this type of restaurant is diminishing, as evidenced by the predominance of older seniors present over three visits I made with my chef girlfriend since April. There isn't much here for younger, hipper diners whose palates have become more sophisticated. That said, the service provided by the wait staff is attentive and courteous, and the on-the-house limoncello digestifs are thoughtful.",

Three tips: the sea bass is to die for; they are very generous with salad dressing so if you aren't a dressing person ask for light or get it on the side; and the lemoncello is house made...don't skip it.   The wait staff is incredible, (feel like family to me now) and have been there forever, which means they simply cannot give bad service. Avoid Mother's and Valentine's; (get an imagination...really? A meal out? Cook for and wait on her yourself!); and the service will never be a problem. Walk in, get a table, and enjoy a relaxing perfect evening of Italian bliss.",

    "text": "I must have passed this place a thousand times and admired the cool sports cars outside of it.  Finally decided to try it for lunch.  There were two couples there who were having an early lunch just like us.  The place was nicely decorated and had white tablecloths on every table.  Very nice.  We were served basil pesto in a deep, green, extra-virgin olive oil that was a complement to the bread we were served.  The pesto dip was really delicious although I thought it needed a few grains of salt to balance it out.  The bread roll was puffy and crunchy on the outside with a nice texture inside.  I like bread with holes and this one had them.  We ordered chicken parm  and hubby had a chicken cutlet with a slice of eggplant on it.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and delicious. Each came with penne with a tasty tomato sauce.  The penne were perfectly cooked al dente.  The sauce was really good-- as I like it not too sweet and not too acidic.  Nicely balanced sauce, almost NY style.  We didn't have dessert but viewed the dessert menu for future reference.  I saw that they have a ricotta/mascarpone cheese cake on the menu that I will have next time around .   What surprised me was that the two lunches were $12.95 each and the total bill was totaled as $42 and change.  What?  That is quite a math error(?) --almost $16 over.  Usually errors are a dollar here or there but not $16.  The waitress could not explain the error but corrected the bill using a calculator.  We did not under tip her as a result of this and this will not deter us from enjoying their delicious food once again.  We prefer to believe that it was an accidental error.",

    "text": "What a mistake! We had heard that this was a good neighborhood Italian restaurant so we tried it on Valentine's Day. Arrived 5 minutes prior to our 8pm reservation and waited outside in a line for 25 minutes. The hostess refused to check guests in, instead making them wait until you were allowed to wait in their tiny bar and lined up in order of the next party. After seated for 15 minutes I asked the hostess to send our server as no one including the water and bread server had stopped by. The waiter promptly came, took our order, brought drinks but still no water or bread. Five minutes later I was able to flag that server and get water, bread and pesto. Our salads came out 15 minutes later and then the wait intensified. The 4-top next to us warned us they had bee there 2 hours and still didn't have their meals. They finally told their server to cancel their orders which he acknowledged. As he stepped away, their food arrived only to be cold. Then the server brought their checks to which they refused to pay. His response, \"Sorry but these things happen\". Miraculously our meals appeared 25 minutes after our salads and 2 minutes prior to our planned departure. The food was warm at best but there wasn't anyway that we were going to send it back and stay overnight especially since they had one food runner. After finishing the mediocre eggplant rollup and chicken parm, we asked for the check. 15 minutes later it appeared and another 10 minutes was required to process the wrong check! So over two hours spent in a thoroughly overwhelmed restaurant with many guests experiencing the same lack of hospitality. No one received a table visit, apology or acknowledgment despite the owners chatting at the front for 20 minutes after the rush passed. Obviously they overbooked the restaurant and never saw fit to accommodate their guests by being up front, apologizing or even comping a drink or dessert. Instead they avoided their guests and subjected their staff to a hellish experience. just consider me one and done.",

Well, looks are deceiving.     I decided to give them a try when I saw a deal on Groupon.  I figured if it wasn't good, at least I wouldn't mind at half price.  To make a long story short, I was pleasantly surprised.  Sure, it's not perfect, but take it for what it is.   If you are looking for upscale, trendy, classy, fancy, romantic, elegant, overpriced, top notch, 5 star, then this is not the place for you.  But for the price, the place is more than satisfactory.    Atmosphere is minimal, some call it tacky, but who cares, I don't go there for the atmosphere.  It has, however, become one of my favorite, neighborhood standbys and that's exactly what it's good for.    Prices are extremely reasonable and wait staff is very pleasant and welcoming.  Out of the 5 or 6 times I have been there, 4 dishes or so were above average and maybe 2 were average.  Nothing has ever been bad or even close to bad.   It's a small, homey, casual, corner spot that's a great, little find   Would I drive 20 miles to eat there, probably not?  Would I return?  Yes, again and again!",

    "text": "Eduardo and his team were superb.  We held a surprise 50th birthday party for my sister and my cousin, Heather was an amazing hostess.  She knew this was Mimi's favorite place in Scottsdale and I had never eaten there before. Service was amazing!  The food was just as awesome. I can hardly wait to have the leftovers--generous servings and the manager oversaw the party of 7 like it was a presidential event. Truly heartwarming to be welcomed and have such a special memory. They learned Heather had a recent birthday (50!) herself and offered up a Tiamisu on the house with a second song.  Did I mention they didn't skip a beat when two little boys in a clandestine way brought them a brownie cake from home and asked them to light 50 candles the boys put in themselves (with a little supervision).  It was 13x9 aflame--all of them; that's quite a feat!  We will come back again, and again and....you get the idea.  Don't miss the old world gem where the manager really does speak Italian and believe in making your family feel like royalty!",

    "text": "Not a great restaurant but good enough. We wanted Italian food and remembered a place we hadn't been to for a few years. It is well organized. A minute after we were seated ice water and bread were served. The bread had the look and feel of a small Rhodes bread loaf if the product still exists. It was very white and quite substantial. The dipping sauce was not memorable: olive oil (I think) and some vinegar (I think) and some mystery herbs. Everything was better from there.  We skipped appetizers, salad and soup. The salads looked good. My wife loved the gnocchi, my chicken, sausage and noodles were great. One friend loved the ravioli and the other the chicken breast. Food prices were fair. Desserts made up for other food prices: spumoni for $7.50 seems high and same for cheesecake. The wine was also expensive  $7 for house merlot is expensive though $7.50 for a glass of Sangiovese not so bad. Service was good until it got busy.  We got limoncello with the bill which always helps.  We wondered how we had forgotten this excellent restaurant. We will be back soon.",

The food was good, the wine was good and the service was excellent.  The owner and staff went well beyond what would normally be expected.  When we couldn't get a cab or car to come pick us up and take us back to our hotel, they drove us back.  Amazing!!  They were so lovely and we thoroughly enjoyed ending our evening with stories of their families and their passion for Italian cuisine.  No wonder their restaurant is a success!!",

The restaurant decor is old, tired and bleak.  The chairs are some of the most uncomfortable I have sat in.  The wine prices were fair.  We received our entrees within five minutes of ordering.  Obviously the food is ready to go and quickly heated in a microwave.  My husband had an appetizer, which was very small and he said that it was fair.  Our son had the Fusilli Bolognese which he said was spicy but good.  I had the cannelloni.  The lukewarm pasta was gummy and dry which indicates it was sitting out too long.  The filling and sauce were terrible.  I could barely eat one of the three tubes.  Overall, it was a disappointing meal.  Service was very inconsistent and we had to ask for everything. We had three issues here that never should have happened in a restaurant like this:   server never asked how our meals were, empty plates were not removed in a timely fashion and the server reached his arm across the table in front of me to pick up the bill after I had signed the credit card receipt and stood there checking out what the amount of the tip was.  That rudeness really did it for us.",

Although my food is great, the wait staff is a little pushy (may be the Italian in them).  No expression on there faces or warm smiles.  I've been here only a handful of times but crave there eggplant quite often.  It is a very intimate setting and a great date night!  I remember once asking for more bread with our meal and the bread took almost 20 minutes, but it did taste like it came out of the oven.  The portions are very generous and I always have left overs.  I would recommend this place for good Italian food but if your wanting a warm friendly wait staff I would check out the olive garden, where you are family!",

This dish was exactly as I expected it to be, and I loved it.  They refilled our waters many times, and they had quite a number of staff available.  I do agree with other reviews in that the tables are very close and it is noisy. Very difficult to be intimate.

We ordered a salad with vinaigrette dressing, it came out with a creamy dressing and the waitress says .. \"that's not what I had written down\" and walked away.

We were brought rolls that appear to be homemade and taste to be too.  They come with a bowl of pesto that is fantastic!  I had the Canneloni with beef filling in a red cream sauce and my husband had the Gnocci  We asked if we could have the gnocci with meatballs and red sauce instead of the menu choices of chicken, shrimp or salmon.  We think the meatballs and red sauce should be added to the menu as a selection.  It was superb!  Fresh and garlicky.  My canneloni were very rich and the melty, crusty cheese on top really made the dish.  We did not get salads prior to our meal nor dessert afterwards.  Our orders were plentiful.  We will be back!",

Lemon drop martini.... kinda bitter.. they use their homemade lemonciello or however you spell that.  Had very good service and that's a big thing to me.

My aunt had a fish special with black olives and capers - she said fish was done perfect but the dish was a bit salty (olives and capers might be why).

The food was very good.  Second visit was a weekend dinner and the place was packed.  Three of us this time and we got an awkward table straddling the threshold between the main dining hall and the winterized patio.  There was a large, loud group in the small patio type room behind us ruining the atmosphere.

    "text": "Wrapping up our stay in Phoenix, the manfriend and I were hoping for a pretty decent meal here, after the previous night's amazing dining at Quiessence.  What a let down, even though we got a good laugh out of the Ferrari parked out front (how many plates of pasta sold?!)  I grew up in with a Sicilian family and spent years on the East Coast, eating literally hundreds of meals in restaurants all throughout New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  My opinion is that I have tasted authentic American-Italian food from the gamut of my grandfather's bolognese sauce (to die for) to off the Jersey turnpike dive Italian joints (to die from).  I appreciate a good dive joint with homey Italo-US grub.  This ain't it.  + 1 Star - Decor.  I love the kitchy (ok, downright tacky) walls painted with the Italo-city flair.  It's just the perfect hideous companion to the checkered table clothes and low grade china/glasses.  It works for me. + 1 Star - Waiters.  I love grumpy Italian waiters! Their presence usually means that there will be some good food coming. - 1 Star - Bread.  What is with the hideous squishy white rolls?  At least they were warm and came with some pesto dipping sauce.  But they were more like sandwich rolls and less like dinner bread. - 1 Star - Pasta.  Why is the pasta cooked to paste?  Is it because we were the only diners in the place without gray hair, maybe they can't chew the al dente anymore?  Squishy noodles that became paste in my man's dish, and blubbery tubes that couldn't be forked (I had to spoon them!) in mine. - 1 Star - Sauce.  I had vodka sauce.  He had al fredo with mushrooms.  Not a good comment when he says: \"It tastes like beef stroganoff without the beef\".  My vodka sauce was not bad, but nothing I would think about twice. - 1 Star - Grated Cheese.  Not fresh grated.  Likely bought in bulk - was actually \"sprinkled\" over my food (by request) with large sticky-glumps of it bouncing off the edges of my plate.  Had zero flavor - just a mild saltiness.  Obviously cheap quality. - 1 Star - Bus person.  Hey lady!  Why would you come and ask my date if he wants a box for his pasta leftovers (ugh! no thanks!) while I am still SPOONING food into my gullet?  There are plenty of other empty tables, so why rush us?  Oh, and you don't have to come by twice and ask it.  Get us some more grainy Phoenix tap water, why dontcha? - 1 Star - Price.  It felt overpriced to me to pay $15 for his plate of mediocre pasta with no protein (chicken, salmon, meat).  And just about that for mine.  Add one beer (I had water) and we are hovering around $40 with tax/tip.  Silly.  I really would like to give these guys below a 2 but they weren't quite nasty enough to rate a 1.  I don't know what all these people who are rating this place 4 and even 5 stars are thinking.  Maybe they are comparing it to Olive Garden (I mentioned that place to my man and he said he thought the OG food was better than here!) or Macaroni Grill? This is a place for people who have mediocre taste buds and little experience with innovative dining.   For me, I won't bother coming again and neither should you.",

    "text": "Hello Fellow Travelers, My husband and I had the great pleasure of trying Ristorante Arrivederci in Scottsdale last evening.  Having lived here in Arizona for about 6 years, we always drove by this restaurant yet never ventured in.  I guess better late than never, as our taste buds were delightfully satisfied!  Their mission boasts healthy but tasty food, casual elegance and impeccable service.  Ristorante Arriverderci keeps its promise to all three.  This restaurant's roots come from a native Master Italian chef, Franco, who partnered to bring their special \"Nouvelle Italian Cuisine\" to:  La Jolla, California, Scottsdale and Ahwatukee, Arizona, and finally Houston, Texas.  A:  Upon entering this establishment, you are taken to a most welcoming atmosphere.  To the left hand side, there is a small cozy bar area.  The hostess awaits you with a smile and you see a most cozy dining area, complete with several sections of intimate areas to dine.  The hostess seated us towards the back dining area, where it can be a little warmer.  They are quick though to adjust the air conditioning, to make sure all are comfortable.  The walls have quotes in Italian, along with decor that takes you away to a feeling of dining in a cozy restaurant off the streets in Rome.  We were promptly given water at our table, as well as warm fresh bread with pesto dipping sauce.  A nice touch with the fresh roll of bread served from the basket of a server!  T:  Their menu includes a variety of appetizers to delight, as well as salads, hearty pasta meals, secondary entrees, and their special \"Treasure of the Chef\" entrees.  Prices for their pastas and entrees vary from 11.00 to 19.95.  Their portions are large, so you are certainly receiving every cent worth you pay.  I ordered the Campagnola salad and Rigatoni Emiliani with meatballs for my main course.  The salad was crisp and refreshing, along with a generous portion of balsamic vinaigrette.  The Rigatoni Emiliani with meatballs will satisfy any pasta and meatball craving!  A more than ample serving of large rigatoni pasta, mixed in with a generous serving of their tomato sauce and homemade meatballs makes for pasta dish deliciousness.  Their seasonings within the dish bring the a taste that no other that I have tasted in the valley.  About 4-5 meatballs are included, so the carnivore in you is also satisfied.  This dish makes for an extremely filling meal.  They also have dessert if you still have room left over from your meal!  :)  Next time, will have to save some room to sample their dessert which I am certain is quite unforgettable as well. Upon closing out our bill, we received a shot of limoncello to help with digestion.  An extremely nice touch to close out our meal.   E:  Our overall experience was one not to be forgotten.  Even a nice touch with our waitress' tie embroidered with her initial.  :) I wish we would have ventured into this establishment all the sooner.  I guess better late than never, and will certainly make up for lost time!  I will never want to say arrivederci to this restaurant!  I will say hello many a time in my dining future.  Your Honored Guide, --Christina",

    "text": "\"Why Our Dream Dinner Turned Into A Nightmare,\" or \"How The Veal Would Have Made A Better Shoe Than Meal.\"   It was a special occasion with 3 generations dining together. We sat down on a Saturday Evening at 6:30 and listened to the wait person describe the specials and one of the more popular eggplant dishes. She put in our appetizer order and returned for dinner orders. Two of us asked for the eggplant dish and to our surprise they were sold out, at 6:45 on a Saturday night???  Strike one.   The most senior members of our party ordered the veal and found it less than tender. Not ones to complain they toughedp  it out. If you want to give your dental implants a good workout, order the veal.  Highly recommended. Strike two.   One of the simplest dinner orders from the vegetarian in our party was pasta and vegetables sans zucchini. When the dish arrived, you guessed it, zucchini was part of the mix. We brought it to the attention of the wait person, and in addition  to being visibly annoyed, she said it will take too long to re-do.  So we settled for pasta and sauce, which was comped. Even so, Strike Three.   I know others rave about the food, the atmosphere, the overall positive experience of dining here. That's what made our evening that much more disappointing. With so many other great Italians eateries in the area, we will be moving on to dine at one of them next time.",

Before we ordered, she brought hot, crusty rolls to the table with pesto dipping sauce. That was just amazing to stir up our appetites!   We had a crisp, extra cool Caesar salad for starters that was just perfect. We followed that with the Melanzana Sorrentina appetizer, which is grilled eggplant with mozzarella and a delicate tomato sauce. Our entree was a fantastic veal scallopini with artichoke hearts and capers in another sublime sauce.   Arrivederci in North Scottsdale is a gem! We recommend it highly for lunch or dinner.

    "text": "It was windy out, which was as good an excuse as any not to cook, so I went through my Groupons looking for a place to go. We settled on Arrivederci for Sunday night's dinner. This Scottsdale restaurant isn't very large (although I noticed they did have additional seating on the other side of some sliding doors.) We were greeted warmly and seated immediately. This place is nicely decorated with wall murals and the tables are set far enough apart so you can hear one another. It had a really warm and comfortable feel. It appears there are a lot of regulars who everyone seems to know. Our waitress brought menus and some really delicious rolls that were perfect with the accompanying pesto dipping sauce. Replenishments were offered, even after I decided another one would interfere with my meal.  The wine list is reasonably priced. We started off sharing a plate of perfectly fried calamari--some rings and some little squiddies with a few large shrimp thrown in for good measure. It was not greasy and the marinara sauce we dipped it in was very good. My husband ordered salmon that came over spinach with a light, lemony sauce. I ordered the Melenzana Eggplant, the restaurant's version of Eggplant Parmesan. This dish evoked many fond memories. The eggplant was rolled up slices that were stuffed with spinach and multiple cheeses. The rolls rested in a cheesy tomato sauce and pasta was served alongside. This was similar to something my grandmother made when I was a kid, although she put some meat in her rolls. Everyone loved it until I told my brothers it was eggplant, not zucchini. Arriverderci's version was absolutely decadent and while I am usually a traditionalist, I wouldn't want to eat it any other way again. Service was excellent and other staff  besides our waitress occasionally checked on us. My dinner was so filling I could not finish it and our server boxed it up for me. My husband, on the other hand, spotted someone else's dessert and felt the need to order the Choccomissou. I had intended to eat just one bit, but this layered extravaganza was so light and so good, I couldn't help myself. The food was delicious, the prices reasonable and service was spot on.  I went to bed that night full and happy, wondering how long it would take before the Arriverderci staff called me by name. We will definitely be back again. Incidentally, that last eggplant roll made a fabulous breakfast!",

I had the pollo gordon bleu upon request and it was fabulous.

But then it got even better. I ordered the veal, which had lots of my faves... Capers, lemons, & olive oil. My friend loved her lasagna. We ordered a bottle of wine and we just chilled. It was great! I would like to also highlight the lovely people that took care of us. It takes a village. For water it was one attendant, then our waitress, and then out of the blue this chef-looking lady came out of nowhere to serve the wine and bread. She said she made the pasta and bread right on site. No wonder the fresh taste. I swear that accent was Italian. I didn't ask... But almost sure, and that's cool. Italian food made by Italians... This is definitely not Olive Garden. Our waitress was simply the best. She made the experience a breeze. She was attentive, kind, ready to answer questions and assist without much fuzz. I recommend this place to anyone seeking for authentic Italian... Period!",

The restaurant was full but the new hostess found us a nice table for two. Eddie, who is the best in the business, made sure we had our drinks and salad order taken because the kitchen was busy. The Mediterranean Salad was outstanding and our entrees were timed perfectly. The home made pasta with bolognese was a five out of five. The Lasagna special was a nice treat as it's not on the menu all the time. Very filling and delicious! The finale was a new desert, Italian cheesecake, and was a nice twist. Always a great meal in a comfortable setting with great service.",

Most of the the waitstaff are Italian and it makes you feel like you are getting a real Italian experience.  They always have nightly specials that the waiter can tell you about.  I had the fish special this time as my main course and it was delicious. We shared the eggplant dish as an appetizer and I could have easily eaten the entire thing it was so delicious.  I tend to special order menu items a lot and they are excellent about always accommodating my special requests. Without hesitation they changed out my pasta sauce and cooked my fish without butter. A friend at the table got the same dish prepared the \"normal\" way and visually you could see they actually accommodated my request of no butter and didn't just say they did or use less.  The rolls they serve with dinner are also delicious.  It happened to be pouring the night we were there and none of us had umbrellas. The staff walked us individually to our cars so we did not get wet. I will definitely be back again.  My only negative is that they close early (week nights particularly) so if you like to stay out past 9/9:30 at dinner you should try here on a night you want to be home earlier.",

Penne vodka with salmon was equally tasteless and seemed like it came from a can and then for a few days.  The bread were store bought roles served with pesto sauce with little flavor mixed in with poor tasting olive oil.  There are some fantastic Italian restaurants in town.  This one was terrible and I will never go to again.",

    "text": "I ended up here on my birthday and the bartender made a stellar impression on the phone. We called around 6-7 on a Saturday night and he said he would have a table waiting.  I was thrilled to come in, and it was a nice atmosphere. They do well with the space they have. I was a little sad by the menu because they vegetarian options were limited.  I ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo with mushrooms. Typically I adore this dish, I can make it from scratch so I'm a bit picky about it. It came out with onions which was not on the menu. I despise onions with a passion. I had to wait for the waitress to come back so I could tell her, that was a good 5 minutes. When told she rushed off without a word, although I was still trying to ask her a question. It was really abrupt. She was generally nice most of the visit but I was still thrown off by the weird behavior. Apparently it was not supposed to come with onions anyway. The other gripe I have is that the sauce seemed watery and runny instead of the thick creamy sauce alfredo typically would be. The wine was very good, but again with the waitress I attempted to ask her about the wines and she did not seem at all knowledgeable while she dodged my questions. I'm not sure if we would make a return visit. Service and the confusing food issues just aren't up to par with surrounding places. My friends enjoyed their food though although were also baffled by our waitress.",

My father and and husband are addicted to the veal gorgonzola and ordered it the other night as usual. They raved about the tenderness of the meat and the richness of the cheese sauce. Unlike these gentlemen, I order something different every time we go. This time is was the gnocci with shrimp and argula---yum! The potato dumplings were sleek, plump, and velvety, peppered with plenty of shrimp in the sauce. I find the freshness of their seafood and the pastas pretty amazing.   Of course the service tops it all off. Our lovely \"mustached\" waiter, who had obviously been doing his job well for many years, kept things humming and organized. We received a very warm greeting at the door as well to start things off on the right note as well. We love this place!",

Not what I would do, but on to the food:   The rolls with pesto to start were fantastic. Good thing they only gave us one roll apiece or we'd have filled up on those. We split an arugula salad, which had a great vinaigrette dressing.   For dinner,  I had the linguini vogole-shrimp, clams, mussels and calamari with the perfect amount of red sauce and expertly cooked noodles. My other half had the carne cannelloni, which was super rich, but SO tasty! I had more than one bite and was really impressed.   We had no room to do dessert, but we did clean our dinner plates.   Bottom line- super good food, but I can't afford it all the time. Thanks for the experience groupon!",

    "text": "Arrivederci, a southern Italian enclave in the midst of a strip mall in the desert, can boast the rare designation of a dining choice that was not a compromise candidate between members of my family. Granted, I might have just been weak from the travel, but I was enthusiastic to satiate a hunger difficult to address in my homeland.  I was not disappointed with what we found. An owner who greets patrons with \"buena sera!\" in a thoroughly non-corporate, warm, mood-lit setting is always a good sign. Many patrons who respond back in Italian and conduct themselves like they're at their second home are an even better sign, even if the restaurant was a bit empty.  The True test, of course, is the food. No amount of show or neighborhood family feel could compensate for a massive kitchen deficiency. Fortunately, it wasn't required:  - Bread: Uninteresting... except I could drink the accompanying pesto and oil mix. - Minestrone (~$5): The lowlight. A case of nothing ventured, nothing gained. Skip it. - Gnocchi in pink vodka sauce with salmon (~$19): Let's just say I was highly looking forward to the leftovers as two separate snacks.  - \"Choco\"misu (~$7): Much hullabaloo is made about the addition of the ingredient, but it really just came off as above average tiramisu. - Cannoli (~$5): Always ridiculously unhealthy, but here it's made properly with ricotta and the texture is spot on enough to justify it.  Arrivederci is an excellent \"corner\" restaurant in a land lacking a bit in both deviance and corners. More importantly, it clearly passes the \"would survive in NJ as-is\" test. There is nothing left to say.",

Then after 50 minutes we were told that a party who had a reservation after us was going to get a table because they had a bigger number guests. we were just livid. We demanded to speak to the owner/manager but was told he was in the kitchen preparing food.  finally after 90 minutes we sat down, and the waiter was rushing us and not very attentive. We asked again to speak to the owner/manager and was told he left the building because he did not want to face angry customers. This place is TERRIBLE.   The food was so-so.

The sauce was excellent. The bread was fresh, warm and just the right amount of crisp. Caesar salad was great and we split that. You get pesto in oil along with butter if you wish for the bread.

I had the eggplant parmigiana, which was presented rolled and filled with spinach and cheese. I have never had it prepared that way and found it to be even more delicious then the traditional preparation.   After dinner we received a small glass of limoncello each while deciding on dessert. I was pleasantly surprised at the serving size of the pistachio truffle dessert and enjoyed every last bite.    We would love to go back again and try more of the menu.",

Sorry AB, Jody, Roseanne, Yuko and Doug.   The Carpaccio was cured and tasted more like Prosciutto.   The Bolognese lacked flavor and was more ground beef and dehydrated onions, with no indication of any celery or carrots. It reminded me of Scottish \"Mince\".  The Chicken Parmigiana was tough and not tender.   I could go on, but...",

We went with friends who had to change the reservation which apparently the restaurant erred in entering.  We ended up in the bar at a table which turned out ok.  For all of you \"old timers\" in the area this is in the old Pan a Vino restaurant.  The food was excellent as was the wine which was a decent pour.  The service was good.  This place will not disappoint and while I didn't sit in the dining area I suspect it is still pretty romantic.",

The giant chicken slices included were also chewy and not very edible - the female hostess had her obnoxious phone ringer on full blast - the bread was way too soft as compared to first meal. like a bakery roll.  A n ugly meal all around and hopefully our donation of $48 improves food quality. In this case Arrivederci really means goodbye forever.",

When we walked in I kid you not the place was jammed like sardines and our table was ready to go in the middle of the restaurant.  The appetizers were served quickly and I must say the sausage and meatballs were awesome.  I ordered a chicken dish with spiral pasta and veggies and it was excellent.  The desert was also impressive.  The service was top notch and you can tell lots of repeat customers as they aimed to please with good food.  I'll be back for sure.",

The owner is incredibly friendly and service is very quick, since, when they're busy, they have a team wait on you.  One person brings the bread, another takes your order, and another fills up waters.  You may not see your actual server very often, but that allows you to focus on the food.  The food, for the most part, is great.  I love the Chicken with Mushrooms.  Portions aren't too big, especially considering what you pay, but you likely won't be disappointed.  Just keep in mind the Calamari isn't fried, so if that's what you're expecting, steer clear.  One time we went, the hostess was fairly rude to my wife.  She seemed very busy, so it could have been that, but since we don't encounter rudeness at Scottsdale restaurants too often, I thought it was important to note.  ENJOY!",

My grandmother had there new eggplant parmesan, as she said it was so good and everything was cooked to perfection, nothing mushy.   My grandfather had the chapino,  It was a generous portion of fish and pasta with clams all through the sauce and shrimp; it was not spicy at all and the portion was also large.   The only faults that I saw where, The amount of noise in the small restaurant and that the parmesan cheese ,they ask you if you want any, is not fresh grated it's that powder type.

    "text": "Arrivederci is one of those little nice family owned restaurants that people keep kvetching the valley doesn't have enough of.  While it's not the best Italian food in Scottsdale, it serves up some wonderful meals at reasonable prices.  For me, it brings back memories of many little whole-in-the-wall Italian restaurants my family and I used to visit when I was growing up in Chicago and Cleveland.  As others have said, the decor is awful but easy to look past.  The \"rustic\" wall paper and wine racks probably had an authentic old school feeling 20 years ago, but the dining room could drastically use a 21st century update.  The Ferrari parked outside is cool for a quick glance, but really just serves as a fairly pointless \"wow\" device.  The food tastes fresh, the sauces are good but not overpowering to the dishes, and the service is great.  The only thing I don't recommend is the complimentary liquor shots we received at the end of our meal.  Awful.  The server said it would help with digestion.  It left me feeling like I was suffering from indigestion.",

    "text": "Two stars does feel a bit harsh for rating this place, but the description fits perfectly. \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" Three stars would be \"A-OK,\" which I don't feel describes my experience here at all.  It's not that anything was particularly bad or offensive. It just wasn't great. The roll I got before eating was harder than I would have liked, but the pesto/olive oil that came with it was quite pleasant. On the recommendation of the server, I got one of their chef's special dishes, the Ciambotta Di Pollo e Salsiccia. Again, nothing was wrong with it. It was good and I plowed my way through it quickly. However, it was far from gourmet. The sauce, while it tasted fine, was hardly distinguishable from something from a jar. The chicken and peppers were roughly cut in all sizes. Then the biggest problem with the whole experience was the price. For my lunch of only iced tea and an entree, I paid just over $20 after tax and tip. Now I don't have a problem with paying $20 for a meal, not at all. But for that price, I expect quality. What I got did not at all match up with that expectation.  I have nothing against this restaurant. I wasn't at all put off by the meal. But I can get better at Olive Garden for a lower price. I can call to mind several family-owned Italian restaurants with higher quality and lower prices. So I'll be taking my money to those.",

    "text": "So good.  The restaurant is admittedly in the most tucked away place. You'd hardly know it was there in the strip mall. Stepping inside however is an instant transformation to a charming little place.  Now when I say charming, I don't mean too fancy. It's nice and sets a good mood. The wall decor is not exactly \"out of place,\" but certainly a bit odd.   But they could paint Grimace and Burger King sword fighting on the wall for all I care if the food is good.  And the food is good.   There are moments when food has taken me to another place, where I felt as though I could leave the bounds of Earth behind me. This is not one of those times. There's nothing transcendent about the food, but it's the kind of food that tastes so good that it reminds you to eat out more often. The kind that you think about days afterwards.  The roll and pesto are a fantastic start to the meal, but dangerously addictive. It's hard to slow down to make room for you meal.  Most recently, I had the lobster ravioli. The lobster was very fresh - a rarity in ravioli. The texture was perfect and supplemented by shrimp in the wine sauce that added to the seafood flavor. The raviolis were also cooked to a great heat and consistency. I frequently found myself closing my eyes to enjoy them.  Not the most elegant of surroundings, but really great food for the price.",

However, the waiter was extremely well versed in everything on the menu and was very cognizant of the fact that it was a problem.  I think he went out of his way to give detailed explanations of  the other dishes, but I liked that.  His guest service was excellent and he did a perfect job of making us forget about the bread.    The food certainly helped.  We ordered the Rondelle 4 Formaggi which was excellent.  Waiter suggested a side of meatball to go along which complimented the dish well.  I can honestly say the meatballs were about the best I've ever had, and I've had a lot of damned meatballs.  We also ordered the Spaghetti Vongole, which had just the right mix of seafood and had an excellent flavor.  I will definitely be back, and I apologize to our waiter for forgetting his name.  Probably lack of carbs!",

The beef carpaccio was awful. The beef was over cured, it was like eating salami, and they drenched the arugula with dressing. Worst carpaccio I have ever had.  Even The pesto for the bread was awful  The main entrees were ok, we had the eggplant rolled with ricotta and the parradella pasta with sausage.

My mother-in-law is from the central region of Italy and this is her favorite place to go they even gave us complementary limoncello as an aperitif amazing. My favorite menu item is probably the lasagna or the homemade ravioli. My 1 & only complaint would be the lemonade I understand this is definitely an adult restaurant but we always bring our kids as they are little foodies in the making. I can tell the lemonade is some sort of Minute Maid / country time whatever & my kids drink it but they don't really like it and as high class as this places I think everything should be top notch. May I suggest buying Simply Lemonade from Frys or Safeway? It's really not that much more expensive and it literally tastes like it was made from scratch. Otherwise this place is perfection.",

It turned out that it was almost several evenings. Specifically made a reservation through open table for 6:45. We arrived at 6:42 and was greeted by \"Oh, well sorry it will be just a few minutes longer\" After 32 minutes of \"just a few more minutes and I'm sorries from the young hostess we were seated at 7:17 by the owner(?) and she reassured me that we would enjoy my birthday dinner. Well.. She was wrong. We had waited so long that my 17 y/o son chose not to eat since the hour was later and his diet. When the caprese salad showed up 21 minutes later it was edible at best. Finally the food arrived at 8:16. Starving was passed a long time ago and we paced our eating but still completed the veal limon in 9 minutes. The waiter offered dessert but we declined due to the hour.  Not another apology was made for the wait or delay, not a comp of a meal, not a birthday offering. At 2 hours almost exactly to when we arrived we walked out dissatisfied by the food and the restaurant. And $81 dollars lighter. This is not the first time but probably the last time we will go to Arrivederci. Went in to celebrate my 55th bday and I think by the time we left I was about to celebrate my 56th.

We then moved onto a baby greens salad and finally our choice of either spaghetti and meatballs or lasagna. The meatballs were succulent, but I'll be damned if that wasn't the best lasagna I have ever had!  The staff was professional, courteous and extremely helpful.  I look forward to returning to try out more from their main menu selections.  Thanks again, Arrivederci for hosting a great 40th birthday party for my cousin.    **Tip 1** Save time to snap a couple of pics next to the Ferrari Testarossa outside of the restaurant.  **Tip 2** Look for that red Testarossa because the place is a little hard to find!",

    "text": "Although I'd been in this shopping center before, last night was my first time dining at Arrivederci... some friends of mine were in from out of town and suggested we meet here for dinner.  I bit my tongue instead of suggesting Giuseppe's instead and figured, why not try somewhere new?  I'm happy I did.  I was extremely impressed with Arrivederci.  Service was fantastic, portions were really big, and the company was a cherry on top.  There were 5 of us total, and I think everybody was happy with our experience.  We received fresh warm rolls and a pesto-olive oil sauce off the bat... yum!  Our waters and drinks were refilled constantly which is always a big plus.  Side note - everytime I said 'thank you,' our Italian waiter replied with a 'prego' - so charming; it made me feel like I was really in Italy!  I started with the arugula salad... it was lightly dressed with a perfect balsamic, and had just the right amount of tomato, parmesan cheese and artichoke.  (I think the artichokes came from a can, but I like canned artichokes, so it was fine with me).  The others seemed to enjoy their caesar salads just as much.  For my main entree, I had the linguine vongole cozze e calamari (Linguine with clams, mussels, calamari and zucchini) in red sauce.  It was delicious!  Other dishes at our table were the spaghetti and meatballs, and a pasta dish that had Italian Sausage, chicken breast, bell peppers, zucchini, and mushrooms, sauted in white wine with a touch of tomato sauce - that was a hit as well!  We were all too full to order dessert this time, so I'll have to remember to save room my next visit.  I really don't think you can go wrong dining at Arrivederci... it's casual, charming, local, and they've proven successful since they've been open since 1995.  Cheers to many more years of success... Gratzi Arrivederci!",

There's a Ferarri Testarossa parked under a small canopy as you enter the restaurant....very retro/cool, was expecting to see Tom Selleck in the restaurant...LOL  Actually, it's pretty cool. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=XwbYXd3iwsRqfRCqoIk6iQ#XwbYXd3iwsRqfRCqoIk6iQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/arri...</a>  The place was packed when we arrived, good thing we had reservations via Open Table.  We were seated immediately and the hostess gave us our menus.  After browsing the menu for a while, we decided to order:  Caprese Salad, $7.95 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=y_S90tz4lU_fgT_T95lddg#y_S90tz4lU_fgT_T95lddg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/arri...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=a9fJ6UZMgXszy-WnM7PSHw#a9fJ6UZMgXszy-WnM7PSHw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/arri...</a>  Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Cream Sauce, $14.95 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=oGN8sA5ntpHdRBq7StXhMQ#oGN8sA5ntpHdRBq7StXhMQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/arri...</a>  Ravioli Caprese Gratinati (filled with Ricotta Cheese, topped with Parmesan & Mozzarella), $14.95 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=ZkCB534PV_uxiPYIoK_UfA#ZkCB534PV_uxiPYIoK_UfA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/arri...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=ES6PjDeRka7wgDOiBnKh5g#ES6PjDeRka7wgDOiBnKh5g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/arri...</a>  Choccamisu, $7.50 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=dBvd4nd5-k_Rz7wuR1RIuw#dBvd4nd5-k_Rz7wuR1RIuw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/arri...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=maK0iPmrp8DDWIbAxK-J-Q#maK0iPmrp8DDWIbAxK-J-Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/arri...</a>  It took a while to order our Wine and food.  They were busy and our waiter had his hands full, so the hostess came by our table and took our Wine order....that was a good thing, kept us distracted...LOL  While were waiting, a busser brought out some Bread and Oil for us...the Oil was a little different than most Italian joints...it had chunks of Tomato and green herbs & spices in it...almost like a Salsa (see pic below).  It was very good. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arrivederci-scottsdale?select=pr4ZJ1w3FnvFdudt0TlzAQ#pr4ZJ1w3FnvFdudt0TlzAQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/arri...</a>  We ordered our food and after a short wait it came out.  The Caprese Salad appetizer was very good and perfect for 2 people to share.  The portion size was just right and we didn't get full before our entrees came out.  A short time later, the entrees came out.  I sampled a little Gnocchi from The Better Half...it was very, very good...yum!  I had the Ravioli....they were cooked perfectly al dente...the Tomato Sauce was homemade with fresh ingredients and full of flavor.  After dinner, we were surprised with a complimentary shot of Limoncello from our waiter.  He said it was to help cleanse the palate for Dessert...great!  He read our mind...we ordered a Chocamisu to split for Dessert.  It came out a short time later and was heavenly...soft, creamy, sweet just like it's supposed to be.  Overall, we were very pleased with our visit to Arrivederci.  We can't wait to come back soon.  Return Factor - 95%",

Sis had the sea bass, encrusted with walnuts/breadcrumb crust, over a delicious mushroom risotto, huge portions.  Chicken Parmesan was moist, seasoned well over pasta with marinara sauce.  Great wine list and delicious red wine selection. Staff is very knowledgeable, friendly and on top of their service game.

Maybe if I ordered something else my experience would have been better. But let me go over what I thought the problem was:   Food quality: meh, the presentation wasn't bad but the actual flavor was not on point. Whether it was the overly salty sauce or the pre-cooked chicken breast they served with the plate. How do I know the chicken was a frozen pre-cook product? The fake, uniformed grill marks are a dead give-away.   Pasta however, was cooked perfectly al-dente'!   I'd say, read thru the reviews before you walk in and spend your money here.",

While eating, my wife felt something in her mouth and pulled out a single strand of hair about 6 inches long with a piece of veal stuck to the end! It was disgusting and certainly gross. Needless to say that ended our meal. The restaurant did credit both our meals. If that wasn't bad enough though the restaurant seemed to put the brunt of this issue on the server which wasn't her fault. They surely threw her under the bus. No manager or anyone in charge came over to speak to us and/or apologize. Obviously, that is our last visit to Arrivederci's!! Be careful eating there.",

We were nervous about going on Christmas Day, but the restaurant did a great job of serving everyone without making us feel rushed even though the restaurant had a steady stream of diners, including several large parties.  Loved, loved, loved the calamari in broth!  Savory, garlicky deliciousness.  The chicken and veal parmesan dishes were both flavorful and tender, but were served at room temperature rather than piping hot like we like.  The complimentary Limoncello/Sambuca was a lovely touch for a festive evening.  Our desserts were scrumptious: I had the pistachio gelato with Belgian chocolate, and my husband had the limoncello cheesecake.  Both plates were clean even though we were both full from our meals, including the airy rolls and pesto oil dip.",
