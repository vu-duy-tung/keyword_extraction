The first time I went, I ate a green chile cheeseburger that came with chips and salsa. The burger was a bit oversalted, but other than that it was very good. I also had a drink called the Pitstop which was vodka with lemon soda and strawberries, kinda like a strawbery mojito. Overall it's a great spot to enjoy an awesome patio, some drinks and (although I've yet to experience it) live music. Excited to see some music here next time I visit!",

    "text": "I think I'm in love... Not quite sure, ...no, I'm pretty sure, it's love. I've been looking for this venue. - I just didn't know it, till I arrived.  I've recently just started going to the Crescent Ballroom for local shows, and live music, after hearing about the venue from friends sometime early last year. - I've been to three shows since, with each one better than the one before it.  First of all, it's cozy. It's \"mid-sized\", seating 300-500 people. It's not huge and impersonal like a lot of phoenix venues I've been to. This place has character, and style, and I like the freedom of enjoying a drink (or two) on the patio, while readying for the show to start.  It's seriously one of the best live music venues I've been to. It's great to be able to see a decent show, in a local venue, without all the fuss of a stadium or arena setting.   They have a lounge. This area, separate from the venue's main concourse, is where you can order food and drinks, and is where the tables, patio and bar are located.  Their full-sized bar is staffed with super quick, friendly and knowledgable servers. In addition to your regular bar/venue fair, they also offer a decent selection of house specialty drinks. I've ordered both the honey badger, and the casa blanca, and would highly recommend either to a friend. I definitely intend on returning to try more of their tasty concoctions.  Their Happy Hour is from M-F from 4:30-6pm, which gets you $2 PBR's, $3 well drinks, $3 Drafts or $1 off other drinks.  If you're looking for a fun weekend night out, or a mid-week break from the norm, definitely check this place out.",

    "text": "I haven't had a chance to see a show here, but I can't wait to.  Talking with the employees, it will be a sight to be seen.  That said, there are many shows upcoming that have my interest, and I look forward to it.  I stayed for a few drinks.  They were all palatable and correct.  The decor is great - I really appreciate the handmade stuff.  The selection is pretty decent, though beers I'd say is average at best.  Being a beer person, I'm glad there's one decent pale+ here, but nothing more than that (that it's on tap helps a bit).  Somewhere around 20 beers total, four on tap, but the craft selection is a little lacking.  This happens to be a place I can order something with St. Germain though, and to me, stands out a bit.  Prices weren't crazy over the top, nor spectacular.  I imagine after food is regularly served here, the need for a happy hour will deplete (thus, I am not mentioning the very slow attendance and need for happy hour pricing).  The idea of a great drink, food and music venue is so long overthought, that I think Phoenix has pretty much forgotten about it.  Finally, after so many years of wishing, someone has guts to go ahead and do it.  I got some sampling of the soon-to-be fare, and I obviously have no qualms.  The genius behind the upcoming food here is nothing to scoff at.  The music lineup seems quite eclectic, but overall tasteful and good; I can't wait to see a show here and experience it at its fullest.  From DJs to indies.  My one qualm (as with many, many other places) is the TV, and apparent need for sports playing.  I have a major aversion to sports in a bar setting.  It removes the awkwardness of silence, therefor fueling anti-socialism (where if there was no TV, the awkwardness would be filled with conversation).  Overall: this place seems like it will become what we have been asking for over the last many years.  Already I can tell it has an aura of greatness.  Let's hope they keep it up, and retain their premier.",

From the moment I approached the door, the scintillating and seductive sounds of Flamenco Por La Vida spilled onto the street, stopping me in the front room as I passed through the doors. Apparently, they are a Saturday night staple and worth the trip alone. The front room is intimate, and the bar has a decent-above average selection of wine and beer. No food this night, but the show was fantastic and the staff knowledgeable. Great to come into a concert venue and not deal with cranky bar staff and bouncers, even for a free show. Thanks for being classy, I will definitely be back! (I am reserving the final star for once I taste the food, so expect an update at somepoint in the future.)",

    "text": "...  so you have been frustrated with the lack of any good venues in Phoenix since Nitas closed...  a gazillion years ago.  Enter The Crescent Ballroom.  This place is unbelievable.  I clocked in 3 shows the opening week and was VERY impressed.  When you enter the venue you are first in the front lounge area.  Two front patios pair the door and are ample size for open air drifters and proud smokers.  Inside the lounge, there is an airy feel due to the huge un obtrusive  door that open to the patios.  It is appointed with a nice piano for piano happy hour and DJs are occasionally assigned to play the hippest tunes.    From here you can enter the main room of the venue where the main acts play.  The stage is to the right and huge.  There is bleacher seating (like nice rich wood bleachers) along the left hand wall.  Straight ahead you will find another large bar...  don't worry about not getting a drink quick here.    The sound is amazing.  It is loud, but not hurt your ears loud.  Most likely due to the master crafting Sound man who is the resident there.  They spared no expense in equipping this place, because first and foremost, it is a music venue.  They take that business very seriously.  The show I saw were perfectly balance and a pleasure to watch.    My favorite part about this place...  you don't get pushed out the door when the show is over.  It almost feels weird to not get herded out.   The front lounge offers up the best post show spot where show goers can chat about life, music and bikes...  I have never seen such an impressive mass of hip bikes in my life.  Do yourself a favor, pick a show - any show and make a night of it at the Crescent.  It is awesome.",

As a restaurant - 2 stars - and here's why:  The Good: the guacamole appetizer - holy deliciousness.  The best I've had in a long time.  Try it.  The Bad: The Ensalada Cortado - a salad with a variety of greens and corn nuts - sounds delicious but was doused in so much dressing it was almost like a soup.  Strangely sweet while at the same time void of flavor.  Who knew?  The Ugly: The Al Pastor Pork Burrito - where to begin...  Mostly just beans, and more beans, surrounding a few slabs of fat-laden, hard to chew pork.  Not to be crass but this little beauty forced me to hit the restroom 4 times before noon the next day.  So I guess what I'm saying is, you have been warned.  Summary: I'd go back to see a show any time however I'll be eating elsewhere first.",

I like the way the red brick gently caresses the wood paneling on the outside while the lighting just softly kisses the sign on the wall. Well, I suppose enough of that soft-core design porn. Let's go into the hard-core stuff.  We got here kind of early and the atmosphere was pretty friendly. Talked to a few people on the outdoor patio that overlooks beautiful 1st Ave. Or the parking structure across the street anyways.   Service was decent to start. Waitress was attentive but no where to be found when we were leaving. Had to ask three different people for her. It was a busy night so I let it slide.   Food wasn't mind blowing, a little pricy for what's in their burrito, but the drinks were strong and reasonably priced.   The ballroom was pretty awesome. There's a second bar in the ballroom and transferring your tab is no problem. Sound system was pretty kickin' and ample seating. I'm going back for a few shows.    WOULD DO BUSINESS WITH AGAIN A++ SELLER I mean BALLROOM!",

Everything from local to national acts. I've made a couple group outings to this location with co-workers and on a fairly dead time of the day. The idea was that we wouldn't be competing for service since there was only one other table to tend to, but was I wrong. It took us over an hour for 8 of us to get our food and there were multiple occasions  where I would have loved to get another drink but it literally took 20 minutes to get a draft or mixed drink. I'd gladly go back, if the bartender is Alaina. She was awesome and very prompt. But keep in mind if you sit on the patio, the trend is 'out of site out of mind.'",

So the lounge it was.  The lounge area is pretty sparse, which works.  Just tables and chairs.  Apparently a DJ plays later, but we left a little before midnight an still no DJ.

Phoenix has needed a venue to the size and scope for WAY to long. I went and say Iron and Wine on december 2nd. The venue is what to be expected for a small room. The audio is great, the lighting is basic but meets the needs of a venue like this.  I like how they added the raised places to sit in the back, gives people somewhere to sit if they can get to the show early enough.   The bar staff was friendly, spoke with the Audio Engineer, great guy and all and all a great experience.   I will be frequenting Crescent a lot more. And Sean Watson is an amazing DJ. So there!",

Oh well I still had 3. Loved the tall glass of tangy tequila paradise to pre party for our retro guitarist friend Nick.  *The fish tacos were delicious with great seasoning! Finally a restaurant that's not afraid to flavor something simple!  *The nachos were over the top with every topping item you may dream of.  Absolutely the pinnacle of Arizona nacho happiness.  Our server was a nice professional gal- I think Melissa?  Really appreciated her listening and timing to make our night fly by talking with friends.  Everyone from start to finish at crescent ballroom was professional & patient though not overly friendly.  I can appreciate straight to the point and don't always need an emotional connection with the bartender.  As a concert venue they have the standing area with bleacher style seating in the back.  We did a combo of standing / sitting/ walking around.  The bathroom was huge with no one in there!  Usually concert bathrooms are long waits- not at this posh hipster venue!  Finally they have a bar inside the venue so we were glad for the Arizona stronghold rose & cocktails.",

Some waitstaff are pretensions and condescending and the doormen can be jerks!",

The first and only time I've come here, was to play Bingo. That statement alone should be enough evidence to myself and anyone else who will listen that my days of coolness have passed. If they ever existed at all.  This place is pretty sweet. I had dinner before Bingo because grandpa (me) knew it might be a late night and I didn't want to eat after I left here. Doing something like that would lead to a night of indigestion and no sleep. Psssh... who needs that in their life. Am I right?   I tried the carne asada quesadilla and it was unexpectedly good. I would eat here again without a doubt.   The Bingo was played in the concert area. I'm not gonna lie... it was fun. The event was put on by Jackalope Ranch and emceed by the National Comedy Theater of Phoenix. They did a great job. Funny people. Especially this guy Marcus. Hilarious.   They were all about audience participation. Like it or not. I was actually glad I never won a hand of Bingo because then you had to go up on stage and try to match wits with a trained comedian. I don't need that in my life. I'm the kind of person who thinks of a comeback 3 days later. It was a lot of fun though.   Crescent Ballroom seems like it would be an amazing live music venue. I checked the calendar and there was not one band that I knew. Oh, wait... except the Toadies. You know the \"hipster\" line, you wouldn't know who they are... Well they're right. I don't.   Bottom line is that this place is cool. A solid 4. Hopefully one day a band I know will play here and I can bump it to a 5. Until then I'll live in happy acceptance that my days of coolness are behind me.",

Not reading my ID correctly and not telling us where to go. They then told us to go behind the building to get to the correct area. Most of the employees were nice but some just were very rude about little things and treated me like a child. I will attend shows here again I just wished they were nicer to their guest.",

Funky place with a bar area and small stage/seating area. Through a door is the main showroom, I did not go there. As the 6 pm show time approached the bar filled up to capacity plus. The Flamenco troupe was outstanding, I loved it, every minute of it. Male and female dancer, female singer and male guitarist. Each and every one of them was fantastic. The audience loved them. The bar worked around all the music, serving drinks and food. The staff was friendly and did their jobs very well. Prices for drinks and food was reasonable, given there was no charge the entertainment. But, there was a bucket to pay the performers and I gave them a goodly amount as they deserved it. Seems they are not going to do this every Saturday night....so I guess I know where I will be one many a Saturday night. Flamenco is the most soulful, emotional music in the whole world and having it performed a few feet away from you is truly spectacular.",

It is not a place where little old ladies dodder around, looking for a handsome, dashing, debonair dance partner. It is also not a place for the faint of heart who wish to challenge the trivia gods on a Sunday night. It is primarily a music venue where local acts can hone their skills in front of an appreciative audience of just post adolescent audiophiles. If you do venture out on a Sunday evening to play trivia here, be prepared to be completely destroyed by the local experts. They really know their stuff.  There is some parking around back and I think you have to pay unless you are a gambler. The food choices are limited but they do have an eat-your-face-off plate of nachos that should satisfy anyone's hunger. The drink choices are quite acceptable if you can get the waiter to hear what you want. Try this place. You won't be disappointed.",

The veggies are crisp. Mango! Houston, we have mango. DH is working through the menu and has already been delighted by the Lolo Burger and Street Tacos. The desserts struggle.

Last night, my husband and I thought we were going to have to miss the Liz Phair concert because our child care situation changed at the last minute (a medical emergency with my mother). We tried to reach someone by phone at TicketFly or Crescent, but no live person could be reached. My mother's condition stabilized, but she had to be monitored at the hospital. We decided to head down to the venue to see what our options might be...right away the staff at the door was very friendly and helpful, despite how busy they all were. A gentleman whose name I did not get, said we could bring our daughter into the show as long as she wore ear covers which they could provide. It was such a relief to hear that after a very difficult day! Thank you so much for being understanding and if I knew the gentleman's name I would thank him personally. We moved back to AZ recently and this was our first time seeing a show at Crescent since being back (we used to come a lot because we love it there, just harder now with a small child). And of course, Liz Phair was amazing, so we're so glad we didn't have to miss it!",

My first move was to rummage through my purse to see if there was anything to stick in my ears. For some reason, I actually had ear plugs in my purse. I guess when you turn 30, you just start carrying crap like that around. Unfortunately, my boyfriend does not carry ear plugs or a man purse to put them in. So our second move, was to go outside on the patio. When people started smoking around us, we were forced back inside ... because smelling like smoke is now something I avoid like the plague. Then we sat on a bench and decided that if we were just going to sit there and talk to each other, we might as well go home.   Now that is sad.   I would definitely recommend this place to see a band, but for the love of God, the music in the front room is so loud it hurts. It's just not worth the hearing damage.

Just when you think you've picked a fav of the two you taste the other and change your mind. So just eat both and get the best of both worlds. My only wish they were a bit more spicy. I like my salsa hot. But that's a personal preference. The tacos - one barbacoa, one pacific chicken and one carne asada. All three were amazing. Loaded with the various proteins and their own accompaniment. Just delicious. They aren't huge, nor are they small - basically, they are Goldilocks - just right.

Fantastic deals on happy hour- recommend the Honey Badger if you're a fan of ginger beer, ginger whiskeys, etc etc.   As always I wish the drinks were a bit stronger but that's just how bars go I'd say. My one complaint is that I was really hassled at the entrance on being 21. I have a CA vertical ID, so I guess in AZ that looks a bit suspicious, but seriously?! You need to go check for five minutes, make me move into the light, shine a flashlight in my face, and question me repeatedly? I get you have a job but bro, chill.

Most other staff was A+.  Back to the division of the -21 and +21 topic. The person in control of this needs to re-think it. Wrist bands for under 21 wrist bands for over and hand stamps all over the place. I was watched all night long. Every time I went to the rest room and washed my hand I was watched. I guys they think it is just too out of character for punks to wash hands or -21 for that matter.   1/3rd of the floor was designated for -21 and really just overly dangerous for no reason. I have been to many punk shows and this one hand to be the most dangerous I've ever seen. I was even at a 600 person + Negative Approach show in Oakland on 4/19 where 30-40 people were in the circle pit. The style of the circle pit wasn't even the problem. It was the excess bouncer pressence using their L shaped and ghetto wires together barricade to keep the circle pit up front. There were people getting their heads slammed into stuff and necks whipped back left and right.  Don't book punk bands if you have no clue what your booking. If you do though, worry more about the safety of the kids and less on the convenience of the bar. So much wasted space. Less than half of the attending crowed had beers in hand. The other 3/4ths were put in unnecessary risk.   I can only judge this place from an un-carded visitor from out of state. I was there for some punk bands on 2-22-14. I prefer to avoid alcohol so no need to have an ID in a circle pit.",

Instead, real thought went into basics like the vibe and general look and feel of the place, their relatively small but quite tasty and well-priced menu, their friendly staff, and even the layout of their main stage area.   Thoughtfulness basically permeates Crescent from top to bottom and it made a concert more fun than the normal sweaty, angry ragefest most shows tend to be, to the extent that a venue can control that.  Enjoyed myself and enjoyed that they really knew what they were doing up and down the line. As venues go, probably my favorite in the state now.",

    "text": "Whether I'm here to see a show or not, I'm a pretty big fan of Crescent. It's become the default downtown bar for my friends and I, actually.  I'm a pretty big fan of live music, and whoever is booking shows at this place is doing a great job. It's a medium sized venue, and they do a pretty good job of finding bands that will fill the place, but that generally won't sell out in 10 minutes. (They cater to the local music & indie-rock crowd, mostly.) The shows generally range from $8 - $15, depending on who's playing.  One of the things I really like is that they have a front bar & patio that you can hang out  and have drinks, and not go into the show so you don't have to pay a cover. (they have inner doors separating the show area front the front bar area.)  Yes, this place tends to draw a more indie-hipster crowd than, say, a scottsdale bar... but I've always found the crowd to be enjoyably diverse in both age & style. I mean, I'm a 31 yr old dude that wears jeans & button-down shirts, and I've never been shunned or mocked by a gaggle of skinny-jean wearing ruffians. (also, a lot of it depends on what bend they have playing that day.) And, there's always plenty of cute girls. So there's that.  (last note: drink prices are pretty standard. $5 bucks for a Guinness, $4 or $5 for a cocktail. God knows for PBR. No one should drink that swill. Also, if they have Sangria, beware - taste great, good price, not much booze.)",

    "text": "I wasn't aware that the phrase 'Downtown Douchebags' existed. While fellow Phoenix brethren enjoy utilizing expressions such as 'Chandler Trash' or 'Scottsdale Douchebags', I was surprised when a friend of a friend inquired if Crescent Ballroom was indeed \"where all the downtown douchebags hung out.\" While I think it's quite normal to find douchey people across the wide spectrum of AZ, I found this particular term a bit of a misnomer. I think utopian would have been a more appropriate word to replace downtown, which was simply too broad in scope. Even so, I don't think that Crescent Ballroom has the utopian vibe associated with some local Phx spots; it's an entirely different experience.  The crowd at Crescent is diverse and impressive, and the variety in music is overwhelming. We've rocked out with the Tune-Yards, experienced the nautical dreamy music of Active Child, established rapport on the patio with Black Carl and complained about the sound issues of Portugal. The Man. We've regretted missing shows like St. Vincent, Geographer, Manchester Orchestra and M83. In September, Yeasayer is coming to Crescent. I never would have imagined finding a venue in Phoenix where I could see ALL of these bands play. I think the saddest part of that last statement is I never expected these to be the bands that I would want to see live.   Sometimes, after shows have ended, they have a DJ come out and play songs that I recognize because I shop at Urban Outfitters and then I proceed to destroy everyone on the dance floor.   It would be unacceptable to review Crescent without mentioning the food. I have consumed all of their burritos, their hamburger and cheese crisp (I add MEAT) and can confirm that the ingredients used for these items were cultivated and prepared by the Pagan gods that I will continue to worship. Beer selection is fairly adequate since I can order Hop Knot in a can. Prices for drinks are pretty normal and the price for shows will vary depending on a scale of one to Bon Jovi.   Lastly, there are a lot of parking and places to lock your bike which is very important to me because I ride a neon green fixed gear since I'm a Downtown Douchebag.",

The match had ended. We politely asked to put the soccer match on the screen as we were the only humans paying any attention in the baron bar. The bartender, Brett, denied our request and made a \"compromise\" and put the punisher on. Being that this movie sucked, we pleaded to go back to the fencing. But with no luck, we were forced to watch the punisher. Good food though.",

    "text": "I love this place.  Great small to medium-sized venue.  It is a good reason to experience downtown Phoenix.  You can take the light rail right to Van Buren and Central, and it is only two very short city blocks west.  There are many restaurants within walking distance, so it was easy to make a whole night of going to a show.  The show we saw was sold out, and yet it was very comfortable to be inside.  There was plenty of room to see the bands, and you could easily get a drink at the bar without too long of a wait or extra effort.  The drinks were priced reasonably.  I drank Tanqueray and tonic for $6 each and the wife had Stella Artois for $5 each.  The cheapest drinks were cans of PBR for $3 each.  They serve food, but we had just eaten at the Arrogant Butcher-- however I have heard they have a decent kitchen from a well respected source.  The floorplan is set up very well.  There are two entrances, east and west.  On the east side there is a lounge and dining area with restrooms and a bar.  Through a set of double doors is the stage area that has bleacher type seating in the back and plenty of standing room in the front.  The west entrance appears to be for the under 21 set during all ages shows.   Having the two entrances makes for a very quick and organized egress, which is convenient and safe.   There is a long bar along the west  wall, another set of restrooms, and an area dedicated for band merch, which was nice because we were able to talk to the opening act while they sold their own records and t-shirts.  The place is air-conditioned quite nicely.  The bathrooms were reasonably clean for how many people were there.  Overall this is a little gem in downtown Phoenix that makes me excited to get out and and actually be part of the small-but-great Phoenix night-life.",

I was intrigued when I heard it was another place to watch a good show, but it definitely became a priority when I heard that Chris Bianco (owner of Pizzeria Bianco) and Doug Robson (owner of Gallo Blanco) were in charge of the restaurant on the other side of the door.  During my first visit, we were there to support a band and only had time for chips and guac (yum), but the rest of the food looked great! I will make sure I get there with plenty of time to spare before our next trip to Crescent so i can enjoy more of what their kitchen has to offer.  As far as a music venue goes, I was impressed. Great sound, and juuuust small enough to feel intimate, but big enough to accommodate a good amount of people. Bleacher seats in the back are a nice reward for people that are early to their  show.",

Some shows with popular artists actually have tickets so be sure to check out their website before going to make sure that you're prepared ahead of time!   It can get pretty packed but the bars always have multiple bartenders and they're usually pretty on top of the crowd!

    "text": "Crescent ballroom is one of the 'cool and hip' places in Phoenix that you can typically depend on to have something going on every night. I've been to one of their concerts, music bingo, and plain old dinner/drinks. I'm not sure how often they have musical bingo, but I would recommend making it to one of those-It was a good time! In the evenings, they use candles for lighting as well as stringed lights. This adds that relaxed ambiance so many people associate the place with.   Now for the not so great... the service is  ALWAYS SO SLOW. I've been there when its busy and when it's pretty sparse and its just always slow. I don't know if this is something that you just have to expect when going to a restaurant that isn't known for good food or service but rather their atmosphere, still it can be frustrating. Maybe its just less forgivable because a couple of the servers don't have the nicest attitudes.   The food is Ok.. Their cheesy bean dip appetizer is pretty spot on.   My first time there I ordered wine and they gave it to me in a clear plastic cup..weird or is that just me?",

Foods pretty good too, simple Mexican fare, burritos, tacos, chips and salsa etc.  Service has always been friendly.  Really no complaints here, if you're looking for some music and drinks look this place up to see what's scheduled.     It's a little on the outskirts of central downtown which is what I think keeps this venue intimate yet fun.  Next time copper blues and valley bar are nuts (other downtown faves of mine) I'll definitely head this way.",

I understand people in the service industry, might be jaded to late night patrons being belligerent, but we got off work and literally just came to eat some food, then take off.  The food: My carne asada bowl was good enough to give it a 6/10.  However, my fiance's burrito was crap and our our friends Tacos were extremely mediocre.  Even after the shitty attitude from the bartender, she was still tipped 20% which looking back was not deserved.  It got worse when we finished up and this goofy little security guy came up to us and said \"you guys are wrapping this up right\".   Ummm... first of all we are all very self aware people and knew we have 20 mins left.  You don't need to come over to us and say that. We weren't bothering anyone and we were finishing up everything clearly on our own.  Maybe the staff could use some new training on how to interact with the public.",

I got a couple of tacos and they were to die for! I  was pleasantly suprised by how delicious the tacos were! They have a good selection of food and drinks during happy hour and that salsa verde they serve with their chips ($1 during HH, unbeatable! Tons of chips, too!) is so, so, so good!!  Parking is the only issue I have with this place. I'm not sure they do own a lot but you can park on 3rd Ave and Van Buren as there's a big lot there. Just make sure you have cash, $4 to be exact, because it's one of those parking lots with numbered lots where you deposit money on slots.  All in all, it's a very cool place! I really enjoyed the concert and the venue's just great for a concert like that. Location's great as it is Downtown Phoenix and they have a nice Happy Hour.

We got a recommendation to come here from our server at Nobuo (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/nobuo-at-teeter-house-phoenix#hrid:R79IFDF-hekGT9WR5Z5LtA\">yelp.com/biz/nobuo-at-te...</a>), which I highly recommend, by the way. We walked to Crescent Ballroom from the restaurant and it took us maybe 15 minutes. On a rather quiet block, it was the only lively place that was protruding sound. There were so many people inside and outside and in the ongoing concert room. People were out having a good, casual time with friends while a show was going on in the next room.   Although I have no idea who was playing that night, I had no interest in paying to see it. I just came to check out the scene and grab a drink. There's a lounge with a bar and an outdoor patio. I heard after the concert is over, usually a DJ comes out and spins but we didn't stay long enough for that. We sat down at a table in the lounge and probably stayed for about an hour. It was interesting to see how the Phoenix locals were, but it was awkward being there since mostly everyone else came with large groups of friends.   I guess now that I think of it, Crescent Ballroom could very well be like House of Blues in SD (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/house-of-blues-san-diego#hrid:Wd0QJ16zgg70FsX0vHsQGQ/src:self\">yelp.com/biz/house-of-bl...</a>), but Crescent Ballroom was just a smaller venue that does it way better. It's a cool place with a good layout that I wish we had here in SD.",

    "text": "Every time I go to Spain, I have to check out flamenco. The traditional Spanish dance is so beautiful and full of spirit, with colorful costumes, energetic music, and emotive singing. While you can catch it weekly at Pepin in Scottsdale, I was really smitten with a recent flamenco performance I saw at Crescent Ballroom, which features free flamenco every Saturday night from 6-8 p.m.  The performances are done by local flamenco dance troupe Flamenco Por La Vida. When I went, there were two ladies and a guy tearing it up on the small stage at Crescent's lounge area, and they alternated dancing while a guitarist strummed. It was captivating and intimate, and about as close as you can get to an authentic Spanish experience. Sip on some of Crescent's sangria, and enjoy!  Also, besides the awesome flamenco -- I'm in love with Crescent's food (the chips and burritos are amazing!), and the sound and atmosphere at the concerts is always high-quality and friendly. It's an all-in-one amazing place!",

The prices are all reasonable, and they have a happy hour and daily specials as well if you're looking for extra savings.  I have yet to see a show here, but I've only heard good things about it from multiple people so I am very much looking forward to my first time. From what I've seen on their calendar, they offer a variety of high-quality free shows as well as cheap and moderately priced gigs. Trivia night 6-8 pm on Sundays is becoming a favorite tradition of mine. Just make sure you get there early enough if you want to sit inside (I'd say get there around 5 if you have more than three people).",

Whoever books for them does a great job, and I feel they can be credited for stimulating the shows that come here. Before five years ago, I would have to travel out of town or state to see a decent gig, things have all changed and I truly feel the CB had a lot to do with that and with inspiring other venues like Valley Bar, to follow suit (may be the same owner too, idk). Secondly, I love that their audio engineers are varied and experienced and many of which get hired from local Audio Engineering school CRAS, the best  school for AE and live sound. Thirdly, their food, everything about their food is amazing.",

So amazing, that I may or may not know someone who decided to \"borrow\" them for future use.   Hipster central, so just be prepared for a lot of flannel, beanies, and skinny jeans.

The restaurant is good but they could offer some less expensive options-- it is a venue after all.   The sound is hit or miss, it tends to be bass heavy and blows out the other instruments. They tend to not care much about mixing for local or supporting bands unfortunately.  The wait staff is nice. The security is the worst only second to The Marquee. I probably went there 2-3'x a week for a year before anyone in that place even began to remember me. Others of my friends have been harassed about their ID's which was totally bogus. Other venues seem to make an effort to know their regular customers . This place seems like they couldn't care less -- it comes across as pretentiousness. For this reason I'll give them a 3 instead of a 4. Embrace your community that pays to keep money in your pockets and your doors open.",

Its just such a crappy venue compared to the wonderful crescent. Whether it is a HUGE sold out show or a free local band, any night at the Crescent is a good night. I just wish people would stop getting up in the front of the dance floor and just hangout on their phones the whole time I MEAN COME ON!

Every bartender  I've encountered makes a mean drink and is super friendly, even if you're one of the annoying \"no close it out\" and return 20 minutes later for another round types. It's also pretty damn cheap for downtown. Tall cans of Stella are $5, $4 during happy hour. Most drinks are around $5-6.   They have trivia on Sunday nights, shit gets wild.   Oh and the food!!

After being told to sit anywhere we'd like, we went to take a table outside which hadn't been cleared of dirty silverware and water glasses.  That didn't bother us, but once we sat we were admonished to get up until someone has been able to clean it up.  So, we stood and waited for a several minutes, despite the fact that it was early and relatively slow, before deciding to just grab a table inside instead.  I ordered a beer - it was lukewarm.  My wife's tacos fell apart in her hands when she went to pick them up (perhaps sitting too long in their single layer corn tortilla).  We mentioned it to our waitress who simply responded \"duly noted - I'll let someone know\".  No attempt to rectify the situation was made.  While still eating, I needed to feed the meter outside and asked change a $5 bill for some quarters, only to be told \"we don't make change for the meters\"... OK, that's weird.  Fortunately, the bartending was willing to help me out from his tip jar.  We'll still come back, and hopefully our next experience and review will be better.",

It's smaller and a much more intimate experience with fans and artists. Ticket prices vary but aren't as outrageous as other venues with sky rocketed fees. $20 was all we paid per ticket. The place has 2 full bars with decently priced cocktails and cheap beers. It's standing room general admission with a \"bleacher\" style seating towards the back of the venue. The show was 16+ but they had a special section for the underage crowd that was up front side stage so they could enjoy too. The venue is great especially if an artist you really like is playing and you want a more personal fan based experience.",

When we first got there, parking was everywhere so you can basically find parking anywhere since it next to ASU downtown campus. We were greeted very friendly by the staff who took our tickets. A line was form outside of the venue and for those who are under 21 will be escorted to the back of the venue who gets to go in first. The venue is so nice and very well organized. They had benches for people who didn't want to stand. I didn't have time to try their food but heard great reviews about it-will definitely give it a try another time.   The concert went great and didn't have any issues!",

With an intimate setting, seating is limited to bleachers or standing room, but please don't be tempted to sit on the bottom bleacher, you won't be able to see the stage over the crowd standing in front of you.  Crescent ballroom is hands down, one of my favorite music venues in town. They get well known touring musicians as well as unknown local bands playing on this stage and there seems to be something exciting every night of the week. I've seen Macy Gray play here, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Judith Hill, and CeeLo Green to name a few. I highly suggest finding them on Facebook and following their feed. It's the most effective way to keep up with the shows coming across their stage.   Drinks are available at two bars in this venue during most shows and the bathrooms behind the bar in the concert hall is usually much shorter of a wait than the one in the dining hall. I've not had the food here, but that's usually because I've already eaten, but I hear it's pretty good!  Happy Yelping Phoenix, go out, catch a show and have an awesome time! :-)",

I was pleasantly surprised by the drink/food menu and the kind and prompt greeting from the female bartender. The food was good and they have One of my favorite vodkas that Nobody else has in Arizona. The male bartender last night was a total tool and a complete ahole... I showed up at 6 and the show didn't start until 8 so I was there early because it was on my way home from work and decided to avoid traffic. I was eating and drinking and I around 7/7:30 people started to cash out at the bar and get up and leave they started to take the stools, but nobody asked me to move... When more people started coming up to the bar to order drinks I still just sat in my seat enjoying my beverage and even got another one. I was sitting at the end of the bar closer to the patio. Shortly after I heard the mail bartender say \"I can't believe we have a line because of one f*cking seat.\" I wasn't so much surprised to hear him cursing because he dropped the F bomb and curse-words behind the bar more that he spoke regular words but I just assumed that's the type of establishment that is except none of the other employees did. I've run a bar before and I've been a bartender and if they didn't want people sitting at the bar after a certain time so that they could serve the numerous amounts of people walking up to get drinks they could have just asked and I gladly would have moved outside which I did after the bartender decided to be a complete and total asshole. I still left a 20% tip I'm not going to threaten that I'm not coming back or I'm gonna tell my friends to not go there because anybody in the industry knows that's just a dumb thing to say and the other staff members were just great and it's a really cool establishment and I'm glad I got to experience it but that mail bartender the one who's getting ready to leave for Denver apparently is a piece of sh*t.   And I apologize for any grammar or spelling mistakes as I'm using speak to text.",

There is plenty of outdoor seating, both upstairs on a balcony, and downstairs on a patio surrounded by misters! If it's too hot, inside is cute as well. The tacos are where it's at! The tortillas are soooo greasy and authentic... my favorite is the pastor. There are little chunks if pineapple inside, yum! During happy hour they are a great deal. The micheladas are great also. The waiters/waitresses have always been so friendly. There are nights with free music, so keep an eye on their schedule. I definitely recommend Crescent Ballroom if you are looking for a Taco Tuesday happy hour!",

And then he changed his mind after a few seconds. Maybe because he realized that he couldn't by law deny us entry to the restaurant. Since they have to legally serve all patrons. We ordered food. Simple. Two tacos, bean dip and two drinks. Meanwhile, they are closing up all around us. Making us feel extremely uncomfortable and kicking everyone out that is hanging out on the patio. We decide to eat our food quickly since we are made to feel like we are an inconvenience. I have my cup of ice. Which is my old drink. I step outside with my cup. I have the midget security come out, knock my cup of ice out of my hand, and tells me that I'm costing the venue their liquor license. It's because of people like me that he can't be nice. He did me a favor by letting us in. Really?? He continues to talk shit to me until he walks away. Worst experience ever. And I have been coming to this venue since it opened. But apparently now they have dumb midgets as security guards. It's laughable.",

My favorite is the seafood chowder, which unfortunately is not sold in the warmer months. It's my favorite soup in town.  They recently upgraded their street tacos by wrapping the excellent fillings with fantastic freshly made corn tortillas.  They also just added fresh masa sopes that are excellent.

After making the bartender aware that the person in front of me cut in line, I proceeded to give her my order. As soon as I broke eye contact with her to let my friend next to me know she was ready to take her order, the bartender rudely stopped serving me and took the order from the person who cut in front of me. I clearly brought to her attention that I was giving her my order when she stopped giving me her attention and boldly took the order of the person who cut in line. The bartender told me I was not giving her my order fast enough so she just took the next order in the middle of my own. I decided to talk to the manager about how rude her bartender was to me and my friend. She told me she could do nothing about what happened. She told me that they are very busy and her staff has to move fast. I let her know that I would at the very least like an apology from the bartender. She told me she can't do that because she can't \"Mother\" her and make her apologize. Eventually she offered to have the bartender talk with me. I again let the bartender know that as a former bartender myself, good customer service is essential for your business. This bartender had been taking my friends drink order all night long. For her to say that I was taking too long to order does not justify her behavior. When I served customers all night long, I pretty much knew their drink preference. I was very clear with my message to her and very precise when the manager of the club interrupted me and demanded that I \"Stop yelling\". It's a bar. It is loud. I was not yelling, however my tone was a bit sharp and my inflection was stern, but I was not yelling at anyone. I wanted my message to be received without misunderstanding. The manager continued to interrupt me while I was talking to the bartender. The bartender eventually did apologize, but I then had an issue with the manager insisting that I stop yelling. I continued to remind her I was not yelling, I was projecting my voice so both she and the bartender could hear me. I decided to end my evening and make my exit early. I will not return to this establishment in the future. I will also stop recommending this venue to family and friends",

We hung out outside for a while, loved seeing everyone who walked up right in front. The restaurant section is cool, we want to go some time during the day. The drinks were really reasonable and the bartender was great. The venue is a good size, and everything was set up really well.  I went one other time for a private event, which I did not know about previously. They had the restaurant and venue part shut off from each other and the guest's at the event didn't even realize there was another side.  I would definitely book this place up if I needed an awesome location and wanted to hire a live band to play. It was perfect.",

My friend plays here and her band gets paid decently. You have to appreciate a venue that pays musicians for their talent and the crowd they bring in. If you have ever been to NY or LA you know many venues have a \"pay to play\" system. Not cool.  Food is good and decently priced. Most beers on tap. Decent options for drinks and wine.  Great place to experience downtown Phoenix's music scene. Yes we have a music scene. It's just completed spread out across the metropolitan area we call home.",

I have been to this venue 6 times, every time   I go I have subpar service!! Whether it's the server or the bartender there is this \"i don't give a fuck \" attitude about the customer!! Call me \"old school \", but businesses especially a food/entertainment establishment should pride itself on the customer experience!! I am not asking for a five star resturant or hotel experience , just a humble/ attentive basic customer experience!! I'm not going to name names but the servers here are way undertrained when it comes to the \"customer experience \" in my opinion. Take my order and be polite and accommodating  if need be. That's all I ask! But you will not even get that \"basic\" customer experience here!! Sad to say but this place is sub par at best and I can have a better experience at the rebel lounge or marquee theatre or even Club red!!! At least they are all about the customer!!! I have played many of these venues and I would never! Never !! Play this venue just based on how it's ran and the people are trained! What a joke!! Don't waste your hard earned dollar!!",

They have a constant flow of amazing bands and artists, their food is delicious (you can't go wrong with a burrito conceptualized and created from the chef/owner of Pizzeria Bianco), their drinks are poured and priced right, and the staff is typically very friendly. Sound quality during the shows is always right on, and the space itself is really nice. Definitely not dingy or a dirty hole-in-the-wall like a few other PHX music venues.  The only downside I can think of is that parking can be an issue. Try to get there early and you won't have to drive around looking for a space too long.",

It has great acoustics, it doesn't get groggy and hot, the bathrooms are always clean, and the bar is a nice size - I've never had to wait behind two rows of people trying to grab a drink during a show. There's a \"pit\" area as well as stadium bench seating and no matter where you choose to sit/stand you can both see and hear perfectly well - something I as a petite 5'3\" girl can really appreciate.  I also love the restaurant half of the place. It's a great during-the-week hang out to grab a few cocktails and watch an acoustic set in the dining area. The food is surprisingly delicious - I had the bean & cheese burro w/ veggies. Sounds like nothing special but the toasted tortilla and smokey, creamy chipotle salsa really had me feeling better about spending $8 on a bean and cheese burrito. And it's an added bonus (for me at least) that they have churros for dessert. Can't beat cinnamon & sugar fried bread dipped in cajeta (thick caramel sauce made from goat's milk). SO GOOD.  Affordable shows (with some really great lineups) , good food, and booze. Need I say more?",

Thanks, asshole, this place doesn't charge you up the ass for a drink or anything, anyway...  Later on that night, the bar lost my friend's ATM card, and as she periodically checked the balance, she saw that at least one charge she wasn't present for at $2 went through.  Lovely.

It started more like quarter til 9pm and there were two intermissions that lasted more than thirty minutes until the headliner came on. It's probably not the vendor's fault, more the lack of preparation from the bands.

The meal did come with a couple of chips and by a couple, I mean a couple. Menu seemed focused on Mexican cuisine and with that, I would assume you would get chips before the meal. Not the case. They did have specials for food and drink which is nice, just didn't apply to my meal today. Given that, the price of my meal did seem a bit high for lunch. If you can set your meal to fall on the day of one of their specials, the price point would be more favorable. Our server was very fast and friendly but the place seemed short staffed to handle a busy lunch crowd. Overall, the place again appears great for music and drinks, but I was there for just the food and it was average given the price and quality.",

I highly recommend it.  Indoor seating is tight so come early. Food and drink are reasonably priced. The tacos are street style sized portions for $3 or $4 a piece. The carne asada can be enjoyed without adding any further spice. The blackened tilapia tasted like ... tilapia. (The non-flavored fish of the world.)  Beer runs anywhere from $3 to $5 on a normal day. Happy Hour is Monday 11AM-6PM and Tuesday-Friday from 3PM-6PM. Draft beers are a buck off.  I dinged a star for two reasons. Service was hard to come by for some reason. Perhaps they slow down service during a show to avoid distracting the performers? Or they would like folks to drink two beverages only? The other terrible situation is the number of bathrooms. On the restaurant side there is only a single occupant woman's bathroom. Unfortunately for us that night, there was barely any water running in the sink. (Which made for a long line.)",

There is seating in the back if you need to rest, the place is intimate, the acoustics seemed good... In fact, it was great until people started showing up.  The problem with Crescent is the scene.  If you want to hang out and chat (loudly) with a bunch of hipsters, it's probably the place for you.  If, however, you are there to actually listen to a live band, good luck hearing the slow songs over all the chatter.  The parking situation is also pretty annoying.  You really do need exact change, and there's no other obvious place to park nearby with an actual parking attendant.  In all fairness, it's really a decent little venue.  The live music is just unfortunately secondary to the social scene.",

I went here with my sister for the Blitzen Trapper show last night. I hadn't been before but I had read some good reviews below and this place hit the marks.   The place has an outdoor patio and indoor seating that make for a perfect hangout spot pre-show. They can open up the walls when the weather is nice so everything is so open and airy. I heard the food was decent, but we had dinner elsewhere so I wouldn't really know - except I was tempted at 12:00am after the show to order up one of their churros. The drinks were really good. I had the rest stop which was delicious.   You can hear the music at a nice level from the outside area, but not enough to prevent conversations with friends and fellow drinkers. The venue isn't too huge so you feel like you are experiencing a pretty rockin show with everyone around you. The sound quality to me seemed great minus a few occasions where I thought the ringing of my ears wouldn't stop, but I blame the band Dawes for simply rockin the house down before the main act go on stage.   There is seating in the back and on the sides so you if you don't want to stand don't worry there is plenty of room to sit. There is a bar in the back to order drinks and on the other side the band usually sets up show with their merch. There are also plenty of bathrooms in the back so don't fret if there is a long line at the front where there is only one stall.   Can't wait to go back here again. FYI - if you take the light rail after 11:30pm make sure you are parked at the right spot because they don't run on the full track. We made that mistake and had to cab it the rest of the way while some poor souls had to walk.",

I like the atmosphere of the place but was a little disappointed that the cocktail I paid for was at first delayed and finally not available after about ten minutes of waiting (due to lack of ingredients). I'll give the benefit of the doubt and say that they are still getting up and running but that was still a bit of a shocker.  Haven't tried the food here yet but I'm eager to come back and take in some more live tunes and have a few cocktails.",

It's as if the owners/designers thought, \"What do people want before, during, and after a concert?\" (Then they correctly answered, \"Booze, burritos, and more booze. We'll throw plenty of clean bathrooms in there for good measure.\")  The other night I got the chance to see St. Vincent at CB. The concert space is a great size - it fits plenty of people (even with places to sit!) - but you still get to be at one of those intimate shows where you can SEE the band. And if I'm going to a St. Vincent concert, I want to SEE the beautiful Annie Clark as she's playing. Not just a humanoid shape on a stage so far away that I can only assume that it's the band that I hear playing.   If your favorite band is playing at Crescent Ballroom, do not miss the opportunity to see them at this venue. It is a great addition to downtown Phoenix with a bonus of being located only a block away from the lightrail stations. Get there early for some food and drinks too.",

    "text": "Best stage in Phoenix for local and/or small to medium sized acts, period. I went here for the Slackers concert (and the Twotone Lizard Kings who I actually came to see), and was really impressed.  My first impression, I had to say was not really positive. It seemed like a new hipster hangout (which it somewhat is, I suppose), and because of the small lounge in the front with the small lounge stage, I thought that the venue part of things was going to also be much smaller. Well, I was wrong. The venue is huge, the stage is huge, and the sound system is absolutely amazing.  I really like the layout of the venue as well. It's difficult to describe (and it probably varies), but Ill say that a little more than 3/4 of the room and half of the stage is devoted to the 21 and up crowd, while the other half of the stage is general admittance for anyone. They have a wisely located merchandise corner. The bar was very big, but out of the way enough so as not to cause \"traffic\" problems, and placed in such a way that by getting a drink, you will not miss a second of the show. They also serve food here, and the drinks did not seem to be wildly overpriced as they usually are at such venues. Further, there are about 5 rows of bleacher seats in the very back for those that prefer their entertainment sitting down rather than standing up. The divider between the general admittance and the drinkers is a convenient place to rest a drink or an elbow whilst enjoying the show.  Everything about this place is just smart. Im a professional musician, and I will gladly advocate that this place has the best sound system in phoenix. The vibe is just right--fun and electric. The stage is big enough for a band of 10 people.  Im hoping that they will embrace some heavier music in the near future, maybe a couple nights a month or something. I understand the type of crowd they are seeking, but really think they would be missing out on a resource of Arizona that has gone untapped for a long time now.  I will definitely be back. Hopefully, Ill also be there soon to play their stage. If the night I had here was anything to judge by, that gig would be would be one hell of a night.",

This is coming from someone who worked in the indie music business for 5 years, 1.5 of those years spent touring so I've seen my share of venues.   I don't know what this place would be like with a DJ or full rock band, but it was great so an acoustic act and I hope the shows I want to see coming through town play here.   I also love that its a restaurant/bar. I would hang here just for dinner or drinks. Plus the bands play loud enough you can hear them from the restaurant. So I guess if the show is sold out or you are flat broke you can still hear whoever is playing.  Excited to take my bf here next week for the Revival Tour.",

I stepped in and the place was full which was understandable but my friend and I where literately standing for 15 minutes without being acknowledged. Several servers walked by, stared at us and never once approached us to ask if we needed anything or perhaps to tell us that the place was closing soon because they did have a sold out event right after flamenco which I was aware of before going in. Needless to say that my friend and I where confused, felt awkward, and left very disappointed in the place and we did not even get to try their food!",

The lighting and sound are fantastic!  It is well-staffed, and even at a sold-out show, I never had to wait long for service.  It's a beautiful example of adaptive re-use, and most decidedly exactly what downtown needs to see more!  They clearly know their audience, too.  There were two large bike racks, which we were happy to see, since we biked the short distance to the venue from home.  The lounge is also cool; I will review the kitchen separately.  It was so gratifying to see so many people walking/biking/light-railing home after the show.  If you are a fan of live music, you will most definitely want to check out The Crescent Ballroom.  Well done!",

As for appetizers I also go with their chips and salsa, a favorite snack of mine. It comes with fresh thick and crispy tortilla chips and two types of salsa. One is a salsa verde that is very fresh and delicious and the second is a red salsa that is spicy,  garlicky, and delicious! In the past I ordered their chicken tacos for dinner which were very good, last time I ordered their Sinaloa Seafood Chowder and I was wonderful! It came with perfectly cooked chunks of fish, shrimp, tomatoes and other yummy vegetables. My boyfriend always orders their bean and cheese burrito which he always loves. If you're going for a show definitely come early to catch a yummy bite to eat!",

    "text": "Ok. So I have lived in smaller cities that have excellent places to see live music & I have lived in large cities that have an awful live music scene & pretty much no-where for it to happen. I don't think people realize how good they have it here! This place is fantastic! There is a large dance area plus bleacher-style seating around the back wall so a person can sit but still see. The employees I encountered were all really nice, friendly, and helpful. I was on a rolling scooter when I went due to a recent surgery & everyone was accommodating (which shocked me since I WAS putting myself in the position of being in a crowded music venue), no one ran into me or fell on top of me, and I could see the bands the whole time. What I was most impressed about was that it was a 16+ show. My 17 year old little sister was in town visiting & wanted to go dancing & I couldn't find any other place other than the Crescent Ballroom that had a live show she could go to. Normally, I would have seen it as a negative to have a bunch of little kids at a show but the Crescent does a great job of keeping the under 21 separated AND they got to be right up front. Great idea! No alcohol directly up front, but outside of the little separator gate you can drink all you want. The only negative was that it did seem like there were a lot of complainey people in the crowd that didn't seem to want to be there. Weird. Maybe that's the cool thing with certain groups/ages- to go to things and pretend you don't like it but stay anyway. It was a pretty diverse crowd in general though, which is always great.",

    "text": "I went to the Crescent Ballroom to see Phantogram with local opening act YUS on November 5, 2011. I have been waiting to see the new venue everyone has been talking about for quite some time. Knowing that looking at reviews before going would narrow my thoughts; I refrained and went with an open mind. I noticed that the venue was also a bar/restaurant which I found pretty cool. When I arrived and presented my ticket to the hostess in the front of the venue, I was left confused as to why I was sent to enter through the back of the venue rather than the front. I later realized that the venue was split into two parts, one for those under 21 and one for those 21 and older. Me being placed in the 21 and under section I was pleased to see that they had free lemon water along with benches to rest on. I went to the restroom within the first few minutes of being in the venue and was dissatisfied with the low lighting due to me not being able to see my belt loops.  The show started at around eight forty five with opening act YUS, who played about a forty five minute set. I really enjoyed his music and knowing that he was local added to the enjoyment. I also couldn't help to notice the quality of the sound coming from the speakers; it had the best treble to bass ratio I have heard in an Arizona venue. Knowing that Phantogram has a far heavier sound than YUS I was really interested in seeing how to speakers would size up. To my surprise the sound was great, along with an amazing light show. The synchronization of the lights with the beat of the music greatly added to my appreciation for this venue. Overall I was really impressed with the newest addition to venues in the metropolitan area. Though the lighting in the bathroom was very dim and the separation of the venue was somewhat irritating, I had nothing but an awesome experience. I would suggest anyone who has an interest in independent music to check the lineup for this venue and attend.",

Every show I've seen here has sounded fantastic. A.  Parking: easy enough. Plenty of metered street parking that becomes free at 8. Pay lot across the street for $5. Also very close to the light rail stop. B+.  Food: Decent. Priced right. Had the barbacoa burrito and it was pretty tasty--better than Chipotle's, anyway. Good chips/salsa too. Wouldn't go out of our way to eat here, but if you're there and you're hungry, eat up. B.  Bathrooms: There is a one-seater in the lounge (sucks for the people just hanging out in the lounge--the line can get long) and a large, extremely clean one in the music venue area. Never had to wait in line or hold my breath. A.  Drinks: We were there the night they were sort of creating the Honey Badger and were lucky enough to be given a free sample. Hooked. They do cocktails right there. A.  Beer selection: Meh. Probably the only thing I'm going to find to complain about is the beer selection. Two bars--one in the lounge and one in the venue--and they have slightly different beers on tap. So you can get a Hoegarten in the venue but not in the lounge. They have a Sierra Nevada on tap along with a couple of Four Peaks beers and Stella (I think) and that's it for the taps. A few more crappy domestic canned selections rounds it out. I think they could do a lot better here.  You're using local chefs that use local ingredients to create menus here--why not take advantage of the local beer scene? Four Peaks is overused and overrated as far as I'm concerned, but people like it (I get it). How about some Sonoran? Prescott brewing? Nimbus?  C.  End of the day--I'm thrilled this place exists. I hope it puts the Clubhouse under.",

I love the bleacher style seating in the back, for those shows you don't feel like standing at...genius idea.  Everything about this place, is the perfect size.  Chris Bianco, of Pizzeria Bianco, and Doug Robson, of Gallo Blanco (located in the Clarendon Hotel) oversee the menu here and they offer some vegan options, so it is an automatic win in my opinion!  Not a huge menu, but it is just enough.  You can eat, have a few drinks and then head in to the ballroom for the show....makes for a nice evening.  And when there isn't a show happening, it is open for business as usual and DJ's are spinning some of your favorite tunes.  All in all, I dig this place and highly recommend it.",

For an outside dining experience to be completely overwhelmed by constant smoke I feel is really inappropriate.

We didn't have to go to the bar inside because we brought our drinks from dinner but it looked like people were getting good service.

However, they do not have shade in several areas. In AZ that's definitely a must or else you're just miserable. Also, lunch time is usually slower in service.  If you're a fan of salads you HAVE to try their Cocina 10 Ensalada. I usually get it with chicken and it's amazing! It's pretty large so I always take some to go.  I have them at 4 /5 stars and it'll be dropping as we continue wait... I'm currently here with the sun beating on me (15 minutes of waiting).  **UPDATE**  I'm happy with their happy hour but when it comes to their LUNCH time, their service is very slow.  Also, there is definitely not enough tables to accommodate everyone during this time.   Love this place but geeezzz. Get more servers and tables.",

I've personally been shoved and cussed out by one bouncer for getting ice out of a cooler (after another employee had told me it was ok.) Later witnessed the same bouncer grab a guy out of the audience and shove him offstage for crowdsurfing. Apart from the security the under-21 barrier concept is ridiculous. They put up a metal barrier to separate those that are underage and over. This in turn led to several people falling and being shoved into the barrier. Overall, if you wanna see a show at a venue around the same size you'd be better off going to the Rebel Lounge or The Trunk Space, half the price and a much better show.",

As we played we ordered the chips and salsa and a side of guacamole, which were average; my fiance got the sangria, which was really good; and I ordered their house beer (Lucha Libre Lager), who was alright nothing special just your run of the mill American lager. BUT our waitress was awful, ruined our experience. On the crescent website the promotion for trivia night includes $1 chips and salsa and the side of guacamole is $3 according to the menu. We got the check and we were charged $3 for the chips and $8.50 for the guacamole, I asked about it and our waitress said I brought you out a full portion, you ate it all and now you have to pay for it. I told her all we ordered was a side of guac and she said the same thing again. And for the chips, I showered her the website and she told us that the website is wrong. I asked to see a manager and there was none to be found according to her and one other waitress. We would have come back for trivia night and other events all the time cause we loved the atmosphere but sadly the waitress killed everything and we probably won't be coming back",

Every spot has an excellent view of the stage, multiple bars which kills long waits for drinks...really great all around. The reason I can only give them 3 stars though is because their outside/parking lot shows. These shows feel like a money grab. Pack as many people as you can into a hot, empty parking lot and enjoy! Really crappy experience. I'll never go to another show they have outside again. I recommend seeing a show here if it's inside...but if it's outside....my advice, take a pass.",

This is a great place to come for a show or just to hang out and grab some food or drinks. There is always something awesome to check out here no matter what day of the week. Most of the shows do have some sort of cost, but it is usually worth the price. I have seen tons of shows here in the past and had a wonderful time. The venue is very personal and offers a wide array of options for you to enjoy the show, including lots of standing room, high table tops, and stadium blenchers in the back. Inside the venue there are conveniently located bathrooms, the merch table and a bar.  Drinks - The bottled beer selection here is pretty decent but the draft selection of beers is very limited. I would recommend sticking to hard liquor here. The Vodka Sodas here are some of the best and strongest in town. After just three of these drinks you will be feeling very good. They also carry a personal favorite of mine, Templeton Rye whiskey. A glass on the rocks will run you $10, but it is well worth it.  Food - I have heard many good things about the food from the Crescent, but I have only ever ordered the nachos.  These nachos are awesome though! They are delicious but expensive at ~$13. However, they can easily feed 2-4 people so the cost is not that bad unless you are the one treating the table. I am very interested in coming here during the day to try other food. Most of the menu is extremely affordable and sounds delicious, especially for a concert venue.  Staff/Service - I have only been here at night, but it is pretty typical not to receive any sort of table service if you are at the front room or on the patio. I would recommend ordering all drinks and food up at the bar. The bar staff are super nice and work quickly to get everyone's order taken care of. If you are ordering food they will give you a card to bring back to your table so someone else can deliver your food.  I love the Crescent Ballroom and it is by far one of my favorite spots in town. If you like live music you have to give this place a try. The staff, drinks, food or music will not disappoint you. This concert venue and bar has a great vibe!",

    "text": "Finally. A downtown mid-sized venue that caters to great, independent music artists. Add some incredible Mexican street fare to the mix and Crescent Ballroom should rocket to the top of most folks' \"try list\".  The establishment is on the small side- so expect large crowds and little room to navigate when top acts are performing. A small patio area gives way to the hipster inspired interior. I mean, there's PBR cans selling by caseloads- need I say more? The \"dining\" area seats maybe 50 on a good day so it's a little packed. If you can find time to get to CB early and order some food, do it. It's divine. Incredible way to soak up some of the alcohol you may be ingesting, and your taste buds will thank you.  Walk through the dining area, past double doors, and into the \"stage\" area. For the most part- standing room only with some cascading bleachers lining the back wall (those seats go fast every time). There's another small bar area in the stage room and even serves some basic food (tacos, burros, nachos). The acoustics are great, not really a bad spot in the entire room. It can get a little hot/stuffy so dress smart - especially in the warmer months. You're not far from the artists- so this is definitely to be considered an \"intimate\" setup.   There's a parking lot near the venue (3 minute walk) and costs $4 (exact change required). Other than that there are metered spots all along 2nd Ave. (free on weekends and evenings) and plenty of \"free\" parking within blocks of the joint. You may have to walk a bit to get to CB, but only if you arrive late (on time).  Staff is pleasant, and helpful. But you'll be coming back for the music, food, and drinks. I would definitely rank CB as simply a great place to hang out with friends. The music makes the place on the louder side so don't expect deep conversations, but you can still get your point across. Besides, you're there to listen to Iron & Wine, Twin Shadow, St. Vincent, Yeasayer, Tallest man on Earth, and Grimes anyway right? The CB web site is well done- make sure to bookmark and keep your eye on the artist calendar. There are constant reasons to keep coming back and the general price of tickets is always reasonable ($8-$20 depending on the act).  have fun!",

It is one of the more authentic, laid back venues in the area and it's a great addition to the downtown scene.  I only go to Crescent for a specific concert or show.  I have never gone \"just to hang out\" but I know it would be a great spot for that as well.  I love a good concert, especially new independent music.  Crescent brings some wonderful bands to Phoenix who you wouldn't be able to see otherwise.  There are so many bands that are uber successful now but I first got to see them at a small, intimate concert at Crescent.    The food and bar are above average for a concert venue.  The food is somewhat mexican themed with some salads and breakfast sandwiches mixed in.  It's inexpensive and good quality.  I recommend the bean dip and tacos.  Always a good choice!   The drink selection is good if you're into beer and hipster cocktails.  My only complaint is that they only have 4 beers on draft and I love draft beer.  But they have a large selection of cans.  The mixed drinks are interesting - especially the Honey Badger which is a bourbon version of a moscow mule.    I think Crescent does a great job of cultivating a friendly, artistic scene in Phoenix and I am looking forward to many more visits in the future!",

The option to stay up front to avoid a cover or concert ticket is nice.   Sound quality is decent, not immaculate. There are bleachers against the back wall if you want to be seated to watch the show, and standing room in front of that. The only thing that's awkward is the divider that restricts alcohol in certain areas of the floor. I'm assuming it's for 18+ or all ages shows, but it's still just kind of weird to me. It's been configured differently each time I've been there. Regardless, nice spot to check out a show.",

When I was out with my boyfriend and some friends, I had gone by myself to the restroom and on my way saw a pair of guys drunkenly verbally harassing any women walking by. The place was packed and as I walked passed them, one grabbed my butt. I turned around and grabbed the guy by the arm and confronted him about it. He laughed it off and denied it. I went into the restroom and tried to hold back tears from feeling so embarrassed and humiliated. I told my friends and they suggested that I tell the security there. I went to one of the guards that was just about to go do something and he immediately stopped what he was doing and asked me where he was. He got his manager and they proceeded to remove the guy from the premises. I had seen this security guard a few times before at Crescent, I think they have their own group of the same security. I appreciate him and the immediate action they took. I'm sure it prevented the harassment of several more women that night. Thank you Crescent.",

It was only 10 bucks per person and no eat or drink minimum which was good since we'd already gotten dinner. Very surprised by the wide age groups of the people there, not sure if there grand-kids were performing or if they just liked alternative rock.  I almost never go to any sort of music venue so it was a fun experience, in all honestly I went to see Jim Adkins is some capacity but I don't know if I missed him cause we were got there around 8:15 or what.   Other people seemed to really be enjoying themselves and having a good time and we were too but I'm not into overtly loud sounds just for the sake of it being loud (we sit in the very back) but it was really loud (I could feel the vibrations in my chest at times) for an enclosed music venue with only like 100-125 people there. Gospal Claws was fun and I would have stayed longer to listen to their whole thing and maybe see Adkins but I decided an hour and a half was enough volume overload for my ears so we left. They were very nice and thanked us for coming as we left.   I'm sure people more accustomed to concerts and whatnot don't have a problem with the volume but I literally had no choice other than leaving or dealing with the sound since there was no way for us to physically go further back without leaving the music hall.",

This is especially important to me because it seems that the other venues either don't serve alcohol or they only have a small selection, most of which is garbage.  There is also a bar with multiple bartenders ~50 feet from the stage!  Atmosphere is very nice.  They did an excellent job planning the acoustics and the sound system.  The sound was fantastic.  Regarding the bathrooms, my wife actually approved, which is a first for her.  Another perk -- they have raised seating (benches?) along the back wall.

It provides an intimate setting to see music and it's easy to get up close to the band if that's your style. It is a bit of a \"hipster\" scene, but that makes the people-watching more fun. Also, the drinks are fairly priced. I'd like to go back for Trivia night and to try some food.",

The staff has always been really friendly and deliver the utmost in professional service. The layout includes all that you could want in the way of two bars, ballroom, restaurant, indoor/outdoor seating and the place has never given me so much as one reason to complain. Even the bathrooms are always in tip-top. What's more is that the place, as well as the performances booked there, attract a very interesting, eclectic and amiable group of people and I've met someone new and cool everytime I've been there. In short: *L*O*V*E* it!!!!!",

What I liked:  Great sight-lines from anywhere. The stage is a perfect size, height and shape. The room wraps around it. Good sound and lights. There were 10 people playing on stage and no difficulty fitting them on there! The bleacher concept is fab, and I like that some shows will have tables and chairs.  The bartenders, especially KC, were friendly and accommodating. I notice they don't have the pour limiters you see in a lot of bars these days. Kudos.  Front lounge is going to be a fantastic place to hang out even when there isn't a concert, and they're lining up some solid DJs. And food will come from Chris Bianco and Doug Robson? Yikes that's amazing.   I'm so looking forward to my first concert here. Woo-hoo for the Crescent Ballroom!",

We decided to bar hop a bit before heading to see Mason Jennings last night, and when we arrived at the Crescent Ballroom we were actually kinda pissed we didn't just hang out there before the show.  Here's what I liked about the place:  ~friendly staff ~nice outdoor patio ~reasonably priced drinks ~an audio feed into the restaurant/bar area... this was especially nice because we didn't have to miss anything to get drinks or go to the bathroom. ~plenty of seating and standing room to watch the show ~a second smaller stage outside the main stage (had a guy playing as the Mason Jennings show let out).  We didn't try any of the food but we're gonna try to get back here for another show as soon as we can!",

I was THRILLED that they had a Vanilla Bean rice pudding on the menu, so I ordered it!  The waitress was polite and brought me this big plastic bowl with a plastic spoon and it was FILLED with rice pudding!!! And it was only $3!!  It was DELISH!! My tastebuds soared!! I was sooo happy consuming this delight!  Anyway.... The 3 people at the table next to us were super friendly and we all chatted.  In fact, everyone at this place seemed super friendly and uber fun! The crowd was this beautiful eclectic mix of gay/lesbian, punk/rock/biker/techno peop's with lots of fun and cool hairstyles, make up and fashion.  We had a great time and I would highly recommend!",

It can get a little loud in the dining area, and it's almost always crowded when we go, so seating isn't always optimal.  However, the food and ambiance make up any shortcomings.  We go sometimes just for the guacamole - definitely some of the best I've ever had in my life.    I also love the seating inside the venue itself - it's comfortable and intimate.  I've seen a few of my favorite acts here and every time I always leave happy with the venue, the management, and the crowd.  It's a great location and I wish there were more venues like this.

    "text": "I used to pass by this area all the time on my bike and remember this whole corner pretty abandoned and quiet. Then during Art Detour when trying to find my lil bro's bike tour he was leading, we passed what I thought was still a sleepy corner to find Crescent Ballroom.   First impressions were great just riding by. Patio seating looked inviting and artwork hanging inside made me want to stop in, but not just yet, we had a bike ride to finish.   Luckily enough, my bro suggested we stop here after the ride for some drinks. Great idea. They had plenty of local brews on tap so I got my fav Four Peaks Kiltlifter and for a small snack we ordered the trail mix.   As predicted, patio seating was great! The lights on top of the building were set up to give the right about of lighting at night and our server did a great job of keeping us happy. The trail mix ($2.00) was awesome too, it came in a brown paper bag and did the job of holding us over till we ate later that evening.   Although this place makes a great bar, it looks like it would make an even better music venue. That will have to be for another night, but a band was setting up, and forewarned, you have to pay extra to sit in the room the band plays, but I'm sure that's part of how the band gets paid so I can't hate on that.   The Crescent Ballroom is a little off the beaten path for most visitors to downtown, so I imagine you'll see a lot of local downtowners which is great, and I hope to catch a show or grab some beers before a Suns game here again sometime.",

It's a great place to grab a drink, catch a show, dance your pants off, meet new people, and generally have a great time without the bougie atmosphere other areas of the valley may offer.  By all means, if you like whiskey and ginger beer - get yourself a HONEY BADGER. They're on happy hour and are generally delicious.  MAJOR PROPS to the CB for expanding their patio areas as well. Most businesses aren't as proactive with stuff like that and would rather just keep a line waiting outside. Last time I was there, the added space was much appreciated.",

Have you ever walked into a place confused where to go and eventually ask around for help? Yeah, this is one of those places.  Same thing happens if you eat-in, it's really unorganized. I had 3 separate people ask me, \"Hey, are you also waiting to be seated?\" or \"Do you know how we can order food?\". The last person who asked me got so tired of waiting for someone to help them, they eventually left.  Hire one lady to stay up front, seat people and take care of people with to go orders.

Great atmosphere & great music reminiscent of the good ole high school/college days :) Some friends went to their 90s R&B/Hiphop event a few months back & enjoyed it too so go check that out! I want to come back for a flamenco show. Anyways, my 5 stars has to do with the set-up of this place. (Note: I've been here once before for post-dinner dinner since the fattie in me got hungry again. Ate their chips/guac & Sonoran dog & it was good. Get it if you like dirtydogs).   As I was saying, the set-up is nice because the outdoor area allows you to enjoy the food while having an audible conversation, but if you're curious about the live band/DJ/show or want to just vibe with the music you can sneak inside and grab a drink by the bar. And perhaps you like what you're hearing and want to dance it off ... the dance floor is yours! Our cover charge was $5 at the door for guys/girls ($3 if purchased online), I'm not sure if that's always the case. I REALLY liked that they have these \"bleacher seats\" extended across the back wall so if you're tired from dancing or maybe you don't like to dance at all but just want to enjoy the music, you can just chill back there without having to  pay for a table or deal with all the inconveniences of a swanky club.  Big plus for all you ladies in heels who need to rest your poor little toes!  *Parking: Plenty of metered parking and lots.. use them! I thought we snagged a great non-metered spot for free on the side street, but it was a fail & I got a parking ticket for being too close to a fire hydrant :( So watch yourself!",

The venue was great for live music... and small so it was intimate so you could feel like you are getting an extra special experience. i also very much enjoyed the bar area. The bartenders were quick, friendly, the patrons were young and hip, but also friendly and happy to share a table at it's peak busy hours and the drinks were reasonably priced. $5 for a well cocktail on a Saturday night, while it's packed during a rad show? I'll take it! thanks for the good time, I'll be back!",

Tacos (go for the fish, tinga chicken or barbacoa) are 2 dollars each and come with fresh griddled corn tortillas. Can't go wrong with the bean dip either. The tacos are meaty - you'll be full with 2. It's especially nice now that the weather has turned towards fall and the patio is open. It's really one of the best lunches downtown.",

We got advance tickets for the bash - only $5 pp. Let's see what all went down between 9 PM and 1 AM: My new years eve meal = an $8.50 burrito that tasted fresh, with well cooked and well-seasoned meat; I was pleasantly surprised considering it came out of a big nondescript cooler; bartenders were nice and efficient; Drinks weren't outrageously expensive. Music was awesome, an eclectic mix of songs from the past three decades; there was an artist doing a painting live on stage while the DJ was blasting away - very cool to see; the crowd was late 20s-early-30s-hipsters-heavy; People cheered when some dude opened his umbrella in the middle of the crowd - gotta love the random hilarity. Dance floor was packed by 11 PM. It looked like the kind of dance floor for people who say \"I don't really dance\". To clarify, that's an observation, not a complaint. Nothing wrong with it.   Overall I'm glad we picked here for our one night in Phoenix/NYE outing.",

The set up is great, you walk in to a nice modern dining area where you can have pre-drinks and food before entering in to the actual venue.   The Ballroom itself is small, but well set up with stadium seating along the walls. The  under 21 area is also small and doesn't take away from the viewing pleasure of all the drunkards like some other places.   I have yet to try the food, but they do $5 beer and burritos on Fridays and I have heard rave reviews. This place rocks and I hope it stays this way. We need more venues like this in Phoenix!",

The shows are always great and 90% of the time the artist will hang out at the mech booth and take photos/sign things.   They give you free soda if your driving your friends that are drinking. Which I love! They support not drinking and driving. If its an all age show they rope all the under 21 in a small area. So you can sit in the stand (they have a area to sit! that doesn't ruin your view). I buy tickets to see any band that is just ok , because I know it will be a relaxing great time coming here.",

Alas, that is impossible because words don't really do it justice, but I'll still give it an attempt.  I have seen so many amazing shows at crescent and a lot of credit for these memorable experiences goes to the venue itself. There's not a bad seat in the house in the actual concert area. There's bleacher seating in the back if you're looking to chill and plenty of standing room if you're looking to dance like a maniac, spin around in circles, and jump till you drop.  Whenever somebody tells me that they haven't been to CB I immediately start gushing to them about the many great qualities about this place - music, people, food, atmosphere, ticketing, etc - and there are really very few places that I actively promote like I promote Crescent Ballroom.  At the end of the day, if you like music and/or cool bars and live anywhere in the Valley of the Sun, you have to give this place a try. Also, BEAN DIP!!!",

There is a paid parking lot just north of the restaurant and a parking garage across the street.  Atmosphere: Great super casual spot to grab a bite. Aside from the temporary maintenance it wasn't too loud. This restaurant also has shows at night, so obviously it will be louder.  Service: The waiter was excellent and constantly made sure I kept hydrated and that my order was correct and that my chip basket wasn't empty. As I left, I was thanked with a happy smile.  Taste: Food? Yeah, they serve food here! Some people only thought itnwas a place for entertainment, but yes they serve food. I ordered 4 street tacos (2 carne asada and 2 al pastor). Both were fantastic, though I prefer the al pastor slightly more because of the added flavor from the pineapples. The self-made tortillas were really good.   Pricing: Relatively cheap, with each taco costing around $3. This place gives discounts for tacos on Wednesdays not your usual Taco Tuesdays, so go on Wednesdays if you want cheaper tacos. With my 4 tacos, the total cost came to about $12  Verdict: I would recommend checking this place out. This is my 2nd time dining at this establishment. You can't go wrong with ordering any of their dishes. Only giving it a 4 star because of the lack of free parking. It would be great if there was some sort of parking validation.",

    "text": "I love this place on so many levels. First, the food.   Cocina 10 is not bar food - it's outstanding Mexican food that is very vegan friendly. The chips and salsa are some of the best in town. The salsa is not too spicy but full of flavor. I can't decide if I like the red or green better, so I tend to just eat too much of both. They really need to bottle it and sell it for home consumption! Sometimes when I get it to-go they give me big bowls of each, and I implode with happiness.   This isn't a \"throw a bunch of cheese on it and call it Mexican food\" kind of place. Instead, it offers thoughtful, inspired dishes that use fresh ingredients. My normal go-to is the Poquito bean burrito (serve with a Mr. Bean sticker), made vegan with no cheese and added rice. It's a simple burrito - nothing too fancy - but perfect. They grill it to crisp up the tortilla a bit. As a result, the tortilla is still soft, but nice and warm. It's served with chips so I can consume even more salsa. It's my favorite burrito in town. The veggie tacos and veggie burrito are also good options that are vegan by default. The guac side is also vegan, but if you get the guac appetizer it has cheese. I also really like their iced tea! Service is always just fine, and to-go orders have been handled with perfect. My only suggestion is that they not charge me for adding rice to the burrito since I'm leaving off the cheese, but that's a typical vegan problem (we're always overcharged for substituting less expensive ingredients). It's only 50 cents so it's not really an issue.  The concert venue is also outstanding. I'm past my mosh-pit prime, so having bleacher seating at the back is perfect for me (but I can still join the pit when compelled to do so). The stage is wide and elevated enough so that you can still see the band while standing in the back. The sound system at the Crescent is exceptional - for both loud rock shows and quieter acoustic shows. It's a great size for smaller touring bands or local shows. They also have decent air conditioning - which is important for summer shows in Phoenix! The only exception was the Jonathan Richman show a few years back, where he made them turn the air off because he didn't like the sound.   I really appreciate what the Crescent Ballroom has brought to downtown Phoenix - both from a music culture and dining perspective. Downtown has been a wasteland for smaller, indie concerts since I moved here 20 years ago, and Crescent spearheaded a revival for scene that has seen fits and starts over the years, turning the indie music scene into a sustainable venture. The addition of related smaller (Valley Bar) and larger (The Van Buren) venues has made downtown a place to see and be seen after the businesses close, the ball games end and the symphony goers have headed off for a night cap. It's leading the way to what downtown cultural centers should be - diverse, interesting and full of energy (and good food).",

    "text": "Ended up here bc of a long layover & airport bar recommendation. Stopped by around 6pm on a Friday for dinner & they had a live group of Mexican folksingers playing.   The place doubles as a restaurant/small venue, so it's a great place to meet cool ppl & head into the Phoenix night scene. Upfront there's the bar & restaurant w low key live performances & you can pay small cover to get to the to the DJ in the back.   The bar selection was ok, a few local brews, and standard priced house drinks. The Mexican food tho was STELLAR. I had the steak tacos and damn. Literally wasn't expecting it. Tortillas were authentic and the seasoned steak w the house salsa (MILD) on top. PERFECTION.   Definitely recommend for ppl looking for a low key night out, a nice chill dinner, or a start to a night out.",

Before the Josh Groban concert we ate at the Crescent Ballroom for Happy Hour after the dinner it was just in time to go to the concert which was at 8:00.   We had the Nachos, various street tacos which my favorite was the shrimp and a few Honey Badgers.  The food and drinks were well priced.  Now that the evenings are cooler we sat at their outside patio. And the service was Great!",

But  on concert nights it's pretty busy  and they never turn the air on so that sucks especially when in phx it's 120 degrees   If your gonna day you are a restaurant and are  family friendly for lunch. You must have high chair or something to that matter to accommodate a family there were at least  2 family today trying to eat and left because there was no seating safe for a child    At least one  other than that it's a great choice for lunch unless you have kids then leave them.

    "text": "Finally I went to this venue, I have no idea why it took so long. So let's speak to the venue itself. It pretty cool in there I actually like the indoor outdoor bar. The smokers probably are not fans there is one small corner where they may congregate and contaminate their lungs it's very compact area on the lower level outside. We went for a Halloween event but we decided to start with dinner so we got there early and glad we did. So Covina 10 has a less than a variety to offer however that being said we had 3 kinda of tacos, enchiladas, and bean dip. I particularly liked the Asada. The bean dip  do that.  All the food pairs well with beer. We had a cute sever very pleasant and professional named Becca. Now for the ballroom. It reminds me of a grade school gym. One side has a stage that when there is a DJ takes up way to much space it would be good if they could break it down to provide more space. The other side has some teared seating like the old school gym where people can sit and view the goings on, but why would you. The place gets full during events very full, but it's fun. It would be great if they could chill the dance floor once it gets packed cause it was hot in there and not in a good fun kinda way. Bathrooms are a bit dirty which I don't like but clubbers are gross so used to this. Food and drink prices are reasonable. However if you wanna get  drink better do it early cause once it gets busy getting a drink gets increasingly hard to accomplish. So should you go? Hell yes go and get close up with people and dance and laugh.",

It's also a Mexican restaurant so if your hungry you can come and take a bite and sit on the patio or inside. Now if you are there for a show, inside there's a stage and bleachers which are okay for watching a show but it's so small you can get a view from anywhere. There's also a bar and it can get a little hectic from waiters bringing food to the outside guests. All in all this place is trendy and fun for a night out!",

Upon entry, you walk through the main bar area where there are several tables for dining, and then you make your way into the actual concert hall. It's got a great ambience and of course, it's a smaller venue so any place you stand in that room is going to give you a great view. There are bleachers against the back wall should you want to hang back and just sit instead of gather by the stage. I've never had any issues with sound at this venue and they attract some great talent to play here regularly.   They always have something going on no matter what night you pick and just have an overall nice vibe at the place. If you want to catch a live show, I totally recommend this be a place you do it!",

    "text": "WARNING!!!  CONCERT PATRONS BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!!!!  THEY ARE DISHONEST AND UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!  I bought 2 tickets through for Todd Rundgren, which sold out, for this venue through Stubhub 5 days ago.  We arrived an hour early, showed our tickets, and had our small purses searched twice. We entered the ballroom and ordered a cocktail then were told that food had to be ordered back out in the lobby.  So we went back to the lobby area, found a table, ordered food, ate, then returned to the ballroom entrance, 6 feet from where our table was.  We were told that we had to have wrist bands in addition to our tickets that were supposed to be issued  to each of us outside where our purses were searched. Neither of us had been here before so just did as we were told.  We showed our tickets to everyone including an unprofessional, rude, manager named Michelle but were refused entrance.  They reviewed their security cameras and halfway through the concert offered a wristband as they obviously realized that they made a mistake.  By this time, our evening was ruined.  I will NEVER EVER go here again and will dissuade everyone I know from going to such a dishonest and unprofessional place.  Stubhub is aware that our tickets were legitimate and that is was the fault of Crescent Ballroom's manager.  Stubhub is willing to return all of my money plus send us to his concert in California on July 11.  Unfortunately I have to work so will not be able to attend.  I was so looking forward to hearing one of my favorite musicians from my childhood.  What a huge disappointment!!! So sad.",

It made me a little embarrassed I had talked the place up!  The front door staff seemed confused on how to charge our credit card.  A manager told my friends smoking on the patio before 9:30 was not allowed.  We left the patio and I watch 5 people smoke there and the guy said nothing to them.  When we came back to the patio, my husband reached over the side to grab his drink when we were obviously on our way BACK onto the patio and the same guy who was picking and choosing who got to smoke yelled at my husband for drinking off the patio.  It hadn't even been taken off the patio or drunk yet!  I'm not trashy, I'm not an idiot, and I don't like being nit picked every 2 seconds when I'm out.  If I have to follow the rules, everyone else should too.  Maybe I didn't wear enough hipster chic that night?  Beer selection is ok.  Food was ok.  Indoor venue gets 4 stars.

Our waitress had zero personality, was unfriendly and even managed to charge our credit card to the wrong bill. We couldn't figure out if she was half asleep or purposely trying to mess with us. I mean, who delivers drinks by holding each glass by the rim?  After spending nearly 2 hours and plenty of money in this place we're ready to walk into the concert. They tell us we need wristbands first. No problem, we walk to the front door to get our wristbands, the girl tells us we need to go outside and wait in line, everybody needs to show id to get in. We all had brand new drinks, so I ask if we are allowed to take our drinks with us to go outside, they say no drinks have to stay inside. The whole purpose of the wristbands was to show who was over 21, which we are and we are now holding beers so obviously we are over 21. I get the manager, she also wants us to go wait in line outside and leave our drinks inside (so somebody can spike them?). After arguing we finally get the wristbands; which in hindsight probably should have been given to us with our check since we had our tickets on the table the whole time and even showed them to the waitress.  The concert was great though, I would go see Xavier Rudd anywhere. Also the food itself was good and the bartenders on the inside of the concert area were friendly.",

I plan on going back to try the food at some point. The interior is very nicely decorated, the stage is more spacious than most stages at similar venues, and they actually believe in leaving the air conditioning on when a band is playing! Trust me, it was much appreciated. I plan on being back, and soon!",

It was a 21 and older show and the lines at the bar moved along really well. Sound level was reasonable and appropriate for the space. We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "came here for dinner and a free show last Sunday. we unknowingly arrived in the middle of their trivia night. as far as trivia questions go - these were hard! I play bar trivia occasionally and I usually know at least a few answers. I don't think I knew a single question they asked here! and I thought it was weird that they ask ALL the questions and don't even tell you the answers until the very end. if I had been playing I would've gone crazy with frustration wanting to know what the correct answer was! it seems like the people participating were enjoying themselves though. I believe the prizes for winning trivia are a $25 gift certificate or two tickets to a show.  the food: nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either. I ordered the quesadilla, to which I added steak. they shouldn't really call it \"steak\" because it was shredded beef. only other ingredient inside the quesadilla was a lot of cheese. it came with a side of chips and salsa and a huge scoop of sour cream. I might come here for food again, but it's nothing notably delicious.  the show: their stage/venue is really awesome with the seated bleachers in the back and standing room in the front. I love how intimate and small the stage is. we saw three local bands perform for free; they were all very different musically but I enjoyed them all. if a band I liked was playing I would definitely come back to catch them play!",

    "text": "I have been to this then-new-ish very dark venue a few times since '13 to support local bands or larger bands who have come to Phoenix.  I have never eaten here and I will just review the first 2 shows to begin with during my visits... I first came here in November 2013 when the 1st-generation Los Angeles band, X, came to town to perform their punk music hits they released since the 1970s, with fellow punkers, The Blasters, as their opening act.  The following year, I came back to watch the 3 local bands on one night: Cherie Cherie, Man Hands, and French Girls.  Every one of them all gave a solid True professional performance each.  I believe, again, the way a venue treats a band influences the bands' level of conducts when performing a gig.  The ticket prices were fair.  The shows started on time (thanks for not being too loud).  The staff was professional and organized.  Security was there (for 'X') but not that sorely needed (there was this one guy who kept trying to get people to move a bit out of the way, as if he's worried about fire exits- one attendee did get a bit mad at him for repeatedly touching him to move.  Putting down a rope like in a movie theater might've avoided this hassle).  I am impressed that everyone was well-behaved and got along(!)  This makes my evenings leaving me feeling pleasant and relaxed- which is why I go out, to have a nice time away from the everyday antics (wink).  The bleachers were a cool idea (my preference, too, instead of on the floor/pit for my safety's sake), and I stood on it to take great photos, as well as so I could see the performers more.  They usually leave tables / chairs for small acts, but for the larger ones, you only have the bleachers if you want to sit, and of course, if you sat down, it is very unlikely you would view the stage since attendees on the pit are standing (and dancing and cheering). I especially appreciate that upon entering the eatery/venue, that it smelled good- either food or 'sweet' like liqueur and not dirty or old.  A bonus is no smoking is permitted.  I do not drink either so I bring in my own water bottle.  I also appreciate that we're not being searched upon entry like the bigger venues- it's like visiting a club owned by a family or relative.  My paternal grandparents owned an Italian bar & restaurant, so it almost felt like the venue used to belong to them before they retired and sold to Crescent.  And, the fact that Crescent is located downtown and near the light rail stop is convenient for most. I still return when I get invited, and I hope I continue getting A+ treatment each time (wink again).  Maybe I'll even sample the food.  Thanks for the good times Crescent and band members (thanks for enabling me to take great photos and also for the sample CD(French Girls)).  See you again soon...",

It's a very intimate place, where even from the seating (stadium bleachers, for reals) you are still very much \"there\".  Pricing, including fees, are very reasonable.  I've rarely paid over $20 for a show, and one at that price even included the artist's new album (thanks, Donovan Frankenreiter!)  The food looks and smells delicious, though I've never ordered any yet. Plenty of lunch specials are advertised via Facebook.  Yes, I am a Facebook fan as well!    I appreciate the help-yourself water and cups, so that the wait for drinks at the bar is not held up by a request for 10 waters. Mixed drinks (vodka press, at least) are an extremely reasonable $4 or $5.  Crazy cheap for a music venue. Beer selection is well-thought out as well.  Bathrooms are always clean and well-stocked...even at the end of the night.  Practically a miracle.  Staff is super friendly. Seriously.  This place has no flaws!  Parking is always an easy $5 cash payment at the lot across the street.  Easily accessible to the PHX Light Rail as well, but I've only gone that route once.  I notice most other reviews have lots of hipster references.  Can't say that I notice a huge influx of hipsters here versus other similarly sized music venues.  Could that mean that...I am.. *gasp*..a hipster myself?  Uhhh...I say nah...only because I don't own enough hats or mustache-inspired clothing/accessories to quality.  Yet.",

Ordering two single tacos is just the right amount of food and are tasty, though the pork was a bit tough.  Others in our group liked the burgers and the burrito.  Fudge with chocolate sauce was a hit for our person celebrating a birthday.",

I'm not sure if there were hooks on tables or the bar rail, if so great, but if not, it would be nice because I had no where to put my purse. I had it sitting on the bar rail and it made me really nervous when a gentleman that was mumbling to himself came walking by.   I really liked the salsa and how they served it in squeeze bottles. I had the Pacific Chicken Burrito and I thought it was quite tasty and fresh. My daughter had a bean burrito and it looked very fresh. My husband had the Barbacoa bowl and he said it was good. We only had water to drink, because we were on our way to a musical and didn't want to be tired. But their drink menu looked promising for our return visit.   The prices just blew me away! I couldn't believe the chips and salsa were a dollar (happy hour) and my burrito was under nine dollars. Our entire meal including tip was $25.00. That's pretty unbelievable for an app, and three meals.   I should also mention that everyone we came in contact with was so nice! No pretentiousness to be found, and you've really gotta love a place like that, especially when you're a little older and you think a place only caters to the young and hip.   Can't wait to come back with just hubby or girlfriends and catch a show.",

Most of the shows I've gone to in the past year have been either here or at the Marquee. Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! Compare the friendly staff to the surly workers at the Marquee. The wonderful temperature control versus the sweltering heat. The clean, plentiful bathrooms instead of cesspool restrooms. And what about the free water stations, great cocktails, stadium seats, and a damn tasty veggie burro big enough for two?  All of these great elements make Crescent Ballroom a shining star in Cen Pho. In a town where venue after venue is shutting down, I couldn't be happier that this place is thriving.",

I have been saving up all these wonderful things to say in a review about Crescent Ballroom but, if I wait any longer I will never write it...  Every show, every experience at the bar, every encounter with the staff, it all just gets better all the time. Something in the water perhaps?   This venue is the tits! The show room is so intimate. You can get up close and personal with your favourite artists or chill back in the stadium bleachers There's not a bad spot to stop and listen in the whole place. The sound, the lights, the temperature! Its all oddly perfect. You are never really standing on top of someone else and I really love that. But some sold out shows do get packed.  Los Dias de la Crescent was such a stand out event for me this past year. Really a unique experience at a venue other than a park.   They have a good beer selection! Though they don't have Hop Knot on tap I can order it in a can or, in lieu, grab an Odells on draft.   I have not had a chance to order food from the cocina but I have tried the nachos and they do not disappoint!  I try to see at least two shows a month here. No reason not to! So many great artist and at such an intimate venue. Stop over at Stinkweeds, pick up some tickets and get your bottom to a show!",

They could use more umbrellas on their tables, but we were able to grab some shade.   The service was a bit slow, but the food was fantastic.  I especially enjoyed the guacamole.  It was a huge portion, unlike some places.  My coworker got the carne asada tacos and I got the chicken tinga torta.  Both of us really enjoyed the food.   I will definitely come back here for lunch when I'm working downtown.",

    "text": "One of the better places to see a show. Will say it's the first place I've been to where brews are 6 bucks which isn't bad at all. Unlike the other places I've raged in reviews over their gouging. Since this place is more a pub and restaurant food is also reasonable and not a bad idea to come early to get your fill.   The only area I take real main beef with this place is the tickets office or what that call one going in. Getting em online was easy but this website does not put barcodes on online ticket. Which is fine cause I will say this place is swift once u show em your purchase. However on my night of cracker they were not going to make this so easy. You see the doors to the concert room where through a narrow path splitting the pub in a third and by the door a podium for checking this ticket is next to that door. Ok wierd but ok. The issue here is no was ready behind that podium until 15 min til showtime and on a 110 degree day not cool. Sure you can go inside and order a brew but may not get to sit there and go outside under the misters. That's ok but when your that close so showtime things gotta start popping!!! Also going through the middle of the restaurant to get into the show seemed to disrupt inside customers and a band they had in the pub. Might help for some guard ropes before showtime to ease congestion. Will say too that security was friendly helpful and did their job as well maintaining things inside the show.  Now the setup of the stage was nice is was definitely a wide stage in a room that had benches with free seating on bottom and paid on top. In front was a good sized pit as well and the acoustics here are definitely good.  Overall I do like this place. Despite some of its rectifiable shortcomings this is probably one of the best venues especially if you are like me and like more intimate settings with bands.",

It's small & intimate, you always have a pretty solid view of the stage.  The food is delicious-- get here early to enjoy some tacos.  The green sauce is everything.  Always an interesting mix of humans.  Hipster galore.  The drinks are pretty solid too.  The honey badger is a great choice and I love the IPAs they have on draft.  The last time I was here, I was dying from heat exhaustion but I feel like they've really upped their A/C game.  Much appreciated.  All in all, a great spot.",

Very cute venue (front half where you eat) and the waitress working was running her tail off. I got a drink (Honey Badger) and it's honestly now one of my favorite drinks to date. They don't have straws for your drink, which I think is a great environmentally conscious decision. Food was great (veggie taco & Pacifica taco - Rice & beans). If you order chips and salsa, you get two types of salsa - & a separate dish to put them on. Music venue (second room) is great as well - with a bar in there also. Cozy lighting, but a great sound system & lights for the live bands. Additionally love that they have all types of music playing, so you can experience an array of genres. Definitely can't wait to go back.",

Later there was a rave with some DJs and then a live violinist which was beautiful to hear, a DJ amplified the sound of the violin.   Now EDM music is not my thing (other than the violinist which was a small piece of it), I came for the costume ball and the salsa music so during the rave I was pleasantly surprised to find wooden bleachers to sit on which gave ample room for those that wanted to sit, or take a break from it all.  The decor was lovely, some of it was Halloween related, other parts were Dia de los Muertes related.   The food on the other hand was not that good, especially for the price. I had the barbacoa burrito which was just beef, refried beans, and onions. I wish there was more in it like other vegetables, sour cream, and cheese. I asked for some sour cream but wasn't told I'd be charged extra for it, and I was. I would suggest to just get guacamole or their nachos, people were commenting that those were good.",

    "text": "It's pretty dang hard to find a concert venue that also has fantastic food and drinks that don't break the bank. Crescent is the best of both worlds for sure.   As a tiny lady who loves live music, I thoroughly appreciate any venue in which I can see the stage from anywhere in the room. I don't know how they do it, but I am very supportive of whatever Black Magic they employed to make it happen. A small intimate venue with shockingly good acoustics for its size, Crescent may just be my favorite in the Phoenix area.   Pro tip: if you have a ticket to any show at CB or the Van Buren, you can get 15% off your food/drink bill! Make sure you print it out though! Some of the best Tex Mex in the valley, I adore Cocina 10 and everything is super reasonably priced. My go-to is the bean and cheese burrito (boring, right? WRONG. THE WRONGEST. The bean and cheese burrito will change your life, especially doused in green salsa). Seriously, I usually find b&c boring, but again with the black magic, it's perfect here. I like to get chips and salsa to scoop some of the beanycheesy goodness out so then it's almost like you also have bean dip. Double meal, hell yeah! Also every single one of their tacos is fab. Really, I've never been disappointed by anything here.  They have a great happy hour that I frequent, so don't be alarmed if you show up to find me diving into a b&c with beans smeared all over my face. Or maybe do.",

    "text": "A few years back, I found a cool band I liked on Spotify (Mandolin Orange.....random playlist, heard a cool song by them and then started checking out their other work).  I saw that they were coming to The Crescent Ballroom, so I purchased a pair of tickets for my buddy and I.    We drove down and parked about a block down (meter lot, 25 cents every 15 minutes...cost us only 2 bucks) and walked down to the entrance.  A bunch of people were eating/drinking out front.  We got our ticket scanned and went inside.  Loved the layout of the place!   They have bleachers on your left, and then SRO for the rest of the area.  One bar, a merchandise area, and restrooms near the back.  Even though the show was \"sold out\", there was still plenty of room to chill and not be right on top of everyone.  We hung out to the left of the stage, kind of near the bar.  Speaking of the bar...........  they have plastic cups (big ones) and free, ice cold water.  Self serve, too!  Loved that aspect of this place!  You don't have to ask the bartender or anything.  I really thought that was a cool touch.  There was an opening band of 2 guys on acoustic guitars....forgot their name!  They played about 6 or 7 songs which were enjoyable.  Mandolin Orange came on about 9pm.  They were AWESOME!  Such good musicians.  A lot of their songs are slower, love/heartbreak type songs, which personally I find boring, but their more upbeat songs are very harmonious and make you feel great.  Acoustics in the place were awesome.  Not too loud, could understand and hear every single lyric that was being sung.  They played for about an hour and 15 minutes, and then came back for an encore.  If you have never listened to them, check them out.  They rock!    I loved this venue!  If any other bands I'm interested in come by here, I am definitely going to check them out.  Had a great time!",

    "text": "Another great venue for a smaller capacity show(holds 550) . Didn't eat or drink but was told the food is fantastic. Next time I'll have to try the food . Decent sized stage . I found the sound to be good however some pointed out the sound became less muddy when not being right near the stage. I still thought it sounded good .   There is the traditional SRO area plus bleachers in the back to sit . Merchandise is over in the far corner near the bathrooms . Bathrooms were clean . There was this one space that was barricaded for under 21 patrons. It looked kind of funny, like they were herding cattle . Liabilities I guess .   Staff were all cool , no drama . Parking- I parked behind the venue where the bands load in . Plenty of parking around the venue.",

The patio is great for hanging out and enjoying the weather, although it can get crowded.  Nice and intimate place to hear live music.  Not too big.  Great beer on tap and in cans and bottles.

    "text": "If I didn't live so far away, Crescent would probably be my regular hangout for just about anything - eating, drinking, live music, whatever.  Sure, it's pretty hipsteriffic - but that's to be expected. The venue caters largely to local and indie music, but it's nothing like several other cheap, run-down shack \"venues\" in the valley (cough). It's new, clean, and fairly organized; a little small, but I prefer it that way, because I hate being in huge crowds at shows. I haven't heard of half the bands who come here, because I'm not that cool, but they'll have a bigger act once in a while, and the concerts I HAVE seen here are fantastic. Great sound, great views, and great atmosphere.  What has bothered me, unfortunately, is the service at the bar and patio. Both times I've been here and ordered food and drinks, I've been pretty frustrated with how inattentive the servers are. Yes, we get it, you're busy - but I've worked in the restaurant biz, and all I can say is that if you can't handle it, don't be a server. Being busy is not a good excuse to forget to bring items, make us wait 15 minutes for checks after asking, and then screw up said checks. Something along these lines has happened on each visit. Might just be bad luck. I'd really love to come here sometime when it's not packed before a show, because the food and drinks are surprisingly good. It looks like they have some great specials throughout the week, too.  But negatives aside, Crescent is fun, reasonably priced, and refreshingly different. I like the set-up (the venue being separate from the dining area/bar/patio, plus both standing and sitting areas for shows) and the relaxed environment. Overall it's a chill place to hear some good tunes and hang out with friends. It's like a breath of fresh air amongst a sea of dark, dingy, overpriced venues in the Phoenix area.",

The lineup has been phenomenal and non-stop so far and the location is great. I plan on seeing Phantogram as my third show there so far.  I must also establish, though, that being under 21 at this venue absolutely sucks. First, you're sent to a back entrance after you get your ticket validated at the front entrance where you see people eating great food and having a great time outside. Upon entering through the back, you have three choices: go straight into the Kiddie Corral that makes up 1/4 of the whole crowd area, hang out in the dark bathroom, or check out the merch table. When I saw St. Vincent at Crescent Ballroom, I literally stood in the same spot for 30 minutes just so I could get a decent view of Annie. I couldn't move because it was so crowded and if I did move, the only view I would be able to get would've been the back of the drummer's head. Also, where I was standing, the sound was really distorted since the speakers were right above and in front of us. Everyone was wincing and plugging one of their ears to bear it; It was way too loud at least in that instance. I saw Unknown Mortal Orchestra there a few weeks prior, though, and that sounded pretty great...but the crowd was a lot smaller and thus I wasn't stuck directly in the speaker's line of fire.  I asked the two security guards at the back entrance 1. What do I do if I want something to drink other than water? and 2. What do I do if I want to get something to eat? To both questions, they answered, \"Just flag one of us security guards down, we'll take care of you.\" What, so I'm going to tell you I want something, you're going to leave your post to get me a menu, wait for me to choose, give my order to the kitchen, and then bring my food to me so I can eat it standing up in the corner of the Kiddie Corral? I don't think that's very logical, personally.  I just don't understand the logic of the whole map of the place. If you're 21, I would imagine it's a fantastic experience, but I wouldn't know since I'm 18 and not allowed to see more than the upper left corner of the building. Oh, and there's no re-entry even though you're stamped and usually braceleted! It's almost unbearable when the whole place is unceasingly loud and dark and stuffed with people and there is only a corner of available space to merely move in. I pay a good amount to get in to this nice local venue, I would expect to simply be able to get back in if I want to get a breath of fresh air.",

    "text": "Went to crescent ballroom a few months ago and haven't been back. Here's why:  My boyfriend and I are both East Coast transplants. We had been to old town and were in search of a spot a little less...plastic?   We found that at Crescent Ballroom. We liked that it was laid-back, has live music and cold beer.   We posted up at a table and asked for a server. The kind lady said that we would have to get our drinks from the bar. So we started a tab and had a couple beers while watching Dylan Pratt. He was really fantastic and I would love to see him again. We ordered some nachos and continued to watch the show. Nachos never showed so we assumed she forgot to order them for us. No biggy. We were ready to leave and asked for the tab.   Upon seeing the nachos still listed on the bill, I reminded her that we never actually had them. It's 3 or 4 bucks so whatever, right? But I don't make it a habit of paying for something I ordered but never received. The server/bartender/non-food deliverer says,\"I told you that you would have to come to the bar for your drinks and food.\"  Me-\"I understand. But couldn't you have tapped on my shoulder to say that the food was up?\"   She refused to take the nachos of the bill. Girlfriend wants to play hardball. That's cool too. I asked to speak the manager. The manager says, \"Didn't you understand that you would have to get your food from the bar?\" And...then...I lost it.   Me-\"Are you kidding? Yes, but I find it a little ridiculous that our food sat up on the bar while we were watching the show and no one could let us know it was ready? Or just drop it off to us. Aren't you the manager? Isn't it your job to make sure things like that don't happen?\"  Manager-\"Let's step outside and talk about this. You are disturbing the other customers.\"  So funny. Haha, I felt literally felt like Ben Stiller in the \"bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb!\" scene of Meet the Parents. Only I wasn't dealing with a chirpy flight attendant. It was worse...I was dealing with a hipster. I get it. You are cooler than me in many ways. You're not wearing a bra and you read more books and watch more indie movies than I do. But I'm your customer, a first time customer who decided to spend my hard earned money and my valued personal time at your establishment. Have some respect for that. Take the $3 hit and let me leave your restaurant wanting to return.   After spending 9 years in the restaurant industry, I know when to tell a customer \"Sorry for the inconvenience, let me take it off your tab.\"  I tip 20% or more on good service. Even if my food sucks. I don't tip 20% on lazy or pretentious service.",

As a pretty regular visitor to all types of live music events, I think that I have a new favorite place to see a live show. Pretty much everything said by previous reviewers was True. The sound is top notch. The staff is customer-friendly at a level that I find perfect. Everyone I came in contact with was friendly and laid-back. Not over-the-top phony friendly and definitely  not a \"billy bad-ass\" attitude to be found anywhere (hear that Club Red?) The bar prices are very reasonable and even at a sold-out show the wait at the bar was never more than a minute.  For a bar with live music, the whole place is extremely clean. Even the restrooms are in good shape. It doesn't even have that old spilled beer smell.  Didn't try any of the food so can't comment on that.  Highly recommend for live music.",

Those venues are long gone and I've seen many shows since then at large venues or small venues that just didn't have it right... Those small venues being bars or clubs that moved some tables or have a stage but a terrible sound system.  The Crescent Ballroom is everything I want from a small music venue. There is sufficient patio seating for the smokers to have their breaks.  There is also a large main bar area with seating for those dining.  This area is awesome and always open to everyone who just want to hang out downtown where delicious vodka and tasty nachos are served.   You can then enter the large space where the concerts are held.  There is plenty of standing room and plenty of stair seating (think high school gym bleachers).  There is a large bar in that area so you don't have to leave the music to get a drink.  I recommend finding a spot in the standing area in the middle.  Find those speakers and stand below them.  They have an amazing sound system where you hear and feel the music.   I hear they always have some musician playing either in the small or large area of the property.  It's great to have live music as an option every day of the week.",

    "text": "I want SO badly to give Crescent Ballroom a 5-star review, because really it is nearly a 5-star place.  First off, the concert venue is perfect for Phoenix.  It is small enough to be extremely intimate, yet large enough that you don't feel cramped and can step away almost enough to have a conversation while the music is loud.  Drinks are reasonably priced, and there are 2 bars that generally don't have a huge wait.  Did you say you could buy a burrito to eat during the concert? Heck yes!  The sound quality and lighting are both pretty good, and they bring in great local acts.  I think they have a concert nearly every night of the week, and tickets are rarely expensive.  Second, the lounge area is pretty awesome.  There is never a cover to get in, and you can generally hear the concerts from there as well.  Most nights there is a DJ that plays some pretty sweet music, and people seem to always be happy.  There are a number of high-tops and tables if you want to chill, and by midnight people tend to create a little dance floor.  I don't have much experience with the food here, but the burrito I had was pretty good and I've heard good things.  Check that out for yourself.  So, why only 3 stars?  The big reason is the smoking.  Crescent has a sizable patio area in the front of the building, and it draws quite the hipster crowd.  I love hipsters.  But I hate hate hate how much they smoke.  Every single person on the patio is smoking at all times.  The problem here?  The patio has giant doors that open the lounge up to the outside, and the hipsters are essentially smoking inside.  Not in 2012, not in my book.  It kills me.  Reason number two for the star-deduction: what is wrong with the grapefruit juice here?  I've been told by every bartender that it's fresh-squeezed, and I have no reason to doubt that.  But seriously, there is something major wrong with it.  I've tried it with all of my favorite vodkas, and it just fails each time.  So, here's what you do.  Drop by one night, they're open until 2am every night.  Check out a concert if you can, for $10 who really cares if you know them or not.  Grab a drink at the bar and stay as far from the patio as you can.  And grab an Odell IPA, they never disappoint.",

The venue is good ( Ive only attended one show and it was outside). The drinks are pretty amazing- they are strong! Selection on tap could be better, but they make up for it in other canned beers and liquors. If you're trying to have a relaxing beverage after work, make sure you leave before the crowd because it will get packed and LOUD. The bartenders are pretty cool, I have to say that the majority of the women bartenders are somewhat snobby... but they probably deal with a lot of BS from guys hitting on them. But this bar has become my cheers bar! They also give away tix on Thurs (used to be Tues) during lunch. But get there early and ASK- don't assume they will offer them to you (learned this the hard way after loosing the opportunity for some prime tickets I specifically went for and they were gone).",

    "text": "The wife and I were staying in Phoenix for the Vikings/Cardinals game this week and were looking for something to do after a disappointing Viking's loss.  How lucky was I that the Roadway Inn was two blocks away from this little secret gem?  We got a little appetizer type sampling of food with some amazing guacamole and a super good bean and cheese burrito.  I was also a huge fan of the Coronado Water (tequila, agave nectar, grapefruit bitters, and soda water).  It was very refreshing and tasty.    The relaxed vibe at this place was also just what we were looking for.  Good music being played, friendly staff, and some old skate videos on the tv's. They also have live music many nights a week.  I was surprised to see Finch was playing there soon.  It would be a cool place to see bands because it is pretty small and intimate.  A must visit if in the Phoenix area.",

    "text": "Crescent Ballroom has been one of my favorite downtown Phoenix locations since I first moved to AZ nearly three years ago. In the time between then and now, I have been to Crescent Ballroom for tons of music shows and even a literary function (Spillers)!  FOOD / DRINK  For all the times I've visited, I have YET to try the food. How screwed up is that!? I'll have to change that here sometime soon... I have, however, partaken of the bar menu, which is wonderfully diverse. I'm a single malt scotch guy, so seeing multiple scotch options at a venue bar gets me excited. The beer list is also pleasingly varied.  VENUE  But enough about food/drink. What about the venue? As a venue, Crescent Ballroom holds my #1 favorite spot. They host such a wide range of bands and seem to have a really good eye for new \"indie\" music that's trendy and relevant.  SOUND  Sound is the biggest factor for whether or not I can enjoy my time at a music venue. Having been a musician myself, I know all that goes into a solid audio mix. I am VERY pleased to report that Crescent Ballroom has consistently featured the most professional sound engineering. I'm super picky about this, so being able to depend on them for a good mix means a lot! I'm quite certain the bands who play here feel the same.  BALLROOM  The ballroom features plenty of standing room, a bar all its own, bleachers (!), and typically multiple water dispensers at various locations within the ballroom so you don't have to wait for ages at the bar just to \"order\" a cup of water when you're parched from drinking/singing/screaming.  PARKING  Even parking isn't that big of a deal at Crescent Ballroom because they have a decent-sized lot of their own in addition to plenty of street parking within easy walking distance.  CONCLUSION  To this day, I can't say I've had a single bad experience at Crescent Ballroom. If you haven't been, I recommend that you keep an eye on their music calendar and find an excuse to catch a concert. If you'd rather not wait, then go enjoy a dinner on the patio! You're likely to be surprised by a small performance of some kind and, even if you're not, I'm sure you'll agree that the atmosphere and service alone are reason enough to consider the trip worthwhile.  Thank you, Crescent Ballroom team, for working so hard to provide an enjoyable experience. You've been great. Can't wait to see you again really soon!",

    "text": "We came here to see The Soft Moon and to eat tacos! The tacos were pretty dang good. They were fresh and served very quickly. Out of the selection we had the pork (al pastor), tinga chicken and fish tacos. Their beer selection if above average. Only complaint is they serve their drinks in plastic cups. This imparts a weird taste, in my humble opinion.  The staff we encountered were all very nice and accommodating. The venue itself is intimate, but the sound system was good and didn't distort the sound. For $10 to see a national act + two opening acts (which I was assuming were local kids) it was a good value. I really wish we had something like this in SW Colorado. I would not hesitate to make the 7.5 hour drive to this venue again.",

He is a music fan first and ... well ... that's just what he is ... a music fan not a natural businessman.   The place is just beautiful (for now, soon to be broken with the wear and tear of rock and roll no doubt). The room is small ... stage big (for the size) ... no doubt this is going to be the best place in the city to see any band for a long time to come!  Thank you Charlie!  Music fans unite! This place MUST thrive!  btw ... they have live music every single night of the week ... and they open at 4pm every day (the lounge will have musicians and DJs for your entertainment).",

    "text": "The Wife took me here for a Date Night to see her band ZZ Ward and have a few drinks. We both really enjoyed the ease and simplicity of the whole experience. Parking is right out back for around $5. Tickets for the show were $15 each and both the drinks and food were very affordable and tasty.  Inside has a small lounge up front where you can enjoy some good eats and drinks. You can even hear the bands playing in certain areas without getting a ticket. There is also a small patio that you can use if you need to light one up or just get some fresh air.  The bands are in the middle section and it is a rather large area. Most of the people listening are standing up by the stage and you can move around wherever you want to go. There are also some bleachers along the wall if want to listen sitting down. Really like the cool bar area in the back when you need a quick refill and the easy access bathrooms when it is time to go. Nice!  This particular show was sold out and packed to the rim. Even with a full crowd it was still a very enjoyable event. The sound is pretty amazing no matter where you listen. It does have a tendency to get pretty loud at times so you may want to bring some ear plugs as an option.  Get there early so you can goof off and work on your buzz. The music can go for a few hours depending on the length of the sets and who is playing. We both ordered the giant Lalo Guerrrero Burger to soak up some suds before the main act and it was delicious.  Don't tell the wife but I thought ZZ Ward was really CUTE and could easily be my new Yelp Current Crush. Definitely will be back for another show soon. Check online for tickets and schedules. COOL MAN!  4.5 STARS",

Crescent is the spot for shows too big for a cramped little shack like Trunk Space, but too small for one of those uncontrollable, rowdy venues like Marquee.   I came here early for a Cold War Kids show and hit the bar. If anyone has ever done some drinking at a concert, you'll appreciate prices here. $5 for a 12 oz craft beer is more than fair, I've paid tons more for a Bud freaking Light elsewhere. I indulged in the $2 \"Mystery Shot\". No regrets, I think it ended up being some sweet, flavored vodka. Just note that even *after* taking it, the bartenders are still in the dark about what it is. Just prepare for something different in case it's something crazy like pepper SoCo!  Anyways, the sound is top notch, it attracts a good crowd, and I have zero complaints whatsoever about my experience. You hear that, Crescent? You're PERFECT. Don't. Change. Anything.",

There is ample seating both in the lounge and music venue area, and there really is no bad seat in the house.  The scene is very diverse but leans more towards the hipster side; however this all depends on who is playing.   The audio quality is above average in the music venue area, and the small setting makes for a very intimate show.  Highly suggest this place and I hope it is here for as long as I am!",

Exposed brick, an old piano, large windows, metal tables and dim lighting provide for an enjoyable bar experience.  There are large doors that separate the venue side from the bar area.  Their strawberry cocktail (Rest Stop)  is one of my favorites drinks ever - its the right amount of flavor and alcohol without the over abundance of sugar, like most strawberry cocktails have.   The Mexican food here can hold its own and is way more than just \"bar food!\"",

I got a \"well fine.. we will honor it this time, but only on one drink. you can't use that here again, we don't approve those coupons\" I felt like a criminal. Just posting a sign about coupons would be a good idea -The way the bar is set up with a crooked line to order a drink, you got to just grab the bartenders attention.

The music is good, the atmosphere is good, burritos are good, the chips are less than medium, the drinks and churros are really awesome, but I just keep getting served by the meanest waitress in the industry.  I politely told her that she charged us twice for a single PBR. She hates to hear this. She ripped the bills out of our hands, threw them down on the table next to us and yelled at us (there was a clear and definite raising of the voice) that she slipped the whole bill in with one person's individual bill as well. This lady really needs to lose the 'tude.   But the joke's on me, because I'll be back. I guess I don't care if you yell at me, just as long as you keep feeding me churros and whiskey drinks.",

I bring people who don't ordinarily hang out Downtown to Crescent and they're blown away by the \"cool factor.\" Charlie Levy did an amazing job creating the space and assembled a world-class staff.  If you're a first-timer make sure you try the Honey Badger (honey bourbon, ginger beer, lime, bitters), already the bar's star, and order a massive plate of nachos from the Cocina 10 kitchen. Crescent also has a nice selection of beers on tap that they rotate, including O'Dell IPA.",

Thank you Crescent Ballroom.  You saved the day.  Now I don't have to watch Phish in 120 degrees, turning into human bacon, paying too much for a foamy beer that is going to turn into pee water in two minutes.  Oh, and I don't even like the band anyway... because they always play in dusty-outdoor-half-empty amphitheaters with awful sound caused by rattling sheet metal and airplane noise pollution.  So, when a friend asks me,   \"Dude, you want to spend 120 bones to see String Cheese Incident at Mesa Ampitheater?\"     I am going to politely say no and go see Big Freedia from a dark corner in a cool ballroom and drink my delicious whisky and coke that only costs 5 bucks.    This venue is great for the music industry, it's great for the penny pinchers, it's great for the socialites, and it's great for Phoenix.  Charlie Sheen can't win this much with three nostrils.",

I recently attended a local music concert at Crescent and had a blast! What a cool venue. Perfect for local bands about to hit it big, mid-level national acts traveling through town or even a national act hoping to play a smaller gig. With the bleacher seating in the back of the room there was plenty of seating for those who didn't want to stand (or feet were too tired from dancing already). The sound was great, and although I had to yell at a friend while trying to have a conversation during one of the acts, I still could at least talk to her.   The beer selection was great and prices were moderate- it's about what I would expect to pay for a microbrew on a night out.   Crescent Ballroom is easily accessible- off 2nd Ave & Van Buren. Street parking is easy to find on surrounding streets.  When the show was over, I was a little dismayed to see the hipsters had overtaken the front lounge as I suddenly felt out of place (my jeans weren't tight enough), but everyone seemed to be having fun and it wasn't overly crowded. I'm really looking forward to going back!",

For us the great staple is the Flamenco music and dance performance in the front room. Those guitars are reminiscent of Esteban when he used to play the Scottsdale Princess. The Southwest food is good, hearty even, and reasonably priced. The drink menu is well suited to the venue. It's a small place, often packed to the seams for performances, complaints about service have to be tempered. The servers do a good job, given the number of orders they get slammed with. We go with friends. It's the kind of place you where you want to share the experience.",

It almost feels like a wine bar when you walk in- appropriately sparse lighting, hip decor, and an openness that beckons you to relax and enjoy. The staff doesn't feel like the airport TSA, which is a welcome change from comparable Phoenix venues.   Having access to real food at a show is a MAJOR plus. It's damn tasty, too.  Drinks are good, not great, but reasonably priced.   The best part: probably the best sound system of any venue I've ever been to- I could hear each instrument from each band member with crystal clarity, nearly perfect balance, and tonal accuracy. The stage is clean, large, and looks like a TV showcase.  Love.",

What to drink... Honey Badger! So delicious and does the trick. Honey bourbon and ginger beer. YUM.   What to see.. Any show is amazing in the ballroom... So far I have seen; CSS, tUnE yArDs, Starfucker, and Poolside. I have tickets for Twin Sister and Young the Giant. Shows are reasonable. The most I have paid for a show was $26 and the least was $5.  You can also just visit without seeing a show. It's so fun to hang out in the lounge to eat and drink. Most of the time, you can still hear the show if you are sitting inside.   *be aware... shows actually start an hour or two after doors open. You may have to wait.",

Exactly what you need, small and intimate but good acoustics and atmosphere. Also I personally hate going to shows and feeling like the old guy (im only 27) but it seems like some of these indie shows are full of highschoolers. At crescent, they kind of separate that, so I can not feel so old. thanks.  Anyway, it was 4/20 so they had free cover. We went right to the bar and got some waters (it was HOT) and beer, and a gin/tonic. All were reasonably priced in a small plastic cup. In order to go into the venue area we had to pay a $5 cover. The band this time was a Nirvana cover band, Im all for nirvana but this band...yikes. Thats okay though, the crowd was great and I definitely recommend coming here to grab drinks in the front room area, hang with friends, or even see a show. Crescent has AWESOME shows that come to it so I am definitely going to check this place out. ALSO the Burritos, i tried some from my friend, and dang. That thing is good. Definitely recommend getting a burrito here. The prices range from about $6-8. The one I tried was bean and cheese with Tillamook cheese which I love. Anyway, good crowd, decent drinks, and AWESOME concert venue. Check it out!",

    "text": "I am here a lot for shows as part of work and we've tried Cocina twice now for burritos before the concerts. I heard they rock. The pork one is just ok. That's not my problem, though. My problem is the first time they forgot my friend's quesadilla. Then they forgot it again.  It was an hour before she got it, and we were all done with everything. They comped her but seriously, it's cheese and tortilla.  This week (Wednesday night) I gave Cocina another shot. Two of us this time. I ordered the pork no onions and it had onions. The waitress sent it back and then (after awhile) the cook brought out a chicken no onion. He immediately realized it was wrong again. By this time the opening band started and I had to get in there to cover the show. Finally the waitress brought me my burrito inside of Crescent an hour after I ordered. By now I had a few beers and wasn't hungry. It wasn't good either.   Kitty the waitress seems cool and claims it's not her fault. First time said it was the kitchen. Second time said there were new changes in the kitchen. I don't want  excuses, I want great service.",

I was told they had an outdoor area too and would love to go see someone and have it be outside.  We had some good drinks and had a quesadilla as a snack. It was good bar food - not sure how you can mess up a quesadilla either.  Definitely will be back and hope its outside next time.",

Nice little patio outside on both sides, average-sized bar area, and then a separate room for shows. I really like seeing shows here. The sound system is great and they even have an area to sit if you don't feel like standing. The drinks are cheap and strong. I've only had their salsa (very good) so can't say much about the food, but I've heard good things. The music is always popping here and Sean Watson makes me smile when he goes on. He played Chromeo's \"Tenderoni\" one time when I was there and I danced so hard I nearly vomited.  If there's a spot you should hit when downtown, it's Crescent.",

The first CWK show was actually the carnivale electric event in the spring. Although it was outdoors and POURING rain the entire time, it was a great set up and a lot of fun was had.   The other 2 shows indoors were awesome, as well. Great sized, intimate venue that brings to town some great, indie acts. The crowd has always been great and I love that they have the bar area near the stage and the under age area up front for all ages shows. I took my daughter to see CWK the 2nd time and we got to be right up front without showing up 2 hours early!! :) She loved it, as did I...mainly because I wasn't watching in the rain this time around.   I will continue to check their schedule and hope to make one of their trivia nights or even just pop in for an impromptu concert some time. Who knows, I might find a great new act to follow!",

I think it'd take a very particular type of person not to like this place. I mean, the food is excellent (I had the mouth-watering Lalo burger, with sauteed green peppers and melted cheddar cheese) and the look of the place is neat; I'm guessing it was an old mechanic shop long ago. Last but not least, this place gets some of the best musicians I know of to play here, and they're kind enough to stream the music live from the show inside to those outside (who may have not bought their tickets before the show was completely soldout - heh).  From 90's acts with cult followings such as the Dandy Warhols and Eels to up-and-coming indie stars like Phantogram and Allah-Las, this place gets the shows I want to see.  I'll be returning many more times.",

To my delight, it was a small and intimate venue. There was plenty of parking right in front which made me very excited. The doorman was very nice and told me about the metered parking. Wow thanks! Friendly bouncers, totally not what I'm used to coming from NYC.   Inside, the venue was split into two different rooms. The front half looked like a cocktail/sports bar where I got to catch the ending of a Warriors game. The back half was the music venue which also had bleacher type seating in the back of the room. I had a great time not feeling squashed or trampled and just enjoying a weekday out immersed in music.",

The restaurant has an adaptive reuse warehouse vibe with lots of wood, metals and glass. Very urban and trendy looking.  Pros: I ordered three tacos, 1 shredded chicken, 1 barbacoa and 1 blackened tilapia. All 3 tacos were delicious and I was very happy with my order. The ingredients (avocado, cilantro, tomato, cabbage) were fresh, and the presentation of the food was good. I personally liked the barbacoa taco the most, had a little spicy kick.  Cons: Service was slow and our waitress seemed disengaged. There was a 20 minute lag between members of our party receiving their main course lunch orders. I know there are longer waits at lunch, but it shouldn't take that long to serve tacos.  Overall I enjoyed the food and my dining experience at Crescent Ballroom and would return.",

We were a little hesitant to come in because the music was fast and a little loud, but the reviews said the food was good, and we might be old, but we aren't That old that a little loud club music would make us turn away. Okay. Drinks (margarita and sangria) were very good and big. I had the shrimp taco and the braised beef taco. Seriously delicious. Husband had the chicken enchilada. He enjoyed them. Wait staff was perfectly pleasant and very helpful--I was served a chicken taco instead of the shrimp one I ordered. They noticed before I did, and brought me the shrimp taco very quickly. Worth the wait! We are from California, and compared to California Mexican food, this place's flavor was right on par with the best. The prices were delightfully cheaper than what we are used to paying. Especially the drinks. Will come here again--maybe even for the drag show--next time we are in town. Made me feel like I was back in college with the Fugees on blast and the cozy, laidback atmosphere. You have to give this place a try.",

We enjoy trying new places and were told this spot is where the \"locals\" go after work.  We walked-up and the place wasn't too busy. It was 530 pm on a Tuesday. (Yesterday) we found 2 seats at the bar and greeted the bartender. The guy was mid 20's, sandy brown hair, thin, facial hair. He asked what we wanted and we asked if there were any specials. This clown actually took a drink menu and tossed it at us and said, \"Here, you can read.\" Wow, really? I chuckled because where I am thinking, \"Forget this guy,\" my buddy is still being friendly. He asks for what kind of whiskey is used in the Old Fashion and again the guy points at the menu and says, \"It says right here.\" pointing.  My buddy ordered the Old Fashion and I asked what IPA's on tap he had. He pointed behind him and said, \"They're right there.\"   LOL, OK... so customer service isn't your strong point. Neither is being friendly. I ordered an IPA and asked if we wanted to open a tab. I gave him my credit card and told him to open the tab. He went to the register, rang the bill up then closed us out. Handing my the receipt and asking for me to sign. He also asked, \"What bar you going to next\" with an obvious insinuation he didn't want us there. I guess we were going to be one and done with this bozo. We didn't even finish our drinks. We left not wanting to be around this guy. Not the kind of guy I would waste on by being around his negative vibe. I wrote zero tip on the line, but my buddy being in customer service left a $3 tip and said maybe it would help the guy buy a better personality.  We left and headed to the Valley bar.  Was told by the bartender at the Valley Bar that the owner owns both places, it's just that the Crescent was opened years before the Valley. He constantly apologized for the rude service we got at Crescent.",

We had the Lalo Burger and the Chicken Burrito in a bowl which I would definitely recommend.",

I spent money on one drink for my friend and another on myself with a shot to go with it. We left to go outside and put my purse in the car to prepare for the excitement of the show. When we came back, they said that we weren't allowed in because we were too drunk and they didn't want to lose their licence. When I defended myself (without slurred speech) they then said that I could go in, but my friend couldn't.  They almost had me believing she was drunk too, but she wasn't. She just didn't speak up. Turns out she has a hip problem which is why she was walking kinda funny. I told them that I couldn't leave my friend out here and that we wanted my money back if we couldn't see the show. They refused and and we were forced to leave. I spent a total of about $45 there and didn't get to watch the show we came there for! The security team and bartenders are rude! The drinks are overpriced for there quality as well. Enter at your own risk!!!",

Decided to stop in on my way to a meeting downtown recently and the burrito was as good as I remembered and definitely filling! Both the red and green salsas are delicious -- the green more tangy and the red offering a little more heat.  The service was friendly but I was a little disappointed to get a flat soda replaced with another flat soda with no one sticking around to see if it was any better (which it wasn't, obviously). When my food arrived, I let them know there was no improvement and requested water instead and I wasn't charged for the soft drink. Good communication, but I really could've used that caffeine boost to survive my meeting.   Metered parking so come prepared!",

St. Vincent, Phantogram, and Eliot Sumner are some of the artists I've been fortunate to see at this intimate venue.  If you're not one to crowd towards the front of the stage there's also bleacher style seating in the back that also has a great view.  Tickets are fairly priced and sometimes you can snag a free ticket if you grab lunch on a Tuesday.  Best time to beat the Tuesday lunch rush is either at 11:30am or after 1pm.  I recommend the tacos for lunch or Happy Hour.  For a bit of subtle heat try the Tinga Taco. No heat? Try the Pacific Chicken Taco.    I've received tickets to three separate events from Ticket Tuesday thus far:). It's a great way to sample the menu.",

    "text": "Seen several shows here, awesome venue, great shows. The food is alright and the drink list leaves a lot to be desired (as a beer drinker).  My only real beef with this place is every one working there thinks they are God's gift to the service industry. They are a venue that damn near refuses to sell tickets to their own shows, if you go in to avoid the $12 online  \"convenience fees\" and ask to buy tickets the bartenders will literally just walk away and tell the other bartenders not to bother with you until some unwitting server happens by because that is apparently their responsibility and it is clearly beneath the bar staff. Happens every time. The servers have no clue how to actually sell tickets and when they finally figure it out there are still processing fees because they are acquiring them 3rd party. It will take you no less than 20 min, 15 of which is just standing awkwardly at the bar waiting for the poor server that ask you if you've been helped, to buy tickets to a show. Half way through trying to sell you tickets she will walk off to tend her tables without a word to you and, if you are lucky, hand you off to another server that walked up to tell her she's got a table. Every. Single. Time. I've never in my life seen a venue that can't, physically can't sell tickets to their own shows. And if you ask why you are paying an additional $5 for $20 tickets AT THE VENUE there's a guy server who clearly thinks he's still a bouncer at whatever the last shit hole he worked at is, who is more than happy to get in your face SUPER aggressively about it and tell you you can fuck off and try to buy your tickets elsewhere if you don't like it. Not even sure where that guy came from or why he was eavesdropping and interrupting but you'll know hes there for sure.  The venue it's self is awesome and the shows are legit, food is pretty good but not impressive and drinks are small venue drinks, but the entire staff needs a refresher course in customer service and you should be fully prepared to pay about 25-50% more than the Falsely advertised ticket prices (depending on how many you buy) because they don't even handle their own tickets IF you have the patience to repeatedly flag down staff members until you get one that will actually do there job. Pretty much has been the same experience just eating dinner there when I did eat the fees and buy tickets online. The wait staff is very much the \"fly by\" type who doesn't have time for you, doesn't care to answer any questions about the menus, don't know the beer lists and has no problem making it clear they have other shit to do than deal with you.  You want to pay hiked, Falsely advertised prices for a show and not deal with the staff, this is the place for you. You want to buy your tix at the box office to get (close to) the advertised price and grab a bite and a drink before the show I'd not get your hopes up.",

I love that the building fits in so well with the surrounding area.   One thing I really do want to try, though, is their food. Unfortunately by the time my friends are ready to go out, food is no longer being served. I guess beauty is sacrifice. Ha.

And.... super reasonable alcohol prices! A large row of bleacher seating lines the back wall so people wanting to sit have opportunity to do so.  I read reviews on Yelp about their Mexican food, served up front in an open air style restaurant. The food was absolutely excellent! We brought two starving college students with us so after they ordered six things between them, we were able to sample a decent part of their menu. Highlights are their guacamole, Sonoran hotdog and baked nachos were all highlights, two types of salsa amazing with excellent spice. I googled the restaurant menu to remind myself of the many dishes the kids ordered, and found out the restaurant is Concina 10 - started by chef Chris Bianco - which all makes sense now as to why the food is so outstanding. Chris also started Pizza Bianco in Phoenix, which has been recognized by several food writers as the best pizza in the United States.  This was my first visit to Crescent so definitely will be back to see more bands in this space, and also be back to dine there more often.  A final comment for concert goers under 21.... this is a great venue to get up close with the artists! The under 21 section opens up right up to the stage and even though the show we saw was sold out (Alex and Sierra), there are far less people in the under 21 section so a lot of standing room and stage access.",

First, they have a lot of fantastic local and national acts that play here. It's big enough for a mid-sized national band, but it still feels intimate. Also, I'm way too old to stand for an entire concert if I don't have to, so I appreciate the bleacher seats in the back. I don't always use them, but it's nice to know I can.  As far as food and drinks go, Crescent is solid. They have a decent craft beer selection and the food is good. The menu is fairly simple, but what they have is tasty. The bartenders and servers have always been quick and attentive.  Also, on Sunday nights they do a decent trivia. It's pretty eclectic, but it's a good time. They give out pretty awesome prizes to the top 6 or so teams including various gift cards, random gift baskets (like a bacon-themed one), concert tickets and various kitchy items. Last time we played we won a lucha libre action figure- score!",

It was pretty chill and there was a nice patio outside to sit down and relax. Inside, they were showing a movie on the screen but with a DJ playing music. A couple of drunks in there, but not bad enough to ruin the night. It was our last stop on our Friday night and it was a fun way to end it.",

They didn't have fans or open doors or anything else to try to neutralize the odor. After feeling sick from an hour of being there I had to step out to get some fresh air but then came back in as the headliner was starting their set. After an hour and a half long set my head was KILLING me. The performance was great but I don't know if it was worth the migraine and upset stomach.",

    "text": "Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  It's a great spot to grab a bite before a show at Crescent Ballroom.  Expect it to be loud if a show has already started, but you'll still appreciate the atmosphere.  Old movies play on the wall, the bar is accessible, and, if it's not too hot, there's a sizable patio.  On our first visit, we waited longer than we'd like for service and menus after seating ourselves.  After flagging down a busboy, he delivered on his promise to get our server over quickly and came back to explain that they'd just had a rush of close-outs.  Once our server appeared, we ordered two cocktails:  a Coronado Ice Water and a Honey Badger.  The Honey Badger, a tasty mix of whiskey, lime, and ginger beer, was great but the Coronado Ice Water was a little hard to stomach - too sour and not enough flavor to complement the taste of tequila.    We also ordered guacamole and chips as an appetizer and the poquito bean and cheese burrito and al pastor burrito.  Food came out quickly and, in contrast with our initial service, the server came back fairly regularly to check in on us.  The guacamole was delicious, topped with cotija and featuring segments of orange that lend a pleasant sweetness to the guacamole.  The chips were crunchy and thick, perfect for scooping guacamole.  The burritos are by no means the best in the Valley, but are palatable.  They are a good size and well-rolled, making them easy to manhandle.  The tortillas are substantial and have good texture and flavor.  I added rice and jalapenos to the poquito bean and cheese burrito and was pleased to discover the jalapenos were fresh, not pickled.  There was a good balance between the beans, rice, and cheese, but not a lot of spice throughout even with the addition of jalapenos.  In the future, I might try to use salsa or hot sauce to add some flavor.  The al pastor was tender but perhaps a little too sweet; the pineapple flavor is definitely not lost in the mix.  Mixed with refried beans, it makes for a slightly messier, but still manageable, burrito than the poquito,    Overall, I'd definitely recommend Cocina 10 if you're at Crescent for a show or need a late night bite (they're open until midnight every night), but would not make a point to stop in for food otherwise.  Although the menu bears the stamp of Chefs Chris Bianco and and Doug Robson (Gallo Blanco), it doesn't hold a candle to their own restaurants' fare.",

I had never eaten here before so I was excited for the opportunity to try their menu.  I ordered the blackened fish tacos.  The blackened seasoning was to my liking - just black enough but not burn my mouth spicy.  My friend J ordered a blackened fish taco and a veggie taco.  She raved about the veggie taco so much I got order envy so I'm going to make sure I order them next time.  S had a bean and cheese burrito and after saying how good it was she offered us each a taste.  It was a very good burrito.  I usually find the tortilla overpowers the filling but this tortilla was strong enough to do its job but thin enough to get out of the way.    Our waiter asked if we wanted salsa and brought us both red and salsa verde.  The red salsa is not to be trifled with - it is SPICY!    Sorry Fuego, maybe next time!",

We only stayed there for 20 min and in that duration he told us 3 times to leave. The last time he told us he said we have to drink fast now and leave basically chug and go.

All in an intimate setting where I can be so close to Ra Ra Riot that my photos make me look as if I was part of the press.  I find myself going to so many more shows than I did before, and I get to have a burrito while I'm there too. Who doesn't want a burrito while they're at a show? NO ONE. And you can order it without leaving the concert space, because there's a bar in the back.  Most of the space is standing room, but there are bleachers in the back too and some small tables also. The sound is amazing and I've never once been to a show I didn't like.   I'm in love.",

The size of the venue is absolutely perfect; large enough for a good-sized crowed, but it's still small enough for an intimate vibe. The best part of Crescent is that I've seen everyone from tiny local bands to huge, top 40 bands (from Playboy Manbaby to Walk the Moon). The security here is SO friendly and helpful; as a teenage girl, I always feel safe and welcome. The under 21 section size changes based on how many people there are, but you can be close to the stage regardless of your age group bI've never had a bad experience at Crescent. Parking is cheap and there's a lot right on the property that usually has space, and there's plenty of street parking or other lots around. It's also very easy to meet the artists after a show which is always fun.",

Through my typical dumb luck, which I am blessed to have in spades, I was able to get tickets to a show on this particular night that I needed them.   I showed up late and what do you know, I walked down and took someone's seat in the front row.   The singer, a blonde woman, age unknown, is like \"I'm gonna free style. I hope you don't mind.\" So, of course, the crowd goes wild without knowing what's coming.   And she starts sing a Toby Lightman song:  \"Did I see you winkin' or is that me thinkin'?  Should I show affection to the guy in the front row?  Did I see you smile 'cause you been here for a while  Should I make a connection with the guy in the front row?   \"But you don't know where I'm from, where I belong All you know is my name And you only know what you see and that really isn't me But I'm glad you came  DALLAS here again interrupting my own story:  Now I'm thinking, is this a coincidence or am I the guy in the front row? Cause, you know, I'm the fricken guy in the front row.   Ok back to the story:  Her still singing...  \"Are you makin' passes while I'm pleasin' the masses?  Well, I know all about you, you're the guy in the front row  AND THEN I SWEAR SHE LOOKS AT ME! WINKS. SHE WINKS! I of course am bright red and embarrassed.   \"Are you trying to distract me, while you're tying to attract me? But I what to do, about you in the front row\"  OK... So here's the part you're all hoping for... my emotional devastation.   She finishes the song in which she say's she's glad \"I\" came... Asks lyrically if \"I\" want to hang... and at the end... She's like come here, guy in the front row.   She wags her finger in the exact way you want a relatively attractive woman to wag her finger and I get up... and she bursts out laughing hysterically... and she can't stop. She's like dying of laughter. That fucking bitch is crying laughing at the stage and everyone saw me get up... fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.   She was fricking wagging her damned finger at the guy next to me... who like got up and smelled her knee. I'm sure she would have made out with him but she was still laughing.   So anyway, if you want THAT kind of relationship with the artists. That's what you get. you can like see their cloven hooves if they're devil women like her. Or whatever.   It's quite literally the best place in town to see a show or be the show and get seen or watch trendy people in their natural habitat.",

    "text": "It is about damn time we get a sweet Indie music venue in Downtown PHX.  Even when they are just rolling with a DJ the music is always setting the mood.  I have yet to try their food but it looks to be a simple and tasty menu which includes pub favorites like burgers, nachos and burritos.    Crescent is consistently packed on weekends, they manage the crowds well for one exception, the front restroom.  Only one unisex bathroom is available up in the front lounge area and on a busy night you can be in line for a bit.    Now I don't have to put up with poor venue situations like The Clubhouse or Marquee to enjoy some of the artists that are making their way into PHX.",

    "text": "If I could put 0 stars I would! First off I went to eat Brunch which was ok for generic Mexican food. My waitress was horrible with service. I felt I flagged her down for everything I needed. On top of her providing bad service The dumb girl charged me twice on my card and never even thought to tell me. When I asked to speak with the manager, a man name Joe came to see what this issue is. He was rude and had no empathy for my concern that my card was charged twice. If fact his exact comment was \"What do you want me to do about it.? its not like we need to take your money\" It has now been 4 days and the charges are still on my account. I called and spoke with a Irene who did like the fact that I was a upset customer and hung up on me. I called back and asked for the owner info and she said to go find it on google.Now I have spent way to much time trying to get my money back for a nasty breakfast. I should even wasted my money or time on.I never will go back.",

Everything else is spot on: Medium-sized space that feels intimate but not cramped; great sound equipment; stage is the perfect height; bleachers in the back of the room; 2 bars run by friendly people & phenomenal food.  If you haven't been: check out their calendar and try to make it in soon. Or if you'd rather just grab a bite and skip the show, you can go into the front section (\"The Lounge\") and just eat and have a drink without buying a ticket. I recommend the nachos.",

I didn't make that show, but was familiar with the name of the venue the second time that band played, and showed up not knowing what to expect.  I love the ambiance of this place. You get to really see the band up close and personal, and the sound is phenom. The environment is great for local bands and there isn't a bad spot in the place.  Drinks were awesome, and the food was fantastic (and not as expensive as I had anticipated. Hell, I hadn't anticipated food, period, given it was a music venue). But of course the food would be great, considering the kitchen is overseen by Chris Bianco, who is responsible for the masterpiece that is Pizzeria Bianco.  Can't say enough good stuff about this place!!!",

Places to put your food and drink if you want to mill about.  The place is pretty small so if your favorite band comes through here it's a MUST that you check them out - very intimate.  Another bar towards the back is pretty accessible and the bathrooms are never a hassle.",

And so much more. As we're standing there sipping our Champagne of Beers and someone says:  \"Damn, that's a really good Jimmy Eat World cover band playing.\"  And then someone else says:  \"Wait a second! That IS Jimmy Eat World!\"  So awesome. So 2001.  The atmosphere of this place is great. You have a big outdoor area with space heaters for the cancer lovers, a nice sized front area for the boozers with high top tables and low tables, also plenty of room to stand and chill. The music venue is spacious and well amped.   Apparently the food is great, I would definitely give it a try next time.  One star off for the minimal bathrooms. There was always a huge line.",

First of all he would  charge drinks to other customers really cheap but when I went over he would not let me order more than two drinks because it was \"state law.\" Keep in mind I wasn't even drunk.m, but when someone else ordered he would allow them to buy more than two drinks. I finally brought my friends to the bar and when it came to the bill, he charged me $9.00 for a shot.  This was ridiculous! I never had such bad service here until today.  I wish I had  the bartenders name but at least a picture would do.",

They get great headliners and put on a wonderful two-day music festival for Dias de la Crescent in the summer (I sincerely hope this becomes a standing music festival in the Valley.)  I went to the Halloween Ball and New Year's Eve party where there was free cover and some terrific DJs.  The staff is terrific - the bouncers do a great job with crowd control and you can always get a bartenders attention.  Bathrooms are always clean and the lines usually move pretty quickly.  Drinks are reasonably priced ($4 g&ts) and they make some wonderful house creations such as the \"Honeybadger.\"  Also, it attracts a great blend of people. You can wear just about anything and fit in.   I have so many fond memories of this place and will continue to frequent it.  Crescent Ballroom is one of the coolest venues in Phoenix!",
