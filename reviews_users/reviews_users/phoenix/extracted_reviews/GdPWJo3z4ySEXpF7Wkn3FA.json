The last few times I ordered take out food and I always find the curries highly diluted with water, samosas fried in old oil and their signature biriyani not flavorful at all.  The last time I ordered take out food from there, I even found a piece of meat in my veggie curry!!   Like others have mentioned, the service is poor, the place is highly understaffed and not so friendly staff either.  The place used to be known for its flavorful, cheap food but sadly the quality has degraded over the last few months...",

At first the place seems like it may be a little dissappointing from it's fast food appearance (maybe it was because you have to order your food at the window?)     Don't let the appearance fool you the food is great! The Naan isn't the best i ever had but was good and the meal was excellent. prepare for SPICEY though. They don't skimp on spice for sure and they don't cook it to taste like some resturants I've been to. I loved it though and would definitly go back. The price is right too. Expect to pay abt $11 a person that's including your drink.",

And It kinda felt like eating homemade Indian food that got microwaved  for 1 minute and 30 seconds and then served to us. Prices are reasonable, $8-$10 for a small bowl of curry and meat of your choice and a big plate of white (flavorless) biryani rice.   Would give 5 stars if: 1) Food was freshly made, 2) Hot and 3) More meat :)",

After watching everyone else receive their food (after entering 30+ minutes after us) I decided to enter passive aggressive stare mode with the host.  My non verbal cues were apparently on point and we then received our food with a very brief explanation on how our food was sent to another table minus the apology.  I'd recommend curry corner as long as you don't care for service or an immediate appetite.",

There is decent to good food here depending on what is ordered, and it comes out rather fast, and it is lower priced than most Indian restaurants in the valley.  But there are a few drawbacks to dining here.  Though you're paying a couple bucks less per entree, you're also in a not so clean place that has a lot of wear on it other than perhaps the newish large flat panel TV on the wall.  This was one of those times where I realized that maybe it is worth the price difference.  There was only one server for the entire little restaurant on our visit, so I can see how that was frustrating for the other table that was there before us but ordered after us.  The Mexican hot sauce (Cholula) on each table was an interesting observation.",

Our server was totally awkward.  When the food was ready he literally brought one thing out at a time. The food was soooo boring. The blandest Indian food I have ever eaten. Maybe it's just the vegetarian items that is so tasteless?",

The sauce on it was reallyyyyy good. For the entrees we got the Mixed Grilled Sizzler and the Afghani Boti. Everything was a bit spicy for me since I'm a wuss when it comes to that stuff. lol. I liked the meat in the Afghani Boti and the sauce that it comes with.   The service... was extremely slowwwwww... It took maybe 20 minutes before we even got our waters. We ordered the fries as an appetizer. Which never came out. They ended up coming out with everything else. Other then that it was quite an experience. I might come back if I'm ever in the mood for something different in my life again. =)",

Menu Prices on Yelp are different as to the Menu Prices in the restaurant. This is giving a consumer a False impression about the prices. I am serious, this is not right.   Message to the owner - If you think I am right then you should compensate me for the difference. I am willing to come back and order the same food but you should charge me per the menu prices on Yelp, if not, I understand but I am not coming back to your place.  Thank You !",

The food is phenomenal. We tried a little of everything here and wow. SO fresh, so delicious, and what an experience. If you are not familiar with Indian food, this is a great place to start because once you've had the best, the other restaurants won't matter.  And I hope they've fixed the ceiling since our visit...because a place like this is worth preserving!",

    "text": "Easily the best Indo-Pac food in Arizona, but don't just take my word for it. When I started coming here they were a 2 star joint and all the reviews complained about slow service, cramped dinning rooms and long wait times, but I went on an off night when I expected that not too many people would be in. We had an amazing meal.   Since then, they have expanded the dinning area by double and have hired more hands to take and deliver orders...That should put those 1 and 2 stars to rest. Now about what makes them a 5 star place and really, the only Indian food place you need to have on speed dial.   Their Tikka Masala is absolutely divine. I use this dish as my litmus test...If the masala is garbage, chances are the rest of the dishes follow...But this place...Holy mother of all things great and small. It is one of the best dishes they have on the menu. The chicken is tender, the sauce nice and warm, creamy and so aromatic. Couple this with some of their garlic naan and you have a dish that puts you halfway to Nirvana.  Other dish recommendations: the Chicken Jalfrezi (my wife's words on this one) was \"a transcendent experience\". She allowed me a few bites and it was mind blowing. The peppers and onions, the meat slow cooked into spicy mouthfuls of beauty...Think I am overplaying my hand? Friggin try this place.  If none of this sways you, let me put it this way. I came here once. It is now my only Indian restaurant. I tell everyone I meet about it and it becomes their ONLY Indian restaurant. One try and you will see why I sing this place's praises to anyone who will listen.",

I cannot say how disappointed we are about the experience. The food was awful!  The plates are served institution style, aluminum plates with dividers. I am assuming for portion control.  We ordered two plates; The tikka masala was watered down and the riata looked like skim milk. It came with a small piece old lettuce and tomato, by far this is the worst Indian food I have ever had. The other plate was goat curry, it was a little better, at least it was not watered down, but it was hard and chewy.  Do not get fooled by the Food Network Hype, I am sure they prepared days in advance for the visit. This is not the case for the regular customers. The place was packed with mostly Anglo clients, I am sure they were there for same reason we went.  The service was not great either, too busy for 1 server. Very disappointed!",

The food:  The girlfriend and I like to get samplers so we can try a wide range of food, both times we got 1 non-veg, and 1 veg combo.  I highly recommend that to a) people looking for variety and b) people looking for leftovers.    The first time we went we saw these incredible looking fries come out so it was a must order the 2nd time through.  The Tikka Misala fries were very good.  I feel like the menu said feta but we got blue cheese.  It was still very delicious.  The only thing I would enjoy more would be more naan to come with it,  I know I could order more but I am too busy enjoying the deliciousness.    Have been looking for a reliable option for this kind of food nearby and I think I've found it.  Can't wait to try more of the menu.",

My g/f and I wanted lunch near our office and had seen Curry Corner but neither of us had ever been before.   It was suspect from the outside but I've learned never to judge a book by its cover. We arrived way before the lunch crowd so the place was empty when we entered.  The decor was okay (sorry didn't really pay much attention) from what I remember.  We decided on a booth since all the spots were open.    On to my next lack of detail.  I don't remember the name of the entree that I ordered.  But I ordered it since it was the closest thing to saag paneer that I could find.  I was not disappointed.  (My younger self would be amazed that I would ever look forward and enjoy eating something that looked that questionable, if you know what I mean).  It was absolutely delicious!! I also ordered a potato naan (guess I really wanted carbs that day) and was also very good.   The service was good.  And by the time we finished our lunch the place was totally full.  The dish my g/f ordered was not what she had visualized but she said it was absolutely delish.    Since it's very close to our job, we will keep this place in mind when venturing out for lunch.",

    "text": "Food: Indian Food Staff: Friendly and helpful Atmosphere: Small little restaurant, but plenty of seats for everyone.   Parking: There is plenty of parking because it is located in a strip mall, but if you are coming along Apache from the west you'll have to make a U-turn down the road.  I've been traveling a lot lately and when I do I have a tendency to watch a lot of Food Network shows.  This place was on an episode of Diner, Drive-ins, and Dives the week before I was going to be in town so I decided to drop in.  Whenever I try a new Indian place I go with the standard Chicken Tikka Marsala and garlic naan.  Since I decided to dine in, I also got a mango lassi to cool down the sauce if needed.  When the dish came out, it seemed like there wasn't much chicken in the dish, but it was really hiding under the sauce.  The sauce had a nice spice to it, I would say closer to hot than warm.  The mango lassi came in handy.  The sauce was also extremely smooth, almost as if it had been processed.  I'm also guessing they finished it off with a touch of butter to give it a nice silky texture.  The garlic naan was good, but had a slight after taste of something.  I'm guessing it was the fuel they used in their oven to cook it, but I can't be sure.  The mango lassi was okay.  The texture was good, but I had hoped for a bit more mango flavor.  So, back to the sauce.  The sauce was so good, that I decided to order a cheese naan to dip in it.  It was good (turned it into an Indian pizza), but the cheese naan is bit heavy.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive and alway kept my water full.  Overall it was good and would be in my top three Indian places.  I'll be back and I'll have to dry the garlic naan and mango lassi again to see if it improves, if so, it would be five stars from me.  Ordered Dish: - Chicken Tikka Marsala - Garlic Naan  - Cheese Naan - Mango Lassi",

Because of its popularity it is often busy and sometimes takes a few minutes to be greeted, however, this adds to the authenticity of the experience. I'm a vegetarian and there is a wide variety. If you like good fresh food, you can't miss this place.",

Ordered Garlic Naan, Cheese Naan (more like a Naanadilla), Some kind of chicken wings, some kind of rice with specks of orange colored things and the grilled mixed meat which is there version of a fajita platter with 2 kinds of chicken, ground meat hot dog looking thing and grilled onions and peppers. Be warned however if you do not like cilantro, as tons of cilantro were on everything we ordered. The service was better than antipated, the dining area was clean and the food very flavorful. $30 for two people and we have a third meal sitting in the fridge for later.",

Here are my reasons.  1: No greeting upon arrival 2: Served flat drinks; had to wait 5-10 mins for new drinks  3: Three people who came in after me, were served before me.  4: Waited 35+ Mins for my Appetizer 5: Girl checking me out tried to give me every excuse in the book as to why my food took so long 6: To be \"Nice\" she said she'll take the drinks off the bill for me....    All in all at the end of the day; I felt like me and my girlfriend as people who also work in the food business should've been treated a little bit better; after having to wait 35+ minutes for food, while customers who came in after us were served before my girlfriend and I; I personally felt like our whole bill should've been comped out due to the certain circumstances we had to deal with.",

    "text": "Went here for the first time last week. I figured since it's been on DDD, it's probably really good. I was excited to try their food since there really isn't many good Indian/Pakistani restaurants in Arizona. We ordered the mix grill, goat karahi, chicken biryani, mango lassi, and 3 garlic naan and cheese naan. The mix grill was delicious however the tandoori chicken was below par. It didn't have any tandoori flavor at all, just the color. The goat karahi was delicious. Probably my favorite dish overall, however it had so much oil, I'm honestly not sure how the US Government hasn't invaded the dish yet. Chicken biryani was good. Mango lassi was good. All the naan was good, however out of the 4 naan we had ordered, we only received the 1 cheese naan. I also decided to place an order to go. I ordered lamb karahi, tandoori chicken, and chicken tikka masala. I prefer the goat karahi over the lamb karahi. Again, tandoori chicken was bland. The chicken tikka masala was tasty. I read a review about someone saying they used too much food dye. I figured they were mistaken for it being turmeric, however they were correct. My hands were yellow 3 days after eating. Overall, the food was flavored well for the most part, however it was lacking in spicyness. Southeast Asian cuisine is known for being spicy and I didn't find that here. I heard someone behind me order not so spicy and I wasn't sure why, there was zero heat. The servers were very attentive before we had placed our order, but never returned after delivering our food. I'll let you all decide wether it's worth returning or not.",

The lamb tikka masala has about 7 small pieces of lamb contained in a small bowl with the sauce.  The lamb is very lean, dry and no flavor, the sauce also no flavor.  Every bite I ate have to add salt in it.  The meal with tips end up around $15. Not worth for the food, taste and money, but friendly service.",

The tandoori wings were so tasty, the hummus was the best we have probably ever had and the lamb tikka malsala was a definite favorite along with the naan bread. Other items were a bit to salty but over all the food was good. Food we gave a rating of 7 out of 10.  Unfortunately the front of the house is where this place needs the most work. Items that were ordered were missing, which may have been the result of the to servers taking our orders. Place could use a good scrub down and some kind of gnat spray. We had to ask for water refills, only to be refilled by what we assumed to be timid tap water. Servers more interested in the grub hub drivers that came in then the actual patrons siting in the restaurant. Unfortunately the service rating from us was a 4.  Maybe better to get food to go next time.",

Either management pays no attention to anyone walking in and just grabbing wrong orders, or they gave the uber driver the wrong order. They vehemently blamed the driver. When calling to resolve it, their line was \"busy\" for 20 minutes straight and then the phone was passed to another person who had no idea why she was speaking to me. I have never dined in but do not plan to in the future, unfortunately.  P.s.

I  ordered The Arabic plate it consist of: Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Curry, Biryani Rice, Yogurt, pickled slices of Onion , Hummus and Naan. I also ordered a Mango Lassi. I brought a ginormous plate of food.  I  got everything but the Curry Chicken. Instead they gave either Lamb or Beef Curry. I was okay with that, being I wanted to try it.  The food was pretty good. The right amount of spices with a hint of garlic. The Naan was perfection. Now, for that Mango Lassi. This was my first one ever. I  like flavor but it wasn't cold. It could have been chilled. I  don't know if Lassi are supposed to be room  temperature. If it is to be served at room temperature. I will never order again.   I probably will not go back.  It was just okay.

Took forever for them to come out, and by the time they finally come out delivered by somebody besides our waiter, they were cold except for in the middle of the fries. It was clear they had been sitting there for a good long time. So about 2 minutes after we got our french fries we got our food. My daughter got the rice and beef. The beef was so tough that using a fork and pressing down and trying to cut it as hard as I could I couldn't cut it. My goat Curry had sharp little pieces of bone in its. Just bone all by itself, not surrounded by any meat. I could easily see biting down on that and really messing up your mouth. The Taste was okay, and the food was warm so at least there's that. We also had to flag down our server for him to finally bring us our drinks.  They did take off the beef dish from our bill. But all in all, a horrible experience.  Cheese naan was wonderful. Two stars for that.",

Most Indian restaurants serve their curries with rice, or nothing at all, so I'm happy to be able to be able to pick one or the other depending on my mood. Both taste equally good with but I prefer the soft yet crispy naan! The portion size of their dishes is large enough that I normally have some for dinner & the rest for lunch.  This place in on my way home from work so I often stop by to pick up a to-go order. They have it ready within 15 to 20 minutes. It's always piping hot & remains that way until I drive home.

    "text": "This is specifically for people with stomach issues and totally my subjective review for those that may share my issues. The chicken based dishes here are extremely spicy, I guess because they don't marinate them without chili and use the same chicken for most curry dishes. Hence even requested at mild, it gets extremely hot- I could only wonder how hot it gets when they add extra chili. I do eat hot food occasionally, but only here,  out of the 3 times I have had these people's food in the last 2 yrs, I get super acid reflux for days after , and iam pretty healthy and fit otherwise- so learnt my lesson finally. What really pissed me off is that I specifically ask them NO spice/ hot, and I get this every time.   Never ever coming back again however desperately hungry iam. Also the service over there, especially if you are a desi is pretty bad, the guy at the door looks down carelessly and looks like he couldn't give a damn. That is the same attitude even if you go in without a takeout. And on top of it, they expect and stand there for a tip while paying them like hawks. The most unprofessional ever.",

I had the tandoori chicken tikka and my husband had the Afghani boti. Both came with some sort of cilantro lime rice and some kind of spicy onions which which was absolutely delicious! The tandoori chicken was sooo flavor packed and cooked to perfection!  The afghani boti was really good but not my favorite.  Service was friendly but really slow, I kept thinking they forgot about us. The tables were dirty and the lighting lacking. Overall, really great Indo-Pak food, highly recommend if you have a lot of time to eat!",

Tonight, I came to the restaurant to have dinner about 40 minutes before closing time and the waiters told us that they are closing and they only take to go orders and there were a bunch of Indian people who just arrived at the restaurant and they served their food on the tables.

I start searching for someone to help me.  Finally found someone.   I was abruptly asked \"for here or to go\" and was told to go grab my own menu, of which I had a lot of trouble finding in this messy place. I sat myself since nobody bothered seating me.   I ordered veggie biriyani and a mango lassi to go. I waited. And waited. And waited. No one made eye contact with me or acknowledged me. No one tried to assure me that I wasn't forgotten or tried to keep me happy with my mango lassie or at least a glass of water.  Approximately 30 minutes later, I caught eye contact with someone flagged him down. He came up to me and told me that my food would be out shortly. Perhaps he picked up on my frustration.  Food came out, after waiting even longer. I was given a ridiculous excuse as to what happened, which I will not even bother to mention. I paid and took my food home. I was unhappy with the veggie biriyani. The menu stated that it has fragrant saffron and other spices. I did not taste or smell a trace of saffron. It was dry and bland. To top it off, there were a couple of pieces of chicken in my VEGETARIAN rice. I am never coming back again.",

    "text": "Curry Corner 1212 Apache Blvd Tempe, AZ 85281  I heard about Curry Corner from a friend who said that they heard about it on Food Network and that it was supposed to be fabulous.  I arrived there at 11:00, only to be told that they don't open till 11:30. No problem to wait and observe that they are currently under construction as they expand to two more stores next door.  Promptly at 11:30 the door opened and I was invited in. The current location is on the smaller side and being under construction is not what I would exactly consider to be highly inviting, however, taking this into consideration, I evaluated only on the food and service.  First on my order list was garlic naan. It came to the table still hot, bubbly and flakey on the edges and chewy in the middle. It was fragrant with the aroma of garlic.  Next, came a bowl of karahi. A dish composed of goat, slow cooked in ginger and spices, onions, yogurt and tomatoes. I love spicy food, and asked for it to be made that way, and the cook happily complied. The dish was excellent and filled with lots of meat that was beautifully tender. I was given a choice of it being served with rice or with naan, and as I had already ordered naan I opted for the rice which was perfectly cooked.  Service was reasonable and the tables were clean.  I am looking forward to coming back after the construction is finished and trying a much larger selection of dishes.  For the time being, I will give them 4 stars for the excellent food.",

    "text": "The first problem we had was upon entering the restaurant. All the seats are weirdly situated and there is no hostess or sign that says wait to be seated. All the tables and chairs were located either too close to a bathroom or too close to the kitchen since it is such a small place. The table configurations were also weird with one booth that had two tables. So imagine a normal booth and on each side there is one person and a table in between. Now imagine the same thing but with two tables in between making the distance between you and the other person twice as distant as before.  When I looked around the place it looked filthy and I did notice a fly that kept flying around, which is not something I want to see or deal with when I'm eating. The paint on the walls was brown which I can only imagine is there to hide the grime. I wonder when the last time was that the whole restaurant received a good cleaning. From the attitude of the waitress, I am doubt it has been recent. Additionally, the service station is visible and there was a tacky sign that said \"EMPLOYEES ONLY\" for the kitchen -- of course it is employee's only.  We had horrible service. Our waitress acted like she had somewhere better to be. She also ignored us when it came time to pay the check which we waited forever for. We tried to flag her down but she wouldn't look at us and literally walked out the front door -- doing who knows what -- only to return 15 minutes later!  I had the tandoori chicken. Overall the food was very bland; I wonder if there was salt and pepper used in the making of it. It all seemed pre-cooked. The sauce that it came with was okay. Parts of the rice seemed undercooked. It was like good rice mixed in with bad rice. The rice should be the same consistency throughout. When we got our coke it tasted like it had root beer in it. I wonder if that was because it literally had root beer in it or because the soda dispenser is not clean.   My clothes smell like curry which I could overlook had the place been good.  To the owner or manager who has been replying on all the bad reviews: don't bother doing that on this one. Just take ownership of the criticism and fix the problems. Stop trying to live off your old successes of being on a television show; there are obvious problems with reoccurring themes which you should clearly be able to see from the amount of times you've had to comment on bad reviews. You really need to call Restaurant Impossible.",

The fam and I decided to give this place a try, even though it is very far from home, but with a recommendation like DDD, what could go wrong?  Well, first off, it's a bit chaotic when you walk in.  No real system to be seated and the tables are weirdly situated.  Once we were seated we were rushed to order... thankfully we mostly knew what we wanted.  I tryed the marsala fries, which were BY FAR the best thing we ate.  Those, I must say are amazing.  I also had a bite of the samosas, which were ok... not really that favorful, and the chicken tikka masala.  Honestly, it was ok, but I've had better... even from Trader Joes.  We also had the goat... this too was ok... better than the masala, but so fatty it was hard to eat.  So, long story short... if you live near here then perhaps hit it up.  Otherwise, check out some Indian food closer to home... that is my recommendation.  You're welcome.",

They don't have enough staff members to handle all their business, both phone orders and dining room.   If you are going to come, just go in knowing that you will be in for a long wait (1.5 to 2 hours) and relax with whoever you'll be going with. This goes for takeout too, I've seen people wait for awhile for their food.  That said, I highly recommend their hummus appetizer, best hummus I've ever had. I love all their Thali plates. Their masala is so yummy. I've had it with chicken and fish, and I really love it with fish.   In the end it is worth the wait, but if the service could tighten up it would be such a better atmosphere. Such a shame to sit there listening to new people gripe about the wait and then shut up once it finally comes stuffing their face.  Oh well!",

The things I need however out of a place like Curry Corner are simple and not always met--quick service, good food, and most importantly a good take-out experience.  \"Take-out experience? What the hell is that, Faraaz?\"  It's several things for me, including the amount of food given when taking out versus when eating in. It's also the quality of the take out box material and strength of the plastic bag they go in. Also, if I choose to not throw away my half eaten meal for a week, take out experience includes the smell of old leftovers (refrigerated and left on the counter).  So yeah, I love and hate Curry Corner because the take out experience just isn't up to par. They seriously will give you almost half the amount of food on many dishes. Plus, it takes forever (which is okay because the food at least tastes really, really good). Everyone is all about the Tikka Masala, but they have many other great items that get overlooked. Branch out, order something you can't pronounce, and prepare to have a great meal at a great price.",

It was really busy on a Friday night at 8 PM. It took a little time to be seated, but you can tell everyone was working very hard.  Food: 1) Tikki Masala Fries - so good! It's a great twist on a classic American side dish. I wasn't hungry, but I couldn't stop picking at it! The topping was addictive! 2) Chicken Makhani - recommended by the owner. It was creamy with a kick and they gave a lot of chicken for $8. The naan was light, crispy yet fluffy, and not overly oiled. It went perfectly with the makhani.",

I love Indian food, I make it at home all of the time but sometimes I like to venture out. The lowdown:  *I got the tikka masala fries and they were good but they desperately needed salt. *Mattar paneer also needed salt and spice, I thought this food was supposed to be full of flavor and spice?No creamy texture and the cheese was rubbery and more firm than it is supposed to be.  *My partner's lamb curry was sadly laden with oil and you could see the separation between the tomato curry and the oil sitting on top. The biggest part of the lamb that was saved for last was mostly, if not all fat.  *Basmati rice needed salt as well, and I'm not a salt fiend! More oil would have helped to make it moist.  *Garlic Naan was crispy and hot.  In conclusion: tikka masala fries and naan were good. I was disappointed at the lack of flavor everything had. If you want one of the best experiences go to Royal Taj here in Tempe, if you want some of the best Indian food in your life go to Delhi Palace in Flagstaff at Woodlands Village.",

I really hope to try the goat next time, last time they were out.  The chicken tikka is juicy, tender and perfectly prepared.  GET THE CHEESE NAN BREAD, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! If you want something to help with some of the spicier dishes, I recommend the lassi, especially if they still have strawberry.  This place is my favorite Indian restaurant, and you can't beat the prices  The only issue I have is the servers.  Some are better than others but I feel like the staff spends more time in the back than up in the front (this could be due to a lack of staffing.). Also the less professional servers are not very friendly and are very lackadaisical.  Don't let this divert you from the stellar food.",

    "text": "I am very disappointed by this place. I eat Indian food at-least once every couple weeks. I decided to go here based on the show Triple D (Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives). Well let me say this place is high up on the dive end of scale and I will never go back.  I placed an order for take-out and ordered the Chicken Tikks Masala (my favorite), Matar Paneer, and Cheese Naan. I walked into the restaurant and there were only two tables taken. That should have been my warning to leave, but no... I said I will give it a try based on Triple D.   I pay for my order and head back to my hotel. No issue with service, I only walked in and picked up my order. I get back and sit down ready to partake on what I am expecting to be some good/great Indian food. This is where the disappointment starts setting in... :-(  I open up the soup container of Chicken Tikka Masala, and I notice something isn't right.. The Masala sauce is very loose, almost like they used skim milk vs heavy cream. So I opened the container of rice to add to it and I took a bite... no seasoning. Just bland white rice. No flavor of cumin, clove or cardamom, not even salt. I taste Tikka Masala sauce and it wasn't good, almost seemed like they left some important spices out.  I then proceeded to open the soup container of Matar Paneer. This was loose as well. I am really getting frustrated now. I take a spoon and search for the peas and a chunk of the Paneer (homemade cheese). Instead of Paneer, it tasted and had the mouth feel of tofu. Very disappointed. I closed up the containers of Chicken Tiki Masala, Matar Paneer, and rice and threw them straight into the trash.   The only thing that was good was the cheese naan.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, in fact in my opinion, it is a disgrace to Indian Food.   I have ate at one other Indian restaurant; Indian Place (Indian Delhi Palace - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/indian-delhi-palace-phoenix?hrid=vLH0tzET4aC02gSgEAWkMw\">yelp.com/biz/indian-delh...</a>) in the Phoenix area, and I should have just went back there.",

One person asked if I wanted a water and forgot right as the other guy saw and said \"ah water\" then brought me the water. After putting in an order they didn't take my menu so the first guy who talked to me asked if I wanted to order again right after I did with the second guy.   If you can stand the mediocre confusing service and the fact that you will have to tell multiple people that you want to order, already ordered, and repeat twice, then you will enjoy some decent food. It is not the best Indian food I have ate before tho, and better places exist with much better service. Also some portion sizes are quite small like the sampler plates and I left not completely full.",

They served me a reheated soggy biryani where the flavor hadnt even reached the rice. The chicken strips were ample and well cooked in brine and it seemed like they had thrown it over half cooked rice with raw masala sprinkled on it.  Unfortunately i was traveling, starved, was craving for rice and didnt have the energy to find another place in that time so i somehow stuffed it in with the raita they served (didnt puke!!)

Chicken Tikka masala was ok. I ordered it spicy but it wasn't very spicy and not quite the flavor I was looking for. Chicken was tender which was good. Staff was nice and attentive, place could use a little more sprucing and make it clear where their front entrance is, we thought it was shut down at first. Definitely worth a try but the flavor wasn't what I was looking for.",

We ordered Tandoori chicken, chicken keema and chicken korma. Both the curries came with rice. The Tandoori chicken to my surprise was really good, the meat was tender and juicy, really enjoyed the chicken. The keema was a disaster, there was absolutely no taste, it was bland and regretted it for ordering. The korma was alright for our taste and was better than keema.   I would want to give them a chance and try other dishes considering the scarcity of good Indian restaurants in the valley. The price is pretty decent for the quantity.",

Based on other reviews, we were worried about the amount of food we would receive and if it would be packaged well, but we were pleasantly surprised that we received a normal amount of food and nothing was spilled or leaking.  The food itself tasted good, but it was just entirely too greasy and oily.  The vegetable handi we ordered was just sitting in so much oil.  The spinach curry and tikka masala were also swimming in far too much oil.  I did enjoy the texture of the naan, fluffy yet crispy on the bottom.  The samosas tasted nice but they did not provide the red and green dipping sauce, which is the best part of eating samosas!  Without the sauces it's just fried mashed up potatoes.  I will likely not order from here again, but I do not regret ordering from here, if that makes sense.  FYI tip for others - the medium spice level is really not that spicy at all. if you are looking for a bit of heat, go for hot!",

Pictures do not do the tikka masala fries any form of justice because no camera in existence is capable of capturing the full spectrum of their awesomeness.  For only a few bucks you get a generous portion of delicious french fries SMOTHERED in tikka masala sauce, drizzled with some white yogurty sauce, and then topped with feta cheese.  OH MAN.  It was so good that I would be very inclined to make the 400 mile drive from LA just to eat those fries again.  I couldn't finish them on my own so I took half home, even though I was worried that they'd be soggy the next day.  But turns out, they were STILL GOOD as leftovers.  I swear, that tikka masala must be magical as both a goldmine of flavor and as a preserver of all that is goodness.  I also highly recommend the goat karahi.  So much spices and deliciousness in one dish, I definitely got the curry sweats afterward but it was SO worth it.  I can't even imagine how much spicier some of their dishes must be, considering the karahi wasn't even marked on the menu and yet it was able to sizzle my mouth adequately.  Didn't learn until a month later that the joint was featured on Diners, Drive Ins, & Dive's.  No wonder the TV was only tuned to the Food Network!  Definitely coming back here next time I'm in the area.  Hopefully Guy Fieri isn't there, since I can't really stand his face.",

Although to be fair I didn't give the food real chance.  It was hard for me to stomach.  My wife enjoyed the tandoori chicken.",

We went for a late lunch around 2pm so it was pretty empty, only 2 or 3 other tables taken. Immediately upon entering we were overcome with the warm enticing aroma of the many exotic spices. We ordered the 2 most popular dishes, chicken tiki masala and chicken makhani. We got one order of rice, one regular naan, and one cheese naan. I can't possibly stress enough how amazing and delicious everything was. The waiter was very helpful, we told him it was our first time there and he guided us to their 2 most popular dishes. They were a little on the spicy side, but so incredibly flavorful that we couldn't let that stop us from enjoying it.  For such an average looking place we were absolutely blown away by how good the food was, and so reasonably priced we will DEFINITELY be going back very soon!",

This place seems family owned and was featured on a Guy Fieri show, and they have a rather large display of him behind their cashier.   I came with over 10 of my family members and we tried an assortment of dishes. The Chicken Tikka Masala was pretty average- it was a tad too spicy and I thought served an unsatisfying amount of chicken. The naan bread was also only OK, I preferred it with garlic but found some pieces slightly burned. I also tried a bit of the mixed tandoori grill and there was barely any flavor or seasoning, although the meat was tender. The best dish was a green curry lamb, which had good flavor.  This place is affordable and good for groups, but just standard in terms of Indian food.",

Bad idea. I ordered chicken tikka masala and got chicken tikka soup. The masala that was there was super watered down, and the chicken was a mix of white meat and brown meat, some of the brown meat was so tough that I had to leave a few pieces of the chicken uneaten. The naan was really good, but the chicken tikka masala was very sub par. To make matters worse, it cost a whopping $7. When $7 gets you much more food at other places, I doubt you are going to venture back here. I suppose it was worth a try, but its not worth the return.",

People often say, figuratively, 'this left a bad taste in my mouth,' this drink makes you say it literally.

Our mouths had no refuge as we sipped the mango to get the chicken out of our mouths and then back to our sewer water.

    "text": "I make a habit of visiting Food Network locations, and usually they are just as amazing as the show says...Curry Corner is just 'ok'.  I've had Indian/Pakistani food all over the country and this did not stand up to the hype on Food Network.  I've been there 3 times and have had the Chicken Tikka (featured), the Tikka Masala, and the Aloo Saag.  The Chicken Tikka was great, but the other two were the exact same dishes you'd find at any average Indian restaurant.  The food has also been luke-warm every single time, like it had been sitting for about 10 minutes before being brought out.  Food-wise this comes nowhere near the really good Indian places I've been...it's not bad, but not great either.  Now onto the service, which is where most of this review score comes from.  The customer service is TERRIBLE.  Everyone working there acts like they have no idea what's going on, like this is their first time in a restaurant and they don't know how it works.  My party of two had to wait for 15 minutes before being seated and there were only 2 other families in there.  They gave us literally 10 seconds to look at the menu before very briskly asking for our order, and then looking offended when we said we needed more time.  The food took WAY too long (and like I said felt like it had just been sitting), and the check took even longer.  We didn't have a consistent waiter, different people kept coming over to us and I really got the impression that they don't have any type of consistent system for waiting on their guests.  In general, everyone working there acts like they don't care that you came in and are deciding to spend your money there.  It makes me not want to come back.  CURRY CORNER: if you are reading this, go hire a consultant to come in and show you how to run a restaurant.  You really really need some help with this.  The restaurant itself is shabby and the tables and booths are arranged really awkwardly.  It's not particularly clean or festive looking and the fish tank is really really dirty.  I could see into the kitchen and that didn't look very clean either.  There is no music playing and it makes it way too quiet and awkward in there.    Sadly, I don't agree with Guy Fieri on this one.  You can find better food and better service at other Indian spots in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Seating:  Confusing; the table set up is strange and it's unclear if you should seat yourself or wait to be seated.  They left the table dirty that was next to us the whole time we were there, and it was actually connected to our table.  Drinks:  My wife's mango lassi was completely forgotten (thankfully we weren't charged), and my water was never refilled even though it was empty before I got my main dish.  Food:  Overall very good; bold flavors, great textures, and the prices are extremely reasonable for what you're getting.  Service:  This is the doozy.  The server was cold, inattentive, distracted, and careless.  At one point while we were eating we saw a few people walk in and then stand there awkwardly because they were not greeted.  Our server peeked his head out, saw them, and then continued talking to someone in the back.  It blew my mind.  The young girl who brought us our food seemed nice though, and was the only pleasant encounter we had while we were there.  Honestly, my wife and I are both caucasian, and I wouldn't even mention this if I didn't feel like it was part of the reason why they treated us like we weren't even there.  Overall:  A restaurant can serve the best food in the world, but if the service is as bad as what we experienced tonight, it just wouldn't be worth it to go back.  We'll consider ordering takeout, but that's it.  We truly felt unwelcome there from the time we walked in to the time we walked out.",

The food is just unhealthy with tons of oil floating on the top of curries, and I am not sure if any health/hygiene code is followed here.  The service is poor and the information on its website is incorrect, the owner does not allow dine-in after 9 or 10 even though it says that the restaurant is open till 11.   One night I saw the owner cleaning the place without gloves and she was nice enough to give us a to-go parcel without cleaning her hands (great example to the servers!). I had a peek inside the kitchen when the door was ajar, and it definitely looked dirty.  I have been a lot of hole-in-the-wall places around this restaurant, including Haji Baba, the Vietnamese place and others, but neither any of my friends nor I have fallen sick coz of the food. If you need a spicy-food fix, i strongly recommend you do not try this place, lest you want a visit to the doctor the very next day.",

    "text": "I went here last week with a large group (6 people). We ordered 5 dishes including two orders of chicken tikka masala, goat curry, chicken achari, and palak paneer. Overall we all (including one friend who is Indian) thought it was not the best Indian food we have had....the tikka masala was alright, but wasn't as rich or flavorful as other tikka masalas I have had. I did not care for the chicken achari, but I have not had that before, so it may just not be something I like in general. The palak paneer was alright, but again, was somewhat bland. The goat curry, in my opinion, was the best thing we had. It had a lot of goat flavor (which I like), and was generally tasty. The meals all came with either rice or naan, but disappointingly, the rice was plain white rice (no spices in it like most basmati rices) and the naan was also plain. Still nice that it was included...which brings me to the reason this place is 3 stars and not 2....it is soo inexpensive! We each paid six dollars and change for all of that food....most places would be well over 10$ each, so that is worth an extra star all on its own. I probably wouldn't come here if you want amazing food, but if you want decent food on the cheap, this is your place!",

From the fluffy perfectly baked naans to the rich curries with cuts of meat that remind one of what meat is supposed to be like, I've enjoyed everything I've tried here. From what I could make out this is a smallish family-run place (with a warm friendliness to match), but it seems to be expanding a bit. The decor is simple, as is the service - you get your own drinks and order at the counter - but that stuff is unimportant. What is really important is the quality, and this place delivers in every way.  If you like (north) Indian food, you'll find yourself at home - the spices and preparations are similar, though perhaps a little richer, and the names are different. And based on the Indian places I've seen in Phoenix, this place is far superior. I particularly recommend the Beef Achari, which was the first thing I tried there; I do want to try a biryani and see how that it, so watch this space for updates.  In short, if you want an awesome dining experience on a very reasonable budget, this is one of the best places you'll find, I guarantee.",

You get either naan or basmati rice with the dish, but we got both. Our meal ended with clove-infused rice pudding... which was addicting! Our server was very friendly and had good recommendations. There is no ambiance, so don't go expecting a classy atmosphere. This place is for people that appreciate good and unique food. Looking forward to trying more off of their amazing menu!",

I'm sure as we become more familiar with the 'menu' , we will feel confident about ordering with the correct names of the dishes.  The incredible curry chicken can be made very spicy or hot upon request. The plain or garlic naan compliments any dish. The Masala Fries will make you drool! The tandoori chicken with rice or on a skewer tastes is succulent and authentic. The goat stew (I don't know what it is called) just makes me want more, more, more!   ** Look up Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Drives online for this restaurant to read suggestions or watch the episode for a better understanding on what to order. **  We found if we speak up politely about specific elements of the service we may feel needs correcting, the owner is very open to and appreciative of constructive suggestions! We try to be respectful of her time since she is very busy!  Each time we go, we see changes and improvements in this lovely restaurant. We are very supportive and patient of the transition process they are experiencing. The owner seems truly dedicated to providing a great dining experience to enhance the awesome food!

They actually stop taking call orders at 10:30pm and they close their dine in at 10pm   Appetizer  Tikka masala fries with some Queso fresco Cotija cheese! No but for real, this was the first time in my life that I felt I was in a Mexi-Indian restaurant with the spices and the cheese part to the fries order!!! 10/10  Next up some tandoori chicken , I believed it was . Omg! The chicken was like rotisserie chicken but much more tender and flavorful !! 10/10 stars! Last but no least,  Lamb curry with garlic naan ! A M A Z I N G!!!  If you're a fan of Birria (Mexican goat curry) this dish is totally relatable ! It was too good!  Our waitress Gina was great! Loved how they were very welcoming and always being attentive !  Definitely will come back!!  Gracias paisanos!! Me siento como en casa! :D",

We ordered the samosas and hummus with garlic naan for appetizers-both were tasty. My husband also ordered a mango lassi, but he never received it. There were only two employees in the dining area  while we were there and one was on a cell phone the entire time, even as several people came in to pick up food from her. Personally, I thought it was rude.   My Husband ordered the tikka masala and I ordered the nehari which was a little spicy, but very good.   Overall, the food was good and reasonably priced, but the service was subpar. They discounted our bill for not bringing the lassi, which was appreciated. It seems that ordering take out is the more popular route here. I would consider takeout in the future, but I probably wouldn't dine in again.",

My food was served timely, and there was not a long wait. My Hummus was quite delicious, and my Chicken Tikka Masala was very very good.

My friend swore by Curry Corner as his choice for most authentic, so as a huge fan of Indian food (and food in general, let's be real, this is Yelp), I bookmarked it and tried it within the week.  I ordered the lamb tikka masala with naan, which came out of the kitchen after about 10 minutes. At first I thought it would't be enough food, but I suppose I underestimated and left fat and happy. The lamb was choice although some pieces were a bit dry. The naan was fresh out of the oven, buttery and flaky. The tikka masala sauce was excellent and authentic as any I've had.   I do however have to knock down a star for the cup they gave me for water (first of all, the water tasted a little funky), which had some white greasy substance smeared on the side. Pretty gross. Unfortunately, I didn't notice until I had finished and was about to leave.",

So, we took a cozy little corner booth since we were at a Curry Corner. It took some time for a server to come by, and we ordered a wrap and the vegetable thali. After another stretch of time the server came by again saying they didn't have the wraps available today. So, the chicken keema ended up being the alternative choice.   It took a loooong time for our meals to get served to us, but they did look delectable. My vegetable thali plate had lentil/dal, spinach/palak, vegetable handi, chikpeas/chole, with a generous heap of rice and a piece of freshly baked naan. I enjoyed all the dishes on my plate and the naan was a good balance of crisp outer layer with soft inner portion. The rice was well cooked, nice and fluffy. I also had a bite of the chicken keema which seemed a bit bland to me.   I had asked for a soda but since service was nearly non-existent and I was doubting I would even get any refills if I had gotten my drink we asked them to take it off our bill once we went up to the register to pay.   Since it took so long, I probably won't be back. I did enjoy the food but there are other Indian restaurants in Tempe with better service with equally tasty dishes!",

I will say, good stuff [re: ordering through Grubhub, at least] - the price is really good for take-out, basically the lowest per-item price in Tempe itself for Indian restaurants  - that low price also includes naan or plain basmati  - I didn't have any problems with my order being wrong; it was exactly what I ordered, available by the estimated time  - the actual space is small enough that there's really no possible confusion on where your order would be / where the cash register is  - the food was pretty good!   It's less that I thought the food wasn't especially good so much as, it was just slightly disappointing? E.g. I got vegetable handi, whose description includes cauliflower, but it was very little cauliflower and mostly peas, potato, and large pieces of carrot.   Also, and this is value-neutral, but the food was way spicier/hotter than I expected, and I'm not sure if that's my own weird white American bias or if the food was legitimately spicier than you generally get at [primarily] north Indian places.",

Want a knife to cut your meat?You've gotta ask for that. They'll bring you a butter knife but that's all you need since the meat is always moist and will fall apart on its own. Most of the time, even on busy nights, there is one server and one cook. Hence the wait for everything. But it's really really affordable. Yes, I'll be back.

I've been coming here since 2011 and there's no other restaurant I've ate at more than here (except for Chipotle and Chic-Fil-a) during my time as an undergrad. I do miss their old prices but am very happy they have expanded.  Food is still amazing as always. I've tried almost everything except for the vegetarian list and a few other items. The yogurt mango lassi is delicious - sweet, creamy consistency, and refreshing. The chicken Tikka Masala with rice and garlic naan is a must - I've heard it's not made like \"traditional\" ways, but I've tried multiple takes of this at various of different restaurants (maybe it depends what region of Indian you compare it to? this version is absolutely the best). The chicken tikka masala has a perfect mix of Indian spice in a tomato base and cream. I always love it when they add an extra kick to it. You can ask for extra meat (not sure if they charge though. I've never paid attention).  Other things to get are the mixed grilled sizzler is. This is good as well, especially if you're really big on meat portions. I usually get lamb briyani every now and then. Honestly, I can go on for days! The service is not over the top amazing, but they're good people. However, everything on the menu will rock your taste buds.",

I then notice a small dining area next to the kitchen door with a separate entrance.  Having the kitchen door open to the customers has me nervous as it's entrance literally comes from the street. That alone would have dropped it to 4 stars, but I would like to point out that they messed up my order - I had ordered Chicken Korma and Chicken Tikki Masala and they gave me something that was not Chicken Korma and the Tikki Masala was quite watered down.  Almost as if they forgot how much to put in it and only used water to season it.",

We often eat curry and have been to numerous Indian and Pakistani restaurants throughout the US and overseas and Curry Corner was by far the worst restaurant we've ever dined at. The food is mediocre at best and the service is extremely slow. We spent over 2 hours  there and the majority of the time was spent waiting for our food. It took more than 10 minutes for the waiter to bring water! Not to mention we waited more than 45 minutes for our halwa to be brought to us (which by the way was pre-made and only had to be microwaved).   While we were there we observed a family of 4 walk out and leave before their food had a chance to arrive. Additionally, we overheard a customer complain about the food, which was apparently so bad she wasn't even willing to try another item on the menu and wanted to pay and leave.   If you prefer to spend your money at an establishment with poor food, below average service and questionable cleanliness then Curry Corner is probably the place for you. I personally will not be returning to this establishment and will caution friends and associates against it.",

A few times the server looked at us. Rather than asking if we needed anything he just went around empty tables to set napkins. Then a new group of people came in and they were  sat down and immediatley asked if they needed water and given a menu....after we have been sitting there for about 20 minutes with no service. They are very selective with how they treat their customers. The food here is amazing but the people of the facility are terrible. I've never experienced this in any resturaunt ever in my life.

Upon the recommendation of one of our kind followers we headed over to this suspicious looking restaurant for some spectacular food.  We got there pretty close to closing time but the service was still exceptional and they made us feel welcomed and helped us to choose the three dishes.  Most people might know that Guy Fieri showcased this spot on his show but we were unaware until the waiter mentioned it.  He proceeded to recommend the top three dishes that were ordered and enjoyed by Guy, all three of which we dined on as well.  The Tikka Masala was like a party of flavors in my mouth.  The heat from the spices wasn't overpowering but nice and welcoming.  The chicken was moist and there was tons of sauce, perfect for dipping the naan in to.  Processed with VSCOcam with f2 presetNext we dug into the fresh Goat Karahi, our first time eating goat and it was easily likeable.  I did feel that there were more bones in this dish than meat, which was too bad because the meat and the flavors of ginger, garlic and yogurt were delicious.  To take home (because we were enjoying the food so much) we ordered the Tandoori Chicken Tikka.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauce that came with it was a great combination.  Corner to try out some more dishes and to eat the Tikka Masala and naan again.",

As an American who grew up in a traditional midwest household, my tolerance for spicy food is extremely low. My husband is from India, however, and needs spice in his meals -- so this place used to be perfect for us because I could get mild dishes.   I don't know if the management has changed or what, but today when we were there we were told that all of the food is pre-made and they cannot make anything without red chili. The only option is to pour creme into a pre-made dish to try to dilute it. I have never had this happen at a restaurant before and was absolutely shocked to learn all of the food is pre-made spicy here. Cooking indian food at home and having half of a family that's indian, I know it is very simple and possible to make non-spicy food without the use of creme--it's done by not using so much red chili.   Honestly, the easy answer to appeal to more customers here is to make all food mild and add heat to it based on a customers preferences instead of making it all spicy.   So while our family all enjoyed lunch, I was not able to eat because I am 8 months pregnant and cannot have spicy food. I prefer vegetarian food and the only non-spicy veg they had was palak paneer which is full of creme.",

Just FYI, though, you might want to bring your own water if you're ordering anything that is at all spicy, because the servers seem pretty busy and don't do refills or any other kind of interaction, besides taking your order (it will probably take them 10-15 minutes to get to you for that). We've had multiple experiences where our water glasses have been empty for the whole meal, even after we've asked for refills. Also, don't expect anyone to come check on you - if you need something, ask multiple people!  In short, great food for good prices, with poor service.

Since I had chicken twice that day already, I wanted to order a beef dish. The guy at the counter told me that they were out of beef.  Then I decided to order the most popular dish the \"Chicken Tikka Masala.\"      It was a different kind of Indian/Pakistani dish that I am used to. Usually these kind of dishes are heavy, but this dish was very light, but flavorful at the same time.  The Naan bread was different as well. It was a lot lighter and fluffier then the usual Naan bread; the rice was pretty good too.  We ended up paying about $10 bucks a person. I would like to pay a little toward the $7-$8 range for this kind of place because they don't serve you, but $10 is ok.   Overall I would recommend this place if you are looking for a change of pace when it comes to Indian/Pakistani food, and want something lighter, but flavorful at the same time.",

When we walked in, there were a bunch of people standing awkwardly in the door and then someone came by to seat us. The table was dirty, so the man quickly wiped it, but there were still crumbs all over it. It took about 10 minutes just to get drinks(a water and a coke). I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and it was trashed. While waiting for food, the phone kept ringing loudly for several minutes with no one answering it.            I got the Aloo Tikki first after about 15 minutes. It had small black specs and crumbles on it, which I wiped off. The favor was decent. The outside of the patties was luke warm, but the inside was definitely cold. The Palak paneer was decent flavor wise as well, but it only had 4 paneer cubes in the whole dish. My SO got the chicken and rice. The flavor of the chicken was really good but I got a gangly piece was was turned off from eating more chicken. I'm not sure what is used to flavor the rice, since after a few bites I couldn't justify taking the rest home(which I am very much against throwing food away if I can help it). I enjoy trying new foods, so I am used to ethnic flavors, but something wasn't right about the chicken and rice.          My SO and I did agree that the Naan was really good. Unfortunately, I don't think that is enough for a sit down return (maybe just take out for the naan). I was so disappointed with this experience, since I was expecting it really good based on reviews and the pretty attractive pictures on the website.",

I'd eat it again too but the wait for the meal was really long and when you have a lunch break they need to move a bit faster on the food. We had to scarf it down and couldn't finish because of time. It took us nearly 30 min to get our meal and it wasn't packed when we ordered it as we were the first to arrive. If the service had been better I could give them a 4 star review but it wasn't. I'd still try it again though, just don't know when with other curry places in the city.",

We moved here from a small town (he is originally from southern India) and we were excited to see so many different restaurants with culture and flavor. We have been to Curry Corner twice and have eaten the samosas, tikka masala, lamb biryani, chicken makhani and aloo tikki. We have had these dishes with both rice and naan and on both visits the food was excellent! The portions aren't huge, but we have had leftovers each time, and they don't overprice. The service provided by the wait staff has been very friendly and prompt. The decor and seating leave something to be desired but the food itself was great. We will return and soon!!",

I usually order goat/lamb Karachi with Tawa paratha and hardly ever have I been disappointed and I have been eating here since 2013. Service is quick and quicker during lunch. Price is set for students and so 12 dollars will get you two meals worth of food.

We were a family of 5 and could not enjoy our food because the naan kept getting finished. Resulting in Shawn getting very loud with us and threatening to call the cops on us. all we did is ask him if he could please bring our final two naans so we could finish dinner. Then he packed the two naans and told us he had it ready for us to take home . My 6 year old and 3 year old were in tears begging him not to call the cops. And what was the reason?! Because he was telling us he gave us SUPERIOR customer service. And when we nicely told him it would have been fine to bring our naans together at once he started getting loud. Also I'm Pakistani so beware if you go to this restaurant because they will not treat you like a customer.

(Not that there's anything wrong with that!)  I will say that my (meat-eating) companions were not as enthusiastic about their dishes, but that has more to do with the fact that they don't really like curries and south Asian food, and less to do with Curry Corner specifically.  Also, service was a little slow and not terribly friendly. Oh, and the faucet in the men's restroom was leaking so much it was basically just On.

I have to say before that show has pointed me in the wrong direction, but I decided to try a variety of food I have never tasted before. I am soo glad that I did, this place was amazing, so much so that I literally told everyone about it and was there within a couple of days.  The third time was a little disappointing, we were forgotten a few times, and I totally get not having good days while waiting at tables. I've waited tables a majority of my life and some people on Yelp could really chill for a second and walk in a waitresses shoes; Just Sayin. Any how it was dead but they had been unexpectedly busy all day so I'm sure they were just beat. Any way I'd totally go back again, wish they had a location in Phoenix, if they did I'd support them more. Sadly the drive is way long for consistent visiting.",

I had take away so I can't comment on the service, but the girl who rang up my order was very welcoming and nice. Tip: Grab some craft beer or wine next door and you're good to go! haha",

If you like spicy food make sure to ask for it though! They keep it non-spicy unless you ask because there's a lot of wimpy white people who complain about it being too hot otherwise lol!",

I hesitantly went back tonight because my sister was dying for some home (Pakistani) food and this is the only good place in town.  I was surprised by how much the service has improved. They've hired a new girl there who definitely understands customer service, some of the previous employees seem to be much better as well. I dont know if it was just by chance, but the owner was there taking orders as well, I havent seen that since 2013, but maybe thats because my visits have declined since then. Either way it seems the owner is really involved now, the service is much better than before. Our food came in under 15 minutes or so, though I noticed some tables waited quite a while, still not a problem. Final words, food is as great as it used to be, my stomach was more than satisfied and finally after a couple of years I was satisfied and happy to have gone there, and didnt feel like I was bothering them with my presence.   Only reason I didnt give it a 5 star was because I just want to make sure its like this the next time I go in and that it wasnt just a fluke, also there was a huge water leak on one side of our table from the ceiling which I thought was actually funny more than it was annoying lol. I think the recent negative yelp reviews have gotten them to straighten up, or maybe they've done it on their own. Definitely recommend that you go here for Pakistani/Indian cuisine.",

When we arrived, the owner sat us at a dirty table and didn't even notice the debris. It was the gentleman who brought out our water later that seemed to be embarrassed by the mess and immediately wiped the table.   I got the vegetarian thali so that I could try a few different dishes at once, and my husband got the chicken tikka masala since it's a good \"comparison\" dish. Our food came out fairly quickly although my naan lagged behind a few minutes. At least it was fresh and hot though very plain. The dal and chickpeas were the standouts in my dish. Tons of flavor for something so simple. My husband was happy with his chicken. He said the meat was tender, and the sauce wasn't overwhelmed with cream like at other places. He was hoping for a bigger portion, but for the price, it was a good value. The basmati was decent, but we prefer the more spiced version from our usual place.  Service was really lacking though. We had to ask for water. My husband's entree didn't come with a plate. No one checked up on us after the food arrived. We had to ask for the check. We observed other patrons who got wrong orders or orders that were forgotten altogether. The misspelled t-shirts worn by the staff \"In Expensive Excellence\" really irked me too. I would try Curry Corner again, but I might stick to takeout.",

For instance their chicken tikka masala consistently tastes great, as well as their Karahi's and the Chicken Achari.   I've been a regular customer the last 10 years, back when Curry Corner occupied a storefront at the corner of Lemon Rd and Terrace and pre-food network fame when it was a go to for Indian international students living nearby. I'm happy that they've grown and have still retained their low prices, and the portions have stayed the same. I like their cheese naan, and the tawa paratha too. Definitely get yourself a mango lassi, it's so refreshing especially when it's warm out.",

It was so tender, falling apart and just awesome.  My wife got the hummus with beef and it was a surprise.  There was so much for the price and it was packed with flavor.

Normally Guy is pretty good with his choices but sometimes he can be off a bit.  Inside is rather small and appears to be a hit with the ASU students as well as the regulars who live or work nearby. There are two TVs that are always on and either playing the Food Network or a cheesy flick from overseas.  The menu has a several choices to pick from when ordering. Some are more Pakistani style while others are more of the standard favorites that you would see for this type of restaurant cuisine.  Started with a some appetizers. Ordered the Samosas with dipping sauces and on another visit some Aloo Tikki. Had to try what Guy had eaten so got the Goat Karahi with Garlic Naan and then came back again later in the week and tried the Tandoori Chicken Tikka.  They definitely got the flavors down but the portions seemed rather small. Really liked both the Goat and the Tandoori. Wish that you could order a larger version of the meals without having to pay for two dishes. I had asked if I could get the Tandoori with more chicken for an extra charge and I was told that was not an option. Hmmm?  Give them a try and make sure to fill up on the appetizers first so that you are not still hungry when you are finished. Prices are reasonable until you end up ordering more than what you were expecting. THAT'S MONEY!  3.25 STARS",

He did absolutely nothing to the table, it was filthy. Then he came back and instead of walking us to the table, handed my boyfriend the menus and told us we could go. Ok. Fine.   We ordered a diet soda, water and a mango lassi. Took 10 minutes to get water and soda. We waited another 10 minutes and we never saw the waiter/greeter/whatever he was again. Got up and left.

Recently I had a weekday off work and decided that was the day to go. They open at 11 and I arrived about a quarter past. The parking lot was empty at that time and I was unsure they were open. I went inside and I was the first customer of the day. The lady in the dining room was very nice and asked about drinks right away. The menu had a lot of good looking items, but I wanted to try something different. I asked about the nehari noor jehan, which was a dish from Pakistani. I didn't know how to pronounce it so I just pointed and said that one. She said it was very good. It arrived fairly quickly and came in a large dish with the marinated boneless beef and another plate with rice. She brought a third plate for me to combine the two. A lot of dishes for one person, but I wasn't washing them so I didn't mind. The plate was excellent. Great flavor, the beef was very tender, and the sauce was great. It was also a very large portion. If my wife would have been there we could have easily shared. As it was I left full and had almost a full box to take home. As I was there the place began to fill up as it moved closer to noon. I would definitely go back and try something else or even stick with that dish again.",

Unfortunately the experience was utterly disappointing this time. We ordered right after we were seated as we knew exactly what to order. Our order included 2 Tandoori Chicken Tikkas, one Reshmi kabob, one sizzling platter and one Tikka masala fries. The fries didn't take long to be served and they were okay. We had to wait for another 45 minutes for the rest of the food to be served. Upon my reminder, I was told that since we ordered all grilled menu items, it was taking long. I also reminded about how we were not even served water which was provided right after.  When our food was finally served and we started eating, we noticed that the quality and taste was not even close to how it was last time. Above all the Tandoori chicken Tikkas were raw from inside- something I wasn't all all expecting considering the amount of time it took to show up at the table. It seems like the owner doesn't come to the restaurant anymore and has made her kids and a couple of his college friends in-charge. The service and quality of the food used to be much better when she was here. It wasn't even that busy today otherwise I would have given them some benefit of the doubt. While paying for the meal, I complained about the rawness of the chicken so they 'graciously' didn't charge me for one order of chicken tikka. I did pay for the rest of the meal and even added 15% gratuity. I would strongly advise the owner to be managing/cooking herself if she wanted her loyal customers to keep coming to her restaurant.",

Upon receiving the food, we were all surprised by how oily/greasy our meals were. I order the Aloo Matar, and there was a good half inch of oil/grease floating on the top of it. We had out of town guests and our bosses at this meeting who'd never eaten Indian before, so we attempted to act like that was normal for Indian meals. 15 minutes after eating, every one of us was experiencing extreme stomach cramps. I literally had to drive home and change out of my too-tight-on-my-cramping belly pants. It was a terrible experience, and I don't recommend their food. :-/ I can't see how they were featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, but maybe we just got their food on a way off day!

The only negative about this place is how embarrassing it was to ask for the mountain of to go boxes because we weren't able to finish our delicious food that we refused to waste because it was so Devine.  Is this where I mention that I lived in India and know my Indian Food?? Lol  Don't miss this place!",

Not good.  Next visit was last Saturday night.  We explained how we were owed an order of Chicken Tikka Masala. No problem.  However, the naan arrived after we were finished with our meal, so we weren't sure what to do with it. Also, the wait staff had to be asked several times to refill our water glasses.  The food at Curry Corner is very tasty. However, the service and accuracy frustrations will keep me away.",

We went tonight at around 8pm to find the place very busy, and there was a steady flow of customers until we left too. But despite that, we were seated quickly and our food come out rather fast so no complaint there.  One thing I recommend everyone try is their cheese naan bread. It's divine, cooked with a filling of white cheese and topped with garlic butter and fresh cilantro. The next thing we enjoy is the Arabic plate we shared with a side of lamb tikka masala. Honestly, the Arabic plate plus 2 cheese naan breads were enough to fill my husband and I, and the curries they chose were perfectly seasoned. Our only personal dislike was the tikka masala because the sauce is a little on the sweeter side, although the lamb was cooked perfectly.   Equally important to food quality, this restaurant is priced very well. We can always get a good amount of food for cheaper compared to other places. Restaurant and bathrooms are also kept nice and clean.   All in all, Curry Corner has become our favorite stop for Indian food so far in Maricopa Valley, and to add to our good experience tonight, the table next to us very generously covered our bill but left before we could thank them. So, after coming back, I am sticking by my original 5-star review",

I typically order the Chicken Tikka Masala which is creamy and flavorful with tender chicken! You have your choice of normal Naan or rice. I typically order rice and get a side of garlic naan! Use the Naan to scrap every last bit of your meal. Yum!  Occasionally I'll order the mango Lassi. If you're new to Indian food this is a thick yogurt drink with mango flavor. It's very good but they usually fill me up so be sure to drink them slow so you have room for your meal.   The restaurant itself is in a not so appealing strip mall but the interior is nice and usually clean. Seating is open so feel free to pick a table and the staff with be with you shortly. They are usually very nice and the service is quick.",

Everytime I go I order chicken Tikka and it has been amazing. This time for the first time in 7 years it was horrible. So oily chicken was not fresh and tasted bad. Then came chicken handi which use to be tasty too but this time it was not cooked properly and onions felt raw. So we complained and the owner lady came in which I know for last 7 years . I honestly have her feedback on how food does not taste as it use to . So she took chicken handi with her inside and never came back . That felt insulting to me , if you are there to get the feedback and went inside atleast come out and say what you think what might have gone wrong indside. At the end she told her server to give 5% and then also she did not come out. I am like I am not here to get 5% discount on terrible food. I would pay full and be happy rather than take 5% off. The server took one chicken Tikka off from the system as he felt bad for the food we got . Imagine the server can understand but the owner cannot. This place should be shut down for the food they are serving and the audicity and attitude they have",

The naan that had cheese inside was so much better!  The place ran out of samosas (darn it!). Place was busy with customers and lots of to go orders too. That may have been why our server forgot the mango lassi despite 2 requests.  Food was very reasonably, inexpensively priced and we would come back again.",

    "text": "I think I hyped up Curry Corner too much in my head before visiting. I had been salivating over the photos of the masala fries for quiet sometime so I was thrilled to finally try them out. Sadly, my expectations were shattered in a bad way. The fries were cold by the time we received them and they were kind of soggy from the sauce. Also, I noticed they were missing the green garnish that is shown in lot of other photos.   Service was spotty from the start. It took a while for us to be sat. Then, it took a while for the food to come out and finally, it took a long while to pay the bill. For some unknown reason, all of the staff seemed to be back in the kitchen area. So glad we came on a weekend and did not need to be anywhere in a rush because the visit took much longer than necessary.   When our food did come out, we were brought two plates when we had only ordered one. This lead to an awkward conversation trying to explain that we only ordered one. However the waitress proceeded to tell us that we had ordered two. Mistakes do happen but arguing with customers about it does not make the situation any better.   Our waitress also never asked what spice level we wanted and some of the vegetarian plate was a little spicier than I would have preferred. Towards the end of the meal the owner/manager came by to check on us which was appreciated but a little too late.   Overall the food was okay but due to the service I don't think I'll be back.",

What I saw as I approached the door to enter was a run down strip center restaurant. No different once inside. The walls haven't been painted, repaired and maybe cleaned in 10-20 years. The floors are dirty, the booth seating lumpy, and the plates have been through the dishwashers a million times. Then my chicken tikki masala arrives luke warm, at best. At least the cheese naan arrived hot and delicious. Could not summon the appetite to try anything more due to the grungy surroundings. Did Guy Fieri really come to this dive? Why? Anyway, I won't be returning. There are many other Indian restaurants in cleaner, better inviting condition with good food. My advice to you is to try one of those instead.",

    "text": "I started going here about 5 months ago when a friend who lives right near it said it was pretty good.  I do not eat nonkosher meat or poultry, so I was delighted when I saw they have a good amount of fish options with Talapia.  My favorite by far is the fish biryani (fish cooked with rice and a ton of herbs and seasonigns) served with a side of yogurt.  It is absolutely phenomenal and cheap considering the portion size.  I think it costs like 8 dollars.  The amount of seasonings and herbs is what really makes the dish taste so good.    I have also tried the fish curries.  They are pretty good, but I much prefer the Biryani.  My GF usually orders a curry,either fish or vegetable, and she also loves it.  We also order the samosas on occasion, which have a great flavor.  The Naan is also delicious, but I have never really had \"bad\" naan at an indian/paki restuarant, so i do not think that having great naan is a special benefit - rather, if you dont have great naan, i wont be going to the restaurant!  The service is usually slow, but getting better as the restaurant becomes more professional.  I hope they dont lose the home style cooking or low prices as a result of becoming more of a \"real\" restaurant.    Also, Guy Fieri ate there recently for his DDD show and I am very excited to see it!",

First off, don't be turned off by the crummy strip mall it's in, or the Tempe trash that loiters around outside scratching at their coke bugs... or the fact that u-turns and left-hand turns are a pain in the ass off of Apache due to this light-rail set-up - you must open your mind!  The guy working tonight was either the owner or son of the owner or something but he KNEW customer service.  He was welcoming, friendly, informative... diligent with cleaning up, taking and bringing orders AND answering the myriad of questions I threw out at him (like \"is the lamb leg or shoulder... are the bones included...?\")  This guy knew his food (we shared our goat meat sources and cooking tips) and described everything in a very detailed way.  I sure wasn't asking lots of questions to be picky.. no, in fact I was wanting to learn how this $9 goat dish I had was having such an effect on me... OOF!  BEST friggin $9 I've spent so far this year!!!  I could eat this all day!  Out from the kitchen where a Pakistani woman was cooking came a size-able stainless steel container with this wonderfully aromatic, succulent goat meat in tomato and garam masala stew... it was fantastic!  I love that they used the fat renderings with the garam masala to make this *heavenly* soupy deliciousness that was plentiful in the little container.... damn, I'm salivating just remembering it all over again.  SO, check out this place.  The guy was awesome but what stood out the most was their flavorful goat dish... the goat being the stand-out!   My sister's Chicken Tikka was also super flavorful, but mine was definitely more complex and interesting... now i just need another excuse to go to Tempe so I can relive this!",

Some of the chicken especially small pieces were so overlooked and tough it wasn't enjoyable   Main Lamb Kahari , rice and plain Nan Bread. This was special, nice spice to it but not overwhelming, tasted so fresh and the lamb was cooked perfectly . Nan was also baked to perfection , just a bit crispy . A bit too much rice in relation to the main dish though ( not a complaint, just a preference)  Plan on going again   Dropped 1 star for the Pakora, everything else was class",

    "text": "Food is as good as ever, but we are docking another star because of the service this time. We came in a bit after dinnertime, and it turned out to be pretty full despite the late hour. We ordered a straightforward meal, but either the server or the kitchen got confused and didn't communicate. The waiter was nice and listened when we told him we didn't get our naan but it still took forever because everyone was confused. We don't know whose fault it was but when they finally figured it out they brought it to us as we were finishing so we had to wrap it up and take it home when we wanted to eat it WITH our meal. Even after all of that, they didn't pay attention and overcharged us and added an entire entree that we didn't order into our check. So we had to walk back in and have them refund us and we had to pay again. Needless to say, we were exhausted at the end and didn't have the usually pleasant experience we were expecting.",

It was like chili fries but with an indian twist. I thought it was very interesting and was certainly delicious.  Later on I got the chicken curry while my babe got the chicken makhani. They were both delicious, but the best part was the fresh-baked naan that came with it.. We only ordered one serving but they gave us so many. They were perfectly crisp and yet moist so delicious.  If you are in Phoenix you NEED to come try this place out!",

Seekh Kabob and chapli kabob were not very flavorful and the size of the serving seems to have shrunk. The chana puri combo was abysmal. The chana dish was watery and for the Puri, they seemed to have used the naan batter and fried it, so the Puri was more like fried naan! Looks like the only thing they seem to do OK with are chicken items.  I have given them enough chances and won't be returning.",

Didn't bring us the bill  for 20 minutes and when we asked for the bill they were just like \"you pay up front.\" No sign saying that.

    "text": "Me and my wife have been a frequent visitor of Curry Corner in Tempe for about a year. In our initial visits the food was very good in quality and also was enough in quantity to justify the price. However, our last two visits has left us seriously considering if we should ever come back here again. In our visit before last, we ordered a chicken tikka plate, which previously used to come with two pretty big size of chicken pieces, enough to satisfy two people. However this time we were surprised to see how small the size of the piece has gotten. Along with that the quality of the spices and in terms of the way it was cooked, was just very poor. We thought that it might have been just a bad day for us, and we should give it another try. We tried Curry Corner again tonight, and ordered a  Mid Sizzler platter, and were surprised beyond belief when we got three small cubes of chicken, with one kabob piece, and a small chicken tikka piece in the whole platter! Initially this platter used to have three times more content. The small cubes of chicken were so hard to chew and we could easily tell that they were not fresh or made the same day. Infact, after coming home me and wife both got sick, and had an upset stomach! Is this a new management change you have had? Please get back to your old quality and quanity of food other wise you will loose your customers! Thank you.",

I've had tandoori chicken, chicken Tikka masala, kababs and chicken biryani here. My wife liked their Tikka masala and the tandoori chicken is a hit or miss. The biryani was terrible, no flavor and texture of the rice was gooey. The kababs were not fresh and chicken was too hard.   Take out is never delivered on time, but they will tell you 25 mins for pick up. Knowing they were late the first time, I went after 35 mins of ordering and my food wasn't ready. When asked to check on status, the server looked at me like I asked him to add me to his will.   They always seem to have only 1 guy running all the tables, take outs, closing checks, taking orders, etc. This will be my last trip to this place.   Ambiance: 2 Food: 2 Service: 2",

Food arrived fresh, hot and was well packaged.   The chicken tikka masala was extremely oily - not something you commonly see in this dish. The heat was absolutely non existent and I couldn't taste any of the other spices that are common in most Indian dishes. It was heavily under salted as well. It really just tasted like some chicken in a bland tomato sauce.  The garlic naan was brushed with way too much oil and there was way too much raw garlic on top. I'm a garlic lover but this was just awful.  All in all, I'd pass on this place. There are many delicious Indian restaurants in Scottsdale/Tempe but this isn't one of them.",

I've been here dozens of times. The food takes me back to some of the Pashtun food I ate when I was in the Paktika Province of Afghanistan, the flavors are so rich and hearty.  When you come here you have to order the Tikka Masala fries, they're crazy good!!!   My favorite dishes are the Goat Haleem and the Karahi, omg they are so rich in flavor and the stew in the Goat Haleem is addictive! Their rice is always very good, as is their naan (if you like garlic their garlic naan is amazing).   I've also had their chicken tikka masala which is really good but they make goat so good here that it's usually what I always order. As long as Curry Corner is open, I'll be a patron.  Thank you Curry Corner!!!",

I felt like it took a long time for the waitress to come take our drink order.  We ordered cheese and garlic naan, Afghani Boti and chicken achari with rice on the side.  Everything was very delicious.  We loved dipping our naan bread in the sauce of the Afghani Boti dish.  So much flavor and good spice!  Also- the cheese naan is amazing.  Skip the garlic naan and just order two of the cheese naan so good!  The reason I am giving 3.5 stars is because I feel like the restaurant needs a good deep cleaning done.  Our table, table #2, had food splatters all over the wall, and on the table # and even on napkins which were tucked on the side.  It grossed us out and doesnt leave a good impression.  Even the menus could use a good wipe down.  I really hope the owner of staff sees this and schedules a good cleaning... the food is so good But its not enjoyable when you question how clean or not clean the kitchen might be based off of the way the walls look at your booth.",

I ordered the Chicken Makhani, under the recommendation by our server because I asked what is the least spicy. Before the recommendation, I asked if I could have the tikka masala non-spicy. (Dumb me! Indian food uses one base, so I can't change that lol) I got my food pretty fast, considering I was with a party size of 10. I was very happy with the flavors of my dish. Even though it was spicy, the creamy sauce and garlic really came through for me. I ate all of my food plus some of my family members. I found the naan super delicious as well! It was freshly made and well seasoned.   Our server was nice and accommodated our large group with ease.  I recommend this place if you are looking for something different on the dinner table. It's not a usual cuisine I usually choose, but when I do, I always seem to enjoy it!",

I tasted a small amount of the sauce before attempting to eat it and after drinking a glass of water my mouth still feels like it's on fire.. wtf. I don't know why anyone would ever make food that spicy especially when I asked for it mild. I couldn't get anyone else to eat the food so I threw it out. It's scary when restaurants can't follow simple requests, imagine if someone had an allergy. Avoid this place.",

Samosas- we ordered 2 orders and inside them still cold.  2. Chicken makhani - the dark meat chicken was over cooked, too much water and it's look like has been couple days they just added more water over and over again. Would not recommend!  3. Fish curries - the fish was awful. All we can taste a strong onion covered entire curry sauce and the fish.  4. Garlic Naan - the garlic naan was good    I would strongly never recommend this place!!!",

I am so glad we did and was not disappointed whatsoever. Since I have no knowledge of what any of the foods would be or taste like or the names of the dishes I relied heavily on yelp reviews and Google searches. I completely fell in love with the bread or Naan. You can get it in many different ways plain, with potato or with cheese. We tried them all and they all were equally delicious. Next time we would go only for the plain as we used it to dip in hummus and to eat with chicken. We even tried their sweet drink which consists of yogurt and fruit. It was not too sweet and very delicious.  We received our food quickly fresh and hot. I would definitely recommend knowing what you would like to try beforehand because the waitress was not very helpful with the menu especially if you're like us and have no clue on what you are about to eat.  Everything was delicious and if I had a place like this close to home I would go more often.",

We have had take out here once before that wasn't great but tolerable.  Tonight our samosas were cold in the middle and the Palak paneer and aloo paneer tasted like tomato paste and peas with no spice.   The chole dish I had was ok, but my friends food came out nearly 30 minutes after mine and it was awful.  We also didn't get our garlic naan until almost the end of the meal and it was flavorless.  They did apologize for the food and the \"new\" cook and did end up comping our meal, kudos to them for that.   But we did leave hungry and disappointed.  Definitely will not be returning.  Next time will be sure to make reservations in time at The Dhaba!",

All the curry was delicious and it had the perfect amount of spice to it, just enough to make you reach for the water but not too much that you lose the taste of the food. The naan was delicious and the portions were perfect for sharing with the whole party. I think we had the chicken makhani, chicken tikka masala, one of their goat specials, and the vegetarian thali plate which was a big sample plate of a bunch of different foods. Oh and it doesn't get better than only paying around $8 per person and being so full you can barely move.

And I'm please to report that the service this time,unlike almost every visit before, was very professional.   I'm not a college student and won't just be 'ok' with any kind of service. Maybe college students aren't either.  She was attentive, took my order promptly, brought everything I needed to the table, and checked on me 2-3 times during the course of my solo dining.  Very well done indeed.  I just hope they can keep up this level of service because it matches their food now!  Nuff said.",

Fall off the bone meat with a spiciness that I loved. The boyfriend had the (Chicken Tikki Masala), he was done before I could get a bit, so that speaks for it self. For appetizer we had a the (Samosas) and (Tandoori Wings) and we pretty much inhaled both. Yeah inhaled. They took a bit longer to make due to the cooking process but definitely worth the wait. Service was good. Not great. She did the job while juggling seven other tables but I'm a server as well and she knew how to handle this restaurant. When the bill came, I choked a bit because I thought we got under charged. Nope. The food is amazing. It's nothing simple but it will leave you taking a to-go menu and craving more. We'll be back. Yes we will.",

I was charged 30%!!!of my final bill as a reservation fee for reserving a table for 6 for Friday evening( we showed up before time). Like I said, we are regulars at this place and this was the first time in 7 years I was hearing about this reservation fee. Moreover, the guy(looks Mexican but could be Midle eastern) who rudely and very firmly told me about this reservation fee acted like a total jerk!!...dude you are supposed to  provide customer service and be polite....you don't work for the IRS!! I asked for a high chair for my  daughter and the same guy simply showed me the place where it is kept..as if..go get it from there..seriously!!! I have known the faimly running this place for past several years..very nice people..I  hope they are reading this review. Please make your policy clear about the reservation fee..and please give some training to your staff to be polite and to actually provide customer service.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to Curry Corner this evening for our 18th anniversary. We chose Curry Corner based on a recommendation from a coworker who happens to be Pakistani. We live on the other side of the valley but often frequent restaurants on the East side. I have to say that Curry Corner was worth the drive.  The food and service at this restaurant was top notch. I ordered the vegetarian thali plate which was a combination of a few vegetable curries along with lentils (daal), basmati rice, yogurt and naan (bread). The curries were very flavorful and cooked well. The heat level was not too high but the waiter said they could be spiced to your liking. Next time! My wife ordered the shrimp tikka masala. Being a vegetarian I did not sample the dish entirely but I do admit I did taste the sauce. The masala sauce was flavorful, rich and not very spicy. I forgot to mention that we started the meal with samosas and a hummus plate. Hummus is not something I usually see at an Indian restaurant, but it was fantastic! It was served with their awesome naan. I have to say that the prices of this place were extremely reasonable. I really cannot wait until we can go back to Curry Corner. If you like Indian or Pakistani food, hurry up and head over to Curry Corner.",

The goat was great. I like eating goat when it is offered in a place like this and it didn't disappoint. I took it as it came, and it had a nice flavorful spice to it but not overly hot. You need to pick up the bones and chew and suck out the remaining little bits of meat and juice. If this bothers you, don't get it. The nan was good too. A  good meal for 1 hungry person or very light for 2. The rest of the menu looked very good and people seed to be enjoying their meals. A medium sized crowd but it was early. The only thing that could have been better was the iced tea. Not bad, not great. I would definitely come back . The whole meal was $12 and change.",

However, Curry Corner is a happy exception.   Almost everything I have eaten here  (4 or so visits), has been really good.  I really liked their samosas, chicken tikka, lamb biryani, dal, and saag paneer.  I didn't care too much for the channa masala or the murgh achari. Also, their naan is awesome, they are hands down the best I've had in the valley!   The staff members are polite and many of them take care to ensure their customers are having an enjoyable experience.  The service is typically quick, but when its busy the service does lag.  Its not unusual to see people awkwardly standing by the door waiting to be seated.  But once a staff member comes to seat you, you're set since they are very accommodating in making room to seat waiting patrons.  If you want to eat South Asian food in Tempe this is the place to go, they have quality food and reasonable prices.",

It took 30 minutes before anyone was able to get us drinks. They need more help there as well, the phone was ringing off the hook and the guy working there had no urgency whatsoever.",

They were double fried and so crispy they all but shattered when you looked at them, but doused in delicious sauce and feta cheese. I'm pretty sure I could have eaten that and called it an entire meal. The garlic naan wasn't as garlicky as I could have hoped, but it was tasty anyways. All of the rest of the food was delicious, and the service was friendly. Only thing I was missing was the little dish of spices on the way out the door. It always helps settle my stomach after a heavy meal. Nice big parking lot here, which is great right off campus.",

Finally, the owner lady asked us to sit down with such an attitude as if she is doing a huge favor to us.The lady would talk so nicely about the food and stuff to our non asian neighbors but would never bother coming to us to take our order or even to hand us the menu(btw this has happened to us twice on separate occasions) Wow lady!!..were we not paying or what?? This is not the racist land where you came from and we are not college students who would not react to this kind of mean and rude service. The water took 20 minutes to arrive...don't even wanna talk about the other female server...she is just going through her shift. I grew up eating this kind of food so you can take it from me, seriously it's not that great..they use chicken thigh meat in all curries which is not always a good thing...portions sizes are ridiculously small...nothing interesting really...there are much better and courteous places around. I seriously hope that their \"Guy Fiery\" bubble bursts soon. I am not going back again at any cost...and would highly recommend all of you to stay away..specially if you are an asian.",

And get this--- she doesn't even offer you a straw as she serves you with it. You would have to go get the straw from their counter. I don't get that..  I mean she is already serving the drink, why wouldn't she serve the straw as well. The only redeeming thing is that their price is super cheap for the amount and quality of the food that you get.

    "text": "I visited this place last night with a mate after otherwise unsuccessfully attempting to eat other places. I am glad, considering this place is great.  We shared a vegetarian thali and samosas. It came with yogurt, gobi aloo, masoor dal, palak paneer, chana masala, onion, rice in the centre, and naan on the side. We asked for extra naan. Their naan was quite fluffy and thick compared to other places that I have eaten from, or especially when compared to grocery market purchased naan. All of it was very flavourful. I was really impressed with the spices on the chick peas, especially. Their palak paneer was a very smooth combination of the paneer and spinach flavours. The gobi aloo's identity eluded me at first because i had trouble figuring out that the cauliflower on top was upside down. The spices did not overpower the buttery nature of the cauliflower and were well accented with potato. Neither of us are onion fans, and both of us prefer our yoghurt sweet, so we took no liking to those small sides, although they were obviously less important than the curries. The masoor dal had an appealing milkiness to it. Their samosas were extremely good, with no lack in filling. There was nothing above mild spiciness on our plate, which was of no consequence to either of us as everything was hugely savory.  As far as the eating environment inside, the place is quite small and it seems to be in an otherwise relatively suspicious lot. I found it cozy. They do not wait on you. The menu is right above the order window. They do bring out your food to you, so there is no need to pick it up. They will do take out. The staff are all very friendly. You serve yourself water from a small stand with cups and pitchers. The minimal decorations are pretty and not overbearing, although most of Curry Corner's atmosphere seems to come from its customers keeping the place busy.  I ordered mango lassi on the way out. It is thicker than most I have had and instead of being blended with ice, it has ice cubes in it to chill it, but it was still delicious. It also lasted overnight in the fridge and still tasted good the next day.",

So, if you don't know what you want, and can't see the wall from where you're sitting, then you'll have to go look.  They didn't have actual menus, but we didn't find that to be any big deal.    I had the chicken tikka masala with rice & added a garlic naan. It was SO fresh & tasty. My husband had the mixed grill and really liked his as well. We will definitely be back.

I really don't get why it's always so busy in there. There are way better restaurants near by. Only reason I used to go was because it's the only halal place near by.

Meanwhile, the owners keep messaging me to get me to delete my review.  Oh Curry Corner.  I loved you since the day I met you.  Your takeout orders were usually wrong.  But I forgave you, for each time I came inside, my food was just right.  I was wierded out by your self-service beverages, and your water always tasted so awful that I drank tea or soda.  I figured it was a ploy to sell drinks, and I was OK with that, because your food was so cheap and so delicious.  I was excited to come in last week to find Guy Fieri's visit (can't stand the dude...wtf is with his hair...SERIOUSLY) prompted a major renovation.  Gone were the mostly disgusting and crappy booths near the kitchen.  Hardly an improvement to remove booths and replace with tables and chairs, but this was.  They cleaned it up. And it looked great!  Well, I was pumped that my friend, who is mostly an Indian food virgin, enjoyed this place and his first foray to the cuisine.  So much so, that (well, until he reads this review) I couldn't bear to tell him what I saw when we checked out.  A roach.  Not a dead one.  One still clinging to it's life.  Legs in the air like he just didn't care.  I immediately bugged (ha!) my friend who had originally turned me on to the place to tell him my woeful tale of a roach at Curry Corner.  OH, he said?  I saw one the last time I was there, but I assumed it was just a fluke.  No.  It was not.  And no thanks, CC.  I'm over you.",

    "text": "I first came here in 2014 and I thought the food was pretty good, however when I ordered take-out about a month later they totally skimped on the amount of paneer and since I loathe dishonestly I vowed not to come again. However since I am employed at the University and often dine with co-workers who wish to come here, I have been here two additional times, once in late 2015 and once this month (2016).  In 2015: 1) My food was mediocre 2) One guy was acting as host/waiter and was extremely rude 3) Food took forever to come out even through they weren't busy 4) My coworker's specialty drink never came  On the most recent trip things were even worse.  1) My dish was terrible 2) One woman was acting as hostess/waitress so no one was in front-of-the-house for 5 minutes while we waited to be seated 3) My coworker's meal was below average for such a popular dish; and the chicken in the curry was fatty 4) It took 15 min. for water to arrive and was never refilled and we were not given napkins (had to get up to get them ourselves)  5) One sauce on the table was extremely low and the was other dirty (they had just opened) 6) Coworker's tea came out about 40 minutes after being seated and tasted more like cream than tea.  It appears that the owner's of Curry Corner are trying to ride the Diner's Drive-ends and Dives wave from 2013 while cutting corners and pushing out poor food and shitty service post-production.",

    "text": "Where do I start? Perhaps from the time when I first gave them a call to confirm they are open before coming in?  It was close to 3.30pm on a Saturday and I called the restaurant to confirm that they are open before driving 15 minutes to come here. I asked \"Hi.. Are you open now?\" The guy, with a perplexed tone responds \"Why?\"  Whyyyy??? Whyyyyyyy?? Really? That was the first red flag to turn away. But I didn't because I wanted to give them a second chance.  They got us seated right next to the entrance where tons of people were walking by. It was annoying, so we asked the waiter to move us to another booth at the far end of the restaurant.  He said he'll accomodate our request after cleaning up the table. We waited, waited and waited. 15 minutes passed. The other table was not cleaned yet. And nobody came to our table to take our order. Everytime we tried to flag somebody down to take our order, we heard \"Just one minute\".. Several minutes passed and nobody showed up to take our order.  Finally, we noticed that the other table that we wanted to move to, had been cleaned. So, we just walked over and told the waiter \"We are going there\".  And then waited for another 10-15min before some guy came by to take our order. We got Tikka Fries, Chicken Curry, Chicken Tikka Naan, Garlic Naan and Veggie Biriyani.  The chicken tikka naan was terrible. Likewise, the garlic naan. There was hardly any garlic on it.  The chicken curry was mediocre at best. While serving the veggie biriyani, the waiter said \"Here's your chicken vegetable biriyani\". We went \"Woah woah wait.. Is it chicken or veggie biriyani. We ordered veggie, and you said it was chicken veggie biriyani\". His response \"No no, this is veggie biriyani\". IDIOT  After requesting for water (without ice) multiple times, we were served water with ice. And obviously we told him \"We asked for water without ice\". He says \"Oh ok, sorry\" and leaves the glasses right there.  Made a mistake by ordering salted lassi and yeah, you could clean your bathroom with whatever they got. It was not lassi and it was inedible.",

It's the real deal. The Goat Karai is in the top 5 dishes I've EVER had. I mean, it's off the charts. We tried about 5 different dishes and EVERY dish was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bomb.com&s=165e7bb2ac34fd18b8371bbe4efa558dbcc7c8b105beeb4adb2846e1d3faf1d4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. If you're looking for a \"high end\" place to eat, this isn't it. It's a college dive that's frequented by students. It's a well taken care of place that delivers on quality food, period. If you want a great meal, this is it. My only complaint, the water is horrible. It's awful. We had to purchase their bottled water. It would make sense to add some sort of filtration system to their water supply. But they get to sell bottled water because of the awful tap water, so from a business standpoint, I get it.",

And literally the next day, or later that day (don't judge), they will take our order and 20 minutes later we find out the they forgot to put it in and we'd have to reorder (there's one specific guy but I don't wanna put him on blast).   It's totally worth it though. Just don't come here on your lunch break or you may have to try to convince your friends that an Indian restaurant is to blame for your getting fired. Trust me. Just kidding. But not really.  If you don't want to be a mainstream bandwagon loser and get the chicken tikka masala like everyone else at your table I'd suggest the hara masala or palak murg.   It would be a game changer if they had a buffet doe",

The curry looks great but I was really feeling the Tandoori chicken so I went for the sizzler player. The beef kabobs were good with a nice spice mix but the two offered was enough for me, the consistency was off. It seemed like it was ground beef made into a patty? The Tandoori chicken and the other option, don't remember name was both very moist, with quite a bit of heat to them, and really delightful.   Hubby ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala. I enjoyed it enough, he didn't like it at all. I think the waitress misunderstood his request for the spiciest menu item as it had none and the mix of spices especially the mint and yogurt didn't sit well with either of us.... He finished MAYBE half.  We also ordered the garlic naan and later on the hummus as the naan had absolutely no flavor, nothing like the one we enjoy from the store even, so we needed a dip to get through it. The hummus however was amazing and very garlicky.    Overall it was ok, we are from out of town so if in the area again we would opt to try a different eatery",

From the other reviews, the waitstaff seem to be stretched, or unresponsive, or something else.  This may be because we were coached from a long time ago to leave a table tip in cash -- not on the iPAD at the counter.  Why?  Because there would be no tip!  If this were not True, why would the waitstaff so advise?  They would have nothing really to gain.  Sure enough, after some brief absence the entire waitstaff was brand new.  Hmm.  Without adequate compensation, who is really going to care about service?  This has always bugged me about CC.  I hope they change their ways.",

Smooth followed by a touch of heat.    - The chicken jalfrezi was a little too creamy, but the hot peppers and the green peppers gave it a nice flavor  - Although not really an IndoPak dish, the chicken hummus was really good as well.

The mean was entirely too soft, there was no crispness or flakiness at all. The kebab was actually flavorful, but very dry.  It's not all bad though. The tandoori chicken was excellent; flavorful and moist. The service was good, especially considering there was only one server there, and I really enjoyed my strawberry lassi. Oh, and they brought out some pepper flakes for us after asking if they could bring something to make it spicier.  Probably not going back. There are better places to get Indian food.",

My chai tea tasted like Lipton tea...ZERO spice and it took over 30 min to get my tea. The garlic naan was good and the cheesy naan was too cheesy, like imagine quesadilla on steroids. Unfortunately my night ended with a roach chillin to my right just crawling across the table......shit happens, it's gross but it is bound to happen at some point somewhere...this place is clean and new but I could not eat another bite, a roach is a definite deal breaker! I tried this place due to the triple D show but I think I'll stick to my joint down the street, Khoorinors.",

I'm also a foodie and have expensive taste, so I love when the three can come together on rare occasions, and bless me with great food!   I love Indian food, especially Pakistani and Punjabi. I'm still trying things on the menu but so far, the Chicken Tikka was flavorful, I wish I would've gotten their wonderful saffron rice with it, instead of the regular basmati, but saving money, it tasted just as great. The Aloo Palak, potatoes with sauteed spinach and spices was a great vegetarian meal and went perfect with rice and their GREAT garlic Nan.   I also had the the Goat Biryani and though I loath bones, the meat and saffron rice with the rendered fat from stewing made it worth the extra effort of getting through the many bones (that is to be expected with any goat dish at many ethnic restaurants and is part of the dining experience). Very well done dish.  Yes the atmosphere is laid back, but the owner caters to us college students and that keeps the cost down, I think they're the most reasonable Indian restaurant in the valley, that alone will keep me coming back. The service is good, laid back as well, the owner is very kind and attentive, again the food is great so I'll be back often, you should definitely pop your head in and start with some Nan and let your mind wander through the many choices..  They even have daily specials, like Halal Kung Pao Chicken one day...",

We went on Thursday and the server barely spoke to us--it took 10 minutes to get menus and we were never offered refills on our drinks. We had to explain when we paid for our meal everything we ordered because the server didn't accurately write anything down. They clearly do great business with their carry out service, and my thought is that they should do away with the eat-in restaurant all together and just focus on that. The food is always *almost* awesome enough to merit the treatment, but I think this last visit will be, in fact, our last visit.",

The owner did compensated us with a free entree and was nice about the situation from the time we walked in. My friend got the new naan (not knowing I had the old burnt stuff) and I guess they heated up the burnt naan and put it back in the foil...

    "text": "I've eaten Indian food one other time. It was buffet style- ok, but... Curry Corner is a sit down, order from the menu and I simply do not have a metaphor to describe how good it is. We ordered: (spelling?) tandoori  chicken, masala chicken and a thick lentil soup- don't know the name. Our meals came with long grain white rice and nam. The tandoori chicken came sizzling to the table, perfect char, covered with onion and bell pepper slices. It was unspeakably good! The lentils over white rice was a perfect side. The rice was plentiful and steamed (I assume) correctly. The nam was sprinkled with cilantro, there was more than enough and it was amazing! Now for the Marsala chicken. Served boneless in a red sauce, I couldn't believe how good it tasted! It had a flavor that imprints on your mind. Slightly spicy but no way over powering, since I'm a novice with Indian food I am unable to identify the ingredients. Let me also say; in my opinion, when one eats at an 'ethnic' restaurant and 40%+ of the other customers are of that ethnicity, you can pretty much bet you are getting the real thing! My only thoughts on improvement would be the chai tea didn't seem to have the sweetness I'm used to and I like to listen to the music from the country with the food I'm eating- just me... Curry Corner- you win! One more thing before I go; I usually try to take a photo or two but when the food came to the table, photography was the last thing on my mind",

    "text": "People have to stop judging Indian restaurants by how they make Chicken Tikka Masala or any Tikka Masala for that matter. Yes, Chicken Tikka Masala is an Indian dish but it is not the only Indian dish. Hell, it's a north Indian dish that seldom gets any attention in other parts of India.  I choose Curry Corner over other Indian restaurants in this area because of its positive reviews. I ordered a Lamb Biryani and a Chicken Curry to-go was told the order would take 15-20mins. So I sat at one of the tables and patiently waited. The place was not busy and almost everyone who came after me got their food served while I was still kept waiting. Finally, after more than 35mins of waiting my order was ready and I was told the Lamb Biryani usually takes time to prepare. So I thought maybe Biryani was worth the wait.  Initially the Biryani looked good but when I started digging into it was when I realized how badly it was prepared. The Biryani was just rice mixed with some curry and a few hard-to-chew lamb pieces thrown in. Trust me, it tasted awful. I simply don't understand why some Indian restaurants have this compulsion to include a Biryani on the menu when they don't know or even have the faintest idea about how it is prepared.  And as for the Chicken Curry, it tasted OK; nothing great - just mediocre.  Curry Corner is another Indian restaurant serving mediocre Indian food to susceptible locals. What a shame!",

The chicken boti was some of the best I've tasted - the meat was juicy and fully flavored, and the spiced onions complement it nicely.

If you have never been before and are not sure what to order I found that there online menu has pictures which is really helpful. I wanted to get what I got the first time but I didnt remember the name and was not very good at explaining what it was so I ended up with something different, but it was very good too.",

The cheese naan is out of this world good - it is light and flavorful and just the right combination of crispy outside and soft inside. I love that there are so many meatless options.   The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because every time I go, the water is constantly running in the women's bathroom. It never shuts off, and that bothers me. I hate wasting resources and for the water to ALWAYS run - that is a bit excessive to me  please fix your sink so I can update this review and change the rating to 5 stars!! Thank you!!",

So, I scrammed to find a yummy place last minute on Yelp which was in the area, and Curry Corner popped up.  I am very happy that he and I went to this place after all. Since I am doing a physical and spiritual cleanse at this time and cannot eat meat, dairy, processed sugar, sweets, breads/white flour products, this place made me happy.   I had their veggie combination and was blown away by how well delectable they can make chic peas and spinach taste with their spices and techniques.   I am going back when I can eat meat and bread and will enjoy their fish/chicken dishes and supposedly amazing naan.  I am a fan!  Love, The East Coast Foodie",

Kitchen plays their music too loud so you get a strange mix of mariachi and Indian music playing over each other. Order to-go and you'll be very satisfied though",

    "text": "DDD gave this place more praise than deserved. I went there yesterday and ordered: Fresh Karahi Goat $11.00, Tandoori Chicken Tikka $9.00 and Cheese Naan $3.50.   The best dish with the best value was the Tandoori Chicken ($9.00). The 2 pieces of chicken came with rice and the overall dish was flavorful and simple and priced appropriately.  The Cheese Naan was good, except for the sand particles which prevented me from finishing this item. I only ate about 1/4 of this because the cost of finishing it (replacing a crown or 2 and/or chipping a tooth or 2) was much too expensive for me. My decision not to finish this cheap ($3.50) but sandy item probably saved me at least $500 in dental work! (No LOL) Leaving sand particles out might make this item a favorite for seniors trying to preserve delicate dental work.   The Karahi Lamb was a little hot but it was definitely delicious! However, the $11.00 price tag was not justified because they skimped on the lamb meat - 5% to 10% of this dish contained lamb meat. And most of this meat was meat which you had to chew off of some very small bones! Very disappointing.   I had an interesting experience here. By the way, I no longer find DDD a credible source for excellent restaurant recommendations. Lastly, the service at this place is lacking. I never received a spoon to mix sugar into my tea and I never received my bill. After waiting for 15 minutes for my bill, I went to the cash register to pay. When you're waiting at the register, it makes it hard for them to ignore you.   If they make improvements, I might return to give them one more try.",

    "text": "I discovered Curry Corner recently when an Armenian cab driver I rode with, told me Curry Corner was his favorite restaurant and he eats there Thursday least once or twice a week.  So I ate there, once, about 4 weeks ago.  No white people were in there, which may be a good sign of authenticity.  I had a goat kahari dish, was good!!  Warning, when server asked me if I wanted garlic Naan or plain, or course I said garlic, but she did not tell me garlic cost extra over plain.  The owner took the extra off my bill, cos server did not tell me.  Owner told the server she mush tell people garlic naan cost more.  Nothing much on the menu was over $12.  Tandoori chicken looks good too.  This place is for all the Indian ASU  students to eat here for affordable price.  I will come here again with more people and eat family style.  Sept 15, 2017, I came here to eat again with two eating buddies.  Prices really went up from those posted here on yelp.  The menu was covered with little white stickers reflecting the price changes, I'd saty 20% more than the prices in the photos of the menus and the menu link on Yelp.  I had the mixed grill for $12.50 (two kinds of chicken and seekh kabab.  I told my server to make sure my chicken is not hard and dry .  When it came, it was still kinda dry.  The table next to me had grilled chicken too, and theirs was not as dry, they pried it open and showed me.  Wild Diner buddy had chicken mahani with the cream gravy - REALLY GOOD, I think she had the best dish.  I t hink I will have that next time.  Other Wild Diner had Nehari Noor Jehan, which she said was spicy!    The service was hit and miss from a tall white guy.  We even laughed, cos he brought water glasses without straws (people at other tables all had straws).  So one of us asked for straws, but later he brought only HER a straw.  i said i would like a straw too, and my other eating buddy said same, so then he brought us two more straws.  Later, he brought us more straws, like he forgot he already brought us straws.  My chicken pieces were really large and needed a knife, so I had to ask for a knife in order to not eat like a cave man.  I also had to ask for a spoon.    I think this second visit - food 4 stars (I tasted the other diners choices), service 3 (cos he was friendly and not rude otherwise it would be a 2 star), tho a bit hodge podge.    We arrived on a Friday at 6 pm.  At 8 pm, the restaurant was totally full of people, except one booth in the corner.  YOUNG people, mostly whites (as opposed to Indians).",

We went last night to celebrate my husband's birthday and ordered the goat curry and chicken handi. It seemed as if they used the same sauce for both of these dishes even though we ordered completely different dishes. The sauce itself was just a thick tomato sauce without any gravy and it was rather sweet with no flavor. The lamb also was tough and difficult to chew. We sent the lamb dish back notifying the server of our issue and they just brought it back by diluting the dish with water. In addition, the service it quite lacking as well as no one comes by to check in on you to see how you are doing or if you need anything. You always need to flag a waiter down if you need something. I think we will be taking a break from Curry Corner for a while.",

The afghani boti had so much delicious spicy flavor with lots of cilantro, the meat was so tender and juicy! The malai kofta was delicious not as heavy as I'm used to with a little more spice than normal, which was a nice change. The aloo mataar was a great vegetarian dish high on flavor! Of all the dishes I've tried there was only one I wouldn't order again, the nehari noor jehan. The meat was too fatty and there wasn't much; I think I had 4-5 pieces. Overall, I love this place and wish I lived closer to it!",

    "text": "I have been to curry corner before but i was waiting to try their Tandoori chicken Tikka (which was featured on food network) before giving them a review. We walked in today for a late lunch,the place was almost full and people kept coming in,they also had a large number of pick up orders.  We settled on a cozy booth and ordered ~Tandoori chicken tikka (marinated Thigh and leg of chicken,charcoal grilled) $8 ~Chicken reshmi kebab (chicken marinated in garlic and ginger paste,cooked in tandoor) $8 ~Non vegetarian Thali (rice,naan,dal,two types of chicken curry) $8.75 ~Lassi (salted yogurt) $2.25 ~Soda $2  The thalis are not available for take-out. All tandoori items are served with Rice or naan,mint chutney and pickled onions. They also serve Sindhi biryani here which is a little different from what you would typically get at an Indian restaurant (Hyderabadi/Andhra style).The biryani is nice,flavorful and has a subtle hint of whole spices.I am not a fan of the salted lassi (i was expecting it to be buttermilk). The tandoori chicken is definitely better than a lot of other restaurants it's moist and tender but lacks flavor. The service is a little slow and it took the food a good 20 minutes to get to our table.  Overall i would give curry corner 5 stars for affordability but 3.5 stars for taste.  Cheers!",

Should mention that the service people had no personality what so ever. No smile, no welcome, no \"what would you like to drink?\"  Husband ordered the chicken tiki Marsala-which took forever to arrive at the table. My son and I got our chicken dishes but he had to wait another 10 minutes or so for his food. The waiter did not tell us that it would take longer to come out. No mention of spice level was mentioned not was there any indication on the menu that spice level can be altered. Ordered a chicken dish in coconut curry (could not tell you what the dish was called). It was really good but I couldn't eat it since it was too spicy. Had to change dishes with my son since his dish was not as spicy. When all our food was finally brought to the table no one came back to check on us if everything was ok or if our water needed to be refilled. While Guy Fierri May have visited this place and liked it on DDD not sure if we will come back.",

When we were checking out, she said how hungry she was because she isn't allowed a break (which I let her know was illegal, but I guess she needed a job). When we were going to leave a tip, she also let us know that the owner keeps ALL the tips and told us we didn't need to leave her a tip since she wouldn't see it anyway (we even tried to give her cash and she didn't take it).   I REFUSE to eat at Curry Corner until they treat their employees better!!! This is so wrong & I now understand other people's comments on the poor service they receive. If I was working there and was illegally denied a break and my tips were taken from me, I would have no motivation to provide quality service either (although this girl was great).",

My one small complaint is that when you order the food to go, the packaging leaves it vulnerable to spilling. The food is so stinkin good that I can't bare to lose a drop of sauce.

This place has some of the best curry in Tempe that I've had only problem is the service is always so slow to the point you don't even want the food anymore. I recommend calling in for pick up because you might get so upset at the slow service that you may not even enjoy the food. Overall I love curry corner though!",

The cheese cubes inside the paneer tikki masala was good, but the sauce initially tasted like speghetti sauce. The sauce looked different than the chicken tiki masala, which was spicier but tasty. The palak murg was devoid of any flavor but spiciness. Just mashed spinach in oil.",

What made it awkward was that this place was completely SILENT... the only noise were the people whispering and quietly talking, so we decided to do take out instead. We tell the waiter we changed our mind to take out and he got annoyed at us... but the food is overall delicious, just work on the customer service and the environment of your restaurant.",

I ordered the tandoori wings and a side of nan - I never got the nan - it was delivered to the other end of the table and I never saw any of that. Everyone else got their orders but me - I waited 10 more - long - minutes before my 8 little tandoori wings arrived, only to find that they were dried out and so hot with curry that I could only eat one. I was extremely dissappointed to say the least.  My daughter who had her 6 week old baby with her - asked for a small bowl of hot water to place the baby's bottle in (to warm up the milk) - and was told by our server that \"they don't have hot water here\".... Seriously? You're a freakin RESTUARANT and you DON'T HAVE HOT WATER? Finally, after realizing what a pathetic boob he was making himself look like, our waiter brought a small teacup full of warm water to our table.  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand to top things off for our excursion to a Triple D rated establishment - ALL TEN OF OUR PARTY GOT SICK FROM THE FOOD WE ATE AT THE CURRY CORNER!!! Maybe they should change their name to the \"Colitis Corner\" - cramps, nausea & vomitting - I lost a day of work due to the food I ate made it impossible for me to go to my job.  This is the seond time I've gone to an establishment that had the old \"As Seen on Diners, Drive ins and Dives\" - Curry Colitis Corner is DEFINATELY A DIVE !!! Be afraid - BE VERY AFRAID !!!!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "My friend in Arizona recommended Curry Corner after finding it via the Food Network app. Overall the experience was good, but I don't think I'd return if I were in the area as I've had better Indian and Pakistani food.  We arrived on a lazy Sunday afternoon close to 12 and the place was quite empty. We sat at one of the few small tables against the wall and began debating what we should order.  We started with an order of the Tikka Masala fries, which I'd seen recommended on Yelp. They were good, especially the portions with feta cheese, but I'd recommend skipping them. The fries were pretty soggy, which is understandable, but the tikka masala sauce wasn't very flavorful or spicy.   I ordered the Vegetarian thali, a combination of 2 vegetable curries, lentils, rice, naan, yogurt, and a small salad. It was good, though the lentils were incredibly salty. The standout for me was the yogurt dip, which I found really refreshing. The curries were good, just not outstanding. Still, the price can't be beat for the amount of food you get.  My friend ordered the Arabic Plate, which is like the thali plates in that you get two kinds of curry (hers had chicken), lentils, biryani rice, hummus instead of yogurt, salad, and naan. I liked these curries better than my vegetarian ones personally.  The oddest part of our visit was watching someone, presumably an employee, wander back and forth between the kitchen and cleaning the outdoor windows. It made me feel slightly awkward about the potential for unsanitary conditions where my food was being made.  I'd honestly skip Curry Corner, but it's not a bad decision.",

I ordered the 'Afghan Boti' reluctantly and because I was hungry and have spent 5 years in Afghanistan previously for work. Very familiar with Afghan food even though I had never heard of Afghan Boti before but ordered it under the assumption that it must be close to or similar to Afghan 'Dopiaza' based on the description in the menu.  The description could be misleading especially for folks who are familiar with Afghan cuisine.  Basically, it states \"...white meat...\" without specifying whether it's chicken or beef.  However, Afghan Dopiaza is beef chunks/cubes (with and without bone) that is slowly cooked and the beef comes out sort of whiteish...a common dish.  This was certainly not the case, they served me with pieces of chicken breast that was mostly RAW!!! I even showed it to the waiter half way through my meal, he was nice enough to offer to replace it but at that point I had lost my appetite.  Additionally, I think the cook just went postal with SALT! Oh my God, just WAY TOO salty just unbelievably salty!   I also ordered the Lassi (yogurt drink) and it was so thick that it made it almost impossible to drink through a straw.  So, I asked the waiter to dump half of it and put water in it so it can be real Lassi which is supposed to be thin!   I am sure other dishes are probably good but I don't believe that I will EVER order Lassi and the so-called Afghan Boti again.  Besides, can't expect an Indian restaurant to produce authentic Afghan dish.",

    "text": "Ok, it was almost  a year since I ate here with my wife but I finally signed up for a Yelp account, so here we go...I have been itching to write a review on this place because it is one of those experiences that had such highs and such lows that it kind of eats away at you.....  We are celebrity chef nerds, and try to eat at places that we see on DDD, Anthony Bourdain, etc.  Visiting from Vancouver, B.C., we were looking forward to this spot.  We come from a city that has one of the worlds best Indian chefs, Vikram Vij.  I also had many Indian neighbours growing up.  Finding tin foil packages on the door step, filled with home cooked Indian food is a treat for sure.  Needless to say, we are well versed in quality Indian/Pakistani food.  I even learned many recipes and cooking methods from our Indian neighbours over the years.  Ok enough back up...  I will try to make it short...  For the most part, the food was great.  The curries/sauces were very flavourful and authentic.  The service was ok.  The server we had was a bit on the lacking food knowledge side.  Or at least how to communicate it in English.  We ended up getting what we wanted, so all was good.  Luckily I can say a few cuisine related words in Indian to help him out.  The one thing that was a HUGE disappointment was the goat.  I LOVE goat.  I have had goat at Vij's that makes you wish you ate goat several times a week. Good goat should be fall off the bone, slightly gamey, and like the best pot roast you've ever had but bettter.  The goat here was so bad, I couldn't eat more than half of it.  It was so chewy and gristly that it was embarrassing.  This was the dish that was featured on DDD, and the reason I thought about this place for months???  There is no way a restaurant should ever put out an ingredient that is so far off from its acclaim.  It's maddening.  The curry/sauce was SO amazing that it made it even more maddening.  I ended up having sauce with naan as a meal.  I may visit here again, but I really hope they take their reputation seriously and not follow the few that suffer the fame-to-fail route.  The sounds from all the reviews since my visit here tells me they might very well be going down that path.",

One of my friends told me its somewhat revamped and apparently the food quality has changed and it tastes much better now. Nothing like that, on the contrary its has worsened.  We ordered mango lassi, paneer tikka masala(comes with naan or rice), garlic naan, tawa parantha , and veggie biryani. They couldn't serve the biryani cz they were out vegetables (whaatt!!! ) . So we ordered malai kodta with rice instead.   Ok lets not talk about authenticity and getting that real taste with the proper ingredients with almost all the reataurants claiming to serve Indian food here in Tempe. I 've made my peace with that long back. But then this place surprised with how pathetic their food quality and taste can be.  The paneer and kofta were served with the same curry base which felt like someone just opened a tomato paste can. added some random spices and served it with paneer and kofta. Wait, I am missing some important ingredient. I got up in the end to wash my hands , (restrooms!! lets spare them here) and this red color wont go off my hands. So they did have some artificial color added as well. We are also missing some surprise ingredient here which made out stomachs go haywire after having our dinner.  And btw the rice never came. Asked them twice. The cashier showed us the order slip and told that the server missed out rice so its not our fault=). He did correct himself and was gracious enough to give us a $2 discount.",

    "text": "My husband and I freaking love Indian food. We had a business trip in Scottsdale, AZ, and after watching Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives and seeing that Tempe was just 10 minutes up the road, we made it our mission to try Curry Corner. I had high hopes for this place to blow my mind.  We were served quickly, but the meal left much to be desired. We started with samosas which were really good. However the water they brought us tasted like it came out of a hotel swimming pool - very chlorine-y.   I asked if I could have tikka masala, except made with shrimp instead of chicken (usually an option at most Indian places). The server said he \"would ask, but the cook is sometimes funny about stuff like that.\" I didn't understand how difficult it could be to put tikka masala sauce over shrimp instead of chicken, but I was ultimately served shrimp tikka masala. What a disappointment! The sauce literally tasted like Campbell's soup, or ketchup. Just plain tomato sauce. I don't know if this is some side sauce that was whipped up to satisfy my request for shrimp in place of chicken and just wasn't the normal tikka that is used, but I was pretty sad about the whole thing. Had I known it would so negatively affected my meal overall, I would have just stuck with chicken.  The rice was flavorless. Normally I can eat rice from my favorite Indian places plain, because it's so delicious and cooked with cinnamon, cilantro, cardamom, etc. The rice not only didn't taste seasoned, but it also took on the chlorine taste from the water. They would really benefit from installing a water filter in their restaurant.  My husband had chicken makhani which WAS really good. The cheese and garlic naan were also both delicious.  I wish I could give my experience a better rating, but it was ultimately a disappointment for me.",

    "text": "Two words:  Goat Karahi.  The reason I will be willing to drive from San Tan Valley to Tempe again.    Hopefully I spelled this right, by the way.  I forgot to grab a take-out menu to get names right.  Anyway, this dish was suggested by our server.  Who incidentally was very courteous and attentive.    The goat was tender, flavorful and just delicious.  We should have ordered two dishes of it because it comes on the bone and my husband and I were left wanting more.    We also had the Chicken Korma, which was good but when we return we'll try something else.    Prices are excellent, entrees include either rice or naan.  We opted for rice but also ordered garlic naan.  Good call on our part.  The naan was crispy and soft at the same time with great garlic flavor.  Yum!  If I understand correctly, they've recently remodeled.  I saw no problems with cleanliness, one of the things that seems to have been an issue previously.    Had a nice chat with our server about how their experience was with Guy Fieri as well.    Can't wait to go back and try some other dishes.",

    "text": "This place gets 4 stars because the food is amazing. The service, however, left a little to be desired.   When we walked in no one greeted us and there was no sign saying \"seat yourself\" so we sort of stood there for awhile not sure what to do. Eventually we just sat down and waited. It took awhile for the waitress to come take our order.   We ordered tikka masala fries, the vegetarian combo, and my husband ordered the tandoori chicken. Everything was great but those fries were killer! They were delicious. I couldn't stop eating them.   The naan that came with the vegetarian plate was so good. I loved everything.   When we were done we waited a really long time for our check. Eventually we just walked up to the register where the waitress was and asked her if we paid there or at the table. She was really nice but I think she was overloaded with how many people were in there.   I will go back. It was seriously good enough to make me drive out to Tempe again. The place isn't a fancy restaurant (really casual) but the food is worth it.",

They have renovated the place but have got downhill regarding the food. Even the restaurant area is not so clean and there's always food and stuff under the tables where the customers are supposed to have their meals. Disgusting. I can not even mention one food item that impressed me. Chicken tikka had a lot of color which even colored my fingers, nihari was tooooo salty, biryani was bland, chappli kabab was burnt and parathas didn't seem like parathas. Even the server never comes back to check on us once after taking the order. Plz management pay some attention to your quality of food n customer service. Otherwise u will b losing customers like me.",
