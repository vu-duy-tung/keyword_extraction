    "text": "Hillstone is a great upscale yet casual restaurant and bar.    My man and I have been here multiple times after the change from Houston's to the now newly re-named, re-located and renovated Hillstone...It's a definite winner for great menu options, heavy cocktail pours and nice ambiance.    My man had been talking about a  specific dish he had discovered during a business meeting for close to a year as of last night. He had been raving about how wonderful it was and how he knew I would absolutely love it...Last night, I FINALLY experienced the dish, and OMG it was/is FABULOUS!  If you're an Ahi Tuna fan, you MUST order the \"FLYING TUNA PLATTER\" off the dinner menu (It's not listed on the lunch menu, but you can ask for it by name and they'll make it for you anyway)! It is divine...Bon Appetit!",

Went to Hillstone for an early dinner before catching the MAVS game. Charlotte was our waitress. She was awesome. So was the smoked salmon, veggie plate and burger that we scarfed down.  This location was phenom. The architecture was beautiful. Loved the open bar concept and the sculpture. Really added a special ambiance to the evening.  Above and beyond as usual!!",

I can see this as a good place to take a first date to really knock their socks off with fanciness. I ordered a salad, which was tasty, but should have gone for the crispy chicken sandwich or one of the burgers - they looked delish! I will have to go again and do everything right this time :)",

    "text": "After literally 25 years of going to the Houston and Hillstone restaurants in Phoenix, I am now completely disappointed with them!  For all my daughter's birthdays, they have written Happy Birthday on her plate in chocolate every time we have asked. So naturally when my daughter said she wanted to go there for her graduation celebration,I called to ask if they could simply do a Congratulations plate. I was told \"we have never done that\". Well there's the first lie right there. They've been doing it for years.  Second they said \"we don't have the tools to do it\". There's the second lie. My husband is a chef and has actually talked to their staff about the plates before. They most certainly have the ability. So what this boils down to is that this Manager that has been with the company for only 4 months has now destroyed the awesome experiences I have had with my family for years. What happened to the amazing customer service that the Hillstone corporation used to provided?  When did it stop mattering to them that they had a loyal customer for over 25 years!  Extremely disappointed!",

It usually doesn't take me long to pick something out of a menu and theirs isn't particularly big, but their selection was so interesting I didn't know what to pick. So we decided to share the Shrimp Macadamia Nut sushi, Smoked Salmon, Rotisserie Chicken, and the Prime Fillet. Very very satisfying. Not the biggest portions but honestly one of my most favorite restaurants.",

    "text": "I was introduced to this restaurant about two years ago.  I've tried the following:  Hand-cut French Fries (excellent, great dipping sauce) Baked Idaho Potato (plain, bland, but not dry) Thai Steak & Noodle Salad (a personal favorite, very flavorful, has mango pieces) Biltmore Chicken Sandwich (a classy version of the McDonald's version, good flavor) Rotisserie Chicken (very moist chicken, falls off the bone, good flavor) Barbecue Pork Ribs (disappointing, would rather go to bbq joint down street) Roasted Prime Rib (excellent cut, well sized, with horseradish and au jus) Center-cut Filet (very god, albeit a little plain) Osaka Pressed Sushi (best dish in the restaurant)  It gets busy for dinner, usually Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. Even if you have reservations, expect a 10-20 minute wait...on a good night! They still take walk-ins on busy nights, but those waits range from 30-60 minutes.   Very classy, but not in a stuffy sort of way. I wouldn't show up in shorts to this place, but I've seen people show up in t-shirts before. Most men wear button down shirts, and the only people who get away with shorts are the older gentleman wearing Tommy Bahama that sit at the bar.   Dressing well seems to get you seated faster if you're a walk-in.   The food is decent, not great by any means. The Osaka Sushi alone is worth the trip. Nothing else on the menu is really of note, but nothing is bad either. They do everything well, but aren't great at anything. They are one of the few places that serves decent prime rib in Phoenix.   Overall, a highly recommended restaurant for their ambiance and consistency in great service and decent food.",

The choices seemed somewhat old school, nothing flashy, unlike most of the newer upscale restaurants that have popped up around town over the last few years. However, when these generous friends gave us a gift certificate, reservations were made. Wow. What a classy place! Really comfortable. The interior was just perfect. Wood and leather but with a sleek modern touch. Not too modern though. This warm and comfy atmosphere set off by a large, bright and bussling open kitchen really set the tone for the great meal to come.  Just ticking through the items we ate: rainbow roll, each piece a bright explosion in your mouth.  Artichokes and dip, smoky and delish. Wife's filet, best I have ever sampled from her plate. My Hawaiian rib eye, while less tender loaded with flavor. Great key lime pie and excellent coffee to finish it all off. This is a special occasion place that has truly earned all the accolades it has received. Can't wait for the next reason to try the Hillstone again.",

We split the spinach dip (on a recommendation from my other half's friend) -- amazing. I had the \"Nice Little House Salad\" (which, by the way, is not named after the French city of Nice, rather the English adjective, which proved True) -- extremely fresh, tasty and very generous with the goat and heirloom beets.  Enjoyed THE BEST rib eye I've ever consumed!  Flawlessly prepared and 1000% tasty!  I got a loaded baked potato for my side and I also ate my partner's cole slaw, which was creamy and horeradishy and supremely delicious!    The ambiance; amazing.   The service; flawless.  The food; divine!  It's a tad pricey for a weekly dinner stop, but worth every single penny of it!",

I loved Houston's, and I think the only reason they moved locations & changed the name was some behind the scenes legal drama to prevent Houston's from being considered a large chain. So Hillstone... somehow seems more pretentious? We went on a Sunday night after 8 and the place was still packed. All the tiny booths next to the bar were empty though. So we head over, thinking it must be part of the bar, and the waitress steers us away and says that it's part of the dining room but they simply don't have enough servers to seat anyone there. And there's a 45 minute wait. My question is, why have the seating at all if you can't accomodate that many people in the restaurant? At least make it part of the bar.  We head out to the patio, which was fine because of the heaters, but then we come to find out they only serve appetizers out there, according to the waitress, because the kitchen is on the opposite end of the restaurant. Well, after we had ordered 3 appetizers at different times, I figured they might as well have walked to the kitchen to pick up what we actually wanted to eat, as I assume they were picking up appetizers there anyway.  Bummer.",

    "text": "It pains me to write this review as Hillstone, formerly Houston's, has been one of my favorite places to eat for the past 20 years. The food and service have always been delicious and dependable. However, my last visit left me and my boyfriend with such a sour taste in our mouths, I am unsure we will return.   We arrived on a busy Thursday evening, hoping to sit in the bar area. We enjoy the lively scene and people watching. We figured we'd have to wait a bit, which we have done on countless occasions. There was one seat available so I sat and we were greeted by \"Al.\" Seemed like a nice enough guy, very friendly and quickly served us our first round of cocktails. We asked \"Al\" to keep an eye out for us as we were wanting to have dinner at the bar, he said, \"We'll get you seated, no problem.\" After my boyfriend ordered his second cocktail, we noticed \"Al\" greeting two of his regular customers that had just walked into the bar area. He walked out from behind the bar and greeted them with handshakes. There was a small high top they sat down at, too small for dinner, but would do for drinks. As he walked back behind the bar to retrieve their bottle of wine, I saw him hold up two fingers to the other bartender. Within 5 minutes we noticed them sitting down at the other side of the bar where two people had just got up. After watching this all go down right in front of us, my boyfriend asked \"Al\" for our bill. He had a surprised look on his face that we were leaving, since we told him we intended to have dinner. I told him we saw what transpired with his other preferred guests. He quickly apologized and offered to buy us our drinks. When my boyfriend declined and said we would take our business elsewhere, he came out from behind the bar and continued to apologize and offered to buy us dinner. We declined and left money on the bar for our drinks. How could we enjoy a meal after he made it clear the business of his regular customers was more important that ours?   Fortunately, we did end up having a lovely dinner down the road at Mastro's City Hall. The bar area was very full and we ordered a couple of drinks and waited for a spot to open up at the bar to eat. Our bartender \"Christian\" looked out for us and we were seated after about 25 minutes. We enjoyed an amazing steak dinner and were treated with first class service by \"Christian.\" We will be back to City Hall, not so sure about Hillstone. Truly a shame.",

    "text": "I wanted to like Hillstone before we even entered the restaurant.  The patio is charming and romantically lit, and it wasn't overcrowded.  We were brought to a large booth in the back of the restaurant with a party of six and while I enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant, I have to say I was less than impressed with the waitstaff.  The first server who came to our table (who was apparently only there to take our drink order, but didn't tell us that so it was really confusing when a different server showed up a few minutes later), literally COULD not understand what we wanted to drink.  I was with two moms-to-be who both wanted club soda with cranberry juice and a splash of pineapple, which I'll admit, is a little random and high maintenance for a nonalcoholic beverage but the server should have been able to handle it.  Instead, she just kept saying, \"So, Absolut and club soda and what?\" \"Absolute and pineapple..?\" These women did not want vodka in their pregnant bellies! It wasn't even particularly loud in the restaurant, I think perhaps Hillstone is just doing its part to hire the hearing impaired. Although she finally seemed to grasp that they were ordering nonalcoholic drinks, I seriously wanted to take a sip of the drinks first to make sure they weren't spiked.  The whole exchange was just weird.  The \"real\" server wasn't as bad, just kind of inattentive and awkward.  I did enjoy my food though...I got the spicy tuna roll salad which was really interesting and tasty and everyone I dined with seemed to enjoy their dishes.  I'd consider coming back for the food and the ambiance but it's definitely not one of my favorites, there are better places in town for the price.",

Let's be clear about one thing however, not one thing on that menu can be on the low caloric side or even semi healthy..in fact, we learned that Hillstone is just Houstons (menu of course gave that away), but under a different name so the company doesn't have to release nutritional values...eeek!)

I have never had a bad meal here, and the service is really good too.  The bar is a bit crowed after work, but the drinks are good.  Parking can be interesting if you don't like to valet (I don't), as the garage can fill up quickly.  If you like steak, ribs or burgers, head over to Houston's.",

    "text": "I remember driving by here on the way to Ruth's Chris back when we were first moving to the area, thinking \"we should come back and try that place!\"...finally, almost a year later, we did.  It's definitely a five star restaurant, for the price.  The prices are reasonable, the service is the fastest I've experienced in my life, and the food was great!  We did have almost an hour wait--but the fish pond outside made the wait seem much shorter.  I would actually give a 5 star score if a) they hadn't run out of prime rib and we had wanted the beef dip and b) the waiter hadn't forgotten to put our (non-alcoholic) drinks on our bill, then asked if it was \"ok\" to add it after giving us the bill.  Normally when a minor mistake is made on a bill ($10-$15ish for four of us), the restaurant will comp it.  Normally with you order something and a server comes back 5 minutes later to tell you that they're out of that item, especially when there's such a limited menu, they'll do something nice for you, right?  I thought the \"free\" drinks were to compensate us for the lack of prime rib, but apparently not...  We'll definitely go back.",

The meat was very pink, looked raw. I didn't really like that. My bf got the prime rib, it was soo yummy. Came right off the bone. All together our meal was about $80. We only got one appetizer too.

The wine list always has a pleasant surpise on it and the staff are attentive and sensitive at the same time. If you have never had the experience of dining here, don't cheat yourself any longer. I have been an restaurant owner and in the food business for over 30 years and this place is one of the best I have been in for great overall experience.",

After sitting at what used to be an open seating table at the bar, I was passed by at least 6 different employees without as much as a smile let alone a greeting.  Finally after 15 minutes one of the exceptionally rude waitresses came by to kick me out of my seat.  Customer service was terrible so i left.  I felt no need to try the food for fear of more terrible service.  I would have to say that most people didn't go to the old Houston's for the beautiful building.  I hope the staff loses the attitude and remembers that customers matter.",

    "text": "I had been a fan of Houston's (which closed) and was told that Hillstone was the replacement/new Houston's. I decided to give it a try (I was hungry/thirsty driving across town on my way home from being out all day).  I checked in with the hostess and inquired about patio seating (they have a really nice patio).  The hostess informed that the patio seating was limited to sushi menu only.  I asked about bar seating and she said that the bar seating is full menu service.  I sat down at the bar and was sitting there about 10 minutes before I could get a bartender's attention.  A female batender walked to the end of the bar where I was sitting and I asked her for an iced tea and menu.  She brought my iced tea and menu about 5 minutes later.  I waited another 10 minutes before I could get her attention (she was at the other end of the bar chatting it up with some patrons) to tell her I was ready to place my dinner order (at this time, I needed a refill on my iced tea).  The female bartender disappeared right after I told her I would have the prime rib medium rare; I did not even get a chance to also request a refill on my iced tea because she left.  About 10 minutes later, a helper from the kitchen comes out with my prime rib and sits it down on the bar in front of me.  I asked him if I could get a refill on my iced tea and he said that he would tell the bartender and disappeared.  The female bartender was still on the other end of the bar chatting it up with the same patrons/not even looking in my direction so I asked a male bartender, Daniel, that was chatting it up with a group of guys if I could get a refill on my iced tea.  About 5 minutes later he brings the iced tea. The vegetables that came with the prime rib were not what I expected (had some vinegar stuff poured on them and I cannot eat vinegar; menu did not say that vegetables would be drenched in a vinegarette dressing); I was hoping to get a side salad swapped out since I could not eat the vegetables.  About a third of my steak had been consumed and I stopped and was waiting to get Daniel's attention (he was still chatting it up with the group of guys) and a helper from the kitchen came up and was trying to take my plate (thought I was finished).  I told the helper that I would need a box (wanted to at least take the rest of the prime rib home).  Daniel appeared with a plastic take home container for me to put my prime rib in along with the bill.  I asked if I could get an iced tea to go and Daniel informed me that they do not do \"to go\" beverages.  I tipped 15% (I usually tip 20-25%) put was even hesitant to tip the 15%.  No one ever checked with me to see if everything was ok (food, needed a refill on my beverage).  Original bartender walked away and left me to fend on my own to find another bartender to wait on me. Other bartender completely ignored me/would not even look in my direction.    Prime rib was good but not worth the $43 tab for a piece of prime rib, 2 iced teas and lack of service.  This place is trendy; if you are not a friend of the bartender, not a regular customer that the staff is familar with (and not ordering unlimited alcoholic drinks), do not expect to get any service or attention.  I will not be back and do not recommend.",

The snobbiness of the staff, that pretentiousness that says.... I work in an upscale, high class clientele restaurant does not make an employee.... upscale and high class.

You will make your money tonight, but the restaurant lost $$$.00. I'm sorry but I've been in some of the finest restaurants around.....YOU JUST TOLD ME I DONT MATTER TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT.  And I am a regular. Very disappointed that I put up with what I perceived as stuck up employees because I liked the food and atmosphere. This broke the camels back.

She remembers my boyfriend's drink and mine after three times of coming in during their busy lunch hour. Courtney, the petite blonde bartender is also a sweetheart and very obliging.  I have recent been enjoying the red Sans Liege Grenache blend wine. I get the bottle and can always take it home if I don't finish it!!!   Here is a tip, get the rotisserie chicken and sub the fries for the Cesar salad. You will get way more chicken and it's only a $2 up charge for practically the same thing as the chicken Cesar salad.",

She was also very kind and attentive, brought us extra plates as she saw us sharing some of the dishes.   The food was just as good as always. We were happy to see some new items that were not available in new york. The poke was alright, but the California burger and thai salad were very pleasantly delicious.   The outdoor seating looked great - but as they only serve mini menu there and we were expecting a solid dinner, we didn't got to try the outdoor seatings by the water. Maybe next time!",

While Arizona isn't a place known for stand-out sushi, I'd order it here again.  And in fact I did...two nights in a row.   Night #1 - The bartender was a superb professional. He replaced drink napkins when they were damp and even poured my martini into a fresh cold glass when I was half-way done.  Class act.  He was also the one who recommended the Thai Tuna Roll which adds even more points to his score, if possible.    Night #2 - CRANKY bartender. While she recommended a nice glass of white wine, she poured me a totally different one the second time.  While it was St Patrick's Day, it's not like this place was packed out with annoying patrons so I'm not sure what put her in such a bad place. It did leave me with a not-so-happy feeling when I left, despite the fact that the food was just as good as the first go-around.    So, what could be the only gripes aside from the attitude?   * You will pay a chunk of change for your meal here (but it will likely be worth it)  * You will also likely order something that they're out of (mango salmon roll the first night, grilled artichoke the second night, and every night I've ever gone to a Hillstone, for that matter) * It's a chain  Bottom line is that Hillstone is probably one of the better options in this neck of the woods.  Go for a cocktail and a Thai Tuna Roll, if nothing else.",

I don't like that diet coke is by the bottle and you pay for refills - a little annoying - and it is a somewhat pricey restaurant but the food is really really really really really good. That makes it worth it. This restaurant group does have a number of locations, and I have been to a lot of the in different states, but this location specifically on Camelback is by far superior to the others (Dallas, Scottsdale, Boston, etc). Couple other things to know: no mashed potatoes during the daytime, baked potato only offered during weekend during lunch, not on weekdays during lunch. I usually come in jeans and polo shirt and, since it is Arizona, flip flops and I am always under dressed. Highly recommended restaurant.",

Runners delivered food & picked up empty dishes at times without saying a word. Food was great. The Smoked Salmon was delicious as an appetizer/starter. Ordered Ding's Crispy Chicken Sandwich. It was served like sliders, it came as a trio. Possibly need to rethink the choice of bread for the \"sandwich,\" it was too much bread & fell apart when I picked it up. Receptionist/Greeter seemed a bit frazzled when challenged. I had made reservations for my group, called to increase the number of attendees a few days prior & was  told that they are unable to sit more than 6 people at a table, group larger than 6 would have to be split up & no guarantee of sitting near.  However they would ensure that my group would be next to each other. We did sit next to each other & we had different servers. Tables are all booths-so terrible for groups larger than 6, everyone gets crammed in & they failed to mention that. Had I known I would have moved the gathering elsewhere. 3 Stars only because of the food, if not than 2.",

The transition from Houston's to Hillstone did not change the great service, wait staff, bartenders  and best quality tasting food. Majority of the same menu items are still being served along with some new tasty dishes and may I add Sushi has joined the family. The new location has a small area that includes Sushi Chefs who make a limited variety of fresh Sushi options to enjoy. The bar area is defiantly happening. You will find me there on Tuesdays or Thursdays because that is the nights they serve their famous Tortilla Soup.   Some things I would like to add is they patio is beautiful with brown tone desert scenery. There are bar stools and comfy couch chairs to wine and dine in. There is a limited menu on the patio so if you want the real yum-yum you got to dine indoors. During the cold winter nights there is a fire pit that is in the patio and main walking entrance. A small built in pond at the entrance of large exotic goldfish to great you. As soon as you walk through the doors the fresh aroma of food from the Kitchen is right at the door. Along with a visual aid of all the variety of dining options to choose from. There is a hostess to lead you to your table or direct you to the bar. The bar includes a big screen for all you sports fans.",

We've had everything on the menu and there isn't a single thing that's not delicions. The filet, the Hawaiian rib eye, the ribs and the sushi are the standouts, and my go-to favorite is the Thai steak and noodle salad. It's to die for.  I don't understand what the 3-star reviewer was complaining about. The staff at Hillstone is SPOT-ON.  They never miss a beat and yes they work as a team. We generally have one assigned server by through the course of the meal will see three of for different faces.  Yes, it's pricey but the quality of the food warrants the price.  It's a True dining experience and I can't recommend it highly enough.",

    "text": "My third time here - first two times A+ This time, not the case  I ordered the French dip sandwich and my girlfriend ordered the fish sandwich; which i had the last time. She loved hers as did I when I had it. Mine, on the other hand, was dry, bland, and bread was horrible (tasted old, and did not compliment the sandwich) More so, the waitress had a horrible attitude, unlike the last time (totally opposite). This one  had zero personality!  She never checked to determine if I was pleased with my meal. So, i took the bread off and just ate it - it was hardly a $20 sandwich. When she picked up the dish, after having to flag her down for more hot tea for my girlfriend, i expressed my dissatisfaction. She sent the manager over who was also low personality and very snooty. I felt like I was on trial; she even asked if I've ever had a French dip sandwich before which is quite insulting. She then insisted their bread was made fresh each day - I've had fresh bread - I used to live in Europe - Abd this ain't fresh bread; more so, the comment was made with a snooty attitude! They took it off of the bill which was not my intent. My intent was to provide feedback for the rude service more so than the over priced sandwich!!!",

We got approached by 3 different servers before our actual server came over, which was a little confusing.    We ordered a California Roll to share, I got the Prime Rib dip and my mom got a chicken sandwich. The roll was OK, I've had better. The dip was pretty tasty and the fries that came with it were well seasoned and crispy- just how I like 'em.  The service here was exceptional. The food, considering the price, just didn't really do it for me. For a $50+ lunch, I wish it was a little more memorable.   What I did dig tho, were the giant fish outside who practically jump out of the water when you sit by their little \"pond\" thing. Besides the service, they were my favorite thing there.",

I love the freshly squeezed grapefruit juice for a greyhound, when they don't have a good bubbly by the glass, (the wine list changes frequently).  And unfortunately, I'm not a fan of the bubbly stemware.  It's too thick of a glass to twirl and feels clunky.   The food is always soooooo good!  Sushi is fresh!  The fries are hot, crispy, d'lish with lots of garlic. The salmon is cooked perfectly. The side veggies (or cheat mash potatoes) pair so well w any entree.  The burger is juicy & prepared as requested.    The ambiance is energetic & lively.  People watching at the bar and patio is entertaining... And you may make new friends that way too!   The place is always packed, that can be a good and bad thing.  Parking is tight.  Wait times can be long, but if you're in no hurry, it's a good time.",

My daughter used to work for the Houston's GM at one of their affiliates, Bandera in Sacramento. The environment was a bit dark and very reminiscent of Bandera, which I like. Due to our daughter's connection out table (two)were treated to a nice assortment of appetizers which were all tasty, The artichoke spinach dip and salmon were particularly enjoyable. My brother and I both had the Hawaiian (teriyaki glazed) Ribeye and they )at least mine, was prepared perfectly, perfectly. Surprisinly they had one of my favorite wines on the list too - Napa Valley's Swanson Merlot (2005) and it complimented the steak very nicely. I finished with the 'Harvest' Cheesecake and double espresso and then we all drove back to my brother's house very content - thank you Houston's.",

We are very pleased with the food and service every time we go to Houston's, both the Phoenix and Scottsdale locations.   The spinach dip appetizer is tasty. The accompanying sour cream and salsa are good mix-ins for the dip.   Houston's serves meat from Allen Brothers and it has to be the best steak I have had. I definitely tasted a difference in their filet after they switched to Allen Brothers. The filet went from a 4.5 stars to 5 stars! Always cooked perfectly, very tender and great flavor. I'm never sorry that I get it every time! Traditional salad is always a good add-on... great combo of big chunks of juicy ripe tomato, bacon crumbles, crisp lettuce with delicious cheese toast on the side. Sides vary - I usually get one of the multiple variations of the seasonal vegetables. Roasted winter vegetables, roasted corn and the brussels sprouts are particularly good.   Now I can't leave Houston's without at least a few bites of the hot fudge sundae. The hot fudge is thick and delicious. No sundae anywhere can compare. In the fall, the Harvest cheesecake (made with butternut squash) is a must have.   Service is always top notch. Wait staff are very knowledgeable, attentive without being overly present.",

The spinach dip is the best ever created in the world!!!  I actually like the change to the salsa they did!  The Grilled Chicken Salad is a dream with the peanut sauce, or the Thai noodle salad-I love the mangos, tomatos, and avocados its delicious, or the caesar salad, or the hickory burger with fries, or the ribs and to top it off the sundae!!!! The chocolate sauce is orgasmic!!  i wish I could have it everyday! The new restaurant is a little confusing because the front door is in the back of the building and its kind of awkward b/c if you dont know that you will walk right in the middle of the dining room and bar area.  However, the restaurant is beautiful and so open and airy!  The patio is perfect and I wish I could have eaten out there but it was sprinkling and cold!  There is something for everyone here and you can go for lunch or dinner!  Head this way!!!",

    "text": "Recently went to Hillstone for lunch and while the food was adequate, it was not deserving of the rather high prices. Personally, I had the Thai Steak & Noodle Salad. The salad was confusing, to say the least. The salad is not particularly well thought out. The steak was randomly dispersed throughout the salad and it was neither in bite sized chunks, nor in one uniform piece. The steak chunks also were not uniformly cooked with pieces ranging from rare to medium rare to well done. Additionally, the flavorless noodles were clumped together making it difficult to get one bite with all of the good Thai flavors (ripe mango and fresh herbs) that were present in the dish. In other words it was tasty, but not well executed.  There is a point at which service goes from being excellent to obnoxious. This line was crossed at Hillstone. The server wiped water rings from the table every single time he would visit. Also, the server circled back to the table far too often and when it was clear that none of the five people in our party wanted anything he would stand there for an additional 10 seconds with a goofy look on his face before again wiping the table and departing.  The ambiance was excellent (complete with excellent people watching), the food had good flavors (albeit poorly executed), and the server was clearly trying too hard.",

The only way this place will continue to thrive is by the endless stream of business \"professionals\" who work at the Esplanade and nearby corporate centers who have grown tired of the Biltmore Fashion Park's mediocre restaurants.  Ask for your check the minute you order because it takes 20 minutes to get the bill.  Oh, and PAY CASH so you can leave in a timely manner.

Having eaten at Houston's (in Houston), I thought this would be a great place to get a steak.  I was probably shooting a little high.  Service was good, but there were issues with the food.  First off they ran out of baked potatoes, not a big deal but perhaps a little foreshadowing?  The Steak came out with no red in the center, probably a solid medium.  The redone steak came out a little more pink (not red), but still did not have the deep, meaty flavor I was craving.  The Fish sandwich we ordered was good, as were the cole slaw and broccoli sides.  In other words, I would come back here for lunch (the fish sandwich), but not the steak.  I can't comment on the sushi, maybe this is what they are concentrating on.  I would not avoid this place, but it certainly isn't worth going out of my way to visit.",

I had to break the news that the Camelback location closed. We drove there to see what was there in its place and came across Hillstone. He said \"Hey, there's Hillstone, it's the same as Houston's...\". I disagreed and we went in to investigate. I found out he was correct! The interior looks exactly like Houston's and the food was the same awesome cuisine -- although they didn't have my favorite, the Camelback Chicken Sandwich. I'll have to ask them if they'll make it next time. The Salmon was great. The drinks were great. All around great experience.",

Around the table we had the Osaka pressed sushi and Coconut Shrimp roll for a starter, the campfire ribs (out of this world), Famous French Dips, and wrapped up dinner sharing a strawberry shortcake and fudge sundae. My son said the ribs were the best he has ever had, I would have to agree with him. Service was top notch as usual. Recalling back to the last 6-8 times we have visited Hillstone they have been right on time with the reservations. My only complaint is that we live about 35 miles away.",

Tender and marinated perfectly! Try the Thai salad with steak. Yum. Their hamburgers are not just regular hamburgers. They are gourmet for sure! Huge baked potatoes with all the fixins! The margaritas are some of the best you'll have! They have an incredibly good cognac for an evening after dinner drink.

    "text": "Would you like to have really bad drinks, or not be able to drink?  This is the place for you.  I sat with a friend at one of the tables in the outside bar area very early on Thursday night.  There were only two other people there.  Keep in mind it is a full (and very large) bar, and I would assume anyone hired there would know how to make any drink.  I wanted a margarita and noted on their drink menu that it had raw egg in it (this is new to me, and I drink a lot of margaritas).  I asked the waitress if I could have a margarita with no egg.  She said no, that the sweet and sour mix has raw egg in it.  I paused, wondering if she knew you didn't NEED to use sweet and sour mix to make a margarita, and in fact most places I eat DO NOT use a mix, which makes a far superior margarita.  I looked at the drink menu and started to order their last specialty drink, until I noticed it also had \"sweet and sour mix\" in its description!  Giving up, I said, \"I'll just have a Paloma please\".  Without missing a beat, she responded: \"I'm sorry, but we don't have all the ingredients to make a Paloma.\"    I'm slightly dumbfounded at this point, since the ingredients for a Paloma are: Grapefruit juice, lime, sugar, tequila, and club soda.  Sometimes if a bar doesn't have grapefruit juice they will use sprite instead of club soda.  I would love to know which of those items a full-service bar doesn't have.    I ordered a club soda.  I'm never going back, because I shouldn't have to bring in basic recipes for the bartender to follow.  And they probably should have wait staff that actually makes an effort to see if the bartender might be able to figure out a way to make a drink that doesn't include a raw egg.  Too much to ask?  I'm still wondering what ingredient they didn't have to make a Paloma.",

No customer service at all.  My water was NEVER refilled and actually throughout the whole meal I was dying for water however the server was nowhere to be found.

The hostess as well as the servers really work together as a team to ensure everyone has what they need. We started with the features appetizer, artichokes, which were very good. The sauce they serve with is complimented the dish well. I had the Ribeye. The pineapple marinade had me interested and it was a knockout. The steak was well marbled, cooked perfectly, and the marinade was subtly sweet. I subbed me potato for their broccoli and it was fresh and cooked well. My colleague had the rotisserie chicken which looked very juicy and has great presentation. My colleague said the herbs were just enough to give it some flavor without being overbearing. The cashew and kale salad was fresh and flavorful. I was only in town for business but if I ever come back, I will definitely eat here again.",

Highly disappointed with the food and the service.  The servers are more attentive at Fort McDowell Casino and even Denny's.  We had to wait over 15 minutes to just get a refill on our coffee.  The food, I had the sushi and the Kale Salad very boring nothing to write home about.  They do not have many things for non-meat eaters.  Overall it was not a good experience and our server Jessica seemed afraid of our big table, but Shelly was much better even though it took way too long for refills.  I felt like cattle as they try to get everyone in and out in a short time frame and it was very disrespectful, to say the least.  I may try on a different day or even for lunch as they might not know how to do things rights on special occassions.",

Fast forward to living in Phoenix and meeting hubby and he now is hooked. We've since relocated to San Diego but are coming to AZ this weekend and I'm planning how we can fit in a visit to Hillstone on Sunday before we leave!!  The spinach dip is also awesome. Tons of spinach and love the sour cream and salsa on the side. With the French dip, I like that you can get it done to your specifications--in my case, still mooing! The fries are excellent too. I've literally never had a bad meal here and service is always great. very consistent with food and service across the board.   Please, please please come to SD!!! Driving up to Santa Monica to get my French dip fix is no Bueno!!",

We also ordered the salmon and mango roll which wasn't all that great, but definitely edible.  The wait for a Friday night around 8 pm was about 15-20 minutes which was not bad at all.  Service was impeccable.  Very attentive and different people catering to our needs which was nice.  Drinks were always refilled in a timely manner and they checked on us just enough to make it not seem obnoxious.  I will definitely come back here again and try other menu items.",

With the holidays approaching, make sure to make reservations here unless you are patient for standing room only!  The sushi is quite cold, tastes super fresh and is memorable. The caeser salad was a bit underwhelming; if you order with rotisserie chicken added, there is an up charge, as well as an assumption that the homemade croutons are not desired.  The great service brings me the side of croutons, with a minor wait. However, it really appeared that there had been portion cost analysis on this entree. Suffice to say, I tried the tuna poke to fill up a bit more.  Beau had the Thai noodle steak salad and it remains a favorite.  So, Hillstone is certainly a favorite but it does not come cheap. It is also the best bar for people watching.",

Also that I didn't want my prime rib, a near $40 dish, to dry out under a heating lamp in the meantime. She said she would speak to the manager. Later my prime rib was brought out by the manager, Amanda Murgas, and she said.....nothing. Not a word... With no due respect: what a LOSER! I don't know how she got the job but I do know she shouldn't be keeping it. The timing of meal serving is an important aspect of a multi-couse experience and regrettably mismanaged at Hillstone. And I say this after experiences of this sort in Phoenix AZ well as the Santa Monica CA location.",

The salmon appetizer is the BOMB, the spinach artichoke dip is absolutely incredible, the Prime rib sandwich and the kale salad are mouthwatering and the Hawaiian ribeye is indescribable!!!! You MUST save room for dessert because the Hot fudge sundae is no ordinary sundae! They make their own chocolate sauce and you practically want to drink it! It is deeeeelish!!!!! They top it off with whipped cream and crunchy sugary pecans......, omg!!!!!  Hillstone is the best! P.S. If you only want drinks and appetizers, sit on the patio, the feel of the patio is wonderful, they have built in ac fans under the tables that actually blow in to your lap to keep you cool- There is a large 2 way fireplace which really adds to the atmosphere!

    "text": "Came here with a couple of family members on a Wednesday night.  One of them had a gift card and was eager to give this place a shot.  Its a good thing she had a gift card because the prices were on the high side.  I sort of expected that given this place is in the Biltmore area, and I'm usually willing to pay a premium if the food matches the hype.  Did it?  The place was packed, so before I could even think about my food I had to shout across the table just to hold a conversation.  Yeah, its loud in there.  Our server was very friendly, though we had to ask her repeatedly to speak up to hear her over the noise.    We started with the grilled artichokes with remoulade.  This hit the spot since I love artichokes and each had a perfect char.  For my main course, I got the French Dip (in part because my brother claimed it was the best in town).  It was one of the better ones I've had as they used good quality cuts of meat for the sandwich.  For dessert I shared a brownie with nuts and ice cream with the table.  It was adequate, but didn't wow me.  So let's get to the price breakdown.  Artichokes?  $13.  French Dip w/side salad?  $25.  Brownie?  $12.  So before tip, it was $60 just for the food I ordered (never mind the food my other two family members ordered).  Maybe its just me, but if I'm gonna drop that much dough, I'd better be getting a fantastic meal.  The meal, sadly, was not fantastic.  It was adequate, even good in some spots, but not fantastic.  And the items I ordered were actually on the cheaper end of the menu.  Most of their main entree items are $35 and up.    What this place brings to the table in terms of friendly service, an elegant atmosphere, and artfully crafted food simply doesn't measure up in terms of intimacy, flavor, or prices.  I might be tempted to try this place again on AZ Restaurant Week or another promotion when restaurants like this slash their prices, but would not come here again on a regular night.  Not enough bang for the buck.",

My mother and I came here for brunch on a Saturday and we were seated right away.  We had a couples seat next to the bar that overlooked camelback.  The atmosphere was amazing, it felt so welcoming and relaxing that I wish I could come at least 4 times a week.  My mother absolutely loves the mimosas here and the old fashion I had was superb!!   My mother ordered their kale salad which she orders probably everytime she comes here, and since this was my first time I ordered the burger (I forget which one specifically) however I must say it was the best damn burger I've had in a very long time.    I will most definitely come here again it's such a great place, our waiter was awesome and never really left down time between drinks and our food.  He consistently checked up on us which is fantastic.  I will tell everyone I know to check this place out!",

We were planning to go to Mastro's, but it was a later reservation and hillstone was (sadly) closer so we came here.   *Make a reservation- you can show up 10 mins late since they don't sit you for 20 mins after your reservation time anyway, every time   *Service is nice, but rushed unless you basically make it clear you're not in a rush to order all at once and would like to take your time. Should be standard?  We sat, ordered apps, and my drink. Had to ask server if my drink was on the way after apps were already finished and my drink hadn't arrived. (Not a big deal in that moment.) drink arrives and we think all is well. Order entrees.  I ALWAYS order medium rare for filets at EVERY steakhouse I've been to (mastro's, capital grille, steak 44, J&G, ocean 44... even black angus, lol). Every steakhouse besides Hillstone can perfect a medium rare. Hillstone does not ever get it right! Ever!! It comes out rare, bloody in the middle, NOT \"pink\", blood seeping out. I send it back and it comes back as a medium, dry on the outside. They can't get medium rare correct, ever. I've had this issue every time. You'd think they could get it right since it's the 2nd most expensive protein on the menu..?  Whoever dropped off my steak after being cooked more asked if I needed anything else, I said I'll please have another drink. (Not my server, food runner, maybe?) I asked because my first drink took forever to come out. What do ya know????? The drink never makes it out. My husband was almost finished with his meal because he was starving before my food came back out, when it should've been cooked correctly to begin with.   The worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant other than a sports bar type of environment.   As I said the throughout the entire dinner, \"we should've gone to Mastro's.\" So my recommendation, head to Mastro's! Amazing restaurant compared to this place.",

These two items are the standard in dining compared to other restaurants whether it be for lunch or dinner. The Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich is always filled with a generous amount of thinly sliced Prime Rib and the Baguette is crispy and firm. Don't forget to use the fresh and warm Au Jous to dip your sandwich.  The Spinach and Artichoke Dip is top notch and comes with chips, salsa and Sour cream. If you run out of chips, ask for more, the awesome staff will gladly bring more.  As far as the staff is concerned, they are top notch, every time we have been there and this goes back to at least 20 years when this location was Houstons, we have always been served by top notch waitress and waiters along with the entire staff.  The Burgers and Chicken Fingers appetizer are also a favorite of ours, it is just difficult to pass up the Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich.   Will definitely be back again",

Appetizer: I love the the spinach dip, fiance loves this the coconut shrimp roll  Entree: French dip (I recently brought a buddy who was visiting from Chicago and he couldn't believe the best French dip he ever had was now from Phoenix).

He was easy to talk to and fulfilled all of our needs. I ordered the California Burger which was made to perfection. the presentation was very nice and the alcohol drinks were made evenly.   For a romantic date or a birthday celebration with a classy feel, i would definitely recommend this place.",

The new location is great (albeit some what confusing to find the entrance - head to the northside of the building -counterintuitive to a building fronting Camelback Road). Love the ambiance on the patio and the bar area, dining room is okay (not a fan of the artwork).  Food is consistently good. (Yes, portions are somewhat smaller than the old Houston's.) The prime french dip and fries are a favorite. Fish is always fresh and its nice that sushi was added to the menu (not amazing, but a solid option). Salads are crispy. Overall a solid dining experience.  Bar service is great - fast and friendly. Dining room service could tighten up, but give the service team a break and allow them to adjust to the new digs.   For the whinners that have reviewed Hillstone - please stay away. That much faster for everyone else to be seated.",

The service was fantastic, the food and drinks came out in a timely manner, and there doesn't really seem to be a bad seat in the house.  I went simple and had the cheeseburger and I'm still dreaming about the next time I can go back and have another, it was fantastic.  And then I doubled down and had the brownie and thought I'd died and gone to heaven.  And the wine list was pretty big with some interesting options.  I would go back in a second, just really decent American cuisine well-prepared and served with style.",

However, after a fiasco at trying to get a downstairs seat at Rokerij and then traversing a couple of other places, the only place that delivered was Houston's.  I will say, this is the only bar/restaurant that has merited a 30% tip from me.  Though they were out of the first bottle of wine we selected, they offered a better wine for the same price.  Sweet.  EXCELLENT service and very good food and wine.  That, on top of a really nice low-key ambiance accented by dim lighting, was what earned my rare five-star review of Houston's.",

Umm yeah had to pass on the 32 dollar strip steak special. Had the french dip (17 dollars), which was pretty good. The string like fries were tasty, just a bit salty. For the price and poor service, won't be going back.",

Though the name wouldn't imply that sushi is a specialty item of theirs, it should NOT be missed! Also, the crispy fish sandwich is delish as well. The only complaint that I have about Hillstone is the lack of Happy Hour. My girlfriends and I would frequent the place more often for afternoon chat sessions but right now, we would break the bank! Hillstone has a trendy feel - especially the bar / patio area but the service and food prove that this place isn't just here for a minute. Give it a try!",

For you meat eaters out there, the Hawaiian Ribeye will blow your hair back in the best possible way. They always have a great selection of produce available and veggie dishes are outstanding.   The only bummer is that it's a bit of a hot spot so it takes a while to get a table, and the clientele are a little douchey. In any case, on more than one occasion I have pulled the dinner and a movie date at Houston's and continued up to the Esplanade above. It's a good bet, but leave extra time at the restaurant to get yourself a table.",

As I sat there, I talked with my friends at the table about how I rated this a 5 on Yelp, and was surprised to find people on here who rate it less just because it's a \"chain\" and therefore not deserving of a high rating.  The 3 of us sitting at the table all agreed that, given the price point, Houston's is deserving of a 5-star rating. Now, compare this to NOCA down the street... not a fair comparison - different ballpark entirely. For what it is: mid to mid-high level sit down restaurant, it's great.  The staff are all well groomed and well dressed. Everyone puts the guests needs as a top priority and the service is truly outstanding... even compared to some restaurants that are in a higher price bracket. Whatever Houston's is doing to train its staff, it does right. The staff here is great.  The food is consistently well above average. Today I had the fish sandwich for lunch. It was great. Well-cooked, moist fish. Definitely fresh, quality fish. The fries are great.  I'm sure I'll be back again. It's on the list of restaurants that get a repeat visit from me.",

The staff is inattentive, the food greatly over priced and poorer than fast food quality.  We ordered a \"Classic\" California roll and were very surprised that is was not in fact a California roll (enough lemon flavored mayo to choke a horse).  Our entree which consisted of two salads took over half an hour to arrive, and seriously could have gotten larger fresher salads for half the price at Wendy's.  I ordered the Chicken Club salad, the mixed greens were wilted, the chicken sparse and mostly batter, two small cubes of avocado, and the bacon was leathery not crunchy.  My wifes salad had rotisserie chicken that was hastily pulled from the chicken and included connective tissue, fat and congealed blood.  While waiting for and eating our meal we observed two tables beside us have at least three employees stop by to chat for more than ten minutes at a time.  After our meal we sat and waited for 15 minutes for our server to come by with our check and then another 10 before we could flag down what looked like a manager to take our money.  It took another 10 minutes to get our change.  It was nice however to have the tip amounts printed on the receipt so that we knew what not to give.  I really liked Houston's the few times I was there, Hillstone I will not be returning to.",

Well, tonight our meal came out before the dip which is not a mistake we have experienced there before.  I imagine this is a rare occurrence here.  We have come here for years and were very surprised.  We did not say anything but We had a feeling they would make it right and boy did they ever.  We figured they would comp the dip because that is the kind of professionalism they pride them self on but they went above and beyond tonight.   They actually comped our entire meal (drinks and all).  We were beyond impressed and just validates why we absolutely love this place.  Thank you Hillstone!!!

In the middle of our appetizer is when they asked for our dinner order, which they could have easily done when they took our appetizer order.  We had finished our appetizer and no one had taken our menus from our humble little table.  When appetizer plates were cleared by a peer, the menus were picked up.  Their peers did their best to keep us hydrated as they passed by, but that individual was not keeping us happy, as they wanted to clear out and go home for the night.  We still had drinks at the table and they took an empty water glass, rather than just refilling it as we had just paid the tab.  It was rather dumbfounding, and we were surprised Hillstone had not kept up their standards service-wise.",

Hillstone is the parent company as well as a number of other restaurants such as Bandera (Chicago), Rutherford Grill (Napa Valley), and Woodmont Grill (Bethesda, MD). I once had an aspiration to visit every Houston's but am now reconsidering. Unfortunately, the Phoenix visit is where this reconsideration started.   We went in for an early weekday lunch. Our server was polite but acted like he was being forced to be nice...fake enthusiasm with a lot of teeth showing.  His enthusiasm didn't translate to familiarity with the menu. He told me that the kale chicken salad was like the regular chicken salad - somewhat accurate but much less helpful than explaining the differences to me when I told him that I had eaten the chicken salad many times. NOT the same in volume nor flavor.  And I have more general angst against Hillstone/Houstons: - Rarely offer open table or other reservation system - No more off the menu classics but stil a limited number of menu selections - Wine selections have become more pedestrian over the years   C'mon Hillstone...step up!",

    "text": "Hillstone is the Mecca for impeccable service and consistency in high-quality food. It's the type of restaurant that you visit and expect a flawless evening. The thing is, you expect it because it always happens. Food is never rushed to the table upon ordering different courses, service flows incredibly well, and if there is any sort of mishap they fix it without question.  The burger is fantastic, the french dip is the best in town, and the pork ribs are incredible. They also serve sushi and while the selection is limited, it is excellent as well.   The restaurant design is brilliant. Low lighting around the tables with a singular light right overhead, making for an intimate dining experience without the distraction of the hustle and bustle that goes on during service. They even designed the \"well bar\" to be set up next to the sushi bar so that servers are not constantly coming up to the main bar to get drinks during lunch/dinner which helps efficiency. Small details, but they were thought out to perfection and it makes a big difference overall.  You know what you're going to get when you come to Hillstone. Consistency is the name of the game, and with so many other restaurants dropping the ball when it comes to food and/or service, it's why I keep coming back time after time.",

    "text": "I'll spare you the lament over Houston's...you've heard it all.  Hillstone was my immediate pick when I found out some clients were coming to town from the Midwest. I wanted to take them somewhere nice that gave a good representation of the area and offered a menu they would like. I LOVE that Hillstone has fresh & innovative sushi without letting that bleed into \"Asian-fusion\" territory for the rest of the menu. I figured these clients would be \"meat and potato\" folks, and that's precisely what was offered.  We started with Happy Hour on the patio and we were all thrilled with the koi pond, comfy seating and gorgeous overall patio ambiance. However, our group of 7 had a really tough time because the patio is definitely set up for groups of 2-4. Still, we made it work for a couple of rounds of cocktails. When we moved inside for dinner, they offered to seat us at two separate tables, since no tables accommodate more than 6 or something...not good for business conversation. We ended up in a corner booth that suited us fine. It was a little cramped  but after our happy hour drinks no one seemed to mind.  The service was so great, (except the cocktail runner who spilled my wine upon delivery and failed to bring back a napkin or anything...?) and the servers we interacted with were knowledgeable and skilled in the fine dining etiquettes of business entertaining. I was pleased with the overall experience.   The sushi was okay, and typically priced for that kind of place. The rolls were unique, but nothing to praise. The reason I have for 3 stars is value and food quality, and poor seating options for parties over 6. The $35 filet is enormous (12oz?!) but truly left something to be desired. It was not flavorful, and ill prepared. It did not taste or feel like a quality grade and I found myself wishing I had gotten the french dip or just more sushi instead. The potatoes that come on the side really tasted like they came from a powder pouch--nothing creamy or \"real\" tasting about them. The rainbow chard was good, though. I really really wanted to say the food was amazing but that steak, and those potatoes, were really subpar. I would have rather had 6oz of delicious filet than twice the meat that I didn't enjoy.   I'll be back for the patio ambiance but I won't be itching to spend the money for dinner.",

    "text": "Chic consistency is how I would sum up this classic example of what American dining should be.  Another visit Sunday night 7:30 work friend gathering party of 5. The first arrival was seated in a large booth on the north side of this gorgeous spot.  Of course the best views are at the bar but a booth is more spacious & conducive to conversation.    Our server was Yanni which she was kind, down to earth, and accurate with our requests. She made our experience seem cozy and comfortable.  When I read reviews of pretense at Hillstone, I cannot relate.  Yes the architecture and cuisine is nearly flawless, it does not seem snooty at all.  Our table had the ahi tuna steak, gulf coast fish sandwich, veggie burger, Thai steak salad, tuna mango roll, and bread.  All of us enjoyed the fresh straightforward preparations and delicious flavor combinations.  Yanni suggested the mi sueno el llano Cabernet to accompany my Thai steak salad- great choice.  A smooth lingering berry wine really enhanced the mango & filet mignon.    We shared a couple key lime pies with the non sweet whipped cream.  Truly a delicious example of classic pastry.  The lime filling with cold and tart not overly sweet and the perfect minty green homemade color.  The crust is a nutty crumble that you press your fork into the last crumbs.  I will continue to recommend this establishment to visiting clients in my nearby biltmore fashion park boutique.  Thank you to Hillstone for their service, food, and chic consistency.",

Party of 5 sit at the patio for drinks and relax before dinner. Patio heaters make it nice but the patio is maybe 20% full since it's cold. Manager says we can't have 5 chairs at our table. Huh? Has us move our chair back to the neighboring table - which remains unused, along with 20 others, the rest of the night (it's after 8pm). What idiot thought up this policy? It's not a fire or safety risk. It's a patio with tons of room. Believe it or not, we'll still come here often as we have faith that they'll pull their head out and get back to a high standard of hospitality. But be warned, this location can require some patience if you expect the Hillstone standard.",

It had a Frank Lloyd Wright/new age feel, very classy and swanky!  Service has always been attentive and quick.   On our most recent visit, my fiance went with the New York Strip paired with a baked potato while I went with the seared Ahi tuna and avocado & cilantro salad. I had bites of each and everything from the steak to the tuna to the baked potato was outstanding. The steak had a sweet and savory seasoned sear, the tuna was refreshingly good, and baked potato was filled with chives and grated cheese. The one drawback was the amount of salt on the skin of the potato. Coming from a salt-lover, I will say, it was a bit much and could certainly be a turn-off for those who dislike salty foods.    Come here for a special occasion, romantic date, or just because. Regardless of the reason, I've consistently found this place to be spot-on.",

A large and creative patio always adds a different vibe to your dining experience.   This evening I tried their sushi as an additional appetizer and the Spicy Tuna Roll hit the spot. The chefs create and jazz up your typical sushi roll, I would highly recommend.  The staples I personally order are the artichoke appetizer and Ahi Tuna Burger.  The artichoke is a delectable, Hillstone prepares and cooks this dish to perfection. You are able to order a full artichoke or half if you are feeling a little stuffed. Be prepared, the Ahi Tuna is a large sandwich and filling. The ahi is cooked medium rare and placed on a bun with a delicious sauce. I have yet to try any steak/salad but this is definitely next on my list.   In addition to my list, I would love a nice ice cream sundae with a warm cookie for brownie! I highly recommend Hillstone if you are in this area, you will not regret your experience. The staff are very helpful and friendly to meet your needs on any given night.",

Our waiter Brent was amazing!!! My husband and I tried his recommendations both on dinner and wine. We both had the salmon dinner. It was delicious. I ordered a dirty martini that came in a cold frosted martini glass, halfway through when Brent saw my glass not as cold, he brought me out ANOTHER frosted glass and poured my drink in it. OMG!

Shawn told us it sold out at lunch.  We were seated at six pm.  My wife did not believe him. She guessed a large party had yet to arrive and had requested this dish. I asked for the check an went elsewhere. My wife recalled we ate at at this chain in San Francisco.  I did not recall.  Must not have been notable.",

It took an unreasonably long time to get so when the waiter finally brought it, I quickly paid my tab and left without double checking it. When I got to my hotel next door and settled in for the night , I found that they had not given me any utensils so I had to go wander around the hotel looking for a plastic fork (chop sticks would have been ideal). The salad was half the size of my fist. The sushi roll fell apart if you tapped it. There was no soy sauce. For $40 (before tip) I had a terrible wine (my fault- I didn't return it because I hate being a diva), an itsy-bitsy salad, and a crumbled sushi roll with no soy sauce and no utensils.   And now I just bit into a shrimp shell.   It may just be my bad luck but as a frequent diner and traveler, I rely on yelp reviews and was severely disappointed by this recommendation so this is my first PSA.  For the record, the servers were great. Prompt service and smiles abound. Unless it was their responsibility to give me soy sauce and chip sticks...",

When the weather is accommodating, go to the patio because the chairs are comfy, service is great and a decent amount of food is available.  If you want to partake of their full menu, you will have to eat inside. Lovely ambience; perfect romantic lighting, excellent service and the food is always perfect (I have dined there over ten times in the past year or so).  They have one of the best wine lists around, and hte servers know how to advise.  Everything on the menu, from sushi to steaks, is always prepared just right.  They have a kale and cashew salad which is out of this world!  The bar scene is always lively, and Al is one of the best bartenders around!  They have TONS of parking too!",

We waited to be seated but not too long and we had lots of staff smiling at us, acknowledging that we were waiting. Our server, Melissa, was great. My guests commented that, while she didn't hover, she arrived at all the right times. All the staff was excellent. I would say that the food is predictable good. This is not \"cutting edge\" food. But every thing they cook and serve is done correctly. I am not a dessert person, but it was a birthday celebration...so we had sundaes. I recommend the ice cream sundae which is exactly what you remember from being a kid - only better. One note of caution: the restaurant is a little noisy. Sure, they'll say 'energetic', but I am sticking with noisy. It would not keep me from returning but I would not bring my 70-something parents.",

    "text": "We may not have a lot of bragging rights here in Phoenix, but being able to sit on a patio in November and have a few cocktails is such a luxury, especially when you bring along out-of-town visitors.  My friend from Denver won't see a patio for months, so I was thrilled to introduce her to Hillstone.  Maybe it was the fact that we were just having cocktails and not ordering food that set the weird tone of the evening - or maybe the wait-staff at Hillstone just sucks.  I'd been to Hillstone twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.  I've always found them (Hillstone/Houston's) overpriced, but a nice night out.  The atmosphere is really nice, the food is not exactly innovative, but it's consistent.  I'm not going to get into a Houston's/Hillstone comparison here - the food is about the same as always, but the new location is very pretty.  My friends and I found a table on the patio and settled in for some drinks and girl-talk.  The fireplace was awesome and there are heaters placed here and there for us thin-blooded Zonies.  The waitress came along shortly to take our orders, and our Denver buddy got the first RULE of the evening.  She ordered a cocktail and asked for a double (Hey, we had some major catching up to do - we wanted a little alcohol to get us started.)  She was immediately informed by our sneery server that Hillstone does not serve doubles.  It's just not that sort of a place - they don't want to be known as a drinking establishment.  To break the awkward silence, I joked that maybe the server could bring my friend two drinks instead of a double, that got me nothing but an icy stare.  I ordered a diet coke and a shot of tequila.  I'm not a big drinker, but do like a little buzz now and then, so I get it quickly and then sip on my soda.  RULE#2 - I was told I could not drink my tequila all at once.  Hillstone does not allow \"shots\", so I must sip my shot of Hornitas.  OK, I'm 53 years old and this person is actually instructing me how to drink my beverage?  Really?  While we did enjoy our mandated cocktails and tried hard to follow the RULES at Hillstone, I'm afraid the tone of our much-anticipated evening just never really recovered.  It's a fun place, especially at night when the Cougars are out and on the hunt - great for people watching and relaxing, but I think the drink ordering moment proved so uncomfortable for our server that she left us high-and-dry for the rest of the evening.  We wondered if we were not Hillstone worthy as we searched for someone to bring us a coffee with Baileys.  We eventually flagged her down and got our beverages, but...it wasn't really fun to be there anymore.        Hillstone staff please understand that your place of employment being kind of cool and pretty does not earn you the right to be jerks to your customers.  I won't be back.  Oh, and on a side note, Hillstone, the kitty litter floor on your patio is just weird.  I had to empty the sand out of my shoes several times.    I wish Hillstone would get it.  Such potential - such a disappointment.",

I slather a bunch of BBQ sauce on it and oh my god..... and the crispy little shoestring fries on the side are perfection. I will have horrible heartburn after every time but that's because I eat, like, three times more than I usually do just because it is so so delicious.   My main tip is to park across the way in the Biltmore parking lot and walk through the tunnel, because the parking garage attached to that complex with Houston's is a total clusterfuck.",

Of course, when I first began going here, way back when, the only thing I could ever order was the Prime Rib French Dip because it's PRIME RIB french dip and it's perfect as a sandwich that costs $17 could be.

The place was packed to the gills so we assumed this place had to be spectacular- Well the first thing I smelled when i walked in was like a dirty lake smell- eventually deciphered it was from the water feature on the front patio. The prices were crazy to me for the simple food on the menu- 20 dollars for a french dip sandwich and 20  for a sushi roll... Seriously? The waitress suggested we start with the spinach dip - apparently they are famous for it... The plate came out with packaged plain tortilla strips - and looked like it came out of Applebee's kitchen. Zero flavor and I could have eaten this out of my freezer on my couch at home vs. expecting to go to an upscale place and be disappointed. After deciding that the menu made absolutely zero sense and the prices just did not back up the food or experience we paid for our appetizer and left ... we went to  Central Bistro and had an amazing pizza for 12 bucks.. Poorly done Hillstone- not impressed",

I've tried maybe 100 places since then and no one has come close.  No mix can compare either.  BTW...what to order besides the Bloody Mary...A house salad with blue cheese, French Dip Sandwich with the best French Fries on earth, and a big slice of their incredible edible Key Lime Pie.

I've seriously been going to this restaurant location for as far back as I can remember. And I've never had a \"bad\" experience. Yes some things could have been better, like a waiter not asking me how the food was when I haven't even taken my first bite. Or the waitress that couldn't remember to refill my glass without me waving her down. Its all good in the hood because the food is still good, and the service is never mediocre, and the atmosphere keeps me happy and comfortable.   Today, was a quick and tasty lunch. Surprisingly, I didn't get the 'hasn't been on the menu since G-d knows when' Flying Chicken Platter, which I don't ever not get. But ordered the Cheeseburger ($12) instead. Leave me alone, we're in a recession! The shoestring fries are something you truly can't not try while you're here. No dessert today, us church ladies had other plans for that slot in our stomachs and fat cells.   I'll be back in a few weeks guys...",

The salad and focaccia bread we shared as an appetizer set the tone for the entrees. Salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli for my wife, BBQ ribs for me. We shared portions of each with each other, and agreed that both were exquisitely prepared and tasted out-of-this-world good.   We are in the Phoenix area on vacation from Minnesota, and we won't hesitate to highly recommend Hillstone to anyone looking for a first-class dining experience. Bravo!!!

    "text": "Ahh the incredible eatery that is Hillstone! This restaurant is as modern as it is delicious. I may use this phrase a little too much, but in my humble opinion, when I use these two words \"THE BEST\", I honestly mean it...so here goes...I do, humbly, declare this restaurant to have THE BEST (and freshest) margaritas that I've ever had (and I've been to Mexico). I don't declare this statement lightly people; Their margaritas are a MUST order! So what makes this great concoction so brilliant you may be asking yourself? Well, they make their margarita mix in house every single day, so it's as fresh as the sunrise. This means that they squeeze the lemons and limes on the daily and make their own sweet and sour mix. The secret ingredient that makes this margarita so light and foamy is egg white; that's right, they put farm fresh egg white into their margarita mix to add some sort of magical flavor to this magnificent concoction. So *WARNING*-don't drink this magic potion if you're allergic to eggs. I honestly just love sitting on their outside patio (which is connected to their bar area) and ordering a couple of margaritas while eating some sushi (also fantastic) and oysters St. Charles (double-y fantastic) and just enjoy the beautiful weather/hustle and bustle of Arizona.  Main dish wise...you honestly can't make any bad choices; from the Hawaiian ribeye to their prime rib (I'm a carnivore obviously) to their salads, it's all grand! But please, please, PLEASE do yourself a favor and get a margarita while you're here. You won't regret it.",

    "text": "Amazing. So many companies don't understand how important it is for their customers to leave happy. Let me explain. It was Valentine's Day 2015.  They were packed. It is just my fiancee and I. We ordered burgers, some appetizers and drinks.  While we were waiting for our food our server accidentally spilled a bowl of cheese dip on the seat where my fiancee was sitting. It splattered all over the side of her nice purse. (Thank God she was in the restroom at the time). I covered the server and let her know I would make sure she doesn't find out. I felt pretty bad for her because she was sweet. I cleaned off her purse and it was like new. No harm no foul.  That was just the first incident of the evening.  We continued to wait an hour or so for just 2 burgers to come out. I'm sure you are thinking at this point I am crazy to still have this as a 5 star review. Keep reading.  Well finally our burgers come out.  Luckily we had some Artichoke dip and chips to hold us over until the burgers came out.  When the food finally came out the server told us she was so sorry and that the burgers were on them.  Nice gesture. I was pretty surprised. So many people have bad service at restaurants, but half the time I feel like its probably the customers demeanor to their servers.  My fiance and I are the type to be overly friendly to every server so everywhere we go it seems we have great service. Servers make mistakes. They are human. What matters is how they handle the situation after.  By the end of our evening we had ordered drinks, an appetizer, sides, burgers and a dessert. The bill was over $100.  The manager comes out and apologizes profusely for our experience. What he didn't know is that we weren't even mad. It was Valentine's Day so of course it's going to take a while for the food to come out.  When he came out he informed us that the entire bill is covered. Needless to say our server got a fat tip.  I have never seen such a thing before. What most businesses don't understand is that by him taking the financial hit he just ensured #1 me coming back in the future and #2 me giving this restaurant positive word out mouth. You can't put a price tag on that.  What also helped was the fact that their burger was one of the best I have ever had.  All of the rest of the food we got was delicious as well.  The ambiance and layout of the restaurant are amazing.  Everyone on the staff was friendly despite them having a hectic night.  I had a great experience and can't wait to come back.",

We were greeted by our hostess who asked us how we were doing. Well, it was a hard day as we had to say goodbye to our family cat that morning. Our evening at Hillstone was the perfect salve to soothe our sorrows.  The ambiance is dark wood and dim lighting. Though the expansive dining room was nearly full, it was quiet enough for us to talk in a low voice. Even the nearby open kitchen was barely audible.   We settled into our most comfortable booth for a splendid meal. We were not famished so we ordered light. My wife had the California roll and tabbouleh salad; both were delicious with an unusual sauce on the rolls. I had one of the best fish sandwiches ever. The perfectly breaded fish was cooked to perfection. It was served with a flavorful sauce that harmoniously melded with the fish. I ordered a side of perfectly cooked and spiced fries. It was all too much food as I suggested the fish could be served sans bun but with the fries; just call it fish and chips. It was simply delicious.  The hot fudge sundae and cappuccino were our desserts. Again, perfectly prepared and delicious.   The ambiance and food were only surpassed by the outstanding service. The attentive waitstaff were genuinely service oriented. Our waitress Katie even comped our dessert after hearing about our cat. Now that is how you give a great first impression. We will definitely be back.",

The exposed sandstone brick decor, with rich wood accents, low light and great background make this a sexy, sophisticated yet reasonably priced upscale place for a date or for an intimate gathering with a few friends. The service is also top notch and they have a nice selection of wine.  I have to deduct two stars for the lack-luster prime rib which was so disappointing after a delicious starter salad. I had to give props for the creamy horseradish which singed my nasal passages and brought a few tears to my eye. The cut of meat was generous in size and cooked a perfect medium rare as I had asked but it was on the tough and dry side and completely lacking in flavor. I very seldom send back meals and since there was nothing wrong with the preparation, I chose to just endure it.   So sadly my first experience here was a bit of a wash after the less than stellar meal. That being said that atmosphere here is just so amazing I will have no choice but to return, if nothing else for cocktails. But I'm sure there's something on the menu that I'm bound to enjoy. I will just steer clear of the prime rib.",

    "text": "In my early yelping days, I used to believe that a 5 star review for a restaurant, should qualify as a 5 star meal.  As my yelping abilities have matured, however, I have adopted a more holistic method for my reviews.  Ambiance, originality, and service are now major considerations as well.  And albeit a rare occurrence, the service here has earned Hillstone Stewart K.'s coveted 5 stars.  Now don't misunderstand the food here is exquisite.  Hillstone stated that it emphasizes local produce to comprise its dishes.  I am all for this, not for environmental reasons (which I couldn't care less about), but rather practicality.  Local food tastes fresher because it generally is.  The \"Nice\" salad proved this point as it tasted fresh and \"green\".  You know that new plant taste that food picked fresh from the field has?  This was especially apparent in the walnuts in the salad which had the imbued flavors of the shell still on it (without the crunchiness of course).    Ah, but here is where Hillstone's, or rather its server Becca, exceptional service points come in.  I was unsure of what entree to get here.  I asked our waitress for her recommendations.  I expected the usual spiel about how the server coincidentally thinks that the most expensive item on the menu is the best tasting.  Not so with Becca, she recommended the $28 ribs or even the burger.  Both are items that are on the cheaper end of Hillstone's offerings.  So despite how quickly, and almost artificially, she seemed to be able to rattle off the recommendations, she quickly gained my trust and passed my test.  But alas, I had ribs earlier in the day.  I opted for the $35 Hawaiian Ribeye.  It came out cooked perfectly medium rare (red with warm center), but a tad sweeter than I had imagined since it was glazed in something akin to pineapple something or other.  When Becca came by the table and asked, \"How is your meal?\"  I answered exactly as I mentioned above.  I guess my Northeastern bluntness may come across as a bit brash around these parts, but I was being honest and I did say that I enjoyed my meal.  But Becca seemed concerned though, like it was her mission to right some great injustice that Hillstone's chef committed against me.  Again, I assured her the steak was good.  So I rounded off my meal with the brownie in a cream sauce that was good enough to drink but decadent enough to make me sick and a coffee.      So throughout my experience here, my waitress thoroughly explained each menu item from the Lux coffee (a local coffee roaster) to practically every entree on the menu, with an patience and positive attitude that I'm frankly just not used to back home.  In addition, at no point did my  water or coffee ever reach empty nor ever leave my table for want of anything...but here was the real gem for the evening.  Despite my fleeting, obtuse comment about the ribeye being \"too sweet\", she removed it from the bill!  I assured Becca that I was genuinely satisfied with the meal, but she stopped me and replied, \"I want you to be completely satisfied with your experience here.\"  Then she said something to the effect that if I wasn't completely satisfied, I ought not pay. ....NOW THIS IS THE KIND OF SERVICE THAT TRULY DEMONSTRATES GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND FOR THE CUSTOMER.  So what I would consider about a 3.5 to 4 star meal, has become a 5 star experience.  If I am in the area in the future, I will return and would hope that this level of dedication to customer satisfaction is adhered to by all at Hillstone.",

Sauce on the bun was a nice addition.  I will definitely go back to this culinary hot spot.",

For starters, the service was very knowledgeable and friendly.  The chef's were extremely creative which led to my questions that the servers explained in completeness.  Lets get to the food...   I came with 3 co-workers and all of our meals were delicious.  I had the pork ribs and they were fantastic.  I was able to substitute the sides for whatever I wanted without a problem.  Everything came out delicious!  The ribs were fall-off the bone, some of the best ribs I've had.  Extremely tender and not overwhelmed with sauce.  Highly recommend this establishment.",

I have been to a number of these establishments going back to 1987 when I frequented the Houston's in Silver Spring, MD. The food is always great but they have the habit of taking the best items off of the menu, like the Santa Fe Chicken dish. I was dining at the Houston's in Scottsdale about a year ago and lo & behold, it was on their menu. Amazing. The Houston's locations in Pasadena and Irvine don't have it so....what gives?  Regardless, Hillstone's is worth visiting for some really good eats!",

It was very simple and good with a tasty aoli to dip it in.  The char on it was perfect and you can really taste it - not sure if its wood?  The burger of course had that great flavor on it as well.  It was a gigantic meat patty full of fatty flavor.  The bun was almost strong enough to handle it all, and there was an aoli it seems on it as well.  The shoestring fries that accompanied both our dishes were a bit greasy - kinda reminded me of In-and-Out but maybe a little crispier.  They have ketchup and a spicy aoli which was disappointingly not as good on the fries.  It has a very asian taste to it - like red pepper, rice wine and sesame oil taste.  It might be better with calamari or something else..  The chicken sandwich was innovative - it was presented as a sub cut into 3 sections which is nice.  It had a kale based slaw on it, which was delicious but a bit too dressed.  The chicken cutlets were VERY thin in some sections (think McDonald's burger patty thin!) so you can hardly taste any chicken.  I even considered taking apart a section to double up the chicken in the segment I ate.  Generally, I don't like too much meat in my sandwiches too so this was definitely a first.  So this far in I'm thinking this is a 3 and I feel terrible from all the grease and mayo-like sauces I just ate.  Then the waiter talks me into a 5 nut brownie dessert that makes me want to go back even now as I write this.  Pistachio, macadamia nut, walnut, and who cares.  AWESOME, and WHY DIDN'T ANYONE THINK OF THIS SOONER??    I'm definitely gonna check out their happy hour and get that brownie again.",

After 23+ years' great epicurean service to the city of phoenix Houston's moved across the street to their own new stand alone building. (Who figured out your parking quota???)  They spared no expense as far as making a magnificent 5 star atmosphere presentation... The ambiance of this restaurant is off the charts! If you have a date you want to impress or clients you want to razzle dazzle this place is off the hook. This restaurant is much more formal, so dress well!    So why didn't I give them five stars?   Well I waited for several months before going in, so the hoopla had died down, & they would have a chance to fix any corky things you get with a new establishment! The servers all had the same well trained Houston's' marching army/team getting your dishes to your table as quickly as possible. The only problem was they kept bringing out someone else's dish. I mean the wrong appetizer came out, than the wrong dish, & finally the wrong dessert! The first time I shrugged it off as it happens, but after the second time, I was a little concerned! (I don't like other patrons breathing on my food!)  The Food Quality is exactly the same as all the other Houston's restaurants! They are using prettier dishware than before, & the dishes have smaller portion area on them. My Thai salad was 30% smaller than it used to be in Houston's! (Seriously!!!) The prices did go up again which I didn't like, but you are getting better ambiance. They also added sushi to the menu!  The ambiance, the outside waiting area (Rock Garden with Fire place & Fountain) is very romantic! Great place to have a few drinks with a date before dinner! The Bar is wide open & very loud, a great place to check out members of the opposite sex! A lot of hot cougars congregate here in twos & threes! The restaurant although very noisy is sexy & stylish!  Did I mention the Prices went up!  I use to frequent Houston's several times a week, because I thought it was a great value for the dining experience!  I regularly go there alone for lunch or happy hour & sit @ the bar alone & inevitably meet a friend! I just don't see that happening here.",

I've always enjoyed Houston's and this is no exception.  The sushi rolls are tasty too.  The patio only offers sushi, appetizers and dessert.  The hot fudge sundae is the best in town.  It's a house made hot fudge that isn't actually hot and therefore doesn't turn your ice cream into soup 4 bites in.  Genius!",

Having said that, it is Hillstone (Houston's) and the one thing they are best known for is their impeccable consistency.

We had the mango salmon roll - delicious).  -No need to worry about Valet... lots of parking.  -Great service.  What hasn't changed is the menu and the crowd. Still your 40+ real estate suits - or should I say jeans + a blazer - and all the cougary women that come along with these men... Not knocking it, simply the truth.  Overall, a great place for a good American meal, people watching or to take your parents. This isn't a place you'll be racing to take your friends who just came into town... it's a chain restaurant.

Hopefully they will remedy this, because it's rather disconcerting to be served well across the aisle from a grumpy couple eying me down and complaining amongst themselves.  I'm not sure if I'll return to give it another try. This definitely isn't the Houston's that I remember.

Very impressed with their speed and skill.  Service by a very receptive and friendly waitress.  Wish I'd remembered her name.  Had spinach dip, prime rib and sundae for dessert.  All delicious.  In fact, I'd bet the prime rib was the best I've ever had and I've eaten a lot of prime rib.  Not only a huge portion, perfectly cooked medium rare all the way thru but the horse radish cream was best I've ever had.  Truly a memorable meal.  Spinach dip was delicious with warm chips.  The attention to detail was honestly impressive.  The atmosphere is buzzy and prob a little loud with all the tables talking plus overhead music.  Wine list is very nice with quality wines by the glass and not ridiculously overpriced like so many other restaurants.  I'd return in a heartbeat.  Hillstone will be a regular on my list of restaurants to visit.  Goodness the prime rib was awesome.  Can't stop thinking about it.",

My friend has the Burger and absolutely was obsessed with it. She said the meat was the best burger she's had. Fries are shoestring. If you order a coke, they give you the old school glass bottle with a cup of ice. All fives, all around. Already looking forward to my next meal here!",

Ordered appetizers, spinach dip was overly cheesy blob stuck to the small ramekin. \"Salsa\" was sad resembling \"sauce\" from a tin can - even a glass jar from the grocery would have had more authenticity.  To make matters worse, the wait staff wouldn't allow us to eat in peace! Kept trying to take plates with food on them while we were eating. At these prices I deserve to consume my meal at a reasonable pace! Obviously trying to get another party in our spot. Overall subpar won't be back",

We got a table in about 35 to 40 minutes. I had shaved prime rib au jus \"French Dip\" - excellent, try the creamed horse radish, if you like spicy. My girlfriend had spareribs with fries, and a salad was included. Mine included a side of my choice - I had a large cole slaw that was very flavorful.  It was my first time here, and I was favorably impressed. Service was very attentive. Paid $100 bucks including sales tax and 18% tip; that also included 2 glasses of pleasant red wine. The food was more than we could finish, so no desserts or appetizers were ordered. Enjoy!",

    "text": "I've been to their locations in winter park, FL and west palm, FL both of those experiences were incredible. This would've been an easy 5 star review if it hadn't been for the 20 minute wait on a Thursday night once I showed up for my reservation. Now that we've established that, let's move on to the good part. Arrival 1/5  Everything.  Service: From the ambiance to the attentiveness of the server, the experience was incredible. She did a great job of creating an experience for us on our 1 year anniversary, instead of just \"waiting\" on us. Great energy, calm & smooth presence at the table, 5/5.   Drinks: I usually drink zin, but per her recommendation, I had a couple glasses of cab sauv, she brought over a couple samples and we finally found a winner. My girlfriend ordered an extra dirty martini and when she mentioned it could use a little more olive juice, she brought over a small glass to add instead of removing the drink to have it remade (great call for a simple drink).   Apps & salad: 1) grilled artichokes - smooth and smokey flavor, very simple. 4/5  2) oysters st Charles. First word, fried. The only word I didn't read, fried haha. They still were great and absolutely PACKED full. 4/5 3) Wedge salad - a good wedge salad always comes down to the quality of ingredients, because it's such a simple dish. Thick bacon, rich danish blue cheese, fresh tomatoes 5/5   Entree: We split The Hawaiian - WOW. Pineapple soy-ginger marinade. Lightly charred on the outside, cooked to a perfect medium rare. 5/5  Dessert: Key Lime Pie - what an amazing way to cap off red meat, oysters an artichokes. One of the best key limes I've had. Homemade crust with a touch of cinnamon, smooth yet zesty filling. Delightful. 5/5  Wrapping up: I would like to see more timely seating when it comes to reservation times. Everything else was delightful. 100% chance I'll be returning. Thank you for making our night special!!",

When we arrived without a reservation, the man at the front stated that if we waited 30 seconds longer, we wouldn't have been able to get a table. There is a dress code sign at front desk, which I was unaware of.  The sushi is wonderful and the salad was great. The waitress seemed nice and didn't bother us too much. However I think she was annoyed that my friend and I ordered water and shared a salad. The staff cleared our table and kept bothering us about if we were done and can they clear the plates. Then, one staff member just walked by and took my water glass without asking if I was finished and he asked my friend if he could take her glass and she said no, I actually need a refill.  We hadn't even gotten our bill yet and they are trying to get us out of there.  It was obnoxious.  The staff just keeps circling the tables trying to clear the tables to apparently get you to leave so they can seat other guests quickly.  We felt pressured to hurry and leave. Like, we felt that we couldn't sit and chat. And we had only been there for 45 minutes at the most.  It was very odd. I have never had that happen to me at any other restaurant.  I doubt I will ever return.  The sushi was great but I can go elsewhere for that.",

    "text": "TLDR:  I prefer Houston's over Hillstone.   This was my first time to Hillstone. This place is about twice the size as the Houston's in Scottsdale. We went on a Thursday night and it was going to be about a 45 minute wait. No big deal. The wait seemed a little longer and the manager apologized. You could tell they were slammed and the service was slow.  Overall Service: We got seated and it took about 5-7 minutes for our waitress to come say hi and take our appetizer order. Our waitress was very nice but the team didn't seemed buttoned up like Houston's where they all work together making sure drinks are filled and things are moving a little quicker.  Don't get me wrong I like to dine but this was a long meal due to slow service.  The Food and Beverage: The margaritas and beer were on point. Coconut shrimp roll was yummy and freshly prepared. You have to get this if you go there. The Thai noodle steak salad was great, but it was missing avocado.   Maybe they only do the avocado at Houston's? The filet steak had great flavor. The french dip was just okay. The roll seemed different (more bread) from Houston's and the meat was a little dry and not as shaved and juicy.",

Everything came out faster than I expected and for the quality of the food the price is not bad at all.  In the roll there was tuna, jicama, avocado, cucumber, jalapeno, and spicy mayo and I like to get mine with soy paper. It was perfect. They didn't have soy sauce but instead their own house made sauce.  Kind of similar to a ponzu sauce but so much better that's just the closest comparison I can make. I honestly don't know how I'm going to eat sushi ever again without that sauce!",

You can't go wrong with this appetiser, I could actually live on this! Tender moist intensely smokey.   For dinner i ordered a French dip.

    "text": "My father was taking very important clients out for dinner during spring training. This included the president of a television sports network, tv baseball announcer, general sales manager of the baseball team and tv station, their spouses, and I. He went in personally to make the reservation two weeks before hand to ensure the restaurant staff and location was up to the standards we were seeking. He spoke to the hostess when he went in and ensured they could seat 8 people for this very important dinner. This restaurant was chosen because of our love for the Rutherford Grille in Rutherford, CA. When we arrived for our reservation at 6:00 pm we were greeted with smug remarks and were told that our party would have to be spilt because they would not and \"could not\" seat 8 adults together. They walked up with 2 hostess and directed us that we weren't sitting together. We asked why we were not sitting together and very matter of fact stated that their tables were bolted to the floor and they did not sit large parties. Embarrassed and mortified that we were allowed to make this reservation, we apologized to our clients and sat separately. After our mediocre dinner and 2 $210 bottles of wine, we all squished around one table to finish our last sips of wine. The waiter came over and yelled at us that he would call the police and fire department if we wouldn't move back. Mind you, we were not blocking any fire escapee route or being obnoxious. We just wanted to sit with the clients we weren't allowed to sit with and squeezed around them. We were told to be quiet and move back. One of the clients actually said \"I've never been yelled at by so many waitresses before!\" Finally, they allowed us to move outside where we purchased another $210 bottle of wine to share and we're placed on mismatched heights and tables, with no apologies. No discount on the bill, no dessert, nothing at all. We were treated like 8 high school drunks. Completely disrespectful and felt quite embarrassed that we gave this place our business. On an upside, we were the highlight of the teams ownership party the next night and lots of laughs were had. We will never return to this establishment and have shared our experience with many others to ensure they will not dine here either. Do not give this place your business, it's not worth it!!!",

I have been getting their Classic Caesar Salad with chicken for YEARS and it is the best. I am also in love with their prime rib and loaded baked potato. The sushi is fresh and fabulous too, you really can't go wrong! I know we'll be back soon for another family outing!",

This place is highly overrated..The prime rib was so stringy I took more than half home to give to my dog. The french dip meat was cold and the chicken was dry. I could go on and on about the other dishes we had. We have eaten at every steak eatery in the Valley and I would compare Hillstone the same quality as The Outback. I expect far better service and quality of food at Hillstone. We will not be eating at this establishment any longer.",

I like cozy relaxing places and I feel always very relaxed after 2-3 hour dinner there.  Food - always excellent, especially Thai Salad, sushi, artichokes, chicken, soups... everything I tried was good. Service: on a scale from 1-5: I give them 5+. Coffee is local , from LUX.  The beautiful patio has comfy furniture and a fireplace.  Sometimes you need to wait 45 minutes for a table,  so it is a good idea to avoid the most busy parts of the day.

In fact it fell apart when I picked it up because the pattie wasnt packed very tightly, it would have been much better if ordered on it's own and not in burger form. It was a mess to eat. For veggie burgers Four Peaks is the place to go.  Now the curry corn on the other hand...sweet jesus it was good enough to request as your last meal if you become unfortunate enough to be offered one on Death Row. I was actually irritated that my friend left hers until last because after mine was all gone she had a nice untouched pile just sitting their waiting to be devoured. I was green with envy as she ate each forkful without a care in the world while I salivated.  Houstons I beg you to make this a regular dish!!!",

Imagine my surprise then when we were heading back from hiking at the Grand Canyon and we were tired, covered in clay, starving and in desperate need of food and a drink.  We skipped the idea of even going back to our hotel to shower as it was on the later side (9:45PM).  We drove by Hillstone, I recalled the mostly favorable reviews, it was open so we pulled in.  SO glad we did.  We had such a delightful experience at the bar.  The bartender was awesome....from picking out the perfect french white to his service, we had a great experience.  Best part of the meal...the veggie burger.  Might of been one of the best things I ate while in PHX.  Worst...rainbow roll.  They were out of the roll we wanted and the bartender said this one would be great.  It's not sushi if it's rolled with a thick mayo-crab mixture.  yuck.  I want to taste the fish.

    "text": "Short Version: Consistently awesome service and delicious food. Every time. My favorites: Prime Rib Dip, Thai Steak Salad, Hawaiian Rib Eye, Ribs, California Roll (NOT your typical, trust me) and Chicken Sandwich.  Long Version: Hillstone is consistently busy so get there early (11:30 for lunch or 5:30 for dinner) to avoid a wait.  I have a friend who makes fun of me for this because he likes supporting the small local restaurants, but I'll say it again. Hillstone is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale. I come very frequently for lunch and on nights out with my wife for dinner. I'd say I've been to Hillstone 15-20 times in the last few months alone. Every. Single. Time. the service is awesome. And again, every single time, the food is awesome.   My favorites for lunch are the Prime Rib Dip (Best French Dip I've ever had) which, as the name suggests, uses slices of Prime Rib. It's no joke. The Au Jus is awesome too. If I want something a LITTLE lighter, and I say a little, because it still has steak in it, I get the Thai Steak Salad.  For dinner we typically get the Hawaiian Rib Eye and I recently discovered how awesome the ribs are, so I'll be throwing that in the mix too. Since it's dinner, we usually get the California Roll as an appetizer. I'm a big sushi fan, so I understand when every person I eat with is hesitant when I suggest the California Roll. It's truly unique and doesn't taste anything remotely close to the traditional \"newbie\" sushi roll everyone thinks of. Just try it. Also, when it's on season, we will get the grilled artichoke.  5/5 for service and 5/5 for food. Definitely a rare one. I'm sure I'm a bigger fan boy than most and have become biased.",

    "text": "Chose Hillstone because we have always enjoyed the sister restaurant Houstons and were very impressed.   From the contemporary decor to the friendly staff to the delicious food Hillstone hit the mark.  The ribs were so tender with just the right sauce and seasoning, and the Hawaiian Ribeye was so flavorful.     We were completely blown away when the friendly person who seated us came back mid-meal and introduced herself as the general manager, then told us that dinner was her treat!  WOW! This has never happened to us before and we eat out a lot.  We are so grateful for her generosity. She has earned our loyalty and we will be recommending Hillstone to all.",

Instead of being greeted by the host staff, Carol walked up to me and announced that my stroller won't fit in the restaurant and that she would have to take it in the back.  What?  Ok...  This Britax B-Ready apparently warranted a scolding.  Carol was so incredibly rude and my stroller would have easily fit at a table- minus a chair.  What exactly is their procedure for wheelchairs or other special needs devices?  Do they simply not fit or are they not pleasing enough to the eye to accommodate?  They might want to come up with a better story and take a more discerning eye to the host staff.  I've always had such great experiences here in the past; what a disappointment.  We'll be over at Chelsea's.  They're cool with my wheels.",

I eat the coleslaw, which is unlike any I have eaten before, fresh, not drowned in mayo, and very good.   I typically order the salmon, which at $27.00 for a relatively small portion with baked potato is overpriced. My kids always have the burgers, which are very good.   Lots of leather, pleasant lighting (Hillstone/Houstons tends to be darker). We go perhaps 2/3 times a year, and I cannot remember seeing the same waiter twice.   Patio is real popular, firepits and comfortable chairs.   There are plenty of eats in the area go couple of miles East or West on Camelback, Chelsea's kitchen, Postinos, Grand Orange, St. Francis. All worthy of consideration.",

The soup was Tortilla soup and it was very tasty.  Not too spicy, lots of delicious bean taste and some nice sized chunks of fresh avocado floating in it.  My companion saw it and had to order some for himself.  The \"traditional salad\" was even better.  Fresh greens, freshly cooked bacon and croutons - everything was delicious and tasty.  The best salad I've eaten in memory.  Also a very generous serving - I couldn't finish it after the soup.  We ate at the bar and the service from the bartender was very friendly and quick and I'll be back.",

The diet coke was soooo refreshing and the server was on it for refills! It was 110+ degrees out so OMG I needed a great thirst quencher!   I thought the food was fabulous and the service was pretty good! :-) Great spot for a business lunch too!",

I've been to other Houston's locations in California - and have had decent times there.  In fact, I love the thai steak salad.   However, this time some 20 year old idiot host walked us to our table (and before we even sat down) and told us \"My mom taught me good manners, so I've always taken my hat off at the dinner table.\"    Huh?  First of all, I was dressed nicely in a button up shirt, and was wearing my favorite football team hat who had just won the championship the day before.  Secondly, I hadn't even sat down at the table yet, asswipe.  Thirdly, while I understand this isn't Applebees, this also isn't Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, douche bag.  And don't talk to me like I'm 7 years old.  No sooner had the idiot host left before we walked into the kitchen to get the manager  to bitch him out about his insulting employee.  The manager was pretty much dismissive.  Well, guess what - I'm pretty much dismissive about this poor excuse for a restaurant.   1 STAR - not going back!!",

The moment we arrived the customer service we received was above a beyond , it was a busy evening and we got sat on the patio and was told it would be a while so we ordered drinks and an app. About 25 minutes or so went by and we were enjoying the evening and drinks so we were perfectly fine , one of the managers came by to apologize and said they were waiting for a party to leave and would have a table shortly we said no worries and contained talking and enjoying talking . 15 minutes or so went by and they came to apologize once again and said it would be soon , within minutes they came back and said just a few more minutes so we asked for the bill . Our waiter came by and said management tool care if the bill which was not necessary but a very nice gesture . We were taken to our table and and proceeded to look at the menu and order drinks and apps once again , shortly some apps we had not ordered we deliver to the table and we said they were not ordered by us , the runner said its from management .. Wow this was so not expected and very generous !! We ordered and had a great time and once again was taken by surprise when we were brought some dessert on the house as well , the customer service there is far above and beyond and mind you we never felt like we waited too long or had any issue at all there with the staff or the meal . Our meals that night we're outstanding and felt like we were treated like kings , it's now a place we tell everyone about and a place we all speak of fondly and will always patronize !! It's so nice to know there are people like at hill stone that are so concerned about there customers , we are moving back to Phoenix from San Diego at the end of the month and can't wait to go make Hill Stone a regular place to eat !!",

The tuna was cooked perfectly and not smothered in black pepper like you find in most places.

I'm convinced people eat at Houston's because it's at the Biltmore, everyone wears their church clothes, and the decor is pretty nice.

The french fries are the crispiest I have ever had, they are shoestring.  Not many people do shoestring anymore, probably b/c they'll clog all your arteries in one serving.  One thing I don't like about Houston's is that they do no accept reservations with 5 or more people-- that is lame.  We had to wait for a table for awhile but we sat out on the patio and enjoyed beverages, so that was nice.  It wasn't so hot yet that it didn't feel like torture. But it will be torture next weekend.   Another meal I always enjoy is the rotisserie chicken and the vegetable plate.  I wish I could prepare a vegetable plate like that at home b/c then maybe I would eat more veggies.   Service is always good.  The dark atmosphere is very relaxing as well.",

I quick search of yelp didn't really turn up anything definitive, so I turned to my kids, who suggested Houston's. I was leaning toward AZ 88's waffle fries (which I still want . . . ).  Houston's fries are very, very thin and crispy; not overtly seasoned, but not especially potato-y tasting. The were good-enough and satisfying; I prefer a thicker potato.  To accompany the fries, I ordered the veggie bean burger. This is an excellent burger and if I had not tasted the Fez bean burger, I would rate this very highly. This burger also is stuffed with veggies and grains, in addition to beans,  and lacks the rich bean taste that the Fez bean burger has. It was a good choice, just not the best bean burger in town.  Service at Houston's is always exceptional. The server tolerated our jokes extremely well and dished out a few of her own. My kids enjoyed their meals too - a bit more than me.",

    "text": "I frequent Houston's for dinner.  My office is in the Esplanade and I can walk there after work.    As a favor to some of the previous reviewers, here are a few tips.  1.  Please be mindful of the placard at the entrance of the restaurant.  Hats, cut-off jeans, swim wear, sleeveless shirts, and cell phones are not allowed.  You may be able to get away with the cell phone; the dress code is strictly enforced.  Houston's is a unique restaurant that has a vast client base due to its ambience and food quality.  They respectfully request you to not wear your \"sweat pants\" and find a pair of jeans and polo.    2.  Houston's has an innovative approach to service.  You do not have one waiter, you have a team of waiters.  This is to ensure your glass is always full an your well take care off.  Do not be offended if you see multiple servers.  As long as your being well taken care off, who cares?  They have an amazing veggie plate that includes fresh seasonal steamed veggies.  It changes frequently, but I am a huge fan.    If you are in the mood for a steak, Houston's is a great place to be.  Another personal favorite.",

    "text": "We had dinner at Hillstone a couple nights ago.  The food was, for the most part, pretty good.  However, the service was below average.  They really need to work on training their servers better or they will lose a lot of potential repeat business.   We showed up at 7:30 and our reservation was for 8pm.  We seated ourselves on the outdoor patio (which was very nice as far as scenery/ambience).  It was awhile before a server came over to take our drink orders; we saw her go by/near tables next to us twice before she finally came over.  She made us feel rushed from the get-go; as if she was in a hurry -- it was a little strange for the relaxed atmosphere and mode we were in.  She brought us our drinks - never offered water - and when she didn't come back for awhile, my husband got up to get me water from the bar.  She soon brought a check over and we at that point said we'd like to order an appetizer.  Again, she seemed a little \"put out\" by us, but took the order.  When we were halfway through our spinach dip, at about 7:50, a hostess came over and moved us indoors to our table that was \"ready.\". It would have been much nicer to finish the appetizer where we were, and then have us move inside, rather than transporting everything.  Kind of strange.  There were also several tables inside - it wasn't packed with a line of people waiting or anything.  Once inside, our next server (this seemed like #3 already, of what would be about 6 total servers throughout our evening) came by and was sort of awkward - saw we had half eaten spinach dip and said \"looks like your all set, I'll let you enjoy that,\" without asking if there was anything else we needed at that time...again, no offer of WATER!  I asked for ice water, and she then looked to my husband...\"Did you want some, too?\"...OF COURSE.  Isn't that just a matter of course here in Phoenix, early September?  We were asked within a couple of minutes if we were ready to order and we hadn't even picked up the menus yet...we were talking, eating spinach dip, having drinks...again, very much a RUSHED feeling. We ordered ribs which come with \"hand cut potato fries and coleslaw.\" I said I would prefer a baked potato instead of hand cut fries.  The server's EXACT response: \"Okay.\"  Pause... \"But then you won't get the coleslaw either.  The baked potato counts as two sides.\" Um, okay...I suddenly felt like I was ordering at a fast food restaurant.  Blown away.  I said nothing; I really didn't care about having coleslaw anyways.  My husband next ordered, also with a baked potato replacing the fries, but he said \"And I'd like to have my coleslaw please.\"  Server response: \"Okay, it will be $4.00 for the coleslaw.\" Again, wow.  Where am I?  Certainly not an upscale restaurant...can we supersize here??!  Our ribs were good; we were enjoying the food (again, for the most part...good, not great).  What happened next however, was that no less than 3 random servers came by in about a 12 minute period, none of whom were our original server, asking if we were done and if they could take our plates.  We were so far from done - I had about 75% of my meal still on my plate and my husband, while he was almost done with his ribs, was still working on the baked potato and the $4.00 *supposed to be included with meal* coleslaw.  It was so incredibly annoying; they kept interrupting our conversation and what was trying to be a relaxing, enjoyable evening out.  We finally gave in and said we were done (server number 6 asking)...who were these people?  Why isn't one server and one busser assigned to each table?  That way the same question wouldn't be asked 6 times...they've got to work on this.  Yet a different server came to see if we wanted anything else; my husband had to ASK for a dessert menu (it was not offered), and when he asked, server #7 (?) pretty much ignored the question and said \"Let me tell you...\" and started rambling off I think four different desserts.  This would be fine, I suppose (even though I really prefer to read it from a menu and make my decision...a little more time, less pressure..) but we couldn't understand what she was saying was on top of the hot fudge sundae.  The place is a little loud...my husband asked her to repeat it, we both still missed it...I asked again...\"What's on top of the sundae?\" And again, we both missed it.  Could not understand..whatever, this is why I'd like a dessert menu to READ.  I finally said, \"We'll have the key lime pie,\" because we both still had no clue what might come on top of that sundae if we ordered it!  The key lime pie was disappointing.  We shared a piece and between the two of us we did not even finish half of it.  The crust had cinnamon in it, which tasted so wrong with key lime pie.  The kind of crust you would use for a pumpkin pie.    All in all, not rushing back to Hillstone anytime soon.  They have got to work on the wait staff.  Too many people involved in our meal throughout the night and obviously not in a good way.",

Sometimes we go just for tortilla soup & toast & they still serve you as if the ticket were $200.   If you haven't tried this place, you are truly missing a great experience........one of the finest dining establishments in the Valley! Great food, at a reasonable price & the BEST service you will ever get anywhere! Tell them Russ & Tracy sent you!",

We are huge fans of both Huston's and Bandera, so we looked forward to dining here. The ambiance is great. I think it has one of the best patios in town.   We arrived and they were on a 15 minute wait. We sat down at the bar for a drink and no one waited on us. We finally had to flag someone down, even though a bar staff was standing two feet away from us. Our drinks were delivered on time, but we were given the wrong check, which meant we had to wait again.   We were seated and our waiter arrived right away. It was awkward because the lamp came down so low we couldn't see his face. It was like we were talking a headless body. We ordered dinner and he didn't ask if we wanted salads to start.   When the food came out, he set the plates down and walked away. Didn't ask if we needed anything else, or check to see if everything looked fine. The food was okay. Not the best. Definitely not Huston's quality. My tuna was medium, and it should have been rare. My husband had a good steak, but it was nothing to write home about.   I honestly felt like the waiter was already cut and trying to get out for the night. He really rushed us through dinner and didn't try to up sell anything.   Overall, we didn't fall in love with it. We did love the patio, so think this may be a happy hour spot only.",

Fortunately I knew Hillstone has the same Hawaiian steak, my hubby's favorite,  plus they were also open later than Houston's. Service was delightful and our server, without mentioning it beforehand, brought out a little dish of some kind of garlicky buttermilk spread. She said it goes well with our cheesy toast appetizer, which it deliciously did! It was also good with my hubby's steak. I had the Thai noodle mango salad with steak, also like Houston's. Simply delicious!",

    "text": "Wow, some of the review here are really harsh. I had an excellent experience at Hillstone and cannot wait to go back.  We arrived to a full dining room and went to the bar to have drinks. Within five minutes, the host found us and offered us a table. We had to decline, as we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. The bartender was awesome and the regulars she knew seemed to really have a connection with her. When hubby finished his drink and declined another she brought a glass of water over for him so he'd have something. Awesome. The bar vibe is great.  Our table was a cozy L shape booth with awesome lighting. Our server was awesome and knew the menu well enough to answer our questions. She was always around when we wanted her but never too talky.   The food was great. We started with the pressed sushi--heaven! I cant wait to have it again. The pressing takes the place of the nori to hold the roll together. Never had it before, cant wait to have it again. The caesar salad was good, croutons were a little too crunchy, but they were underneath everything instead of on top---brilliant. The green salad was a little heavily dressed but very good.  Entrees? The NY steak was sex on a plate. The fries were what you'd expect but that steak was perfectly seared and topped with delicious olive and shallot deliciousness. The fish special was amazing too. Cooked to perfection, moist, tasty, and the fillets were still attached to each other and the tail, which let us know they came from 1 fish and recently.  Dessert was the ice cream sundae which was surprisingly well executed except for the fudge--which should have been hotter. The coffee was good too, nice finish.   The only criticism was the server picked up the finished check, a huge faux pas in my book. Leave it on the table, dont rush your guests.  Hillstone is high on my list to return to and bring my out of town guests to. Bravo.",

    "text": "This place is misleading, and not in a bad way. You pull up to a joint next to the Ritz Carlton.... valet park your car, walk in to a dimly lit swanky area and sit down. Open up the menu and whoa - this place is not as expensive as it looks.  I wasn't sure what to order. I'd been eating steak for the last few days and I was wondering if I should do fish or something else... it was a really interesting menu - lotsa different choices. My first instinct was to go with something safe and order a french dip - it's my favorite sandwich. But I also didn't want just meat and starch, so I got the Thai Steak and Noodle salad instead. It sounded pretty good. I also ordered a Hefferveisen - the last time I had one was on Venice beach with a good high school friend of mine and I remember really enjoying it - even though I'm not much of a beer drinker. The Hefferveisen they brought out was disgusting. No idea where it was brewed. it looked fresh, but tasted like rubbing alcohol. BLEH.  And the thai steak and noodle salad - the first few bites we ok, but it was just a mash-up of all things that might be thai with some avocado in it. It, too was gross. So much so, that I actually sent it back. This is not something I generally do, but I absolutely could not eat it and I was still hungry! So I asked them to bring out something safe: the french dip.  The french dip was good and the fries that came with it were good.   Don't go to Houston's if you're looking for cultural fare. Go there for their American fare. That's what they tout and that's what they're good at.",

We started out with the grilled artichoke and it was good (it's not on the menu) but I think the grilled artichokes at Wally's and North are better. We had a party of 7, and 3 people ordered the French Dip Sandwich with fries. Their fries are killer (really thin and yummy), and everyone seemed pleased with the sandwich (at $17 or $18, I wouldn't think of it). Two in our party had the Thai Steak and Noodle Salad ($16) and I was tickled when I tasted it (still, a salad for $16...NOPE!). I ordered the Smoked Salmon starter as my entree ($12) and had a side of their braised red cabbage with goat cheese (to-die-for at any cost). The salmon was okay, but I personally think it needs to be smoked a little longer... All in all, it's a good restaurant with impeccable service.  Still, those prices seem a little steep to me....",

My husband had the cheeseburger.  Very good.  My friend and I both ordered the Ahi Tuna.  I used to go to Houston's all the time and order the Ahi salad.  Now, the lettuce is primarily cabbage, presentation was mediocre, and the dressing just wasn't the same.  Th part that bothered me most was the abundance of cabbage.  I guess maybe it holds up longer, but does not taste as good.  At one time it was $14, now it has crept up to $25.  If I want the Ahi Tuna Salad, I now go to J Alexander's because they have done an excellent job of emulating the old Houston's Ahi.  By the way, server was excellent.  Hillstone's and their organization seem to train and insist on great service, and they do a good job.",

I thought, the food must at least warrant this and took a look at the menu. Everything I saw was priced like nothing I had seen before. Nothing I saw on the menu seemed at all worth the price, but I tried it anyway and my initial thoughts were justified. I will not be back to try anything else.   Try another restaurant in the area.

I gave this place 4 stars basically for the service and the ambiance. The food is a little above average but nothing to impress.  The service is kind and the decoration of the place is really pleasant.  A good place for a date or friends and family, although a little over priced (for the food).  Cheers.",

Our server was very sweet, but almost non existent. My boyfriend ordered the filet (which is his favorite in all of Arizona) and I ordered the salmon. Although the filet was seasoned so perfectly, the salmon was bland and fishy. A few times throughout our dining experience here, our water was empty. Unpleasant experience when you spend $93 on dinner. I most likely won't be back.",

We had the Rainbow roll sushi to start and it was the best we've ever had, the tenderloin I had for dinner was remarkable in that it too was the best I've had. I'm on a permanent mission to find a steak better than I can make at home; from Manhattan NY, to Chicago,  Miami, Denver, Calgary and beyond,  I've not met my match until NOW. I'm only sad it's in another state from my home. Bravo Hillstone!",

Please don't ever take it away!  Their roasted chicken entree is also amazing. We always order the same things because we crave it.

We asked what he recommended, and he pretty must listed everything on the menu. Lol.  We chose this place based on reviews, and we were so glad we did. The food was delicious. My co-worker ordered the Thai Sushi Roll with the side salad, and she said it was the best meal she had in the two weeks we were in Phoenix. The roll had avocado and macadamia nuts. The salad had kale. I ordered the veggie burger, and I enjoyed it. It came with fries.  The place was filled with lots of people from surrounding businesses. All the men were in button up shirts and the ladies in nice slacks and skirts. I liked the atmosphere. It was very social, and the place was lively.",

    "text": "When you have impeccable service and phenomenal food, you will always have my attention and adoration. THIS place is my fave spot for every excuse possible to frequent it. It hits the mark every time. I love sitting at the bar or patio area because Hillstone just attracts quite the crowd of movers and shakers because what's the fun in a staring contest.   Definitely start with the house-smoked salmon. That in itself could be your entire meal with a couple of glasses of wine, but then I would be short changing you a review of their offerings wouldn't I? On a side note, always order the grilled artichokes if they are available. It will seriously ooze goodness all over your mouth. The last thing I think about is salad at a steakhouse, but I will say that the Blue Cheese Wedge Salad,  Chicken Kale Salad or the Yellowtail Sashimi Salad are my fave side dishes to accompany the Hawaiian Rib Eye, or the Prime Rib.   Here's the crazy thing. They have sushi and I haven't even tried that because I am so smitten by the other choices. Says a lot for me to give 5 stars without trying everything.  I actually will have to venture back strictly for that feasting. While their sister restaurant Houston is a fave, Hillstone takes the spotlight. It sits in a class of its own, maybe because every outing has always left me with a dazzling smile. Parking can be nuts but I promise it's worth the walk and you'll appreciate the stroll after gorging on their culinary delights.",

I can get the same type of food at many nearby (local) restaurants  for less, so I typically do. I have been to Houston's many times and enjoyed it, but, again, the price point (and location) keeps it from my regular rotation. I ended up eating at Hillstone with my father and grandmother one day for lunch.  We all split the french dip, the crispy chicken sandwich, fries, the cashew, kale, and chicken salad and some spinach artichoke dip (we definitely ordered too much). The food was actually very tasty and the portions were large. The spinach dip was sort of a waste, I wouldn't order that again. The chicken sandwich was decent. The salad was awesome, very flavorful and satisfying for a salad. The real star, though, was the french dip. I don't even like french dips, and I loved this one. The fries, of course, are crispy and delightful (like Houston's). If you have extra money to burn, this isn't a bad place to spend it, I just can't imagine myself regularly buying a 20$ sandwich.",

My personal favorite is the Hawaiian Ribeye, that amazing marinade punches you with tons of delicious flavor. The Baked Potato is also delicious. With this restaurant nothing seems to disappoint we have ordered several different plates over the years such as the ribs, chicken, tuna sushi, French Dip Sandwich, Spinach Dip and everything is just splendid.

My brother and I came here for a sushi lunch and were greeted by a hostess in a black cocktail dress with the appropriate jewelry.  She led us past the station where we could see the sushi chefs creating artistic masterpieces and finally deposited us at a dimly lit table that felt secluded even though there were other tables all around us.  This beautifully decorated restaurant has mastered the feel of Old World elegance.  They appear to achieve this effortlessly, though I'm sure it is not as easy as it seems.  The menu does discreetly remind you to do your part \"Please refrain from using cell phones in the dining room.\"  The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to accurately describe how each type of sushi was made.  My brother and I were saddened to hear that they did not have their famous artichokes on the menu at this time of year.  The waitress let us know that the artichokes produced by their supplier were better at a different time of the year and would be back on the menu when their high standards were met.  We started our lunch with an order of fresh guacamole, salsa, and corn chips. The salsa and guacamole were beautifully constructed and it was easy to tell they were freshly made that day.  They were gone in no time at all  Our waitress was quite solicitous \"Would you like some warm towels before your sushi?\"  Why, yes, we would.  She brought us warm damp towels to freshen our hands with and chilled bowls for our soy sauce.  We felt quite well taken care of as she unobtrusively came and went.  My brother exclaimed \"She is a ninja\" at one point as she took dirty dishes and unneeded silverware aware without drawing our notice.  I ordered the Thai tuna thai roll which was beautifully plated in a diamond pattern and accompanied by several dipping sauces.  I tried the rolls with and without the sauces and every bite was like a revelation.  Truly the best sushi I have ever had.  My brother, Josh, ordered one of the pressed sushi rolls paired with a kale and cashew salad.  I tasted one of the pressed sushi rolls and it was as magnificent as my rolls had been.  Luckily for me, my brother is not big on kale, so I talked him into letting me have his salad.  The kale and cashew salad was simply amazing and was definitely worthy of being its own main dish.  Unfortunately, we did not save room for dessert on this visit, but I would like to come back when the artichokes are in season and promise to save room for the dessert next time!  This is a very classy (dressy) restaurant, but it is Phoenix so casual is also an acceptable option.  Most of the people in the restaurant when we were there were dressed in suits or designer dresses, but my brother and I were dressed very casually (we went hiking after lunch) and were treated with just as much respect as those who were dressed more appropriately.",

    "text": "I enjoy going to Cherry Creek Grill/Hillstone/Houston's, because even though they have somewhat limited (albeit absolutely delicious) menu, the service is always impeccable. Unfortunately, such was not the case last night. I found my water glass completely empty on more than one occasion, and we never got the extra ramekin of condiment, because we didn't get a chance to ask for it - our server didn't come around while we were having our entrees, and the other servers walked so quickly past us, we couldn't flag anyone down to pass on the request either. The NY strip feature also had 3 end pieces, and I couldn't help but think that it was somehow \"Frankenstine-d\" together to meet the 8oz minimum. Having worked in a high-end steakhouse myself, I should've known better than to order the \"feature.\" Oh well. Overall, it was a very underwhelming visit. I don't think I'll be in a hurry to return, at least not this location.",

It was a little bitter. Disappointing. Several friends really like this place",

Nice cocktails and had flash fried brussels sprouts and the crispy oysters both of which were terrific! It is the first time I have ever seen a fried oyster served on the half shell. Very creative. a slightly older crowd as might be expected. They have a li mites menu that covers most of the bases. This Resto is owned by the same folks that own Houston's and you will recognize a few menu items that are Houston's staples like the Hawaiian ribeye. They do not do happy hour specials but the place is very very good and we will return!",

The ribeye has a nice flavor to it, it reminds me of a more upscale version of a Thai bbq pork. I usually start with their house salad -- it is one of the best salads I've had. I order the brussels sprouts as a side if available -- I wish they would keep that on their menu. Love the atmosphere whenever I visit!",

Son #1 had hamburger- happy. Son #2 had ribs- #awesome. I had the ahi tuna and it was the best I ever had and wife had the chicken. The deserts were delicious and the wine was perfect - thanks for recommendation.   Noisy place, but it wasn't so noisy for conversation. Locals obviously love it here. Talked to a woman who has been going for 15 years - got all our food recommendations from her. We'll be back next time in AZ.",

This is the kind of place where people who don't know congregate to make you think they do know. Pompous and pretentious, they even feel that allowing overly made-up dyed blondes to sound condescending only makes their locale upscale. No, it does not. The parking is unacceptable and there is no valet. The run-of-the-mill look of darkness and wood is there to hide the small space they allot to their diners. The menu is not exciting and they SO want you to think it is. Again, the place where people who don't know go in hopes of making one think they do. They do pour a good drink. Perhaps if you want a drink and want to people watch, this might be a choice. But with all the marvelous food and great people in Phoenix, this isn't for anyone.",

Unless you're a regular you may not notice, but suddenly they are now serving smaller drinks, less olives in martinis, not supplying you a fresh cold glass at your table if they see you're still nursing your drink, and... after years of gorgeous lush lilies in the women's bathroom there are now weeds that look like they are from Trader Joe's. We've seen a drop in service as well -- don't see many of their longterm staff there anymore, and takes longer to get any attention. My husband and I have been coming here for years as our weekly date night, and last few times we agreed it just wasn't the same special experience. Food still great, but I'm heartbroken as I always set Hillstone as the standard for other restaurants to meet, and talked about it often. Now they are a low 4 out of 5. Hillstone please come back.

I had a quick visit the other day, just to catch a quick bite. Ordered my favorite appetizer which is the spinach/artichoke dip. They've really raised the price. What was a $9 item a few years ago is now $14!  This time it was really bland. If not for the salsa, it would have been completely tasteless.  For the money, at least cook fresh chips to go with (if Mexican places can do it, so can you!). Instead they give blah chips from a bag.  Service when you are by yourself is always a challenge, but at the prior Houston's it NEVER was. There you were always treated well, no matter how many in your party. I have noticed a real attitude from servers at Hillstone's when you are by yourself. Even in the bar area. This has been going on for many years but now that the food quality and taste is going down, there really is no reason to go here and pay the really high prices.  This has been my favorite place for so long, but not anymore.  I hope they get their sh*t together and fast.  Go back to who you used to be as a restaurant. There are many bad places, but not enough good.  We need Hillstone to shape up!",

The restaurant is nicer by Phoenix standards and has respectful, professional (though not necessarily friendly) service.   The french dip and ribs are especially good, as are their drinks. Appetizers are a bit small-portioned in my opinion, but are still tasty. Waits on busy nights can get a bit long, so be prepared to wait and have some drinks.

Their prices don't reflect the level of class you get while dining here, which makes it a great place to come on a regular for date nights or just a work lunch.    The service staff here and hostesses are second to none when it comes to class.  You can appreciate the level of attentiveness you get from any one walking by your table.  Little things like someone picking up a used sugar packet that's on the table or to clear a plate at a moments notice the second it's no longer needed.  Their food is just as perfect as their service! Any one of their burgers are always cooked to perfection and are always delicious.  Their crispy chicken sandwich on their lunch menu, oh man, this thing is probably one of the best chicken sandwiches you'll ever have in your life.  I think you can order it during dinner but it's not on the menu (Pro tip)  The chili here when it's on the menu is a must try.  Their Ribs, the steaks, Even their salads are amazing.

    "text": "My son has been bugging us and he had this craving for Houston's ribs. I know they are really good but..... Houston's only takes reservations for four or less. Otherwise, you got to wait and wait. So what does someone do? Well we found out that Hillstone is a sister restaurant to Houston's with the same menu but they take reservations for more than 4. Yeah.   So we walk in and it reminds me so much of Houston's. Open kitchen. Pretty wide open and dimly lit. Fairly loud but quiet enough that you can hear and talk to everyone at your table.   We started off with the Warm Spinach & Artichoke Dip. It comes with tortilla chips, the dip and plus salsa and sour cream. The star is the spinach/Artichoke Dip. Since we had six people they gave us extra chips which I thought was great. I really love that Dip. It's so good. Just enough to wet your lips.   So I ordered the Hawaiian which is a ribeye marinated in some special Hawaiian sauce. The ribeye was so good. Tender and moist. The marinated made it really sweet. Really enjoyed it. It comes with a fully loaded baked potato. Hugh meal and very filling but really good. Loved it.   My wife got the barbecued baby back ribs and that's why I got the Hawaiian cause I knew I could get a taste of their famous ribs. Their ribs are fall off the bone goodness. I know fall off bones ribs are boiled but they are so good too. It comes with coleslaws and fries but my wife switched the fires for a kale salad. Like I said she loved the ribs and so did my son and daughter. Hahaha. They got what they were craving. Rib goodness.   So we always have to get the dessert. It's always a must. They only had a few choices and it's not on the menu. Our server had to explain their dessert menu. We got the walnut Apple cobbler. This was so good. Nice and warm apple cobbler with walnuts and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Not too sweet but dessert goodness. We shared and everyone loved it.   The service was pretty good. Our server was really busy but tried to stay on top of us. We had to ask a few times for water refills but she was good and helpful.   So I would say a nice ambiance, great food, good service and of course they take reservations for parties of 6. So if you have a big party and want Houston's, go to Hillstone. Just as good. Consistently good just as Houston's. So we enjoyed. We will be back again. Hope you do too.",

They probably are better known for seafood than steaks.   I recently enjoyed a meal with my  wife and another couple. Let me be honest. The four of us are \"food snobs\" and we are rarely satisfied. Hillstone and our server Janey hit a home run. The wives had salmon and the men ate filet mignon. The filet mignons were cooked an exact mid-rare were not sitting too long. The salmon seemed fresh and was cooked perfectly as well. Seasoning was spot on for both the proteins and the garnishes.  The entre's came with sides which is more than we expect for the price at a top caliber venue. The cocktails were generous pours and the bartender required no coaching to get them right. Janey's service was professional, attentive, and fun.  All in all, I think Hillstone should be a part of any food snob's rotation.",

    "text": "Hillstone is an exceptional restaurant. First thing that I will say is that this restaurant was crazy packed on a Monday during lunch. I would definitely make a reservation for this place regardless of the day and time you come. Service was very attentive and professional. We started off with the smoked salmon appetizer. The salmon had a great Smokey flavor and the sauce that it was served with was tangy and completed the salmon well. My all time favorite dish that we ordered was the Hawaiian. This rib eye steak was honestly one of the best steaks I've had. So flavorful from the marinade and the charcoal flavor from the grill was on point. It was cooked beautifully as well. It came with a side of crispy fries too which was awesome. We tried about 4 different sushi rolls and while they were good, I felt like they were very overpriced. Their lemonade is homemade and really tasty. The Thai noodle salad was also delicious. Super fresh and bold flavors and really unique. Loved the mango in it as well. I would definitely be giving this restaurant a 5 star but the sushi was slightly a downfall in my opinion. The cobbler at the end of the meal was good, not great, but it was a good way to end the meal. Would love to come back and try the French dip. Make sure you get the Hawaiian!",

    "text": "Welcome to Houston's with a happy Hillstone hat on! One thing that always bothered me about the former Houston's was how dark and dreary it could be, but that is definitely not the case with Hillstone. I absolutely love the architecture, location and openness of this building. It's fresh and airy with plenty of large windows, an open patio, and rock finishing. The restaurant seating isn't cramped and you've got plenty of room to relax and enjoy the meal with those you came with and not 20 other strangers.   Before I got to Hillstone, I read up on the yelp reviews and noticed Kat S's note about the ice cubes. So, when I sat down and ordered my Diet Coke, the first thing I glanced at were the ice cubes and Kat's right! They are old fashioned and pretty great! They are the type of ice cubes they place in whiskey to make sure they don't crush when they are dropped in, but I also think they make the soda pour without fizzing up.   So now I will move on to the meal. The reviews are right in saying that this is exactly like the Houston's menu but with a nice improvement. I ordered the rotisserie chicken sandwich with the couscous. Warning: the sandwich is huge and way too big for one lunch, but that could be a good thing if you want to have the other half for lunch. We didn't have dessert but I glanced at the menu and while they have several of the Houston's signatures, I think they should add apple crisp to the list.   I will definitely be back to Hillstone and think this is a nice addition to the area.",

I'm not sure why they used the name Hillstone's and not Houston's when it's exactly the same, but I'm sure there was some corporate marketing decision-making involved. Our hotel concierge recommended Hillstone because we wanted steak but didn't want to pay Mastro's or Ruths Chris prices.  There is a nice patio and we wanted to sit there, but they don't serve the full menu there. Inside it looked exactly like every Houston's I've been to -- dark, kind of crowded, lots of booths. The menu is small and we ended up not having steak after all. Looking at the menu I remembered that I liked Houston's French dip, so I had that. Our party also had a burger and one of the noodle salads.  Everyone was happy enough with the food. Our server was not so great. He was so meek we could hardly hear him. We ordered the spinach dip appetizer, but after awhile I feared he hadn't heard placed the order so I asked. He hadn't put the order in, but once he did it came quickly and he comped it, so that worked out ok. We were also missing a drink when the drinks came. After a couple little blips like that it kind of ruins the meal because you're wondering what else is going to go wrong. But once the food came we were happy.",

Bad table, bad snooty waitress, disconnected Scottsdale dude who managed the place went through the motions when we walked out prior to getting our main courses. I have never been made to feel like I wasn't welcome somewhere by a server until that time. I told the waitress (who was the cause of 90% of our bad experience) that we were not staying to continue to be treated like this. She suddenly became very worried we were going to \"tell\" on her. It didn't matter much anyway because as soon as I started telling the space-case manager what was wrong, he didn't even let me finish my first sentence before trying to buy my silence with gift cards, etc. I know they are a great looking restaurant and they have good food, but you are NO better than the people you serve, so remember that.

    "text": "Us 3 girls went for an early dinner here last Saturday night.  The service was horrible (more on that in a moment)  but the food and wine more than made up for it.  L had the trout special which was huge, seasoned impeccably and so flaky it melted in your mouth. P had the French Dip which is Houston's/Hillstone's signature sandwich.  It didn't disappoint.   However, both of my friends wished they had ordered my selection - the Hawaiian Ribeye.  OMG- I was in steak heaven! Imagine a prime cut of boneless ribeye- rubbed in pineapple and \"Hawaiian\" spices - don't know what the spices were - all I can say it was one of the best steaks I have ever had in my entire life (and I have had many great steaks). The description initially was a little weird for me but the final product- food for the gods!  Back to the service.  When we first arrived a very knowlegeable and cheerful waitress explained the menu and specials, took our appetizer and drink orders.  She disappeared and several minutes later a male waiter appeared stating that his co-worker had covered for him until he arrived.  He took our meal order and disappeared........ literally.   About 30 minutes later a third waitress - who did not smile and had no personality, delivered our food but forgot our drinks.  10 minutes later she brought out my companions drinks but forgot mine.  Seriously, it took another 10-15 minutes before I could find someone to flag down and ask what happened to my drink.  A couple minutes later it arrived via the robot waitress without an apology or any word at all.  Had it not been for the amazing chefs in the kitchen working their miracles I would have given this place one star.    I personally thanked the chef who prepared my steak - he was very humble and appreciative.  I then explained about the service snafus to the manager who apologized .   I definitely will return to Hillstone if only for the amazing food.  Hopefully - the service will be much improved.",

From what I understand, Hillstone is an amped-up Houston's, like a luxury badge on a Marriot hotel. Yawn.   I tell you all this because heading into my first visit to Hillstone tonight I had zero expectations. None. Well, other than expecting to be underwhelmed.  Shame on me, because Hillstone hit a home run.  A beautifully appointed, thoughtfully designed, approachably classy  indoor/outdoor dining venue, Hillstone offers the same dressed-down menu of a Houston's, but in a nicer setting with truly elite service.  Kaitlyn, our server, was attentive and exactly the right level of chipper. She was pleasing to both my 7-year-old niece as well as my 65-year-old mother. That's no easy feat. The burger was perfect, the beverages were never empty, the table was cleared on time, the check was dropped off and picked up seamlessly and the staff was always around but never a nuisance.   And I love the setting. From the bar to the bathrooms everything just works. There are romantic corner booths and more lively center room talbes and the patio is gorgeous, with a perfect view of bustling Camelback Road.   Whether it's a business meeting or a first date, Hillstone will definitely get my repeat business.",

We were seated right away and the waiter was quick to ask for the drink order. We ordered wine by the glass. I like the service as far as they give, they change out your settings and take away the dishes in an anonymous way. We started with the artichoke, which was a special that night. Really good of course like Bandaras. The sauce was different, but we really enjoyed it.   The Mrs ordered the Hawaiian ribeye with a weird lemon flavored caesar salad. I had the special NY strip steak Medium rare. We got our wine OK and they stopped by a few times to check on us. We got our entrees and everything looked great. The steaks were good size. The Hawaiian Ribeye was thinner than most ribeye cuts and had a Hawaiian sauce. Mehhhh very so so! The Strip came full of taste but a little tough. It came with fries which were awesome! I wish I had some bread or somethin... After the food came, it was like we were on an island. No one came until we were almost done. The Mrs. needed a refill and they took the glass away, but never asked if we would like another round. Bummer... C.mon - I drop over a Cnote and I cannot get another wine! Someone?... It was like they were just tryin to get us outta there. Boooo!  The vibe was awesome! The interior is great! Next time, I want to go sit at the bar with all the cougars and people wandering in from the patio looking for the front desk - that makes for good people watching.   We skipped desert there and went to Culvers for frozen custard!",

Hillstone is the perfect business dinner or date night spot.  The bar is nice and the patio is great.  For the food you can't go wrong with anything but my go to is the French dip or the ribs.",

My husband gets the Dink's Crispy Chicken sandwich and I get the Grilled Chicken Salad.  99% of the time we're very happy with our food.  Once I wasn't completely happy with the salad but didn't say anything until we were through with our meal as it had been okay enough to eat.  They apologized and took it off our bill.  They wanted to make me a new one but we were getting ready to leave so I declined.  We've been eating here since it first opened as Houston's on the south side of Camelback.  We love the new building and the parking is so much better.",

I've ordered the French dip, a huge meaty sandwich in restaurant and been satisfied, take half home. Ordered it for take out and boom, I would have been happier at subway, it's a pathetic sandwich half filled with barely any fries.   My husband ordered the ribs today and loved them so I ordered it to go for my kids today double fry,  no slaw and and my kid came to me and said \"really mom? 7 French fries?\" That's lunch?\"    I looked and sure enough...they split fries to two bags for to go.  And it was a pretty pathetic rack of ribs too.   $80 bucks for 2 and a half meals means I'm aggrevated.    Making sandwiches for my kids after I paid  for a meal because I had a shit day and didn't want to in the first place because I needed 1 hour away ?  I'm done.     0 stars.",

Was it worth $14?    No.      Our steak was nicely prepared and cooked but for $39 I would have like to know if it was grass fed, humanely raises, locally sourced or even aged.   I'm not sure it qualifies as premium beef.     The crispy oysters was creative and the capers where tangy.   My son liked them.     The service was friendly and attentive.     Menu is limited",

I ordered the Nigiri plate and it was decent although the fish was not as thick as it typically is. It did taste fresh though so that was nice.  The reason I give this joint the 4th star is because I ordered a side salad which consisted of kale and cashews, and I definitely didn't have high hopes for this salad. The salad actually blew my mind!!!! It was so delicious and the texture was perfect.   Service was good and the restaurant was clean and had a comforting ambience. I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu...and will order that kale and cashew salad again!",

Have a look:  * French Dip: $24 (really good!  Still not    worth $24) * NY Strip: $54. FIFTY FOUR DOLLARS!  * side dishes: $8. Side dishes at Tavern on     the Green are $9.  * Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail: $21  THESE ARE NOT MISPRINTS. I found the menu on my phone, AND, since you are not being held captive, you, I, can go elsewhere. Donovan's Steak House serves a better steak for less money.   I must be the only one.   I just looked up what I thought is the most ridiculously priced menu I could think of, Tavern on the Green in New York City, and basically, Hillstone was priced the same or more on comparable items.   The burger at Hillstone is $21. \"Ground chuck served all the way...\"  What does that even mean?  \"...served all the way\"???? The 21 Club in mid-town Manhattan, long-serving a very expensive burger, they charge $18 for a burger, add bacon, $2. MORE THAN 21 Club. Sheesh.   (You know what I'm gonna do?  I'm gonna go have a burger Hillstone [for $21!] and then I'm gonna have a burger at Houston's [$15] and I'll bet it's the same damn burger.)  Shrimp cocktail at Hillstone is $21. At 21 in NYC is $21. You go Hillstone. I stay here.   Side orders: $8. Side orders Tavern on the Green: $9.    Well, \"I may be the only one\", but I'm no fool.  You go. You go fill up their parking lot. Outside of Vegas, I don't believe I've seen a $54 steak.  Thank God.  5/18/2015 got a message today that a burger at Hillstone is not $21 but $16. I googled \"Hillstone menu\" and the menu that came up is, in fact, lower  --  all around. The problem is, Hillstone definitely has TWO menus on the Internet and I'm going to post this higher-than-high menu that is not correct. That's a problem!  Based on the new pricing I'll upgrade: 3 stars. That was a very, very good prime rib sandwich!",

For many people in the Valley of the Sun, Houston's at the Biltmore Fashion Park was the standard for moderately priced comfort food with excellent service.  With that said, Hillstone Restaurant has stepped in and has garnered the admiration of the discerning clients from the former Houston's.  We visit Hillstone about once a month. The last time that we visited was because a couple was in from Dallas, they were requesting Lobster Mashed Potatoes or something incredibly delectable like it, which is on the menu at the Hillstone in Dallas.  The evening was unhurried and I believe that we were the last ones to leave the restaurant that night.  We will return again soon.",

Firstly the building and decor look like Tony Starks house in the Iron man movies. Super classy, and cool. Service is phenomenal.   I've tried a bunch of the menu items and they were all amazing. But the real star of the show is the french dip sandwich.   It's perfectly constructed, with finely sliced meat cooked medium rare, so it stays in a tight bundle as it's dipped repeatedly in the au jus without meat falling out. The bread is soft yet holds up against the significant portion of meat, and resists getting too soggy from the au jus. Its served with phenomenal fries that remind me of the shoe string fries of Ruth's chris.   There is a passion for food and customer well-being that comes across in every dish. They are absolutely obsessed with quality food, and it will leave you in awe.   The french dip is without a doubt the most beautiful thing a human can experience between two slices of bread.   I think it's worth going to Arizona just for this sandwich and I plan on doing just that in the future.",

I had a reservation yesterday evening at 7:30 and still waited about 15min. The wait area is small, so you're pretty much standing unless you go outside to sit on the benches. They do have a bar area as well, but it's usually full. They do have a great selection of drinks and I've tried many wines that I love.   For the menu, I've had the steak, rotisserie chicken, Tuna Rolls, and the Dover (a fish they fly in from England on Saturdays only). Last night I had the steak and it was amazing and full of flavor. It's so tender and juicy, you can taste the quality. It comes with broccoli and mashed potatoes which are also great. Whipped to perfection and a great buttery flavor. The service is excellent, if my waiter sent around filling up my water or checking on us, others were passing by and noticed my glass not even half empty and filled it. The amazing food with amazing service truly is why this place is great to enjoy a nice dinner out.",

They only serve this Thursday- Saturday and can go fast, so order it quickly! It was delicious. I kinda wish we had a variety ordered so we could try more of their dishes.  Their key lime pie was amazing!  Really nice mid century feel atmosphere.  We'll be back!",

There website says Gracious service well that's just not True.  Our waitress KAILIE K was just plain useless and rude.  We stopped at this place while visiting in Phoenix and reading about it in travel guide.   At least the service in the bar was good.  Asked about some wines and they were very helpful.   Would have liked to give a better review but really not as impressed as I would have hoped after researching this place and deciding it should be a great night out.    The burger one of us ate was dry and falling apart. The fries were the best though.  Also tried Sushi and this was very good also.   If you plan on coming just eat in bar.",

All the apps are yummy and fulfilling. The wedge salad is the best wedge I've ever had. My go to entree is the filet, they recently added a sauce topping, I prefer mine better without it. It is always cooked to perfection. The kale salad for a side is also delish. And let's not forget about the dessert, the sundae is to die for, it just seems like all the ingredients are quality.   Atmosphere: it's definitely more dressy with a romantic feel. It can get a little loud on weekend nights with the bar and the dining room filled but nothing you can't get past. It is a little pricey but you get what you pay for!!  Service: Always excellent.   I know it sounds like hillstone paid me to write this review but I truly am just a huge fan. I would pick to eat here over and",

My father turned 55 so it's a big birthday, right? My fathers an ex NFL Hall of Famer so no \"high-end\" restaurant is a high-end restaurant. We've seen em all. This was his choice he said why not let's go they're alright. He's a well known regular at Ocean44 & Mastros.  He eats at one of the two places AT LEAST 5 times a week.   He owns a few different business'  One of them being a construction company...this is all pertinent information because he was wearing a wrinkly shirt and we were dressed down/super casual.  We are dark complected Hispanic people and my husband is Indian and is dark complected as well.  I really don't know whether it was our skin color or maybe it was our wrinkly shirts but for a $150 bill (not including the $40 tip HE DIDNT DESERVE) we couldn't even get a damn refill on our teas for 20 minutes. Multiple servers including our own were cleaning up our table trying to clear our table while we were still eating....literally picking up my plate as I'm still eating....ignoring our empty teas, Awkward condescending smiles and let's not forget those oh so J U D G E M E N T A L side eyes.   I've been to the nicest of restaurants in the most beautiful cities and I will NEVER EVER recommend people come here. I had the worst experience and it's seriously 2 days later and I'm still here appalled at how your staff was blatantly JUDGING us  We didn't say anything about Brads high watering pants...or how I watched your server poke her nose then grab a plate to take out.   BUT ANYWAYSSSSS you know who you are  PS. our wrinkly shirts are designer   Oh and the food was eh, I'd say the Vig is better but to compare them to you would be doing them a disservice.",

My mom's boyfriend has excellent taste in fancy restaurants because of the industry he used to work in. While we had family in town over the holidays it was his preference to dine here after a family outing downtown.   His words - \"this is one of a few places in the Valley where you can get fresh Dover sole\". Our reservation was later in the evening so unfortunately they had run out for the day. There's nothing bad here on the menu as a backup choice to sole, even if just soup/salad. We started with spinach dip and our server was kind to bring us more chips. Half of our group ordered The Hawaiian because it truly is an amazing house speciality item. I ordered The Crush drink and it was good, but not my most favorite drink ever. First drink I'd ever had with grapes.   Service was impeccable here for us and it's expected for the price you pay.",

Their response, \"We cannot do that.  The salads are made to order.\"   So again, can they get lite dressing with a side of dressing?  \"No.  They make the salad and toss it in the salad.\"  My guests ask, well with if it is not enough dressing?  \"Well you can send it back and they will make it again?\"   As crazy as this sounds, you cannot make this up.  So the salad comes and needs more dressing.   So what do you do, send the salad back to have or remade with more dressing.   I have never been in a restaurant that does not give you any side of sauce.   Even if you say you will pay for it the clear answer was NO SALAD DRESSING.   Crazy.  As much as I visit Phoenix, this is off the list let alone embarrassing to my guests.",

    "text": "So glad Houston's moved their old location to this impressively designed building.  Apparently it is lifted off the ground just enough so no car lights shine into their glass walls....I could go on and on about the design but take it from a FLW/modern/contemporary enthusiast and with a lil Asian flare, you have Hillstone.  Why they decided to not serve a full menu on the patio probably has to do with the fact that they decided to make it like sand box...literally the ground is set up like a zen garden but for dining, it doesn't work.  Having watched almost a half dozen people trip (we started watching and counting....part of the fun from the evening) it was not fun having the small pebble/kitty litter ground dust up my freshly polished, black shoes.  Service was so bad that we got 3 free drinks and an order of sushi BUT the fact they realized the service wasn't atypical for them so it didn't really bother us...although my trying to stay slimmer a$$ didn't have a Mich Ultra option for a beer.....wah-wah.   Same impressive Cole slaw noted by my guest and their mango, coconut shrimp, Thai, and spicy tuna rolls were ALL fantastic.....also I guess the wasabi is organic so instead of a huge glob that one would assume to accompany their roll, it is asked if desired, and then a small amount is served.....not sure I agree with this attention to detail since I couldn't tell, but that's me.  Overall, it's a Biltmore and Phx-metro must....if they pick up the service and fix those patio issues then they would get a 4.  A place that is too loud to eat in the restaurant and has on the menu \"No Cell Phones In the Restaurant\" would never get 5 from me. The mid to late 40's is the average age which isn their fault but another factor to me that holds a location from perfection.  -jab",

They serve a Caesar salad which is served as a whole leaf. I do not enjoy cutting it up at the table with lettuce sliding off the plate and messing the table area. I requested as I ordered it that it be cut before serving it. They refused saying it doesn't look as good. When I said that i didn't mind if the presentation was compromised and I would enjoy it more cut up. They again said no. They were too busy. Additionally they took some old standbys off the menu. High prices and no regard for customer satisfaction is a bad combination.",

Right off the bat, I gotta say that if you are waiting for your table to be ready and there's no room at the bar... you'll be standing.  There's no seating in the lobby of the restaurant so when your wait it 20+ minutes- prepare to be on your feet if the bar is full, which it was.  The menu is small but that always suggests to me that they have really mastered their menu.  They have lots of wine choices and a full bar.  The wait staff is really on top of their game as far as refills and checking on you.  My husband ordered the Hawaiian rib eye and was very satisfied.  It was a generous portion and a huge loaded baked potato.  I ordered the salmon.  The fish was good but be warned that it's all cooked medium.  I had to send it back to be cooked more.  I don't know if that's a fine dining thing but I've never gotten a fish that wasn't cooked all the way through.  Also, if you're a vegetarian and ordering a salad- make sure you ask no bacon.  I got a side salad and it came loaded with bacon so my husband ended up eating most of it.  They don't have many options for vegetarian dining.  For two dinners, a side salad, an appetizer and one drink (my husband had water) our bill came to $88 w/ tip.  Pricey.",

There were 6 of us at the table & we all ordered the iced tea, expect my mom who always orders a sprite. We all agreed their iced tea was delicious. For our entrees: 3 ordered the Famous French Dip Au Jus, 2 ordered the Fresh Fish Sandwich & I ordered the Club Sandwich. All came with a side of \"shoestring\" cut fries. The French Dip was overall liked except one said his was a bit dry. The Fish Sandwich was the favorite among the entrees. My Club Sandwich was mediocre at best, nothing special. I'm not sure what the others thought (well besides my mom) but I loved the fries. I ate all of mine!  Overall this place is nice but the food is way over-priced. I think I would have enjoyed my meal more if I had ordered a steak or even a burger but I don't think I will be coming back to find out.",

The design and layout of the patio, bar, and main dining area is top notch. The servers that I've gotten have always been very attentive and friendly. I took my grandma there tonight (well to be honest I drove and she paid :) and she's 87 so she kind of rolls at a slower pace and doesn't always hear that well. Our server, Kiersten, was very patient and sweet about everything so it seems like they try to hire great people. I've had the French dip, Hawaiian rib-eye, cheese burger, and prime rib. All great. Tonight I subbed in the kale salad instead of the usual side and I recommend that as well. So, yes, this place should be on your list of restaurants to visit in the Biltmore area.",

    "text": "Mediocre and overpriced.   There's nothing \"New\" about their \"New American\" menu and underwhelmed is the most positive spin I can place on the entire experience.   It's a very limited menu with 15 dollar sandwiches and salads, or 25-30 dollar cuts of meat.  Way to cater to the vegetarians out there with a veggie burger or an overpriced \"entree\" of seasonal vegetables. Do restaurants have any idea how boring it is to eat a veggie burger every time you go out? Get a little creative for christsake, it's not like you're lacking possible ingredient combinations.  I had the ahi tuna burger, which was ground down to a mealy consistency and cooked until bone dry.  It was then garnished with grody, unimaginative toppings like pickles and iceburg lettuce. Top it off with a cloying sweet remoulade that did nothing to moisten the sandwich and you've got a bone dry tonsil scraper. The roasted chicken was on the greasy side but well seasoned. The couscous it came with was a misstep though. Someone threw a ton of whole mint leaves into it that made it inedible instead of \"fresh,\" which I'm sure was the intention. The spinach dip was teensy tiny for the price, and why the heck is it served with canned, crappy salsa and sour cream on the side? Weird.  The fries were the one saving grace. Skin on, super slim shoestring cut with the perfect amount of salt. But I've had fried and battered bulls balls and they've tasted good. Fry anything and it'll improve the edibility.   Service was nearly nonexistant, although as a whole the etiquette was top notch when it was present. But it was a complete disconnect when compared to the cruddy food being slung. You're serving a French dip sandwich, not some wild Top Chef creation. Dial back on the smug.  I don't ever see a need to return to a place that serves traditional (nothing new about it!) American food I can make better in my own home. I expect more from professional chefs than chicken sandwiches and steaks.  Yawn.",

    "text": "Our last couple servers have been warmer and more professional than that earlier clown, but I cant let go of a lingering disdain for this place - even though they're good at what they do. It's just that what they do doesnt really appeal to me anymore.   Part of it is the smaller portion/higher prices slam that others have noted. When Houston's opened in a town without much quality going on, little on the menu was over $10. It was a godsend. Then that excellence was understandably incorporated into the pricing structure, but it was still a decent value for a terrific, consistent kitchen, in a culinary burg getting its legs. But now there's half a dozen places within a bike ride of this joint that serve up larger portions of comparable or near comparable quality, far more reasonably.  Oh, I get that you're paying for ambience, but that's the other thing I'm not wild about.   This is a place that relatively insecure foodies take companions they're trying to impress, by sitting in a nice room and shelling out some dough. Whether it's your boss or client or prom date, you probably wont go too wrong here. The food will be good to excellent,  there will be at least a veneer of fine service. People will say it was lovely at the end of the meal, and in the event that they dont, it wont be your fault.   It's also the sort of place where everyone looks you over. The maitre d, the other customers. Hillstone attracts that sort of moneyed voyeur, compared to dimly lit, almost semi private Houston's. Now there's a see and be seen element in the dining area that used to be confined to the bar.  It's just me. I get this is a formula for success.  See Scottsdale.  But for me, there are more reasonable nearby places providing quality grub and atmosphere, whether it's Postinos, The Parlor, Sierra Bonita or Hana, or even more spartan spaces like Seekong By Night.  They're all good and fun in their own way. Hillstone is just good. There's no fun in it for me. As a stodgy Phoenician, I feel inexorably ripped off and just dont wanna be around many of these people.",

Our last visit we had the focaccia bread appetizer, sushi, the French dip sandwich....all were delicious.  Love the warm atmosphere too.  We have always found the staff wonderful, but our last visit just a few weeks ago was exceptional.  Haleigh was our server and was so excellent.  She spent time with us giving us suggestions with the menu and was very helpful.  We told her we love the French dip sandwich but wished it was in a appetizer portion as we didn't want to have it for our meal....and a few minutes later she brought us that very sandwich on the house.  She was wonderful, professional, sweet and helpful.  We will definitely be back and will request her.",

    "text": "This review is solely based off of the pretentious atmosphere. Hillstone does have some friendly servers and good food but unfortunately the hostess area can be a little entitled. Being in the food industry you should know to be accomdating and if not at least friendly. We had a reservation for 5 and because my family invited me along there was 6. The hostess with a big bun on her head and white pearls said \"No we cannot fit 1 more person. That won't work\" No sense of respect or an \"I'm sorry it doesn't look like we can squeeze a seat in.\" Etc. Having worked at lower price ticket restaurant when I was 19 I know better that in this type of business you want to be customer service friendly and try to be accomdating. My cousins came in late so there was 6 and I'm sorry but I was going to tell my family member who just moved her to turn around drive an hour back home. He sat down with us in the booth. It wasn't too tight and we were not in anybodys way. Yet even a female manager came over introduced herself with no smile. Explained that these booths are meant for 5 and asked if we are comfortable here in a snooty manner. Then we said yes of course we had an unplanned guest and obviously has a reservation we are fine. But if anything larger is available then that would be amazing. She rolled her eyes and said no and that wanted to make sure... lol if that's your management coming to identity that we are in trouble in a manipulative way, I don't think me, my 85 year old grandma and grandpa and mother and father and cousin are blind to your entitled snobbish personalities that run this place. I would say it's good food but no interest in coming to a place with such low class.",

Let's just say I'll be hard pressed to go anywhere but Hillstone from now on.   There was a wait, so we started on the outdoor patio for a drink. The outdoor space is really amazing. Cool lights, unique furniture and overall a great ambiance. I ordered a Maker's Manhattan rocks, and the drink was perfect...So often Manhattans are \"over Vermouthed\", this one was the perfect blend and let the Whiskey speak for itself...Even the ice cubes looked cool.   The restaurant is large, spacious and has a cool design. It's very Frank Lloyd Wright esque. We sat at a booth toward the back of the restaurant, near the kitchen and prep bar. Service was prompt and friendly, as I've come to expect at any Hillstone restaurant.  As for the food, it was delicious. As a table, we ordered the Hawaiian rib eye x2 (ridiculous, mine was a perfect medium rare and delicious), the French Dip and the Prime rib. All meals were well received, even the salads were delicious. The menu is really similar to Houston's (read: nearly identical), so you know what you're getting into.  It's not cheap, but it's absolutely worth it. Hillstone is on my list for a return trip, ASAP.",

The ambiance was great, the little fountains and the patio area was very cool as well.         This is a steakhouse, the better the meal the more it's worth, so you will pay accordingly.  I had a filet and I loved every second of it, not only was is a pretty good size it was done beautifully.  The tortilla soup was even fantastic as well.   Drinks are also high quality. I had an awesome mojito.         I thought the employees were on point, it was a thursday night so I wasn't expecting the A team but they were awesome. Although the place seems kinda snooty the staff was friendly and proficient.               I've been to expensive steakhouses before, not always do I get one that delivers on all fronts.",

All of them worth every penny. The French Dip was pure perfection, served piled high on warm, soft bread which soaked up the horseradish cream and au jus served on the side. And served with some of my favorite fries. Skinny and salty. Much like myself so I've been told.  Critics pan the limited menu. Boo to you. I'm so OVER Cheesecake Factory style menus. They scare me. I will say if they claim to be New American, I don't get that. It's American. Steak house style.   And the decor! I could TOTALLY move in and not change a thing! The sandstone. The masculine wood panels and burgundy booths. And I love the photography, specifically the entire wall of swimming pool photos.   Hillstone. Good move!",

We arrived at about 8 PM, on a Tuesday night, and they were still on a 30 minute wait.  The place was absolutely packed, from the bar to the dining room. We waited it out on the nice patio and enjoyed a cocktail. When our table was ready we each ordered something different. I had the Hillstone burger, a take on a bacon cheeseburger. My colleagues had a veggie burger and the other had Chopped salad. Everyone ate every last morsel. My burger was good, not great. I did like their take on a bacon cheeseburger though. Service was outstanding. Our waitress stopped by the table and did not interrupt conversations. Instead she would politely wait until we were done. This is so rare to find these days. I will definitely come back, would absolutely recommend this place to others too.",

    "text": "So I decide to take my daughter here because she loves Houston's. I know they are owned by the same company but have different menu items. When we walk in I ask if there are any choices for kids and the hostess says yes a kids burger and a grilled cheese. Waitress comes over, not genuinely friendly, more like fake friendly. I ask about the kids burger since that's pretty much the only suitable option. She tells me that there's no difference btwn kids and regular burgers. Both $16. Ok I'll pass and order her a California roll. It was 5pc and very different tasting and still had imitation crab but still cost $13. I've never seen a Cali roll cast more than $8. And that's regular price, not $4 happy hour.  I order the French dip which apparently is prime rib but mine was more fat then meat. Disgusting...had to return it. The only good part of the lunch was our appetizer, spinach dip. It's always a win. The mgr was mediocre and took off the Cali roll but acted like he just graduated with a hotel restaurant management degree and was not sure how to treat a customer. Honestly, he should've comped me and bought us dessert but knocking off an overpriced piece of sushi was better than nothing. Next time I'll go to the Henry. 100% better than this place",

How do you not know what whiskey you have?   So anyways, my friend and I ordered the Chicago Spinach and Artichoke dip and it was really good! I loved it. I would definitely order that again :)  My friend order the Spicy Tuna Roll, I was a bit skeptic at first but yet, it was surprisingly pretty good.

Houston's turned Hillstone has been a great change in atmosphere as well. From a dark ordinary layout to an open architecturally stunning restaurant.   Must haves:  Artichoke App Filet Mignon Any Salad Fish Sandwich Cobbler Kettle One Martini up with Blue Cheese Olives! (Have at least 2)  There is usually a wait of some sort, but they have an awesome patio for those nice Arizona nights.

When we sat down we were greeted right away by someone and she said she'd be right with us. A few minutes later a different person came to the table and said they would be our server and that \"they would be taking care of us\" we placed our drink order with her. A few moments after that we had another server change and a different person came over to deliver the drinks and said that she \"would be our server and would be taking care of us\" so we placed our meal order with her. Then the FOURTH person came to our table and introduced himself and said that \"he would be our server and that he would be taking care of us\" we asked why we had four server changes in the first 10 minutes of sitting down and he said that it had to do with when he was scheduled to come on and that we were seated in his section. Now I actually used to work at Houston's in San Francisco on the Embarcadero, which is owned by the same restaurant group, and I'm pretty familiar with what is considered spec, and four different servers within 10 minutes is not how it's supposed to be done. Nevertheless the server that we did have was AWESOME. I wish I could remember his name, I think it was David? Maybe Brian? He made up for all the server changes, he was kind, attentive, and the rest of our meal everything was seamless. I had half of a my burger left and he even offered to give me a side of fries to take home which was very thoughtful. I had the other half of my burger and the fries later in the day and everything warmed up nicely and was just as delicious as when I was in the restaurant. Our server saved the experience that day at Hillstone for us. Having frequented Hillstone, Houston's and Bandera we always find the food delicious, you won't be disappointed.",

The patty was covered in a sweet soy sauce that overpowered the burger. It was so sweet in fact I sent it back (I hate doing that). The new burger she brought (minus said sauce) was not impressive either. There was a serious consistency issue, it crumbled with every bite. A good veggie burger should stay formed while eating.. Another drawback is that it is 12 bucks, way to pricey for what you get. I'll happily pay 16 for the French Dip, it's well worth it.  Our server was excellent and all the other options I have tried there have been great earning 4 stars. Word to the wise, if you like syrupy veggie patties that fall apart go with the veggie burger, otherwise be a carnivore and destroy the French Dip. Like I wish I would have today.",

I've never had an issue with the service and the waiters are knowledgeable and welcoming, but it can be annoying that they refuse to seat you until your entire party is present- even if it is only a party of two!  You'll find a pretty diverse group of people at Houston's and like others have said, it makes for some interesting people watching.  I usually suggest this place when I'm meeting up with my grandmother for a late lunch, I can't really imagine going here to hang out and meet people.  But, that might be an age thing- I think the group looking to meet and mingle here falls into the box marked well above my 25 years.  As far as the food goes, the veggie burger is AMAZING!  I eat meat, but opt for this instead of a real burger because it is so good.  The patty is nothing like a garden burger or boca burger, it doesn't pretend to be meat.  The coleslaw is also my side of choice with this meal.  The ribs are fabulous as well, some of the best!    Overall, great food and nice atmosphere with a slight touch of snootiness thrown in the mix (I have to say- I never really get the snootiness of some of the patrons in this place, where exactly do they think they are?)",

Even at the bar--folks seem to have settled in for the evening --me included--as I was there for almost three hours.  I have to say the wine starts at $9 a glass so if you plan to spend the evening it is not going to be inexpensive--so no so much because of the food--except for the fact that there was one special that was steak and was $40--which I think is somewhat outrageous for this economy  anyway--to get back to the food--I had the club salad--and it was nice--nothing spectacular--i think why I will go back is more for the ambiance of the restaurant it self--service from the bar was okay--they are busy so don't expect a service level that blows your socks off, but I do think they were giving it their best shot.  in spite of it all --there was a nice vibe sitting at the bar that I liked.",

It is very open and modern with a mid-century vibe to it.  Love it!  The patio looks cozy with outdoor furniture and a few fire pits.  There is a big piano in the bar area.   Awesome veggie burger - one of the best in Phoenix!! They make it in-house and it has a great nutty flavor to it.  They have another vegetarian entree which is some kind of steamed seasonal veggie platter, which seems kind of boring but I would give it a shot.  Not many other veg-friendly items though.   I know this is silly, but I was really amused by the ice cubes in my tea.  They're the perfect, old-school CUBES!    My folks are regulars here so when I went with them we got great, VIP service.",

I had the roast salmon, my son the prime rib.  Both were very well prepared and came out of the kitchen exactly the way they were ordered. Focaccia was an appetizer and was eaten with a glass of Merlot.  With a shared dessert, one coffee and a Coke, the bill came to a little over $120 with a generous tip for the impressive service. This is an imposing amount for a retiree but, probably, the going rate for s restaurant of this caliber.   I was impressed how well management handled the crowd, the kitchen and the service staff.",

This is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houston's.   We deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son. He started to fuss on and off during dinner. Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself.   We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children.  To ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting. We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family.",

    "text": "My boyfriend took me to Hillstone on Saturday night for dinner to celebrate our 3 year anniversary.   1-The interior is stunning. A gorgeous patio with big open windows, a wrap around bar that is decorated with expensive wines, whiskeys, etc... and fresh fruit, the lighting is dim (for us romantic folks), and the overall architecture is modern.  2-Hillstone has exceptional service. From the second we walked in the door we experienced nothing but real people trying to help us enjoy a relaxing evening with dangerously delicious food and beverage. If you are a wine snob, this place is for you. I LOVE myself a killer glass of wine but seeing as how my boyfriend already spoiled us with two new bottles, (which we've yet to enjoy together) we decided to go with cocktails. Our bartender was fabulous and friendly BUT he didn't know what a Moscow Mule was when I ordered it and my boyfriends Manhattan tasted more like watered down whiskey with muddled orange. With no hopes for a Moscow Mule I decided to order their Margarita on the rocks since I could see at least 4 other people at the bar with one. Can't go wrong right? It was ok. A little too much sweet and sour for my pallet. I was a little annoyed when I asked for a drink suggestion from the bartender he automatically started with \"We have Cosmopolitans, Lemon drops....\" as soon as he said \"Lemon Drop\" I felt my face go blank and in my head I said \"really man? I know I'm a girl but really?\" I almost stopped him dead in his tracks to order a glass of whiskey. Straight up. He was just being a great and informative bartender so I of course understood. Just thought that was fairly entertaining. I'm sure they have both those drinks ordered a lot!   3- The food is stupid amounts of tasty and the portions are more than anyone would really ever need. Which is good right? Leftovers! We ordered the Cheese Bread, Grilled Artichoke, and The Vegetarian Burger to share. So basically we ordered pizza, one vegetable, and a hamburger and fries. I felt so heavy after ha! But boy or boy, my taste buds were singing and dancing their little hearts out.   You get 3 large pieces of half an artichoke, which was more than enough for us. We ended up taking one of the artichoke pieces home. you get 6 fairly large sized pieces of soft, warm ciabata bread covered in two cheeses with olive oil and herbs... and the Vegetarian Burger is on a classic hamburger bun with tomatos, shredded lettuce, pickles, and the burger itself has some sort of orange chutney or glaze(?) on it. SO GOOD. This veggie burger is pretty well known and popular from what I hear! Even steak lovers have got to try it.  This place has a higher price point and for good reason. Great atmosphere, amazing service, and food that makes your heart happy. You'll be happy to pay for the experience.",

Our waiter was friendly and came over right away to offer us drinks.   The menu is rather pricey so I decided to order a chicken waldorf salad and my co-worker ordered a chicken caesar salad.  When we received our salads the first thing we noticed was that the chicken was pink in both of the salads and it appeared that it had not been cooked enough.  The chicken caesar salad is supposed to come with croutons and it did not.  The chicken waldorf salad was ok but the pinkness in the chicken did bother me.  My co-worker and I should have sent the salads back.    After we got back to the office, we both commented that our stomachs were a little queasy.  I will definitely not be back to the restaurant.  It is way over priced and I believe that if you are going to pay more for your food it should be amazing.  I can make a better salad at home.  Overall I was disappointed with my first dining experience at Hillstone.",

The service, while better this occasion was still a bit off.  Two examples:  1) Length of time for wait staff to revisit our table for refreshments was fairly lengthy in comparison to the old Houston's.  2) When asked about the sauce used in the Thai Tuna Roll, the waitress looked very blank and then said it was in the roll. She replied, tuna and some sort of Thai sauce.  Noooo kidding.  I will give this place another chance and another star because I really like their food.  I will more than likely return.  However, I will update with new reviews until it's back to the place I remember.",

What a disappointment!   The service was just awful, very cold and impersonal; one person in our group said \"hoity toity,\" and the food was more expensive and not as quality compared to Houston's menu. Everything about Hillstone is the opposite of Houston's. Where the seating and atmosphere at Houston's was warm and inviting, at Hillstone it is cold and impersonal.   Yes, obviously much money was spent on Hillstone but in our opinion, to its disadvantage because of its slight ostentatious presentation. It is pretty but something about it felt off.  We tried Hillstone two times in case the first time was a fluke but our experience was the same as the first. Bummer for them because at our favorite restaurants we always tip 30-45% of our bill.  In their defense two things: 1) Our experience was from the first year it opened which I noticed there are so many similar reviews to mine from that time, so maybe they made some adjustments and,  2) Maybe they are not trying to be like Houston's which is fine for them but not for us. We miss Houston's and wanted a version of it. Hillstone is not it. So we will keep searching.",

We were a little sad when they told us they were closing, but excited that they were building a brand new building just down the road.   Last night the Hubs, mother in law and I decided to hit up Houston's. We pulled up to the valet and no one was there, we look and Houston's is gone. Then we looked and noticed the Hillstone sign was lit.   The hubs and MIL didn't believe me that Hillstone and Houston's were the same company. But they are! Woot!   The new building is AMAZING! I loved the patio, though they will only serve apps and drinks out there, they wont let you have dinner out there which is to bad considering last night was perfect out door dinning weather.   The new building has that same Houston's vibe, only its way bigger! It now features two bars AND a sushi bar!   The food is still the same and still just as amazing as it always is!   One note of complaint however. The old Houston's used to offer a Riesling by the glass, now its only by the bottle, which is a total bummer because that's all my MIL will drink.   We really had a great experience as we always do with this company.",

I came with girlfriends for a casual lunch to catch up and we definitely enjoyed ourselves.  We have a bottle of wine and the spinach dip o start.  The wine was amazing (but for some reason not at the right temperature, wasn't cold enough) and the spinach dip was pretty good.    I also had the soup and salad (clam chowder and house salad) which were both fantastic.  My only complaint is that I wanted more of that soup!  With Phoenix being so far from water, good seafood isn't easy to find and this clam chowder tasted like it was fresh and full.   We were too stuffed for dessert but the options definitely looked yummy!  Oh, one last MAJOR gripe - PARKING!  In Phoenix parking is rarely a concerned.  Well at Hillstone at noon on Friday, I had to circle around the parking lot for 15 minutes before I found a spot.",

The first time I went to Houston's was with a girlfriend of mine who told me that I had to try the French Dip. It was perfect. Housemade bread, thin slices of the moistest beef. The shoestring fries on the side were ah-mazing as well. We splurged and dipped them in the Housemade Buttermilk Garlic dressing. If you're going to enjoy good food, do it up right.  The next time I went was a few weeks later with my boyfriend. The servers are always hopping and your glass isn't left empty. Those servers can move. It's almost a show to watch. Anyways cutting to the chase. My boyfriend ordered the French Dip and I ordered their Cheeseburger. So moist, so delicious. I can say it's one of the best burgers I've ever had. I had to tap on the table a few times to get my boyfriends attention as his head was in his plate nearly the entire time. \"Hello dude! I'm here too!\"  Two thumbs up to Houston's.",

The lunch menu is similar to the old Houston's menu, though it appeared to have some minor changes.  Our service today, unlike what some have reported here, was fine.  In fact, if anything multiple members of the staff seemed to go overboard and checking up on us and finding if any issues existed at very regular intervals.  As we stopped by for lunch on Sunday, I just grabbed the hickory burger and cole slaw, while my wife had the salmon with roasted beets.  The food was up to the standards of the old Houston's.  My wife also tried out the sushi (she goes for that sort of thing--I generally don't) and she was relatively impressed.  The new building is similar in layout and design to the old location, but much brighter than the former Esplanade location, now sporting outside seating in the bar area.  There's even a bit of a skylight on the west end of the facility.  Right now it helps show off the local weather, though we'll have to see how well the new design handles Phoenix summers.  For those who haven't been around in a while, the building is a new one, located on the site where the old Chevy's on Camelback used to be--just to the east of the Chase Bank on the north side of Camelback.",

I had the ahi tuna plate, it was AMAZING. I'm craving it again now.   Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal. It's a little on the spendy side but I will be back for a celebration!",

The menu features a wide array of options from sushi to salads and from steak to burgers. My burger was very good, but be expected to pay more than you would. It's a little pricey for my taste, but I can't deny that they serve wonderful food here. Make sure you dress to impress and if need be, there is also a valet at the restaurant.   The staff is friendly and service excellent, adding to the overall experience. Definitely recommended.",

SOOOO good. I don't think I can come here without getting it. However, if you are looking for a lighter option, the pressed sushi is probably the second best thing on the menu. It is 4 large pieces and comes with a salad, if you aren't too hungry it is probably enough for dinner!   They also have a really nice outdoor patio area to eat on. If the weather is nice, I highly recommend it!",

Foccocia and smoked salmon appetizers can make my meal any day, especially nice when it's  hot outside.  Grilled artichoke is also available when in season. The Thai  steak and noodle salad is fantastic, perfect combination of sweet (mango) and savory.  The French dip is wonderful and perfectly sharable, especially after indulging in too many appetizer selections.   Desserts are always good!  I rarely  have room.

Had reservations for this evening. When the food arrived my food was cold and order was incorrect. I informed our server and it took about 10-15 minutes to get the side I was missing.   We decided to order a dessert to go. We waited an additional 20 minutes to receive our dessert. After waiting for so long I had to get up and speak to a manager. Our dessert was removed from the bill, but it would have been nice to be informed that the kitchen was running behind rather than just sitting there with no communication from our server.   My husband and I left pretty disappointed. Please improve! We really loved this place.",

    "text": "Today, we stopped into Hillstone (one of our favorite restaurants) to purchase a couple gift cards for Christmas presents.  We decided to stay and have lunch since we were here.  This was my first time I was extremely disappointed.  Our service was the worst I've ever experienced.  We come here quite often, so I know what to expect of the food, service, etc.  This time our served was less than mediocre. We didn't have prompt refills on drinks or anyone to check in on us.  The server was confused who ordered the sushi and tried giving it to her coworker who was on a break.  We always get the French dip.  This time it didn't come with the creamy horseradish it typically comes with, nor did the server ever come by again for me to ask for it.  By the time I received it, my French dip was no longer hot.   I thought the whole thing was very weird since I have NEVER experienced this before.  The entire icing on the cake was when we paid and I didn't receive my card back in a reasonable time frame. We sat there with no drinks and all our empty plates stacked in front of us for a substantial amount of time.   If I was at a place like Applebee's, I can look past this type of service, but after spending a total of $280 and having crap service is unacceptable in my book.  All I can hope for is the recipients of these gift cards won't experience this type of service because that would be embarrassing.",

    "text": "In town to see my mom and made a special plan to have dinner here with one of our family members who comes here often.   We have always had stellar experiences at this restaurant from the service to the food. Sadly, our experience tonight was seriously uncomfortable and was going to go further downhill had it not been for the lovely management.   Beware of the lack of descriptors on the menu. Lovely French Dip sandwich ($22) is slathered in mayo(not on the menu and who the heck puts mayo on a French Dip)? Key Lime pie with graham cracker crust is actually a graham cracker/pecan crust (pecan part NOT listed on menu)- and more.  Hours later and I'm still irked about the way our original waitress handled more than one request from the table (she never gave her name but that was the least of her transgressions) and sadly, even the going above and beyond to ensure we will come back, I can still only give our latest jaunt here 3 stars( it would have been 1).  Disclaimers/Suggestions: (1) Mayo is my kryptonite. Bring me food with it on it or near it when I wasn't given the option to leave it off is seriously like Superman being thrown off his game. (2) I've worked in the food service industry and currently have a daughter in college who works as a server. I know how have this business is and am keenly aware of how hard it is to keep places afloat.  (3) I'm loyal to places and tip well- especially in states that don't pay servers the federally mandated minimum wage due to tipping. It hurts my soul when a server gives attitude when my mom asks for extra lemon for her iced tea or has to flag someone down for soy sauce for the sushi she ordered or if the very loud music can be turned down. For those who care, it can be and was but only after my conversation with management after our server told us it could not be with an astounding \"NO\". (4) Make some new menus: If your FD has more on it than sliced prime rib on a roll and au jus- put it on the menu. Same thing goes with nuts in a crust. The \"read before you go\" is no way to ensure the waitstaff will ask if there are nut allergies at the table, and some of us have aversions and not actual allergies. Be awesome and just have a menu that says what is in/on your food. Wonder which is more cost effective- making new menus or having food sent back to the kitchen and then comping a meal even after a re-fire.  Again, this would have been a 1 star review (my experience and again, reviews are subjective), had I not been pro-active and asked to speak to a manager, explained the main issues and in turn management having the autonomy and going above and beyond.   Maybe I'll see you again Hillstone- but not a second time this trip like we would have planned.",

She managed getting our food out at the same time and other food out faster for the little ones. They have a policy that a chair needs to be under the seat that attaches to the table for kids. No one there has a child because if they did they would get rid of the stupid rule. This makes sense for an infant but for a toddler standing on the chair underneath is extremely dangerous because then the child can fall out! Come on people!",

It comes from the developers behind Houstons and Banderas and is an upscale option for salads, sandwiches, steaks, fish and ribs.  Upscale but it won't break your bank...without wine a typical meal is around $75 inc tip.   The food here is top notch. When artichokes are in season, they are on the MUST ORDER list--wood fired and juicy with an amazing remoulade dipping sauce. Another great option for an appetizer is the coconut shrimp sushi roll. Unusual and mouthwatering!  For entrees I I highly recommend the French Dip which is the best I've tried anywhere, the salmon (it comes medium rare so make sure to specify if you like it cooked more), and the ribs which are fall-off-the-bone wonderfulness!!!!   You must get dessert at least once--you may think I'm crazy for suggesting something as simple as the hot fudge sundae. But you will leave with a newfound respect for the simple sundae after trying a sundae at Hillstone.  All in all, there is no finer dining choice than Hillstone.",

It's a homemade, black bean-based patty.  It's moist (although I hate that word.  But it is.) and a perfect texture -- it doesn't feel meaty in your mouth, but it's substantial.  It's just right.  I wasn't a fan of the fries, but I didn't need to get to those because the burger was so big.  I also liked that the server enthusiastically supported my choice of a veggie burger (at a ribs and burger place) rather than poo pooing it.  I realize that is server-specific, but props to my server for singing the praises of the Houston's veggie burger when I ordered it.  Not having to defend my dinner selection makes a difference in my overall enjoyment of my meal.  Thanks to the yelpers who suggested this!

And check out the Hawaiian Ribeye steak - fabulous.  And don't forget the strawberry shortbread - still thinking about it.  Staff is friendly, and know their food and wines - not stuffy, just right.  Do yourself a favor and dine there NOW.",

    "text": "Was looking forward to eating here as I don't get down to the Biltmore area all that often and have always wanted to try Hillstone.   Stopped in for lunch last week and was very disappointed.    First off it is hard to find the hostess desk.   When you walk in from the parking lot you walk right into the bar.   They have to have a sign guide you to the hostess stand and even then it's hard to navigate your way.  We got there about 2:00 pm so didn't have to wait.  We were greeted promptly by a pleasant young woman who took our drink orders.  A young man delivered our drinks.   Then we had to wait forever for someone to take our order.   Finally a waiter stopped by but he literally just stood there.    We told him it was our first time in and he didn't ask if we had any questions about the menu or try to sell us an appetizer.   He literally just \"stood there.\"   The items we ordered included smoked salmon appetizer, spinach artichoke dip, prime rib, classic California roll, bread, margaritas, apple walnut cobbler.   The food was not that good.   I ordered the prime rib medium well and they had to sear it to bring the temperature up.   I know prime rib is a fatty cut of meat but this was almost all fat.   It was just awful!!  We asked for bread but did not realize until we got the bill there is a separate charge for bread.   Of course our \"wonderful\" waiter failed to inform us of this.   The spinach artichoke dip was extremely greasy.   The best thing we ordered were the margaritas.   They were excellent.  I believe in giving a place at least three chances but this place does not deserve it.    Try the Capital Grille right down the road.   I've never had a bad experience there.",

I have never been disappointed... but I always leave there thinking why did we spend so much money on two burgers and a few drinks.   I have been other places where I get equally good food with equally good service at half the price.   Maybe the reason for the high priced food is for the numerous servers that come to your table throughout your dinner... one to take your drink/appetizer order... one to bring your drinks... someone to take your dinner order... another to bring it... different one to check on you.  seems excessive and i never know who my waiter/waitress is:).

    "text": "I was excited to try this place after learning it used to be Houston's and I used to LOVE Houston's back when I lived in Rockville, MD.  I was extremely disappointed that the hostess and establishment could not seat us outside unless we would only want to order appetizers.  The appetizers menu consisted mostly of sushi and three other items.  I am pregnant so this in no way would work for me!  I thought it was very discriminating of them to not make an exception for me and let me order a salad outside.  The rest of my party would have been happy with just sushi, but I am not about to take chances with sushi and pregnancy.  I am very obviously 7 months pregnant and it is hard enough being pregnant and they just made it worse that night.  We ended up waiting 15 minutes for a table inside and of course I was crying and our poor server was probably thinking WTF.  He was a very nice guy and a very good server and he did make up for a little bit of how I felt I was discriminated against.  I ordered the Thai noodle salad and it was good.  The mango was super ripe and the avocado was also nice.  My husband and his brother both ordered some crispy oysters that were served on a bed of creamed spinach and they loved their meals.  My sister-in-law got the ribs which they are known for.  Her cole slaw was good.  Also we had started with the spinach dip and chips and they were pretty much your run-of-the mill item.  Nothing spectacular.  Not bad but not anything you probably can't get at TGIFridays.  The dessert offerings were only strawberry shortcake, key lime pie or an ice cream sundae so we skipped dessert.  Honestly I am not into fruity desserts or ice cream but probably for the best we skipped it!  If I hadn't been discriminated against I would have given four stars to this place.  It just isn't right to treat pregnant women that way.",

The place looks high end - stone, wood, water, fire elements all represented in one way or another.  The service is excellent.  The waiters/waitresses know the menu extremely well and are very helpful/attentive.  My in-laws ordered the smoked salmon for an appetizer.  It comes with toast points and a fresh sauce that complements the fish extremely well.  I ordered the steak thai salad and everyone else ordered the center cut filet.  I can't speak for everyone else.  However, my steak thai salad was an extremely generous portion.  The steak was buried inside the rest of the salad like a surprise.  It was cooked to what I would say was medium and was very tender and juicy.  Definitely the best steak that I have ever had.  The salad had a bit of spice kick to it - be aware of that if you order it.  There were slices of avocado, mango, and tomato in it as well - a nice blend of creamy, citrus, and sweetness.  The prices aren't too ridiculous for the type of place that it is.  My salad was $17 and the center cut filets were $33 from what I can remember.  I would highly suggest trying this place out if you are up for some delicious steak!",

It's not a crime to like a place with more than one location, even though some chains suck. This one is unbelievable.  Everything is perfect! The service seems choreographed. Somehow you have a handful of people waiting on you, yet everything arrives on time and in front of the right person (why can't other restaurants keep track of who ordered what?).  The food is unbelievable. The menu is small because they only serve what they can do best. The ribs are to die for -- they just fall off the bone. Knife and fork only. The veggie burger is unbelievably good (bran base). The salads are huge but delicious (even though they sadly changed the name of the Evil Jungle Noodle Thai Steak Salad). The lemonade is sweet and pulpy, and the spinach dip puts all other dips to shame.  Houston's is my reference point: if a restaurant is more expensive, it had better be better than Houston's. Few meet that criterion.  p.s. get the warm brownie.",

There's generally a wait, but because they have a great bar and outdoor space - my bf and I have never minded the wait. It's usually about 45 mins or so on a busy night but no wait when going for lunch. I've been to many other steakhouses throughout the valley and have YET to find a better filet than Hillstone's. Came here for New Years and because our reservation was delayed over an hour, they comped our meal. This was such a nice gesture and especially great because our out of town guests that had joined us were blown away and plan to come back. Highly recommend!",

Obviously, when a beloved restaurant for the food and service is closed or changed it is like losing a boyfriend of girlfriend!  Life will never be the same.  A few months ago, I brought my sister in for lunch and we ordered the special,  Loup de Mer with Marcona almonds (it is now listed on the menu) and the sauteed Swiss chard.  Wow!  It was fabulous. The fish was moist and flavorful and the skin crisped!  As always, the vegetable sides are creative and flavorful.  My 5 year old niece ignored her gigantic adult size burger and dug into her mother's fish.  Obviously her mother was ecstatic!    My husband and I are now finding that Hillstone is our go to restaurant for hamburgers, French prime dip, and the fish again.  My husband had the chicken salad this past weekend and loved it.  Also, the kale salad with a hint of mint is very addictive.  The service, especially at the bar, has risen to Houston's quality service both friendly and helpful.",

So we decided to be the early birds and arrived at 5:15pm, and wow, this place is quite full, and it's a very mixed crowd at 5pm, you can see family with young children, couples, and friends or colleagues, this has to be good, right?  The restaurant itself is very big, plus a big patio/outdoor seating. Interior lighting is to the dark side in my opinion, but at least the tables are not so close to each other, the seating arrangements were nicely done that you would feel spacious.  After a few minutes of discussion, three of us decided to share the Smoked Salmon appetizer, two had the Hawaiian Ribeye and I took the waiter's recommendation,  Loup de Mar it is! So here is a bit recap:  Thai Tuna Sushi Roll - No, we did not order this, yet it somehow showed up on our table when the waiter decided to say it's on the house (but we all know they must have made a mistake on orders), but hey, it's free, we can at least have a try! Interesting enough, this sushi roll had a thinly and a little shinny rice paper wrapped outside of the rice, I assume it can keep the roll stay in shape, and it's a little chewy. This roll was to our surprise, pretty good! It has a taste of coconut, macadamia nuts, jalapeno and avocado. The sweetness and spiciness went well together!  Hawaiian Ribeye - Both medium rare steak came to the table with some 'serious burns', it was later I found out that's caused by the sweet glaze outside of the steak. The steak was cooked well, but a bit too sweet for me, and the baked potato was very big!  Loup de Mar - Grilled Seabass with Butternut Squash over some mariana/tomato sauce, very good combination! However, I personally dislike the presentation of this dish. First, I had expected to see a filet of seabass, instead, i got this center-opened, tilapia looking fish with skin and TAIL, was it all necessary? And the randomness of so many crushed pieces of almonds all over the fish, I guess i shouldn't have too much expectation. But really, I thought you would only see fish tails in Chinese food, lol. The fish was cooked a bit oily, to my guess, because it had the skin on, you just need some extra oil to prevent it sticking on the pan.  I was very glad on choosing the butternut squash, with the sourness from mariana/ tomato sauce, it complimented well with the a bit oily fish.   Smoked salmon appetizer - We all really liked this! The fish was so soft that it just melted to your mouse like a salmon-flavored butter. Really wish we could have this before the entree!  BUT, our seem-to-be-in-a-rush waiter literally grabbed the plate with 1/3 of fish left, without asking, and took off... excuse me? If we didn't receive the dish until later, at least give us a bit more time to eat!  So this is the order of how we have received our food, the appetizer we actually ordered came 5 mins after the entrees were served.  Service overall was attentive, however, the waiter or kitchen staff first messed up our appetizer order with another table, although we took a freebie, our actual appetizer didn't come till we already started eating the main dishes. Then the waiter took the unfinished dish without asking, and some other helper came to grab my plate, then asked if i was done, it was only 6:30 by the time we were done, why are you guys in such a hurry? I know you want to clean out the finished plates, but next time, please ask before you have your hand on the plate!  With both of the appetizers being very nice, a just a-ok for entrees, and somewhat 'interesting' serving staff, I couldn't pass to give a 3-star rating.",

    "text": "Okay, I love Houston's even though it's a chain. I travel about 90% of the time with my job and Houston's consistently has good food, clean restaurants and great service (I don't understand why all restaurants don't follow their service mantra...where every server takes care of every table...you never have a dirty dish sitting on your table or want for anything for more than 5 minutes.) It is safe to say I'm probably Houston's number one fan! (Just ask my friends who know Houston's is going to be my first suggestion as the place to go eat.) I frequent the 24th St & Camelback location in Phoenix the most. \"T\" the hostess is absolutely terrific. I ALWAYS feel special when I go in there. All of the food is good. I love the smoked salmon or spinach dip as an appetizer. And the Ahi Tuna salad, the French Dip and the  chopped chicken salad are incredible. I try and make it in to the restaurant on Thursdays for their Chicken Enchilada soup which rocks! Finally, their Sundae is the best I've ever had. Unfortunately, it's difficult to make a choice between that and their key lime pie. I have a few complaints about Houstons, I don't like their tea or lemonade very much. Lemonade is too sour and the tea tastes artificial. I'm also bummed they don't have a blender in their bar for frozen margaritas. Perhaps it's because of the noise, not sure? The ambiance at the place is always relaxing. Portions seem to be getting smaller and prices have gone up (like everything else) so bring your wallet.",

    "text": "Houston's is a great upscale rib chain. The location at the Camelback Esplenade is a really nice location (although I've never been to any other location so I can't make comparisons). The place has a great atmosphere; the dim lighting really works. There are often long waits during peak times, but there's a tunnel to Biltmore Fashion Park across the street, so you can kill a little time if you have a really long wait. The service can be a little slow, as it was on my last visit back in December, but the servers are good. I have to say, I've never had the ribs before, but I've heard that they are outstanding. Next time I'm in Phoenix, I'll have to try them. My favorite thing here is the Hickory Burger. It is excellent. It's a burger topped with Canadian bacon, cheddar cheese, and smothered with barbecue sauce. Shoestring fries accompany the burger. The burger just tastes really good. The combination of the barbecue sauce and cheese on the underlying patty works really well. The meat tastes great too, which helps. The bacon also adds to it. The fries are really good here; you have a selection of sides, but the fries are definitely the best choice. They're really thin, but they're full of flavor. I had the Apple Walnut Cobbler for dessert. It's huge! Everything about it was outstanding. The apples with the walnuts, the ice cream, it was all good. Overall, if you're looking for a really good, upscale American place in the Valley, head to Houston's either on Camelback or Scottsdale. It's worth it. Now if only they'd open up a location in NE Ohio (there are a lot of great chains with Valley locations that aren't in Cleveland).",

My father got the ribs, man were they good, they were just absolutely tender and my mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. My mother got the French Dip, i didn't try hers but she said it was wonderful. The service at Houston's was fantastic, our waiter seemed to anticipate every need we needed, which I like.

These things make spending a decent chunk of money completely OK for me. I have always have above average food here whether it be the butterfleid fillet, the veggie platter, the burger, or the best veggie burger I have ever sunk my teeth into ( yes you veggie's out there, the best). I usually go with the fish special. They cook over cedar planks and other flavor enhancing woods that really add something that you might not taste at home, and that is what I love about this place; I can leave not thinking I could have made that for half the price and it would have been ten times better at home. The drinks are good but, yes, overpriced. The desserts are awesome the chocolate sauce over the brownie is homemade, and the apple thing is superb as well. I must say the most impressive thing to me about any Houston's, SF, LA, SEA, PHX, the service is some of the best I have had in this particular price range.",

Every bite just kept me wanting more and more, the sweet glaze they put on the steak tastes soooo good. I wasnt expecting to enjoy it as much as i did, in fact i can't wait to go back and order it again. Its no Ruth Chris or Mastro's quality but still very good for the price.",

The Kale and cashew salad is also a great simple salad if you're looking for a light healthy start. It has a pleasant sesame oil flavor. If you like fish like I do, you will love their pan fried salmon. They cook it medium, the fillet is a good size. You can always change the seasonal side that comes with it.

I ordered the Hawaiian ribeye, with a loaded baked potato. The steak was very good, cooked a perfect medium rare, with a not-overwhelmingly sweet glaze. The potato was pretty decent as well. For dessert, I asked to be surprised with whatever they recommended, and was served a tasty ice cream sundae.  It was very good, on my short list for places to go for a nice night out.",

I didn't give her a chance to speak and told her we'd be in the bar waiting... Not even 20 minutes later and a gracious new hostess sat us in the dining room. Food was excellent along with the service, it was unfortunate the nasty hostess dampened the visit to Hillstone, Phoenix, AZ.",

    "text": "UPDATED 8/2017: My original review was three stars because of what I describe below. I have been there twice since and the service is better. They've definitely improved. Still kind of crazy with so many different people helping you but they have coordinated it a bit better.  -----------------------------------------------------  This review is for lunch on a Sunday. The food is good but the service is not. We've been here twice for lunch, once for dinner. The dinner service was good. The lunch service is quite poor. Keep in mind that the restaurant was not busy at all.  We were served by many different people. One of them identified himself as our waiter. Our waiter asked if we needed anything and we said we needed a couple minutes to check out the menu.  About 10 minutes later, he finally came back and took our order. After a reasonable amount of time (maybe 10 minutes), we got our food - delivered by two different people. Based on my previous experience, I knew I better ask for anything I needed right then. I asked for ketchup and the nice woman who handed me my plate said \"sure.\" She never came back.  After waiting about 5 minutes for someone to come by I finally flagged down someone walking by. I asked for the ketchup. It started to seem like he wasn't going to come back either but then he showed up with the ketchup.  My drink ran out and I was almost done with my meal before the waiter... who we hadn't seen since he took our order... came by and I asked for another drink. My partner's ice tea went empty and was not refilled until I flagged someone else down to fill it.  Ironically, the check came promptly, was processed promptly and the receipt was quickly picked up. If the service during the meal was as good as it was on the check, I would have been much more satisfied.  We're going to give it another try for dinner and see if it is truly just the lunch service that is lacking.   Given the price and the number of staff they have (we were served by at least six people), there's no excuse for bad service.",

In addition our party ordered chicken, a pork chop which was approximately 21/2 inches thick, bone in and the Hawaiian rib eye.  All were extremely satisfied with their meals. Even though we were happy with our meals the visit was made so much more enjoyable because of our server Christina. She made recommendations, tended to us often, very personable, fun.  Christina took the time to answer questions regarding the restaurant, ingredients, wines.  Never made to feel rushed or intruding on her time.  The next reservation we will definitely ask if Christina is on staff and request her as our server.",

    "text": "I'd been anxious to try this restaurant for quite some time. I was a big fan of Houston's, and when I realized they were all part of the same chain, after Houston's closed down, I looked forward to having a similar experience.   My family and I went on a Sunday evening, and I must say I was disappointed. When we walked in, we were briefly greeted and then the staff member disappeared. The hostess seemed to still prepping for dinner service and looked over her shoulder while gathering supplies, but did not offer a \"I'll be right with you\" or even a welcoming look acknowledging our presence.   When she did address us, it was a short wait time before she located someone to seat us. Once we were seated, we were given our menus and before we could touch them we were asked for our drink orders. No greeting, no \"have you been here before\"... We had to ask what was available to drink. We ordered soft drinks and lemonade.   While we waited for our drinks we searched for a modified children's menus and there wasn't one. When our server returned we inquired and were advised that they grilled cheese and they could modify a chicken dish for children. They referred to it as a big chicken strip. It was not. In addition apparently soft drinks are served in single serving bottles, which was also not mentioned on the menu.  The menus was highly condensed version of Houston's menu with the prime rib and Hawaiian style rib eye one of the only two remaining items reminiscent of Houston's. The \"big chicken strip\" was a flop for my children. It was overly seasoned even for me as an adult. I ordered sides of broccoli to accompany our meals and the broccoli appeared to be steamed with Parmesan cheese sprinkled on it. The menus didn't describe the preparation and one of us at the table had a cheese allergy. In addition it had some add lemon-like tartness to it that rendered it inedible and even though they picked up two orders untouched while clearing the table no one asked how the food was or whether there was s problem.  I ordered the prime rib and it was delicious. My spouse's sea bass was standard. The sushi appetizer, also standard. The worst part in my opinion was the service. The person who seated us, was not our server. He was nice and good natured, but the actual server was iced cold to us, minimally involved, and didn't engage with us at all.  There was a family next to us that she engaged with a lot which lead me to wonder why we got the cold shoulder. She snatched the dishes off the table so fast that my children who's only edible option was french fries stopped eating and gave her their plates.   I literally felt like my $150+ bill was a waste of time and money and my spouse and children advised that they never wanted to come there again.  (1) It's not kid friendly. Couples may Fair better, but you can have a far better experience at Mastro's or Steak 44 especially if you're looking for steak. (2) Unfriendly wait Staff. Although I tipped my standard 20%, it was the first time I ever consider not tipping because the service was lackluster. (3) Check the menu, if you aren't a fan of something they specialize in specifically, go somewhere where they have more options.",

This American Bistro offers salads, appetizers, sandwiches, burgers and both hearty and light entrees. All ingredients are high quality, offerings excellently prepared and served by a well trained, warm, friendly staff.   Hillstone's, and its sister Restaurant Houston's, have created a unique market niche for a high quality, up-market, dining experience in a warm, friendly casual atmosphere. Live piano music in the bar nightly begins the unique experience. There is also a wonderful outdoor patio and outdoor fireplace to have a beverage before dinner. The only downside is there is usually a 20 minute or more wait unless you go mid afternoon.    Tip: Arrive at least 20 minutes before you ideally would like to dine and place your name on the wait list. You can pass the time on the patio by the fireplace or listening to the piano music. If you are fitness conscious walk the neighborhood and look at the shops in Preston Center. Enjoy!!!!",

    "text": "Now remember that I will always review based on the type of place I am at.  Cuisine = 5 stars!!   I had Spinach dip and a delicious burger.  My companions had very delicious meals as well, even the person who received the wrong meal.  Now I will admit that In the dark restaurant, and her being starving due to the late dinner, my young guest did eat her entire meal before realizing it was the incorrect item. She also stated that it was delicious. It was, however the wrong food and there were multiple incorrect delivered items during the course of the meal.  Service = 3 stars.   Our server, although nice, was not very attentive.  When we asked her for specific items such as refills or warm towels because 2 of our people had ribs, we were greeted with a smile and a yes but a look that made us feel that this was a foreign concept.  Experience = 2 stars Now let me explain this.  It was not a terrible experience.  However, when at a place such as Hillstone and paying the prices that go with them, I expect better.  We were delivered $30 in drinks we didn't order and sent them back.  At the end of the meal, we were charged with them and had to make the correction. I feel this should have been resolved far prior to me seeing the bill, especially knowing they had been entered incorrectly.  We told our server about the situation, and a good server should review their bill before delivering it to the table. #2 was the incorrect meal.  One of the main issues was the meal brought was 130% of the cost of the meal ordered.  I give my table some blame for not realizing they were eating the wrong thing, but it should not have been a situation.  In the end, the server offered to charge us for the meal ordered, but then wound up not being able to do that.  They comped an appetizer to help, but that was on anther person's tab.    All in all, I will give them another shot someday.....maybe.  But with the Phoenix food market being what it is, It is not a high priority.",

    "text": "After the amazing dinner experience I had here, I truly can not believe that Hillstone doesn't have a 5 star rating! I loved everything about it. The food. The atmosphere. The service. All top notch!   Since Tuesday nights are horrible for celebrating birthdays, my boyfriend treated me to dinner at Hillstone the following Saturday. We came around 7:00pm and were told there was an hour wait. (FYI, they don't take reservations). Luckily for us, there was one table open outside that we were able to relax at in the meantime. Never had I ever sat on a patio with air conditioning vents under the table, cooling your legs. Impressed from the start! A really nice, funny server took care of us as we had wine and french fries. At exactly the one hour mark, an inside booth was ready for us!  My bf had the Hillstone Burger with coleslaw. It was definitely worthy of being his only cheat meal of the week. There were multiple items on the menu that sounded great, but I ultimately ordered the Salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Excellent choice, self! It was delicious. Another unique detail that I'd never seen before: Lemons were served in a cloth-like mesh bag to keep seeds from getting squeezed into your iced tea or food.   Then...surprise! Our server brought out a hot fudge sundae (with a candle on top) and a Nordstrom box. As it turns out, my bf had sneakily ordered dessert and given her my birthday gift while I was in the restroom. I did not see that coming! Haha. It was such a big bowl of ice cream that we couldn't finish it, but I will say that getting to pour the chocolate sauce on yourself was pretty fun.   All in all, it was a fabulous night and I'm so glad that a friend recommended Hillstone to us. I would definitely come back and suggest it to others for a special night out.",

AND the prices were reasonable!   I had previously had dinner here also and can't recommend more highly the unique and amazing choices!",

Of course you don't have to have cheese. Sides include killer show string potatoes. Super fresh. Kale salad with cashews. Very flavorful. So I did both. Wine list is nice. A few selections in each varietal by the glass.  I went with the Russian River Pinot after the bartender offered a couple tastes of some other possibilities.  Great bar that I enjoyed my dinner at. As well as lovely dining in and outside. Bustling with a mix of locals and travelers like myself. The bartender knew his locals but was very attentive. It's pretty noisy. Nice romantic atmosphere however. Great choice.",

I know what the food is like.  It's worth it.  We had the salmon appetizer.  Outstanding!  I had the salmon entree for dinner, and it was excellent as well. My fiance had the Caesar salad.  Oh. My. God.  That salad was one of the best Caesars we had ever had.  I wish that I had ordered one, but I was getting full.  He had it with the fried oysters.  Not really my thing, but he loved it.  I must eat that Caesar salad again!  Mine will be without fried oysters.  :-)  For dessert I ordered the ice cream sundae.  It looked interesting to me.  I saw someone else with it, and it had a good sized gravy boat of hot fudge.  I wanted to try it.  I like ice cream, but it is not my \"ride or die\" as they say.  This one might be.  Homemade vanilla ice cream, and chocolate syrup/fudge with the richest whipped cream I have ever eaten.  My first bite was incredible.  I could not believe that it tasted so good.  I was completely blown away by it.  If all ice cream tasted like that then I get it.  Great night!  Great food.  I wish it was closer to Gilbert.  I cannot wait to go back!",

    "text": "Great food and great service.   I came here for lunch the other day and really enjoyed their food. My reservation was at 12:30pm, arrived around 5 mins before thinking they will have valet parking available but I was wrong. Took me a good 5 mins to find a spot then a couple of mins to walk, needless to say I was late, last one in my group to show up... I was wearing new heels, walking any distance wasn't what I wanted to do.  When I walked in, they were busy, people were waiting for tables, I highly recommend making reservations.  Our table started with smoke salmon appetizer. Their smoke salmon tasted like what I had at a fish market in Seattle from the first time I was there over 10 years ago. Yes it was that good.  I had ahi tuna salad for my lunch. It was so nicely presented, really loved all the color used, it looked very tasty and it sure was.  Just right portion size for lunch. I got to taste ahi tuna burger, it was cooked and flavored so well, I would be happy to have either ahi tuna salad or tuna burger.  Since I ate well for lunch, I decided to be bad and order dessert. We shared strawberry short cake and browny. Strawberry short cake was just okay but really liked the browny.  Carmel sauce mixed together with ice cream nicely complimented browny.  Service was excellent. They had more than one person assigned to our table, so it seemed, kept coming back to refill drinks. One of a person from our table had Diet Coke. It was served in a bottle. I hardly ever drink soda but it looked refreshing to see soda in a bottle.",

I've been here several times and am never disappointed. The location in the heart of the Biltmore area can't be beat and the atmosphere is upscale and classy without being stuffy, making Hillstone a great date night spot. You simply cannot go wrong with the Tuna Mango, Shrimp & Macadamia, or Thai Tuna rolls. If you're me you go ahead and order all three! As for the House Specialties, the pan roasted salmon and USDA prime filet (ordered rare of course!) are phenomenal. For cocktails I like The Crush {Belvedere Vodka | fresh grapes | basil} and a simple (but ever potent) Kettle One martini. Another great thing about Hillstone is the service is always top notch. You can bring friends from out of town or colleagues here and you'll never have to worry about the experience being soured by poor service.",

MUY DELICIOSO!!!!! Oh and the Ribs are a massive thing to behold, at first I though there was no way I would even finish half but I did, it was that good I guess that eating it was a very smooth journey of pure meaty goodness that I was able to accomplish to about 3/4 of the way that was because I was full to the heart!! We really enjoyed and loved this place!! We cannot wait to go back again and sink our teeth into another dish of pure goodness!! This place is a must for those who haven't decided to go on in!! Thank us later!!! :)  High five and an A+++",

Not just from our server but every one that walks by our table made us feel special and always smiled. The food is just as good as the service. The artichoke special was the best. We have a favorite back home but these artichokes were better.  We also split a wedge salad and they bring us 2 ice cold plates, perfect.  My wife always has to have the fries and they were perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside. Finished with sushi, being Japanese descent I normally only eat sushi at a quality Japanese restaurant but Hillstone excels here too.  A basic sushi menu but fresh fish presented beautifully. We will be back.",

We are big fans of the Chicago-style spinach dip with salsa and sour cream on the side. The Hawaiian ribeye (even well done) has a great, juicy flavor. My husband loves the prime rib and homemade horseradish sauce. The barbecue baby back ribs are also very tasty. . The loaded baked potato with bacon, cheese and sour cream is the perfect complement to the steaks or ribs. We sampled French fries while waiting on a table and they are even tasty. Our conclusion about Hillstone is that it's definitely as good - if not better - than Houston's. A definite 5-star place in our book, and we drive about 30+ minutes to eat here. They also take reservations, which is a plus.",

I've been a huge fan of Houston's for years, and had mixed emotions when I heard that they were closing the Phoenix location and opening just down the street under their parent company name, Hillstone.  But after one visit, I'm sold...   Hillstone has the same favorite dishes that Houston's had (spinach dip, grilled artichoke, veggie burger, fresh vegetable sides, fries, desserts, etc...) and they have a huge wine list as well.  Service is attentive and sweet (thanks McKenna who was our waitress last night).  Thanks also for going above and beyond and creating rootbeer floats for our table upon request!  The Hillstone group did a fabulous job building this new restaurant - it's got a great outdoor seating area, a huge bar, an awesome wine cellar, and comfy booths inside as well.  If you still want the old name (Houston's), the location in Scottsdale / Hilton Village is still open, but I highly recommend checking out Hillstone to change it up just a bit.  Welcome to Phoenix, Hillstone, and yay for me... first to review!",

We tried the tuna mango and it was the perfect blend of sweet and spice. I ordered the California burger for lunch. Best burger I've had in a long time. Three other people came with me and they absolutely loved their dishes as well. The waiters/waitresses made sure our water glasses stayed full during our entire stay.

I was devastated when i found out they are closing the Houston's in Scottsdale next year and heard that Hillstone is basically the same, (it replaced the Houston's in Phoenix). I work right across the street, so finally I figured I'd give it a shot.  The restaurant is beautiful, the staff is nice, but the Caesar salad (my favorite) was terrible compared to Houston's. There was corn in it, which I'm not totally understanding and some larger clumps of lettuce that made the salad uneven and harder to share. I'm afraid to try to the burger... but in fairness, the salmon appetizer was just as good.  CONCLUSION: Don't close Houston's. It's better. End of story.",

All the employees are extremely knowledgeable about the menu items and their ingredients, which allows them to make recommendations to fit your dietary needs.  Plus for the Gluten Free Avenger.  The quality of food produced in Hillstone's kitchen is amazing, so amazing that I have never had a bad meal.  Yes, not once have I had a bad meal.  High quality food with a fair price point considering the service, atmosphere, and menu options.    This is my favorite restaurant in the Valley, hands down.  I am extremely impressed by the menu, service, atmosphere choices of patio, bar, and inside sitting.  Only negative comment is that when they are busy, they are BUSY, you have to wait.  But to be expected from a superb restaurant that can reproduce high quality food and service every time.    Menu Pros:   Salmom Trout, if they bring it back Hawaiian rib eye The sushi.  Yea, highly impressed.  Knocks most places out of the park. bake Nice little house salad.  Simple but amazing.",

I somehow always manage to get their sushi and it is always good Not the best but definitely good The service is always really great It is a pretty dim restaurant and can be chilly sometimes... On my last visit I wanted to have a drink with my dinner so since I was having sushi, a rainbow roll, so I was thinking a sake bomb. Might seem a little odd for the place but I was just feeling it... Come to find out, they do not carry sake But they do have Kirin... Our server was nice enough to go and check to see if the bar had any sake... Turns out, they had one last small bottle of sake... I was happy and I would have been happy even if they didn't have the sake but... For the server to go out of his way to check... It made me happy Great service... I had my sushi and it was good My sake bomb was wonderful... It was a cool experience... A bunch of the servers would walk by and notice my sake bomber and make comments like  \"Sushi and sake go together, idk why we don't carry it all the time\" And \"\"People ask for sakebombers but we usually don't carry it\"  Maybe something that will get to the owners/managers...  Overall Hillstone is great and the service is always wonderful...",

    "text": "Ahh, Hillstone.  Consistently delivers quality service and food.   The biggest disappointment is having to wait for a table on a busy weekend night, but it is always worth it!      A few recommendations:  - Call ahead for reservations for dinner  - Order a glass of Mi Sueno (yum!)  - Try their California roll.  I know it sounds crazy but it is by far the BEST California roll you will ever have.  I typically hate Cali rolls but this one is legit.  Who knew a place like Hillstone would have great sushi rolls?  They make theirs with real crab and the best part is that they don't skimp on the crab to rice ratio.  Okay I'm drooling now...  - Thai steak salad is delicious and very filling.   - Although a little pricier than some of the other items, try their Hawaiian Ribeye.   Ordered mine medium rare and it was \"OMG yum\" worthy.  - French dip is also a must try.  Perfectly prepared every time.  Last night I ordered it and they seemed to have changed the cut of their fries (typically shoe string, which I prefer).  - Order the ice cream sundae for dessert and share it with friends.  We like to flip the bowl of ice cream, nuts and whipped cream over into the main dish and drizzle all of the hot chocolate on top.  Perfect for sharing and always a great way to end a delicious meal.",

Hostess (who was also our server), was very friendly & accommodating.  We ordered a couple of House Made Veggie Burgers (in hopes of something comparable to the late J. Alexander's in Scottsdale).  I ordered mine without the bun, which was displayed with a bigger slice of tomato & large pieces of lettuce to take the bun's place.  The flavor and texture was great!  Jamie was a great server (we never had an empty glass or our plates sitting on the table).  She was prompt and very polite.    This was a great experience...we'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "IF THERE WAS A ZERO THAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH RIGHT NOW!!!  This star used to be at the 5 mark especially due to their salads, BBQ, and French Dip!!!!  Here's the story!      To give a little background about myself it is that I am married to my husband who is 70 and I around the 40 mark.  We are opposites in sight....He is buttoned up shirt and shorts and I am full sleeved tattoos and am more of a t-shirt kinda guy (The t-shirt in question is a cartoonish glow in the dark skeletal outline)  Don't get me wrong I do dress up well when the occasion calls for it.      On July 26, 2015 at approximately 1 p.m., my spouse and I had run errands, met with people and went home, showered and put on our CLEAN weekend work clothes.  We decided we wanted a good salad and the first place that popped into my head was Hillstone.  We get to the entrance door which was propped open by I am assuming the last patrons who had exited the building.  We walk in and close the door behind us.  We are greeted by a sweet smiling you woman all in black and asks how many; we say \"Two please\".  She says \"Right this way\".  We follow her up a slightly slanted ramp to a dead end and take a right to a standard table for four.  She places down the menus on the table and my spouse begins to sit.  As I pick my chair which was the one where my back would face the window and begin to pull it out to sit, the lady in black says \"Do you have a different shirt with you?\"  OKAY this pissed me off!  I turned around and shooed my hands towards the table in a \"whatever\" type of motion and walked out mumbling things I don't wish to repeat past 3 occupied tables, pushing the door open and realizing how embarrassing that was.  I understand if there is a dress policy (Which we did not see anywhere and later are told it apparently is on one of the doors as we entered, perhaps the one we had to pull shut.  If we were told I had \"inappropriate\" attire on when we walked in the door at the beginning I would not be so disappointed, hurt and embarrassed. On Yelp it states that the dress is \"Casual\" which could mean many a thing.  I am sure professional musicians who have stepped in the doors of this establishment have not even been questioned about the dress code.      I felt I was misrepresented as a client.  The worst thing you can do is make a person feel so inferior for the most trivial reasons and think it can just be categorized under an \"oops\" moment.  I am not one to play the \"gay\" card; however, I do feel that tattoos and the appearance of someone based on their tattoos is a different card altogether.....No!  It is a different GAME altogether!  I usually let things slide off and carry on with my day, but this was humiliating.  I don't care what people think of me, but I sure as hell do care about other people like me who have the same type of situations happen to them.    For being overpriced the food WAS wonderful!  I would take clients as well as family, friends and my attorney here to eat on occasion.  I think its time to look around for less judgmental companies to accept my hard earned money.",

The food is great here, and if there is any problem with anything, which is not often, they make it right and fix it promptly. This is the whole package. Great, and I mean perfect service...not too much, and not to little. And if you need something while your server is helping someone else, any waiter you see coming or going will help you as if they were your server. Now, the food is excellent, real food, exactly what you're craving in well prepared American food or sushi. Steaks, burgers, ribs, fish... When our son comes home from college, this is always where he wants to go. The atmosphere is fantastic, music is at a perfect level and relaxing, and lighting is serine. And the seating, no matter where you sit, is comfortable..thank you. We've been coming here (was Houstons across the street originally) since before our son was born and brought him through the years. When he's 21 next summer, he's going to order a good beer with the rest of us!",

We all had delicious entrees - the crispy oysters, the Thai steak and noodle salad, the French dip sandwich and the pan-roasted salmon. The Duckhorn chardonnay by the glass was very good and it was great that they offered a good-quality non-alcoholic beer (Becks), as well. The only downside to the experience was that the restaurant was a bit noisy, but that is a common complaint these days. We will definitely return.",

It was lightly breaded, crisp, and perfectly seasoned.    Now, the portion is smaller, and the cauliflower is rubbery.    What's fun about that?  I could cite other details, but everything pretty much follows the same theme:  Smaller Portions.   Lesser Quality.

We were met by a very friendly and helpful server who took great care of us the entire evening.  We started out with a wonderful wine recommended by our server, she let us taste 3 kinds before we chose what suited us.  We went on to enjoy the savory spinach and artichoke dip as well as fresh baked bread served with some olives and olive oil.  The caeser salad was a very large portion almost could have been my entree and the dressing was so fresh and light.  The croutons crisp and fresh baked.  We all ordered the hawaiian ribeye, OMG!! So moist and so juicy - the flavor was so fabulous and I could only eat half of it.  The loaded baked potato was also wonderful and very large.  I ended up taking half my meal home and was really happy that they let us sit quite awhile to chat with our friends after our meal was over (we were way too full for dessert however the server brought us a complimentary slice of key lime pie which my husband and friends said were fabulous I just was too full to try it) we never were rushed out and they kept refilling our drinks I can't wait to go back.  Was always a fan of Houston's in NYC and this was very much the same and enjoyed the jazzy low music in the background and the dim lighting that was warm and relaxing.",

    "text": "I got a $100 gift card to Houston's restaurant for Christmas.  I decided to save it for mine and my boyfriend's 7th anniversary in February.  The friend who gave me the gift card recommended I go the the restaurant in 26th Street and Camelback, rather than th one in Scottsdale, which I live next to.  Houston's and HIllstone are the same company, they just name their restaurants different things.  Anyway, my friend recommended the one on Camelback, so we went there.  My guy and I arrived around 6:30-ish, and we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table.  When they called our name, we went inside, and the place was packed to the gills and it was NOISY.  Like, techno-dance club noisy.  We had to raise our voices pretty high as we leaned towards each other over the table to discuss what we were going to order.  We gave up on conversation at that point.  There's not a whole lot on the menu, and it's really straight-forward.  IF you look on the Hillstone restaurant website, you can browse the menu before you go.    We both ordered the same thing: the hawaiian rib-eye that came with the side of loaded baked potato, both of us ordered a caesar salad, and I ordered us a plate of the grilled artichokes as an appetizer.   The artichoke came out before the salad, which was weird, but no big deal.  And, the artichoke was heaven on a plate!  Seriously, I could have made a meal out of those things alone.  I think there was olive oil drizzled over them before they were grilled, and then then I'm not sure what seasonings they used, but there was definitely sea salt sprinkled over them before they were brought out.  They aren't on the menu, which is surprising considering how many of them we saw being delivered.   My only concern was: how to properly and politely eat it in a nice restaurant.  Rather than look ill-mannered, I simply asked our server how to politely partake of this dish, and she laughed and said there wasn't really a polite way, ya just gotta use your fingers and dig in.  I can get behind that! So, I thanked her and we happily dug in, and it was just delicious.  The caesar salads were also delicious, and the dressing was unlike any caesar I'd had before.  Most caesare dressings tend to be more cream-based, or at least have a creamy texture, while this one seemed more oil-based, and wasn't really creamy at all.  But, it was still good, and I'd order it again.   Our entrees came out after that, and the baked potate was really big and covered with sour cream, grated white cheddar cheese, chives, and real pieces of chopped up bacon.   The steak was a nice sized.  We ordered them done medium, and I think they were a bit more medium-rare, but that's a chance you take at steakhouses.  Everyone has different ideas of what rare, medium and well mean.  But, my boyfriend likes his steaks pretty pink, and I like mine REALLY pink, we we were both fine with it. There wasn't a description of what \"hawaiian\" meant, but usually it means a sweeter flavor.  I'm not big on sweet flavors combined with meats, so...it was a little off-putting when the steak had a sweeter flavor, but it was still really good.  I'm not a big rib-eye fan, as I prefer leaner cuts like sirloin and filet mignon, but this one was pretty good.  The baked potato was definitely generous sized, but there was no butter on it, and the cheddar cheese and the bacon pieces really overpowered the flavor of everything else, plus no butter meant that the inside of the potato was dry.  However this is easily remedied: next time, I'll tell them to hold the cheese and bacon, and ask for some butter.  Problem easily solved.  All in all, the only issues I had were small ones that weren't really a big deal.  The staff was very efficient and courteous.    Prices: the grilled artichokes: $11, Rib-eye entree: $28, salads: $4, soft drinks: about $3, I think.  Altogether, with tip, the bill came to about $110 for two people.  And, for some reason, when you order soft drinks, they bring them to you in a glass bottle, with a glass of ice.  Never seen that before in a restaurant, especially not a more upscale one like this.  Bottom line? I'll be back.  Terrific service, terrific food, but be prepared for a long wait time for a table.  And due to the noise level, and crowd, DON'T go if you're trying to have a nice, quiet, romantic evening with someone special.",

I had the ahi tuna salad (flying tuna I think it was called?) and it was delicious.  My husband and friend had the swordfish special and that was cooked perfectly and the veggie mix was amazing.  My friend's husband had their ribs and they were so tender and literally fall off the bone.  I would definitely go back and recommend it.  The bar is a great 'hang out' also.  2 thumbs up!",

My coworkers and I started off with the salmon and artichoke. I tried artichoke before, but I was not a fan so I was a little hesitant to try it again, but I am so glad I did. Their artichoke was so good and the salmon was even better. MMMMMM...goodness! Then I had the Hawaiian Rib-eye with Fries. My meal was wonderful and I practically ate it all. My boss had the Barbecue Pork Ribs and the meat was like falling off the bones. It was ultra good!",

Houston's at the Esplanade has been a favorite of ours for years, but last night confirmed our feelings once again. After being told that the wait would be 15 minutes, we decided to go out to the patio and order our drinks. Less than 5 minutes later we were seated at our table. Impressive already! Our appetizers were wonderful! I didn't like artichoke until last night! Total Yum! My husband had the usual, the Pork Ribs and loved them.  As for me, I had the Grilled Halibut and couldn't be happier! The freshness and quality of my dish was to die for! I love Houston's!",

    "text": "Holy steroids batman, when did you start taking DHEA? This is my new date place. Great food, good to great service and atmosphere.  For an upper priced/higher tiered restaurant this is really, really good. I've had just about everything on the menu but I usually order one of the specials which is usually a fresh seafood choice. Never a bad meal, always fresh veggies which are usually cooked al dente. The fish is as fresh as it gets in Phoenix/Scottsdale........probably three to five days from sea to table.  I think they are trying to source their kitchen locally which really appeals to me. One of the servers was talking about the fresh pecans they got from Tucson and they were using it on a desert.  The main crowd is the see-me set but that doesn't bother me. Plenty of professionals, families and couples. A good eclectic mix.  They don't take reservations and they won't seat you unless your entire party is with you.  The bar is really good. The guy who made my drink was experienced and has many tools at his disposal to make the really great cocktails that you always heard about but you've never experienced. If you want to have a Singapore sling, it will be made from scratch like they do at the Raffles hotel in Singapore(not premixed sugar crap). This is the place to order a tom collins, whiskey sour or even a mojito( they actually muddle the mint)Good scotch collection, not great.  One other thing, I went there for lunch with a business associate of mine and there must have been a special on the hamburger because every person I saw in there was eating the burger. And, there were a lot of people in there. I would say its a 4 star burger.  Bon Apetite!",

I think Houston's is the most consistent restaurant that I've ever been to and I've been dining at various locations of Houston's since I was a kid. Since I've lived in PHX, the Biltmore location has been my home base and I eat there several times a month. Most of the time, we come in for a late dinner and sit at the bar and let Tom and Al take care of us. These two are among the best bartenders in the Valley and will remember your drink of choice and other preferences after just a few visits.",

We ordered the fire roasted artichoke and it was to die for.  It was so good, i'm now googling the heck out of fire herb roasted artichoke to make my own.  My son told me the artichoke was the best veggie he's eaten and he's a picky eater.  My beer was served very cold, the service was great.  Their menu is sort of basic and not foo foo.....; salads, burgers, steaks, etc. They seem to put a lot of care and quality into each dish.  You won't be disappointed.",

Just had lunch and from the parking, the unfinished patio where I can only order apps and what can only be described as the worst sushi second only to the bulk garbage at the supermarket..the experience is a total let down..some one told me the name is a result of the fact if you have more that 20 restaurants with the same name you have to add calorie info. Houston's has 20+  so why not just change 1 or 2 to the awesome, roll off the tongue Hillstone. .Back to the sushi...enough with the sesame seeds ok I want to taste the fish! The rolls were down right gross..and the price...really I don't think so..Stick with the burgers, steak and side and I sure you will be satisfied.. ps..Your sushi stinks get rid of it",
