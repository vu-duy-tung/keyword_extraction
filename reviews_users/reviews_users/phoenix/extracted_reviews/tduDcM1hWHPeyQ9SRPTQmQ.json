Don't know if this is the best in the area...I will keep looking.",

There were people there enjoying the BBQ, but it was calm, relaxed and the food didn't take long. Most places are much more hectic during lunch. Billy was so friendly! We loved the BBQ and Chicago feel in Arizona. She also let us try some fried mac n cheese. YUM! I loved it and would have probably not known to order it as a side on my own. Thanks so much!!",

Ordering was quick and took my dinner back to the hotel.  Opened it up noticed how much sauce was on the brisket,  taste was okay.  I think they use oak for the smoke,  I could be wrong.  The brisket had very little smoke,  no smoke ring that I could see.  Overall, just okay BBQ.  I did like the hot BBQ sauce..",

Smoke  This place has a fantastic sauce that I think I would eat on everything from waffles to eggs! Ok, maybe I am stretching a little there, but not by much.  Now what to put under the sauce?  They have all the classics; pulled pork, brisket, chicken, chicken wings, etc. etc.  For me, it has been, since my first visit, all about the hot links.  My mouth is watering just thinking about them!  Great flavor, and that sauce doesn't cover it up, but really shows it off.  I am so blown away by these links that I will have to eat them a few more times before I can given anything resembling a useful review.  All of the sides are scratch-made, and the flavors show that off.  My favorites are the red beans and rice, and the potato salad.  Good prices, great portions, and wonderfully entertaining staff!",

Anyhow I go in yesterday and see a sign saying 9.99 pulled pork Dinner I don't know why but I assumed this was the sandwich and the only difference is an extra side being the \"Dinner\".   I was completely wrong I got a huge side of pulled pork only and was like h I wanted the sandwich I'm sorry take this back and give me a sandwich please literally some bread would have done the trick. Did she turn around and take my meal back to get bread..... NO she did not she stood there staring at me as if I was Donald Trump and she hated what I stood for. I've seen the look before she had words she wanted to tell me but decided she was at work and probably should not do that. At that point feeling the like she would probably spit in my food  I asked for the money back for both my wife's and my meal. She then stated oh I was going to help you out I replied well that's not what it seemed like. I'm really disappointed that someone who probably has not even worked there very long can ruin such a good place to eat. Make it known when you lose the girl with the prejudices and we'll return thanks ...",

I'm from Wisconsin and still being close to Chicago, we get a lot of this style food. I was craving a place like back at home and noticed this place on Baseline. When you walk into the place it has that Chicago style smell and looks.   For the first few months I stuck with the ribs and pulled pork. They put a little cole slaw on the bottom of the pulled pork which makes it have a sweeter taste to it. Genius! Just recently though I have been getting either their ALL YOU CAN EAT FISH FRY, which they have everyday of the week. The fish is breaded perfectly. You might as well already order seconds when you place your order because you will be getting more. I'm not a big guy and my record is five orders in one sitting.  Overall, the only bad thing I would have to say about Tom's BBQ is no beer. I love sitting down and having some hearty food while drinking a cold beer, because nothing adds to the flavor of fish and BBQ than a cold Miller Lite.  Tom's BBQ is amazing and be careful because you will be craving it once you go there, which isn't a bad thing at all.",

If you have great meat, you don't need to hide it under generic BBQ sauce. The rolls were so hard and I couldn't tell if the crap on top of it was flour (obviously store-bought) or mold. The woman who served us was somewhat inappropriate, though friendly. I didn't need to see her asscrack and thong, either. Horrible experience. Def won't be going back! $35 for two people and the vast majority of it got thrown away. The thong lady asked the table next to us 4 times how they were doing but never once asked us.

I've had Texas BBQ and New Orleans BBQ before--some places are good and others are eh.  This is the first time I have ever had Chicago BBQ, and this is definitely one of those rare spots to compare all others to.  Every bite was tender and tasty, and their sauce had the perfect balance of flavors.  Billie, the lady behind the counter, was really friendly.  When there were no orders to be taken, she was out on the floor shootin' the bull with us and it made for a really pleasant evening of food and conversation for both my wife and I.  Recommended?  Oh hell yeah.  Eventually, my wife and I are going to have to get back to vegetarianism after our long absence, but  places like this make what we have to do a bit harder.  When we finally do decide get back to the realm of bunny food, I have a good mind to come back here one more time and go out with a bang.",

But as we sometimes say in New York, Fuhgedabout it! I've had BBQ in Chicago and this place doesn't come close.   I paid $20 for a 3-meat combo with 2 sides and a fountain drink. The one rib they placed on top was good, although not great. the five underneath it were thin and dry. The chicken and brisket were also dry as DUST! The baked beans were so tiny and drowning in a mug of thick molasses like sauce that I couldn't even taste them. Even my Diet Pepsi tasted over carbonated. The jalapeno mac & cheese was a fire-eating taste treat and that's the only thing I can half recommend about this place, other than the fast and friendly service. VERY poor food, unfortunately.",

We didn't have any questions about the menu because I was sold On the pulled pork before we even walked in. While we waited for our food we got to know Billie, let me just say, I wanted to stay and hang out with her for hours! Once our food arrived I took the first bite of my generously portioned pulled pork sandwich and then another and another. The food was incredible! Juiciest pulled pork I have ever had. Fried pickles were perfect, jalapeno Mac and cheese was to die for, and the potato salad was also impressive!!  Thanks for the wonderful conversation and mouth watering food. We will be back, quite possibly tomorrow!!  Oh and I almost forgot about the food challenge!",

A plus also is their coleslaw is made w/o mayo which made me very happy and is great with the pork. They have a huge menu with lots of options you are sure to find something you will like. The sides for me in general are just ok to be honest but when I come here I come for the meat anyway.  My boyfriend loves their ribs and also their fried zucchini are huge and cooked just right.

Companion and I have dined at this location a number of times, and we usually order the same thing each time.  Companion orders the chicken sandwich, jalapeno mac and cheese, a brownie and a drink. I usually order rib tips, cole slaw, and a drink. We have never been disappointed.  Companion's chicken was moist, and filled the entire bun. The Mac and Cheese had perfectly cooked al dente noodles with loads of cheese on them. The brownie was moist and perfectly chewy and chocolatey.  I order my rib tips without sauce as I prefer to taste the meat with just a little sauce in the background, and they always perfectly oblige my wishes. Their cole slaw is hard to beat; creamy and crunchy with excellent flavor.  Staff is always friendly and most helpful. They take all credit cards including  Amex.  At the risk of sounding prejudiced, this is my go to place for BBQ, and I do eat there fairly regularly. It is clean and relatively quiet. At holiday time you can have them smoke your turkey for you at a very reasonable price.   My only wish is that they would have smoked lamb. I once had a sandwich of it and thought I went to heaven, but that was some time ago.  4 stars for cleanliness, good food, nice sized portions, and wonderful customer service.",

Tom's is the same.  Usually the ambiance is booths and plain tables-and-chairs.  Often you order at a counter and they bring you the food.  Tom's is the same.  Prices are usually a bit more than fast food but not as much as regular sit-down restaurants.  You guessed it - Tom's is the same.  But this Tom's has a problem.  Consider the brisket platter for about $10, which consists of brisket, a biscut, and a side.  What could be so bad?  Well, it was the brisket.  The portion consisted of about 3 ounces (maybe 4) of meat utterly covered in a sweet BBQ sauce -- not cooked with the sauce, just inundated with it.  Ok - scrape it off, you will suggest.  So I did.  What was underneath was small slices entirely from the fatty part of the brisket.  Half of my small portion of meat was fat, and not crispy tasty fat but soggy discouraging muck.  The pictures on the wall showed lots of lean slices from the first cut of the brisket -- misleading? or downright fraudulent?  Now I see why they put 6 ounces of BBQ sauce on 3 ounces of meat.  I notice that the rest of our group of six was eating their food, mostly, but without any outward signs of real pleasure.  That at least was comforting - misery loves company.",

The prices are fair for the amount of meat and the gastronomical  experience you'll get after eating their pulled pork sandwich.   We visited ths spot after reading all the positive reviews on Yelp, so it's a definite must eat in Phoenix and Tempe! Thanks for the great response from this place from other Yelpers because it's well worth it.   The service was friendly and perfectly suited for this place. I don't remember the gals name but she had a great southern style charm that made you feel like family and made you laugh.   The side sauces were amazing with your choice of regular and spicy. Both were flavorful and delicious so I recommend getting both and alternating.   The brisket looked delicious too, so my next visit will be to try that.  Definitely a must eat in Phoenix!",

So nice and caring and very concerned about the appearance and performance of their restaurant.  I have been back 4 times since and the food seems to get better.  It is a little pricey, but worth it!! You are supporting a real small business that deserves your patronage!  You must try a Beef from there.  It is a different sandwich than Al's, so it is tough to compare, but if you love classic Chicago Beef this is the place for you!  if you have never been to Chicago this is a True taste of it!",

Just soaked in tangy BBQ sauce and pork sliced so perfectly I wasn't upset when it fell outta the bun a bit. Topped with a hefty spponful of cole slaw the texture was just the right amount of creamy and crunchy that I licking my fingers after.  We also got a boat of fried pickles. Cut into spears not round ridges, I thought they were delightful. A country girl myself, I grew up frying things and Tom's did pickles justice. Even without ranch to dip.",

Luckily someone with common sense stepped in and took orders in that line. Then he gave me wrong change and took 3 tries for him to get it right. $100-$14=$86.  Not $46. Not $94.

And trust me I'm so awkward and hate making small talk with any cashiers at restaurants but you can just tell they genuinely care and what you order.

Today I had a regular sized brisket sandwich ($6.99) that was perfectly smoked with minimal fat to cut off. Last week I had an excellent pulled pork jumbo sandwich ($8.99).  I still think their BBQ sauce is too sweet for my tastes. The buns hold up to the meaty sandwich. The sides are just average. The super-thin dill pickle slice on the side with sandwiches is perfect for cutting these meaty dishes (just wish it was a little bigger, or maybe 2 of these super-thin ones).

She then asked if our order was going to be to-go and we said we would rather eat there and she sighed and went back to ask someone in the kitchen so we just walked out. By the time we walked out it was only 8:35pm and closing time isn't until 9:00pm! So here I am typing this at 8:45pm from SomeBurros next door. If you want to close up and get out by 9:00-9:30pm then maybe you should consider moving up your closing time. That's the first and the last time we will be visiting, unfortunately since the food smelled great!",

    "text": "So we love BBQ.. Just gonna start off with that. We want our meat to be fresh and hell just off of grill type of meat!.   This place did not have that. It was like we got the damn left overs.  My husband got the pulled pork sandwich his results: warmed up, gotten from the bottom the tray, and ruined the sandwich.  Grandpa got the beef brisket sandwich results: not fresh, it was cold, dry, tough, and you can tell has been sitting out because there was absolutely no pink anywhere in those tough slices. I got a hot link sandwich results: burned hot links, extremely dry and tough.  Overall, not going back. The lady was an interesting character, a customer notified her that the root beer was out. She said \"okay don't touch it\". And did nothing about it. The inside to me is pretty gross as far as the kitchen goes.. So i chose 1 star because I have to and Because the BBQ Sauce is OKAY!",

I thought that was reasonable and started back to my car.  Halfway back I hear Billie a dynamic ex New Yorker say \" I will open for you, baby\"  the experience was awesome from that point on.  She made me feel she owned the place.   Let's get to the food.  I had the rib tip dinner with homemade Cole slaw and  baked beans that had bits of rib tip (delicious).  The rib tips were nice and tight not parboiled type.  The Cole slaw did not have mayonnaise which was different for me and yet it was excellent. She gave me a taste of their brisket which was moist.  Could have used more smoke for my taste. Oh, I almost forgot.  Go with the homemade spicy sauce.  Perfect. I am taking a Italian beef sandwich and half slab of ribs home.  I will be back.",

It came well cooked, but was already drowned in regular sauce that wasn't anything fantastic. They have a decent spicy sauce, but pouring water over rain just makes things more wet.  The side of bread comes out of a package and the beans were just too smoked that getting the full flavor out isn't possible.  I'll go back to try the Italian sausage, but I'm not expecting a meal to wow me.  If you want some quick BBQ, and it was darn quick with friendly service, this place is great. Unfortunately, the main meal I was interested in was abyssal and not worth recommending for $15.",

    "text": "While visiting Arizona I was driving down Baseline Road in Tempe and noticed a place called Tom's BBQ Chicago Style. What caught my eye in particular was the signage stating that they carried Chicago Style Italian Beef. The next time I went down Baseline road I made sure to stop by and give it a try.  I walked in to find a small restaurant. After looking over the menu I noticed they did indeed serve Chicago style hot dogs, and being the hot dog critic I obviously had to try one. I also ordered an Italian Beef as they had a big sign in front and I figured it must be a specialty of theirs, after about a 10 minute wait my food was ready.   We'll start with the Italian Beef. This Italian beef was bland, they had the soggy part right. The bread was right, it had the right texture and softness. The Italian Beef meat itself did not have the usual Italian Beef seasoning that I find in Chicagoland. I've had worse Italian Beef sandwiches, but for a place putting this at the top of their signage I would expect it to be better.  The hot dog was even worse. This was a giant sloppy mess of a hot dog. The poppy seed bun was the right type (not a given in Arizona), but there was about three hot dogs worth of mustard on this thing. There was way too much tomato and too thick, this caused tomato water to soak the bun causing the bun to become soggy. There was a thick and watery pickle slice that caused the bun to be even soggier. The relish was also applied too liberally, while it was the neon green style of relish typically found in Chicago the application was just a mess. There were two sport peppers about the length of the dog between the two of them. Then cucumber slices and practically no onion. The bun fell apart as I attempted to pick it up, this was just a total disaster of a hot dog and puts a bad name on Chicago style dogs.  Overall Tom's BBQ was a big disappointment. Despite signs indicating \"Chicago Style\" all over the outside, the two Chicago style food items I had here were lousy. Perhaps their BBQ is better but if and when I return to Arizona I'll take my chances elsewhere. Two stars for Tom's.",

Normally for a new BBQ place I would order the ribs (that is my 'go to' dish for any BBQ place. However, this time I ordered the Brisket Platter and my wife ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich *her favorite BBQ order\" for lunch. All I can say is WOW. In fact that is what I said after every bite. The brisket and pulled pork was off the charts. Cole slaw was a perfect accompaniment to the brisket and delicious. Even the fries are outstanding.  Gotta go back and get the RIBS!!!",

We got the bbq meat sampler and there was nothing I wanted to take two bites of. The ribs were fatty and flavorless, the chicken rubbery, the pulled pork was swampy. The bbq sauce was too sweet and none of my family liked it. The high point of the meal was the rolls. I will never go back here. I wish I could go back in time and eat somewhere else. The bathroom was gross as well. I will say that the cashier was nice.",

It's definitely not the best barbecue in town, but it's good for a bite to eat along the way and the place has some old town charm to it.  I usually get the pulled pork sandwich but this past time I've noticed that the meat to bread ratio was not favorable.  The buns were just too thick and bread-y, and I ended up not even eating the top one.  My boyfriend ordered the house sandwich and that definitely had a better meat to bread ratio.  Overall, it's a good restaurant.  Do you need to come here?  No, but it's a good place if you're looking for a casual restaurant and some good, comfort food.",

The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the price. This place is pretty expensive. I paid like $17 for a chicken sandwich combo which comes with a side and a drink, and I also ordered a brownie.  Brownie was not good in my opinion. The texture was not right, it was spongy.",

    "text": "Came here after a coworker recommended this place as the best barbecue in town. I didn't think I'd ever be a regular at a barbecue place (unless it's anything like Soulfire in Boston with the unlimited spicy sauces) because my boyfriend always adamantly insists \"I can cook this at home for cheaper!\" whenever we get barbecue BUT. I was proven so, so wrong.  The lady who's always at the register,  Billie, is quite the character and adds to the charm. I love how nice everyone is. Nobody's coming here for a candlelit dinner, let me tell you. But I think that's a good thing.  I've had the slab of ribs (good), house burger (OK), unlimited fried catfish  (every Friday, you have to request them to cook more every time you finish your plate), and the pulled pork burger. By FAR the best thing I've had thus far is the pulled pork sandwich! It's incredibly good.  Their peach pie dessert is all right. I don't really think it's worth the $3 price tag, but it'll hit the spot if you need something sweet after every savory meal. (Or mosey over to Aloha Yogurt on the other side of the lot for something light!)  Glad I live so close by. I'll have to try their unlimited rib tips night, which I think is every Thursday. Oh and they have tons of sauces to choose from next to the soda machine, including a bottle of sugar free barbecue sauce that's super low in calories!",

This is more Chicago style, which is a bit spicier that tastes best for me. Being a fan of Texas Style BBQ, when ordering a two or three meats plate one always has to be beef brisket not chopped. The pulled pork is consistently delicious and the brisket has a touch of fat. The Mac'n Cheese is amazing and super cheesy. Now what's the problem with Kraft Mac'n Cheese is it's never cheesy enough, but not here certainly not here. Get eat it...order it.",

    "text": "We love Tom's BBQ for the fried fish on Fridays. We have been frequent flyers for years. Visiting mainly the Ocotillo and Tempe location. Tonight was the absolute worst experience we have ever encounter with Tom's BBQ, let alone any establishment.   We called ahead to place an order for 20 pieces of fish and a large order of jalapeno Mac n cheese. The lady on the phone asked if we'd make it within the 20minutes until 9pm which is closing time and we expressed we would be there. Our order came to a total just shy of $70.   We showed up two minutes to spare to a locked door and three employees who ignored me at first; after a minute of persistence they acknowledged me in which we stated we were the call ahead order for pick up. They proceeded to shake their heads and tell us no, that they were closed.  We did not receive our food and little do they know, we drove over ten miles to get there and have a newborn at home. Needless to say it was not easy making it there in time in the first place and to be treated in such a way was appalling. I fairly doubt they made our order because why would they refuse us when we were on time? Not getting our food was not the worst part, it was the lack of customer care and the manner in which they addressed us. Never will we be customers at this location again.   We have driven to the McKellips location in which they are taking way better care of us. The Tempe location really needs an attitude check of their employees. My father owns a business and we would never want any of our customers being treated in such a way, let alone have anyone working for us whom treat others as such.",

As we walked in we were greeted nicely by the staff and they quickly took our order; you then take a seat and your entree is brought to your table. I ordered the pulled pork  special with fries and a fountain soda.  The sandwich was delicious; lots of pulled & chopped pork, a fresh hot bun, sweet bbq sauce, and hot crispy fries. The generous portion of fries appeared to be fresh-cut and were delicious.   Overall, a solid BBQ joint at a good price.",

The mashed potatoes seemed like they were maybe half (if not all) instant and half...canned garlic? I know it's fast food but I expected more from a place that boasts so much about the authenticity of their BBQ. I would have been happier going to an actual fast food place. My husband got a fish dinner plate. The fries were soggy and the fish was rubbery. I wish I ordered the Italian beef instead since this is a Chicago-themed establishment...

I suppose its a good thing that I always think of this place whenever I'm in the area, but that may be more of a case of \"better the devil you know.\"  From 96-2000, it was pretty much my reliable go-to place for BBQ.  Gotta love the diverse menu and creative combos, I believe that any BBQ fan can find their particular craving among the robust options.  Dollar-wise, I find Tom's to be quite kind.    Meats range from average to above-average to near-exceptional, with the brisket being the most reliably above-average meat for me.  The regular beef burger and rib tips might also warrant a consistent above average or even 4-star rating as well.  Ribs, chicken, dogs and fish - I've tried them all at one time or another - are all ok, albeit underwhelming.    Sides are ok, across the board.     Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place given how far you would have to drive to find something reliably better.  I suppose once you try a few different menu items, it is perfectly plausible to order a 4-star meal every time once you learn what to avoid.  The value is definitely there, so I figure its a venue worth a few of your trips.",

    "text": "I asked the girl behind the register what there most popular BBQ is.  She told me that their Italian Beef was popular.  When I try a place for the first time I like to have their signature food, because if that is no good the rest will be even worse.  There was only one other group of people there but it was midday so that isn't always a sign of anything.  I got my sandwich fairly quickly which is to be expected for food that is already made.  That is when the experience went down hill.  Apparently they marinate their bread in Au Jus because it was overwhelmingly soggy.  I brought it back up and said it was very soggy, and she informed me they often put some juice on it.  That may be the case but a freshly made sandwich does not get soggy within a minute.  That leads me to believe it was already made before I got it.  I got a replacement one, hold the JUICE.  This time it was a normal sandwich and the new problem was that it had zero taste.  It was the driest most flavorless beef sandwich I've eaten before.  I think I also got some potato salad which was mediocre as well.  Overall, the worst BBQ place I've been too.  I'm not surprised because Chicago people can't do anything right.  They screwed up pizza and the hot dog.  Which makes me wonder, why are Chicago people obsessed with reinventing the wheel?  Good BBQ already exists, no need to Chicago-style it and make it bad.  Good pizza is from NY, no need to add a few pounds of soggy deep-dish dough to screw it up.  If you're hot dogs were so good, why do you hide it under so many condiments?  Rant over.  Note to self, avoid anything that Chicago stole from another region and tries to claim it.",

I was forced to wait to place my order while the counter person told a personal story to some people who had already ordered.  I waited at least three minutes before she acknowledged me and asked if I wanted to order.  She really didn't look like someone who should be behind the counter. improperly dressed, did not know the counter, did not upsell me etc.  The food was fast, but really no flavor.  Pulled pork was dry and not that tasty.  The hot sauce was spicy, and the onion straws were over seasoned.  I have given up on Toms.  Am looking for new BBQ in Phoenix.  Honey Bears is not it either, but that is a different story.",

When i first heard of tom's i was skeptical, but after a year i was really dying for a good Italian beef. As soon as i entered the door, i knew i was in for a treat. The place didn't feel gimmicky with a Chicago theme, it just felt like i stepped right into Chicago. I felt at home.  I order a sandwich and the girl behind the counters asks, do i want it wet or dry. Being a fan of juice, i said wet. Little did i know i was going to get a soaking wet sandwich, and it was DELICIOUS.  I have made it a habit to always bring a friend when i'm craving Tom's, just to spread the love around.",

This place had some of the best, most helpful and friendly counter service I've seen in a long time.  She knew folks names.  She remembered things they'd eaten.  She offered recommendations for first time folks.  She had that way of making you feel like you were the smartest most special person she'd helped that day.  Miss your mom?  Come here for lunch.  Now the food was good to.  She said I'd made a great decision in picking their BBQ beans as my side and not until I tasted them did I think she was being more than polite.  These were awesome.  The beans still retained their good firmness, not all mushy and falling apart as some can be, and the sauce was really amazing.  I got the pulled pork sandwich which had been my plan, and she encouraged it as well as it's their most popular option.  The funky thing here is that they put a thin layer of cole slaw on the bottom bun, then add non-sauced meat on top, then pour sauce over the top and add the top of the bun.  VERY interesting.  I think next time I might try it without that - but it was certainly interesting.  Though they have a great selection, so I may just have to try one of their Chicago Hot dogs or Rome Rib Tips or Chicken.  SO many awesome looking options!    But really - you should go just for the sweet lady at the counter.  And all the figurines of pigs on the counter.  And Chicago memorabilia all over the walls.  It's just a nice place with good food.  Gotta love that.",

The owner is constantly trying to improve the menu which I love because it adds a new twist to things. This last time I went I had the Tom's Special sandwich with a side of Macaroni Salad and an order of Fried Zucchini. The Sandwich was juicy, tender and full of flavor as usual (the portion is really big so you may want to consider only eating half). The Macaroni was perfectly cool and creamy. The kicker was the Fried Zucchini; in the past times I've ordered this and it was smaller round slices; now they are fresh spears and taste so much better. The only thing I would change is the ranch sauce that I dipped the Zucchini in, I tend to lean more towards a thicker more sour cream based Ranch style. This place has the best customer service and the prices are spot on with the portion sizes. So for all my carnivores out there make sure you visit Tom's, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",

Credit card thin was the best descriptor.  Rib tips from the places I remembered back in Chicago were much thicker than this and had waaaaaaaaaaaay more meat.    The hot links really looked and tasted more like spicy hot dogs instead of italian sausage.  The sauce definitely left a LOT to be desired.  The aftertaste had me grabbing my drink faster than a Porsche 911 Turbo on nitrous gets from 0-60.    After the first bite, my wife and I tossed the stuff in the garbage and vowed NEVER to come back to this place because they have absolutely no idea how to do Chicago style BBQ properly.",

Let me just say this, the time to go to this place is around 3PM because you will get treated like a king (or in my case, a queen! :)  I didn't really know what to order, so many choices, and Billie working behind the counter gave me several suggestions. I  go with the smoked turkey sandwich and red beans & rice for my side. She let me sample the beans before I got them (just to make sure they weren't too spicy). When I sat down, she asked if I would like a sample of the pork. Of course I do!! And damn I should have ordered the pork because it was delicious! The smoked turkey was good too just not like the pork. The BBQ sauce they put on too is sweet and yummy!!   As I'm eating, Billie and another staff member come out and talk to me for about 20 minutes. Both are really cool, laid back people and enjoyed having some company (as I went in alone). The entire time I was there, nobody else came in so it was fun talking to the staff. Just want to point out they do get slammed for lunch and dinner but since 3PM on a Thursday is an odd time to eat, they weren't busy.   Definitely loved this place and will be returning!!",

    "text": "I've been here twice. First time - Italian Beef & Sausage Combo (by mistake), Maxwell St Polish  Italian Combo: I'd never had the combo anywhere before because I don't really love Italian Sausage (blasphemy, I know).  But when I got it home and bit into it, I'm glad they gave me the combo instead of just the beef.  I could tell that the beef sandwich alone would have been awesome - great tasting juice, tender beef, and all the right toppings.  The addition of the sausage didn't really improve the sandwich for me, simply because Ricobenes and Italian Beefs are my favorite things on baggies.  But it did make me realize that I do indeed like Italian Sausage sammiches.  The combo gave me two different experiences and neither overpowered the other, but came together to form an undeniably delicious sandwich.  Therefore, I recommend either the beef or sausage sandwich, or more importantly...the combo.    Polish: This is the Maxwell St...so its not just a regular polish you'd get at a cart somewhere on Central.  The grilled onions, mustard and peppers were all present on top of the familiar taste of that kind of sausage.  Hmmm...can't remember if it was a regular bun...drat.  Anyway, the ONLY problem was the sausage - it was a bit overcooked.  If it hadn't been, it would have been my first taste of a proper Maxwell St since Hippo's in Troy, MI.  Don't get me wrong, the taste was definitely legit here...just an unfortunate mishap on the sausage.  Went back yesterday as I was trying to avoid I-10 traffic.  This time I got the 2 Meat Combo with potato salad and red beans & rice.  Ribs and brisket were my meats.  Ribs - I have become a dry rub guy (seems like this review is filled with phrases that could be exploited), and I think the presence of an insane amount of sauce lessened my opinion of these ribs.  I like to judge a rib without sauce, but that was impossible because of how much they put on them.  Regardless, they were tender enough without being \"fake\".  However, they didn't have enough smokiness for my liking.  It was dark in the room, so I couldn't tell if there was a significant smoke ring or not.  All in all, you could do much worse.  But I think I'll probably pass on the ribs whenever I go back.  The Chicago offerings are much more intriguing.   Brisket - Can't complain whatsoever.  I haven't had a ton of brisket in my life, so maybe I don't know good brisket when I taste it.  But this was good to me.  A good smokey flavor, tender, and not crumbly or dry.  The sauce helped it a bit I think, as the two flavors work well together.  I would buy this again.  Probably the best I've had in my limited experience.  Da Sauce - Not bad at all.  In fact I prefer this over a lot of Famous Dave's sauces.  It has a tang to it, but not overpowering with it.  Its not a thick sauce.  It seems to not fit their ribs the best, though...its hard to explain.  Kind of a moppy sauce, but perhaps better on someone else's ribs.  Even still, I wouldn't mind having a bottle of it at home for my chicken or burgers.  Good stuff.  So yeah, this is a great place to come for some Chi-Town goodies.  They get the Italian Beef right, the taste of the Maxwell correct, and they also have some other good stuff I have to back and try.  I also gotta try their fried catfish - in fact, they have an all you can eat fish fry on Fridays.    Pricing was normal for this kind of food - about $7 for the sandwiches, $4 for the Maxwell, $16 for the 2 meat combo w/sides.  Not bad.  Service the second time was nice - a very personable and chatty lady was behind the counter and we had some nice conversation...very kind to replace my red beans and rice after i dropped it by saying good bye haha.  I recommend the place and i'm sure I'll increase the rating as I go back more.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I got food from here for the first time today. We got ribs, a pulled pork sandwich, a Chicago dog, and the Polish dog.  We also purchased sides of macaroni salad, BBQ beans, corn, and fried zucchini.  The ribs:                 These were very very dry and rubbery. The BBQ on it tasted like we were eating the ashes of a bonfire pit. There was way too much liquid smoke in the BBQ, unfortunately lingering forever in our mouths....even after a couple of glasses of whiskey.  The pulled pork:                   This was no better. The pork was not mixed with the BBQ like pulled pork normally is. The bottom of my bun was so soggy that it basically turned back into dough. The BBQ sauce itself was also not up to par, it didn't taste like a bonfire, but there was definitely not enough on the sandwich and it was really bland to almost the point of no taste.  The sides:                  The macaroni salad was dry as hell and the noodles were not cooked all the way. There was hardly any dressing on it and it looked like it had been sitting around for a couple days.                     The fried zucchini looked good from the outside until you bit into it. It was straight mush- like it had been squeezed to a pulp.                    The corn was also disgusting. It was definitely in a steamer (or pot of water) for way too long. Like the zucchini, the corn kernels were mushy.                     The BBQ beans were the only good factor of our meal. The BBQ sauce could have used a little more in spices and herbs- but it was good.  The dogs:                    Have not eaten these yet. But how can you mess up a hot dog? But from what we have had so far, who knows?                    Read the reviews prior to visiting the restaurant and gave them the benefit of the doubt.  However, as a cook for 7 years, you can take it from me that this place is not worth the money.",

We had a simple rib tip and it is definitely first choice for the next visit. I also am going to make sure to save room for dessert. Homemade peach cobbler!  Billie was working the counter, & I think I may have met a long lost family member. She was so much fun and so welcoming.",

If you love a little kick in flavor this is the place for you. Most barbecue spots just smoke their sausages but Tom's takes it to another level by searing the sausage to give a little crunch.  Different textures can bring a whole new element in a food that you may eat often.  Can't wait to try other menu items.  I would have posted a pic but the food was gone when I thought about it, hahaha.",

With a menu featuring a wide range of Chicago style barbecue down to the traditional basics, every dish is hand crafted with love that you can taste in every tender bite. This location features a staff that is just as sweet as their house sauce, with people like Billi that truly enrich the experience and show and make you feel that they care about you and your dining experience. Thank you Tom's, I look forward to many delicious meals to come.",

I'm from Kansas City so I love my BBQ, the day we went I had the #3 Italian beef sandwich and I'd have to say it was the best I've ever had (my lips were tingling in a good way). This place is a must and Billie was the most amazing host. Will be returning soon! Location on baseline & mill ave in Tempe.",

Although the staff is very nice, the bbq chicken was AWFUL, it was compressed chicken or at least tasted like rubber and like it came out of a can, it had fat in it. Yuk!  I didn't return it and didn't ask for my $$ back, but rather took the untouched part to someone who was hungry on the street -- I know that sounds bad but I hate to have food thrown away when someone else may love it and by some of the other reviews, it looks like that's the case.  The sauce was also awful (in my books) and the fries were limp and greasy.  We like to shop locally, but this place needs to step it up to get 5 stars.    Oh also the ladies room had a bad sewer smell.   We definitely will not go back.",

However, it seemed like it was a bit over priced for the quality. It was obvious his pulled pork had been sitting in a warmer for a few hours. The curly fries were undercooked and too greasy. The mushrooms my boyfriend ordered were not impressive either. Good potential but not quite on the mark.",

The brisket taste like it came right off the grill, and the BBQ sauce was complete heaven. Now the brisket taste like I microwaved it the day after I bought it. I can't really pinpoint when this happened, but it felt like a downward progression over time. It's been almost five years of eating here, and I go less and less each year.   Hopefully they can regather whatever it was that made them seem special to me years ago. I would really like to eat the BBQ I remember when I originally found this place after a long days work.

It was tossed between a hamburger bun and drenched in sauce that turned this into a knife and fork event. Too bad that the chicken was cold and so were the baked beans. I really did not want to come back and microwave fresh food, but that was the case at Tom's. The chicken was smoked, but it tasted like smoke, no other seasonings or anything going on here. The Baked Beans are still good, but this visit proved that Tom's need a bit of a lesson  in serving hot food and food that is a value. At 6 bucks, it seems like a good deal for sandwich, but it wasn't.",

I can almost guarantee this meat has never seen the inside of a smoker. The taste is chemical, as if they were using liquid smoke rather than bothering with the real thing. The chicken has a texture that suggests it was boiled.   It bears mentioning that I also tasted the pulled pork. It was extremely salty, acidic, and tasted like it should have been thrown out yesterday.   Furthermore, the sauce tastes like they picked it up at Costco. It's so sweet it's cloying, and it's just dumped on top of the already cooked meat. True barbecue has the sauce cooked on. This place does barbecue a great disservice.",
