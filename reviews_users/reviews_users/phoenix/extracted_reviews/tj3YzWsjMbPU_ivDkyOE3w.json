We had a couple of unusual choices, the vegan spinach and mushroom scramble with sweet potato hash browns, and a breakfast pizza. Both were surprisingly good. I suggest trying items you haven't had before, although our friend said her eggs benedict (a more typical choice) was excellent, too. Our only complaint is that since there are no \"soft\" finishes (like carpet, drapes, acoustic ceilings) the place gets a bit loud when it's busy.",

Nice fast casual approach to breakfast. Order at the counter, display your number and amazing breakfast in minutes. Boom, can't get much easier than that.  The space is open, vibrant and radiating with good energy. Creative copy is displayed all over the walls adding fun character to the dining area. Staff was nice and unobtrusive, yet readily available to serve you. Perfect.  So, how about the food? I ordered the Sante Fe Benedict. Such a fresh approach to a traditional breakfast item. It's everything you'd expect from a Benny, but with jalapeno corn bread and Chipotle Hollandaise. Best breakfast in a long time with a unique execution.   Scramble deserves your attention.",

The atmosphere is very friendly, bright and happy with a great modern flare.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful which is a huge plus at a quick order kind of restaurant.  I love their menu options since they have so many vegan dishes and you can do anything with egg whites.  It feels like it could be a healthy breakfast option.  You order at the counter and then they bring your food in a few minutes.  **free coffee for yelp members who check in!!**  They have soy milk for the coffee and even flavored creamers too!  I could sit there all day and drink coffee with that selection.   For the food... I had egg whites scrambled with spinach, mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes.  I subbed sweet potato hash for the hash browns which was a great choice.  The hash browns looked average and not worth the splurge.    I am excited to go back to try their lunch menu!

    "text": "I love coming to scramble, and it's a definite go to when I don't want to wait too long at all.  I enjoy their breakfast wraps, the eggs are scrambled well and the portions are good too. Not too small not huge. I like the lunch wraps and the soups are pretty tasty, though I do add stuff to the wraps to add a bit more of what I like for example avocado which is an up charge of .75 cents which is pretty cheap, however I was kinda bummed they charged for the tomatoes. This is the first time I actually investigated the receipt because of the review, but I never feel the bill is ever too pricey and I'll always order whatever I want.   I tried a smoothie today and I like it a lot. There's no weird aftertaste to it and the consistency is really creamy I got the mango and did banana with it instead of the mango/banana that's on the menu. 20 oz for $5 not bad. I shared it bc I'm not a huge sweets girl anyway.   I sit outside when I can as long as the suns out. Also they often have heaters outside when it's really chilly, however at that point I'm staying inside.  Overall the staff is awesome they go above and beyond when they can and they're all always running around hard at work. I love the order and sit concept. You essentially have 5 servers because anyone working on the floor is willing to act as such. THIS MEANS TIP THEM !! The staff is also aware of their regulars , I appreciate that attention to detail.   Thank you scramble for being, fast, easy, friendly, and delicious !!",

Asked for avocado instead of ham in the western omelette -girl says it will be .99 extra, I say ok can we sub it for ham? She says it will still be .99- ok whatever. I get my omelette- no avocado and so I ask for some on the side since it's not in my omelette... to the same girl, she says oh you asked for ham to be subbed- I'm like what? It already comes with ham, and I was charged for extra ham. Makes no sense, I did get my avocado for no charge but was charged 2.40 for extra ham.... -____- oh and the \"caramelized onions\" are definitely not caramelized, just ordinary onions. I get the cool appeal and it has options for vegans but I won't be back here.",

    "text": "I would give this place less than one star if I could. I guess they are trying but come on..I was in Scottsdale I was expecting to have better quality food than that. I would have rather gone anywhere else than here honestly. When you tell someone to substitute egg for vegetables don't you think they'd just put more veggies? No since i substituted tofu for veggies instead they said they'd put way more avocado? Lol idk what sense that makes..but anyways they put like one little slice off half an avocado side..I could have ate a full avocado at home and felt more satisfied than the whole meal they gave me. It was tinier than you'd give a child. The whole burrito I mean. Just a waste of money. I left feeling unsatisfied with  my meal and like I didn't even eat at all. That same amount of money could have been spent at chipotle with a bowl..that would have been way better worth my money and I don't even like buying that lol..I just wouldn't go here if you're vegan at all. Don't even try it. Run away. Meat and chicken period eaters must love it for it to stay in business. Or maybe they just don't like vegans and gave me a shitty breakfast burrito lol",

    "text": "About us:  My husband and I live in Scottsdale and go out to breakfast once every weekend.  I try to pick a different place each time because I'm adventurous and we haven't yet found a place to become a regular favorite.    This review is for the:  Scottsdale Road Scrambles location (September 2014).  Summary:  Atmosphere lacking for me, but food good.  A little spendy for what it is.  Fast, friendly service.  The atmosphere:  This is almost a cafeteria-style eatery.  The space is small, but bright with lots of windows and high ceilings; very open and also industrial (metal decor) and modern despite the wood laminate flooring.  Not a lot of personal, freestyle seating - there are bench seats and tables largely lining walls and partitions; you can easily get friendly with other parties seated next to you.  It's upbeat, noisy and active.    While none of that's bad, it's not what I like in a breakfast or dinner place - that really only works for me for lunch.  My preference for breakfast is somewhere comfortable and warm to ease into the day where the noise level is low, music is soothing, but happy, and where my husband and I can keep to ourselves enjoying coffee and food.  The process:  You need to check the menu, first, before ordering.  Then, you get in line and order at the front counter and pay beforehand like at a buffet, but with ordering from a menu instead of buffet.  Then, take your number, stop by at the beverage section to grab your coffee or whatever drink, and find your place to sit.  Someone will bring your food soon.    The food:  The food is just fine.  Cooked right, tastes good, no complaints, but definitely not a place comfortable enough for me to want to linger; more of \"please bring my food so I can eat and get the hell out of this chaos\" kind of place to me.  Now, there is some outdoor seating, that I'm assuming is quieter, but not sure, but when we went, it was too hot outside to try it (hello, Arizona, it's too hot most of the year to be outside).    End result:  I won't be going back unless I'm hanging out with someone who really wants to go there.  As a personal choice, it's a no.",

    "text": "We live in the area of the Scramble Scottsdale location, so we decided that we wanted to support local business and tried it.  We ordered omelets, and we order omelets at various area restaurants.  I will have to say that for a three egg omelet it was the smallest that we have ever had anywhere.  So now, we wait on ourselves, get our own coffee, water, silverware, napkins, etc and we are served this omelet that must be made from robin's eggs, it is sooooo small!!  The hash browns were the greasiest mess of potatoes that I have every seen.  We asked for the toast to be buttered in the kitchen (one small bit of service, please!) and it came out of the kitchen with no butter on it, and frozen butter to try and spread on it.    The server explained to us that they do not used cracked eggs for their omelets and scrambled eggs, but buy it by the container - YUCK!  The place looks very clean.  However, while we were there two employees  came out of the kitchen (must be the cooks) and they were the filthiest human beings that I have seen except for someone holding signs along the freeway.  This was at 6:00AM!  I hate to think of how dirty they would be after they cooked all day.  Bottom line.............if you are going to try to compete with breakfast restaurants in Scottsdale and be self-service you'd better have a whopping good, breakfast with HUGE portions.  By the way, the smallest omelet (theirs!) is also the most expensive in Scottsdale.  And..............clean up your cooks before the Health Department makes you clean them up!",

I also ordered a side of bacon, and only got 2 burnt pieces for $3.69! WTF!! What a rip! We're used to ordering a side of bacon and at least get 3 or 4 decent pieces.

(Side note: I love that the patio is dog friendly too and they have water bowls available.)  My fiance got the Morning Scramble and I got the Two Egg breakfast. Mine came with toast, hash browns, and bacon/sausage. The Morning Scramble was kind of spicy but it had a great taste to it as well. We also got a cinnamon roll to share and it was delicious! The staff was very friendly even though it was really busy. Prices are very reasonable too-- our total was $28. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Scramble is a locally-owned, small chain of quick and casual breakfast/lunch spots that prides itself on serving as many locally sourced ingredients (aka Farm-to-Fork) as possible. However they go about it, there's one thing that always goes into everything they do here, and that my friends is Quality--with a capital Q! This was not my first visit to Scramble, as I visited their Phoenix location on my previous AZ trip and loved it just as much. This particular visit was on Thanksgiving morning, and the reason I knew they were open was I had messaged the business the day before on my trusty Yelp app and received a confirmation from Scramble MGMT within a few minutes--now that's service!   Santa Fe Benedict- If perfectly cooked Eggs and Ham served on top of a sweet and spicy Jalapeno Cornbread and topped off with a creamy Chipotle Hollandaise Sauce doesn't get your mouth watering, then maybe you should check your pulse. I rarely do breakfast these day, but when I do I usually go for the Benedicts, and Scramble's Santa Fe is about as good as it gets. The uniqueness of this dish is only topped by its taste as the creamy eggs and sauce mix with the salty and sweet ham and spicy cornbread to make your tongue play Beethoven's 5th repeatedly.   Coffee & Salsa Bar- Special big-ups for their fully-stocked condiment and coffee bar. While their coffee is merely passable, all the accoutrements to make your cup perfect are right there. Their Salsa selection is also pretty amazing, as they have your ubiquitous Sriracha and Tabasco--plus **FIVE** flavors of Cholula! As a certified Pepper Head who always needs to kick things up a notch, this really brought figurative --and literal!-- tears of joy to my eyes.   Service & Ambiance- Despite it being Thanksgiving morning all the employees were very friendly and efficient. I really like their pay beforehand system, which is the exact opposite of most breakfast places. Scramble's decor is very modern and sterile looking with lots of stainless steel accents. While not my favorite decor, it kinda fits Scramble's theme of fast, fresh and efficient. There are multiple TVs throughout showing everything from SportsCenter to a variety of local and national News outlets.   Value- Scramble provides an eggcellent value for the quality and quantity of which you're being served. With most meals below $10 and kid's meals at only $3.99 this is a great place to take your family without breaking the bank.  If you're looking for a quick, delicious, (semi)healthy, Quality and value-priced breakfast, or lunch, then look no further than Scramble. Highly recommended.",

I have not had eggs Benedict in years so it was great to be able to have it. The only thing that could've made it better is if they would've used a gluten free English muffin instead of gluten free toast.

Now as far as the food is concerned, the portions are not equivalent to the price you pay and the taste is very poor. Hash browns are over seasoned with pepper and the meatlovers hardly has any meat in it and is virtually tasteless.

    "text": "I am coming to the conclusion that Scottsdale-ians just do NOT approve of a big breakfast. Everyone here must eat smoothies and fruit salads for breakfast, because it is VERY difficult to find a good bacon and eggs with some hashrbowns around this town.   Scramble had a big menu, so while I only gave it 3 stars, I would definitely go back and try something else if I lived here. being just a spring training traveler, I am not so sure.   Pet Peeve: Butter my toast!   The place was super clean, really nice looking - I would have to try a BRIZZA if I lived nearby! haha",

My wife being vegan everywhere we go I get to try the vegan option and they're excellent at scramble.    Also their egg cook must have been hatched himself; he cooks basted eggs like Elvis ruled rock n roll.   My kids just love the Brizzas.  What kid doesn't like pizza? It's like the best of both worlds pizza and breakfast - get outta here awesome.   Also their servers and cashiers are always quick and helpful.  I've never had less than excellent service in my 30 plus times going to scramble (at either location for that matter).    For all the snobby A-holes in Scottsdale that want to have their hand held and want to piss and moan about ingredients I don't know how Scramble isn't at the top,of their list.  Everything is fresh and Local.  Their eggs come from the farm same or next day.    I tried butterfields and butters and us egg and I just don't like them nearly as well.  Not as fresh, not as hip, not as nice of people.    Hands down the breakfast spot in Scottsdale for anyone that likes casual, delicious, dog friendly, courteous, fresh, and local it's Scramble.  Do your research you won't find fresher ingredients or nicer folks.    Oh and The patio is perfect for Scottsdale.    I've worked in restaurants and restaurant management for over 20 years and these guys are doing it right, paying it forward and it's paying off.    And if you are one of the people that doesn't like it - good go to Denny's enjoy a grand slam =/",

We especially liked the coffee/spice bar in the middle of the room (they have Cholula!). The only thing that could be added to it is a cinnamon shaker. Great place!  We will be back!",

You order at the counter, seat yourself, and food is delivered when it's ready by truly excellent (and caring!) staff. They make sure your food is right and you're happy with everything. No False pretenses here. Just plain good food, and a great ambiance.   Super diverse crowd and really kid-friendly. They hand out WikiSticks to young patrons to keep them interested and occupied while you wait. No need to hand that kid a phone or iPad here!  When we came to eat, there was a soccer family at one table, a group of bikers at another, several young families with foodie kids, and a couple of twosomes just there to enjoy a good meal. I loved the eclectic mix of people!  The huevos rancheros was delish. So fresh and a great combination of flavors without any one element overpowering the dish. We also enjoyed a Southwest Burrito which was tasty and like a party in your mouth with only the freshest ingredients invited!  Just go. Trust me.",

Kinda pricey for sure.   My son  got a turkey wrap requested no romaine lettuce, but it came with iceberg. Husband and I got a cup of tortilla chicken soup.  We ask if it was made with white meat chicken, cashier said yes.  Well... The soup had dark meat!    I got a side of the breakfast turkey sausage; again I asked if it was good to the cashier.... Her response.... \"I don't know, I'm a vegetarian\".  I got it anyways, and so disappointed in both soup and breakfast sausage.  \"Cup\" of soup was measured as a CUP!    Sausage was cold.    My husband went and quietly spoke to the manager regarding this.  And she had nothing to say but sorry.     Not going back.",

Came out wrong the first time so I asked for it to be made as asked the previous time. They gave me a look and remade it, giving the impression that I was the one who made the mistake. It came out the second time and it did look good. I started eating it, and noticed the quality of the chicken was so bad. Honestly i didn't even want to eat it. I walked up to the front to ask for a to-go box. When I got up, the woman at the smoothie bar quickly said \"what, you didn't like your bacon?\". This was exceptionally rude and I responded \" can I please have a to-go box\" and walked off.   I would not recommend this place. The staff just makes it feel so uncomfortable. Specifically the girl at the smoothie bar at 11am on May 29 needs to be let go.",

It's little things like homemade jams vs cheap Welches Jam packs or a nice artesian bread for toast, not using slices from Frys brand.  Maybe invest in a juicer..the front is lined with what you would think is freshly juiced OJ but it's juice from a gallon jug poured into cups.

Biscuits and gravy were great too! They have a full bar and the patio is dog friendly  --- check it out, you wont regret it.

It is also a good place to talk with friends over brunch because as weird as it may sound, the sound in the restaurant doesn't carry very far.  However, the prices seem pretty ridiculous at times. I've experienced fairly good food here, but I don't want to keep having to pay $10 for breakfast-that's dinner pricing!

Apple Cider dressing was delish and mellowed the kale out. It also had dried cranberries and parm cheese. Quinoa and sunflower seeds added a nice crunch! I did add chicken to the salad. People are so friendly there. Great customer service! Like that Scramble does special events like Painting Nights, Cooking classes with local az companies and I heard they do Breakfast for Dinner events to give back to the community. PS this location has adult beverages. Yass!",

Seems simple, however you'll be amazed at how uncommon it is to find turkey bacon in a world filled with a bacon obsession!   It's a little bit of a different dining format, but seems to work pretty well. You enter through the doors and are greeted with sleek screens that display the menu, as you wait in line to order from the counter. Once you order, you're given a table number and your beverage then off to pick an open table (note: it will be busy anytime before 2pm on the weekend, much like everyone else in this city), but I've never not been able to find a table. Chairs are a little uncomfortable... You know... That trendy, aluminum, \"repurposed/green\" lawn chair type of chair. Nothing that will ruin breakfast, just leave with with some super awesome indents in your legs for a good 15 minutes.   There are a good amount of TVs in the place, and they usually have some sort of game playing -- they are soccer friendly -- so you can watch some champions league while chowing down.  Dishes I recommend: Gringo Burrito, French Toast, and the Huevos Rancheros, and of course, a soy latte ;)",

I am sure I will be back for some more.  Parking in the area is tight if you are going to stay longer than 30 minutes.  I am not sure what they will do once other restaurants open.

We ordered all vegan and/or vegetarian items during our visit, and even talked to the front staff about how impressed we were with the vegan options they had. Yet our daughter's French Toast was served tasting like sausage for some reason. I'm guessing they accidentally put a side of sausage on the plate and switched it out before giving it to us? Not sure, but obviously that was gross.  Scramble has gluten-free options as well but they're almost all meat options, which is all naturally gluten-free anyway. If you're going to boast about your gluten-free options, you should have something special that's GF not just stuff everyone else has. GF French Toast would have been awesome.  My coffee was served hot when I ordered it iced, and our eggs weren't cooked properly (the whites were even runny-ish), and while the manager did notice and apologize, we weren't offered any type of credit, coupon, refund, or anything else really.",

When you walk in the menus are to the left and you order upfront and they give you a number and you can basically sit anywhere you like (personally I like that idea better than having a host seating me).   I order the western omelette and my friend order their original eggs benedict. First off, the omelette was just not that great... Eggs tasted a little over cook and processed. My food was not hot either. The eggs benedict was alright. It wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it all the time if I was a regular. Hash brown was good and crunchy. Toasts was very hard chewy...   I don't know what happen that day but I didn't like the food at all that day... I would definitely come back and try their other dishes but I probably won't come back for awhile..",

    "text": "I was drawn to this place because of their vegan options. I usually go to a vegan restaurant downtown for their vegan food, but since Scramble is so much closer to where I live, I decided to try this place out. I ordered their vegan French toast and substituted the sweet potato hash for regular hash browns and I ordered a mimosa. Because I checked in on Yelp, I was given a free coffee with my breakfast too. I was pleasantly surprised to see they had the traditional milk options as well as soy milk for my coffee. There are very few restaurants that I know that offer soy milk.  The vegan French toast was delicious. The only problem I had was that the pieces were difficult to cut because the bread was very thick. The portion size was huge. I ate half of the hash browns and only one piece of the vegan French toast. They'll make good leftovers.   The parking lot was jam packed when I arrived at 10 am and the place was pretty busy.   I'd go back there for their vegan food. :) Thanks Scramble.",

Not situated in the most happening area in the city if you're looking for more of a lively scene.   Ok now to eats. I'm a coffee snob and here you get below average drip coffee. To compliment our coffee we got their special - a warm blueberry muffin which was pretty delicious. Citrus glaze on top with fresh blueberries in the middle, plus some blueberry jam... yum yum! We kept it simple with breakfast items - eggs, hash browns, toast and sausage. Can't go wrong with that, pretty good! Hash browns were super greasy but crunchy on top, that's what makes it taste good I guess! I kinda wish I ordered the pancakes. Was eyeing the table next to me and the looked fluffy and scrumptious. On my next visit!   Overall nice, casual spot for a decent breakfast. You'll order what you want at the counter, sit where you want, inside or out, and they'll bring your food to enjoy!",

But instead they move tables for auction items, encourage donations and overall are wonderful.  AND THE FOOD IS GREAT!",

(wish there was a bit more to choose from though) Today I ordered the vegan veggie scramble with a side of sweet potato hash and sourdough bread. The veggie scramble was actually pretty tasty and I added some siracha on top to give it a bit more spice! The sweet potato hash was nice as well but I'm not a huge sweet potato fan, if you are this is definitely for you! I also really enjoyed the sourdough bread. I added some vegan butter on top that came with the meal (smart balance buttery spread) and was really pleased with the taste! Pro tip: add the scramble onto the toast for extra yum! Overall if you're a vegan and going to get brekkie with an omnivore, this is a nice place to go.",

I literally get cravings for a sweet potato and end up just going for breakfast to have the sweet potato hash. Growing up I never liked French toast because it was excessively eggy and I hated that. Now that I'm vegan I've realized the Foods way better. For example the vegan French toast is what I picture when I think of French toast and there's no weird \"egg\" substance surrounding the bread. The Foods really fresh and the service is good. The parking lot is small though, so beware! But overall worth a trip, plus there's a lot more options on the menu to try.",

    "text": "I was staying at the Scottsdale Plaza for a couple days prior to a work conference and after a rough Saturday night out til 2am but still on 4am NY time bar-hopping after front row seats to the Jim Jefferies Comedy show - I was looking for a brunchy spot to soak up the alcohol in my belly.  I stumbled up on Scramble being a quarter mile from the hotel and what a treat.  I got there at a time with only one person in front of me one line - I saw that quickly can change and by the time I sat down the line was to the door.  The cutest and friendliest of hostesses dealt with my \"traveling indecisiveness\" - see I love coming to places and not trying what I know I will like - since I pretty much like everything - but instead I like recommendations and things that the place is known for.  The young woman walked me through the menu and told me about their trademark breakfast pizza - the BRIZZA - known for absorbing alcohol in the belly.  But she had already sold me on a green Chile pork burrito so I was caught in my decision.  Easy enough - I came back the second day for the burrito and had two amazing meals.  Coffee was outstanding as well at this \"serve yourself\" center bar.  I love that they serve adult beverages like bloody Mary's and mimosas as well.  I highly recommend this place.  Food is served quickly and while not a traditional \"service at your table\" spot - the service is actually top notch and is what will distinguish this spot from it's peers in addition to their high quality brunch fare.",

Says a lot about ownership in finding well meaning and bright people who really do care. After all, these people truly imprint one's 1st impression.  We are kind of special request consumers and the Scramblians have been up to the task.  Amanda is over the top gracious, caring and a wonderful staffer.  A REAL keeper. I believe the young and dapper gent with glasses (Conner?) is also up for the task.  A very good guy.  Menu is fun, creative and inspiring.  I believe the back of the house efforts could be fine tuned, yet this is that work in progress setting and we believe they will succeed mightily.  Stay your course Scramble.",

    "text": "Helene, the charismatic, friendly, attentive young lady at the front is reason enough to come here.  She was super welcoming as she realized that we were first timers and didn't know the process.  The \"process\" is to read the menu on the wall, place your order, take the number they give you to attach to the stand on your table, and wait for them to bring the food.  Easy enough.   Got the traditional eggs benedict with extra crispy hash browns.  My companion got the lox and bagel with capers/tomatoes.  Both were large portions.  I found the hash browns to be a little on the greasy side.  Too much butter or oil or whatever it was.  They had a lovely taste but my brain was ticking away the number of calories so I didn't finish it.  The eggs in the benedict were perfectly poached although the hollandaise sauce need a little more acid--meaning lemon.  The lox tasted good, not salty as some lox can be.  The tomatoes were a little on the hard side--- you know as when they are forced to ripen.   I did a Yelp check-in which yielded me a free coffee.  Yay! The environment was clean and welcoming, lots of choices on the menu, servers super nice and pricing very fair.  Definitely a breakfast destination if you are in the area.",

I've ordered both of these plates at other Scramble establishments and have felt the portions to be a fair mix of tofu to veggies or soyrizo. Both of our plates were lacking the star ingredients at this location. I'm confused as to how they justify the cost of the plate to the ratio of veggies they add to each plate. As vegans veggies are where we seek for our nourishment. Although they made up for it in taste I was very much missing the vegetables noted on the menu. I'm not saying they didnt add any but I could count the teeny bite size portions on both hands. My man's plate didn't have the signature hugh of reds from the soyrizo spices or the flavor. We ordered delivery so we weren't able to address this right away. Had we dined in best believe I would have said something. Closed mouths don't get fed and we paid to be fed. I really hope someone in management reviews these post in order to better serve their customers.",

First of us to order was fine, she got 2 eggs and toast. The other 2 of us was not as good. I had ordered the Tex Mex Benedict with an extra side of dollar cakes and my sister ordered the meat lovers scramble with a substitute of dollar cakes instead of toast. Again, first order was fine. Second order was mine. The food runner commented that one of my poached eggs fell off the muffin. I responded that she did that because the plate above had Hollandaise sauce underneath it. She says nothing and wipes my plate. The third order was for a mushroom bacon scramble. . . . Yup, my sister ordered meat lovers. She didn't complain because she was torn between those anyways. As I am eating, I notice my Benedict didn't have hash browns. Apparently the girl substituted my hash browns for the dollar cakes. It's fine. I probably didn't need it. What was interesting was that the cashier repeated everything back to us perfectly at the time of order. Food was overall average. I felt my pulled pork was too salty compared to how bland the hollandaise sauce was. Adult beverages for breakfast were very reasonably priced. The dollar cakes were probably the best part and maybe worth coming back for.",

    "text": "First time at Scramble. It is an order when you come in and then find a table. The service was good, many friendly young people. We liked the area where you get your own water and coffee. The Italian Roast coffee was good but was way too hot. After 15+ minutes, I had to put ice in the coffee to take my first drink.   I liked that they put turkey bacon in some of their offerings. I had a Brizza, it was good, plenty of avocado. My wife had a breakfast sandwich. She liked it but only gave it 3 to 4 stars. The blueberry muffin she had was quite enjoyable.   The biggest disappointment was the men's bathroom. It really needs to be checked more frequently and any broken fixtures also be repaired.",

I ordered the California Omelette (with turkey bacon, kale, jack cheese and topped with avocado) and it was just ok.  I struggled to find the cheese, and the omelette itself was thin and a bit sad looking.  It wasn't bad, it was just.....meh.  My coworkers each ordered burritos and had the same sort of reaction.  The elements were all there; it just didn't hold up to anything.  One of them said they'd rather have a fast food burrito over the one they had here, and they both said they'd rather pass on Scramble in the future.    Not sure if we just came on an off morning, since other reviewers seem to have had better experiences, but if what we had this morning was the standard, then I'll take a pass on Scramble in the future.",

    "text": "The counter-order Breakfast concept is pretty awesome.  One of two locations in the mid-section of the Valley.  Wasn't really sure of what to expect but I liked the prices posted on their online menu and when you're out of food but wanting a muscle-building breakfast this is a solid spot.  The parking lot was packed but when you find yourself inside there's plenty of space with the addition of the patio seating as well.  For $2.89 you have bottomless coffee: an Italian and Breakfast Roast.  Heinz apparently makes honey.    I ordered the steak and eggs, this is where I have some problems though.  Although the price for the dish is excellent and they should keep it right there with the perfect portion.  The NY Strip was probably one of the worst seasoned steaks I've ever eaten in my life.  So y'all need to put in some work on that.  Two fluffy eggs, perfect hashbrowns, and a English muffin to round it out.  My girlfriend went on to order the Phoenix omelette and my oh my was that delicious, I could only be jealous of her choice that was chock full of flavor versus my un-flavorful steak.  The sour dough bread is also delightful.  Definitely a fun choice for breakfast, especially if they get after it and season that steak.",

Daughter had the strawberry French toast she said it was just ok also. We have Had many great meals in Scottsdale. If you need a quick breakfast and don't mind spending $34 for an ok breakfast -a 2 egg breakfast, skinny meat scramble, and sub-par strawberry French toast go for it. Not my favorite breakfast.",

Really nice patio - it wasn't very busy when I went for brunch (around noon on a Saturday), but I've heard it gets packed earlier in the day. It's an order-at-the-counter type of a place, when I went it wasn't a long wait and our food was brought out relatively quickly.   I had the Southwest Burrito - a breakfast burrito with chorizo, cheddar, avocado, egg and jalapeno cream cheese. I'm also an avocado nut and it definitely could have used more avocado - it had a very small amount. It was good, a little heavier than I'm used to with the cream cheese and the tortilla was very buttery. I'm glad I don't know the calorie count or I probably wouldn't have eaten for the rest of the day.    A lot of the menu items are served with hash browns - they were ok, nothing amazing, but not bad. Overall a good experience here - I live in the neighborhood so I'm sure I'll be back.",

For example, we ordered a Cinnamon Bun that came with a glob of icing-- poor presentation.  The employees said the orange juice is freshly squeezed however it  was not!! The eggs also tasted like rubber.  My recommendation is to avoid this restaurant!!",

They somehow manage to cook eggs perfectly! They have a great menu, the place is nice and clean, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. We definitely look forward to coming back here next time we visit, if not again before the weekend's over!",

Now my fiance did not go to a \"traditional\" rival-type university so the welcome needless to say was....LESS THEN JOYFUL!!  \"Oh you guys are trash\" is how we were greeted & what actually came out of the mouth of what might have been the \"manager\" -- he was wearing a black logo polo (possible give away).....We haven't even had our coffee yet.  My fiance (being a spicey ITALIAN & again not having gone to a traditional rival type school was a bit bothered. I sat there & justified this mans behavior when in reality sometimes a greet or bash or whatever you want to call it could be poised differently. Perhaps, \"Good Morning GREAT GAME LAST YEAR...but this year you're going down\" or something other then \"OH YOURE TRASH\". At least let us have our coffee first lol",

We are very lucky our kids did not get sick...the did apologize and seemed very concerned about it which is good, but we will not be returning to this place, over priced and the food was not as amazing as we expected, Scottsdale seems to be a very \"uppity\" town and a lot of people seem to be a little stuck up and act like the food is off the charts...well news flash, it's not, ate in Scottsdale several times and the food is no different than a small town, actually smaller towns seem to have better food, I will stick to my smaller businesses in the future, thanks but no thanks to this place.",

I ordered the basic breakfast. Couldn't taste the rosemary in the hash browns. Eggs ok, but luke warm. Toast hard and unbuttered! Had to ask for butter. Not available at their self service station. Pancakes not hot. Butter wouldn't even melt on them. Artificial maple syrup. Prices high, service slow, noisy, food not hot and mediocre at best. Go to Butterfields or US Egg for sit down service and hot yummy food. Won't be back.",

It has clean looking and contemporary feel to it and I think it probably works great for the childless free wheeling set but the only thing kid friendly about his place is the quality precision made German high chairs that are stacked up in the corner. I think they have a market that they are successful in and they really set the place up to work for that.  Just didn't work for kids, and I have a few so perhaps I'm asking this place to be something it is not.  As far as the food goes most everyone was satisfied but the food lacked character.  My 19 year old loved the Sunrise Sandwich but that was the only really positive comment on the food. The only bright spot for this experience was the service.  Everyone in the place seemed genuinely happy to be there. They answered all of our questions completely and confidently knew the menu and really made us feel welcome.  I really want to know who staffed the place so I can hire them to run hr at my company.",

Though i doubt it'll maintain that sort of traffic once everyone's tried it a first time and i don't see this place as having too many regulars once the hype of the grand opening blows over. Its also somewhat expensive $$$ (we paid $30 for 2 people) so if you're footing the bill for more than just yourself be prepared to pay a decent amount of money for not that much food, food which i didnt find to be all that great in the first place. I ordered a large coffee drink and failed to realize until after i had paid that it cost $6 just for that (pretty sure i pay less at Starbucks for a similar type of drink). Also we waited a good 20/25 minutes to get our food once we ordered. None of it was worth it.  Personally i wouldn't recommend this place, i definitely won't be going there again (shame too because its literally right across the street from where i love) its all hype and to pricey for me for a Sunday breakfast.",

Ordering at a counter is always nice so that you are less likely to be waiting for a table and a server, and the food was decent, but didn't stand out to where I'd want to go back. Strawberry French toast was pretty good, but not the usual French toast consistency you would expect. Considering it was strawberry, I thought it was a little weak on that aspect and the cream was just ok. My girlfriend ordered chocolate chip pancakes, which turned out kind of rubbery and hard to cut. Bacon was good, hash browns were good, but the main courses weren't the standouts that they should have been. But the restaurant had a few TVs, all with different channels for guests to enjoy and the atmosphere was pretty relaxed. There are just better breakfast options in the area that I would choose over scramble, so hard to give it anything better than 3 stars.",

The veggie omelette was a good size for me, but may be a tad small for more aggressive eaters. The kids pancakes were super big... At 3.99 a great deal.   The food was a bit over saturated with butter from cooking, but I'm giving the kitchen staff a break with 4 stars as I know they will hit their rhythm soon and this place will be packed. With decent parking and a cool modern vibe I definitely recommend it.",

I usually do not take the time to go on Yelp and write a review but I had to this time as this place is expensive with terrible food/ service. We thought Scramble would be like Snooze for breakfast but wrong. Way over priced and sub par breakfast in ever-way...for 3 people almost $50 bucks...we could of gotten a better breakfast at iHop or Denny's for half the price. At least at Snooze you pay for the quality. Her are some example's ( seft service coffee $2.79, kids tiny bottle cholo milk $3.09, Western Omel $11.00, Meat Scramble $10.49 super tiny ) !   I would not recommend and would NEVER go back!",

You do order at the counter, and I got there early enough to not have to wait in line, but eventually one formed.  I can see that as being an issue.    I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and a side of bacon. The bacon was crispy and delicious. The hyevos were good.  There was a need for a little more spice though. I do like the crispy tortillas that added a great texture.  My counterpart had the Cuban sandwich. This was a bad choice.  Perhaps I've been to Miami too many times, but this was lacking in mustard big time.  The pork was crumbly and kept falling out. Eh.    This is a no frills, yet modern joint and it serves it purpose for breakfast, which I rather enjoyed.  they also serve limited alcohol which is great and the cost is reasonable.    They offer a nice patio for nicer days than it is right now and there are TVs inside.",

Hey, the concept is great, but some of the stuff served here reminded me of stuff I make on the weekends when I have time to cook.  Although they had a lot of seemingly tasty options, my huevos rancheros were nothing exciting.    My dish consisted of  blue corn & quinoa chips, spicy soyrizo, covered with 3 eggs, cheddar and seasoned black beans. I liked the pico de gallo, but I needed more spice.  My pal ordered a panini, while my other pal got an egg white omelet. All of us walked away yearning for more, but with hopes that it could be better.   Guess we will need to come back and try again. Based on my SF and Portland eats, this just didn't measure up.",

Chirizo was a bit grizzly and it was a bit scarce of cheese. My friend ordered the oatmeal and it looked good and she confirmed that it was, with pecans, raisins and brien sugar. The chairs were aluminum and not very comfortable. Very nice and bright and very breezy and cool...lots of doors. The cherry/acacia tea was the bomb! Went back maybe 47x lol...not really, but large, plastics cups were very small and I had to lol For the most part, cool, casual place.

    "text": "Scramble is one of the best brunch spots for vegans when dining with omnis (and meat lovers). The menu has a vegan section, and there's more offered than just a typical salad or basic scramble. I've had the vegan french toast before, but went for the vegan soyrizo burrito today. I also got a free cup of coffee from a Yelp check-in (yeay!).   There was a short line - not much of a wait at all - and plenty of tables. The coffee was great, and I loved the soy milk spout. Finally a place that doesn't charge extra for soy!!!   The burrito came out in a reasonable amount of time. It was huge - very overstuffed - and was served with a side of salsa and sweet potato hash. The burrito was great. I probably would have cooked the tofu a bit more, but it was fine as is. The soyrizo didn't overpower the flavor as it can in some breakfast scrambles. The salsa was just like I like it - finely chopped but not pure liquid. The burrito was so big I was able to bring half home for my husband, who fried up the tofu and ate it on toast. The sweet potato hash was a low point. It was just too greasy and not crispy even though I asked for it well done. I'd probably sub for regular hash browns next time, if they can be made vegan. I'm tempted to try the scramble on my next visit, but would need to find out if they have a vegan margarine for the toast (I'm fussy about wanting a buttery vegan spread on my toast if it's offered to vegans as a side).   This was my first visit to this location. We chose this one over the other option on Camelback thinking the parking would be better on a Sunday morning. Not so much. My friend had to valet and I parked in one of the spots reserved for a business that was closed for the day (bad me, but whatever). It is probably better on weekdays. I hope they continue to expand the vegan menu. Vegan blueberry pancakes would make me a regular!",

I really like how there is a separate portion of the menu dedicated to their vegan patrons. We ordered the vegans breakfast burrito and the vegan French toast. Both dishes were out of this world good. They came out hot and  in a timely manner. All the staff was friendly and helpful. Scramble has quite a large space inside and out and can certainly hold large groups no problem. We would definitely come back again if we happen to be in the Scottsdale area.",

I ordered the tofu soyrizo burrito.  It was less than average.  The sweet potato hash was cold and the texture and flavor was gross.  It looked like it had been sitting around on the counter for days and was not edible.  My husband had the vegan French toast.  It was average.    Went to get coffee and they didn't have any non dairy creamer out so my husband asked for a little bit of almond milk and they wanted to charge $1.00 for less than an ounce.  Ridiculous.  Spend $40 on two breakfast entrees and they couldn't give us a non-dairy creamer.    We won't be back.  You are better off avoiding this place and going to Snooze.",

My friend got an omelet and said it was delicious and I had the vegan french toast and it was hands down the best vegan breakfast food I've encountered. They have quite a few vegan friendly options which is great to see!   The prices were so reasonable and I felt I really got my money's worth with big serving sizes and quick service!

I loved it. It was big too! I couldn't finish the 2nd half. It came with sweet potato hash but was mixed with rosemary and it threw the whole thing off for me. I was hoping for something sweeter with maybe some pecans or something in it. It was not sweet and the rosemary overpowered it. I would definitely order the burrito again.  The lady ordered a veggie omelet with hash browns and it was well seasoned as well she said.   I topped my order off with a banana and peach smoothie w/ soy milk. It was bomb! I will definitely come back if I'm in the AZ area.",

Idk how this has 4 stars but y'all need to step your game up. I gave you two because at least I was able to consume it but I'm also a trash panda ( which should tell you a lot ) doesn't take much to satisfy me.

    "text": "Operations and management are horrible.   The food is good. That's why I gave them two stars.   The three missing stars is for management and operations. Total absolute shit show.   My fault and my fault only that I continue to go back. I've ordered breakfast  three times before work. You'd think I'd learn my lesson but I haven't. I order breakfast because scramble food is good and location is convenient.. it's on my way to work.  Each time I've been late to work by 8 mins and it's not that I'm late because the food isn't ready, it's because management and operations for takeout SUCK. it's a nightmare.   There's a takeout register but no one is ever there to help you. Management sees me waiting and employees walk right by me but they don't seem to care. Trust me it's not even that it's busy so they can't help you. I've worked in the serving industry for many years so it's even more frustrating when I see that it's not busy and not one person offers to help. After 10 minutes of patiently waiting like an idiot, I asked the girl on the next register helping take orders if I could call back and pay over the phone. She replies \"no, she can help you\" the girl standing right behind her polishing coffee mugs (The same employee that walked by me multiple times and didn't once bother to offer to help me). She puts down the coffee mug and checks me out. SHOOT ME.  So pissed. Late to work for the third time. I'm done ordering breakfast from here during the week.   Now on weekends the phones don't work in the morning. Ordering online is not available and UBER eats and Postmates are also unavailable. You can't order breakfast from here unless you are physically there because operations don't work. This place is a joke.   Again food is good but they need to fix their operations. How can you be so successful when certain operations are a huge fail?   Well, Here's my review and I hope this location takes into consideration to fix it.   Thank you,  Emily.",

    "text": "BACKGROUND   I first heard about Scramble from Uber Eats when I was over at my friend, Whitney's house, and we wanted brunch, but were too lazy to go out.  I got their Huckleberry Stuffed French Toast delivered, which is stuffed with white chocolate cream cheese filling.  It was so outrageously great, I wanted to check out where the deliciousness came from, so the last time I was at Whitney's, I popped over to Scramble to check it out.   SCRAMBLE  Scramble is owned by Clay Moizo and Don Talbot of Icon Hospitality Group, which also runs Half Moon Sports Grill.  Scramble's concept is fresh, customer and community friendly local food, and they are proud members of Local Fresh Arizona.  Scramble serves a wide variety of original breakfast and lunch, and also offers a selection of vegan and gluten friendly options too.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE   Scramble is in a cool neighborhood, but I was not thrilled by their choice of strip malls. In fact, I thought so highly about what I had read about the place, that I passed it by the first time, thinking it would be more impressive.  Once inside, I totally got their vibe, but I kind of thought I was a little too old for the place at first, mostly because the decor was cafeteria-patio furniture-y and it reminded me of a college hangout.  The setup is order at the cashier, and they give you a number, and bring the food over when it's ready.  Although they bring out your food, there is a self-serve bar that has a lot of condiments and such. So, when she brought over my food, I asked for some things, and she pointed to the self-serve bar. It's self-serve, then waitress-y, then self-serve. I was up, then down, then up again.  The staff was super helpful, and very friendly.   I loved the Huckleberry Stuffed French Toast so much the first time from Uber them again, only this time with a mimosa. The food is SCRUMPTIOUS.  CONCLUSION  Scramble has great food in a casual semi-self-serve atmosphere. I'll definitely come back.  4/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *There are 3 locations: Scottsdale, Phoenix, and Biltmore Area, with one coming in Chandler.  *Plenty of parking out front.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fazscramble.com&s=c521a311e7a844fdc10dab0289856534d27db8b0c5825bd6876ace6c4fc8d60f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">azscramble.com</a>",

There is only one bathroom for each gender and so it made it very inconvenient to go to the bathroom or wash my hands. The environment gets rather busy and can be somewhat loud. Pricing is a little on the high side in my opinion, $11 for my scramble.",

I am a tofu fangirl so decided I wanted to go for a vegan dish so I ordered a Vegan Soyrizo Burrito. It was quickly brought to our table. Was not to aesthetically pleasing, but I did not want to judge my food like that! Unfortunately my looks were not deceiving me and that was the nastiest bite of a burrito I have ever experienced. It was like pure flavorless mush with like 2 pieces of avocado. And unfortunately the sweet potato hash was pretty unsatisfying as well.  My date urged me to go tell them my issue and I worked up the courage to tell them I needed to order something else haha. They were extremely kind and accommodating, didn't even charge me for the second meal I ordered. I got The Alma Brizza and it was much better. Still not amazing, a little too salty for some reason, but I did like it, was a unique dish. My date got the Meat Lovers Scramble and he seemed to enjoy it. So overall, food is meh, service and atmosphere is very good!",

I always love to find new breakfast & brunch places to check out so I decided to stop by Scramble. After looking through the expansive menu, I was happy to discover that they offer several gluten-free options! I usually tend to get the basic 2 eggs, any way until discovering they had a breakfast pizza--that was offered on a gluten-free base. I think it was the breakfast God's telling me to try something new!   I got the Chicago style Brizza--eggs, sausage, hash browns, Monterrey jack & cheddar. It's a pretty big size to share for only $10. I thought it was an innovative way to serve up classic breakfast food in a unique way. The Brizza was absolutely delicious and tasted so fresh. I have to say I'm a huge fan now! If you go in, please give one of the Brizza's a try!   Scramble is not only innovative in their food, but also the way they adapt to modern needs. There is complimentary WiFi, charging stations, and online ordering which makes it a convenient stop on your way to work or even do your work there! In the future, I hope they expand their milk alternatives for coffee and smoothies. The only non-dairy option is soy. And perhaps get some gluten-free pancakes on the menu!  Overall, I had such a wonderful experience and I can tell that Scramble is the type of place that constantly strives for improvement to cater to all. I can't wait to visit again and get another Brizza!",

If I wanted to pay this price I would rather go to a full service brunch place that serves alcohol etc. so was a little caught off guard. Maybe their food is amazing?! Well my omelet tasted burnt and no amount of salsa or hot sauce could mask it. Hash browns were ok. Crispy but you can tell they just drenched it in butter...   N my husband didn't think his burrito was good. He got egg whites and he told me it wasn't cooked all the way through. He could have gotten a breakfast burrito at a golf course for $5 that tastes just as good or better...   And lastly, it took waaaay too long for our food to come out. I say 25 - 30 min..  BUT the girl working the register was super polite and had a great attitude. And so did the other workers. They were on top of it, cleaning, bussing tables etc.   Overall, I don't kno if the kitchen was having an off day or something but I was a little disappointed.",

It took us about 10 minutes to figure out what we wanted. Being gluten free is not an easy task to find sensitive restaurants.  We noticed this wonderful person(Miranda) training and thought to ourselves now that's a great manager.  Our food was great and as we were finishing our breakfast Miranda came out and made the rounds of the dining room to see if everything was ok and to schmooze a little with us. We told her that we wish we had a Scramble in our town.  Scramble is our new favorite breakfast place. Miranda is pretty awesome too.!!!!",

Staff is so super friendly! I got a very standard breakfast both of my visits.... eggs were cooked perfectly to order, everything was timely and served hot! The restaurant is super sunny and clean... mimosas are delish!   Couldn't have had a better experience - highly recommended... go enjoy people!",

Ingredients tasted fresh, my Costa Burrito was pretty tasty, filling and with a little bit of a spice. The side of bacon was a little pricey, hash browns were included and well prepared. I would probably order the same thing again if I came back.  The French Toast Looked amazing!  Wife enjoyed her eggs Benedict, but she hasn't mentioned them fourteen times since we left, so they must not have been anything outstanding.  If you're looking for something casual, with bottomless self-serve coffee, and a friendly staff, give Scramble a shot!",

I love how nice the restaurant is and how you first order your food and then you find a spot! I never have any difficulties find a spot to sit! Also if the lines ever long it goes by super fast!! Another thing I love is the self serve coffee! Personally I love making my own coffee and they have an amazing set up filled with different types of creamer! I highly recommend this place!! Way better than the other basic spots in arizona!!!",

    "text": "I went early this morning and dined in.  Driving south on N Scottsdale Rd, I could see the \"Scramble\" sign facing the street, so it was an easy find.  Parking seemed a little odd to me.  There are only a few parking spaces in front of the restaurant, and there are a lot of stores that share the same parking lot. I imagine parking is a real pain later in the day, but that early in the morning it was fine.   On to the food.  I like that there is a section on their menu titled Vegan, so you don't have to go searching for all those little \"v\" or \"vg\" symbols used by most places. This makes things so much simpler.  Because it was my first time at a Scramble (I have yet to visit their downtown location), I wanted to try a couple of things so I'd know what to get on any future visits.   Vegan French Toast: It was quite good, tasty even, but not mind-blowing. It was sprinkled with powdered sugar (which I love!) and I didn't even need to put the vegan butter on it.  I was grateful for the sweet and thick vegan syrup. Some vegan syrups can be watery and boring; not theirs. The toast was a bit challenging to cut (or maybe my utensil-using skills are challenged); I was seriously afraid that a piece of syrup-laden toast was gonna go catapulting through the air and into another patron's hair/face, etc.  I tried to carefully see-saw my way through it... I hope no one was watching me.  It wasn't that the bread was hard; it just took a lot of effort once you got to the bottom of that bread. Maybe it's the bread? Maybe it's me? I don't know. But honestly, it was still very good; just not amazing. It came with a side of fruit (actually she asked me what I wanted for my side and I just stuck with the fruit), which was fresh and sweet.   Scramble: So, here's what I did with my scramble. I wanted to try the Vegan Soyrizo Burrito, sans tortilla, but I wanted the spinach and red onions that come with another vegan scramble dish. And I'd read some reviews saying that the scramble could use a little more seasoning.  So I simply requested no tortilla, add spinach + red onions, add extra seasoning and make it extra spicy. I also requested that they cook it hard (I don't like mushy tofu scramble). The result was yummy! It was perfectly spiced. Kudos to the chef for hooking me up! (I believe they said they added jalapeno juice and Sriracha sauce.) For the side, I got the sweet potato hash.  It was good. I think if you're a sweet potato fan (y'all who must have your baked sweet potatoes & sweet potato fries) then you'll love it. I love regular potatoes, so next time I'll get the good ole hash browns. (I checked with a manager, who said they're vegan: cooked with salt, pepper, & garlic (no butter).   The food is very light too. I ate 1/2 of each dish and I didn't feel \"heavy\" like I do after some taste-testing sessions, which is great for a morning, start-your-day meal.   Pricing? For Scottsdale, it's inexpensive. My vegan french toast was less than $8, and my vegan soyrizo scramble was less than $9.   Inside was nice, neat, clean, bright (sunshiny), and had a large, open dining area. There were mostly tables, but around the southern perimeter there is booth seating along the wall, with additional chairs across from the tables.  There is a center station with condiments, self-serve drinks (water for me), utensils, etc.  There were several large TVs, each showing something different: sports, worldwide news, cartoons, and some other cable network cooking show were all on for you to glance towards and enhance your lip-reading skills. (Sub-titles were on for those too lazy for lip-reading) I sat inside, although I couldn't help but notice how cute the patio area was. It's a large/spacious patio too. I'm sure it'll get a lot of action come autumn.   The employees are all very nice, offering up friendly smiles and being attentive and helpful.  3 different people asked how my meal was as they walked by.   I would love to see them expand their vegan menu (ahem: vegan pancakes!), but for now I'm happy to have somewhere to go for a vegan breakfast that's not 30+ minutes away.",

I also liked the concept of ordering and paying at the till, grabbing a table and having my food brought out cafeteria style.  We were able to grab a spot on the patio and enjoy our breakfast in the sun.  I enjoyed a Tex Mex style benny - spicy hollandaise on jalapeno corn bread - YUM!  And my boyfriend enjoyed the Huevos Rancheros with more corn bread.  Yummy smoothies as well!",

It was a different kind of eatery since you order and pay before you sit down, kind of like ordering at a fast food joint. The menu had many choices but was not overwhelming. I saw after I ordered they offer a breakfast pizza; I'd be interested in trying it next time. My food came out in a reasonable amount of time. It was good, nothing extraordinary. The rest of my group enjoyed their breakfast. You have to come early because at a certain time the parking lot becomes valet only. Again if be interested to try the breakfast pizza before I waive Scramble off. Good food but again nothing out of this world!",

But it was lunch time and the Cuban Panini sounded so good...but was SO disappointing! One of my fellow diners also ordered a panini - the roast beef...we both sent them back to the kitchen because the cheese wasn't even melted.  Then they came back over toasted and hard to eat.  The third person in our party stayed True to the breakfast side of the menu and mostly enjoyed her meal except for the burned toast.  Whomever is supervising the kitchen should get their act together and take a look at the dishes as they are going out to the guest! Who would send out burned toast and call that acceptable??? One of us had a side salad with the disastrous panini's and there was a the core stem from a head of lettuce mixed in! I showed it to our waiter, who took it and showed it to a \"manager\", but we got no response, we paid our bill and left very disappointed.  I have two words for management at Scramble:  QUALITY CONTROL!!   Breakfast is the easiest type of cooking there is, and doing it poorly suggests boredom in the kitchen and a True lack of supervision.  And turning out food like we were served yesterday is unacceptable.  I would be willing to give Scramble another try, for the benefit of the doubt.  Most of the other patrons around us seemed to enjoy their meals.  Everyone has a bad day now and then.  I'll stick to breakfast next time.",

And even though I can only 1/2, when I re-heat the other half later it is still really good.  My husband had to try the Chef's Special cinnamon swirl pancakes--also amazing!  We definitely think they should be on the menu permanently!",

They opened a second location near my new place. I was so excited to go here for their first opening weekend. Sat on the patio with my dogs and had the amazing Chicago Brizza (breakfast pizza) which is one of my favorite things. I love the atmosphere of this place, and the food is always great! Prices are good. The weekend we were there, the food was kinda slow to come out, but it was opening weekend so I'm giving them a break. I'm sure it will get better. Honestly I am so glad to have my favorite breakfast place back.",

Think Starbuck's Pikes Place which is their cheap standard coffee. The Italian roast was a bit better.  Parking is a bit chaotic as all store front spaces have do not park here signs.",

    "text": "I live across the street from this place and tried it a couple of times after it opened. The results were dismal so I stayed away for about a year. Hungry and time stressed this morning I returned figuring it must have improved. Nope. Scramble continues to take the already deeply flawed concept of fast casual to a new low. Wanting only a couple of eggs with bacon, toast and hash browns I placed my $10 order with a cashier who seemed annoyed by my presence. She informed me that my coffee would be an extra $3 ($3!) and to get it in a disposable cup while i waited for my breakfast. Arriving at the \"coffee bar\" I found the coffee urn as well as the 1/2 and1/2 dispenser empty. On informing one of the half-awake robots the response was her being barely civil. On to the food. After waiting 25 minutes the plate arrived. Barely lukewarm it appeared that no one had thought or cared about the plate. The eggs, small but, thankfully, properly cooked,  were surrounded by cold sourdough toast, 2 pats of foil-wrapped frozen butter, and hash browns that were scattered around the plate, nearly cold and tasted like they had been cooked in motor oil. The piece de resistance were the 3 slices of bacon that were soggy, cold and had the texture and taste. of wet cardboard. Uhhhhhh................ 3 strikes and you're out. I won't be back.",

The pancakes were about 60% cooked, the rest not so much. I started slowing down after a waitress came by a couple times then I noticed the doneness.  I'm not the best a cooking pancakes and these were thick and had a good taste, so I'll give them a pass.  Plus I could have said something.

I attended with a friend and was delighted by the atmosphere.  Light and bright with some buzz.  If I was tired from the morning; not anymore!  The place is hip and hopping, order in line and pick a seat kind of place.  I went with the Meat Lovers Scramble and cup of Americana coffee -- why don't they just call it a cup of Joe!  Anyways, they even have breakfast pizza here! Cowabunga!  That's definitely new and something I'll go for next time around.  My Meat Lovers was yummy, Applewood bacon, ham, sausage, and Monterey Jack cheese in a mesh of eggs and hash browns!  A running mans breakfast haha!  The bacon brought the saltiness, while the melted cheese supplied the sweet mush and the hash browns was a hit with the crunch.  Add some hot sauce and yippy!  Overall, great place for breakfast and brunch; plus it's down the street from where I live so that's always a plus in my books! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "My mom and I decided to stop in here this morning for breakfast. This is a order at the counter and they bring the food  to your table type restaurant. The girl helping us at the counter was very nice & pleasant. There is a drink counter to get your coffee, tea and sodas. The decor is bright, minimalist and clean with silver chairs and pops of orange.  My mom & I both ordered the bacon and mushroom omelettes and there were many other items on the menu that looks delicious as well. I ordered mine with just a side of tomatoes, boring I know, no fruit no potatoes no toast. My mom ordered hers with the usual hashbrowns and English muffins. I got myself some coffee and my mom poured green tea to drink. Since we are only one of two tables at that time, our food came out pretty quickly. My mom and I both noticed that the bacon was very under cooked inside the omelettes. Bacon should always be cooked until crispy, isn't that a common preference? We started picking out what we thought were just some under cooked bacon pieces but realized that it was filled with under cooked bacon & no one wants to chew on that! So unfortunately we had to send back the omelettes & requested crispy bacon pieces inside the omelettes. The waitress was very nice and accommodating!! 2nd round of omelettes came out with crispy bacon inside so we dug in!! Unfortunately the crisply cooked bacon did not help these bland and boring omelettes. They were supposed to have garlic mushrooms, there was no hint of garlic anywhere! Severely under seasoned and devoid of any flavor Including salt and pepper. We sprinkled salt and pepper on ours and added a couple dashes of hot sauce, it just wasn't enough. Neither of us finished our food, my mom ate her hashbrowns as she was really hungry. My side of tomatoes were flavorless but I wasn't expecting much from those!  I tasted the coffee, it also seemed weak and bland. My moms green ice tea was tasty.  We may come back another time to try some other dishes, it got really busy so I see that it's a popular spot!  Maybe we just had a bland experience for our first time visiting.",

    "text": "Five shining stars I have rate here for being highly impressed. The affordable menu for all types of taste buds is definitely a crowd pleaser. The menu has traditional options along with some nice tasty treats you won't find at other breakfast joints. Scramble opens early in the  morning serving breakfast to closing in the early afternoon for breakfast/lunch.  I dined in for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. The cinnamon was my main entree. If you have a sweet tooth then this roll will keep you satisfied. Served warm loaded with a sweet frosting that is smooth like butter drizzled down the roll that melts right into your mouth. I washed it down with a fresh squeezed OJ. I had a side of Turkey Bacon that you could tell was fresh. It was delicious. I ordered light this time but was ooooweeeing and eyeing my friends plates who had a wide variety of breakfast along with lunch options. No complaints at my table all were VERY happy. Now I got to figure out what I will try next.  Just some added bonuses I thought I should mention: Trendy environment Big Screen TV Self Service Soft Drinks CLEAN Establishment Friendly service with a smile by ALL employees Easy to read menus on a big screen",

    "text": "Meh. I really want to like this place. But there's just something about it that's not quite right. I don't know why there is all these 5 star reviews. Are you guys not eating at the right places? Or are you wanting to like it because it''s nearby? Ahhhh.. maybe things are quid pro quo? I love the concept. Kinda of self service, kinda not. I enjoyed the ambiance.  Organic/Fresh ingredients. Im down. But there's just something missing... Maybe it's execution?  Maybe it's the food? Let me begin by telling my experience.  We arrived one early sunday morning, right when they open at 6am. We were one of the few customers there. We ordered the meat scramble and the wife had the bennie. They come out pretty rapidly.  That's cool. My wife's hot tea and coffee are yummy. But that's where it goes south. My wife's Bennie arrives somewhat cold, yet mine is piping hot.. timing issues with kitchen? Could be forgiven... if it was busy. But it' wasn't. 4 people plus us. Grand total=six. My scramble, ehhhh... it was okay. It's maybe a step above Denny's. My potatoes were soggy and greasy. Ugghhh.. rot gut all day.  Dan the guy who complained about uncooked eggs get's what I'm saying.  But in the ultra competitive Scottsdale Breakfast/Brunch scene, if you are NOT on your \"A\" game either in service or food quality, you're not going to survive. That's why we have such high turnover in restaurant spots.   Now before anyone calls me a hater. Read my reviews, I am an experienced foodie. We have dined at the best Scottsdale B-fast spots (Daily Dose, US Egg, Orange Table (R.I.P), Breakfast Club, R&R, etc) and somehow this place doesn't cut it. Maybe the manager better find some new cooks or change the menu.. cause it's people like me with disposable income and time to kill who can afford to dine here regularly... and frankly, im not really impressed.",

I dined during the lunch hour and opted for a chicken bacon wrap and side salad.  The ingredients themselves were fresh, but there was a lack of flavor.  Perhaps an upgrade to Chipotle mayo or something more flavorful.  The side salad was iceberg lettuce with a few croutons. ..not exciting.  There is both indoor and outdoor dining available.

They were what I anticipated to be, standard nothing overwhelming impressive but I was hungry and needed that heavy calories. A tad disappointed by hash browns. Felt as if they were frozen previously.  I also didn't like the chair. I was in my gym shorts and my skin against metal chair didn't feel good. They had cushy seat but I gave it up to my hiking partner. I almost thought about asking to switch the spot but oh well, next time I will wear long pants.

As a vegan with some gluten sensitivity, if I want toast I have to deal with the gluten.  I believe they get their bread from Gluten free creations, which offers excellent gluten free and vegan bread.  It'd be great if they used that.",

My wife had a scramble with gluten-free toast and there was a two dollar up charge for the gluten-free toast. Probably won't go back because of the price per portion!",

While not a religious follower of the vegan diet, I do like choosing those options when they are available. I ordered the vegan veggie scramble with a sweet potato patty and was still hungry after I finished my plate. The patty tasted burnt and not seasoned. Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish, but for the price we paid for our plates, I would have thought it would be more filling or satisfying.",

    "text": "Was checking out events on the Yelp app late this morning when I spotted a \"Breakfast for Dinner\" SNIFF fundraiser event (5pm-8pm).  I had arrived 30 minutes too early, so I called John at Scramble to see if I'd have any trouble attending the event-- sometimes events like this require reservations, but he informed me that Scramble never accepts reservations, that \"that's the beauty of Scramble,\" it's first come, first serve.  I did notice people walking in before 5p, so I decided I'd go in, too.  I was told that the kitchen isn't quite ready, but that everyone there could have a look at the silent auction offerings.  There even was a 50/50 raffle, which I learned gave the winner (name drawn) half of the pot, and the other half goes to SNIFF.  I asked if food and beverage sales were included in the fundraising, and the answer was yes, yet no one knew the percentage of the profits (the Scramble board director didn't know, and the SNIFF rep she asked didn't know, either).  I hadn't planned on staying on till 8 pm, so I just stuck to what I went there for-- the food!  :)  I ordered a cappuccino ($2.99; the menu gave me a choice of hot or iced, but the cashier didn't ask me), a Southwestern burrito ($9.49), minus the avocado (allergy), and a side order of dollar pancakes ($2.69), plus additional toppings of chocolate chips (+$1) and blueberries (+$1.49).  The restaurant is designed so that beyond the entrance door is the line to order your food, with the menus posted along the wall where you wait your turn.  There are also menus posted outside the restaurant.  I didn't observe any more menus to look at, aside from these two locations-- there may be above the cashier, but I do not care to look at menus posted high up, so there could've been.  I looked for paper menus, and there weren't any.  The cappuccino was served in a paper cup, which slightly disappointed me, as I am all for dine-in presentations (ceramic cups/mugs) and coffee art. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scramble-scottsdale-2?select=9YYDk0jNH9gxY60RXNcTpA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/scra...</a>  I was surprised as to how \"empty\" the cup felt when I lifted it to take the lid off.  It looked like a 16 oz cup, but was mostly foam-- at least 50%.  The coffee beans are from a Tempe-based company, but they're roasted in-house.  The cashier pointed somewhere to her left and back of the restaurant, to where I assumed I'd find the roasting machine.  I didn't see one, but there was a musician setting up shop, so perhaps it was kept away for the event... FYI, an event attendee told me that the musician had volunteered his time today.  I'd meant to walk over there to tip him, but forgot (sorry!).  He was kind of hidden in a corner, so I didn't even see him, just his opened guitar case...  The SW burrito (flour tortilla) was good, or at least the few bites I had off of one half of it. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scramble-scottsdale-2?select=m1j2vRlt1BYb5Wlw9F5XMA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/scra...</a>  It contained mostly scrambled egg, and what made it delicious were the bits of chorizo.  Hopefully the leftover half has more chorizo in it.  The burrito also arrived with a side of hash browns- delicious, but a bit greasy! - and saucers of sour cream and tangy salsa, but I felt that the chorizo added the most flavor to the burrito.  I wouldn't order this again, but I did enjoy the hash browns.  Next time, I'll ask for extra-crispy.  Note: I could've elected to swap out the hash browns for the side of dollar pancakes, but I wanted to try both, and since I was here to help raise money to spay/neuter animals, then the more items I order, the better!  Side order of dollar pancakes (three cakes), with additional chocolate chips and blueberries. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scramble-scottsdale-2?select=H9ciLgozSL2osAD8r-NeiA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/scra...</a>  Delicious!  Cakes were fluffy, not heavy/dense, and the chips and blueberries were huge and plentiful!  I would definitely order these again.  The Apple Cinnamon Energy Cakes sounded great to me, but the multigrain batter might be suspect (for me, as I'm allergic to certain \"good for you\" grains and seeds), so until I investigate further...  FYI, the maple syrup here isn't pure maple syrup, so bring your travel-sized bottles if you cannot have syrups blended with cheap corn syrup (corn allergy-sufferer here!).  I might return to try the French French Toast (provided that the vanilla custard doesn't contain powdered sugar) and more of the pancakes.  Additional notes:   1. Coffee beverages are made with Ghirardelli (chocolate and caramel) and Torani syrups. 2. The Sweet Potato Hash contains mushrooms and zucchini, and other items, but she lost me at mushrooms (love and miss them, but am allergic).   3. Scramble DOESN'T offer Chicken-fried Steak.  What? 4. Free coffee at Yelp check-in!  I'll use it next time I go.",

My only complaint is that my boyfriend got dairy put in his food after asking for it without. The only reason we found this out is because he's allergic to dairy and it made him super sick for the next couple of days. It was a bummer too because it was brunch for his birthday. If it weren't for that, I'd give this place 5 stars.",

The food is suspiciously similar in taste and offering to that found at most fast food restaurants and your chain diners. The decor is pretty cool, but it is diminished by the institutional style dispensers, such as the coffee cream lineup, that makes you feel as if your food is over processed and mechanized- not exactly what people are looking for in 2017. If your expectation is Denny's quality with a patio, then Scramble won't disappoint. If you're looking for something more I'd keep driving.",

    "text": "Found out about this place thanks to yelp as I was looking for a breakfast joint with non-dairy options for delicious food.  The menu had what I was looking for and the prices were right so we decided to check it out early this Thursday morning.  There was no wait and they answered my questions easily.  Instead of soy milk, they had almond milk as cream for my coffee which I have not found anywhere else thus far.  BIG BONUS.  I ordered the vegan french toast since others had said it was worth trying with a side of sausage patties after asking if any whey or eggs were involved and being told that they were not. The food was heavenly.  Fiance got the mushroom and spinach egg scramble and was satisfied.  I was beyond impressed.  This will be my new go-to place for breakfasty type meals.",

    "text": "Scramble is a nice looking place but I was not a huge fan of the order-at-the-counter dealio. I did enjoy the vast array of mix-ins available for the coffee, as well as the impressive selection of hot sauces. My main complaint was the noise level. It's just too loud in there. People came around several times to ask how we were doing, which was nice/friendly but all the interruptions combined with the ambient noise just did not make for a relaxing morning meal.   Food-wise, there were lots of great-sounding options, including multiple items for vegetarians and vegans. Deciding what to order was not easy. I enjoyed my veggie burrito - with tofu scramble instead of eggs just because - and breakfast potatoes. The sweet potato hash was not available when I was there (sad) so maybe I'll have to go back to try that. However, although I liked being able to just hop up and get more coffee, more water, hot sauce, etc., it's also nice to be waited on.   I probably won't be scrambling to get back there.",

The last few orders that I picked up, no one was there to check me out and I eventually had to just flag someone down, interrupt the other people trying to order so that I could pick up my to go order. I was not greeted, nor did anyone ask what I was standing there waiting for.   They now have online ordering which is great, but some kinks to work out.  I have yet to have that process go smoothly. The first time somehow part of what I ordered got  changed and they made something different.  The second time I had a typo in my billing address so my payment didn't  go through.  The online system requires you to put in a phone number so that they can contact you, yet when I arrived they told me that they do not get my phone number so they couldn't call me.  They pretty much blew me off during both of these errors and made no statement that they were going to attempt to improve the system, so that's a little bit troublesome.  The food is still great but service , not so much.",

    "text": "I've been to the Phoenix location and was enamored with their eggs benedict, so I've been dying inside every time I passed by the sign for the new Scottsdale location on my way to work in anticipation of their opening! Husband, his cousin, and I stopped in this Sunday to see the new digs. There's much more seating, but there's still that wait line, which was peeking out the door at 10:30am. Once we got towards the front of the slow line, an employee informed us that, after we ordered, it would be an additional 30 minute wait for the food to come out (the place was pretty packed). Yikes! Good thing they have alcohol here!   We ordered our food and sat down. Soon after, a server came by with a bloody mary, mimosa, and my hot loose-leaf tea (the chai one with vanilla notes, one of my favorites that Kelly R. had introduced me to). While we had a bit to wait for our meal, the servers were very personable. It was a little longer than a half hour until our food finally came out, and we were starved! Husband was quickly obsessed with his Costa burrito, his cousin enjoyed his traditional eggs benedict (and who doesn't love those rosemary potatoes?), and my Southwest Burrito was okay, but wasn't as spicy and flavorful as I was hoping. Husband had also asked for a side of burnt bacon (the cashier even said \"We have a button for burnt!\" which was exciting!), but when it came out, it was just normal bacon. The server had no problem bringing it back to have the kitchen throw it back on the griddle, so we opted for that... but we had finished our meals before we realized that his bacon never came back. After flagging down a server again, it magically appeared and was still not fully burnt. Whatever. It's still bacon.  All in all, I'd give them 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4. Food is better than average and they have some great flavor combinations with fresh ingredients (definitely need to try one of those brizzas next time!!), service is stellar, but the kitchen seems a little scattered and slow.",

As usual, clean restaurant, great service and tasty fresh food.  P.S. I still miss the diced rosemary breakfast potatoes they had a couple years back - they replaced them with bland, soggy hash browns so I always have to substitute those out for something else on my regular visits.

I was flabbergasted when I saw the two huge pieces! My kids have good appetite but no way they can just eat an entire baguette! They were not prepared well- it was not soaked in egg batter and also some parts were burned and some parts were not fully cooked through. We also ordered the garden scramble with hash browns. This was decent ana hash browns were nice and crispy. I ordered a side of plain gluten free bread for $4.29! Umm, a whole loaf of udis bread costs $4.00. The sweet potato hash was prepared like a party rather than traditional hash, not a fan. Giving two stars for the cashier, she was super friendly and triple checked to make sure our order was correct. The concept is great but needs cooks/chef that knows how to prepare food. I hope they are successful!",
