    "text": "I have only been here for dim sum during lunch on the weekdays, however it seems like this restaurant gets extremely busy on the weekends. Considering that there are only a few dim sum options in the area that isn't too surprising to me. The food has been mostly hit or miss as far as the dim sum goes. I enjoyed the Shu Mai the best and was definitely better than what I was expecting. The Har Gow was just okay and the sticky rice wasn't very good. Sadly the rice was too hard which it should be soft as with other places.  The service has been adequate to good which is better than what I was expecting. Granted I only came here when it was slow but they managed to refill my water on a few occasions and the carts came by within a few minutes of me sitting down. Other than that the service is pretty much as what you would expect at other dim sum establishments. I suppose it all depends on when you dine in as your mileage may vary.  While Mekong Palace doesn't have the best dim sum...it was mostly good enough for me. I just wish that the food wasn't as hit or miss from what I experienced.",

It's located in a little old fashioned mall, I call it 'the Asian mall' because all of the stores are Asian of some sort. They have a grocery store, a t-mobile store, a barber shop (which I also go to and like), an insurance agent, a travel agent, a food court, with several other restaurants that have dim sum, etc.... All serving the Asian community. My favorite is the big restaurant named after the mall itself, 'Mekong Palace Restaurant'. They also have a hot pot area, which I like too. You choose the broth and the different additional ingredients; meat, veggies, noodles etc. One thing I haven't seen is Sushi. But the variety is not lacking otherwise. So if you want the area's closest thing to a Chinatown come here. You won't be disappointed!",

Note that it is always very busy and that people aren't the most courteous when navigating through aisles, so just be a bit patient here.  I do think it is a bit difficult trying to find certain ingredients if you're not familiar with the area.  That have sections for different countries depending on their popular cuisines, but then they also have sections for different types of ingredients.  So be prepared to walk in circles.  They do have small rolling hand baskets so that you can easily cut through large crowded areas instead of having to use a shopping cart, which can cause a lot of traffic.   Don't be hesitant to ask someone a question if you're a bit lost, but also try and be patient and most of the employees may struggle with the English language. All in all this is a great place to get all your Asian cuisine needs!",

    "text": "I have been coming to this Mekong seafood restaurant for years. They have changed to a new owner. I had my wedding reception hosted on thanksgiving eve. I had about 50 guests, the restaurant charged me 530/table plus 18% tip. I paid $300 deposit in advance. On the day of my wedding, there was only one server took care of 50 guests, we asked the restaurant for hot tea, apple cider opener for many times, but just couldn't  get their attention. The service was terrible, the food were cold by the time they were served on the table. Two days later after my wedding, I realized that they charged me for the full price, even though I had paid $300 in advance. I went back to the restaurant with my husband to talk to the restaurant manager named Jun. He apologized and gave me back my deposit. If I never remember my deposit they will never give me back my deposit. I also complained how bad the service was. The restaurant still charged me $600 service fee. Few days later my guests told me that the fish that served on my wedding were frozen fish, which I paid extra for live fish. I went back to the restaurant for dim sum and  also complained to the restaurant manager. He pretended he was on the phone, told me to wait a minute he would come back to talk to me while he was walking out of the restaurant. I waited in my table even after my family finished dim sum. I saw the manager was back to the kitchen, but he was not coming back to my table. I figured he was trying to avoid me so I left the restaurant. I am warning everyone who is going to have a party at the Mekong seafood restaurant, this place is not running properly, over priced, terrible service and food quality is downgraded for what you paid for. I am very disappointed and upset.",

He gave us the menus water, and tea.   We were ready to order in about 5 minutes waiting for someone to come to our table. It was not busy at all. We went on Thursday nite around 7:00 pm. I saw many young men standing around and talking among themselves not paying any attention to our table. Another 5 minutes went by and I got the attention of the person who sat us and told him we were ready to order. He did not say anything to anyone so I thought he was going to take our order. Another 5 minutes went by then I saw a young man who was standing around talking to others when we arrived finally came over. I told him we had been waiting for a long time. He gave me the excuse that he was busy . After he took our order this was the last time I saw him. The busboy and another young lady brought out our food and the busboy refilled our water glasses. We had to get up ourselves and get doggie bag boxes. There needs to be a manager up front to run this place. The food is excellent but the service very poor. The wait staff doesn't care about service.  I hope they find a manager and better employees because the food is good but reluctant to bring guest there due to terrible service f the house B.B.",

Of course the pork buns, an old standby, fresh out of the oven are to die for.  And the crispy shrimp balls, woo hoo!  Me, I ALWAYS get a side of the BBQ duck -- and it is NEVER less than fantastic.   The fried shrimp, with garlic and jalapeno, wowee!  The carts just keep on coming, and the ice tea refills are prompt.  In other words, great service AS WELL AS fabulous dim sum.   If you're a Dim Sum aficionado, Mekong Palace is great news, you do NOT have to travel to San Francisco.  If you've never eaten Dim Sum before, only heard about it, go to Mekong Palace and be adventurous.   You'll be glad you did!",

The staff took the certificates, stood at the cash register trying to figure out what to do, and after appearing to not know what to do, suddenly informed us that  they would not take the certificates because it was a \"holiday.\" My husband is Chinese. It was not a holiday.   We complained again, and the new explanation was that the place changed ownership and the new owner won't take them. It's funny how the explanation changed. The certificates had no expiration date and no stipulations. These people are rude and deceptive. We will not be back.",

    "text": "We have been looking for a new dim sum place since our former favorite has gone downhill badly. Tried Mekong Palace first for lunch on a weekday and were pleased.  Asked the server if there were more choices/dishes on the carts during the weekend (as would be common) and she said yes, so we went back this Sunday and got there about 11:45.  The place was full--we are used to that--but this was not the experience we expected.  This is a BIG space and there never seemed to be more than one or two carts out for the whole place. We had to wait a long time to even get a tea set up, and with just one or two carts out at any given time with  limited fare, we had to crane our necks and desperately watch for any cart with items we were expecting/hoping to eat. Some items we saw during the weekday lunch never showed up at all.  One cart with the same stuff went by repeatedly, but others never came by at all (but we saw them in the distance). But perhaps we were confused with the set up--many people were having dishes of obvious favorites brought to their tables, people were standing at a take out line but seemed to head for tables too, and overall, we were left with the questions, \"How do we get dim sum basics for standard weekend service that usually are coming by so quickly and one after the other that you have a table full within 10 minutes? Why would a restaurant not seek to accommodate customers who are there to buy from them?\" We were in the middle of the place, not some corner behind a plastic plant.  We like the food enough to go back, but will go during the week, where the pace is less frantic and enough basics are served that one can actually enjoy the experience.  I felt like a hunter prowling and stalking prey--I was going after the food, they were not bringing it to me.",

I originally came by this place because it was the closest grocery store to where I was living at the time. The produce is excellently priced for the frugal folk, but I digress.  There are sides of pigs and roasted ducks hanging behind glass windows, a great start. The roast duck is my favorite item hands down! That with some rice will satisfy me, but there is so much more! They have an extensive menu with staples like orange chicken, to some stuff that I've honestly never heard of. They also have a very highly reviewed and praised dim-sum daily. I haven't been there for the fresh services but I've been luck enough to find some of the leftovers. After the regular service some of the remainders are sold at the to go CPU red for a mark down and every time I've had the chance I've gambled on those items. Some have been weird and some have been absolutely amazing!!",

Also had the pork chop and man..that was really unappetizing. So the food..definitely do not recommend.   Let's talk about the service. We came there and they sat us down..with no menus..and disappeared for 20 minutes. No one to tag down..like wtheck? So finally we saw a waiter so we told him we needed the menu. The waiter himself was very apologetic..even the table next to us told him we were waiting for a long time. So he told us drinks are free. Ok that's fine. Took forever for the food to come out. Service was mediocre. Asked for the check and nope, drinks were charged but I'm not about to fight 3 dollars off the bill. I just won't come here again. Food sucks anyways.",

They have a big sign asking for more hired help serving and bussing tables, so that may be the main problem they are dealing with.  But the dim sum offerings are inconsistent in taste -- some pretty darn good, some pretty bland.  The typical har gau, siu mai, and fan gau are good, but other dishes like the steam tripe offerings and the black bean spare ribs (paiquat) are pretty bland.  Also, we were there just before noon so all the dishes should have been prepared and available, but they were not -- we got our har gau at the very end after a long wait, but we never got our harm sui gok.  We saw one cart with roast pork on it, but never saw the char siu, or roasted duck or chicken offerings.  We will try again one more time later in the year.",

Nonethless, I am giving this place a 4 star for the food, not dim sum cause I have not tried it.  I have eaten inside the restaurant area and outside in the food court area.  Decent selection.  Good food.  Especially of note is their roast and bbq items, like bbq pork and roast pork.  Both are excellent and done right.  Trust me, if you go to Best HK or buy them from Lee Lee, they will give u fatty bbq pork sliced very roughly in huge chunk.  Its not the way that should be served as the taste of a giant chunk of pork is a little overpowering especially if you have the bbq sauce flavor.  My buddy who came to visit from Colorado loves their roast duck so much, he went there on the last 3 days of his visit.  His main complain was why I did not bring him there earlier in the week ?  So U know, come here expecting seafood well prepared ,wok dishes cantonese style, cantonese/hk style bbq and U will have a good meal.  I cannot vouch for their orange chicken or mongolian beef but if U want asian american food, there should be a good offering inside the mekong supermarket at the food court.  Inside the mekong supermarket yes.  This one is at the Mekong complex main food court.  don't go to the wrong place okay !",

So if you were really feeling like a cheapskate or want to avoid crap service, you could just order your dim sum to go and get your BBQ and noodle dishes at the food court side.  Dim sum is served all week, though you might have to order most items off the picture menu during the weekdays.  Food was decent, but seriously dirty teapots at the spouts at several tables I looked at... c'mon, take 3 seconds to scrub off the wall of brown crud that surely built up over several servings... that's how long it took us.",

I am a little reluctant to search for a good Chinese food restaurant here in Arizona, but I couldn't resist the 30% grand opening deal on dishes I haven't had in a while and crave.  Since it was opening week, the place was packed full and service was in disarray.  The decor was interesting....it was an attempt to turn an open food court into a fancy Chinese restaurant - chandeliers and all. Tacky, but honestly, I think it's amusing and gives it character. However, the location is very loud because it is after all an open food court. The table arrangements are also a little bit too crowded and I found myself almost back to back with the table next to me.  Food was decent and good price with the 30% off. I had the cold salt and garlic chicken, squid with black bean sauce, and the seafood tofu hot pot.  The hot pot was a little bland. It was nice to see them use fresh chicken, rather than packaged. Overall, it tasted decent. Nothing stood out, and nothing was terrible. It was nice to have a little taste of what I miss back in California, but I probably won't be returning here.",

    "text": "Don't know where I should start. Grand opening was on September 17th, 2010. We went to try this new Dim Sum place at the Mekong Plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising 30% off.  When I got there, the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular \"Chinese\" restaurant. So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall. It just looks too tacky, I thought they should've went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel, California.  Upon checking in with the hostess, they don't even issue numbers, they only call you by name. So that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things. Totally not efficient at all.  Once we finally got a seat, things got worse.  Our \"Har Gow\"/Shrimp dumpling was raw! The skin was thick and clumpy, the shrimp was severely undercooked. We asked them to exchange for another one, and it was still raw. We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw. Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food. Ok.....so how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food? That was probably the lamest excuse.  The trademark \"beef internal organs\" that I always love to order was pathetic. They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl, there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon.   The BBQ Pork bun, another staple of Dim sum, was not that great either. There was barely any char siu in the bun, and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked.  I understand that it is their first operating weekend, but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesn't fly in my opinion. They even offer wedding banquets here too.   I don't think I'll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food. The idea is definitely novel, but will be a hard sell.",

First the good: spacious, slightly harried staff were welcoming and quickly sat me down and asked which tea I'd like. My pref is always heung pihn but it never tastes like it in any of the restaurants I've been to here in PHX. Anyway, the usuals showed up in carts. I have to commend the staff who have to keep up in Cantonese, Mandarin, Vietnamese, and English, four times the number of languages that the average local speaks, and they do a good job of that. Had ha gao, siu mai, ha cheung, and sihn juk guen. Now, this is where it falls off a bit. The ha gao were oversteamed and so were disintegrating when you tried to pick them up, the siu mai seemed a bit old, and so too for the sihn juk guen, which was bad being one of the first to sit. In their favor, everything was hot, so, didn't experience any distress. But I was unimpressed. I did spot, heh, some spot prawns which you don't see too often outside of BC, they were pretty pricey, but, live. Later saw a tankful at Mekong Supermarket, still pricey, but wondered if they'd cook them if you brought your own, as other Chinese restaurants do. I'll have to go back for the dinner specials.",

I've shopped in this mall mainly at the grocery side but never strayed far enough into this restaurant which is opposite the grocery store.  I only wished I did a better job finding my shumai -- missed it;0(  What I did have was great, the stuffed eggplant, cream buns, sweet rice cakes, soy noodles, duck, taro bun, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  I paid $22.00 for my son and I -- a reasonable price for good food.  Only advice is to go early on a Sunday, they open at 10am.  My friend got there around 12 and had to wait awhile.  They will honor your request to seat a big party so my friend and her fiance' graciously saved us seats - 6 of us.  Bring your appetite - fair warning you may have to wait so bring a holdover snack!  It is so totally worth the wait -- we will be eating there again and soon.  Loved it.  Family friendly place.  One more thing -- the menu is at the reception desk, take out is at the back of place at the long counter.",

Before this place, China King down in Chandler was always my favorite dim sum place.  They had a great variety, the dim sum was not greasy, and the service was decent.  Mekong Palace does what China King does but even better.  There are more varieties of dim sum to choose from.  The restaurant is also a lot bigger and much cleaner with their tile floor.  China King's carpet has gotten really dirty over the past few years.  The usual chicken feet, har gow, siu mai, chow fun, and congee, which are my standards, are excellent here.  Also every time I go, I always seem to find some new item I've never tried before.  Price wise, it's as cheap as it can get.  With 4 people eating all the dim sum they can and hot tea, I think the bill is usually $40-$50 total.  To top it off, you can go grocery shopping next door after you're done or grab a boba tea at the taiwan cafe in the mall.  My parents said the dim sum was pretty close, if not equal, to what they get in the bay.  Definitely my favorite dim sum place in the valley, and I've been to  cfu, china king, phoenix palace, golden buddha, and great wall.",

And it is only open for 4 hours a nigh - 5pm to 9pm.  It's fun & a great conversational piece to have.  It's all you can eat, kind of Japanese style of shabu shabu.  EXCEPT tonight it was horrible.   all new staff and they depleted the menu by three quarters.  Most of the regular menu, most inexpensive portions, such as sliced rice cake, rice noodles, bok choy and white tofu are now gone.  What's the purpose of going.  Also, many , many other choices are gone on the hot pot menu.  And worst, the price went up $3 from the last time, which is still a great price, but not with three quarter of the menu choices gone.  So guaranteed this is the last time I eat hot pot at Mekong Palace restaurant, so sad.",

Our party of 4 shared some rib eye ($4 each order), lamb shoulder ($5 or $6), winter melon ($2), fried soft tofu, baby bok choy, lotus root, pork, pork blood cubes, and beef ball.  Generally meats will be about $4-6 and vegetables/tofu will be around $2-4.  Our total including one soda ($1.50 for 1 can) ended up ~$15 per person including tax and tip.  The meats and vegetables were delicious and fresh, and there is a sauce/condiment station where you can mix your own bowl of sauce (Sauces and condiments include soy sauce, sesame seeds, chili sauce, sesame sauce, satay, green onion, dried garlic, and cilantro).  Each person at the table gets one pot on an induction cooktop, and dessert is included in your hot pot.  We had a refreshing almond/coconut jello, the perfect complement to our meal.  We'll definitely be heading here again for more hot pot since it's a pretty good deal for what you get.",

Ok keep walking it might seem deserted later in the day but the food court was poping when I was there.  there's defiantly a nice selection of small business and restaurants.  Mainly the Dim Sum and the Soup place is why I go there.   Vietnamese place serves Hot Pot. meaning you buy veggies and meat and then everyone heats up their own soup. Installed for every seat at the tables is a little warming plate to cook your soup.  Kind of cool. Whatch out a few dollars here and there can really add up but for the most part very affordable.

Their Cantonese style dishes such as Wonton noodle soup, beef fried noodles, Fukien fried rice to name a few are all excellent.

But we finally got it right the 3rd time around. We feel bad cause our waitress got yelled at for not getting our order right, she told us. But we tipped her nicely afterwards.

I was passing by Phoenix on my way to Albuquerque and decided to get some dim sum, as the Valley is the last bastion of Chinese food before I head east. I honestly didn't know what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised.  First of all, the prices are very very reasonable. You cannot even get $2.38 for practically all items (except for large specialty items) in Orange County or San Diego. You'd have to go to New York, San Francisco, or the San Gabriel Valley to find dim sum cheaper than what you find here.  Secondly, the quality is pretty good. The shui mai was tasty, even if it wasn't great looking. The clay pot rice with spare-ribs was pretty good. The bowl of stewed tripe was decent, albeit a bit smaller in amount than I would find in LA. The only big disappointment was the fried sticky rice, which came out a bit dry.  Service was fairly decent when I was there, much better than the average in SoCal, which can range from tolerably forgetful to disgustingly rude. Sure, the service isn't the friendly service I would get when I go to a nice sit down Italian joint, but I'm also not expecting that.  Bonus, they do well in decorating a space that's essentially an end of an indoor strip mall pit. I'll be back when I drive back west towards home!",

    "text": "Ordered some dimsum to go plus the salty calamari with jalapenos and can i just say that their serving for almost just 5 bucks of calamari is pretty hefty. The dimsum that i got are shrimp shu mai, taro dumplings, and the crystal shrimp (not sure that this is the name). Anyway the guy that i talked to on the phone was nice. When i picked up the waiter wasn't bad as well. But when I got home i was missing one order of taro dumplings. :( i just let it go since 2.36 isn't worth arguing for. But all in all yes for dimsum, just double check stuffs to make sure u get what u paid for.",

    "text": "This place probably had some bad reviews when they first opened up.  They probably were issues at that time.    Anyway, My wife and I have been here many times as customers.  They have improved over the time, and are perhaps now respectable.    Go on the weekends (Saturday or Sunday morning), and enjoy their dim sum.  It is good for Mesa AZ.  It is not like Hong Kong, but it is good.  Also, you should go there for the hot pot.  Wife and I went there yesterday for hotpot.  I suggest some kind of combination like the following:  Szechuan Pepper Broth Chicken Spinach Vermicelli  Create a hotpot from this.  The only thing that I would recommend to Mekong Palace for the hot pot area, which you cook yourself at your table, is that they provide some recommended combinations on the hot pot menu based upon what they see being ordered.  This may make this more accessible and allow them to attract some adventurous non-Asian customers.",

    "text": "This place has some of the best dim sum I have yet found in Az (NOT the best dim sum, just the best in this area....) But, unfortunatly, somewhat poor service.   Actually, I'm not really sure what happened...I've been here a few times before, but the other day when we came by to eat, I had never seen it so busy! Maybe because of the holidays?? Anyways, they were definitely understaffed, if not out front, for sure in the kitchen......They didn't even have half the available dim sum dishes as they normally have. Plus, as another reviewer experienced, we were sat in the back near the stage, and barely got to see the carts come through to us. When they did make it to our table, the best dim sum was gone.   Funny thing, my favorite dish is BBQ pork bun. They, for some reason, were not coming around with them. So, finally I asked the maitre'd if there was any available, she said there was, and she would bring us out an order shortly. Well, the cart lady came around and I tried to tell her we had the buns coming (by pointing to the item on the menu, and signaling that it was coming) she laughed at me! And shook her head, 'no! no!' indicating that I was nuts! Whatever, I guess she was the nutty one, because they did bring out the buns just for our table. (see, they aren't that bad!....just, apparently, communication between themselves is just as bad as the communication with their English speaking customers!....)  To sum up, for me, the dim sum is worth any of the misstreament one may go through in order to get it. At least until I can visit Chinatown in New York, or if by some miricale, a new dim sum place opens up here offering even better food (and at least kinder service...)",

Nothing \"spectacular\" about the dim sum, but also nothing really wrong with the place, so I'm kinda wondering why the ratings are so low for this place! It's better than China king that closed down, and it's also better than C-Fu gourmet and Phoenix Palace!   But yes the only thing I recommend is getting there at around 10:30am. After that, it gets PACKED and you won't be able to get anything you want, because it's either super busy and they ran out, or you'll just have to be waiting all day for that one cart to come around. This will sound horrible, but you need to have someone there that knows what they're doing! I always go with my wife and mom in law, who speaks Cantonese, and she orders food like a BOSS! They listen to her every time, and when they don't have something, she MAKES them get it. Lol  But overall, Mekong for dim sum is worth the prices compared to the other competitors. The only place that I will say is better is Great Wall but it's too far away!!!!",

The place was super-busy (always a good sign) with an overwhelmingly Asian clientele, but we were seated promptly and the carts immediately started coming.  All items were hot and fresh. If a cart comes by and nothing looks appealing, don't worry -- long after you're stuffed, more carts with more delectable choices will be along soon...and they keep 'em keep coming!   Only reason I give four stars instead of five is ambiance -- it's basically a giant section of a very basic food court. But if you're craving a dim sum fix, Mekong Palace is a great choice!",

And we only saw one dish of greens.  All of the people we dealt with were polite in their own way. Which we don't have a problem with after so many years in Northern California.   The food was solid fare. Nothing out of the ordinary in presentation or preparation. But also half the price of what you pay for something really nice in San Francisco. So a nice place for just a plain old lunch when you need a change of pace.  This is just a food court attached to a grocery store. I would not try to build a special occasion around that sort of venue. I would not drive a long distance to go to a food court attached to a grocery store. I would not o there for a sit-down dinner. I would only go there if I had a craving for dim sum. If you live in the neighborhood, and want something different for lunch, check it out.   If the place looks crowded and chaotic, pass it by. If you don't see any carts, pass it by. These seems like obvious clues that they are having a bad day. There are plenty of other options for lunch nearby.  If you don't like grabbing and filling your own to-go box pass it by. If you dislike paying a cashier up front, pass it by. If you expect to have your hand held at dining venues, pass it by. If you're a first world whiner, pass it by.",

However, their duck is pretty good and they do have a grill alongside the wall how to cook dishes like the turnip cakes. Haven't seen many of those at the other dim sum places.

The dish with the black (\"thousand year old\") egg was not bad.   The book Choi with different tofu and meat was also delicious.   The highlight besides the lobster was the steamed fish, which was incredibly fresh and delicious.   The black bean paste dessert was ehh.

Stop at the host/hostess podium and tell them you are there for Hot Pot.  In so far, I have found Hot Pot at Mekong is the best Hot Pot venue in the Valley. It's not much on ambiance, but the taste is out of this world. Come with friends and have a nice relaxing social meal.   If you're new to Hot Pot and you didn't Google it yet, just know that Hot Pot is like Chinese fondue but with a tasty broth/soup. The food is brought to you raw and you cook it yourself.   \"Awesome\" you say? Indeed! It's very awesome.   You also get a bowl for additional ingredients/spices (e.g. Green Onion, Jalapenos, Cilantro, Sesame Oil, Sesame seeds, Satay Sauce, garlic, etc.) for dipping or to tailor your broth.  I typically get the following: Rib Eye, Chicken Breast, Headless Shrimp, Bok Choy, Napa Cabbage Udon noodles, and Shiitake. Sometimes my son and I get lobster. Be aware, it you get the lobster, it's divided on a plate... and still moving.  Hot Pot is a social culinary experience. So, just settle in for 45-75 minutes of spectacularly tasty Just-In-Time cooking, by your own hand, and neighborly discussion.  At the end of the meal they bring a cube of bone-pale gelatinous goo. I assume it's some form of bean curd. I don't care for it. My son loves it. I always forget to tell them not to bring me one. What can I say, the after glow of the meal just leaves me mindlessly, stupidly happy.  There are many other restaurants in Mekong. Shame on me that I gravitate exclusively to the Hot Pot (because it's just that DAMN GOOD) and have not tried any of the other fare.  The Market is nice and handy too. Check it out. It's only slightly less awesome than Lee Lee's, so it's def worth a visit if you are in the area.",

We ordered the salt & spicy shrimp from the dim sum cart and two other dishes from the regular lunch menu ( fish and veggies, and roast pork).  Both came with white rice.   You need to know that they don't serve brown rice so if you are thinking about health, you have no choice but to eat the white rice or none at all. The fish and veggies was fresh and tasty.  The roast pork was the right combination of meat and fat although the skin was not crackly, a requisite to roasted pork.    The salt and spicy shrimp (8 beautiful large ones) came with heads  and all which is not unusual in an asian presentation.  It was a good buy at $6.95.  But it was not spicy at all.  The 4 or 5 specs of jalapeno did not do the job.   If you order this shrimp dish, you need to know that along with the head and the body you are also eating the uncleaned intestines.  I did my best to pull out the string of greenish-black entrails.  I wonder if their other shrimp dishes also serve the ca-ca with it.   The lunch prices were reasonable and we were served quickly when we arrived at about 12:15.  The wait staff was efficient and friendly.   Still trying to decide whether a return visit is warranted.",

Phoenix doesn't have a strong Chinese food game, let's be honest. If you want the most decent, closest to authentic dim sum in the area, this is the best place. I use to really like Phoenix Palace but ever since the time they shut down randomly, it hasn't been the same. C-Fu Gourmet has never been good. I went once and definitely didn't need to give it another chance. Someone in an earlier review mentioned how things are frozen and steamed here at Mekong. I won't make a generalized statement about that but clearly, they haven't been to the aforementioned dim sim places (Great Wall is decent but it's so far). Also, let me just say, I don't want to hate on Phoenix Palace because they were my one for many years but I have to give my loyalty to Mekong now. Variety of items are good, flavors are good, portions are good, prices are good. Service will always be terrible but that's not why I go, lol!  I have also been here for dinner numerous times. I once had a waiter say to me, \"Ay ya, weren't you just here yesterday?\" I responded with *shifty eyes*, \"Maybe...\" The waiter wasn't wrong. I'll save that review for another time.",

    "text": "Mekong is one of my favourite places for dim sum in the valley. Any time I go for dim sum, or any time my friends want dim sum, we go to Mekong. The quality of their food here is quite good. We usually order shrimp dumplings, shumai dumplings, sticky rice wrapped in bamboo leaf, egg tarts, and a variety of other yummy plates. I really like the fried taro dumplings and the daikon pancakes. Those are sometimes not available if you come too late.   I usually set dim sum time for 10:30 am. At that time, it's usually still early enough to get a table without much wait, the food is fresh, and the carts are full of options. By 11:00 am, the dining area starts to fill up and the line starts building. The kitchen sometimes gets behind around 11:00-11:30 though, as it seems that the carts stop coming by for a good 20 minutes or so. But, that means that you have time to stop eating, relax, catch up with everyone at the table, and drink some delicious tea. Speaking of which, I've stuck to either the green tea or chrysanthemum, but I recently tried the oolong, and it is fantastic!",

    "text": "We were finally able to try this place and we were not impressed. We came on a Saturday around 1:30 and were quickly seated. However, we were seated in a side room. We were lucky that a couple of carts were in that area. We got an order of fried noodles and baked bbq buns. The noodles had good flavor and the buns were nicely sweet. After that the carts seemed to disappear. Eventually a cart with rice noodles came around but then our room was completely ignored. Thankfully, our waiter noticed and would get things from the main room for us. Being relatively new to dim sum, we had no idea what they had available and didn't know what to ask for. We were finally shown a menu but most of the items were already sold out. In the end we had ordered 7 things, including a specially ordered shanghai dumpling, and paid $42. Not worth it. I make better dumplings at home and can eat them while wearing my pjs and watching netflix! The only saving grace for this place was our nice server!!",

    "text": "So all this time I had thought there were three dim sum restaurants in the valley - Great Wall, Phoenix Palace , and C-Fu.  Today, I found out I was wrong.  There's one in freaking Mekong Plaza!  To think I've frequented Mekong sooo many times in the past and just glossed over the fact that they had an awesome dim sum restaurant.  We went on a weekday at around 11 and it was pretty empty so it wasn't too surprising that only three of the carts were out.  We had our drinks orders attended to pretty much the second we sat down but the carts took a little bit to make their way over to us.  Comparing Mekong Palace to the other three (Great Wall, Phoenix Palace, and C-Fu), their steamed cart was good, loved their siew mai, they didn't have har gow when they came by (frownie), the BBQ pork buns were filled with pork and gravy and were also light and fluffy - I'd eat the entire plate myself, don't judge me.  The desserts were a little cold but still good - the custard in their custard bun is a little more liquified than others that I've had, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and their egg tarts were eggy with the right amount of sweetness.  Honestly, since I havent stopped by Great Wall or Phoenix Palace in a while, I don't know how I'd rank Mekong Palace against them (sorry C-Fu, you no longer make the list), but you know what, I think this calls for some research, ie. I might just have to swing by to get more dim sum this weekend!",

Let's just say that we were stuffed by the end of our meal like a thanksgiving turkey. I would recommend going with someone that speaks Cantonese if you can. It's one of those really authentic places where everyone that works there is Asian and most people eating are also Asian. They bring out a different menu if you are Asian. Just like in in and out there is a special secret menu. Part of it is the duck trio. Duck three ways. First you get the large pieces of duck with the crispy skins that you eat on a pancake type bread. Then you get the duck soup made out of the bones with vegetables. Lastly you get the diced duck that you put in a lettuce leaf and make a lettuce wrap out of. Whatever you order you will not be disappointed. The only negative is the dessert (red beans) which is still yummy but not the star of the meal by any means.",

Found a hair in my tripe and there was a very small selection of dishes. The baked BBQ pork buns were tasteless and I didn't even get my favorite dim sum pastry - the egg custard tart. When we wanted to order dishes off the regular menu (due to the lack of food available for dim sum), a man who I believe is the manager walked up and told us that the kitchen did not have time to make our dishes. He said it would be at least an hour before they could cook anything for us because they were busy making dim sum. I couldn't understand how they could be busy when there was nothing coming out of the kitchen. I have to add that this guy wore a button up shirt and a tie. His tie was tucked into his shirt in between some buttons near the bottom of his shirt - so unprofessional. Then again, what was I expecting from a man who could not really speak English and offered nothing but horrible customer service....   Got a plate of roast duck and it came with a sweet and sour sauce... Never in my life have I been to a restaurant that paired sweet and sour sauce with roast duck.   We won't be back to eat here again.",

I'll admit I was a bit concerned when my mom's friend took us to lunch at a restaurant that's basically in the middle of a mall, but now I know why they need so much room - the food is delicious!  As soon as we sat down we were offered all of these different dim sums. We started with a shrimp roll that was so light and fresh and pork dumplings.   My least favorite thing that we had was the egg rolls - they were too cakey for my taste and it tasted like pork even though I ordered veggie.   The fried rice was flavorful without being salty. The Won Ton soup has a wonderful broth with both pork and shrimp won tons. But the real star of the lunch was the lobster in black bean sauce!!! I've never seen such a HUGE lobster ever!!!   My only real complaint is that the menu has pictures yet the food doesn't match the picture. Like the won ton soup - the picture showed it with noodles yet we were served noodle-less soup :-(  With so many different dim sums to try I can't wait to go back",

The food is usually consistent, which means you know what you expect which isn't anything to rave about. The variety is there usually but I haven't been there on a weekday. The common fares (shu mai, hargow, and the beloved chicken feet) are usually bountiful which I know is always a problem at other places when you have to wait for them to make more but sometimes its just one cart of them it seems and you either wait patiently or do like the older patrons and just attack the cart directly.",

As I said, everything was great, but a couple of things stand out.  The fried shrimp balls are very good along with the shrimp egg rolls.

Even though the restaurant itself sits in the back of a shopping center, once you are seated you sort of forget that you are in a shopping plaza.  We tried at least 15 different items, everything was delish, my son really enjoyed the shark fin rolls the roasted duck, we also tried noddle dishes, a chicken and rice dish, steamed bbq pork buns, oh gosh we tried everything,  every dish offered a new flavor and everything was very yummy!  Like I said we were a party of 10, and tried over 15 different styled dishes and the total bill for each of us with tip included: $13 bucks! That's right! Great meal for an excellent price, but have to be honest, none of were thinking with our wallet when picking items, we just wanted to tried all the things we could and I was quite shocked to learn it was just 13 per person.   It was a great time had by all, and I look forward to coming back!",

We were sat at the very back of the place next to a really filthy fish tank. The table looked dirty but I think it's really more from too much wear. The restaurant didn't have defined walkways, so there was a lot of weaving through tables and searching for room to walk through.   Let's talk about the service... we asked for forks for the younger guests that were with us and the server seemed to be bothered with the fact that he had to go out of their way to get us forks. At the end of the meal, we were given the bill, we waited for 10 minutes holding up the check trying to flag someone to take our payment. The rest of our party had already dispersed at this time. Finally, one server came to us and we tried to hand them the bill back and she just waved her hand no and walked away. Okay........ Luckily one of the people in our party came back and told us that they're taking payment up front. Couldn't the server have told us that?!?!  As for the food, we ordered noodles, veggies, turnip cakes, sesame balls, egg cream buns, pork shumai, fried shrimp wonton, hargow and so many others. Everything was good. No complaints in the food area.... except when we told the lady we wanted shrimp shumai she have us pork shumai and figured we didn't know the difference????",

    "text": "We frequently visit the Mekong Plaza for the fantastic myriad restaurants in the center. One of our favorites is Dim Sum in the Mekong Palace open air restaurant at the northwest end of the plaza.  The staff is usually pretty attentive, but we often feel like we get second class service as \" the white folk in the room\". We normally wait for beverage refills and the check.  If you can look past that as merely a cultural thing, you will like the offerings at Mekong Palace. The Dim Sum is plentiful and great quality. It's always hot, and the steam carts are on it like white on rice and a paper plate in a snowstorm! They are everywhere with the goods.  In addition to Dim Sum, we enjoy the sticky rice and other menu items. At least once a week, we get some BBQ pork or roasted pork from the window to take home. The only iffy item we ever got was a whole roasted duck for Thanksgiving. The kids were scared of it, then everyone got sick after eating it. Just a fluke I guess, since we've never had issues before.  As long as you are ok with the open air restaurant and sometimes the noise that comes with it, you will not be disappointed by the great offerings at Mekong.",

Sunday's are normally busy and a 15-20 minute wait is expected, so not a big deal. In fact we were seated pretty quickly for it being a Sunday. The food was great, as usual. The biggest issue was the fact that there were ZERO carts of dimsum being pushed around when we were seated. They were all parked by the counter, waiting to be refilled. Mind you, it is noon. Wouldn't it make sense to make enough food for your lunch rush? We waited a full 20-30 minutes before the first cart even passed by our table, and they didn't have much by the time it got to us. The food was a 4, but the service and kitchen preparedness was definitely  a zero.",

    "text": "I've been going here since 2012ish for dim sum and it's literally just plain and simple to the point dim sum. If I don't really feel like driving all the way to Phoenix to go wait 45 minutes for a table at Great Wall, I usually resort here. It's not bad, but it's certainly not the best I've had. From what AZ has to offer it's decent. Large seating area and open space create routes for cart pushers to maneuver around. My go-tos are pretty standard here; siu mai, har gow, shrimp rice noodle, bbq pork bun, and sometimes taro cake and an egg custard bun. Though, commonly in dim sum  restaurants there's going to be what I call \"equally curving\". Usually they'll come up to you offering what they currently have in their cart, so if you don't want any, curve em. But then again they can also curve yo ass by not even looking at you and walking past your table. Pretty common. Sometimes they'll speak Cantonese to me like I know what they're saying, pretty normal. So expect to be skipped at times. I remember the water here was absolutely delicious. But that was long ago. What I can say is that if you're looking for a place to eat dim sum on the east valley, I can say this is a good choice. Keep in mind this place can get busy. So go inside and get a number to be called on instead of waiting for your other friends to come through and end up waiting even longer. Be a team player",

Came towards the end so they had to make some things fresh for me which was good but I usually like to look through the cart and pick out whatever items I want. Staff is a little difficult to understand. Food was prepared nicely and they had a good variety. The only problem was there in the Mekong Plaza and about 25% of the store say Mekong on it so if you're trying to find them they are in the middle of the plaza in doors. Will definitely go back and check it out another time earlier in the day. They stop serving at 2:45",

This incident isn't the first but the second. It seems that the management believes that one cart can feed the entire table. Well I'm telling you, it CAN'T.   I understand it takes time around for the carts but it doesn't take 20 dang minutes. This didn't just occurred to my table but as well for others near me. We had to go up meaning stand up and get our food. Funny part, they legit only had two carts roaming around while I see a bunch of filled carts in the back. No, they didn't have short of staff working. The rice noodle rolls aka CheungFun was made frozen before. Sorry to break it to the CheungFun lovers. A bunch of the dim sum isn't fresh. Some would even stick on the container. Annoying. We would ask them for a certain bun dish, they said it would take some time to steam so I'll place your order in right away. We asked multiple employees. But, no one placed the order in at all. My family was so upset and hungry. #HANGRY   The service here seems to get worst each visit. We couldn't wait any longer for these carts to come by to our tables so we decided to pay and leave. I knew paying here would be horrifying because they have a long line near the meat. But we decided to pay in the front where there was a REGISTER. The guy was like \"No, you can't pay here, you need to go over there\". Wow, when I thought I couldn't get out of here ASAP. A lady came moments later and rung me up where the guy told me I couldn't pay here. Like seriously, what are you doing standing here picking your nose doing nothing?   I would not recommend this place to anyone who is a DimSum lover because this place would destroy it. The food service is not worth the waiting. I would not be returning after this experience twice.",

    "text": "Two stars for the food, NEGATIVE stars for everything else. Came here at noon with my mom and husband on a Saturday for dim sum and the place was a disaster of epic proportions. We've been coming here since they opened and it's always been busy, but this was a new low. Here are the highlights:  - A crowd of people swarming the ONE cash register at the entrance with one employee taking payments AND walking incoming parties to their tables.   - SEVERELY understaffed. Sat for a good 30 min straight without any dim sum carts even coming close to our table. A server took our drink order and we did not see her again for an HOUR when she refilled our waters.  - Servers all looked stressed out and it showed in their bad attitudes to customers. When my mom went up to one such server and asked for an order because we were all so hungry waiting forever for food, the server gave her THE dirtiest look. Multiple people were coming up to them with orders since the carts were clearly not going around to all the tables. There were only four tiny carts total serving close to 200 people.   - Bonus: a full fledged FIGHT between two male servers broke out at the order pickup counter in plain sight of all the customers in the dining area. Was it highly unprofessional? Yes. Am I sympathetic to their plight? Yes. They're certainly not getting paid enough to endure this misery.   - No variety of dim sum and many dishes were cold by the time the cart arrived at our table. Did not see a single potsticker or egg tart and it took over an hour to even lay eyes on some shumai.   Note to management: if you don't have the resources or manpower to serve all the extra tables you've added to your restaurant, maybe hire more employees or seat less customers. Ever heard of quality over quantity? This place has gone SO far downhill since it first opened.   Bottom line: spare yourself the headache of coming here. You will leave with a bad taste in your mouth that's not just from the MSG in the food!",

Ambience: basically the indoor courtyard of one end of the mall so a bit noisy with the atmosphere as described.   Food: not bad but not awesome. If convenient to you, I understand coming here. But as we came from Peoria, def not worth the drive. Standard fare was pretty good: sia mai, har gow, char siu baos. The lotus leaf-wrapped sticky rice and turnip cakes were really good. The fried pork dumplings were tasty if you could find any filling--mostly dough.   Service was typical Asian awful. Waited 40min for our turnip cakes. Tough to get water refills. We got our own leftover containers. And no one would come to give us a bill. Given my frustration over the lack of service and bill, we could have easily have just walked out. But integrity and honesty had me walking to the counter to get a bill and pay it despite having to wait 15min in line.   Bottom line: NEVER COMING BACK. Def not worth my drive.",

We booked in advance for 3 tables, and although the restaurant is really just a part of the food court, they were able to partition off a semi-private section for us. On the day of the event, they called to inform us that the chicken dish on the banquet menu was unavailable and offered to replace it with a different chicken dish. We agreed because we weren't sure of any better alternatives, but that dish actually ended up being the least popular dish of the whole meal. Overall, all of the dishes were very mediocre and not that memorable. Additionally, the steamed fish was not tender at all and not the appropriate kind of fish to be serving steamed.   One of the waiters also had an off-putting manner (responding sarcastically when we made requests), and didn't even have knowledge of the menu (he mistook bamboo fungus for fish belly). Additionally, only two of the three tables were large enough to serve banquet-style. The third table (the one I sat at) was could only fit 4-5 dishes at a time, making it necessary for them to constantly be shifting things to smaller plates/packing dishes away.   Good venue for a large group, but not the best setting/quality of food for an important event.",

    "text": "We were demanded by the cashier at check out to leave the tips with her, she was mean, vicious and rude to us.  We had been there four times prior to that visit  and always tipped. We even tipped the hot pot cook and also left a tip on the table  even when we did not get much service from the waitress. The cook was the one who did everything, and we have never once gone there without tipping. They pull the tips together and share them at the end of the shift, that's what I was told .            So after she demanded money from me I told her we left the tips on the table, she said,\"no\" and then put her hand out  and told me I have to give her the tips  before I leave , also retorted with a more vicious Voice and said to us that we did not leave a tip last time.  I told her  we always tip never once have we walk out of there without tipping. She told me the waitress  had told her that we did not tip the last time .   See , The waitress could have kept the tips and told the group that We  didn't tip , we left her seven dollars that day . So I told the cashier the tips are  on the table and she said  loudly that she is going to  check  if The tips are on the table , this is so demeaning to us , as she was  approaching to the hot pot area she was stopped by another  worker words exchanged among them , The cashier did not go through with going to the table to check.      I was furious  , I have never been so humiliated and insulted in front of everyone ever in my life over tipping .  I had a restaurant before so  I know about tipping, she was very bold and disrespectful to us so I yelled at her and ask her how could she talk to the customer with such nasty Rotten attitude . Finally I found the manager she acknowledged that she had picked up the tips from the table already,  because she was circling our table towards the end of the meal and I couldn't figure out why , because we have never seen The manageraround the  hot pot area  before. Now I know why,  it's because somebody had told her that we did not tip the last time when we're there , which is a big lie.        We always tip even when the waitress did not deserve to be tipped. The cook was the  one who brought us the food and the drink , refill our soup  and refill our dishes. I have often  refilled my own soup because there's no one around , because the cook was  busy in the kitchen and there's no waitress around.   The waitress only comes  around towards the end of   the meal to see if everything is OK And   to make sure the tips are on the table. And there's always  at least five dollars on the table for the waitress and the cook even though she didn't serve us . I know for a fact that they would never treated or talked to us that way if my husband was Chinese.  because I know that  they would never ask anybody  who comes  to pay at the register to Leave the  tips with the cashier in a demanding way as was put forth to us. The cashier Saw us less than her equal That's why she was so cocky and daring with this.       Every time when my husband goes up to the register to pay the cashier always asked  my husband to  leave the tips in the front with her. My husband is a black man so they fell Black people usually don't tip so let's ask him to pay upfront.        The first time we ever visited this great restaurant, my husband gave in to her asking for the tip to be left with her, the cashier. During this first occasion my husband did as she asked. Being that this was the first time,  I have told him there's no reason to leave the tips with her; what if she keeps the money for herself. I know for certain that my waitress kept the  seven dollars I gave her and did not turn it in and told a lie about us not leaving any tip.  They have a thief  among them perhaps more than one , they should always questioned the employees first before accusing their customers , especially from regular weekly customer that always Tipped , and most importantly they should never confront  customer about tips  under no circumstances , because there is no law stated that tipping is mandatory. It's a shame that this had happened, I hope the owner of this establishment can fix this issue, because this is racism and discrimination .   I do not think we will visit this restaurant ever again , which is too bad for The restaurant ,  because we go there once a week  and Spend close to $300 A month at this restaurant  .  Anyhow I will share my experience at this restaurant with all my friends And customers. For those who are  non-white or asian be fore warned  because it can happen to you too.",

So there was a wedding happening fine, it's big enough to have us in a separate room but whatever good for the couple, bad for us.  The staff was frazzled, I got yelled at when I asked for menus because we had 11 ppl and 3 menus. WTF!!! I also got yelled at when I asked what a certain dish was and got yelled at saying, \"it's chicken\" well obviously it is but what kind?? We ordered 8 dishes I can't remember what it all looks like.   What really ticked me off is the \"signature\" dish of the Szechuan beef with a boat load of oil. It actually killed the flavor, it just tasted like beef cooked in a tub of oil.  The beef was terrible. The only decent dish was the sweet and sour chicken that I got yelled at for asking. I didn't even post the other pics we got, it wasn't worth it and I was in a bad mood after my oil spill.  I honestly look at the cleanliness of this place and I don't know if food inspectors have come here, but there is no way they will pass. This is the last time I will be here. I'm over it. I would rather go to Panda Express. This place is out of bounds.",

There's nothing ambiance wise to keep you coming back but that's not really their thing.  Overall, not as fresh and a bit more greasy than I would have liked.

I didn't mind the wait, but what I didn't appreciate is that we were seated in one of the rooms to the side of the main dining hall and the cart servers only came around 3 times. One cart came around twice and the other came by once.  We were limited to only a few items (I've been here before and know the array of items they serve).   After we realized that no one would be coming around anymore, we just asked for our check, paid and left.   It would be nice if the restaurant had some sort of plan to their madness. The carts should have a route in which they take in order to the ensure that all customers receive the same level of service and food options.",

The hot and steamed dishes here are good. Chicken feet actually stood out to me as very good.  As for the other dishes, you should only take if fresh. Some items have been sitting out for a while, and you can't tell until it's already on your table and you dig your chopsticks into cold or stale food. That is one of my biggest turn-offs at dim sum places. They also need more carts going around when busy. Ask for hot mustard to mix with the chili oil, soy sauce, and vinegar.   For Phoenix dim sum, my latest ranking from best to worst  is Great Wall, Phoenix Palace, Mekong, then China King. I'd go here if people didn't want to drive down to Chandler or out west to Great Wall.",

I arrived early to get a takeout order on a weekday, around 11:35, and it took over 15 minutes waiting in line just to order, with only 3 others in front of me. They wouldn't tell the customers to stand aside while they waited for their orders so they could help other customers. I finally ordered around 11:50 and sat down at a nearby table. 15 minutes passed, then 20, then 25.... I watched as people who came after me got their orders. After 40 minutes, I finally asked the lady at the counter for status and what do you know: my order had been sitting there and no one had done anything about it. She just handed it to me and said nothing, no apology or thank you for waiting. It shouldn't take nearly an hour to get takeout. I won't be back.",

Food:  Dinner: There's these dishes that are on sale right now for less than $10 and most of them are clay pot dishes (which are DELICIOUS!). All the dinner items we ordered were AMAZING! Especially the green beans! Those were flavored and stir fried to perfection! I've had this dish many times at many different places and this was by far the BEST green bean dish I've ever had! The clay pots were ALL amazing! Everything tasted SOOO GOOD!   Dim sum: Not enough dim sum items and the ones that did show up were only ok. We were sitting around for a really long time and nothing would come. When the ladies did come by with the carts, they would not even try to sell us anything. We had to be all proactive and ask everyone what's in the carts. Even when we did that, the ladies would just say \"nothing new\" and push the cart away. We had to order things from the kitchen but even those things would take forever to come. A few of the dim sum dishes we ordered came AFTER we asked for our check and paid already.   Service:  Dinner: Great service! No complaints there! Dim sum: REALLY SLOW...why was there no food???   Ambiance:  This restaurant is in the middle of a food court of a shopping plaza. They just put up dividers to section off the \"restaurant\" from the rest of the food court. I was hesitant to eat at this place, but I'm glad I did because dinner was amazing! Dim sum...that's a different story. If you get over the fact that you are really sitting in the middle of a food court, then it's not so bad.   Price:  Both dinner and dim sum items were pretty cheap.   Overall:  I really liked eating dinner here! All the dishes were delicious! Dim sum probably would have been better if there was more food and the dim sum ladies were better about showing us what was available. I would totally come again for dinner but maybe not dim sum.",

I LOVE their salt and pepper shrimp, rice porridge and baked BBQ pork buns.  There seemed to be less food pushed around today, but the guy at the front saw me looking and brought the food to us!!   Like I said, this place is amazing. So much better than the phoenix palace!",

She blocked off half the restaurant for my guests and the set up was definitely more than I expected.  From beginning to end, the reception went perfectly. The service and staff were attentive and everyone raved about the food. Because my reception was in between lunch and dinner, we had a half dim sum/half plated menu and everyone had so much food left over to take home!  I would absolutely recommend this place over some other Chinese restaurants in the valley if you were looking for a delicious, clean (emphasis on clean), cost effective wedding reception or party location.  We even had a couple people who had food allergies and Sharon made an alternate menu to cater to them.",

This is exactly what happened just recently and was immediately noticeable when the food came. I knew right away something had happened. Didn't look the same, didn't taste the same, and I couldn't believe that two of the three owners decided to be the new \"chefs\". We know this food from going there many times and loving it. It's gone. Big difference. Here's a suggestion: GET the old chefs back. They were great!! The place itself is great. The servers are great. We really enjoyed this place before the change. But I don't think I  can go back. This review is NOT about dim sum. This was dinner time. What a shame. I gave it two stars because the servers are great, but....not the food. It's gone.",

Get up from the table and go order it from the stall and point to your table.  I pretty much liked everything they had there.  The other stand out that you have to get while you're there is the turnip cake which is the perfect play between slightly crispy on the outside to salty and gooey on the inside, and the chowmein noodles which were cooked to al dente perfection with the right amount of sesame oil to season...perfection.",

They even have the crappy service down to a T. Actually the service wasn't that bad, they did give us new plates during the meal, which is kind of a classy move.  The highlights included the lobster in ginger and scallions, peking duck, oysters in black bean sauce steamed on the half shell, and that fatty pork hot pot (the menu said \"Pork Hock in red bean sauce\" or something). The pork was stupendous, it literally melted in the mouth, the fat part that is.   Prices were very reasonable. We ran a tab of about $18 a person out the door with tax and tip, and we ordered the gourmet stuff, not the regular stuff.  The mall is nicely decked out with sumptuous tile floors, and it's kinda  a novelty to dine on upscale chine food inside a strip mall (the restaurant has no walls, just partitions to separate u from the mall).  The hood is a bit rough, so make sure you are taking advantage of the new concealed carry law, and pack some heat in the small of your back. Actually, a shoulder holster might be better, cuz your pants will get very tight after the huge meal.  Your Kong or Me Kong? MEKONG!",

This was a much worse experience than that...give me food or give me death.  I thought we would die of starvation!  We waited to be served our meals, from the time we sat down till the food dribbled out of the kitchen, for 75 minutes!!!  Then they slowly brought out our ordered dishes, one at a time.  First there was my wife's Black Pepper Shrimp & Scallops, a spicy dish. NOT, it was not spicy and guess what, no shrimp!  After complaining they did bring out a bowl with a few shrimp.  Another 10 minutes pass and my dish arrives, Kung Pao Chicken.  This too was not spicy at all.  Another 6 or 7 minutes later, my son's Shrimp Fried Rice was brought to the table. We had to ask for our white rice which they forgot.  I sent the pot of hot tea back because it had gotten cold during our wait.  The fried rice was average at best.  Is this the restaurant I loved earlier this year?  I guess we were fools not to have walked out after the first half hour of waiting.  We were ignored and they were not that busy.  I hate to think there was discrimination for not being of Asian descent, as were all of the other dinners, except for two.  So in review, the food was lacking, and the service was just about absent, ugh!  Guess who is NEVER coming back?  There is no zero stars, so I guess they lucked out with the one star.",

I'm not gonna describe what Dim Sum is, you can Google that if you don't know. Really, this is outstanding. The metal carts being pushed around by the Asian ladies, The bingo-card-looking things they tally up your order on, the shumai, the pork buns, the shrimp, the pork, the custard buns, they have everything. I am going back this Friday. You can also take home what you cannot stuff into your fat face in a to-go box, it nukes up nicely later that evening. I lived in SF and had the best dim sum in legit Chinatown. My lady lived in Oahu and grew up eating \"Legend's\" dim sum; the gold standard. So for us to be impressed, its gotta be something.

It was only about 26 bucks (sans tip) and it was pretty dang good if I do say so myself. The entree came with a big old bowl of white rice even though it didn't say that on the menu from what I remembered. The Wonton soup was legit and so was the entree. It was clean. I wasn't even that hungry when we came here but I had to eat it all anyway - out of respect.  If it's good enough you'll push through that wall of fullness. I am coming back for dim sum next time.

They use large shrimp in their dim sum dishes, and their stir-fry dishes have a really good wok flavor to them (i.e. well cooked). Seasoning is good, not too salty, compared to other Cantonese style places.  Unfortunately on the weekends, they do seem to get overwhelmed, and the quality and efficiency does suffer a bit, since they get a big turnout of ppl and don't seem to have enough staff. Being a busy Chinese restaurant, it goes without saying to expect the usual noisy atmosphere and blunt customer service..",

The Scene: The portion size for all of the entrees was plenty for the two of us. All three dishes were also properly prepared, including the quality, texture, and consistency of the ingredients as well as the seasoning and the presentation.  The Salted Fish with Chinese Broccoli was a variation on the traditional dish (usually with oyster sauce) that was new to both of us and which we enjoyed as much if not more. The salted fish flavor was bold but not overpowering, it nicely complimented the other dishes we ordered, and is something we would recommend trying to all Chinese broccoli fans.  The Seafood Tofu Claypot was quite traditional with good balance of flavor that went very well with the steamed rice. For me the tofu was perfectly cooked and was the centerpiece of this dish, as it should be, along with the usual assortment of seafood.  The star of this meal was most certainly the Intestine with Sour Cabbage and Chili, in part due to the fact that neither of us had previously tried anything quite like it. I'm a big fan of all types of cuisine featuring intestine and this dish was a real treat. The chili definitely delivered some heat, the sour cabbage added a surprising twist, it all worked well, and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  The Rest of the Story: Service was slow; however it was a busy Saturday night, we arrived rather late in the evening, and the dishes we ordered were somewhat uncommon. The Salted Fish with Chinese Broccoli was a little misleading in that the broccoli was seasoned with salted fish rather than being served along with salted fish. My fiancee said she found herself searching for shrimp in the Seafood Tofu Claypot and thought the seafood should have been more plentiful.  Epilogue: Overall the food was very good, easily deserved 3 stars, and was an experience that I believe any fan of Chinese food would have enjoyed. We elected to not award a fourth star because my fiancee thought the seafood in the claypot should have been more plentiful and that the dishes overall were a little pricey, especially the Chinese broccoli  Photo Design: by Billie Z.",

Highly recommend trying this place :)",

My main complaint in both visits is/was the food was not hot. Not even close. And that's unfortunate. The place was jamming with many diners and it was early enough on a Sunday (both visits) that the food should be fresh and hot. Noooope.  The lonjing (dragonwell) tea was great and seemed more than twice as hot as the rice shrimp noodle dumplings. Didn't see the muscles come around today or the salted fish. Wanted to try the duck again today, but was reluctant after having had it last time (it was stone cold).  Not sure I would return and if being honest.",

    "text": "My family always goes here for dimsum. This is their favorite place around and there are a few foodie family members too! This place is always full of Asians - that's how you know it's the real deal! I pretty much always see other people I know enjoying dimsum with their friends and family.  On the weekends, this place is always packed and there are usually several groups of people waiting. The host will give you a number and call out your number when there is a tavle available. They don't shout the numbers very loudly so you just have to stay close and listen. If you don't want to deal with waiting, I would recommend getting there early. I was there with family on a weekday during the holidays and it was still busy - but without a wait.  The quality of food is consistently good and fresh. There are some dishes or variations of dishes that are made to order and those usually come out pretty quickly too. I will say that it's definitely easier if you go with someone who knows the dishes. Makes the experience less stressful for everyone involved. The ladies pushing the carts do know a little English and will do their best to get you what you want if there is a language barrier. When in doubt, you can just point at the dish you want.  The pricing of the dishes is very reasonable and such a good deal for what you're getting in terms of service and quality. I would definitely recommend going with a large group of people so you can try more dishes without it being expensive.  The dining area is connected to the supermarket and other random stores/restaurants so it's great if you want to walk around to look at stuff either before or after eating.  I've come here at night when it's just a regular restaurant and the food is also very good. It's also not quite as busy at night.",

The best part about hot pot is that they have individual hot pots so you don't have to share with your table. There are few choices of broth to choose from. Also, hotpot can be enjoyed while ordering from dimsum menu as well. Best of both worlds.  However, the dimsum is hit or miss. Couple of items came out hot, but most were lukewarm. Some of the cart pushers don't seem to come around while others come around too many times.  I'd recommend coming early to get fresh/hot choices. Otherwise go for the hotpot.",

The dim sum at Mekong is okay. It's not horrible but it's not super awesome, either. I really like the dan tat (egg custard tart things) but it seems like they are out like 90% of the time that I visit. Since I live out of town, this is always disappointing to me. Also, the taro puffs, which are normally my favorite dim sum item, are not very good at Mekong. Their coconut agar jelly sweet is really yummy, though.  Non-dim sum food is also okay. I like their roast pork (the siu yook) but everything else is kind of average. I really like their peking duck but their lettuce wraps (an item that many Chinese restaurants make to \"use up\" the rest of the meat from the duck) don't taste good to me... at all. I much prefer China Chili or Great Wall's lettuce wrap filling even though I think Mekong's peking duck might be superior. Also, we once requested the banquet-style salad with shrimp, apples, melons, lychee, etc. which was a favorite of mine back in the days of China Doll, but it was not very good even though it was like $50+ for a small dish. I was very disappointed. Those are probably the only dishes I've had that I actually thought were bad. All others have been average to me.  Everything seems clean. Service is fine but we've definitely had some people who were pretty rude. Mekong is a solidly decent place to eat though there are better places to go for dim sum or dinner.",

    "text": "This is my \"Go-To\" place when my Pacific Rim upbringing bubbles to the surface!  As I have mentioned elsewhere, I lived for lunch in Chinatown San Francisco for nearly a decade (about 2 decades ago).  That said, I learned the difference between proper Chinese food and suburban American mall Chinese food.  The Mekong Palace IS NOT Panda Express, so don't expect it.  I have been to the Palace each time I need to do some grocery shopping for things \"Pacific Rim\".  And each time I would estimate the dining room as 85% / 15% in terms of patrons; a good measure for finding real Chinese dining.  The menu is extensive and nearly all the fish can be chosen in the wall of tanks alongside the wall - seriously I'm talking about a least over a dozen fish and crab/lobster tanks!  Dim Sum has been added to the lunch menu and for those of you unfamiliar with this treat I cannot recommend trying it!  If you are unfamiliar with the term, I would suggest Google or Wiktionary for a generalized idea of this treat.  I nearly always have one of my two favorites; Beef Chow Fun or BBQ Duck and Wonton Noodle soup.  Here's a hint, don't try to eat an order of each, they're just too big!  The soup is a meal unto itself.  Then again, there are a couple of dozen types of soup on the menu and, depending on your taste, each one can be delicious.  As for me, I just smile with the pile that comes as \"soup\". when I order it.  Before I leave you, let me say there are some excellent reviews of the Mekong Plaza and the various shops within.  If it's an Asian type of food, there is a lovely restaurant within the center serving it.  I'm just partial to the dishes I described.  Lastly, the supermarket in the center is excellent!  But then again, you may have the feeling you've left Arizona and been plopped in the middle of somewhere on the Pacific Rim!  Enjoy the adventure!",

    "text": "For savory dimsum dishes, I prefer Mekong to Phoenix Palace - their food is fresher. However, the service and frequency of carts is better at Phoenix Palace, and PP's baked goods and sweets are more numerous and superior (bread is fluffier and high quantity of fillings). More parking and seating at Mekong also!  I arrived around 11:15am on a Saturday with a group of 4, and we were seated immediately; larger parties had to wait a little. The place itself is quite massive so you get seated sooner. However, there's only one cart of each food type circulating, so it may take a while to hit all the carts. Also, if you're in a nook the cart may or may not skip over you so be on the lookout. All the ladies are very nice and don't be afraid to really WAVE EM DOWN. Sometimes if they see you have a decent amount of food on your table they'll pass you, even if you make eye contact with them :/  Shrimp dumplings are packed w shrimp, spare ribs w black bean weren't very fatty (oil was rendered out into the bowl), chicken feet were good. Their zi ma qiu (red bean paste sesame balls) are really good. The skin is thinner than most places (still about 1cm), and the red bean paste is pure (unlike some places that have a light brown paste). Really like their egg tarts too!",

I hadn't yet tried Mekong Palace but was in the area and I thought I'd give them a go. Really glad I did because they are now my go-to (the one by Lee Lee's got knocked out sorry to say!)  Really loved the freshness and flavor of the typical staples - shumai and hargow. For me shumai can be hit or miss with the depth of flavors but Mekong's really hot it out of the park. Also loved everything else - squid, custard tarts, buns etc - jasmine tea was piping hot and tasted clean and lovely. Only bummer was that my little party of two could only order a few things before getting too full. Definitely try to come with a big party so you can order all! the! things!  Service was prompt and carts came by frequently. Prices were good and a bit less than the other competition in Chandler. All in all, definitely my new go to for dim sum, which in my humble opinion, is the superior form of brunch!",

We haven't had dim sum since we left the LA area almost 3 years ago. I checked Yelp and found two places near us but thanks to friends- amazing Community Ambassador Joyce who said Mekong is where she goes for dinner and  dim sum and Elite Yelper Stephen who said it was tasty and efficient! That made my decision easy.   We got there before it opened so we could check it out. It opens at 11:00 and we were first in the door as it opened. They were still setting up the carts (very interesting) which let us drool over the dishes. Ducks and a pig were hanging waiting for the line that grew fast where you place and pick up orders. We got a table where the carts came out-perfect for getting first dibs! The carts rolled out and they were efficient! The people serving off the carts were so nice-if you were looking for something specific, they would go to the kitchen and order it. Right then and there. And, Food came out Hot!  We were hungry, the food was so delicious so we picked so many and ate too much. But we loved having leftovers since it will be a while before drive the 3 hours back down the mountain. We also ordered half of a duck to take with us. We had food for a few meals.  Joyce, you did not exaggerate! It was a steal for the quality and service was amazing! They were so nice! We went to a great restaurant in LA's Chinatown that we loved but Mekong has bigger and more tasty portions. They were even good reheated as leftovers. I will definitely recommend and will go back!",

Mekong Palace is one of those good old-fashioned dim sum places where they push carts around and you get to choose what dishes you want!  From Chinese broccoli to braised chicken feet, all your favorites are available!  Their shu mai, pork buns, shrimp rice noodle rolls, shrimp har gow, salt and pepper shrimp, and fried sesame seed balls are all small portions of heavenly delight!    Today I learned that if you show up shortly after 10am (on Sunday), then there is no wait to get seating... and start eating!!

I sometimes go to C-FU Gourmet or Seafood Palace but Mekong Palace has such an authentic feel to it.   This may seem silly but the chili oil is kind of a big deal for me. I love their chili oil. I have actually gone to a Dim Sum spot in California that brought me some Siracha-looking chili paste when I asked for Chili oil. I am always buying chili oils from the Asian markets trying to find one I can have at home that tastes similar but have had no luck. Their Chili oil is delicious! They also make the best sticky rice that I have ever had.   My favorite items are the pork and shrimp shumai, shrimp noodle, radish/daikon cake and of course any of the pork buns. I put chili oil on EVERYTHING :)  It's great to be able to get Dim Sum on weekdays! This being a great Dim Sum joint, it gets busy on the weekends. If I go, it is right when they open and then they fill up quickly.",

There was only one waitress so she was a bit slow but she was very nice. Ordered the Garlic Butter Lobster, fried rice, Peking duck, and etc. The food comes family style.

That they serve dimsum - wandering carts and all - not just on weekends (as Chinese eateries which also serve dimsum generally do) but on weekdays as well is a big plus and the factor that makes this my go-to dimsum place in the Valley. And my friends and I are always delighted to find out at the end of every dimsum meal we've had here that it didn't cost us much. Here's a little tip: on weekends when they are very busy and you don't want to wait for the next cart to come by your table, bring your food tab to whatever cart is carrying food you want and ask it from them; they'll give it to you right there and add it to the list on your food tab.",

The restaurant has the typical staple offerings, as with most quality Dim Sum establishments in town. The pork buns, fried shrimp, salted vegetables, and Singapore noodles were all solidly and tastefully prepared.  There was enough variation and diversity of the common offerings to please our palates. All of their standard offerings were delectable.  Also, their delivery was utterly efficient. This restaurant is like a well oiled machine up to the point where you pay and depart.  The moment you are seated, the waitress is right there to take your drink order and any other requests that you may have.  As she turns away to procure those items, the first cart is already there to show you the way to Dim Sum Nirvana. The carts never stop coming. You don't have to flag them down. Furthermore, they always have more than enough of all your favorite dishes.  When you're done, you go up to the cashier. Hand her receipt, and your credit card / cash. She takes care of the rest. Their cashier was as efficient as she could possibly be.  This one poor soul of a gentleman made the mistake of disrupting her system. He decided to keep his credit card receipt, instead of giving it to her. The typical protocol is after you sign, if you want a receipt, she will print out a SEPARATE one for you. Don't make the mistake, as this guy did of keeping ANY of her paperwork. She quickly grabbed it from him, and mildly scolded him. \"I'll print you a receipt. Don't take this as this is my receipt copy!\" Ooookkkkayyy...  None of us that summarily followed after him made that mistake. We paid and were out of there expeditiously - no reprimand necessary! =)",

    "text": "I can't really think of any other place besides Great Wall that I would get dim sum at. I mean, there are probably random places here and there but Mekong Plaza gives the grand experience just because of the size and how everyone goes there. First, I do suggest going on Saturday or Sunday morning. Even though it will be busy, I feel like the atmosphere is just that much better. Giving you a little bit of context, going to dim sum is usually a time for people to chill and see other people they know like friends or random acquaintances. It's an experience!  Food wise, I think the food is decent. The usual shumai and shrimp dumplings are tasty. I also like the chicken feet! You can look through the different dishes and pick out the ones that looked the most appetizing. Not as great as Great Wall (no pun intended) but it will pass for dim sum if you don't want to drive toward West Phoenix. Plus, it's located in Mekong Plaza where you can go shopping or get some boba afterward.   Like any great Chinese food place, don't expect great holding your hand attentive service. If the dim sum cart comes by, grab an extra dish if you think you will want to eat more later. :)",

Food here is pretty decent depending on what you get.  The dish that really stood out for me is the spicy salt crab.  I think it's the best seasoning out of all the ones I've tried.  Service is a hit and miss and pretty standard for Chinese restaurants.  You usually have to get up to get your own things if you don't want to wait.  However, our latest experience was surprisingly good.  They were quick to bring out food, refill our waters and rice before we even ask, and constantly checking up on us.  Specifically, shout out to the Hispanic gentleman who provided top notch service and super polite.  Everything went well during our meal except for the very end when we had to pay.  A short haired lady was hovering over my husband as he was trying to sign the bill.  This triggered us since it also happened a few days prior when we were there for dim sum.  We had tipped cash so I was wondering if she was trying to pocket the money.  Regardless, it was super rude and uncomfortable.  If it wasn't for this, It would have been a five star experience.",

The wait staff was absolutely great- to a man and woman.  The food isn't.  We had Muk Shui pork (Moo Shu).  The dish was good, but the wraps were too dry and the plum sauce was punishingly salty.  I like salt, but it was about four-five times as salty as it should be.  It ruined the dish.  We had Sesame Chicken too.  The flavor was okay, but it was lost in a red sea of some kind of jelly.  I wonder if they buy frozen breaded reconstituted chicken meat and just heat it and slather jelly sauce all over.  We might visit again for dim sum, but never will we order from the menu again.",

Last weekend, we tried the hot pot for lunch. Keep in mind, this is not the place to go when you're short on time. So if you're in a rush and decide to try hot pot, don't be a jerk and complain about the slowness. Hot pot is a time to relax, catch up with your peeps and enjoy the experience.   I got the spicy broth. That's the only way to go. Otherwise, the herbal broth has no flavor. I still added more spices to the broth. We had udon and egg noodles, pot stickers, beef, lamb, tofu, meatballs, mushrooms, cabbage, and bok choy for 3 ppl. The bill came out to be $20 per person. Not bad considering that we were all full and still had a couple of to go boxes. I was still full 7 hrs later!   I liked that we all had individual pots, you know, in case someone has bad habits and you don't want to share with them. The waitress was friendly and was always filing up our waters. It took us time to make our sauces, spice up the broths, and cook the food. We also didn't know that we had to pay at the front desk. We kept waiting for the waitress to pick up our credit card but she never did lol.   All in all, a very good experience. Next time, we won't order so much food",

It essentially took part of the mall and put tables there.  There is a more private banquet area as well.  It gets crowded pretty quickly.  One time, I got there early and was seated without any wait.  Another time, I had to wait about 20 min.  They have a pretty efficient system where they hand out a piece of paper with numbers on it and when the table is ready, they will call your number.  I know this place is authentic because it is overflowing with Cantonese people.  Once you sit down, the carts will start to come.  When it is crowded, it can take a bit for them to come around.  The variety is good.  All the familiar and usual stuff is represented.  All of them tasted pretty fresh and tasty.  Overall, I like this place better than Phoenix Palace.",

I've been here many times, for a quick lunch, a late night dinner, and a weekend Dim Sum event.  All of my experiences have been great.  First, let me talk about their BBQ: roast pork, duck, chicken, etc.  The BBQ which you can buy by the pound or get it over rice for lunch is very good quality.   This reminds me of the Chinese BBQ back in NY.    For dinner they offer a nice selection of options ranging from deep fried whole fish to a steamed fish with soy sauce, scallions ,and ginger.  Also,  I like to order the \"Chow Mien\" (pan-fried noodles) with your choice of protein.  They have basically everything on the menu.  If you don't know what to order, just ask your server, they are very helpful.  Now for my Dim Sum experience they offer your typical \"Dim Sum\".  I was amazed by the selection and quality.  I consider these the standards:  Siu Mai - Pork and Shrimp dumpling Har goh - Shrimp dumpling Wu Tao go - Fried Taro Cake Ha cheung - Shrimp wrapped in rice noodles  ......and plenty more!  Also, I have experienced a high level of service during my Dim Sum meal with my friends.  I would ask them if they had a particular dish, and they said they were still cooking them and that they would be ready soon.  To my surprise, when they were ready, the server personally delivered that particular Dim Sum to us.  That act seldom happens at a Dim Sum restaurant partially because the restaurants are usually too busy and because the servers just don't care.  You don't have to worry about that here :-).  Also, the servers speak english, no worries.    Therefore, come here and experience real Chinese food.  O, did I mention the price is super reasonable!!!",

    "text": "Went for dim sum today (a Sunday).  Not bad!  They don't have the \"buy X get your next free\" pricing that C-Fu has, but their prices are lower.  All of the employees were friendly and professional, and my water glass was always full.  The front staff (hostess/servers/cashiers) were all excellent.  Pork Dumpling (Shumai): I liked not having mushrooms in them, but they didn't seem to have the yummy whole shrimp C-Fu's has.  Still, solid.  BBQ Pork Bun (Cha Siu Bao): Served cold, sadly.  Decent, but not great.  I've tasted many better ones.  Sugar Cane Shrimp: Delicious!  Somewhat oily, but plump and juicy.  I was so happy they had these today, and at a price better than C-Fu!  Rice Cake: I think the server referred to it as \"white cake\", but it's the plain, sweetened triangular cut one.  Smallish serving, but with a good texture and sweetness level.  Custard Tart (Egg Tart): This unexpectedly stole the show!  The pastry was supremely flakey and buttery, and the custard was sweet but not too heavy.  I usually prefer my custard tarts chilled, but this was really good.  We were almost tempted to order some to take with us, but resisted!  (Bought daifuku mochi from the market instead.)  I had a taste of a warm tofu in ginger syrup concoction which wasn't bad but just wasn't my thing (lunch companion loved it).  Parking can be a nightmare, with many inconsiderate (or just unskilled?) drivers.  There was a small wait, but they went through the numbers quickly as we were before the big rush (number 9...they were in the late 50s or 60s when we left I think).  They could really use those buzzers than restaurants like Cheesecake Factory and The Habit use to notify you when your table is ready.  The ambience is okay, but a little off.  Chandeliers, decent chairs, and a fancy stage (blocking the windows), but it still looks like a food court.  I'm just used to the opulence of C-Fu, so this came off as a little \"cafeteria\" to me.  For some reason I really loved their water glasses.  They're tall, slender, cylindrical, and very classy.  Overall this restaurant offered good food, good price, and is a nice dim sum option!  The parking lot was very busy, so I wouldn't really worry about the location being in a less upscale part of town (by Tricity/Riverview/the old Levitz).",

    "text": "All I have to say is Hell I better move to California. Looking at the previous posters talking about how poor this restaurant is and how great the food is in California then I must really be missing out .  I have not dined at many California Asian food places, but I have chowed down at a lot of places in Arizona.  I got to say for me this place is awesome.   The Food court issue: Yes  the restaurant  is at the end of the food court.  So what; it's partitioned off except during special events when they open up the whole area as the restaurant. They have a stage area set up so they can have presentations or bands. This is a very smart Idea in this economy. It is maximum use of space.   The Food: Seafood so fresh you see it swimming in the tank and can pick the lobster, crab, catfish, ect. ect. Lobster for 9.95, come on, that's fantastic. The sweet and sour ship is excellent. Wanton Soup Excellent. Chicken and Snow pea's outstanding.  Hot Jasmine Tea FanFrickenTastic!!! However, egg roles were a little weak and they did not fold our Mushu Pork for us.   The wait staff: English is hit or miss. Most seem very attentive, our water and tea were refilled often.  We did have to ask for forks as I do not like plastic chopsticks. They do not bring all the dishes at once.  Entrees are served as they are finished in the kitchen.   All in all the food quality is excellent. The wait staff is fast and friendly. The decor is very nice. So I say try it, for the money it is well worth it.",

Well, that changed when the servers refused to serve us. Each cart skipped our table repeatedly. I attempted to get the attention of our hostess, who apologized and notified the servers. They then looked over at our table and went back into the kitchen. I thought it may have been to restock the carts....but when they returned, they only skipped our table again. It was so noticeable and humiliating. I promptly paid for our tea and left. I've never been treated so poorly.... ever. My daughter asked me why tbey would not serve us....I really didn't have an answer for her....but she had her own suspicions. I had always been a courteous and respectful customer when I was there with my Asian friend in the past and never had any problems.....I was so appalled. No worries, you made your point clear. We were NOT welcome there.",

No wait and they were very busy, they sat us right away and as soon as we sat down the carts were already coming around. We just kept selecting our favorite dishes and even took enough home to have more for dinner. The food selection isn't as extensive as Great Wall in Central Phoenix, however they have a nice selection and prices are really good. $2.98 per selection for ABC and D is $4.95. We had 4 meals for $30. The service was amazing, I would say better than any place I have been to here. Tea pot never emptied, water glass never emptied...constant attending to used dishes and very available if you had additional needs. We really enjoyed our brunch there and will most likely go there much more often. C-Fu Gourmet is pretty good, but the service prices and selections are a bit to be desired. Great Wall by far is the best for variety and quality of Dim Sum but Makong Plaza Restaurant comes in close 2nd.",

The restaurant is housed in the Mekong Plaza, a large asian shopping mall, The wait was short, and as soon as we were seated, the dim sum carts began arriving. The selection was enormous and included chicken, shrimp[, pork and beef dim sum, as well as the usual pork buns and very fresh vegetables.  The table turnover is quick, and he service was good, Total check was about $25. for two including tea. The decor is sort of asian generic, with dragons and chinese characters on red velvet plaques. They also have a  hotpot area and an ala carte menu, which we haven't tried. The mall has many asian businesses, as well as a huge supermarket with great vegetables and very low prices on asian foods, including live seafood. I recommend that also as a shopping destination. It is like SF or NYC,",

It was only noon but it seemed like the dessert carts made it to us five times the amount of times the actual entrees made it to us. There were not a lot of options for the main dishes. The ladies were real snobby and unhappy when we decline their carts. They took forever to get us the check. The only reason why this place got 2 stars instead of one is because of this Hispanic guy busting his butt off. He got us utensils when we needed them. He got rid of dirty dishes for us. He got us boxes and when we did not see the check...guess who got our back? The same one guy. If he was not there then we never would have even tipped.

The food itself was amazing. We ordered for a family style dinner. The sweet and sour chicken was good; could use more crunch to it. Pea leaves or roots of peas (I forgot what it was called) was good; not over seasoned and was slightly plain but it contrast the big flavors of the other dishes (which is why I like getting a vegetable plate). Fried fish tilapia with a soy sauce like sauce to go with it. This had an amazing airy crunch, the meat was soft and buttery, and the sauce was a perfect compliment for it (had a slightly spicy and not too salty soy sauce taste to it. Clams with black bean sauce was amazing; it was over cooked or too salty (since black bean sauce can be extremely salty if used in excess). The French style filet lignin had an amazing flavor to it. The consistency is so soft and melt in your mouth, but it seemed like the poor a whole cup of oil on it - that... I didn't like. Overall good food and service.",

You HAVE to try the coconut jello, it's one of my favorite desserts.  The consistency is fluffy, and not quite like a jello.  It's hard to describe, but so delicious.  Plus, prices are CHEAP.  I can eat here with friends and leave stuffed and only pay $10 (including tip!).  Hot pot is also great and they qive you a lot of food in each order.  I love that each person gets their own individual pot to cook meat and veggies in, so each person can choose a different flavor broth if they want.  Plus vegetarians won't get their broth tainted by meat-eaters.  The only con is if you arrive at the busy time on the weekend, you will have to wait to get your dim sum.  Best to arrive around 10 or 10:30 to avoid the wait.",

You can get your own individual soup to cook the food to fondue your selection of food.   Would suggest asking for multiple rice bowls to mainly get spices, herbs and oils.  Select your soup base, meats, fish, vegetables,  noodles and tofu.  We ordered the Rib Eye which I would not recommend,  fish fillet, egg noodles,  headless shrimp,  won ton which was a winner,  mushrooms and Chinese celery.   Get your soup to a good boil and add the food you want to cook and scoop out what you eat.  You will need to be a little organized with your eating tools so you could remove from the boiling water.  The spoon is helpful but the chopsticks and pincher are the best tools to get your food.  Will comeback again and add more flavoring to the soup and dipping.",

We went for midday dim sum (small taster plates of lots of authentic and unique dishes). You have to mentally prepare yourself for the service--three waitresses with full carts will swarm you at once and offer you all sorts of treats. It's pretty overwhelming, but once the panic subsided we were left with a pretty nice spread on our table.   Since I was pretty out of my element here, the only food I recognized was the chow mein (which was greasy and delicious). Some of the foods were one-time only buys (still not sure what kind of meat was wrapped in that egg roll casing) but others, like warm, yeasty pork rolls brought me to my knees.   All in all you get a lot of fun variety for a very low price! Definitely will return!",

The lobster is 15.00 per lb and it was just upsetting that they automatically tell you the lobster is 4.5 lbs exactly on the dot. It would be more comforting to see a receipt of the actually precise weight of the $65 lobster just to make sure we are truly getting what we pay for. However, the lobster was incredible and we had no complaints of how flavorful and delicious it was. It does not compare to the fresh lobster back in New York, but it was delicious I must tell you that much. It comes with a pot of rice and we got a coconut gelatin dessert at the end not sure if it's the usual thing they do or if it was a Valentine's Day special? We've been here once before for a wedding reception and the food was one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever had here in Az. Would love to come try their Dim Sum another time!",

    "text": "Mekong Palace is located off Dobson Rd. and Main St. in Mesa.  This food court eatery is located inside the Mekong Plaza shopping center.  Mekong Palace is a trifecta of a restaurant.  During the day they offer up Dim Sum, the evenings it's either classic Chinese dining or Hot Pot!  Dim Sum is what I like to call Asian Tapas.  Dim sum, literally translated, means \"touch of the heart.\" Traditional legend says that women would make dim sum dishes for their husbands before they went off to work.  For this reason, dim sum is very labor intensive, made up of small Bo-Bite-sized pieces (usually served in dishes of 2-4 pieces) with attention to detail; even going so far as lines on dumpling wrappings.  Dim sum is traditionally served for breakfast and lunch and is considered an art form amongst Chinese chefs.   Modern day Dim Sum is served by the waitstaff pushing carts around and in between tables, while patrons view and select the dishes in the carts.  My family and I usually go on Sunday mornings like most Asian families.  I jokingly call this Sunday gathering Chinese Church.  Dim Sum is also called \"Yum Cha\" or drinking tea since tea is the choice of beverage.  Mekong has all your favorite Dim Sum plates from Siu Mai, Cha Siu Bow, Nah My Guy to Guy Lans and Nai Wong Bows.  Yes, I know, it sounds so foreign, but it's the only way to order it.  No worries, the servers translate all these dishes in English well.   Make sure you bring a Chinese speaking friend.  Not only is it almost a requirement, but makes it more fun, as well.  I love the Dim Sum here not just because the food is great, but because of the atmosphere.  Mekong rocks out on classic Andy Lau, Jacky Cheung, and Vivian Chow music playing while you enjoy a great meal with family and friends.  During the evening, Mekong Palace pumps out great Chinese cuisine.  They have everything from your favorite Kung Pao Chicken to your Sweet and Sour Pork.  However, they also have some great classic authentic Chinese dishes such as Stir-fried Lobster, Mapo Tofu, and my favorite, Stir-fried String beans and pork.    Think that's it?  Well think again!  Mekong Palace also offers up Hot Pot style dining.  Here at Mekong you get your own pot of hot boiling stew and choice of flavor, while cooking your own ingredients made to order; fresh chopped vegetables, round eye beef and diced calamari.  I love eating Hot Pot here since it's very tasty and also very affordable.  At $2-$3 per plate, this place can get you full real quick at a very fair value",

Not all the staff speak English fluently and sometimes in the rush, they may misinterpret what you want.  For example, I asked for steamed shrimp and leek dumplings (rice wrapper, no egg) multiple times and they ended up bringing out the fried version (which also has a wheat wrapper and eggs...although tasty, my wife and daughter has allergies to wheat and eggs).  Luckily, a man named Jun understood what I requested and rectified the situation in a timely fashion.  Overall good place.",

My wife and I did try it the second time and it was not a mistake. This place is terrible. They had flies all over and my wife had a major migraine after eating. I think they use MSG on their food. MSG is nasty stuff that makes food taste good but it is bad for you. Their fried pork chop made me cough like crazy and that night had a bloody stool. Sorry for the details but I want people to be aware before they try this place. I guess if you don't have a medical problem or allergies, then nothing to worry about.   I thought I just share my experience.   I prefer Phoenix Palace at Dobson and Warner in Chandler. They never use MSG, food tastes fresher and service is excellent.",

We indeed enjoyed the duck. To finish the meal off they brought us a red bean soup. What a nice touch. The soup was slightly sweet. Very delicate. Nice. The service was good. Not one server smiled. Not one. One server looked like she was in pain. Kind of reminded me of a movie scene. We were served by 3 people. So if you want an up beat, friendly place...you may not find it here. In fact now thinking about it the place has a cool (chilly-cold) feeling.  Tile floor. Sparse furnishings.  Poor lighting and not on purpose!  Overall. We enjoyed the meal!",

Next time they try to seat us in the side room, we are going to wait. There are 8 tables for 4, and 4 tables for 2 in the side section which was half occupied.

They don't even ask. Hopefully they rotate items and/or have more special order items.   This place has plenty of seating which makes it difficult for the food carts to make it before food is gone.

The place was full and they only had one cart with the hot food going around. To top it off, we did not enjoy the dim sum. Overall a very bad experience. Next time we want dim sum we will go to Great Wall or Phoenix Palace.",

I think dim sum seems expensive. It was 3.28?? Per basic dish? Our bill was 80 bucks for 3 eating adults...4 hardly eating kids. Unless they charge per seat or something, the math was just not right. Dinner was lackluster. We ordered $150 worth and it was nothing I would come back for either. We got the stir fried crab (price was awesome but taste was mediocre), Westlake soup, duck, kung pao shrimp, house fried rice, singapore noodles and maybe one more item. Not a single dish made me think to myself that I would come back for. Service is decent.",

    "text": "Yum cha! Happy Chinese new years guys! What is new years? It's feasting with your family and friends. This is why our group of hungry adults decided to eat here Saturday morning. Come early to avoid the crowds, we were seated at 11am with less than a 5 min wait.   Dim sum is ordering a bunch of Chinese appetizers that are typically steamed and fried and you drink lots of tea. They had chrysanthemum tea and kept our teapot full. The standouts were the turnip cake made fresh on the side & pork dumplings.   The staples that we ordered are:  Har gow- shrimp dumpling! (my fave) tseung fun- long shrimp rice sheet with soy sauce. Luo bo gao-turnip cake!  ham tsui gok- pork dumpling.  lo mai gai- sticky rice  Cha siu bao- BBQ bun   If anything just wave down a waiter and point to the food you like.  Usually the people pushing carts should ask you what you want to order and should \"sell\" the dim sum to you like at a night market. It's very noisy but fun. However, here one of the cart ladies ignored us and skipped our table. To me it's still an interesting set-up that this dim sum place is just part of the Mekong food court but the food is not bad, so I'll take it.",

Why the low score - service. if you sit in the main area, you've get OK service, but if you get stuck in the side room (like Charles D said), forget about service.  At lease 5 tables around me we getting their own utensils, napkins and plates.  It took 10 min to wave down a waitress to take our order (fill out the Dim Sum sheet) and 10 min to bring us the food.  Another 7 min to bring up utensils, napkins and plates - I refused to get up setup.  One of our dish came out as we were leaving the table - about 45 min later.  The waiter/waitress never apology for being tardy for anything.   I have gone to many Chinese restaurants in many cities, but this is the worst service I ever received.  I've been here 3 times and yesterday was my last time.",

Dim sum:  The prices are a steal for the quality that you get.  Food is fresh, dumplings are big [that's what she said], and the food is just downright amazing.  It doesn't matter if you're the first for dims sum or the last, the food is always fresh.  Service is always superior and your tea pot is never left empty for more than a couple minutes.  Those kids are on the ball about keeping the pot filled!  I love their seasonal items like the little fried sweet potato balls of heaven and their special items are always exciting to try.  Food is genuinely authentic and I love it here!  Dinner:  Dinner is just as great.  Mekong Palace is the only place to go for Peking Duck.  While other places makes a delicious bird, they usually just give you the skin only with the buns.  At Mekong Palace, they hook it up.  You get the skin for the buns of course but they also prepare two more little dishes with the price of the one dish:  You get lettuce wraps and the duck meat itself.  It's DELICIOUS!  Food at dinner is just as amazing and the portions are gigantic.  This is definitely my favorite place to go when I want some Chinese food [well, here and my mama's house].",

I was in Denver for dim sum a week earlier and it cost around $38 for two people! I don't know if the dim sum here's freshly made or thawed from frozen but nevertheless I enjoyed my meal here. I had the taro cakes, the fried taro ball, siu mai, ha gow, shrimp balls with sugar cane, mushroom sticky rice inside the leaf, and a couple other dishes. They steam their food in metal containers rather than the wood ones. The only thing that sucked was how long it took for some of the carts to come around. For Thanksgiving they sell a turkey for $58. I don't know how it tastes but it sounded like a cool deal.",

    "text": "I am still giving this place a 5-star as we've been here a few times in the past few months for both dinner and Dim Sum.  There are not a ton of places that really cater to real Chinese food here in the East Valley, but this is one of them.  Sometimes the older Chinese guy is a bit not great with his service, but everyone else in terms of service is great.  We came here with our party of 15 the night before Chinese New Year's and it was fantastic.  The service staff which consisted of some young Chinese guys, a Latino man (we've seen him here every time we've come for quite some time), a Latino woman, a Black woman, and some older Asian women along with the older Chinese guy.  Tonight the older Chinese guy was alright, but everyone else was top notch and very accommodating and quickly getting us what we needed.  We got seated in an auxiliary room because the main dining room was taken up by a HUGE party of probably a couple hundred people.  I've never seen this room in all my years dining here, but it wasn't too bad and wasn't as noisy as the main dining room, which was a plus.  The food came out reasonably quickly and much quicker than I thought with having the restaurant so literally packed.  We had a reservation and the usually super large tables they have for us weren't available, so we got 2 smaller tables of 8 each in the auxiliary room.  We had our normal stuff - Beef Chow Fun, a thin noodle dish with pork slices (don't know the English name for this), Bok Choy & Mushrooms, Beef Clay Pot, Honey Walnut Shrimp, the House Soup, Crispy Chicken, Steamed Fish, Peking Pork Chops, Pork with the Crispy Skin, and I don't remember what else.  Our other table that we weren't seated at ordered everything we had PLUS Crab, Lobster and maybe 1-2 other seafood dishes.  Really, service was overall great and the food tasty as usual.  One thing is when you pay the bill, which we had 2 separate checks, they do not add the tip like other restaurants with large parties, so you need to add the tip when you pay yourself.  Not a big deal.",

The restaurant itself is really just half of the food court cordoned off to segregate some tables for the Mekong dining area.  They have fish tanks of live seafood you can order which is pretty neat.  The menu is pretty giant and they have a good sized selection of vegetarian food.  The vegetable with black mushroom dish I had was very good it just took a really long time to come out.  My buddies's peking duck came out about 10 minutes before mine.  I'm not really sure what happened. Our waitress was very nice and helpfull with the menu and our questions about the food before we ordered.  So for having a pretty long wait and the fact you are basically eating in a food court they are a solid three and it's a pretty fun place to eat.",

I have had dim sum in many cities including Boston, Atlanta, Orlando, Memphis, and Westminster. This place had awesome customer service. I have never been to a place that has refilled my water and tea more than this place! Love the service! The food. Maybe it was an off day. I was tasty but it wasn't the wow you'd expect. Dim sum carts steam the food so once placed on the table it's hot and ready. I didn't see it. Also the had two bottles on the table labeled \"soy sauce\". Surprise surprise one was definitely not soy sauce. It's vinegar (same color as soy sauce here). This place gets packed so I thought I would be getting some legit dim sum. If you're looking for a great dim sum place, I highly recommend China King in Chandler.",

I think I would rather drive a bit further to go somewhere more consistent and tasted better in the future.",

    "text": "Inside the mekong palace there is a separate area to the side that is actually a small Hot Pot restaurant.  While the restaurant area is fairly small they made it very functional, each table has two burners built so that everyone can have their own broth. They had a great selection of food to choose from (from your typical sliced beef to razor clams) after you order you walk to the front and they have a table that is just for all of the sauces you can mix yourself. They gave you so many options and it was nice to be able to make more than just one sauce. The meal turned out great and the service was good  Overall I was pretty impressed, it reminded me of having a family dinner at my mother in-law's house. So if you are looking for a good place to enjoy hot pot without all the troubles of doing at home but just as good make sure you check this place out.",

    "text": "Wow, this place has really gone down. Went for dim sum this afternoon and it was the worst experience I have ever had at a dim sum restaurant. I was seated promptly and my drink order taken right away. They sat me towards the back end of the restaurant on a side table. Wish they would have sat me in the center instead as that is where the dim sum carts seemed to pass and only there. For some reason they didn't think that any of the customers on my side of the restaurant needed anything to eat. When I tried to flag one lady with a cart down she just ignored me. A few of the other customers on the same side of the restaurant as me were starting to get annoyed as well and one gentlemen even made a stink about it with the manager. I did notice that the tables that got the best service were the tables that had larger Asian groups of people and if they were fluent in the same dialect as the dim sum ladies, even better. BTW, I am Chinese American and I found this offensive. Feel bad for any discrimination towards none Asian customers or even bananas like me. Will never spend my money there again.",

    "text": "Now i love going to the Mekong Plaza, especially to Unphogettable and the supermarket.  But i wanted some dim sum and heard the Mekong Palace in the back of the little mall had dim sum.  I was bringing along my nephew and was seated pretty quickly during lunch time.  Now I've been to allot of dim sum places in the Vally, and usually the dim sum carts usually come strolling to your table even before the drink order is placed.  Not here.  My drink order was taken and arrive but still no dim sum.  Even a waiter came by to ask if i wanted a menu like i just arrived.  I informed him that we wanted dim sum and said the cart would arrive shortly.  Now take in mind, there's about six tables eating during the lunch hour and only one dim sum cart going around.  So i decide to take a look at the dim sum and lunch menu in case it look a little longer.  The dim sum menu is pretty large and the cool thing about weekdays and most of the day, all of the dim sum items in the A,B or C columns are all 2.38.  The rest of the menu will cost 4.95.   Finally after two cups of tea the dim sum carts arrives and the lady at the cart is showing me items that pretty much i don't want to try.  I only settle on three items, the shrimp dumpling, the pork and veggie dumpling, and baked rolls with BBQ pork inside.  I asked for the steamed pork buns but she said she will have it later.  Since she didn't have the steamed buns, i settled for the pork and rice wrapped in lotus leaf.  All were good but very unexpected because you can get that at any dim sum place.   While eating i was looking at the menu, i noticed these soy sauce chow mein that look like something good.  It was 7.95 and didn't want a whole order so asked the waiter if i could get an order but a smaller portion.  The waiter said that he can make a dim sum portion for 4.95 and would be happy to get that order in!  That i was happy about and it took only a couple of minutes, which was quicker then the dim sum cart to come around!  Even thought i had to put in the order, the noodles were amazing, soft and crunchy with bean sprouts!  Great way to end my meal and my nephew loved the noodles as well.  Next time i come, it may just be for the soy sauce chow mein! The service is pretty quick but can't say that for the dim sum carts.  But I'm gonna just look and see if there are more then one of the carts around before i have dim sum.",

The wait staff are friendly and pretty attentive.  They always keep my glass full.

    "text": "BLECH!  Let me start off by saying that my dad is the king of horrifying cliches.  Strangely enough, they've actually become a vital part of my vocabulary and somewhat useful.  1) If it sounds too good to be True, then it's probably too good to be True  $2.18 per dish for dim-sum?  2) you get what you pay for I was telling a buddy of mine that the price trumps the food AND the service.  After being away from the place for a month I forget how yucky the food is and the service is deplorable.   3) fool me once, shame on you.  fool me twice (4 times?) shame on me and i deserve to be ripped off the 3rd and 4th times.  We were there on Sunday at 11am and my wife remembered that the carts come out from the kitchen and go around counter-clockwise.  Her theory is that by the time they get to the north side tables, all the food will have been picked at and decimated.   She insists that we be seated as far from the main entrance (north side) as possible.  We get a table right up against the back wall closest to the kitchen.  We're sitting there for about 10 mins and no carts even pass by.   I'm like thinking, \"ok, dim sum is not really a fast food environment.  You stayed up way too late Saturday night and you stumble in for brunch.  It's supposed to be a slow, no rush, drink tea and have vibrant conversation with those around you.\" It was then that I started doing the math (not because I'm Asian.  I know what you were thinking).  I counted about 40 tables with 30 of them occupied.  I looked around to see what the MO of this place is.  A) there are only 2 carts being pushed around at any time (are they trying to lower overhead costs by owning only 2 carts?)  Instead of having several carts with the same items going different directions, it appeared that the cart pusher would only go back and fill her cart when it was empty.  So instead of just exchanging her empty cart for a \"pre-loaded\" cart, she actually disappears for about 3-5 minutes (and I presume she's in the kitchen loading her cart?)  B) since we had no food, I had time to count how many employees were on the floor and what their jobs seemed to be.  2 cart pushers, 3 bus boys (their job seemed to be water fillers, table clearers, and check retrievers) Fine, we all know that you can't seat people if there are no clean tables.  Then I counted 3 more (waiters?) with red vests going to tables and doing I don't know what (taking special orders?).    There was a man and woman that I assumed were the floor managers or owners that would be walking around doing \"managerial\" things like looking busy, answering questions, telling others what to do etc.  All the while I'm thinking \"more cart pushers (the food is kinda important here) and less whatever the other 8 people were assigned to do.  The 1 hostess/cashier was trying to seat people, take numbers, and take peoples money.  I felt somewhat sympathetic towards her because I overheard a customer say \"you gave us number 22\" and just seated another party when you called out \"22\".  She apparently gave two patrons the same number.  She quickly apologized to customer \"22b\" and out of frustration handed him a slip of paper with the number \"32\".  Needless to say, the customer was not at all pleased with the exchange and hotly protested \"uh, I don't think we want to go 10 places to the back of the line!!\"  It was getting really ugly and awkward but one of the other employees came to the rescue by immediately seating \"22b\" and things were restored to semi-chaos.  Oh, did I mention the food?  When the 1st cart came by our table, the pusher stopped by the table next to us and was fumbling with the little metal dishes and trying to cut the cheng-fun.  She seemed a little shaky and not at all concerned with serving the customers swiftly.  While she was trying to serve the other table, her cart was blocking the aisle and the other cart pusher had to stand there and wait until she was done. When the cart finally came to our table, we were so famished and anxious that we just started grabbing this and that in fear of never seeing the cart again.  We grabbed the following dishes: 1) shrimp cheng-fun:  Rubbery and kinda bland 2) chicken feet:  Great sauce, but the chicken was not tender and again....rubbery (perhaps leave it in the steamer longer?)  Funny thing is, we've ordered the same 2 dishes the past 3 times and it's the same....RUBBERY!   I guess you could say it's our fault for falling for the same rubber chicken trick each time. 3) Har-gow:  standard steamed pork dumplings, tasted pretty good (or was I just starving and grateful for anything that touched my chopsticks?) haha 4) Wu-tao-gock:  Fried taro was decent 5) Foo-jook-gien:  steamed pork with black fungus wrapped in bean curd skins.  was probably the best thing that touched our palates.  I know what your saying, why do you keep eating the dim-sum if the quality is mediocre at best and the service is non-existent?  PRICE!  it's like a mosquito drawn into a bug zapper.",

    "text": "I've been to a few other places for dim sum, so my opinion is somewhat biased.  For the record, I'm also your standard adventure-seeking gringo, inspired by Andrew Zimmern.  So, the wife and I decided to check out Mekong for their dim sum brunch.  Now, the prices are extremely fair.  There are 4 pricing categories for their dim sum, A, B, C, and D.  All choices A through C are priced at $2.18, while D is priced at $4.95.  Sodas are sold by the can, so we chose to have one can each of cola and we shared a pot of tea.  We're not picky, but we chose not to indulge on the lovely assortments of \"bun\"-type dishes that were presented to us.  Instead, we focused our attention and appetite on the pork, chicken, and seafood offerings.  And boy, we were not disappointed with the food!  Some of our treats included shrimp shumai, chicken and shrimp crispy spring rolls, pork spare ribs with black bean sauce (basically just a serving of pork fat with some bone in it, but incredibly tasty), taro cakes, sharkfin dumplings, and several others.  The servers were attentive, wheeling their cars around to every occupied table in the establishment.  Well, all the servers except for one.  I couldn't help but notice that one server seemed to avoid our table.  At first, I thought it was my imagination.  But then my wife noticed.  In fact, I watched her as she pushed her cart past us while making an effort to look in the opposite direction!  Of course, her cart had the items we were most interested in, so we were quite disappointed by her.  Were it not for that one server, we'd be giving our experience here 5 stars.  I purposely struck up a conversation with one of the other servers, a very pleasant young man, who was managing a cart that had the words \"beef organs\" on the side.  I asked him what he was offering, and when he described it to me, I could not conceal my interest.  He joked with us that he didn't think we'd be interested in his dish.  Well, he was half right....my wife didn't want anything to do with it!  That plate was very interesting.  It consisted of various organ meats, including tripe and liver that I could identify, and several others I could not.  All of the meats were very soft and tender, which is unusual for organ meats.  My wife even tried some (what a trooper).  We should all be glad I'm the one writing this review :)  Another of the dishes we tried was a flat noodle with shrimp.  Slippery devils, these were!  I was having such a hard time picking these up with chopsticks that one of the other wait staff was attentive enough to offer us forks.  He did it so politely that we joked with him to feign our offense, but we were actually quite thankful. The place settings do not include forks (an indication of their cultural authenticity, perhaps?)  Oh, be thankful that there is a menu with pictures of each offering.  Most of the servers do not speak fluent English.  But when you ask them what they are serving, they can point to the picture and you can read it yourself!  Overall, a fun experience.  Plenty of food, at bargain prices.  And before you leave, be sure to take a stroll through Mekong Plaza (the grocery store next door) and take in all the exotic tasties they have to offer.  It's not Lee Lee Market in its size or variety, but then it's also not as overwhelming.",

I was telling my wife that it had been a long time since I had a really good beef stew noodle soup.  She had a craving for yang chow fried rice, but we had ordered at the Grill.  (See separate review.)  We went to the Palace and ordered both items to go for the following day at home.  We live in Prescott Valley and there isn't a decent Chinese restaurant within 50 miles.  It was excellent!  The beef stew noodle soup was flavorful and the meat was quality.  I'm not a big fan of fried rice, but the one we brought home could change my mind.  They have a nice and spacious setting for a food court environment and there's no doubt we'll be back.",
