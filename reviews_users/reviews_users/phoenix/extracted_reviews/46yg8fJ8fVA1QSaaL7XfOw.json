    "text": "Just checked some of the reviews.  I totally agree with all the negative reviews....the food is marginal (it's okay if you don't want to drive further south for better, more authentic Vietnamese food!!!), but the service is absolutely HORRIBLE! Someone told me that Diner, Drive In and Dives was there and they gave them a good review...... Well of course! They probably pulled out all of the stops for them!!! However, maybe because of this review, they think they don't have to treat regular customers with respect and some courtesy!!!! This is a service oriented business and they really need to re-train their staff.  Maybe it's because the owner is just as bad and they just follow her lead.  She better get her act together, otherwise, when other Vietnamese restaurants open up closer to hers, she will definitely see a decline in her business!!! Hope she is reading and taking notes on all of her reviews!!!!!",

    "text": "Slanted Rice is a small more-or-less Vietnamese restaurant located in the Hilton Village outdoor mall, near its north end.  It has all of the ingredients it needs to be a great addition to the Scottsdale dining scene, except for what I call \"food design\".  For example, the Drunken Beef - basically filet mignon cubes with fried onions - had a big problem: the beef was tough and chewy, probably because they used the filet mignon tips, or possibly because the meat was not filet mignon at all.  The crispy rice bowl with chicken was a smallish bowl of cripsy rice, but it came with such a scarcity of chicken and vegetables that it wasn't much beyond the rice.  The chicken that was there was dried out.  There were other issues with the food as well.  The free broth served with the meal was bland except for a strange almost cinnamon taste.  The egg rolls were small and the filling was mushy.  Although prices at Slanted Rice are not high (our entrees were $16 and $20), the portions are small and the value is barely there.  On the other hand, service was good, the menu was interesting, and the ambiance was inviting, but that was not enough to make up for the food, which was passable at best.",

    "text": "A nice tiny restaurant in Scottsdale. They had plenty of options for vegetarians. However since the restaurant is small, it doesn't take that many customers to overwhelm the staff or the kitchen. My experience there was pretty good, we decided to sit outside in order to get some space. We felt that sitting inside when it's crowded makes you feel like everyone is sitting right next to each other. Not enough space. It took a while to get our food. However, it was delicious and we had no bad complaints. The second time we decided to go to this restaurant, we came in and almost every table except for two and the outside area was taken. It was already past 7:30. The waitress at the front informed us that it would be almost 40 minutes before we could even get our orders to the kitchen because of a large group that was there that night (maybe a group of 8-10). Since the restaurant closed at 9, we decided to leave and went to a different place. I recommend people try the food, but be prepared if the place is busy. It can cause the staff to go into overdrive and takes longer to get food out. Also don't get the spring rolls, they tasted frozen.",

I stuck to ordering a few appetizers to try as many plates as I could.    The vegetarian spring rolls were really good.  Crisp, fresh, and a nice dipping sauce on the side.  They normally come with two, but I asked to have them cut it into 3, and they were happy to oblige.    The sweet fish sauce chicken wings were generous portion wise, and were nice mix of flavors. Sweet, salty, spicy, and sour.  I was hoping it had more of a fish sauce flavor, because the sweetness overwhelmed the dish.  Avoid ordering the Brussel sprouts.  They overcharred the veggies, and while the fish sauce offered a balance to the smokiness, there's too many bitter charred pieces. I prefer them less well done.  We also ordered a Bun Cha Hanoi, which was the house specialty vermicelli. Charbroiled beef, pork patties, and shrimp with fish sauce vinaigrette and greens. Great mix of flavors.  Overall a really great food experience.  Service was great as well.  I'd come back if I visit the Phoenix Scottsdale area.",

My mom had been wanting to try Pha & she did some online research to choose Slanted Rice. We got seated right away, the place is small and super cute. We placed our drink orders; Thai ice tea & Thai iced coffee, which was forgotten. Water glasses filled a couple times & I reminded the waitress we still needed our drinks. She was very sweet and brought them promptly. The drinks were the best part of the entire meal.  My mom ordered the meatball pho and I ordered a tropical spring roll.  Tropical spring roll was 90% lettuce with a little bit of shrimp, avocado and mango. The rice wrap was chewy and the dipping sauce had no flavor. Mom's pho was bland, rice noodles mushy and she said the meatballs tasted old. I've had pha before, I tasted the broth and it was bland in comparison to   Pha I've had before. There was no chili oil to drizzle. I could not bring myself to try the meatballs, they just look like pale gray spheres floating in the bland broth with a weird mushy texture. We ordered tempura shrimp and garlic noodles as well as chicken pho to-go to bring home to some family members.  Comments from family on to-go dishes: Chicken pho broth flavorless & chicken tasted old/leftover/not fresh. Tempura shrimp & garlic noodles my son just ate the shrimp. He stated the garlic noodles were dry, chewy with no flavor & tasted as if it had Parmesan cheese in it. I took a taste & agreed. The bill was almost $80 and there was not 1 dish we liked. The drinks were delicious.  How unfortunate:(",

The one redeeming item was the firecracker shrimp. Very tasty. Not sure how they managed that...but it was still expensive.",

Too many other pho options in the Phoenix area that are better to make a return visit.",

The atmosphere is good with good music but I felt like I was in a high school locker room with the waitresses talking and gossiping together...they were talking pretty loud about their trips coming up and their boyfriends...obviously a place I could never take my parents to even they have been looking for a pho place. Not professional environment at all...food is solid 4 stars and the gossip makes the environment 2 stars...",

Lights were low and some cool chandeliers lit up the place just enough to give a romantic ambience. There were a few couples, not too packed for a Monday evening, although enough people.  Took about 5 minutes of nobody greeting us at the host stand that we just decided to walk to the bar to ask if we needed to seat ourselves. The bartender welcomed us and asked us to join him to watch the Grammies but we opted to sit at a table. In fairness, it was 8:05pm- and they close at 8:45/9.  A server came to give us menus and ask us for our order. All else with the service seemed fine- wasn't stellar, wasn't bad. We ordered shrimp and pork spring rolls, the tenderloin and vegetable pho and the combination pho. Took about 5 minutes for the rolls and another 7 for the Pho which was nice. Was served with the typical sides and hoisin along with 2 chile pastes.   The pho was Goooood!   The server took until we were paging for the meal to offer more water, which was unfortunate. I also wanted more lime but she didn't come back until I was close to being done. It was fine.  Overall good experience and good food. I would be back.",

They have this cool lighted tree branch sculpture/chandelier that was really mesmerizing.  The restaurant itself was not that large and somewhat narrow.  But it's still able to fit a lot of people, we came with a large group of 20+ people!  I wasn't that hungry, so I ordered the clay pot rice with veggies and tofu to share with my friend.  It came with soup and salad, and we were able to order extra soup and salad for $3 so each of us could have some.  The salad and soup were tasty, although the soup less impressive than the salad and the soup kind of had too many chives in it.  The clay pot rice was great!  I loved how the clay pot made some of the rice hard and chewy at the bottom of the pot.  The tofu and veggies were also good.  My favorite part was the mushrooms, I wish they had added more of those!  Overall great experience and I would come again, but I will note that I wish they had better ventilation.  With all of the steamy dishes being cooked in the kitchen, the place was getting smoky and hazy inside.  And when I went home my hair and clothes all smelled of food.",

When prices are this high for a bowl of pho, the experience should've been better. Hopefully when the owners push \"cool\" on this, they will also fix the problem.",

I ordered the shaken beef and loved the sauce, filet, and onions that come with the dish. The portions are very filling with the salad and broth that come with the meal. It's hard to beat the price with filet mignon at $16 for the lunch meal. I also tried some of my cousin's chicken clay pot meal and it was delicious as well.   The service was as good as the food. Our server Priscilla was friendly, prompt, and made sure we were taken care of the whole time. I've been spoiled with great Vietnamese food in San Diego, so it's nice to find a gem like this in the valley. I'll definitely be back, and the the only difficult part will be deciding which dish to try next!",

If you looking for authentic vietnamese meal,this is not the right place! And Btw the waiter never heard of \"Boba Tea\",right !!!Thanks but no thanks,not going there ever again.",

And now for the owners, which I give 0 stars. To our face they were extremely kind and welcoming. Had I been there on my own I would have walked out with a great vibe. But, my girlfriend happens to be fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese, and apparently the owners were too dumb to realize that an Asian customer might be able to speak their language. They were standing behind the bar, 5 feet away from us, and spent most of their time talking about the customers. They made multiple rude comments about the interracial couples in the restaurant, including some about the family sitting next to us. I won't go into other details, but let's just say I was pretty angry after hearing them.   (EDIT: While there I clearly heard a guy behind the bar telling another customer that he was from Shanghai, so I find it hard to believe that nobody there speaks Mandarin.)  There are better Vietnamese restaurants in Scottsdale...do yourself a favor and avoid these guys.",

Their food is on point. The garlic butter edamame, pho, and sizzling steak dish is to die for. There is also a shrimp and noodle dish I've seen that I'm dying to try on the next visit. The food is GREAT! We always enjoy our dinner/evening thoroughly when we visit. Good job Slanted Rice!",

The rice reminded of Persian rice or burnt rice in a good Paella. Once I the dish cooled down enough to eat I really enjoyed the bok choy, the shitake mushrooms and the sauce. The chicken was kind of plain, but that could be my fault. I bet the veggie version is worth trying.   The price was right too.",

Their fried chicken app was lower quality than fast food. Service was poor as well. Even after we reminded them that we didn't get our soup and salad before the main entree, they still brought it out with the main dish. The waitress seemed put off by my questions about the food before I ordered, not knowledgable and proud of what they make. The assistant food runners slammed dishes down in front of us hastily and practically ran away, which was odd because they weren't particularly busy. And is it just me, or does the name of this place sound racist?",

I was promptly seated and given water right away. Overall - the service was awesome.   With the lunch special, you get a soup and salad. The main course I got lemongrass chicken and a side of garlic noodles. The chicken was....horrible. It wasn't cooked all the way through or cooked correctly and had that chewy nasty texture in your mouth. I barely touched the chicken. The garlic noodles, on the other hand, were fire! They also hooked me up with a good \"grandma's spicy chili oil\" which was really good on the noodles.  I would give this place a second chance because of the service and the ambience...but I would stick to ordering vegetarian food. That chicken was absolutely disgusting.",

    "text": "We went to Slanted Rice a couple of weeks ago and had a very, very aggravating experience. One of us is a diagnosed Celiac and must eat gluten-free. A young lady (server) explains that a particular appetizer is GF because they use a separate, gluten-free fryer (and we explain all of the general concerns about gluten and cross-contamination).  We order the appetizer, thinking it would be safe. When the appetizer arrives, we ask again of another server to ensure it's GF, but this time, the fellow we speak to at the front says, \"no no, there is no gluten-free fryer, so you would have cross-contamination.\"  Of course, this causes us great alarm and we're up walking around the place trying to find the young lady and anyone else who will talk to us, to assess whether Slanted Rice really understands Celiac disease, or if their GF claim is not a serious one. Then we ask whether the pho is also GF because we ordered that and we are now in a serious predicament because the Celiac has also taken insulin (because of diabetes) so it is urgent that we eat immediately (don't want a blood glucose emergency). There is general chaos and then the fellow from the front, sensing that we are angry, alarmed, and pretty ticked off, starts to say that we shouldn't be eating out if we're so sensitive to gluten, the words he used were, \"Well, gee, if you're so sensitive to ... \" and we glared at him and he stopped talking, but the message that he was about to convey was obvious. On top of that, he was arrogant and insulting and I wanted to eject him from the restaurant. So, there is clearly a major, major disconnect at Slanted Rice and the staff do NOT know much about gluten-free food prep or Celiac from allergies to nuts, pollen, or anything else. A horrible experience all around. If you are Celiac and want to avoid a problem, avoid Slanted Rice.",

All in all I found some of the food we ordered a complete rip off, and the rest wasn't good enough to make me give an overall positive review.  The spring rolls (pork and shrimp) were $4 per roll. The rolls weren't large, nor were they so special they should be $4. Usually I expect to get 2 rolls for the same price.   We order the pho (beef) appetizer. I didn't eat it, but my friend said the broth was bland. They weren't impressed (we're from LA, I realize we're probably spoiled by great pho). My friend also ordered the vegetarian pho but didn't seem too impressed.   The one star of the night was the firecracker shrimp and garlic noodles. I have to admit, when they brought it out it didn't look very appetizing, but it really was tasty. I'd order it again.   Don't order the spring rolls -- order the firecracker shrimp. Expect a long dinner.  I paid $15 for my share of half an entree and the solitary spring roll.",

Simmered steak comes out sizzling like fajitas with onions, a side of white rice,  and a small dish of salt and pepper with lime. Guaranteed to fill you up and leave you satisfied.

I was very surprised by Slanted Rice Vietnamese Bistro a couple of weeks ago when a group of friends all landed from our various business trips for that particular week and met up for our monthly dinner outing to catch up with each other like we do someplace we haven't tried for drinks and of course , food!  Having grown up near the Bay Area, I know pho , PHO sho! , AND, have yet to really, REALLY, be blown away by any of the Vietnamese places here in the valley.  Slanted Rice is housed in the Hilton Village ; It's trendy ; chic and when you step inside, the vibe is cool; the mixology of drinks don't disappoint either. In fact, my Knees Bees Martini , a lovely libation of lavender honey gin, honey simple syrup, Yuzu, lemon and a smidgen of pomegranate will get you slanted , if your not mindful of your sips! It was stirred perfectly : not too sweet and not too tart and what I needed to end my week with. They have sake on tap; several brews, including Ichiban and Sapporo and a great, different drink menu with unique cocktails, as well as the usual beer and wines by the pint or glass.  Upon ordering our starters, we shared the Tom, (shrimp), Spring Rolls served with peanut sauce. It was a generous serving and I could seriously see myself grabbing an order to go for a later lunch since I love Vietnamese spring rolls so much. I loved that the waitress brought a selection of ramekins of sauces also for the dishes we ordered, as I like chile sauce on my rolls for some kick. The Slanted Pho is a great starter too, in fact, if you're like me and find the pho is always SO much to eat! , this is the perfect amount of Pho for the smaller eater: make it your main meal! A smaller bowl of the entree version.  My dinner entree was the Crispy Rice in a Clay Pot , (Com Tay Cam), with Shrimp. So unique! The entree comes out in a , ( you guessed it!), hot cast iron clay pot . VERY hot, in fact, to give the rice the crispness. The rice at bottom is topped with shiitake mushrooms , bok choy and the shrimp , (or the meat , seafood or veggie of your choice ), and this perfect amount of flavorful sauce. I don't think I would order this particular entree as a take out option, however, as the rice would, (as my leftovers did ), lose their crispy texture. My boyfriend , ( who became my fiancee on this night!) , ordered the entree Pho. Holy bowls! Maximum pho! This is one large bowl of Pho served ! He can never decide on one item so he got the combination of steak , meatballs , tenderloin, and flank steak. Loaded with broth and noodles and lots of meats .. and yes. He over ordered. Go figure. The Shaken Beef, ( Com Bo Luc Lac ),  is also a entree I'll try again. Tender, tender filet mignon served on a hot cast iron rectangular plate of sizzling onions and a side of freshly steamed rice. The Prawns with Garlic Noodles , ( Tom Nuong Va Mi Toi), was another favorite; a lot of large, nice prawns housed in these amazingly, garlic'd noodles. MMMMM.  All of our dinner entrees came with a bowl of scallion broth and small green salad with a miso ginger dressing. Needless to say, you won't leave Slanted Rice Bistro hankering for more. You will leave with leftovers if you were like us and over ordered to sample a bunch of different things.  I left this dinner outing, with a new blingy diamond on my left hand! The staff here was all in on it, ( as were our friends) and made the night fun and very special. IF I were to change anything , I would recommend later hours, particularly on weekends; this place has all the elements of a great bar so why not capitalize on that? 900pm closure on a Friday is just a tad odd to me .... But really, the food, unique menu and great bar and ambience give Slanted Rice a perfect 5 ...",

    "text": "We ate dinner here yesterday and were very happy with the experience. We ordered the chicken rice pot and the tenderloin pot. Both were really good and I didn't leave a single spec of food in the bowl. The rice that is at the bottom of the bowl was burnt and stuck to the bottom but this turned out to be an amazing positive, not negative. The burnt rice was super crispy and flavorful, not what you would have expected at all, so amazing! Also, we ordered the salt and pepper shrimp as an appetizer, excellent. The onions and jalapenos served with it were excellent as well.  Our waitress was very pleasant and provided excellent service. Make sure you get here early in the evening because the restaurant is very small and seating will be difficult. The only negative thing that I can say is they don't have high chairs for young kids. I have two children three and under, which this made things a little difficult.  Overall excellent food and service, definitely recommend it!",

The pho was pretty good being that its vegan and the vegetables (bean sprout and basal were not fresh at all, looked dead) and there were very stingy about it too, but I have had better pho and the price was too expensive $13.00 a bowl and in Houston a large pho is $7.00.",

    "text": "As lovers of good pho we have been trying to find a go-to restaurant in Scottsdale for a while now and Slanted Rice just became it. This review comes after three different visits and the food was on point each time. The restaurant is on the smaller side but has a cool atmosphere and on a nice night you can sit on the patio and enjoy. The wait staff is super nice and never minds accommodating a three year old with a healthy pho addiction as well!   The pho is the star of the show for us and their broth has the richness that only comes with a long preparation. One thing I really love about SR is that they also have a smaller portion pho on the appetizer menu! This gives you the opportunity to enjoy the soup and try one of the other many delicious menu items. So far we have tried the chicken salad with peanut dressing- great, the spring rolls- great, and the clay pot rice- great!   As you can tell there is a theme here of delicious food, top it off with a Vietnamese coffee or a cocktail from the bar and you wont regret it.",

I didn't want to try this place because I saw the prices and it was higher than what I was used to paying for authentic Vietnamese food. But then, we ARE in Scottsdale and we are paying for the service and ambience.   I ordered beef pho. I always taste the broth first before adding condiments. I like my broth clean. I guess it can't be too clean because of the beef. The noodles seemed over cooked. But when I added Sriracha, mint, bean sprouts, cilantro, jalapeno peppers, and lime...it all came together. I was enjoyed the pho, surprisingly. I didn't expect too much because of the restaurant being in Scottsdale. But I'll definitely come back. The have happy hour!",

We thought it was rude since we go there quite often.   They also had the AC on and it was 60 degrees and chilly outside so we moved to another table and had a girl wait on us.  She did okay but never cleared our plates - not after the appetizer or the dinner, or when she brought the ticket, we just kept stacking them up at the end of the table.  Or when she picked up the check or when she collected it - good grief again - poor service all around - this is basic waiting - clear off dirty plates before you leave the bill.   I did not feel like doing her job or reminding her what to do.  We felt we were treated poorly.  I also had to ask for a water refill - which is also amazing - we left knowing we had good food - love the shrimp soup and the spring rolls - I guess that makes up for the bad service.

    "text": "My Slanted Rice Review  The other day a friend who was sick asked if I could pick up some Pho, suggested Slanted Rice since it was recommended by someone I met months back who said it was best Pho restaurant he had tried locally.  Being that my friend and I came from Seattle, we were used to some very good Pho restaurants and quickly found that the local ones here in PHX/Scottsdale were far from the same level.  So here is my recent experience with Slanted Rice Vietnamese Bistro.  Upon arriving, I was greeted by 3 different employees over a 5 minute period. I explained to each one that I simply wanted to place an order to go, only the third employee told me to have a seat at the bar where I could place my order.  After sitting at the bar, the bartender moved some items out of the way and greeted me.  Two other patrons then came in and sat next to me who she greeted and started conversing with as well as provided them with menus ...... something I was not offered immediately.  After another 5 minutes she finally asked what I needed and when I said I wanted to place an order to go she started to offer me a menu, but I told her I knew what I wanted.  At that point, she started to talk with the other patrons again for another 5 minutes or so before turning back to me to ask what I wanted to order!!  So now that my order was placed, I focused on some taking care of some emails and other work while I waited. During this time, apparently my order was brought out in a bag ready to go, but was placed on the back counter near the other 2 patrons where it sat for over 10 minutes.  Having noticed that the other patrons who ordered after me received their food, I attempted to get the bartenders attention which took over another 5 minutes since she kept walking away from the bar area.  Once she finally came back, I asked if the bag was my order which it turns out it was .... and had been sitting on the counter for close to 15+ minutes at this point.  Now, I take my card out to pay and she tells me to wait for the waitress to come since she has to process the payment because food is on a different system.  At this point, the majority of other patrons have left while only a few people are sitting at the bar or some of the tables ..... yet the waitress seems unable to come to the bar to take care of my payment even though other people around me have paid for their meals.  I begin to tap my card on the counter in annoyance for another 10 minutes or more before the bartender finally goes to the waitress and asks her to take care of my order which she reluctantly does.  At this point, I am more annoyed by the fact that no one bother to recognize or apologize for the delays or even offered to discount my order now that it has gone cold with all of the waiting (over 30 minutes!).  I am not sure if this is how they handle their business all of the time or if it was just that day, but as someone who dines out regularly especially with all of the traveling I do, I found their customer service left a lot to be desired.  For stars, I am giving 2 rather than 1 since my friend said the Pho was really good and better than anything she has had since moving to AZ.  Am I open to giving Slanted Rice another try to show that this was a fluke? Not sure since I am really keen on the level of service and not just how good the food is.",

A few seats at the bar and two four-tops available. Hostess asked if we'd like to sit at the bar. No thank you, I replied.  She then hem-hawed for a few moments then said she'd \"have to check\". After being left standing there for a few minutes we decided to walk over to Houston's where we were seated immediately and had an excellent meal.  Slanted Rice could take lessons on customer service. Too many other good options around to be subjected to poor service.",

This place is hard to find, there's an obstruction when you're coming from the south end of the parking lot that doesn't allow you to see their sign.   A friend and I walked in, were greeted by a hostess who told us there was only seating available at the bar. I was wildly confused because I took one look at the seating in the restaurant and noticed they were at half capacity. I chalked it up to possibly having reservations on the way, but it was weird especially because we were there 90 mins and only half of those unfilled tables had patrons in them during the time we were there.   At the bar we were greeted by a bartender, who during our visit was extremely overwhelmed.   The good: the pork short ribs are awesome, so is the sauce that accompanies it. We also had sweet pork sweet rolls that may be one of the tastiest dishes I've had in years, the vegetables inside were incredibly fresh. We also shared the banh mi, which was in flatbread (different but not in a bad way), it was full of flavor and spice.  I ordered the pho with tenderloin and my friend had a clay pot with chicken. My pho was incredibly underwhelming, I couldn't even continue eating it and had them box it up. My friend really enjoyed his clay pot, I wish I got that as well.  There's a few more things on the menu I want to try so I will be back to evaluate them again. Based on the hostess thing and being relegated to the uncomfortable bar stools and seeing a large portion of the main seating not being utilized and the overwhelmed lone bartender, I gotta say the customer service needs work.  The food itself, especially the appetizers, warrant another try at the place.",

Set inside the Hilton Village shopping center behind the Chase Bank, there is seating both inside and outside with a cute shaded patio.   I had the tropical spring rolls and a Slanted size beef pho. The spring rolls had shrimp, vegetables, wonton strips, and mango. Everything was fresh and cool, a good contrasting juxtaposition with the hot beef pho. I enjoyed all the ingredients in the spring roll overall, but there were so little wonton chips in the roll that they didn't provide much of a texture difference in the dish. The miso vinaigrette dipping sauce and additional \"grandma\" chili sauce provided by my server were flavorful and great with the roll.  The pho was perfectly portioned for lunch. You'll find it in the appetizer section of the menu. It had a good ratio of beef to noodle, and I appreciated that the cilantro was a component placed on the side rather than chopped up into the soup. It was on the same plate with the requisite basil, bean sprouts and lime wedge. Overall I liked the pho. The beef was thinly sliced and very tender. The broth was more on the light side and didn't have a lot of depth or complexity of flavor as pho from other restaurants I've been to though.  Service was friendly and sweet from Priscilla.   If I'm in the area and craving Vietnamese food this is a good option to eat.",

So I called tonight to try to order some pho to go like I always do, and I am told they are not taking anymore to go orders tonight. At first I thought the guy on the phone was messing with me but then I realized he was being serious when he told me I could come in and sit at the bar instead. I have literally never heard of a restaurant that stops offering to go food because they are too busy that night (which was the explanation I got over the phone) -super disappointing! I really wanted my Slanted Rice pho lol",

The employee tried to up charge me by asking if I meant the combination pho and then stated there are two different types of steak for Pho Tai, which is incorrect according to their menu. My boyfriend unfortunately picked up the food and did not realize how skewed the price was before leaving as we were charged $35 for two bowls of pho tai?! We discovered the price was due to being charged for $4 vegetables per bowl which we did not request. Oh, and also, the steak in the pho was CUBED....do not waste your money here.",

The (burnt) rice on the edges of the clay pot were my favorite bites even though every bite of everything was delicious.  The rice did look burned but it was perfect tasting.  The clay pot came with soup and salad. Soup and salad were both very nice but not amazing.  The egg rolls came with a sweet vinegar liquid which is a perfect combination with the eggrolls.  We used the lettuce to wrap our eggrolls in and help to bring more of the yummy liquid into the mix.  It was a bit pricey but the service and atmosphere were both spot on.  Our bill was $35 (before tip) for the 2 items mentioned and one rum and coke.  We enjoyed it very much and we will return.",

Drink selection is very nice and I'm glad they support local breweries. The best part is that the things you wouldn't typically find in a Vietnamese restaurant have been knock outs! ie the chicken wings. Everything has a certain flair so it stays True to the concept.

The salt and pepper calamari gets it 1 star tasted like frozen fish sticks. The shisito peppers 2 stars just ok. The pho was 4 star which was very good and flavorful nice portion as well. For dinner the wife and I ordered the garlic noddles and prawns and they were 2 star nothing special very bland and noodles were over cooked. We also ordered the Crispy Rice in a Clay Pot- Tenderloin that was 1 star it tasted like cheap beef teriyaki from grocery store. I really wanted to like this place because the service was great and so friendly. I would back for pho but nothing else",

Sat down, did not get food for an hour and 20 minutes tables around us had sat down, ate, and left before we even got our food. It was obvious they had forgotten. We heard every excuse from the printer was down to anything else. How about just admit you forgot to put the order in and apologize? So after the long wait there was a hair in the salad. When we told our server about the hair his reply was \"Well who do you think did it?\" FYI we don't care WHO or WHY there was a hair in the salad just fix it. After returning the food there was no apology and instead of asking what we would like instead the server rudely hit the check on the table about 10 minutes later. They seemed to be understaffed probably due to poor ownership/management. Another note to management, I have received food with hair in it and I have actually returned to the restaurant because they have good service and they HANDLED the problem. That was not the case here. Skip this restaurant there are plenty others.",

On top of that a bowl for $12-14 dollars is way too much. Do yourself a favor n go to a more authentic place for cheaper. I get that this place is probably catering more to Caucasians and its fancier but the taste doesn't have to compromise. Spring rolls were ok can't go wrong when things are fried. We're from out of town so I wouldn't know whats better here in scottsdale.",

However If the food is good than who really cares?  Two words: shaken beef.  It really is amongst the most delicious dishes I've had in recent memory.  Filet beef, onions, and a great sauce (that next time I will order extra for).  The wings with garlic were also a major hit as were the garlic noodles.  We ended up ordering a second side of it mid meal.  Was not a fan of the pho or the crispy rice dish, but now I know what to get because the rest was phenomenal.  Staff was great, food was great, and I will be back ASAP as well as recommend to others.",

They offer a special lunch menu, but you can order off the main menu as well. There are so many choices from appetizers, salads, spring rolls, sandwiches, rice dishes, and dinner entrees. We had a difficult time deciding as we watched orders being delivered to other tables around us. Everything coming out of the kitchen looked amazing and fresh! Hubby and I decided to split two different spring rolls -- the Shrimp and Pork with peanut sauce and the Fried Tofu with peanut sauce. I have to say, they really know how to do peanut sauce!  Hue, one of the owners, also brought out some miso sauce to try as well with the rolls, and that was delicious as well!  Definitely many more rolls in our future.  We split the Crispy Rice in Clay Pot with chicken as our main entree. It was hands down the most tasty rice dish I have ever had. (And I am not a fan of rice to begin with!)  It also comes with a large bowl of soup and a good-sized salad. Definitely enough to share, but next time, I will order one just for myself. I almost inappropriately licked the bowl!!!  The owners Hue and Ty are very gracious and welcoming. I have already decided to have another lunch here later this week, and can't wait to bring in another group of friends for dinner so that we can experience more of everything!!!",

I'll never come back here again.  When I entered, I was never greeted. So I sat myself at the bar. The bartender never saw us and never greeted us and said she would be right with us. Instead, she finished what she was doing and a few minutes later asked if we needed a water. What a slap in the face. We ordered two bowls of pho and spring rolls. It literally took 30 minutes to come out!! For pho? The broth is already made! Geez. I've never waited that long before. To add insult to injury, when it finally came out, my bowl was luke warm; not even hot. As a matter of fact, the rare beef never fully cooked in my broth. It stayed pink and rare and mushy. And the noodles were over cooked and mushy too. I bet they had my bowl sitting on a counter with piping hot broth for 15 minutes. And it continued to cook my noodles. But then it cooled down. They probably dropped the steak in lated and served me a bowl of cold soup. If you're going to charge $5 more per bowl than other Vietnamese restaurants, maybe you should either serve it hot or have amazing service. What a bust. If the owner knew this was going on, I know he'd have someone's head for it",

Would be five stars, but I had the Pho and that is a minus. I would suggest that they just take it off the menu and maybe offer some other dishes like crispy noodles.   Everything else we had, spring rolls, the rice clay pot, and a grilled chicken over rice was excellent. The service was good and pretty knowledgeable of the menu and the atmosphere was calming without being too stuffy. It's a small space, so reservations may be needed during busier times.",

    "text": "I'm so confused by all the positive reviews of this place maybe it was an off day but I was just not impressed... and frankly super irritated.  So, I pull into the parking lot based off of my smartphone directions, the restaraunt is located in a long strip mall/shopping plaza. I gave them a call to find out specifically where they were located.  I was parked near the Starbucks which is smack dab right in the middle of the strip mall.    I called and asked \"I'm at the Starbucks, where are you in relation to the Starbucks?\" The girl who handled my phone call tells me that they're at the end of the complex.  Oooookay.  I replied, is that the north end or the south end? She said to go right from the Starbucks.   Well depends on whether your are facing east or west at the Starbucks.  I tried to get more information from her but it was clear that she was directionally challenged.  We ended up walking to one end - not there and then to the other end... found it!   Typical of this location and area the place was decorated nicely and very modern and clean looking. They had a nice small patio outside and my son chose to have us sit there.    Food:  This is what we ordered: Salt & Pepper Calamari $10 Spring Rolls Pork & shrimp with peanut sauce $4 Pho Thai $12 Pho Meatballs $10 (I think) Thai Iced Tea $4  Salt & Pepper Calimari - it's Calamari steak, breaded in panko and deep fried.  It's served with fried jalapenos and onions and a spicy mayo dipping sauce.  The sauce is what makes this dish decent.  The calamari is nothing special, very similar to something that was supplied from a frozen food company.    Pho Soups:  Broth was meh - mediocre at best.  It lacked the depth of flavors that I've had elsewhere. The Pho herb & sprouts plate was sufficient but my cilantro looked like it had been frozen and thawed and given to me.  Eeeeek.    Thai Iced Tea: Came pre-mixed, made me think that they didn't make it here since it wasn't layered.  Spring Rolls:  This was supposed to be an appetizer but was served to us AFTER we were almost done with our pho and AFTER I told the waiter not to serve it to us since we didn't get it as an app.  Service:  Service was ok but has plenty of room for improvement.  1.  They forgot my spring roll appetizer, after we had been already partaking of the soup. The waiter asked if we got it, I said no and told them no need to bring it out now and they did anyways with no apologies.  People, take some advice, it COSTS you nothing to apologize.  It's FREE.  It's just a word that has value but costs you nothing from your own wallet... use it when it needs to be used.  When I first started this review it had 2 stars... once I checked my leftovers... I took it down to one because I can't even re-eat it... (see below)  So we ended up leaving with lots of leftovers, the calamari app, a full order of spring rolls and our soups.  I get home this evening, unpack our food and am completed frustrated to find that they didn't include the peanut dipping sauce for the spring rolls NOR the calamari dipping sauce for the calamari.    What a waste of my hard earned money, I recommend that you don't waste  yours.      If you're looking for some great Vietnamese fare, definitely check out my other reviews of other restaurants in the valley that will KNOCK your socks off without the cost.",

He then let us order pho and salad for the table when that comes with each dinner. When we were surprised to receive a second soup and salad he said \"it tells you that on the menu with no apologies. We then received our meals, 3 clay pots and our friends were not made without sauce, as requested, and had to be sent back. Again, no apologies and they began to turn up the lights and asked to remove our flowers from the table. Pitiful experience and we were not the only ones left at 9:30 pm when they close at 9:00. It was SO obviously poorly managed and an unpleasant experience at best. Food was okay, I have had much better, and we enjoyed ourselves despite their lack of effort and apologies. I will never return again.",

    "text": "Update: We went in again for dinner and had a horrible experience.   We decided to order a bunch of dishes so we could try more things and so we could have some leftovers to take home since we loved it so much last time. So we ordered the pork spring rolls, crispy ribs, lemongrass chicken, a shrimp and a steak clay pot, and a side of lemongrass stir fry veggies.   We started out okay with the pork spring rolls. Then we got the ribs and lemongrass chicken, neither of which were anything special. Just fried meat with dipping sauces that lacked flavor.   Then we got the clay pots. We both ordered one this time because we loved them SO much last time, but these clay pots were nowhere near what we had previously. Last time, the rice was buttery, rich, and incredibly crave-worthy, but the chicken was dry. I asked our server what she recommended since the chicken was dry last time, and she made it sound like the chicken is always dry in the clay pots (you'd think they would do something about that), so she recommended the shrimp instead. The shrimp was definitely better than the chicken. However, this time the clay pot came out WAY hotter than last time (inedibly hot) and half of the rice was burnt, and the other half was not crispy at all on the bottom. If you haven't had this dish before, the rice typically has an amazing golden crust on the bottom that's slightly crispy and super flavorful. The burnt rice gave the whole dish a burnt flavor. Also, this time the mushrooms were rubbery and completely inedible. This was the same on both clay pots that we ordered. That's $40 of food that was not enjoyable.   The lemongrass stir fry veggies were also disappointing. It tasted like water-logged vegetables were tossed in a sugary sauce with a hint of lemongrass. Not good. I feel like all of the food here is unnecessarily sweet when it could be salty, savory, sour, and so many other flavors.   We told our server about our food and she said that one other chef is definitely better at making clay pots than the chef that was working that night. She also said that other customers had complained about their clay pots being unevenly cooked, too. But the kicker - she said this in a way that made it seem like it was normal and happened all the time, and she did not offer to do anything to improve our experience (i.e. allow us to order something else, take one of the dishes off of the bill, get a manager, etc.).   When she came back with our check, she apologized for the food and we said we were very disappointed and wouldn't come back unless the other chef was there (who she said was named Manny). Then she told us the chef working that night was her fiance! That made us feel like she wasn't offering to fix the problem because she didn't want her fiance to get in trouble.   Our check showed the full balance for all of the food we ordered. After paying and on our way out, I asked to speak with a manager. She said there wasn't one on duty, that they were short a manager and it was just her, and the owners were not there.   This experience was so completely opposite from our first visit that we likely won't be back. The difference in the quality of the food was the difference between one of the best meals and one that never would have brought us back to the restaurant. And the service was awful. She even told us she doesn't have the authority to take anything off of the bill. I don't understand how the owners could be so careless to leave someone in charge without the authority to fix issues, nor the desire to do so.   We recently went out to dinner to another restaurant, which was a $50 bill compared to our $100 bill here, and we remarked that we could not believe we spent so much on such a mediocre meal at Slanted Rice.",

I ordered the beef pho and my friend and I shared the other items. My friend and I shared the pork egg rolls and shaken beef.  The beef pho broth was a bit on the sweeter side but it all worked out once I added some hot sauce to it. The shaken beef was very tasteful and it was nice to be able to order the lunch special version of it. The egg rolls were good and it was nice to share a variety of food.  The service was decent since it took some time to get certain things. I've been a server and I've had good and bad days so I'm not going to be too critical on that.   The restaurant has a nice outdoor patio if you would like to eat outside. It wasn't too busy when I went here so there was plenty of seating available. The prices were a bit high from what I am used to paying in Sacramento but it is what it is. I would definitely come back here for my shaken beef and pho fix.   I also ordered the wine special which was $10 for a half bottle of wine. The special was for La Crema and it was delicious!   It's also cool to know that Guy Fieri came by here also!",

The clay pots and pho are good too! If you want a side of pho, they have smaller portions compared to getting their full sized entree portion. I've taken my friend here (who doesn't typically love Asian restaurants) and she loved it so much she went back with her sister the same week!

    "text": "I would give this place 0 stars, if I could. They barely deserve 1 star because of their awful customer service. One pompous waiter with an accent is the worst offender. The first time my bf went here, Julian ignored him until my bf went to the bar. The second time we got an Asian bartender who was okay. We went there about two more times, always sitting at the bar since table service was lacking. Unfortunately, the fourth time we sat at the bar, the bartender was talking to other female servers and paying more attention to their conversation than the bar. I could hear the girls giggling and talking about doing Cocaine. I understand that people do drugs, but the fact that they discussed it so blatantly at work is not appropriate. They were more focused on dimwitted conversation than their jobs.                                                             So the next time we sat, we tried a table again. The restaurant was practically empty, and nobody came to help us. No one even sat us, and nobody brought water or said anyone would be with us. I could see the employees standing and chatting in the back completely oblivious. When we walked out, my bf was so upset I hung back to say something. The egocentric Julian, denied that we had been waiting there, did not apologize for anything and acted like he was god's gift to women. I honestly don't know what this guy's issue is but he's clueless and definitely should not be a server. He has no idea how to handle customers or even say the right thing. He just has \"slime ball\" written all over him. I have never met a more rude server.      As for the food, it's mediocre. I've had way better Vietnamese food at many other places in AZ.                                                                        I love spring rolls and the ones here are bland. I also tend to gravitate towards lemongrass and curry dishes. The curry was just like any other curry I've had elsewhere. And the lemongrass dish was a huge disappointed. It did not taste authentic at all, more importantly it wasn't good. The garlic noodles that come with the prawns are oily and slathered in too much butter. The noodles were stringy and lacked flavor. Of course this is not the worst Vietnamese food I'll ever have, but it definitely is nothing special. The only thing I ever liked was the calamari.              The pho at Tea Light Cafe is just as good as this one and there is actually real customer service at Tea Light Cafe. Imagine that! Customer service at a restaurant!                                   I am speaking from experience as I have been a server. I know it is not an easy job but whoever is hiring these \"employees\" needs to step up their game or clean house. The awful service is the main reason I am never going back here again.                                                       But, if you decide you're okay with rude servers talking about their drug habits, get the calamari; it's the only thing you could be happy with ordering.",

Faves: Pho - mandatory hangover cure.  SO MUCH better than Noodles Ranch.  There is actual complexity in the broth.  If you're a broth junkie like me, their scallion broth that comes with the entrees (and you can order separately as well) is the same as their pho broth.  Garlic Noodles - Such an genius idea!  Fragrant but not overbearing garlic flavor and some added mmmMMMmmmm with a sprinkle of cheese.  Great with sriacha if you're into spice.  Clay Pot Rice - I really wish they did this with Chinese sausage but ehhhhhh... What you're really looking to get here is that crispy rice goodness all around the clay pot.  DO NOT GET THIS TO GO.  You will miss out on the crispiness!  What you want to do is to mix everything together so you get all of the flavors of the chicken and mushrooms and sauce and the awesome crunch texture of the rice sprinkled in.  YUM.  Sooooo... not to be a Noodles Ranch hater, but seriously drive the two miles north and come try this place (all you Colonial Grand dwellers - looking at you).  You won't regret it!",

I think this is another restaurant that has cut back on staff because of the minimum wage increase.  Since we haven't been here before, we don't know if this has slightly increased food prices, as well.  We had an appetizer and two entrees all of which were excellent. Come for the food if you don't mind waiting.",

I don't know what was more tasty the lightly breaded shrimp or the sauce. Since the firecracker shrimp received rave reviews my husband ordered that. Well I convinced him to because I was afraid it would be too spicy for me, but it wasn't. My husband was obsessed with the garlic noodles on that dish!  This place is a little more pricy than a traditional Pho establishment but it's definitely nice to splurge. Get the pepper shrimp!",

The Bahn mi had a modern twist with a pita wrap instead of hoagie and a nice lightly spicy mayo. Even with the reduction in bread it was large and filing and the pork was cooked perfectly.  And the plum ice cream and bananas were so amazing that even though I was already full, I had to finish them.  The staff were really nice and very attentive without hovering.  Plus the happy hour prices are insanely low. I felt like I was robbing them. ...but no complaints.",

    "text": "I decided to come here on a weekday for some lunch. Of course I really wanted to try their Pho noodle soup and I also ended up getting takeout in the process which was the grilled pork with steamed rice dish. There was also some salad included which was a nice surprise. While the Pho noodle soup was decent, the rice dish was a bit disappointing. It could just be the one that I ordered but there was no fish sauce and some hot soup would have really been appreciated. Also the portions were not very big for what I ordered compared to some of the other Vietnamese restaurants that I have been to. This was mainly True for the rice plate which was much smaller than expected.  Looking through the reviews on here I would have to agree that while this place has decent Vietnamese food, there are more authentic and cheaper options if you head elsewhere and the prices are quite high for what you get. I believe I spoke with the owners who are really nice people and had a genuine interest to get to know me so that's good. I also really liked the atmosphere of this place but sadly I'm not sure if I'll return due to the reasons that I mentioned.",

Slanted Rice has a very chill and welcoming vibe upon walking in. I immediately found the service to be very fast and friendly.   I ordered the combination pho, and it ranks up there as one of the better bowls I've had. There was a good and balanced about of meat, and noodles, and a generous side serving of your typical pho garnishing and sauces (basil, bean sprouts, hoisin etc). Broth was very hearty, but not too oily, as I've found at some places. My only \"gripe\" might be that it's a bit pricey in comparison to some places (but I'm a poor college student, so lots of things are pricey for me lol)- the combo pho was $14, but I'd honestly get it again.",

On this most recent visit, the girlfriend and I showed up about 30 minutes prior to closing on a weekend.  We were seated quickly and, being a weekend, it was time to get our drink on... so we ordered the Lychee-infused vodka cocktail.  The flavor was good, but it did not seem to have much alcohol it in... although that all changed once I took a bite of the lychee at the bottom of the drink - it was like a eating a shot of vodka!    For my meal, I opted for a couple of appetizers.  The shrimp and pork spring rolls were very good.  The rolls ended up being a little messy, but that peanut sauce... oh that peanut sauce - soooo good!  The banh mi wrap was a creative and awesome take on the traditional  banh mi!  I could literally eat this wrap every single day!  The pita wrap is perfect... and a perfectly delicious compliment to this banh mi!    Already looking forward to my next visit to Slanted Rice!  *****FIVE STARS*****",

If you're looking for authentic Vietnamese food this isn't it. It's more of an American fusion, which I wasn't aware if they are?  I do not recommend ordering pho from this place. They do not have condiments for the pho like hoisin sauce, sriracha, chili paste; none. They only serve it with a plate of bean sprouts, basil leaves and a slice of lime.  I ordered the chicken pho and the broth had a weird herbal taste to it, not in a good way.   Their charbroiled rice plate didn't have much flavor either. The pork in the dish was very dry and tough which was quite disappointing.   The one order of spring roll literally is one spring roll cut in half, quite pricey. It wasn't good either. The end of my spring roll got to my table dry.. almost too dry it was hard.   One thing I would only come back for and reorder would be their Salt and Pepper Calamari. Full of flavor and just the right amount of crispy-ness. Not too salty either.",

    "text": "When I have Vietnamese food on the brain, I can't be stopped. My brain orders: need spring rolls + a huge bowl of vermicelli, veggies, tofu and herbs in my belly now!  We arrived about an hour before closing and were able to get a seat on the patio, which was quite nice. The menu features a fair amount of veggie-friendly dishes, but just ask if you're worried that something might contain fish or oyster sauce because it doesn't always clearly indicate. For example, anything containing lemongrass sauce is not vegetarian as it contains oyster sauce. So, no Brussels for me, sadly, but hey, when there's a vegetarian spring roll with crispy won ton, asparagus and avocado w/ miso sauce, there's no reason to be sad about this.   Normally I'm all about the bun, but I couldn't pass up one of the crispy rice bowls (not seeing it on the online menu but I swear they have these). This was exactly what I needed, a cast iron pot filled to the brim with bok choy (my favorite!) and other veggies, plus tofu and loads of that slightly charred crunchy rice. This is one of my favorite things to eat and this did not disappoint.   If I lived in Phoenix, no doubt Slanted Rice would be on my regular rotation. Check it out when you're looking for both healthy and robust food!",

My love for Vietnamese cuisine runs deep and it's even better when said Vietnamese eatery offers an abundance of vegan and veggie options given my shellfish/seafood allergy. Lucky for me, the pho broth here does not feature fish sauce and it was chock full of delicious veggies and tofu. I also enjoyed the salted edamame appetizer and vegetarian tofu spring rolls with peanut sauce.   Located in a strip mall with an abundance of parking, I could see this place being my go-to if I lived in the area. They offer both indoor and outdoor seating, coconut water, Vietnamese coffee and Thai iced teas. You know, all of the important stuff. Overall, a very delicious visit.",

Full disclosure, my boyfriend and I came in very hungover and we just needed some pho as comfort food. I ordered a small pho ga (chicken pho) and he ordered a large pho tai. The pho ga was pure salvation. It was very, very small but it was the perfect portion for me at the time. Boyfriend enjoyed his large pho tai a little less (I think he said it was missing more onions and other herbs), but then again, we're spoiled by the fact that we normally get our pho from Little Saigon in OC.   The restaurant feels really fancy. It's decorated so beautifully and looks very modern with the classy bar. There's also the option to sit outside in the small patio. Is it the most authentic-tasting Vietnamese restaurant? I'm not sure about that. But it's definitely a gem if you're looking for Viet food in Scottsdale.",

A few other Reviewers mentioned, the flavors of the food was off, in a weird way,  and I agree. to me it seemed  \"white washed\" for a Caucasian palate.   I ordered the garlic noodles with prawns. The seasoning on the prawns was good, sadly, the star of the show, the garlic noodles was an oily, mushed mess, noodles were cold, (not made to order) and disappointing. Maybe I caught this place on a bad day.",

    "text": "So...three nights ago...I was minding my own business watching Triple D and saw this place that 1. was close to home and 2. had pho and my yelp antennas went up!!!! \"umm yes count me in\" I thought,  I swiftly  added it to my \"places I need to go\" collection and now here I sit...(well technically there I sat...lol)    So basically Guy Fieri sent me, I should have told them that when I walked in and maybe I wouldn't have waited over 20mins for my starter?! and another 15 from my apps... but via ease dropping on the couple two tables down it was a long wait kinda night. When we got there they were siting I assumed they had finished and just enjoying each others company turns out they too were waiting. None the less I wasn't in a huge hurry and little baby (my youngest) was keeping me entertained.  I ordered spring rolls, crispy rice and shrimp. Come to find out two orders of spring rolls is actually really 2 spring rolls... so if there a lot of you I'd skip this app... plus as you can see they were mostly lettuce. I had a vegetarian with fried tofu and a miso dipping sauce and little baby had fried shrimp both were fried really nice and crispy! Okay so little baby said \"Guy was right these shrimp gave me a first class trip to flavor town!!\" lol when we were leaving she told our server to tell the chief \"these are the best shrimp I ever had\". NEEDLESS TO SAY SHE LOVED IT!!!  I ordered the crispy rice in a clay pot....uuuummmmm it was good the mushrooms are very earthy so if that's not your thing skip them, the rice was crispy almost burnt tho.....but I think that's how its supposed to be?? and I wish I had bigger plate to mix it in I also added jalapenos  but I honestly think I has pho envy so the whole time I was eating I was wishing it was pho... sad I know... next time I'm gonna go for what I know and have pho fo sho.....lol BBBBBUUUUTTTT when we were waiting to pay I heard someone order brussel sprouts, I've never had them before but I remembered Guy saying they were good so I ordered some to go....once we got settled in the car for the trop home I told little baby to hand me one so I could taste them while they were hot and  I kid you not they were AMAZING!!! I don't know what kinda sauce they used but it was yummy and we ate them all before when got home and that's why there isn't a picture.",

We had a bunch of their vegetarian items from potstickers, garlic edamame, spring rolls, and pho which were all excellent.  I had their grilled chicken and rice plate which was cooked great with just the right amount of burnt places to make the fish sauce balance things out.  My only complaint is that they did not have a high chair for my daughter so my wife had to hang on to her in the booster seat for the entire dinner so she wouldn't slide under the table.  Would recommend skipping the large chain joints in this area to eat at this place.",

They were crunchy, meaty, and just the right amount of fat. Next, we both ordered the combination pho. The portions are a bigger than my favorite pho place (Saigon Pho) but then again, the cost is a bit higher. Nevertheless, the broth is flavorful, and they give you a lot of meat. Both the hubby and I enjoyed the food and the ambiance here. We will be back!",

It was fairly busy and patio was full but we were immediately greeted and sat, the server was attentive and food came fast and hot, it's a very clean and inviting dining room with a cool funky bar, we decided we would try a variety of dishes as long as we made the drive out, we tried 6 all spot on, with the exception of one (pot-stickers) little to crispy for us, my wife is Chinese and prefers steamed dumplings as do I, but if you like fried they had nice flavor. The sizzling filet is amazing and the garlic butter wings are a close second as was the fried pork rolls raped in lettuce and mint.   I've read here that some people think this place is a little pricey $ But if the general public knew what it cost to just keep the doors open these days with Licensing, Permits, Inspections, Insurance, Utilities now add in Food cost and the ridiculously high cost of rents today this place is  reasonable for what you get. I know this first hand as all these expenses is what drove me out of my brick & motor location and into a Food Truck. Our bill for 6 dishes was only $55.  But the real Gem of this place and why it gets 5 stars from me is the owner Hue she is as charming as they come, with as busy as they were she never stopped table touching wile taking orders and delivering food, she came to our table many times asking if we were ok or needed anything wile refilling our water glasses and checking to see if we were enjoying are food, when bringing the bill out she sat with my wife and looked up her favorite Chinese restaurant online to recommend to us. Who does that? That's what I call customer service in a time where there is far to little of it. Will definitely be back. I don't post a lot mainly due to lack of time but this place warrants a little of my time to pass my experience on to you..",

Outstanding service, ambiance   and fresh, delicious food prepared and served in a most appealing way is what you will find there! The lemongrass roasted brussels are a perfect start! So flavorful and roasted with an amazing lemon flair! Hubby had the shrimp rolls served on a stick with a tasty dipping sauce and really enjoyed this appetizer as well! We also sampled the vegetarian and shrimp pho and fell in love with the freshness and flavors of this wonderful soup.   I chose a cold rice vermicelli noodle dish with veggies, fresh mint, cucumbers, lettuce, peanuts and a variety of spices and sauces that you can add and then toss the whole thing together! One word- Amazing!!! I was in total vegetarian Heaven the whole time we were there! My husband had the charbroiled pork and rice which was quite tasty and he really enjoyed it.   The owner came out to chat with us and gave some suggestions on where to visit during our stay, she was adorable and very gracious. We are so glad to have visited this hip, immaculately clean and very well managed spot in beautiful Scottsdale! Of course we are on a quest for more Vietnamese food now that we have returned to Florida and I surely hope that they can stand up to the Slanted Rice!",

We started with the Dragon Lady Spring Roll. It was mild in flavor and mixed textures perfectly.   I really wanted to try one of their shrimp dishes but opted for the Chicken Crispy Rice Clay Pot. Eating this was an experience! It took a little too long to cool down for a quick lunch, so I probably would recommend it for dinner. The flavor a were phenomenal and the crispness of the rice really made the cool down wait worth it.   Overall, I had a great dining experience. I'm excited to try more on their menu and hope there will be lasting power for Slanted Rice!",

The music is never loud or obnoxious like some places, it's very relaxing and chill and the look of it is too. It's very clean, the servers are all very nice and professional (yet personable), and it's the best pho/Asian food in town. And if you're not a big eater (like myself) and you're wanting to order pho I would recommended getting the \"slanted sized pho\". All of the different kinds of meats are offered for this size and the serving size is about the size of an average soup bowl. It's what I get every time and it's always the perfect amount of food, especially with edamame as an appetizer (the lemon grass edamame is super yummy!!).",

    "text": "The food here is amazing. I came to Slanted Rice last week with my mom who had always raved about the food, and I wanted to see for myself. We arrived in the late afternoon and sat outside. Our waitress was so nice and attentive and gave us her suggestions for her favorite dishes. We started off with the Dragon Lady spring roll, which was great. For my main dish, I got the Pho with chicken, which was so refreshing! They gave me a large variety of options such as mint, jalepenos, and sauces to add to my pho. My mom got the shaken beef, which was AMAZING. This was probably one of my top 20 favorite dishes of all time. The beef was sweet and perfectly flavored and came in a skillet on a bed of onions. Definitely visit the Slanted Rice next time you are in the mood for Vietnamese food, and make sure you try the shaken beef.",

The bartender was a young gal who was about as OCD as I was. She never touched a bare straw with her fingers and made sure we were taken care of.   There are lots of people that wrote the service was slow, and that may have been the case, but I was busy catching up with my friend so it didn't bother us too much. I've never been to such a \"upscale\" Vietnamese restaurant. The ambiance was great, the food was delicious and the prices were reasonable.   If I'm back in the area, I'd definitely come back for another visit.",

That was not a tip I see this as theft.  I hope the owner/manger checks these reviews  there is a blood heavy girl waitress that needs to be fired.  I have left a message for owner/manager.

    "text": "We went to Slanted Rice this past Friday night. I was excited to go knowing that one of the owners was once the chef at Banzai, a sushi place I used to love on Northern and 12th street (now closed). First off, this place isn't your typical Vietnamese restaurant. It's a little bistro style restaurant with a hip atmosphere and a diverse and edgy menu. We started with lemon grass wings and lemon grass brussel sprouts. The wings were fantastic and the person at the table who hates sprouts was the one who insisted on a second order! For dinner we had the steak and the chicken. The entrees came with a small soup and salad, the soup was pho of course. I frequent Vietnamese restaurants around the valley and I have to say their pho was the most flavourful I've ever had. The steak and chicken were both absolutely delicious. I fairly sure I'm going for the steak again on my next visit. I had a cocktail recommended by the staff, don't know what it was called but they said it was the house signature drink, it was made with Jameson and blueberries. I definitely recommend trying one if you go, it was great. I can't comment on price as we were guests and were treated, but the menu prices looked very reasonable. Even though this place is not near where I live, it's worth the trip, I'll be heading back very soon.",

We had brussel sprouts  and edamame a la lemongrass ... both were very sweet and sticky.  As my main, I had the clay rice pot with tofu and veggies.  The tofu was disgusting - chewy and tough - like it had been cooked and then microwaved to heat it up.  I mentioned it to our waiter who brought the owner over.  She explained that they use firm tofu and proceeded to tell me about the different kinds of tofu.  No apology was offered, nor was the dish offered to be removed from the bill.  She didn't apologize.  I asked for rice with veggies which took forever to come out.  The dish had about 2 cups of rice and 1/2 cup of veggies - again, smothered in a sweet sauce.  My friends ordered tofu and chicken - both said they were spongy, touch and chewy.   I eat tofu all the time and have never tasted tofu so poorly prepared.   Totties, Malee's on Main and Saigon Nights all have delicious tofu.  NONE of them serve chewy, spongy,  tofu.  The soup that come with the meal was salty.  The salad was basically wilted lettuce.  The restaurant knew it was my birthday.  They didn't offer us dessert. - not that I was looking for a free-bee - they never even brought a dessert menu giving us a chance to order.  All around I had a very poor experience.  And, the prices were extremely high.  Rice with a few veggies $14.    Seriously!?

    "text": "I was famished after my day hike up Piestawa peak and was craving some Vietnamese food. Slanted Rice was one of the first restaurants that popped up for Vietnamese cuisine when I searched for it on Yelp. Just 8 miles away, I drove over and found it easily in a shopping plaza. There is ample parking and I slid up right into a front slot.   It was around 4:30 PM and I came in solo finding a nice spot at the bar where there were other solo diners. The main dining area looked like it can fit up to ~60-70 people, outdoor space for ~20 people, and the bar area ~7 people. The restaurant has a trendy and chic ambiance, but I felt very comfortable dining solo at the bar where you can watch football on a flat screen TV.   To my delight, it was also happy hour (which I believe runs from ~4-6PM) where all appetizers were $1-2 off and certain drink specials. I was excited to try the happy hour food items and ordered the lemon grass brussel sprouts, slanted-sized (1/3 the size of a regular bowl) meat pho, and a fresh shrimp spring roll.   It was the first time I've ever been to a place that offered a smaller sized pho which allowed me to have room to eat other things! The pho was flavorful, but the slanted-size only offered rare meat, no tendon or the other add-ons, but that was totally fine being a sampler size. They do offer other options for the regular sized pho. The fresh shrimp spring roll was also delicious. The brussel sprouts appeared to be deep fried or broiled and were crispy. It's coated with a sauce fragrant with lemongrass. I did find that the sprouts on the bottom of the bowl were slightly soggy. It would be tastier if served on a plate so the sauce is equally distributed.    I left with a happy and satiated belly. I definitely will be back to try out many of their other popular menu items!",

They also have vegetarian pho, and an appetizer size that is just right for me to pair with sharing an app or a spring roll.  Prices are fair and the staff is so welcoming and caring. On my first visit they walked us to our cars (it was about 9pm) even though we were parked right in front, because the bank in their lot had a break in recently.  They have outdoor seating, and the turnover is pretty quick, so you can always get a table.  I've been here a handful of times and will keep this place in my rotation.  Thumbs up for doing things well!",

We went around 6PM which is a bit early for our usual dinner time but we were sure glad we did! Right after we were seated, a throng of people came in and the whole placed got packed within a span of 30 minutes.   The Happy Hour deal is pretty nice. Try it. I don't remember the details but we got $2 off of our spring roll, which delighted us with the burst flavors within each bite.   I had to try the Chicken Crispy Rice in the hot pot due to the raving reviews. Holy Hot. The temperature of the bowl is amazingly close to an active volcano. Which kept the food hot for a very long time. The first few bites, I felt like I was in heaven. However, after a few bites, it started to get too rich for my taste buds.  The flavor of butter and soy sauce starts to get a bit overwhelming. I wish they'd use less butter, but then again, it'd probably hinder with the process of the rice getting \"crispy\".   My husband got the rice noodles with pork. Oh my goodness. Now, THAT was delicious! The vegetables were crisp and perfectly seasoned. The pork was so very good. I ended up eating the rest of his bowl after he was done.    Overall, a good experience. Servers were very nice and attentive. The ambiance is very nice and posh, which is (sorry to say) unusual for a Vietnamese restaurant.",

We got billed for an extra drink. We mentioned it and instead of saying hey I'm sorry can you tell me or show what is wrong instead her tone of voice as if we were all wrong. Several times she was out right rude. Then when it came to closing our tab, she was sweet- I work for a large business - division next door we didn't expect to be treated as such. After we left a staff member came outside asking us if our service was bad and wanted to know why. we said kinda yes. The food was great - the bus boy did amazing and checked on us and approach was so much welcoming and friendly in comparison to our sever so we tipped the deserving one. We told the gentlemen about the tone of voice- instead he argue \"well that doesn't sound bad... \" seemed unwilling to hear what we had to say anyways.. sorry but we are use to eating at super high end restaurant - we didn't expect this scenario to happen. We actually hope it improved as the night went on but it didn't and that is very disappointing. Again food is amazing!

The reason I chose pho was due to all the posts from family and friends. It looked delicious! This place had some great reviews and it looked clean.   We ordered the vegetable egg rolls and they were amazing! Perfectly crispy and great flavor. For dinner, I ordered the steak pho for myself and my daughter. When they brought it to the table, the presentation was really nice. Once I smelled the broth, I felt sick to my stomach. Even the waiter couldn't determine which spice was causing that scent. We thought it was maybe ginger and the waiter said it could be cinnamon. I'm pretty sure it was ginger. I tried to add their house made sauces to rid the smell and it just didn't taste good to me at all. I'm not sure if it's just this place that the pho smells weird but I think I'm going to pass on it. At least I tried!   They didn't take our food off or discount it. Sad to say, I'm leaving the restaurant with a headache and minus $45 bucks. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",

I came here with a couple of my vegetarian friends on a Saturday night.    The owner was serving us and kept us company all night!  I started with the appetizer Pho and some eggrolls.  The eggrolls had a perfect crunchy shell with a warm and moist stuffing of pork and vegetables, it was a pow to my \"Mou\"!  Okay, bad joke aside, it was an eggroll worth ordering.  My appetizer Pho, which to my surprise; how do you make Pho and appetizer!?  Well they did and it worked since it gave me the opportunity to try other entrees without feeling too full.  The Pho broth was perfectly warm and pungent to my nose.  Fresh herbs and sprouts came along the plate and the overall size of it was just enough to wet the palate!   For my entree I shot for the Crispy Shrimp and Garlic Noodles while my vegetarian buddies went for the clay hot pot and  stir fry Vermicelli Noodles with Tofu of course!  Starting with mines, the crispy shrimp was doused with a spicy aioli, but the crunchy coating was what me love this dish, the noodles was dry ramen with a strong garlic and parmesan bite; definitely unique to my palate!  My buddies said they loved their vegetarian dish and I couldn't help but eat off their plate; mainly the clay hot pot!  The clay hot pot dish is a must order here; it made the rice at the bottom of the dish a crusty burn shell but man!  I freakin' loved it!  I think I ate half of it while finishing my own dish!  It came with a medley of marinated vegetables and your choice of protein; gotta say the mushroom in this dish was phenomenal!   Overall, the ambiance was chill and the place had a Victorian Posh feel.  Service was tops and we were showered with love....and drinks....and dessert haha!  -  Enjoy!",

She said they close the kitchen at 9:00pm.  I'm like D** A**, it's 8:40pm.  I was here last month and the food quality was marginal at best.  I figure I give this another shot, big mistake!  The owner needs to retrain the waitress/bartend and let her know that if you have your F***** door open, then you need to serve your customers!  She was also very very rude.  If they wanted to get out of the restaurant prior to 9:00pm but smiled and politely stated that they were closed and offered me a to go option, I would have been totally understanding.  I hope the owner doesn't take for granted the customers that come through her door.  If she ( the owner) does not remedy this issue and provide a training opportunity for the waitress, they will loose a lot of business!",

    "text": "If you're looking for a bit of upscale ambiance to go with your Vietnamese food, Slanted Rice is your place... I've been a handful of times and it hasn't disappointed.    The food is more unique than some of the more casual, traditional Vietnamese places I frequent... I can't speak to authenticity because I've never been to Vietnam.  (Hopefully one day!)  That being said, it's consistent, satisfying food in a modern, classy atmosphere.  A few of my favorite menu items are the spring rolls and curry dishes.  My husband enjoys their Pho.  Head in during daily happy hour (3pm - 6pm) for $1 off Spring Rolls and $2 off Appetizers.  There are also discounted drinks daily from 11am - 6:30pm.  I haven't been in to take advantage of SRVB's lunch specials, but they look like a great deal and include salad and rice (+ soup if you eat in).  Service is friendly, but can be on the slow side.    Keep that in mind and don't head here when you're starving and want instant gratification...",

Special yums to the wings, the clay pots, and the salt & pepper shrimp (and salt & pepper calamari)... the fried jalapenos and onions that come with it are almost as good as the seafood! But beware: everything comes from the kitchen screaming hot -- you WILL burn your mouth if you disregard this notice!  Staff are very friendly and welcoming -- they seem to love being there, and like sharing the great food with the customers! Only reason to give four stars instead of five is that the service is a tiny bit random...doesn't seem like they're understaffed, but that everybody's trying to pitch in on everything and that's a less efficient way to operate a restaurant.",

So we were pretty cautious is ordering our meals - we had the tofu roll, pork Vietnamese rolls, caramelized salmon and crispy rice with tenderloins... On  the side - we had tried the edamame, and garlic wings...   Everything was awesome! The crispy rice on clay pot was particularly awesome and the rolls are excellent.... The fried spring rolls are tasty... You just know when the chef pays particular attention to his creation.

Everything is flavorless, shrimp way over cooked like rubber, and pork/ canned \"Treat\" full of grease. Rice noodles were like a ball of glue.

    "text": "Second time back here on work travel. Came here a few weeks ago with a friend from work & we really enjoyed it. This time on work travel solo came here for lunch & the place was packed. Even with it being so busy the staff was very attentive. Jasmine tea + lunch special of tofu (under the lemongrass lunch specials), soup and salad was fabulous. Last time I was here the shrimp spring roll with peanut sauce stood out. Will definately be back again & I hope this place becomes a staple in N. Scottsdale!",

    "text": "This is white people Vietnamese food. I don't mind paying more for good food but when the food is not good it puts me in a foul mood.   I work next door and was excited that a Vietnamese restaurant was opening up next to me.  I ordered take out a few times and the food sucked. I thought maybe it's take out and the food was not hot enough or got soggy.  So I finally was able to go after work.  Their happy hour is a joke but I guess this place is not known for the happy hour.  Got a bunch of Apps and the lemongrass Brussels sprouts was good.  Calamari only 4 pieces came out and they try to mask it with a bunch of fried onions. I swear I thought I was at Outback Steakhouse and ordered the blooming onion.  Ordered the Pho, I could have gone home and opened a can of Swanson chicken broth , added noodles , meat and made a better pho than this place.  But I guess they are going for the bland white people Vietnamese food to cover the rent.  Can't blame anyone but myself for suggesting to eat here.",

    "text": "best dish on the menu isnt even a dish! its an addition to a dish that you can also get on the side. i love the garlic noodles and always add the grandmas sauce to it  (which is spicy and addicting)!! my favorite spring roll is the dragon lady spring roll which has shrimp tempura and jalapenos in it. Food is always consistent. the owners are always in the restaurant and super friendly.   Poke spot for Pokemon players!",

    "text": "Just called, now they DO NOT take reservations, but have a call ahead model, so YELP is incorrect in saying they take reservations. That needs to be updated. Have had issues with past reservations, them not being aware after being made, so this may be more realistic. Great food, very nice atmosphere, but operationally there are lots of issues, but helps that they are all super nice staff/owners.",
