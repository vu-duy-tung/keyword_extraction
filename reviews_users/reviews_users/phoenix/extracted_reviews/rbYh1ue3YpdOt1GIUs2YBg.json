    "text": "Legit taco stand on the northwest side.  Finally.  All these taco shops keep popping up all over town that want to try to fancy the tacos up and slap a 3-4 dollar price tag on them.  Get out of here with that noise.  All the people really want is a cheap deliciously simple authentic street taco for a buck.  This place is doing just that.  There are only 4 things on the menu.  Tacos, quesadillas, mulitas, and vampiros.  You can get them with carne asada or pastor.  That is it.  There aint no reason for anything else!  Why you gotta have a menu with 5 pages when you can really only do 4 things well?    Tacos Tijuana knows whats up.  These tacos come with quality freshly made and pressed corn tortillas, fresh cooked meat, onions, and cilantro.  They are street sized, bout 4 bites.  And they have a couple salsas on the tables to choose from.  Both are tasty and compliment the tacos well.  The pastor is very flavorful, sweet with the pineapple and tangy from the marinade.  The carne asada was tasty as well.  The vampiro was amazing.  Crunchy crispy fried tortilla with carne asada, onions, peppers, and cilantro.  I could have ate 5 of them if they were a little cheaper. I would not recommend the quesadilla.  For 5 bucks I was expecting a much larger portion and better cheese.    A few things I would change if I owned this shop: Get some heat lamps for these winter months, move the trash cans further away from the tables, maybe do a couple of combos or discounts.  $1.50 for a street taco with homemade tortillas is legit but 5 bucks for a small plain cheese quesadilla is not.  3 bucks for a tiny vampiro is pushing it but it was so good I'd get one again).  The bottom line is if you live on this side of town and haven't been here you are missing out.  If you make bomb tacos and like money you are also missing out...on a golden opportunity.  They are lining up for these tacos folks!  If you make it, we will come!",

    "text": "Growing up in the Southwest, finding a good taco is relatively easy. There are many choices and for the most part, most of them are good to very good. There are very, very few places that can be compared with the taco stands of Avenida Revolution. Tacos Tijuana is one of those few.  The secret to good Mexican Food is the tortilla. If you don't have good tortillas, you don't have good food. The corn tortillas are made fresh, on site. I defy you to find a better tortilla. Those of you complaining about flour (harina) tortillas are missing the boat. Go to Tiajuana. Ask for flour tortillas and the camarero will go to the kitchen and open a pack of Mission Tortillas for you. Flour is strictly an American invention and not authentic to the food or Northern Mexico.   The asada is perfect. Well marinated and spiced perfectly. The asada is comparable or better than most tacos I've eaten in Mexico. The Puerco or Al Carbon is also authentic to my experiences with taco stands in Northern Baja, Sonora and Puerto Penasco. Enough citrus to be tangy and served with lime if you like a little more tang.   As a kid I was told not to eat raw fruit or produce in Mexico so, I never got to experience the guacamole in EUdeMex. However, the guac at TT is the same consistency and appearance as the guac I remember seeing at all the stands in TJ. They add a large portion so it can cover some of the meat flavor. I recommend ordering it on the side.   The red sauce on the tables is hot. I don't care how long you've been accustomed to picante, this stuff will burn a hole through you shirt. I recommend using it very sparingly. A little goes a long way.   The size of the tacos at TT have received some complaints. I assure you, the size of the tortilla is exactly the same size as you would receive at a stand in Ensenada, Rosarito, or Tiajuana. And yes, you can eat ten in one sitting. Because of the size, the price point of $1.75 is a bit much. However, you will not find a superior taco. I promise. The price is worth it.   The atmosphere is lively but not raucous. It is well lit and there is usually a line depending on when you go. I've read reviews of those critical of the trailer/tent/parking set up at TT. Again, go to Tiajuana. Find a taco stand. There will be no tent, no trailer and depending on where you are, no parking. Whether planned or not, the atmosphere nails the authenticity. The food, Cokes with actual sugar served in glass bottles and some narco corridos playing in back ground sets the mood perfectly.  Personally, TT brings back very fond memories of sitting on a small bench next to a taco cart in Downtown Ensenada after three days of surfing and fishing and devouring asada tacos by the dozen with my buddies and a few beers. The only thing missing at Tacos Tiajuana are the beers.",

Well I think I finally found something that can hold off my SD Tijuana cravings. Yes Tacos Tijuana serves authentic Tijuana street tacos, and they are great!!! They have Al Pastor or Carne Asada tacos. Both are only $1.50. I also saw on the menu some other items but I concentrated on the tacos.  I couldn't help myself and ordered 8 tacos for my wife and I to share but I think I ate 5 of the,....lucky they are small but they pack a flavorful punch!!  I also loved the ambience of the food truck. It's a stationary more of a food trailer with a nice canopy. We went during sunset but the lights weren't on just yet. I'd like to come back during the night time to sit under the  Lights.   On a side note the employees were very friendly and will bring out your order when it's ready. Overall I have.

    "text": "Been wanting to try this place for a long time. I was finally in the area and had a chance to do so. With all the great reviews it really had me convinced that this place may be the best spot to grab some tacos. I've been craving some authentic tacos Al Pastor straight from el trompo. According to the pictures and an employee, they said the meat is cut as it directly hits the tortilla. Unfortunately, I was unable to try one of the tacos. They were out of Al Pastor. That was a bit of a disappointment since their only two meat options are Al Pastor and carne asada. They guy who took our order was friendly but he said they had ran out by 2pm and the owner didn't go stock up on his Al Pastor but would have some on Wednesday since that's their least busiest days. Okay, understandable. But if anyone is running a business and there's a hot item that you provide, then maybe it's best to prepare ahead of time to have it readily available and avoid disappointing or draw away the crowd. He convinced me to try the carne asada but that's not what I really wanted. Anyway, I tried the asada and they were good but it was more like as if it was cooked in some kind of juice rather than actually being grilled like asada should be. And I'm not sure if it was me or not but it kind of had a funny little aftertaste. It wasn't a bad one, just one I couldn't put my finger on. Service was great, they kept the place clean but was really disappointed the owner didn't prepare for running out of his popular item. May try the place again and hopefully they'll have Al Pastor.",

I heard about this from a friend, and every time I pass this corner, I would always see a huge line so I knew it was inevitable that I was going to need to stop in and check out this new taco truck/ tent /outside restaurant venue. Let me just say, it did not disappoint! Contrary to the very few negative reviews that are on here, these tacos are amazing! Here is why, the corn tortillas they use are nice and thick and very very tasty. They are definitely of the street Taco variety so make sure you order enough, and my preference is the pork or pastor tacos, but both are very delicious. The meat is very tender, and the toppings are super fresh; you could taste the sweetness of the onion, you can taste the really ripe flavor of the guacamole and the Salsa's are well-balanced both in the medium and also the hot; a perfect mix of Smokey and Spice. Services pretty fast despite the fact that there are a ton of people ordering. If you're even within 10 or 15 miles of this place you have to make this one of your stops or literally the best tacos on the west side! I just finished eating, and I cannot wait for the next time I'm back here!",

First I was told the tacos would be about 40 minutes to come out (waited an hour & a hlf) and I was okay with that. But it's very unfortunate that today 4/24/18 the lady who was working cashier was very condescending and rude. My mother & I asked for chairs to sit at a table and were told there wasn't anymore. So we decided to take our order to go, because there werent chairs avail since that's what we were told 30 minutes pass and they open up a huge truck filled with chairs; the available tables & chairs were then given to other customers behind us. It was a terrible experience. Sadly this will be the last time I come here.",

    "text": "Located conveniently on the parking lot on the corner of 67th Ave and Thunderbird, this Mexican lonchera has been our latest destination for delicious tacos and outdoor dining. The truck is known for handmade tortilla, and offers a large tent with plenty of seating for people to dine-in on the spot. The limited menu features al pastor and carne asada served in Tacos, Quesadillas, or Mulitas. Each comes with cabbage, onion, mild sauce, and guacamole. On every table there are two types of salsa of varying degrees of intensity to match the blazing sun in the Arizona backdrop.  We managed to try both the Al Pastor and Carne Asada Tacos ($1.50). They make the al pastor with a pineapple on the spit. The hand carved pork was tender, well seasoned, with a nice balance of lean and fatty flavors. Similarly, the Carne Asada Taco had good seasoning, as the beef was lean, tender, and not overly chewy. The guacamole added finesse to the tacos, and the touches of cabbage, onion, and mild sauce were enough to complicate the flavors. The single deck golden corn tortilla came with wow factor underscored by its thick and fluffy qualities and good corn flavor. The sizable tortilla effectively held onto everything until the last bite.  The Carne Asada Mulitas ($2.99) was my favorite item on the menu. It arrived with well-seasoned carne asada, cheese, guacamole, and the whole works stacked in-between two handmade corn tortillas. I loved the melted cheese to accompany the beefy flavors and sweet creamy guacamole.   The item that I do not recommend is the Al Pastor Quesadilla ($5.99). The flavor of the Monterey Jack dominated, so I couldn't taste the seasoning on the Al Pastor and the supporting ingredients. The grilled flour tortilla had a wonderful mix of crisp, flaky, and soft textures, but the profile was missing a sharp ingredient to give some pop to the flavors. Other than these subtleties the value did not translate well. I can get a bigger and better quesadilla for less the price elsewhere.  Initially, I was hoping for these tacos to come with double deck tortillas. But given how thick they were, the striking corn flavor would have overshadowed the key elements that made these tacos great. On the down side, I thought each item could include more meat. I also find cilantro and jalapeno to be missing ingredients that could contribute to the overall experience. The idea of a tip jar on every table seemed a bit much, if not impeding the classic working-class lonchera sensibility.   Despite these shortcomings, I find service to be upbeat, friendly, and gracious. The staff worked with a level of enthusiasm that was unmatched, and the quality of their food reflected how much they cared. The ordering process was swift, knowledgeable, with a sense of order, and they did a great job at keeping the area clean. Additionally, they were very kind to bring us some grilled onions and pepper on the side, as well as a warm tortilla for Santi to sample. It was overall a positive experience. I look forward to returning for these delicious tacos and mulitas.",

It took 30 minutes to get my 4 tacos and the meat was cold/warm..why? Lol The taste of the tortillas stood out to me the most than the meat. My grandma is all about lard in whatever she cooks and these tortillas has that taste. The tacos were around $2 each so $8 total for my 4 tacos.",

Tacos are I bit small so load up on them!!!!  After reading Debbie Downers review (Fred)  I had to respond to it. What does the fact that you've eaten tacos in Miami, NY and LA have to do with Tacos TJ? Different cultures use different ingredients or have different family recipes. That's like saying NY pizza and Chicago pizza are better than pizza from Italy.   Secondly, none of the salsas are hot at all. I'm starting to think you came to this place looking for a reason to put it down.   Please stop posting like you're Guy Fieri of Tacos. If think this place sucks then you're standards for good food aren't all that.",

It's a regular line control issue that needs to to be addressed.  It's one thing to all  be walking up. But after waiting for 10 minutes to have one friend, than after your ridiculously long order and paying your friend orders then pays, then just when you think they are done another member and another  and eventually what was a 10 minute wait, becomes a 20 minute wait, all to be told when you arrive there's so many orders in front of you it's 45 minutes wait now.  I walked out and am struggling with my love for this place.  Please address it because you will lose more customers for this kind of poor line management.",

They only offer a few items on their menu, but what they do offer, they do it well. As with a by street tacos, they are small, but the price is very reasonable. Actually their everyday price is cheaper than most Taco Tuesday prices offered by most other places.   They operate out of a food truck in a parking lot of a bike shop, and they get busy. They are fast about getting the food out to you and have developed a pretty good system to make it go fast.   I suggest you try them for a cheap and easy bite if you are craving some street tacos.",

This place gets busy, real fast! So sometimes the wait can be a while. Especially if you come during the lunch and dinner rushes. They also have a limited amount of tables so I usually always end up taking it to go.  The red salsa has mild flavor but pack a pretty good spice punch. The green salsa, I'm not much a fan of. I feel like that one tastes watered down to me, it lacks flavor. These tacos are good and flavorful enough that I don't really need go add the salsa.   My favorite had to be the al pastor. Nice and juicy. Marinated perfectly. You get a little bit of fat on the pork in your bite which really tops it off for me because it's just the perfect amount. Not overwhelming at all.   I just wished they offered a few more meat choices.",

The hot sauces are also on point. Mexican soft drinks. The guac is the \"fluid\" kind, not the chunky style, that's their only downfall. OH yeah - the Pastor is done on the vertical spit like it should be...that tells you what you need to know.  IF you under-order the amount of tacos, no worries...they check on your table regularly and will be glad to bring you some more. Yes, they take cards in addition to cash...

Only down fall during my visit last night was it was obviously busy so I asked the cashier what the wait time is he said just about 20 mins which is understandable considering it was also National Taco Day, and amount of clientele. Mostly to go orders tables came available fairly quickly.  However those 20 mins came and went, before I knew it a whole hour had passed by, the crown downsized significantly again mostly to go orders. By the time they called my number and plates were brought to my table was at the hour twenty mark.  Food was delicious but I don't think I'll be waiting an hour for food here again.    This was my second visit, first visit was a Thursday night arrived around 9:30 and unfortunately they were all out of meat, which is why this time around I arrived earlier.",

Extremely disappointing after reading all the rave about it. There's too many other places like Manuel's or Macayos that are guaranteed to hit the spot. Unfortunately, I will not be back. Maybe it was just my luck. There is a chipotle down the road from this place I'd rather spend my money.",

The business model would run much better if they didn't have you waiting in line as you first walk in, make you're selection and pay up front.  More enjoyable experience would be to have a sit down / waiter take your order, instead of the wait in line time, before you may join the place.   The staff was all over the place. Very disorganized. The cook/waiter walked up to our table to ask what it was that we ordered (paid) after 15 minute waiting in line.  So after taking the order they did not know what we had paid and ordered in the first place?  Decided it was not worth the 'praise' as stated here at Yelp. Great food but lousy experience.",

Personally, I liked Mulitas better but honestly both were great. The place is kinda like just tables and chairs out on a parking lot, but the vibe was really chill and easy. It didn't take too long for our food to arrive (maybe 5-10 mins) and the hot sauce was a great spicy addition :) only concern is the size of the parking lot may be too small. But overall, great place",

The Al Pastor meat has a small sweet kick, maybe a small dose of cinnamon. This is different but makes their Al Pastor tacos unique and delicious. The carne asada meat was well seasoned. I highly recommend the vampiro which is a homemade tostada with meat and veggies. Ambience: it's a taco truck with Class is how I would describe it. The only thing I would recommend is there is room for growth in the salsa department. The red one was okay and spicy, wish the green one had more flavor. In all, keep up the good work! I will definitely be back and recommend it to friends!",

    "text": "A famous dumbass once remarked that if a certain presidential candidate was elected, there would be taco trucks on every corner.  To which I responded (after deadly serious deliberation), how soon can I vote for that candidate?!?!  Living in AZ for almost my entire life, the taco is as ubiquitous as the cactus.  Whether served at a food truck, at a takeout joint, or a full scale restaurant, the taco is perhaps the most democratic dish there is.  An inexpensive delicacy you can hold with your bare hands and devour in droves.  I know a great many who think Taco Bell is the tastiest and most legitimate taco joint in America, and to them I can only say how I sorry I am for you.  For it's the True old school street tacos that win my heart each and every time.  On National Taco Day, it would be unthinkable to not grab a delicious street taco or two and commemorate this day devoted to this gloriously simple, delicious food.  Tacos Tijuana is just a stone's throw from my office, but I'd not yet seen myself in.  At lunchtime on Taco Day, that was about to change.   On the northwest corner of 67th Avenue and Thunderbird, you'll find a Golden Spokes bike shop, a parking lot, and a blue tent.  Next to the blue tent, lies an old unassuming taco truck.  Opened in 2016, Tacos Tijuana is the creation of Adolfo Torres, whose father ran a similar taco truck operation back in Tijuana, Mexico.  I first found out about this truck through a great Phoenix New Times article in spring of 2017 which highlighted Adolfo's family journey to the valley.  Here they're largely sticking to the basics, so much so in fact that they make their own fresh tortillas daily in the truck.  And on the weekends there's apparently a churro cart that parks next to the taco truck and serves fresh churros (noted for future reference).    On Taco Day I was coming for the tacos, but a few menu items were unfamiliar to me.  One of them is a Mulita.  Basically it's a taco but with tortillas on top and bottom like a sandwich.  And there's also something called a Vampiro, which is similar to a tostada except the tortilla largely retains its taco shape, just in crunchy form.  So I got an Al Pastor (pork) Taco, plus a Carne Asada (steak) Vampiro, and an Al Pastor Mulita.  Total cost plus water and tax came to just $10.  Here you order at the entrance to the big blue tent, they give you a number and you grab a seat under the tent (there's maybe 30 seats total).  They brought mine out to my table with stunning speed.  Barely two minutes after I ordered, there it was.    I should note that all of their items come with guacamole, onion, cabbage, and tomatoes.  The Mulitas and Vampiros also have melted cheese.  I'm not sure what they're putting in their pork, but wow this was astonishingly good.  There's some great Al Pastor recipes I've had but this is way up the list.  The seasonings in the Carne Asada were also excellent and the house made corn tortillas were the perfect vehicle.  I particularly liked the Vampiro as the tortilla had a great crunchy texture.  All this goodness for $10 and I was in and out in 15 minutes.   In case you're wondering, the outdoor tent is not climate controlled in anyway so bare that in mind lest you think about sweating it out under the tent during the summer.  I got here at 11:30am and the lunch rush came on around Noon with the line getting about 15 deep.  That said, based on my experience it looks like they know how to crank out a bunch of food at lightning speed so your wait likely won't be long.  And believe me the Al Pastor alone is worth the wait.  The operation is simple, but the food and the prices are fantastic.  If Adolfo had one of his taco trucks on every corner, I think we'd all be that much prouder to live in America.",

On our way out we saw one of the cooks throw out the garbage then proceeded to urinate between the building and trash bin. We watched in awe as he finished up and went back into the trailer and started cooking again! DID NOT WASH HIS HANDS AND URINATED IN PUBLIC! I was so infuriated and went over to the person taking orders and was told they have no restrooms or place to wash their hands on site and they were sure he used sanitizer on his hands before he started preparing food.

The tortillas are made in house and have that fresh maize taste with the perfect consistency.  To add, they have pretty awesome al pastor. I have yet to try their carne asada, but their al pastor alone  is enough to come back for. So yummy (:     The only slight downside is that I just wish they had more variety of meat. They only serve al pastor and carne asada, but it seems to be working for them. They were generating a small crowd when I stopped by.   Anywho! I definitely recommend stopping by Tacos Tijuana if you're stopping by in the area. It's really worth it-- prices are great!",

    "text": "4.5 stars!   I got off work the other night and was going to get myself some grub.  It was either going to be a Sonoran hot dog, or some tacos.  Tacos won!  I had seen this place pop up on Yelp recently, and it wasn't too far from work.  I drove down, parked in the lot, walked up to the podium and placed my order.  There are only 2 choices here...carne asada and al pastor.  You can get a taco, quesadilla, or mulita.  I went with 3 carne asada tacos, 3 al pastor tacos and a Coke to drink.  Total was right under $12.00.  I took a seat at one of their tables, and about 15 minutes later, my tacos were ready.  Here is how they were...........  Carne Asada-  These come with carne asada, onions, guacamole and cabbage (It's a Phoenix thing...the cabbage.  I got mine without cabbage!).  These tacos are a bit small (2 biters) but they were delicious.  The carne asada had a great smokey flavor, and was tender as could be.  The meat is piled onto a home made corn tortilla.  The tortillas were a bit chewier/wet than some of my favorite taco stands, but they were still good!  Some of the best carne asada I have found so far in Phoenix.  4 stars!  Al Pastor-  Wow!  Topped the same as the carne asada tacos.  They have the spit of pork roasting in the truck, and they slice it right off of there into the tortilla.  First bite in, these tacos tasted IDENTICAL to my favorite spot in San Diego (Tacos El Gordo).  This al pastor was legit as fuck!  Just like the carne asada tacos, they were a bit skimp on the meat, but they also only cost $1.50.  Flavor wise though, damn good and these could hold their own compared to other great al pastor places in San Diego and Tijuana.  5 stars!  Coke- Mexican Coke in a glass bottle.  The best!  Overall, I was very impressed!  The tacos were damn good and were some of the best tacos I have had so far in Phoenix.  Only complaint is that it took awhile to get your food, and the tacos were a tad skimp on the meat.  Other than those 2 small gripes, flavor wise and authenticity were pretty much perfect!  I now know where to get my late night taco fix at!",

    "text": "Al pastor! Al pastor! Al pastor! Ohhhhhhh soooooo gooooood. This food truck recently opened in our area. The tacos are mainly composed of meat and guac held by a delicious corn tortilla. In terms of sauces, there is a mild tomato based sauce and a spicy hot sauce. The spicy hot sauce is spicyyyyyy, but the perfect heat to elevate the tacos. I highly recommend adding sauce to those tacos. There is not a ton of toppings in order to highlight the meat. Man oh man, the meat is well marinated! They only offer two types of meat: carne asada and al pastor - both out-of-this-world delicious. The meat is made fresh, char on the outside giving it that nice crunchy texture, and juicy in the inside when you bite into it. I would highly recommend the al pastor if you had to pick & choose. Each taco selling for only $1.50 - ya got a deal! If you're not into tacos, they also have quesadillas & mulitas.   The line moves quickly. It took only 10 minutes between the time we ordered and received our food.  Fast service as they have 5 people busily cooking inside the truck, and 2 people manning the front. The service was excellent! I like how all the workers are wearing the same Tacos Tijuana caps. There is the option to dine outside or take the food togo. We brought our canine buddy, and he was able to chill besides us underneath the canopy while we were downing the tacos. This place made my evening, and I shall be back for more!",

The atmosphere is pretty diving which is nice because I really didn't feel like having to get dressed up and go somewhere upscale. The price was alright for what we got. It was pretty comfortable to what you would pay for most Mexican restaurants. What I like the waitress was super friendly and the portions were pretty big. One regret I have there was not asking if they had corn tortillas I just automatically went with flour. Corn would have been off the chain whatever. I think this is a perfect second date spots or 5th date spot if you get my drift",

So we figured it was good, so one night we decided to eat there, we arrived and the good part was they accept credit or debit cards, we thought it was expensive for the quanity we purchased six tacos, a coke and a flat taco, which total approx $16.00 which to me that is a lot for STREET TACOS not regular Tacos.  They were small.  The spicy Salsa people talk about is awful what they did is placed what seems like Chili de Arbor in a blender with seasoning, which did not get strained.  Overall we will not support that establishment.",

For a Mexican that's a bit to much I'm use to same or better quality tacos at 1.25 max 1.50 a taco and the locations I'm comparing this too has a salsa bar with cucumbers, red raddish to eat with lemon and jalapenos and carrots.. and most importantly a carne asada or pastor tacos is a must to have cabbage.. so they are lacking in many things a great taco place has to offer even If it is a trailer.. and they want more for a taco. I kill one of there tacos in 2 bites. I may try from time to time but I'm definetly not going to be coming here on a regular.. for 10.00 bucks I can get 7-8 tacos with more to that with a salsa bar.",

We ordered a total of four, including two asada and two pastor. Both tacos packed great quality for the price you pay, with their homemade corn tortillas providing very little sogginess that often plague some of these no-frills taco joints. The quesadilla (cheese-only) was priced at $2.99, while tacos were $1.75 a piece. And this was on a Friday night with no specials going on. I definitely can't complain about price.  Comparing them to the tacos I've tasted at more upscale sit-down restaurants would be an unfair judgment. Yes, there are better tacos out there, but definitely not in the immediate area. In terms of convenience and price, I think that Tijuana does a pretty damned good job of delivering!  For my girlfriend and I, I see them as a great option for those evenings where we feel like eating quick and cheap.  Recommended!",

Imagine a family style food truck serving flavorful fresh food with a bursting squeeze of lime and there you have it - Tacos Tijuana.  My order:-  1) El pastor Quesadilla w/ everything 2) 3 El pastor Tacos w/everything 3) Ice cold Mexican soda - Free   After all the hype about this place, I had firmly placed by food critic hat on, scanning my food, preparing myself to drown into this seemingly delicious ambrosia. And....it was my day! Right from the first bite, the magic happened - not to exaggerate, but yes it was indeed lip smacking and tasty!  Robust flavors greets you with well marinated meat, beautifully crunchy chopped caramelised onions with the perfect garnish of fresh cilantro. Splash in some hot sauce and let it sizzle! The chilled coke nicely complemented the soothing evening breeze as I gulped down the plate in no time.   I would love to see them add chicken and vegan options too, only so far they are playing safe with what they know best - Carne Asada and El Pastor.  Caution- The food here is a tummy teaser. Don't waste time snapping it, just dig in and relish till you lick your fingers off.",

There are only a few items on the menu which makes it easy and simple to order. The smaller menu makes it so they can provide better service to their customers.  The truck is located on the northwest corner on 67th and thunderbird (remember its a food truck, not a building :P). The parking lot can accommodate everyone that comes even when it gets busy. There is always a lot of people here but you don't have to wait long for your food.  There is a good atmosphere here. They have an outside siting area with napkins and two different kinds of salsa. I really liked the hot one!   Everyone here is really nice and always smiling. I would recommend this place to everyone I know!",

I was a little disappointed at first when I found out that the menu had very little options so I ordered two steak and two pork tacos and I have to say they were perfect the meat was so juicy and packed full of flavor, it pared perfectly with the guacamole, cilantro, lime, and hot sauce. The hot sauce was probably one of the hottest things I have ever eaten I could only put like 2 little drops on my tacos and I still wanted to drink a tall glass of milk afterwards. The price of the tacos is $1.75 which is unbeatable, especially given the quality of the food which was really good. All in all this place is a must try for taco lovers",

I always search for the best Mexican restaurant when I move from place to place since I am a military man so I have to tell you, this place isn't too bad.  I stopped here because of the good reviews so I wanted to test the authenticity.  First, let me judge the restaurant experience before the food quality:  - Cleanliness:  8 (it's an outside establishment) - Amenities:  N/A - Timeliness:  7  (it was worth the wait) - Price:  8 (for what you're getting, it's great) - Atmosphere:  N/A (it's outside. 67th Ave. and Thunderbird) - Courtesy of Employees:  8 - Quality of Food:  8  Let's cut to the quality of food.  I expect authentic carne asada to be the deciding factor.  The tacos are quite small, but guess what, when you order Mexican food from authentic San Diego/Tijuana, your street tacos are just like that.  Great job!  The tacos and quesadillas that I ordered were fantastic.  I would recommend this place if you have the extra 15 minutes on the way home.  This food will bring you right back to the authentic Mexican origins.  Yummm!  One more thing, because they operate out of a food truck (please expand), you will only get a dinner service.",

    "text": "(TL; DR) Well if you just want the gist, this is a family own and operated taco stand that sets itself apart from a lot of the Mexican restaurants and trucks in town. Quality ingredients are used throughout and the flavors definitely pack a punch. Highly recommended.   Let's start with the thing that captivates the most from the get go. You can't help but to love the homemade vibe this place has. At glance you would think that this is just another greasy, low quality, post boozing at the club taco stand to appease your late night cravings. However, you'd be wrong all along because the charm and warmth in which you are greeted at this family own and operated Mexican food truck is quite welcoming and inviting. You'd be also happy to know that they take card as opposed to the limiting cash-only joints.   The beverages are limited to some canned sodas and bottled water. The bottles of water are big, however, which is a nice difference from the standard two-sips bottles you get at most places.  The service is fast and I mean jimmy johns record breaking fast. I must've waited no more than 5 minutes when our order was ready.  My wife and I ordered a pastor quesadilla and two mulitas (small quesadillas; one pastor, one carne asada) the pastor is full of flavor and the \"tanginess\" you'd expect from quality pastor meat. It's important to point out that this is NOT (as many lazy Mexican restaurants do) just carne asada doused in some unidentified liquid, chopped up and grilled to con you into thinking it is pastor. Most places that serve pastor, seem to just use a store-bought marinade and pour it onto the meat as it cooks on the grill.  This is the real deal my friends, they carve the meat from an artifact that's known in Mexico as \"trompo\" (commonly known as the vertical broiler used to cook gyro meat) and onto your freshly handmade tortillas. Let me repeat that, handmade tortillas. The meat has been marinated for hours before it's stacked up high and slowly cooked to perfection. The carne asada is also not your run of the mill asada, it is top notch sliced meat cooked just right. It's not chewy and it packs a lot of flavor. If I was to make a guess, I'd say they use rib eye meat.  What's also comforting is that the menu is not littered with 50 different items that make you stare into oblivion and thus rushing you into ordering something you are not too sure about.  It is menus like these that make the dining experience enjoyable. Who cares if other taco shops can make 15 types of quesadillas? Simplicity my friends, is king and I hope they keep the menu like it is for as long as possible. I see this place becoming a neighborhood staple in the near future.  They've definitely made me a loyal customer.",

And I mean piled. Also had a Carne Asada Mulitas. Mexico's answer to a Philly cheesesteak sandwich. Fresh, hot and soft corn tortillas with melted cheese, onions and another generous helping of Carne Asada melted together. Between my wife and I, 1 taco, 2 vampiros, 1 mulitas = $11.50-ish Check these guys out.",

I had 3 carne asada tacos and they come with fresh guacamole, cilantro, tomato sauce, & onions also served with a lime wedge! You can tell how fresh these tacos are and the family running this truck really takes the time to work together efficiently to get your order in and out to you quickly!   They have seats & tables right outside their truck which makes it so much easier for some people to enjoy their tacos!   I definitely will be coming back especially to try their Al Pastor tacos!",

Very simple menu of 4-5 items but the magic is in the tacos and quesadillas. Two salsa options, mild or hot. And by hot i mean HOT. It packs a punch. They make their own tortillas and it really sets them apart from any other taco truck. Their corn tortillas are so soft but don't fall apart on you. The carne Asada is made of a good quality beef- not grisly or fatty pieces here. But it sure isn't lacking in flavor either. Their quesadillas are loaded with cheese and protein and again the tortilla is the magic. Service is just as good as the food and I especially appreciate that the cooks wear gloves will preparing your food.",

Today was the day I made time and I'm so glad I did. Now I know why the lot is always so full no matter day or night. This is actually a food truck/trailer and is parked on the corner of 67th Avenue and Thunderbird Road in the parking lot of a bicycle shop. There are tons of tables set up with napkins and music playing from a speaker. When I walked up there was a woman taking orders at a small stand up stand which held them menu in front of it. I decided on a carne asada  and al pastor taco. So simple and easy and under $4. I was given a ticket with a number and within minutes my number was called, but before I could even get up another employee walked them over to me with a bottle of both mild and hot sauce. People were starting to pull up like crazy to order so I'm glad I arrived when I did. The tacos looked small compared to some other places, but this is my vision of how street tacos should be. They were small yes, but packed with meat and flavor. Guacamole was good and everything came out hot and fast! I will definitely be stopping more frequently as well as bringing my husband. He is always on the hunt for a good street taco. Not sure if they were at the taco festival since we didn't see them, but if they had been they would have been our top pick!",

Every component of these tacos was fresh and lively with flavor--I especially loved the burst of cilantro as it complimented the carne asada exceptionally well.   These are exceptionally good tacos from their native land, by comparison to that of chain restaurant Filiberto's/Taco Bell standards. It took a little longer to get my tacos as they were freshly made on their corn tortillas, but it was worth it as nothing was pre-made or stale-tasting.  If you like fresh guacamole, cilantro, spicy and full-bodied meat texture and flavors and tacos that are delicious WITHOUT a drowning of salsa...this place is for you!

    "text": "Well I've never been to Tijuana... yet... but I'm told Tacos Tijuana is close to experiencing the real deal; well, from a taco standpoint, anyways. So let's be honest, I could literally eat tacos every single day for the rest of my life and be happy, although on Taco Tuesday's (btw, whoever came up with \"Taco Tuesday\" is a genius, and I applaud you), I will drive to the ends of the earth for some amazing tacos.   Thanks to all my amazing fellow Yelpers, I came across Tacos Tijuana, and I set off on an adventure with my mom to get tacos... sure, it was 30 minutes away, but to me, everything in Phoenix is \"10 minutes away\" (which is how my mom agreed to come with, lol). We pulled into the parking lot on Thunderbird & 67th Ave, which you literally cannot miss it since it's jam-packed with cars and a huge line of people waiting to eat amazing tacos.   The menu is pretty straight-forward, with the options of tacos, quesadillas, mulita, or vampiro with the choice of beef or pork -- so even if there is a long line, it moves quickly, don't let that scare you away. Once you order, you have to attempt to not steal everyone else's food that comes out; it's agonizing seeing and smelling all the amazing food, only for it to not be yours... your stomach starts growling, your mouth salivates, but you just have to wait your turn. That's the only downfall -- waiting.   But once your food is ready, get ready for some of the most amazing tacos you've had in your life -- yup, in your life; I just went there. Granted I can't speak for the pork anything, but the steak?! My oh my is it tasty, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. My mom and I ordered one quesadilla (which I gave my mom a small bite before I ate the whole thing. Don't judge!), and 10 tacos... yes, ten. Your typical street taco size, kinda small but packed with immense flavor. (I may or may not have eaten 3 tacos after devouring the quesadilla... what can I say? I can eat!)   I will definitely be back to Tacos Tijuana... it is so good; my mouth is watering just writing this review. We also asked why they don't have the option of chicken or shrimp and apparently in Tijuana they only have steak and pork (didn't know this since I've never been to Tijuana), however we were told they were looking into adding to their menu due to everyone's requests, so yay!",

We were sitting for less than 10 mins and our order came out. They give you a good amount of meat per taco along with onion, cilantro and guacamole. The food was great and thought about getting more but still had errands to run. We will definitely be back soon!",

One day, I told my husband, \"Hey, there's this taco truck by our house..we should go!\" And that is how we came about this taco truck.  The menu offering is quite limited, as there are only two choices for tacos:  carne asada and al pastor.  It also serves quesadillas, mulitas, and has plenty of Mexican coke, Fanta, water..you name it.   I have had both the carne asada and al pastor, and I have to say that al pastor wins my heart, but not by much.  Each taco comes with cabbage, onion, guacamole, and is on the most perfect handmade corn tortilla.  They compliment each other well.  Not to mention plentiful hot sauce; they have green and red.  I prefer the red as it has a kick.   I appreciate the fact that there's a tent, which adds a homey type feel.  There is plenty of seating and tables, as many patrons come and go.  Service here is top notch and workers are very friendly.  I definitely would recommend this gem to anyone looking for their taco fix.   Prices are very decent and the flavors are just perfect.  This establishment also takes cards, which is a plus!  Plenty of parking too.",

I normally don't care for corn tortillas  but these were good also great flavor and very fresh. The hot sauces green mold red hot were both good and had a great flavor with a good spice level to them. I have to be very honest I used to go to a place called taco head but this place is a lot better. I am looking forward to taking my wife Ashley here very soon..

    "text": "Besides hot dogs, what other addicting simple street food is there? T-A-C-O-S, Tacos! Indeedy deed! But these aren't your average run of the mill tacos.    What separates Tacos Tijauna from the pack is the use of handmade corn tortillas, in the literal sense too.  You can see them pressing freshly made dough and flattening them out for the next order.  It does not get any better than that.  On top of that, you can see a hunk of meat rotating on their heating device, which I believe is their Al Pastor.  That is the way I like to see my street food come off of.   Unlike most Taco places and trucks, the menu is very easy to order off of.  You either pick Al Pastor or Carne Asada for your taco choices.  Besides that you can get cheese quesadillas with some meat included.  I would say, I have enjoyed both very much but I have a personal liking for the Al Pastor.  To put the tacos into words, I would say its simple, flavorful, textured and addicting.  I believe the key trait about the tacos that makes them 'Tijuana' is that they always add a little drop of guacamole spread on every tacos unless you specify otherwise.    $1.50 gets you a taco! It can get super busy on any given night but its worth the little wait.  I've seen folks come just to order to go.  The folks who run this little awesome business are super kind and friendly.    I live walking distance to here, so I'm a very happy camper, I get to enjoy street tacos whenever I want.",

    "text": "I first visited this amazing Taco Truck 4 days ago with a friend and felt extremely guilty that I couldn't share the experience with my husband. So, today I brought my husband and ordered Tacos and Mulita's. Everything on their menu comes with tasty Asada or Pork, onions, cilantro and Guacamole, so beware of allergies. We had some miscommunication on the Guacamole, since we're both allergic to it, but they remade our Mulita's without any hesitation and it came out very quickly.  My husband was enjoying himself and we're definitely going to be repeating customers. The parking lot can be a very big challenge as there is such a demand for this tasty food. There are no marked parking spaces which allows inpatient drivers to do their own thing and park crazy. This Taco truck is located on a parking lot, so be mindful if you're bringing kids in tow and keep an eye on them as I stated the parking can get a little crazy. If you see a line, don't let that discourage you, the food is worth the wait.",

The menu is very simple, two kinds of meats (carne asada and el pastor) and three ways to have it (tacos, quesadilla, mulitas).  There is small podium where you place your order from then you have a seat at the tables under the covered area and they bring the food out to you.  The trailer they serve out of looks pretty new and from what I could see inside it looks very clean, along with the glass windows in front you can partially see inside and can see the el pastor on the reel thing that gyro meat is usually on.  It is kind of loud here only because you are at a major intersection, but with nice weather in the evenings and tasty food you don't really notice.  The food was served with a lemon slice and there is mild and hot sauce on the tables to use.  I am not a huge fan of corn tortillas, but they taste so right with the tacos and mulitas.  Overall the food was very tasty and I will be coming back for more.",

The tacos are small (two bites for me) but at $1.99 (with cheese) you can't beat it. The other spot I go, with cheese are around $3. The quesadilla is amazing. Of course you will have to add carne asada. Only two meats available. None of that poultry. Me and wife ate there Friday after a long dmv visit and I just stopped for some to go. Place was packed. (Saturday at 330). A must try! The red sauce is hot and the complementary guac sauce is awesome.",

    "text": "TL;DR: a simple, well-executed menu leads me to fantastic food. Would highly recommend.   My car's air conditioner is, for the moment, unfortunately broken- poor timing as our typical triple-digit temperatures have begun. It, however, does come with an upside: it lead to my discovery of Taco Tijuana. As I was driving past, a delicious smell wafted into my car through my open windows. Thus enticed, I made a stop. The menu is pleasingly simple: two meats(Carne Asada, Al Pastor), three dishes(tacos, quesadillas, mulitas). The food was very quick, the service pleasant, and the environment clean. The carne was tender and moist, and the pastor was obviously well marinated and freshly sliced, tangy and juicy. They had two sauces on the table, starting with a medium heat salsa. (Tomatillo/roasted chili, I think? Was honestly too busy with rapidly consuming tacos and wasn't really paying attention, but it did have a great, vaguely vegetal green flavor, balanced with a hint of smokiness and a mild kick.) It was smooth enough to be dispensed copiously via squirt bottle but with enough texture to provide a pleasing contrast to the creaminess of the guacamole used on the tacos. Finishing off the roster is a roasted chile hot sauce, bringing a deep red, earthy punch, almost nutty with a decent amount of heat. And that's it. No large, complicated menu, no gimmicks. Just really good food at a very reasonable price. Seriously, you have to try this place.",

In other parts of the world and even in California this sort of \"temporary restaurant\" is very common, but here in Phoenix, especially in such a suburban area it's a novelty.  I have eaten street tacos all over the country, in places like Miami, New York and LA. These are no where near that quality. The pictures posted here are deceiving, because these tacos are TINY. I imagine some one with an appetite could easily finish each taco in a single bite. In my opinion a full grown, hungry man could easily eat 10 of these tacos. The meat they use is nothing special at all and the only good part is the guacamole they use on them.  A few things to consider though, the red sauce they have is beyond hot and I have a high spicy tolerance. It not only was spicy in the mouth but just a teaspoon of it made me sick all night. Either it was that, or the tacos. The service was friendly no doubt but there is no value and if the food makes you sick why bother? There are a million great places in the Phoenix Valley to get tacos, why waste your time?",

The muleta is meat sandwiched between two corn tortillas, and the vampiro is finished on the griddle for a hard shell (like a tostada). Major plus: 20% off on Taco Tuesdays ;)",

The pastor was amazing,  the taco de tripas  (extra crunchy) was to die for and the tacos de asada were soft and perfect.  They have all the fixing and are fresh. Cucumbers,  radishes,  and lemons go well with the tacos. I've been to many taco places and this one is one of the best ones. The meats are tasty and well cooked. They know what they are doing here",

Since moving to Pheonix 3 years ago I always make a point to stop by as many random taco spots as possible. Where most are good, Tacos Tijuana is one that I would drive across the state for. The street tacos are just what you need in your life. Juicy, perfect asada and al pastor, with fresh onions and guac. The mulitas (Little quesadilla sandwiches) are something I didn't know I needed until I had them. Same amazing asada or al pastor but with cheese sandwiched between two street taco shells.  Their salsas are incredible with the \"hot\" salsa actually having real heat that makes your nose tickle and your mouth water. Their is a usually a line but with service this fast the waits are minimal. You need this in your life.",

Today, we weren't looking and found them, right on the NW corner of 67 and Thunderbird in the Golden Spoke parking lot.  AMAZING flavor in all the ingredients. The homemade corn tortillas melt in your mouth along with the steak from the carne asada. The salsas are wonderful. The hot is actually hot and the mild is very fresh and flavorful. And, despite this being a food truck, the young men that work out front are extremely helpful in keeping the tacos coming when you want to order more (which you will!) and keeping the area clean.",

We tried both the carne Asada and al pastor tacos, and also the cheese quesadilla. Everything is a winner. I feel bad, but I might have to jump ship from Waldo's taco truck... Nah, I'll still eat both. BTW don't make the same mistake I did and try to make a lunch out of this, they do not open until 5:30pm.",

The Carne Asada Taco's are <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. I absolutely loved them. This place is a game changer because there are no good street taco spots on the west side. All my favorite Taco spots are in east Phoenix or in Scottsdale. So happy and I'll be back very soon.  *Phoenix Foodies Approved",

I really liked the steak asada mullita and the asada taco. They come with guac on them which is cool and the sauces on the tables are pretty good. The service was solid too. I wish they still carried the Sprite bottles though! Only downside was my tortilla shells were a little soggy and falling apart as I picked up the tacos. Will be back.",

So, when you are craving Tacos, and I mean real tacos, this should be on your top 5 in town. Don't ask for a burrito, or a vegetarian taco, or any other substitutions that kill the taco.

The 5 stars are for the food, the only con I can think of is the parking and seating area. It's a food truck that parks outside of a store in the parking lot. Seating is under a tent and there is no bathroom. I don't mind right now as the weather is super nice, but I don't think I'll visit in the summer unless I'm waiting in the car while someone else picks it up. Also, the parking situation is a bit unruly. There are no lines (except for the ones for the store, which are few) in a majority of the lot, so people park like maniacs. Last time I was there I got blocked in, we told the cashier, and when he told someone to move it they took their sweet time. We never even saw them, another guy moved a different car and we just inched until we could squeeze through. I'm hoping that they will eventually find a permanent home in a store front. Again, the food is unbelievably amazing.",

This food has a very authentic taste, it is definitely worth checking out. The atmosphere is very laid back.",

    "text": "These tacos are really good.  Nothing wrong with the food.  My issue was the service.  I showed with a party of about 8 people.  Busy Tuesday and I understand.  I was the last to order.  15 min went by and everyone started getting their order one by one. Finally the person before gets her order and I'm thinking mine is next.  My other buddy decides to order to go and 5min later gets his second order.  Then the table next to us starts getting their orders.  I asked one of the servers about my order and she said, \"maybe they forgot about you \".  I know she was being funny but at that time my party was pretty much done with their food.  I went to the counter and just asked for a refund.  Then they realized that they forgot my order and told me it would be out right away.  I declined and just asked for my money back for the second time.  Then one of the girls said \"take it to go!\", then I heard \"it's Tuesday, we are busy\".  Then the guy at the front said \"they lost the ticket, it happens a lot\".  All these suggestions and comments and not once did I hear \"hey man, sorry about that.\" Or \"that's our bad, we apologize\".  Simple apology and acknowledgement would it been cool, I would took my tacos to go.",
