They were generous with the chicken, but it was just a tad dry with a little too many onions in it. I also tried a strawberry boba tea, without the boba. It wasn't bad. Tasted like a strawberry daiquiri.  I'd be willing to give this place another go.",

The Pho here is one of the best...the broth is hot and very clean, just enough meat and just a hint of anise...portion size is perfect.  The springrolls are average...Little Saigon in downtown Glendale puts shrimp & grilled pork in their springrolls.  I have also had the curry chicken and the mongolian beef which  both come with white rice and both delicious with high quality meat & lightly flavored & not overly sauced. Okay now the negative...other than the Pho, the portion size of food is too  small...you get 1/3 of what other vietnamese restaurants serve. For $8.95 I expect more than white rice & a small fist size of Mongolian beef or curry chicken...I guess I will just stick to the Pho & sandwiches.",

Each table has a call button attached to the wall that will page them when pressed. Thats a great way and attempt to make sure they attend to you. The format of seating in the restaurant is a little different and forms an \"L\" shape which is also why I'm sure they have the buttons for. The times I've come here, the restaurant is clean. Dirty was never an issue the times I've eaten here. My favorite is the bbq chicken pho, as for appetizers I like the eggrolls. The grilled chicken with fried rice. I'm simple but I love flavor. Its the best one yet I know on the west side of town. I've been here a few times and I always leave full and satisfied.",

    "text": "I'm so lucky this place is right across the street from Banner Estrella. It really satisfies my Asian cravings during long hours of work. A lot of medical staff & docs order togo from this place for a quick meal during lunch/dinner break.   The pho is pretty decent for AZ. It's not as outstanding as the pho in Cali, but I would recommend this place if you want some good pho in AZ. I usually get the pho tai, which is one of my favorites. If I don't feel like pho, I usually order egg noodle soup as an alternative - their broth is spot on. At times when I'm especially hungry, I'll add on the combination appetizer. The pork egg rolls are yummy!   It's a little pricier than Pho Thanh on Camelback, but I think it's worth the drive. This place is way cleaner with great service.",

I found this place was close by and open longer. So we got there and looked and quickly ordered. They were very quick. Within 5 minutes we had our dish. We both ordered number 9. Which if I remember correctly was medium rare and shredded. It was so moist and yummy. We were both impressed with how nice and how quick the service was. And the meal was awesome! Us being desperate turned into finding a good pho restaurant haha. I'm so glad we did. Him and I are both very picky on pho too. So this was good that we both liked it. And the plate with stuff to put in it, they actually gave one to each of us. One for him and one for me. Which was awesome cause we could put more than usual! So yummy.",

The pho broth was too sweet, as was the nuc mam sauce for the egg rolls and vermicelli noodle dish. The egg rolls tasted strange and the goi con was fresh but did not have any mint or green onions wrapped in with the noodles, pork and shrimp. Very bland. And the peanut sauce was diluted. I don't believe that Song Lynn is a True Vietnamese restaurant as the name is not authentic and there are Chinese dishes on the menu. We sat in front of the TV that sits too high in the wall. The radio and TV were on at the same time which made it loud and difficult to concentrate on one sound. Sadly, I will not ever eat there again.",

Sadly, they don't delivery anymore....but I like their food enough to get off my lazy butt and go pick it up....so if I'm going to go I ways pick up a feast for us to spilt and eat off of all day. Our favorites are the spring rolls and the egg rolls to start. The dipping sauces are all very tasty. I'm not a huge fan of peanut sauce but theirs is pretty darn good. My favorite though is the slightly sweet but vinegary one that comes with the fried egg rolls (the one with shredded carrot floating in it) I like to dip everything in it...I could drink it!  Hubby always gets their Pho...I pass. It's certainly not bad...but not my favorite pho in the valley.  Instead I always gorge on the spicy chicken pad Thai. It's to die for! Love their noodles better than any pad Thai I've ever had. We also get a pork bahn mi. Bread is perfectly soft and chewy...perfect amount of mayo and fresh veg. Only complaint is sometimes the pork can be a little chewy. It's hit or miss but never been bad enough for me to not eat it. Overall it's a good joint for the west valley",

Song Lynn is among my favorite Pho spots and it is your best option if you live in the far West Valley. Its clean, modern, service is quick and they accommodate an array of options from vegetarian, gluten free etc.The Banh mi are fresh and the bread is so soft and crispy. The Spring Rolls are made to order and the portions of Pho are quite generous. We usually order appetizers and share a large bowl of pho P1 or P12. The Curry is fantastic and the Song Lynn Special (S1) Is amazing, Its a nest of noodles and fresh stir fried veggies with your choice of meats. I love how they already know what I usually order and how I like it prepared. I love extra limes and jalapenos and they always accompany my pho. They are very attentive and  I come here several times per week because the food is consistently delicious! Happy Hour is from 3-7pm but prices are great all day. You can literally have a Vietnamese feast for less than $25 bucks!",

My family had ordered a couple bowls of large size P1(Pho Dac Biet) and a large bowl of Bun Bo Hue.  The $10.50 they charge for the portion of a large bowl was not worth it.  The meat they gave was like cheap scrap meat and on top of that they didn't even put the right cut of meat in the Bun Bo Hue.  Not sure if they ran out of the correct meat and just substituted with whatever they had left.  I definitely will not come back!",

This old guy which seem like his a boss there he said the broth is free with my rice, but when I paid and look at the price they charged me for the soup that they say it was \"FREE\". I compared my receipt to the price in the order book and it was different. So they did charge for my small bowl of broth. So whoever goes there please check your recipes and make sure they don't charge you extra money. I would've paid extra money if they would tell me the truth, but instead they lied to me saying its free and yet they charge me extra money.",

I could barely taste the pork and could NOT taste the shrimp even though I could plainly see them.  They were good size, too.  That's what happens when restaurants use seafood that has been treated with TSPP (a preservative).  It washes out the flavor.  Almost all of the shrimp one buys in this country has been treated.  The peanut dipping sauce was the worst peanut sauce I have ever had.  It had a strange taste (fish sauce, maybe).  I did not finish them.   As a main entree, I had the P7 -- rare beef soup.  I asked the waiter for his recommendation and went with that.  The broth had no depth.  There was no beef flavor.  The flavors were plenty of cilantro, some onion and a seasoning I am not sure about (5-spice, maybe).  The thin sliced beef in the soup was essentially tasteless.  Of the four Vietnamese restaurants I have eaten at in the Valley, this is the only one I would not go back to.",

Later they took my order and brought the food out fast and literally wanted me to finish a regular shrimp pho in 5 mins. 5 mins after I got the food different people kept walking up to the table to see if I was done when it was around 9:20. I was trying to eat fast because I just didn't feel comfortable anymore and then this worker walked up to the table again so I asked him for the check so he could just take my card and I could fit in another bite but instead he wanted me to get up right there and leave and at that moment I was in tears because of how upset and embarrassed I was, he asked me if I wanted to take it to go and I said no I didn't want to take their shitty pho home that only had like 4 shrimps in it. I was so mad I didn't get to enjoy the food that I PAID for. I just didn't want to deal with it and me and my brother got up to go and i gave him my card while I waited in the car because i just wanted to get out of there. NEVER in my life have I ever had shitty service like this. And also the waiter got upset because we didn't tip. I should've of spit in his face that should've been his fucking tip. It was 9:28 by the time we left. Don't go to this place if you don't want workers who don't know you talking about you negatively. Things could've gone WAY differently if they would've just said \"hey we're closing in 30 mins we can only do take out\" or something rather than to just try to shove the food down my throat in 5 mins. I would've understood because I'm not crazy or aggressive and this is the first review I ever wrote on anything so yeah I'm pretty upset.",

We got our food to go but the girl who took our order was very friendly and helpful. Our food was packaged nice and secure which i definitely appreciated.   We ordered two kinds of pho, chicken fried rice, crispy chicken wontons and vietnamese spring rolls.   The portions were very generous with a good amount of meat. The crispy wontons were very tasty and were even still hot when we got home. The soft spring rolls were pretty bland even with the dipping sauce so i will probably skip those next time.   Their bahn mi looked very tasty so i will definitely be hitting them up again to try some other things.",

The food wasn't EXCEPTIONALLY killer, but the atmosphere was just so bright and healthy, coupled with great service, making the meal much better than average.

The tables have a call button to get the servers attention and they use tablets to place orders.  Our server knew the menu well and I was glad to hear it was a family business that has been open for a year know.  This is a hidden gem and I wish them great success.  Everyone was friendly and several employees, possibly one of the owners, asked if everything was good.  We had the fried shrimp rolls, chicken dumplings, and pho.  The plating was very nice!

I asked to add extra meat which came to an up charge of $2. Not bad. Also, the broth was super flavorful. Everything inside looked clean and the service was good. Highly recommend if you want to try a new pho place.",

First off this place is packed until they're closed which was a great sign, second the service is fantastic! The employees were on top of everything and were very attentive. Lastly we got a large bowl of pho, a regular size of pho, garlic wings, and jasmine hot tea and it was all DELICIOUS. I 100% will be coming back to try more of their menu but definitely for the pho because it had a great ratio of everything and tasted so so good. The price is fantastic considering how high quality the food is, you should definitely check this place out!",

The staff are very friendly, the menu consist of lots of pictures with small descriptions which is helpful. We ordered spring rolls, they were good but obviously had been made in advance they were a little hard around the edges. My husband and I both ordered the dumpling pho but I had Pork he had beef... It was good, but nothing extraordinary, my kid ordered the shrimp fried rice which was good also. It's a tad more pricey than some of the places we usually go to but not by much. Over all it was good, but honestly I'll stick to my other 2 spots.",

Right off the bat, I noticed that the pork/nam was rather brown compared to the red colored meat that I'm use to seeing. Also, they did not have the fried egg roll wrapper that's traditionally wrapped inside.  For my main entree, I ordered the bun tom thit nuong cha gio and my boyfriend the mi xao don tom. I would order his dish a second time.   It's hard for me to find a notable Vietnamese restaurant since I'm spoiled by home cooked meals at home. Overall, everything was decent so I would come back again.",

Flavor was there, but the meat was tough, almost like chewing on shoe leather.  Service was OK... the people there didn't particularly seem like they wanted to be there, but it happens.  Glad I tried it for the sake of saying I've been there.  But won't be back...",

Their broth is tasty and savory, without being overwhelming to the ingredients you put inside. They are very accommodating for takeout orders and package everything up for you that you might need. I'm a fan of their Well Done Brisket Pho, as well as their Vietnamese Coffee and their appetizer sandwich.   The parking lot is small, so be prepared for that. It's tucked into the southeast corner of 91st Ave and Thomas Rd, next to SimonMed Imaging and behind the Starbucks. I love supporting local and these guys deserve your business.",

The pho is very sweet and I literally had 2 meat ball and a few tendons the rest was all noodles and broth.  I'm very surprised that they had such good reviews. I knew the moment I walked in and it was so quit on a sun 12 noon this looks bad. I wanted to go some place else but we were all hungry and thought to give them another try.

It was fair priced, and definitely left us full. We are looking forward to our next return.",

    "text": "I reeeeally want to like this place but after my fifth attempt it's just not going to happen. I know .. it took me five times. I wanted to make sure.   The Pho broth itself is mediocre. Hardly any flavor making it necessary to overload on hoisin and sriracha. The brisket has a weird flavor to it.   Second time I went there I wanted to try another dish. I got a pork Banh Mi and spicy lemongrass chicken. The banh mi was actually pretty good but definitely did not have enough meat. What was in there was about half a sandwich worth. The lemongrass chicken was also pretty good. The chicken was cut into tiny pieces and the lemongrass flavor was plentiful. I was getting my hopes up for this place! I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt and hoped the lack of flavor from my first visit might be the cook trying to find his/her place in a new setting.   The third time I went I got the pork banh mi and the lemongrass chicken again.  The meat in the banh mi had a very scary flavor.  Tossed that immediately and dove into my chicken. Opened the container and it looked like a basic Chinese dish with big chunks of chicken and vegetables. And the flavor? Absolutely none. UGH Ok. Back to square one.  Fourth time, I got the beef banh mi and a shrimp and pork vermicelli dish. The banh mi was delicious.. All two pieces of meat at least. The shrimp in the vermicelli was soooo dry n overcooked.  Another disappointment.  Fifth and final attempt. One last chance because I'm hungry and craving Vietnamese food. I get a spicy beef with lemongrass and cha gio. The cha gio had little pieces of tendon? gristle? in it. Something with a hard popping texture. Not excited about that. The broth for the spicy beef with lemongrass had a strange unidentifiable smell to it. Totally turned me off.   I think I went through a fair amount of the menu to give a fair rating. This place is just not happening for me. I will stick with 43rd Express or Dong A. THIS is where you need to be if you think this place is the  best. I think most of the five stars is for the \"cleanliness\" \"newness\" and not the actual food.  Shame.",

On the verge of giving up of what seemed to be a figment of my imagination, I found this place.... YAY!!!  The PHO was FANTASTIC! It came in a smaller bowl I was accustomed to but it was a optical illusion because it was a quite satisfactory amount.  The ambiance was more modern and clean. (Kind of reminded me of a quan nhau... hmmmm now I wonder... lol)   Their primary server is a young bilingual latina, which I think is genius!!! I don't have to be confused if I'm ordering a orange juice or a manicure... But they of course they also have the traditional Vietnamese servers if that's your cup of tea who are also really nice and helpful.   I'M SO GLAD FOUND THIS SPOT! AND IT'S NOW MY GO TO DEFAULT PHO PLACE!   =)  NOOB TUTORIAL:  it's pronounced \"FUH\" not \"FOE\"",

Please everyone check your receipts and make sure they are not adding tips to your bills even when you clearly marked out the tip line and put a total for a pick up order (I usually tip if I am dining in, but not for take-out). My receipt showed one amount but my statement had another. The excuse I was given for this error was a glitch in the system which made no sense in my situation. Their solution was for me to drive back to the place, which I live about 20 minutes from and only went here because they had good ratings, to get the tip refund. If this was my business I would have fully refunded my customer the entire bill in order to ensure they returned in the future. This place has lost my business for sure!",

I was actually surprised at how much of a smile our waitress had for the entire time we were there. She seemed to greet everyone with a genuine warm personality and gentle niceness.   I ordered the Pho and Donna got the Beef Stew and we both spent the $2 more for the XL bowls. The food arrived and we felt like the XL bowls were the size of regular bowls at most places.   The Beef Stew was 4 stars of goodness...  The Pho was 3.8 stars of goodness...  All in all I just feel a bit odd when my bill is $28 after a small tip for water and 2 bowls of soup... It's just a bit carried away for price....   General rule of business is that you make more in volume sales at a lower price than higher prices but lower volume.   AKA Farmer Logic: You can shear a sheep a hundred times, but you can only skin him once...",

    "text": "A grey and gloomy day outside and what's better than a giant bowl of pho. I'm looking for a new place to indulge and I turn to my trusty Yelp. I found a location near by with great ratings. Four and half stars with 299 reviews. This may be 300...  I entered the nicely designed and comforting establishment. I was immediately welcomed with a smiling face and promptly seated. The heavy aroma of beef stock filled the room. So many tasty looking options on the menu but I had my mind set on a large bowl of pho. My order was quickly taken and the fresh garnish was brought out.   I ordered fried spring rolls and the Pho Tai Bo Vien (rare beef and meatballs). The spring rolls came out  beautifully golden and hot enough not to handle right away. The vinegar sauce was great with the rolls. I only wish I had extra roman lettuce garnish. I love dipping the leaves into the sauce after biting the roll. The large bowl came out and conquered the table with its steaming entrance. The concentrated scent of a carefully simmered beef broth was steaming in my face. There was no shortages of rice noodles, tender meatballs, and nicely marbled thinly sliced beef. The broth with its slightly oily sheen was absolutely wonderful on its own. After enjoying it in its intended form I further garnished and spiced it up with garlic chile paste and sriracha.  The pairing of fresh basil leaves with sliced meatball is fantastic. The bowl was almost too much to finish. Almost...   I would definitely recommend Song Lynn to friends and family. I'll be dreaming of this delicious dish until I return. Well done to everyone working there.",

We get the rare beef pho and they give a generous portion of the beef(literally had a bite of beef with every bite of noodles) and generous portion of all the toppings included. Soup tastes great and everything is very fresh! We don't like getting take out pho anywhere else now because of all of the above mentioned.",

When you enter the restaurant it smells like food (as it should!) and not like a strong, cleaning product which most pho places smell like which totally deters me from eating there (because I can't stand that smell and that's just me). Anyway, the food is yummers especially the pho which is basically why I eat here. Also, I really like how fast it is to order and how the food comes out so quickly. I've even been able to order food and pick it up which helps for those nights when the fam wants Vietnamese food for dinner!",

We started with the fried dumplings which are called goyza in a lot of places, nothing special but tasty. We had the chicken wings which are  not what you would think. They are fried  and meaty. Both drums and flappers, not small wings but of a good size. Served with sauteed red and green peppers and onions and green onion tops which also come with the fried calamari and the salt and pepper shrimp that we ordered. The salt and pepper shrimp come with a ramekin of garlic salt which you can sprinkle on yourself. These can be ordered shell on or shell off. We opted for shell off and were really pleased with this dish. The shrimp are fried in a very light coating of flour and the were a nice size and very meaty and super good. The calamari had a heavier breading but was meaty and very tender. Also a taste treat. We were very pleased with our choices and of course as usual the service was very friendly and helpful. This place seems to be very popular, this was a Saturday evening and it was very busy but everything was well paced. Would certainly recommend this place for anyone just wanting to try different appetizers.",

I work down the street and this is on my way home, I had been telling my bff that I wanted to try this place for quite a while.  I had worked in my classroom late on night last week and I wasn't in the mood to cook...so I stopped to get an order of pho to go...I am so glad I made the choice.  Savory broth, raw beef, fatty brisket.  An abundance of noodles and veggies and a slice of lime.  Hoisin and sriracha.  Spring rolls.  Just do yourself a favor and order them.    Well, a week later and the bff and I were out and about on a rainy night.  What is better than a big bowl of pho on a rainy night?  Again, perfection.  Friendly and fast service is just the icing on the cake!  One word of warning...they're closed on Wednesdays!",

Our waiter was nice and patient and helped us out, she was so sweet. So atmosphere and customer service wise, this place is a 10. Now for the food.  I got the Spring Rolls with pork, and my friend got spring rolls with shrimp and steak. I also got Pho with meatballs and Thai Tea Boba. the spring Rolls were delicious, I love the BBQ pork, it's my favorite thing ever. It only had one small slice of the pork, I wish it would have had more, though. The spring roll was big, but it just needed a little more pork! Perfect none the less. The Pho was amazing, broth was really good, but I was so sad because I put the wrong chili, there was 3 different types and the chili I put made my pho taste more smokey, but it was so good anyways. I couldn't even finish my bowl honestly, I was so so so full half way. It makes me sad when that happens. The Thai Tea boba wasn't as good, honestly. The boba was sticky and chewy. The Thai tea itself was just like any other Thai Tea haha. But it was still drinkable so I can't even complain. The food came out QUICK and the employee was so nice to us cause we kept asking for things, I kind of felt bad haha. Really good to go out w a friend or two and really just dig in, we were so full. Thank you, pho real! (Get it ahhhhh)",

The fried egg rolls were okay, a little too bland for my taste; and the lettuce served with them could have been fresher, they looked so lifeless.  My friend got the pork & shrimp spring rolls, but it was 95% rice noodle, 5% pork & 0% shrimp.  The pho was pretty bland, lacking the beefy/meaty flavor normally found in the soup.  Even with all the hoisin sauce that I put in, it was still so bland.  I would come back here, but only because it's near my friend's place. Hopefully, the rice dishes are better.",

Nothing is upscale about this place. The food is only cater toward Caucasians and non-Asian groups who know NOTHING about fine Asian dining.

We can get 2 orders of Pho and Bahn Mi at Da Vangs and pay $15 (including a 20% tip). At Song Lynn that same meal costs almost $30.  Overpriced but very good. The nicely re-worked menu is saving them from dropping to 3 stars in my book. Everyone is still very nice, but even with gas factored in its cheaper to drive to central Phoenix from the west valley.  Sorry guys, we won't be coming back as often as we have in the past. Still a good place, if you don't mind spending a little extra.",

I've asked for a smaller amount so he doesn't waste but they are just extremely generous and happy to have you there!   It has a really nice ambiance too, we always like to sit by the fish tank. There is a semi open kitchen which is pretty unusual too and speaks to their comfortability at letting everyone see how their food is prepared.  They have a cute ice cream macaron freezer too !",

This time however, I deviated from the plan cause they had the Vietnamese beef stew.   I used to get it all the time at my go to place but I've moved across the country and haven't had it in years. Most pho places I go don't offer it so I had to get it   I started with the required summer rolls. They were good, a little too much green to shrimp but good nonetheless   The beef stew came out and it was as I remembered. Full of tender hunks of meat, carrots and noodles. The meat was tender and yummy. The only difference was my old place made it pretty spicy. This place was mild but the broth was tomato red and tasty. Service was good. Thai iced tea wasn't sweet enough for me, I like it real sweet.",

    "text": "Ok I tried this place because of the reviews.   I was NOT impressed. I've tried many Pho places through the valley, from dives to upscale.  This place had the prices of upscale, but was dirty and smelled like a dive.   I came in at about 11 am.  Only one other table was filled.       The place had the sour smell of unwashed bodies. It's the only way I can explain it. Definite sour BO smell.  I was not impressed with the person at the front counter, as he asked my name and seemed to think I was there for a take out order. I had to ask him if I should seat myself.  This confused him so he asked if I wanted to place a take out order.  I told him I was dining in.  He said take a seat he would bring a menu.    I seated myself in what looked like the cleanest of a the booths,  I was wrong they were all this filthy.  Considering they had only been open 1 hr, you could tell they just didn't care about cleanliness because the spatters all over the wall were obviously old, and looking around and seeing straw wrappers on the floors, dirt under the table legs where they had cleaned around the legs but not pulled out the table to clean under it recently.   A few crystal like chandeliers do not make up for lack of daily cleaning and wipe downs.  So pretentious those crystal light fixtures are in such a place.   I ordered the p1 without tripe and a soda.          Another couple came in and ordered Pho also, so why did they get their order before mine?       The soup was hot, tasty and plentiful, however I had asked for no trip and I got several clumps of tripe in my Pho) also I kept looking at the splatters on the wall and smelling that sour smell.  The price was a bit more than I'm used to for Pho, the somewhat flat soda really overpriced ($2.50).  While there are things on their menu I would like to come back and try, I just can't get past the uncleanliness in the eating area.  If it's that bad where customers eat... how bad is it in the prep and cooking area.  I mean Pho 43 a True hole in the wall feels cleaner than this place.  And PT noodle is only 1-1/2 miles away and is impeccably clean.     I did appreciate the free wifi, but don't think I'll be going back here any time soon",

The soup and meat all taste fresh. Some pho places you know when the meat have been sitting out or old because you can taste it. If you ever want to eat pho or anything come here and eat. You will love the food and staff!!",

    "text": "Sooooooo.....I have mixed feelings. The first time I was here the pho beef broth was not screaming hot, was cloudy, but very tasty. Now I'm trying a pho with chicken broth and the broth is piping hot, clear and just as tasty. Each time I found the bowl size lacking but the amount of protein satiated me sufficiently each time soooooo maybe I am just being a little piggy??? Hahahahaha :D :D  Both times I noticed a good amount of the local Asian community frequenting this spot. For the area this is as authentic pho as you're going to get. I will be back for another visit soon.  Oh! And the 1 Merlot offered comes in at 13.5% which I was very happy about since my stomach was blech. And I see they have boba too so maybe I'll try that next time. If you are way out on the West Side try this place out!",

Other pho places have MUCH better quality pho and is MUCH cheaper. I wanted to like this place but just truly not a fan. This place is just okay - could be better but JUST okay.",

It's one of only a few businesses in operation in a large commercial square, but the square itself as well as this restaurant are clean and well-maintained. Inside, the atmosphere was cozy and the  very friendly server had me seated at once. I started with two very good grilled beef spring rolls, followed by pho with tripe, tendon, and meatballs. The flavor of the pho broth here is the cleanest and freshest I've had of all the Vietnamese restaurants I've tried in the Valley; there was no overpowering cinnamon flavor to hide the more delicate flavors such as lemongrass. The tendon was tender and the tripe was sliced into very thin strips, the way I like tripe in pho. I finished the meal with an avocado shake which was thick without being heavy and with just the right level of sweetness. Free WiFi was available, too. Though the prices are just a tad higher than in most Vietnamese restaurants, that is justified by the quality of the food, the service, and the atmosphere.",

The overall look of the restaurant inside is updated, attractive, and clean. The lady who took my payment inside was friendly but abandoned her post as soon as she handed me the receipt to sign, which I had to leave the signed copy next to the unattended cash register. The pho was delicious and full of all the flavors you want in a good pho. It was one of the best I've tried! I wish they offered chow mein on their menu. But since they don't, I ordered their chicken fried rice. It was just okay... it was a bit dry and lacking in flavor. But I will be back for their pho!",

The bowl of Pho was very small compared to other restaurants with a very small amount of rice noodles and meat! $7.25 for what should have been called a kids bowl. I never been to a Pho restaurant that was stingy with their rice noodles (which has to be one of the cheapest ingredients). I ate all my noodles within minutes and was still very hungry. The broth wasn't that great either. You can immediately tell just by looking if the broth is a good one and this one was a murky color with no richness to it. The spring rolls were really good, but they came with a few iceberg lettuce pieces, which were too small to use for wrapping  around my rolls. I won't return that's for sure.",

I normally Pho large bowl (its not large like Da Vang) but its okay, they offer fish sauce but you have to ask for it I also noticed that they don't really have that much topping, you have to understand that I'm Laos. Meaning our topping normally include fried garlic, green onion, chili oil sauce..etc...But over all this place is good and would recommend for Pho lover in the neighborhood. I'm actually going there right now..",

And drank all his water quickly.   Waiter never came by to refill, clear our appetizer dishes, or ask how we were doing until we were done our meal.  The appetizers were good spring rolls and egg rolls.  However the pho soup was a little bland..didn't have the deep bone flavor I'm used to and meat was tough and chewy.  Oh well...probably won't be coming back.",

Maybe I just got a not so good batch. I've had other dishes. All good (especially the noodles) except for this one egg noodle dish I had it to-go. Maybe cause it was to-go that it was not good since I didn't have a plate/bowl to put it in. When you order to-go there they give you the dish components separate for you to put together on a plate/bowl yourself at home. I ate at a park. This place has good noodle dishes.  For better pho and spring rolls go to Central King Egg Roll (AKA Pho King Eggroll) in Goodyear.",

That is not case at this place. It is newer, clean & the staff lovely. Loved the Beef Pho & spring rolls with BBQ meat! So yummy & on my side of town. I've been driving far & wide to what was the best Pho place in my opinion in town. However cleanliness, good Pho & on my side of town...

It's not much different than Central King Eggroll as far as the food goes...there's a few slight differences in their eggrolls and their meat is slightly thicker than Central King's. Get yourself a P7 (rare beef).  I had some issues with gallstones this last summer before having my gallbladder removed, so I was munching on their P14 (chicken) for awhile and it was just as tasty.  You basically can't go wrong with anything on their menu.    But I can tell you...the actual restaurant and the service is loads better!  We usually have the same waitress and she is someone that always deserves that 20% tip!  Try out their homemade lemonade...they had squeeze it and add a bit of soda water to it so there's a slight fizz to it.  Yum yum!    Each table also has a little button you can press when they are super slammed, but we have seriously never ever had a problem with service here unlike at Central King.  Don't forget either...there is a back room here so if it looks too crowded in the front, don't walk out!    I can literally eat Pho here once a week and still be totally fine!",

I have no idea what, but definitely misses something.  Definitely not the best I had but not bad at all!! Spring rolls are big and good. My daughter love the fried rolls.

As soon as I walked in I was greeted by name, and seated with my drink already there, within seconds my Veggie Pho and Veggie Spring Rolls (both vegan safe) were placed in front of me and I started immediately.   The portion size of everything was perfect and filling, the Pho was not greasy and the spring rolls were huge. Everything was worth the price I paid.  This place was also so clean you could eat off the floor, and I really appreciated that.  The service was 10/10 my waitress didn't bother me but also attended to me in the perfect manner, they have a CALL button at your booth.. They know customer service here!  The only one Con would be that for \"Dine In\" it was just a little too quiet, maybe play some music or the TV louder or something, but that's a very minimal almost nit picky complaint.  This was my first time coming here and nothing makes me happier than a positive first time dining experience, I absolutely WILL be returning to this place and bringing friends. I work in Sales and I have ALREADY referred customers. Try this place out!",

Their Thai tea and boba is good. It was hard to flag down our server for soy sauce. We asked for it and she forgot about it. 5 minutes later she remembered and brought it. I might be returning but I wouldn't give this pho restaurant 4 stars or more bc I don't think it deserves it. You will agree if you like your pho broth dark and more flavorful. This place isn't bad. It's just OK. I will be returning but I'm going to try something other than your pho.",

I always end up really full or asking for to-go boxes.  -Very courteous and professional wait staff. (Don't think they ever get the order wrong because they repeat it back to you to be sure. If you're new to Vietnamese food they'll walk you through or explain what items are but the menu is very detailed as well so you know exactly what you're ordering). -Clean restaurant (and I'm weird about things like that. To me, if the place is not clean the food isn't either) but SL is on point. -Kid friendly. I have a 7, 2 and 1 yr old and they love SL",

I had questions on the menu and they had the manager personally explain it to me. We got the egg rolls, PHO, and fried rice. Everything was delicious and we will definately be back again soon. They also took our order on a mini iPAD which made the food come out super fast and accurate.",

And the food...that's the best part of the experience. It was fresh, delicious and fast. The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. Like the environment. I wanted something new, different cheap. This was the perfect place. I will definitely be back!",

The food came out in a flash, too.  I had the shrimp, pork and sausage combo with an avocado shake with boba, and both were very good.  I'll definitely be back!",

The staff looked absolutely thrilled to have their new restaurant and they were just as friendly! Great food at great prices. Can't wait to try more on the menu!",
