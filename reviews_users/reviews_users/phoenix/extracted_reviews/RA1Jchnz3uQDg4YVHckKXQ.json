We each had a latte and I thought they were alright, very drinkable lattes, but they didn't have the most flavor of any latte I have had. The place is super cute, has a bike rack, and has tons of seating BUT I wish the coffee was a bit stronger. Despite this, I will probably come back here because it is very close to the house and it will do.",

Best coffee place in Phoenix!!",

Yeah, I'm that girl, you know, \"medium iced coffee with soy?\"  They've got some new people on staff, but so far they all seem awesome. This is my favorite neighborhood coffee shop. It has everything you could want from a local cafe without the self-righteous hipster attitude. (cough, Cartel, cough). Besides the quality of the drinks and food, the atmosphere is nice. They have free WiFi.  What I love most about Fair Trade is supporting the business. I have (newly-formed) friends who work there and love it. The management truly treats its staff great and really wants to cater to the downtown Phoenix community. The prices are good and comparable to any Starbucks, but the coffee is traded ethically and bought for a fair price, which makes me happy.  Psst... they also have poetry readings and open-mic nights.  The only thing I dislike is that Fair Trade started closing earlier :( I can't go there anymore when I need to pull an all-nighter.  Try it and love it.",

Although I am not  a vegan or vegetarian, it seems as though all of my friends choose to live the lifestyle and as long as the food is tasty I'm always up for something new.   This morning me and a mate, Cole decided to stop in for some breakfast. We both ordered the vegetarian hummus sandwich. I definitely recommend it however after 8 months in Australia, Im continuously disappointed with what us American's consider black coffee.   When simply ordering a long black in the states, it seems to be standard to get a cup of coffee from the pot when what I'm really looking for is a double shot of espresso with some extra water. This being said, food is great but coffee not so much.   I've been living downtown for only a number of days but am starting to love my community and plan on making this spot a regular breakfast destination.",

Never been there when it was busy so can not speak to how the service is in a pinch. They have been good when it was dead. Never had food. Nice atmosphere inside. I love that is it is not a major chain, which are dominant in PHX. This place is much better than any fast food coffee (starbuckle, etc.) and the basis of my review is comparing it to places like Intelligentsia or Blue Bottle or Stumptown.  Latte - 4 starts Cappuccino - 2 stars (too milky) Iced Coffee - 3 stars (a little bitter) Iced Latte - 3 stars (a little too much milk)",

    "text": "I had a brief stint in between meetings today and my caffeine withdrawals were kicking in. I wanted a coffee shop where I could get some work done, get a swift kick of energy and do so in a comfortable and local environment. I found that at Fair Trade.   Ever since attending DPJ's Radiate Phoenix Event where local coffee shop owners spoke about their brands, I've been eager to check out Fair Trade and today was the perfect excuse to do so. I walked inside and was immediately welcomed by the smell of freshly roasted coffee and the therapeutic sound of coffee shop chit chat and the grinder humming to the beat of a fresh cup 'o Joe. The girl at the counter was friendly, attentive and definitely knew her coffees. I was tempted to try the mocha chocolate latte on special, but the barista convinced me that the iced coffee with sugar free chocolate and nonfat milk was the way to go. I know not to question the expert so I went for it. Note to self... my intuition was correct. I will always take the baristas advice from now on. The iced coffee was refreshing, full of a much-needed caffeine kick and just what the energy bunny ordered.   I really like the character and environment at Fair Trade. The shop was packed with coffee drinkers, business folks and even friendly neighborhood policemen. I am pretty sure I saw a Pastor making his way through as well. With the dynamic group of visitors, the music was comforting but not distracting. I saw plenty of outdoor seating options but sadly, the 110 degree weather kept me from enjoying a fresh breeze today.  So in summary, I give Fair Trade two thumbs up (aka four stars) for the quality and comfort they provide to the coffee addict. I noticed some tasty food options as well and I plan on making my way back again very soon to check them all out! So thanks Fair Trade, for getting me rejuvenated while allowing me to do some work done during the busy workday!",

They have been playing the same terrible song for two hours. No joke. I'm not sure if this is a psych experiment or a cruel joke, but either way- holy @!$%.  2. I must have missed the sign saying, \"Burn-outs\" welcome & preferred. This is the oddest group of people ever. During the course of my visit, some random guy tried to \"save\" a really nice man who happens to be blind. Along with that, the man kept yelling to the counter, \"Did ya'll forget me?\" Answer- yes. He ordered breakfast and bacon 40 minutes earlier. Yikes.  So, I cannot recommend this spot unless you like torture, or you are a psych major and need to study some weirdos. Bring your DSM -IV and have a great time.",

The decor is comfortable and the seating options have something for everyone--plush couches and armchairs, smaller booths, a window bar, and desks for working and studying. The prices are on-par with your typical coffee chain...maybe just a touch more expensive.   My only qualm is that the straws are next to the register, but they deliver your drink to the end of the counter, which is where the lids are located. I always forget to grab a straw when I pay for my coffee and have to squeeze around customers in line to snag one. It just doesn't seem logical. Yeah, it's a very small thing, but drives me nuts!",

The hard part about the service at Fair Trade is that they are generally helpful and nice. Until they're not. An example: my fiancee and I were waiting for the light rail and decided to run across the street for a coffee and tea. The barista informed my fiancee that it would be 5 minutes for the tea to brew and as our train wasn't coming for 11 minutes later we said that wouldn't be a problem. 6 minutes in, the tea was just being started. We asked if that was our tea that she was starting just then and it was. We told her we couldn't wait another 5 minutes and she said she could just steep it for 2, it just wouldn't be as good. No offer of our money back or asking if we want something else, or even an apology. Just \"Enjoy this slightly worse tea.\" I know this doesn't sound like that bad of a situation, but it is 100% indicative of their service. When everything is fine it's fine. But when things aren't they're disrespectful and unhelpful.   (There is a much better example of this but it is already mentioned in another review)",

    "text": "I spend close to $150 here a month with all the coffees, pastries, and breakfasts I get for my boyfriend and me every morning. The ONLY thing that kept me coming back was the taste of their drinks.  It always takes at least 15 minutes to get a drink if I order anything for more than myself. Today was especially worse because I had noticed that they had served someone their coffee before mine, who's order was taken after my drinks we being started. This wouldn't have bothered me if they hadn't messed up my drinks. I order smalls every time because I like the flavor. And one particular employee there always gives me a larger size. I don't always notice because I have nothing to compare until I have my coffee in hand.  Aside from that this place is also inconsistent. Sometimes I can get my drink made a certain way and other times I can't. This place is also extremely slow, which may be because they are understaffed- I don't know. They could use some help being more efficient with the people who do work there though.   Sadly this place has lost me as a regular.",

I had the French press, and even though it was just a regular old coffee, it was incredible. By regular I mean non-latte or anything like that. It was honestly what heaven tastes like, one of the absolute BEST coffees I've had in phoenix since moving here, possibly the best.  For breakfast I ordered the biscuits and gravy and being greedy and hungry went for the full instead of the half. I think I would have been satiated with the half though, it is rather filling.  It did take a whole to come out but I was able to sit by the adorable fountain in the lovely courtyard and I barely even noticed the time lapse.   The biscuits and gravy were awesome! Just enough sauce so it wasn't making the biscuits too soggy but they were still smothered. They sprinkle cinnamon on top and that enhances the flavor.  The staff was friendly and the wifi was free, the ambiance was slightly hipster but very relaxing and just like a coffee shop for everyone. I will be coming back here again for sure and I think before I leave I will get another coffee to go!",

The vibe is great for 20somethings like us but there were plenty of 30somethings in there who seemed to be enjoying themselves too! The coffee is a great price and has been delicious every time I've ordered it. They have these stuffed croissants that are heavenly. Great ice cream too.  I love that it's never too crowded.  The ONE thing I would say (which honestly isn't a problem for us because we're never in a hurry, but could be a problem if we were going to work or trying to catch the lightrail) is that it does move a little slow. There's usually only 1 or two people making drinks/serving/getting ice cream/whatever so it can sometimes take between 7-10 minutes to get your coffee. But if you're in no rush like me, it shouldn't bother you :)  I highly recommend this place if you're meeting someone for coffee, studying alone, studying in a group... anything really! Thanks Fair Trade :)",

It is hard going to other coffee shops and having the coffee when fair trade is the best.      They can get busy on the weekends,  but it is well worth the wait.   the coffee is fresh every time I have it. I could either be there in the morning or late at night and it is always fresh and good.    Another note is that I have never drank coffee black until I came to Fair Trade.  Now that just tells you that the coffee is good.  If I can drink it black.  :)    Well,  if you are in downtown on a first Friday or just in the area you should come by fair trade and check it out.",

(yes, you can cut through the parking garage and come in the back, instead of walking the whole way around like an idiot...like i might have done.)  the pricing is right for their beverages and aside from being involved in fair trade, they also like the environment. they've got a spot for you to put your sleeves to be used again. brilliant.  the only reason i'm giving it four instead of five stars is because i had to go to the bathroom really badly and i couldn't use it because someone was in it for a good 20 minutes while i was waiting and i had to wait even longer and use it at the next place because i was scared to go in, at that point. not their fault.",

They have a nice selection of bakery choices and again always some thing for vegans on offer. And very tastey. And if you werent wanting all the sugar they offer bagels. The place it self is very comfortable table seating or sofa recliner type seating. So if you wanted to get some work done you could or if you just wanted to relax you could do that as well. Inside seating as well as outside patio seating.   We would go here a lot. It was a nice place to come to after work for a coffee and a chat. Before heading home. Another really nice thing about Fair Trade Cafe. Very relaxing atmosphere.   A big plus they always have vegan options avaible for all of their food choices. And it is never just toast and jam.  A well made thought out vegan sandwhich or salad or plate. And they serve a side item with your order at no extra charge. Refill coffees were if i remember correctly .75cents or 1dollar.   Fair Trade Cafe is one of the best Cafes in Phoenix",

    "text": "Great cafes are one of my favorite things. Good coffee is just one of the required features that these spots must have. There are relaxation factors, the accommodations themselves, the vibe, the clientele, etc. Fair Trade definitely has passed the test with most of these factors...therefore placing it high on my list of favorite things!  The cafe is located in the Arts District right along Roosevelt. It's right across the street from a train stop, so it's real convenient! Once inside, the vibe is pretty cool. There are plenty of tables and plenty of bars along the windows for a good view while you drink your espressos. Paintings line the walls sparingly, giving it a artsy kind of vibe, while at the same time not going overboard with it.  I ordered a vanilla latte with almond milk and stood around and waited. The menu looked real interesting, and when I go back, I'll definitely give some of their food a try. It seems as if they had a lot of veggie and vegan options which is always awesome. There were a few people scattered here and there around the place..I could totally see this spot being packed or close to being full on a regular basis. I got my beverage and headed outside to one of the many tables out front. They also have a back entrance which also has more outside seating as well.   My latte had a nice, strong flavor balanced with the nice, sweet flavor of the almond milk. It was a perfect mix...not too much of either elements. I sat...relaxed....and watched the traffic pass by as I cleared my head.   Nice location...nice coffee.",

    "text": "I consider myself a regular at Fair Trade because I live in the attached apartment complex and I wish I could justify rating them more than 3 stars. Although I much prefer Fair Trade over Lola (just down the street), they need to just get it together here!!  They are understaffed every single time I go in. Sometimes I feel horrible for the employees because they are taking orders, making drinks, cooking, cleaning and who knows what else.   If i order anything besides regular coffee, it takes about 10 min to get my drink. If I order food (even just a plain toasted bagel with cream cheese) it takes no less than 15 min. I wish this was not the case because I would love to stop in here for a latte before work! This is a place I only go when i have a little extra time on the weekends.   They recently gave themselves an internal face lift which looks amazing! New couches, chairs, art. I also love how they always have fresh flowers around the shop. An employee told me that the owner gets the flowers and arranges them herself- awesome personal touch! The crowd in here is the best. Down to earth!! which is a breathe of fresh air when compared to other shops around (Lola, Songbird, Lux).   I will continue to frequent Fair Trade but please hire more employees so your current wonderful employees are not in over their heads and you can provide better customer service.",

Fair Trade started my day in a great note with a smooth roast and a generous dose over ice. I was appreciative of the cup and moved to buy breakfast for a stranger in the spirit of paying generosity forward. Thank you Fair Trade Cafe! The cafe is comfy, welcoming and so convenient for walkers, light rail riders and even drivers. My croissant was delectable and made to order. Go, get a satisfying cup and feel good at Fair Trade.",

The know us, they welcome us, and it is truly our Sunday group's home.  My favorites drinks are the almond milk vanilla latte, (my wake-up rock star) as well as the almond coconut tea, (for a relax chill). The smoothies are perfect for summer. (Purple Haze is popular in our group)  Don't miss the turkey and cheddar stuffed croissants. I am also partial to their home made egg salad and fresh bagels. Lots of delicious dessert choices.  Bottom line, this cafe provides perfectly brewed coffee, fresh food, comfortable seats, and goes far and beyond to make their customers feel welcome. The best of all worlds when looking for a cafe.

Their coffee is delicious, the pastries are divine and their sandwiches were my go to for a quick lunch or light dinner. My favorite was their grilled cheese panini with carrots. First off, they give you carrot sticks, not horrible baby carrots. Second the bread was a yummy focaccia style bread that held up well under the panini press. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. And if you didn't want coffee to drink there were always two kinds of ice tea to choose from. Why did I move to Tempe again? Oh right, boyfriend. :)   If they have peanut butter chocolate chip cookies when you visit you must try them! They're so good! They hit the sweet spot between crispy and moist with just the perfect amount of peanut butter and enough chocolate not to be overwhelmed by each. And they're small enough that you can eat one for a little something sweet or have two and not feel like you completely gave up on your diet.   I loved the mix of clientele that would frequent the Fair Trade Cafe. Downtown Phoenix is such a melting pot of different lifestyles. Having a conversation with the table next to you was always an adventure because you could meet anyone from CEOs to college students.   When the weather is nice, you should try to sit out back in the little courtyard if you can find a seat.",

    "text": "Lately, I have noticed that there are tons of coffee shops opening in central phoenix, and a few selections in the downtown area. I would have to say that Fair Trade Cafe is definitely has become my go to coffee shop because compared to others, it brings quality drinks and foods, we well as the atmosphere being serene to having different artwork being displayed. When I first discovered this cafe, I was intrigued by the motto and the fact that they are locally owned to always feeling welcomed, no matter what time of day I go. It's also a great cause for the owner to being direct fair trade, mainly because it shows in the taste of all their drinks and compensation towards the farmer, to opting into the organic movement and having different vegan options. Any time of day I enter this place, it is never full (unless it's the afternoon on a weekend or First Friday) that provides different types of sitting areas, with them providing trendy music and the artwork is always a great view. I have noticed that maybe every month of twice a month, the art is switched out which is so refreshing but I do wish there was more information on each artwork on their website(s) and whom they are presenting. I have never stopped by this place during First Friday because it ALWAYS seems to be full of capacity and loud, because of the DJ, but one day I do plan to just so I can walk around with a drink. I, personally, find this great of where it's located and the products they provide, especially, the top quality. I have moved out of the vicinity, for now, but do plan to move back to downtown and cannot wait to be a regular again!",

The coffee in the chai was also very good, not bitter at all- just smooth. It tasted better than Starbuck's chai latte for sure! The service was pretty quick too. My order was done in  2 mins. However I can see how people think it's pretty expensive. It is pretty pricey, but it makes sense since it's 'fair trade coffee'. But I enjoyed the vibe there and its location is very convenient. I'll definitely be back since I liked the taste of the coffee so much! Oh, and they had a clean bathroom! That's a huge plus in my book!",

I'd had delicious coffee and wonderful service at the Roosevelt location, but  didn't even know about the other one, despite living down the street. One Sunday night I just wanted to get out of my apartment and I started walking. My wanderings eventually led me to Civic Space Park, where I'd watched Christmas movies and people before. I smelled something wonderful, saw the sign for Fair Trade and took the steps down to the entrance.  When I walked through the door, I was greeted by a woman (Ingrid) that informed me that the cafe was closed but that they were just about ready to have community dinner. Seriously, I just started crying. I was feeling very alone downtown since all of my friends and family live in the suburbs, and finding this wonderful thing was incredible.   Ingrid and her husband Daniel put out a great spread every Sunday around 6-6:30. The food is all vegan/vegetarian and delicious. You pay if you can but if you can't, you're still welcome to enjoy dinner. Daniel and Ingrid seem to attract forward-thinking artistic types so the conversation is always stimulating and wonderful. I generally try to stay and clean up afterward, especially if it happens to be a night when I've thrown less than a good amount of money into the pot. Even this is enjoyable because the sense of community is there.   I cannot recommend this highly enough, especially if you happen to be a displaced former suburbanite that is looking for a great downtown community!",

I can even crawl with my pajamas to get my cup of joe in the morning...in which I did.   The coffee shop uses coffee beans that are Fair-trade certified. \"For a good cup of coffee, you gotta love that!\"  I was here every morning for my two-day stay for just a 16oz cup of coffee for $2.00. I love the coffee here and by a landslide, it sure beats drinking the beverage from the hotel.  This coffee-shop is also Eco-friendly; a definite plus.   Despite the quiet area especially at night, the hours are great (closes nightly at 10pm).  Free Wi-fi are available.  Inside is a great place to study for ASU students  A nice shaded and cool patio to lounge or handle your business.    I feel like home here with the friendly staffs and they treated me very well too, despite coming here three times for just a cup of coffee (twice in the morning and once in the afternoon). \"Hey you buy anything, you're automatically their friend(s). That is how I look at it!\"  If I come back to Phoenix, this will be my coffee-shop. And obviously, I need to show them some more \"love\" and get other items with my cup of coffee.",

Fair Trade's decor is BLAND and last time I went there the Barista was less than personable.  Also they lack the electrical outlets at every table which at this late state in the game is a fail for any coffeehouse.",

I found the staff friendly - especially Shane, who flirted with me and talked my ear off about all of the upcoming events; parking was a breeze in the adjacent lot; and although the place was packed, my friend and I scored a table outside... (good thing it wasn't crazy hot out just yet).  I'll be back soon to try more than the iced tea that I had the other day... the pastries looked awesome and I need to go explore everything else that Fair Trade has to offer.  I see a future Yelp Office Hours happening at Fair Trade for sure!  Let me know if you'd be up for that?!",

The food and beverages offered are some great choices, including delicious vegan brownies and a tasty veggie sandwich.  The tea was good as well. I have not tried the coffee.  The prices were about average for a place such as this.   The free Wi Fi is nice, and I love how close it is to where I live. Supposedly there are small discounts if you live at the Roosevelt Square Apartments and/or ASU student, but I've mentioned that each time and have not received discounts.   The seating can be variable, depending on the day/time that you go. I have found seating sometimes, but other times was at a wobbly table and ended up leaving (it was the only one available).  In the later afternoon/evenings, it can get a bit more crowded and harder to find seats.",

    "text": "Given that I went to the Downtown Phoenix Public Market without any caffeination whatsoever, I was in a pretty gnarled state by the end of my tomato buying excursion. I wanted to sit and cool down somewhere and have some coffee. I immediately thought of all my regular coffee joints, but since I was already in this neck of the woods, I thought I'd check to see if Fair Trade was open.  Now, it's not the first time I've attempted to go to Fair Trade. I've tried several times before on weekends, and they've always been closed. And I'd forget their hours and then try again and...still closed.  But today? Open! So for all you people, at least at noon on Saturdays, this joint's doors are unlocked.   I walked in and surveyed the scene. I definitely got a Berkeley earth mother vibe, which I didn't really expect to get in downtown Phoenix, but this town never ceases to surprise me one way or the other. I can't remember all the stuff they had to offer for sale besides their coffee products, but I do remember it appealing much to yogacentric ladies (not that there's anything wrong with that).  Ok, survey over, I still needed caffeine. I looked at their menu. The sizes for their coffee drinks: large, grande, venti. Are you kidding me? Why would a coffeehouse, called Fair Trade Cafe of all things, choose to label its cup sizes after Starbucks?  Beats me.  \"I'd like a small hot coffee and a large iced chai. And I want the chai with soy, if you can make it.\"  \"Sure, no prob.\"  Now I know it sounds bizzarre to you, but I needed the hot coffee to wake me up (iced coffee does nothing). But then I wanted something to cool me down. Plus I saw people drinking iced chai at the farmers market and it looked good. And I never drink chai at coffeehouses, hot or iced, so I thought why not today?  I then sat down with my two drinks on the couch and read the NY Times. In a relaxed state. And tasted my drinks.  I'd say the coffee was good, but the iced soy chai was excellent. I kept switching back between sips of each. I guess I'm weird. Or maybe I was just hot from walking around in 100 degrees for an hour. Who knows.  I sat there for a while reading, and I noticed out of 9 patrons there I was the only guy in the entire joint, so maybe it is an earth mother establishment after all. No Sarah Maclachlan on the soundsystem, though. Actually, no music at all. I know that there's no rule governing coffeehouses and whether they should have music (either live or on the stereo) on at all times, but it did seem a little silent, apart from the quiet chattering at the other tables.  I'd say all in all Fair Trade is a good place in a great location and uses best practices to obtain quality coffee (including Pura Vida Coffee and Just Coffee, which comes from a co-op of 50 families in Chiapas, Mexico), but man, if they were only open throughout the weekends and into the evenings, downtown would definitely benefit. I'm not sure if the adjacent Trinity Episcopal Cathedral actually owns the cafe or not, but I didn't get any religious vibe from the joint while I was there.  So, 3 stars for now. Maybe I'll bump up the star wattage in the future. Whenever I find them open again, that is.",

They've got a stereotypical hipster vibe with mismatched furniture, assorted lighting fixtures, rotating artists featured on the walls, beautiful murals--and they really pull it off!!   Their raspberry honeybush iced tea is AMAZING, and if you pardon the weird description I also reccommend their sugar cookies that taste a little reminiscent of homemade playdough. (Don't let that make you doubt my iced tea rec. IT'S REALLY GOOD JUST TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH.)  I bumped them up from 4 to 5 stars because of their very clean and maintained gender neutral restrooms. Sincerely, thank you for that!",

Fair Trade Cafe  is small but they have a shaded patio in the back, with a fountain, it is a really nice area to sit down and just relax.  The Fair Trade Cafe has a rather strange menu that would certainly lean towards the healthy, vegan crowd.  However, I was able to find a ham and cheese sandwich and latte, that were tasty and the bajed goods are definitely worth trying.  The servers are nice, however, service can be  slow at times. If you're ever in the area you should give it a try you won't be disappointed.",

Come because you're looking for culture, stay because...well, the product is actually really good.   I didn't even order the coffee my first time. Just a smoothie. No regrets, it's really good stuff. But as countless other reviewers will point out, the brew itself isn't bad. At all. I had a simple cafe au lait, and it didn't disappoint at all. I don't recall their roasts, I just know they're top notch, so feel confident stopping by.  There's some comfy seating to be had, but expect serious looking people on their Macs to hog entire couches or tables. On every visit I've found this to be a quiet, even solemn place for many of the valley's professionals to stress over their reports in public. That's good for many, but I can only hope Fair Trade spices things up with some more local flavor than the tasteful art adorning its walls.   In closing, I'll simply say you can't go wrong here. Enjoy!",

Today will be the last time my Mother and I go in here because this morning their staff was shorted and the barista was very annoyed and took it out on my Mother by giving us a terrible attitude. Today we had to go to an AA meeting and met up at Fairtrade to get a Lyft. The barista served us coffee that we didn't even order and when we told her we were waiting for our ride she got mad and threw her hands up and gave us so much attitude that we just left feeling very badly. It's like she passed her negativity straight on us.   So I'd like to give praise to locally owned coffee shops and I have been an avid customer here for almost a decade, sadly today I won't be going back ever.

The wrap was fresh and soft with a soft aftertaste of spinach which was good on my palate. The turkey was also tasty and fresh. The vegetables did not overpower the overall combination of tastes. I enjoyed the wrap very much. The service was great as well, very talkative and responsive to what I was saying. I felt comfortable with the cliental as well. I will recommend this cafe to my friends and co-workers and post it's where-a-bouts on Facebook, Twitter and instagram!",

The decor inside is decent and comfortable.  The music is also  set an an acceptable volume.   I've had the ice latte twice and hot drip coffee once. They're both okay - nothing I'll crave later on.   The breakfast sandwich is ok, but not great - a bit expensive at $6.75. It should be $5 tops. The ham and cheese breakfast sandwich is very bland. Instead of a think slice, there was a huge slab of ham on top of a small amount of scrambled egg and I could barely see any cheese. There was no sauce, so it was very dry. I completely took out the ham and only ate the rest because I hadn't eaten in almost 18 hours (doing intermittent fasting).   Lastly, the last 2 times I've been here, the WIFI has been terrible. In fact, I'm using my hotspot data from my phone to write this review on-site on my iPad. I can't get YouTube videos to play, access many APPS, email, or APP store.",

It's easily accessible from the light rail, sits right on the northern edge of downtown, is close to the public market and contributes to growing number of businesses in the area. Its point-of-sale is a bit on the pricey side, but it's a nice place regardless. If I were downtown and wanted coffee, this would be my preferred choice. If I wanted to go out for coffee in any neighborhood, I would likely bypass this shop for Copper Star, Hob Nob's or the Lux. Patrons will notice Fair Trade's odd use of angles, industrial interior and UV-heavy lighting with windows that seem to magnify the sun's brightness. I do like it and would go back again, but in general it isn't my preference.",

I came back even after I paid almost $5 (including student discount) for my soy vanilla latte only to leave because it was too pack to find a comfortable seat. The downtown location brought me back and this time I was lucky to find a seat right next to the front door where I could see the Roosevelt portion of the light rail. Definitely the downtown feel. I ordered a soy latte and I almost asked for more espresso with my soy because it tasted more like coffee flavored milk than anything else. After a few hours of studying I ordered a turkey sandwich which wasn't too bad but couldn't make up for the lack of caffeine in my system. Sorry, fair trade but I tried. Until we meet again.",

Reading books and drinking coffee is like my 3rd job, and I prefer to do it at my neighborhood cafe.   If I want drip coffee (which is almost always) I will go out of my way to come here. It's simply delicious. If I want something else I might go elsewhere, but nothing else in central/uptown/downtown Phoenix can compare to a Fair Trade Iced coffee.   The barista's are sweet, the live music on Saturday afternoons is a joy, the community computer has saved my ass at least a dozen times, it's \"coffee with a conscience\", and it's a 2 minute walk from my apartment. Of course it gets 5 stars!",

The chicken curry was excellent, and the bread it was on was almost as much of a treat.  My son devoured the grilled cheese, which was also on the same multi grain bread as mine, though toasted,  We enjoyed hanging out in the courtyard behind the cafe, which has a fountain, and very relaxing atmosphere.  All in all, a very pleasant experience with very good, reasonably priced food.  I'll definitely be making this place a regular stop.",

Seems like a lot of the workers & patrons are feminists which is awesome (especially since I'm living in Utah right now with a SERIOUS dearth of feminists among other politically active people!), but on the other hand there is a pretty distinct yuppie feeling to the place - but that is probably due to it's downtown location.  The barista's were all very friendly & helpful. They pull good shots of espresso and are pretty attentive to details.  Odd detail I noticed and thought was pretty cool: their bathrooms are exceptionally clean, consistently.  There is a lot of local (assumption) artwork for sale in the cafe that is quite nice - adds a good feel to it having dresses, sculptures, etc on the walls that is not only pleasant to look at but available to buy.

    "text": "I never really rate coffee houses based on their bean juice, rather convenience, proximity, and ambiance.  For me, Fair Trade rates highly in all three of those categories.    Convenience:  Its centralized but more accessible by foot, which is the penultimate mark of a legitimate urban coffee joint, second only to the taste of their drip coffee.  Walking to your favorite coffee house is one of the great simple pleasures of life.  While this isn't my favorite coffee shop, its a suitable filler when drives to Copper Star or Paisley aren't in the cards.  Proximity:  The downtown Roosevelt Row area, which is crawling with people who enjoy $5 cups of coffee and like to support a cause 'they hear' is pretty good.    Ambiance:  Much like other businesses along the Deck Central Area, Fair Trade struggles with Airport Lobby Pandemic.  They have, however, 'warmed' it up with corral walls, typical coffeehouse art, propaganda fliers, the token 'Monkey Che' t-shirt urbanite, and the sans-shower barista.  It feels like a nice place to stay a little longer.  The rear patio is nice and shaded, but if the bright ass reflection of concrete doesn't bother you, then I recommend the bustle of the front patio, as it provides the illusion of a brisk metropolis at the gateway to downtown PHX.",

I have no idea what impression they think that produces in customers, but I left without being served and I wonder if I should ever return. I have no interest in patronizing a coffee shop that doesn't have a sense of customer service. I will think very hard about going back, which is too bad considering the many days I've spent there.",

    "text": "I love Fair Trade. That about sums it up. However, if I wrote this review a year ago, which I did but never posted, I would have given them 5 stars. I still love them though.   It is located a stone's throw away from where I live and I can often be found there. I actually haven't sampled the coffee, I don't drink the stuff, but my husband enjoys it. I do love the iced tea, hot chocolate, and hot teas. The sandwiches are great and the baked goods are amazing, save the bagels. (They are from Chompie's) I love the filled croissants. In recent months, their quiches had begun to get really salty and they took them off the menu and replaced them with frittatas, which look exactly like the quiches. I actually asked where the egg was when I ordered my first one. Their Sunday brunch is great (love the chili cheese egg puff or whatever its called and the sweet potatoes mixed in with the side of potatoes is great!) when I don't feel like going out to a sit down brunch and just want to run and get something quickly, they are the only place in this neighborhood that provides that on a Sunday morning...there are no bagel shops or anything. What I like most about Fair Trade is that if you are there to do work you can literally sit there all day and be able to have lunch, unlike at other coffee shops where the food sampling is limited to various baked goods. With the soups, salads, and sandwiches Fair Trade really functions more as a cafe.   Service is always friendly; however, lately it hasn't been as on point as it once was. I wonder if they sent the more experience people to the new location and have all the newbies at this location. The rotating art is fun and a great resource for local artists to get their work out there. The new furniture they have put in is a little out of place and does make it feel overly cramped and hot at times though.   They participate in First Fridays and host poetry slams and sushi nights. They let me sit on the patio with my dog and bring her water and dog treats. Free wifi, free garage parking...does it get better?",

    "text": "Truth be told, I have a history here.  Well, sort of.  I've known Michelle the original founder of Fair Trade for a long time.  Michelle planted this coffee shop in this hidden corner of Downtown Phoenix long before Roosevelt Row had fully re-emerged from its dark troubled times.  It was no guarantee that Fair Trade was going to make it back then, but the formula and the sustainable cause she championed won over the neighborhood.  Back then Fair Trade was something of a survivor.  Today, Fair Trade is a neighborhood staple with the original location here and another location next to ASU's Downtown campus.    As per my previous reviews I am most definitely not a coffee drinker, but I'll happily frequent a coffee shop if they offer decent food and a good place to hangout.  On these fronts, Fair Trade will certainly satisfy.  I've had several of their breakfast and lunch sandwiches (the Turkey being my personal favorite) and I've also stopped in often for something simple like a bagel or a yogurt parfait.  But perhaps the most underrated thing here is the ice cream.  Fair Trade doesn't really advertise it and you could easily pass by the ice cream case without noticing. But from my experience, its worth your taste buds.  Their flavors rotate regularly so what you see this visit could be different the next.    Tonight I was on something of a dessert prowl for First Friday in Downtown and Fair Trade just happens to be near my apartment.  Sooo, yeah.  A little ice cream starter here seemed like a good idea.  And it was.  Tonight I went with a couple of scoops of their cookies and cream.  Super cheap at just $3.  Really delish.  Pretty sure the butterfat ratio on this version is high enough that I shouldn't take a liking to it too often, but a really great rendition nevertheless.  A perfect way to start the evening (after an earlier dinner of course, but I digress).  The vibe at Fair Trade is as laid back as its always been.  With art dotting the walls and comfortable spots to sit both inside, out front, and even in the courtyard out back.  Fair Trade has always been popular with the local artists and in recent years has become a popular study hangout for the downtown college crowd.  Some because they love the coffee, some because of its arc towards sustainability, and for some its just comfortable.  And perhaps that's the best tribute to Michelle's efforts here.  Its just comfortable here.  Relaxed, unpretentious, and welcoming.  Good work Michelle, good work.",

Lots of wooden tables that can fit 6 people a table and there are 3 seaters and 2 seater tables as well or tables you can share with other people at the coffee shop. Just want comfortable seats to chill and sit with chairs side by side if you just want to come and chit chat with a friend or take a date here.   I ordered a decaf vanilla latte with coconut milk. It's my off coffee day, but I wanted to check out this place and get out a bit. They have other milk alternatives like almond milk, soy milk.   It's located in downtown and there are free 2 hour street parking spots. Nature calls? No problem, they have huge metal spoons to the far left of the register counter for the unisex restrooms #1 & 2. A little embarrassing to carry and not sure if I like the idea of touching it after getting out of  (Like how many people don't wash their hands after leaving holding those keys). They currently have condiment squeeze bottle that contains soap next to the sink. Not sure if it's good soap like natural, cruelty free, or organic essential oils, it would be nice if they switched it out with a nice soap dispenser or one with a label telling you what's in it to go with their brand experience.  There is music playing above and it's at a good volume so you don't have to yell. While I was here, they played some old classics. Very Coast.   If you are sitting near the window you'll see benches for public transportation and there's an outlet extension with six slots for your laptop or other devices. There's also an outlet extension towards the back wall to the left of the window seating area. You just have to bring your own charger.",

Standing there after five minutes someone walked by with a key to open the bathroom doors, which made me feel ignored by the baristas in this cafe. Though this was likely the fault of a single person it still was frustrating.  The prior experience caused a rating of three stars, but since both the brewing urns for coffee were blinking (meaning these coffees were cold) I will have to bring it down to two stars.

The coffee is tasty, they usually have a decent selection of tea, and their baked goods are fresh.  There is plenty of parking in the attached covered lot, and there's outdoor seating in both the front and back. The indoor seating is ample and comfortable. The tables and bathrooms are clean. It's downtown, and it's not Starbucks - IE the coffee is good and not burnt.  I'm a fan!",

    "text": "Fair Trade is a cafe right off of Central and Roosevelt in downtown Phoenix. It purports to be a supporter of \"sustainable living through economic growth.\" By being \"Fair Trade Certified\", this venue agrees to the following principles taken from the Transfair USA website:  * Fair price: Democratically organized farmer groups receive a guaranteed minimum floor price and an additional premium for certified organic products.   * Fair labor conditions: Workers on Fair Trade farms enjoy freedom of association, safe working conditions, and living wages. Forced child labor is strictly prohibited.   * Direct trade: With Fair Trade, importers purchase from Fair Trade producer groups as directly as possible, eliminating unnecessary middlemen...   I guess that's cool.   I'm writing this seated at one of its tables, supposedly to get some work done (free wifi). It's got a nice, direct view of our downtown skyline. Light guitar music in the background. Light lunch fare is available, and I just finished a very sloppy, but good, egg salad sandwhich. The crowd here actually seems somewhat ASU-ish. In fact some guy came up to me when I first sat down and asked me to take a sociological survey as part of some ASU study (he was here with the cafe's permission).   It is a bit hard to find with the light rail construction chaos. But there is a very nice private and free parking garage directly adjacent to it. Find that, and you're golden.  The hours are decent. Open on this Sunday from 7 am to 7 pm. I still wish more of these Phoenix area cafes would get with the program and give late night owls like me somewhere to go after 10. If Tucson can do it, folks, so can you.",

Comfortable atmosphere and seating, friendly service, clean facility, wifi worked great, no complaints!!  As an added bonus, our server handed out free baseball tickets to the D-backs / Pirates on a day when we actually could make the time to go!!! (How often does that happen??)",

I forget the name of the dish I had, but it was sort of like a frittata with sour cream and fresh salsa.  It was awesome.  And it was only like $5 and came with rosemary potatoes.  Mmmm.  I brought my dog with me and they were super cool about it.  They brought the food out to me in the courtyard and even brought a milk bone and bowl of water for the dog.",

I first discovered Fair Trade through one of the owners, who also happens to volunteer for the organization I work for. (Remember I said my job would be important to the story?) I came in a few times and was continually impressed with the friendly staff, great coffee, and overall great atmosphere.   Because of my job (and lack of office space) I have a LOT of coffee meetings. Sometimes it's all I ever do. And FTC is a great location, and it's way cooler than Starbucks. So my coworkers and I definitely give them a ton of business with our meetings!   The Sunday brunch is awesome, everyone must try the egg puff and the potatoes, they are to die for. It's a great way to spend a Sunday morning!  The free WiFi is also awesome when I need a Central location to work. Sometimes I refer to it as my office.   Lastly, Fair Trade donated coffee to the annual fundraising event that our organization holds annually. It's just a wonderful testament to how community oriented the staff and owners are, and how great Fair Trade is for downtown Phoenix!",

On Sundays they have a brunch like menu, with eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, potatoes, etc. Nom nom.    I take issue with the fact that they don't brew their own iced tea. That may seem trivial, but they are a cafe, and so I think it's a cop out. The music is generally good, it's usually too loud to get work done. I would explore more of the options in the area, since there seems to be a lot.",

    "text": "So after multiple opportunities to go to Fair Trade Cafe, I FINALLY went and loved it.  Why was I taking so long in going? Not sure. But regret it.  It was First Friday, so very busy and very chilly, so I went actually a few times in one night.  First run was with the veggie soup, that was fabulous-- I can't wait to try other flavors.  Second run was a plain coffee and it was  tasty, not bitter- I drink coffee daily and often find it bitter at a lot of places. Third run was a mint tea- can't ever go wrong with mint tea.    Now coffee houses, in my opinion are based a lot on the employees/owners, the vibe and the other customers.  The employees were above and beyond kind and the vibe was cool and as the night went on, it got even more cool.  It was open mic night and people were reading poetry-- some better than others but my favorite was a humorous poet who had the whole room in stitches.   I've never been to an open mic poet night, it was interesting.  I was talking to my friend and I got shooshed and someone yelled \"MAN ON MIC!\" and I felt like a frickin' moron but whatever, I understand.  I was new-- I didn't know the rules.  Doesn't help that when I talk in general, I pretty much scream-- loud talker but that's because I come from a family of 4 kids and if you were quiet, you were never heard.    So, Fair Trade is 5 stars in my book.",

I love FT if just for their great selection of snacks that make the perfect companion to a mug of coffee, latte or even iced tea.  They always have a few different roasts brewed and waiting for a mug to call home. I enjoy lighter roasts - sorry I don't enjoy burnty coffee. And FT is quick to meet my desires! Mmm the Peruvian roast, how I love thee. And yes, students get a 10% discount. Plus all the coffee is certified Fair Trade (some are organic). Woo! However, I wish that they would also use Fair Trade chocolate for their Mochas etc, and since they don't it makes me a little sad.  They have started to have more and more fresh vegan pastries from their kitchen. I heard they just got a vegan pastries cookbook so I can't wait to see what kind of other treats they will have for me in the future.  The atmosphere here is usually mellow enough for me to be productive.. and I have been happy to be able to take advantage of their wifi this week, since I recently moved and have been without internet for a week.  The cafe is right next to the light rail stop at Roosevelt & Central (Arts District) so check it out if you're a rail rider on a leisure trip (weekend riders I'm talking to you).  Oh and everyone who works at FT is wonderfully pleasant. These girls (and one guy) have won my heart, that's for sure... or maybe it was the coffee that did it...",

The cafe was run by the church up until Julyish in answer to Mr. K's musing but they've been bought by a few of the regular customers and are enjoying a slow but steady revitalization along with a steady extension of hours.  They're also hopefully expanding they're menus to include more food food items as volume picks up.   Additionally, they offer only fair trade coffee and teas so you can do your part to help fair trade just by sipping at a cup of coffee.",

It's located in the Art District, so you'll have that sort of hippie-vibe with the decors, staff, and overall surrounding.  Parking garage has 2hr limit, so if you're planning to spend more time around, then I'd try street parking around the corner. The place is pretty populated from the time I came to the time I left- many people working/studying, some enjoying companying, and they have also various board games you can play with. The window overlooks Roosevelt w/ half-open drapes so you can people watch or get lost in thoughts.   Food/drink- they have breakfast items as well as sandwiches, wraps, appetizers. I tried the turkey wrap and found it okay. Like any other wrap, nothing extraordinary there. The food didn't leave a memorable taste for me. I also had the espresso which is like your ideal man: deep, dark, and strong. If you're a coffee person, I'd highly recommend.   The very unique and cute part of the place that is absolutely memorable is the bathroom. Oddly enough. It's like a walk-in closet bathroom, very homey and comfortable. Hippie-decors, of course. In the bathroom, they included envelopes and blank papers, and a note that says - take a moment to write something and we'll mail it for you. That's pretty entertaining and different. Much appreciated!",

I ordered a cherry Italian soda, which was ok. There was a little too much syrup for my tastes, but if you like yours very sweet, you'll love them here.  Though I got my cookie immediately, my drink was not made until I walked back up to the counter over 5 min later to remind them. They weren't particularly busy, so I was unimpressed with the service. However, the cashier was friendly and apologized.",

The location is also directly across a Metro Light Rail (street car) station, a GRID Bike sharing hub, and a few yards from another bus stop, so if you're a student without a car then you can rely on public transportation to and from this place.  The seating is adequate, but if you're planning on using this place as your studying cave for the majority of the day, I would recommend arriving early to obtain ample desk space and an outlet.  If you're like me and bring a power strip wherever you go, I would recommend bringing that with you as well.    10 / 10.  Great job and keep it up, Fair Trade Cafe!",

By the time I arrived at the Roosevelt/Central train station i was so parched i went to this Fair Trade, asked them if i could get a refill instead of wasting a cup, thinking i would pay for an entirely new Iced Tea, when she only charged me $.75. that was awesome!!! finally a place that is, well, Fair! they didn't have my favorite Banana Nut cookies, but that's okay i'll forgive them lol.   however if you ever see the banana nut cookies available, get them fast! they are the most tasty & moist little bites of heaven you will ever eat! this place also offers tons of vegan items.   they offer free wi-fi, have inside and outside seating both in front of the shop and in the courtyard right behind it too. ride a bike? you'll find 2 bike racks in front and back as well. you will also find handcrafted items to purchase from around the world, including music-which can be sampled on the sampler close to the courtyard. i can't get enough of their green tea, but the others are deolilcious too and at only $2.25, with a $.75 refill you can't go wrong. so next time you take the train into downtown, stop at the roosevelt/central station and get yourself some Fair Trade on!",

    "text": "Fair Trade Cafe is renowned in Phoenix as the premiere coffee shop in Downtown: a place to meet friends or make new ones, hear the eclectic but usually superior music choices of the friendly and colorful staff, and find an office-away-from-the-office. Fair Trade is definitely the favorite (non-Starbucks) choice of the young professional class when they need a \"mobile command center.\"   Any given day, a forest of open laptops can be found in the open and spacious interior, along with any number of business meetings in progress, lefty groups holding discussions and people just kicking back and having some really good coffee.  The drawbacks are a result of the success of Fair Trade - during the lunch rush, tables are at a premium, even those out front or in the courtyard it shares with the Portland Apartments.   However, the benefits more than make up for this occasional inconvenience. Among the staff, which in a constant state of flux but retains many excellent people on a regular basis, Meghan is at the top of the heap. She has never failed to impress me or my friends with her effervescent attitude and dedication to customer service. A smile and ever-handy kind word from her always help to make up for a down day. And when she and Christina, another Fair Trader with skill and know-how to spare, are teamed up, it is a dynamic duo to satisfy even the most demanding customer.  All in all, Fair Trade deserves its place as being synonymous with the Downtown Phoenix young professional scene, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who wants a laugh, great brew and relaxing ambiance served up together.",

Place was packed with people from 3 - 70 years old, originally- and trans-gendered, all shades of pink and brown, spread over every table inside and in both front and back patios, the three staff and proprietrix all running flat out, having a chance to catch up with a few visual and literary art friends while waiting.. There were two moms sitting across from me trying to shepherd 3 teensy ninas bursting with curiosity and energy who had me exploding in belly laughs by the time my takeout was ready - climbing up and over the couch, scrambling over the cookies on the plate, playing hide and seek with each other behind the legs of customers waiting to order, running in too many directions for the moms to follow, so one burst behind the counter as a staff member was finishing prepping her baby bottle. I suddenly realized I've been coming to this neighborhood social center across 3 decades now and never reviewed it before ... I love living where I do",

The downtown location has supplied some lovely frittata dates in the Civic Space by the Goofy LED Boners for me, but I can't ever seem to get a luscious pair of frittatas shaken in my face at this location anymore.  The chai is very inconsistent from day to day, but I still walk here and have one a day some weeks.  The smoothies taste like they're made with sugary purees; I'd still rock one on the rare days when I don't give a rat's damn about high sugar consumption.  I like the frequent drinker card and the adorable filing system at the register.  Must try their biscuits and gravy.  Breakfast is nextest.",

It's often difficult to find somewhere to sit and relax or sit and study. Which is even more frustrating. Obviously, that's great for them as it means their business is good but darn it, I want to sit my exhausted ass down!  I settle in at a table outside, which wobbles. Sigh.  I have never eaten anything here so I cannot comment on the quality or anything, but I do want to give props to the banana smoothie - a must!  They offer punch cards as well as discounts too. Once a $5 smoothie is now $4.50. Sweet.   Oh, and go on Mondays... it's \"double punch\" days! Those things add up fast and I generally save my smoothie for those days!",

I'm not a coffee drinker, but the mango smoothie is amazing and they are happy to make me a raspberry french soda when I ask.  I've had the chicken curry sandwich, as well as the hummus vegetable sandwich.  They are both solid choices, and are $6.50 a pop.  You can choose between a half or a whole, but the half is only $4.50 so it is wise to just get the whole and save it for later if your tummy is full after a half of a sandwich.  The people that work here are genuinely nice.  They smile, and try to get you what you need in an efficient manner.  They make you feel good about coming here.    Extra good touches:   There is a computer that they allow patrons to use. They have covered free parking available for their patrons. It is in front of the Central/Roosevelt light rail station.  The only reason that it is a four star joint for me is because the set up is a bit odd.  I have to plug in my laptop as the battery is shot and sometimes it is a tad difficult to get to a plug.  That is truly my only complaint, but Fair Trade is pretty solid in my book.",

Meh: the food. Now, granted, I haven't been for lunch, but the a.m. selection does not knock me out. I would think a place as hippie-dippie and crunchy granola as this would be somewhat into remotely healthy food. Instead there were lots of bagels, greasy croissants, etc. The only thing on my vegetarian, health-conscious radar was whole wheat banana bread, which was totally blah and not even really banana-y.  Boo: having to get a key to get into the bathroom. I understand the point, but as someone who will pee every hour for the entire duration of my stay, not cool. Boo: crappy LOUD Lilith Fair-esque music. Sorry, I left my strap-on at home. Maybe at night when people are just hanging the tunes would be ok, but in the morning I saw lots of poor downtrodden souls like me hunched over laptops, books, or in serious conversation with someone else in a business suit... people who were actually trying to, you know, WORK.  As much as I want to support independent businesses, I highly doubt I'll be back... there's just too many other great places to go.",

Fair Trade also gives out discounts for RS residents, Gov. employees, students, and seniors. as a resident of the apartment \"complex\" fair trade is in. i get my resident discount..i think it's 10%. which is nice because it brings the cost down below 2 bucks for a large coffee..i then feel more justified with the 1 dollar tip i usually leave.   1 star for good coffee  1 star for great employees  1 star for location  1 star for prices  1 star for convenience  ahhh i feel better now.",

I went back recently and wasn't very impressed, particularly with their vegan brownies which used to be amazing. However, the coffee is very good, the atmosphere is really nice. The food is SO GOOD. Curry chicken sandwich is my main go-to.  Another change that I noticed is their seating. Instead of individual tables and chairs, they now have a lot of bench-style seating along one of the walls. It looks really cool, but I feel like it's more crammed in there than it used to be. Furniture that they kept includes their chairs, which are super wobbly and kinda scary to sit in.  Overall great coffee shop, but not as comfortable as others in the area.",

I'm not addicted to coffee like sooome people, but I probably come here 4/7 days a week. Especially when it is so darn nice out and I can just stroll out my door and down Portland, cross the train tracks, ignoring the never-changing Don't Walk signs, and over to the angular little coffee shop downtowners know and love.  Not unlike so many of my reviews, I love this place for its proximity and my personal convenience! But that's not all! I love their brews, their coffee-sprucing counter of assorted sweeteners like agave nectar, the spinach and feta pastry thingies, the art, and the coffee shop version of Cheers-esque vibe. Like a morning migration of everyone from Bikini Lounge I saw the night before.   The workers are usually nice and there's usually somewhere for me to plug in and pretend to do homework. Don't forget the student discount! Hey and they give a shit about other people in the world! Fantastic.",

Quaint cafe, lots of seats, outdoor patio, plugs galore, cool art, chill vibe. Lots of syrup options (including sugar free) if you like flavored lattes. I appreciate that my latte was not drowning in syrup and the natural aroma and flavor of the coffee still shines ... not bitter at all, and I could taste the fruity elements of the bean. Usually, I have to mask coffee with milk and sugar at coffeehouses from poor preparation or overroasted bitter beans, but I'm actually quite excited to try their espresso next time (fingers crossed). Good sized food menu with a few surprising options that deviate from traditional cafe fare (e.g.: chicken curry sandwich). Oh, and on the subject of food, don't forget a vegan oatmeal cookie - they are perfectly sized for the \"treat yo self\" munchies!",

    "text": "I absolutely LOVE Fair Trade. It is very laid back and relaxed, but if you need a quick drink or snack they're great for that too. I love their coffee drinks, especially their French Press. I am a huge coffee drinker, and I'm being honest when I say their coffee is some of the best I've had. It's very fresh, but not at all too bold. For some reason, their hot drinks are better than their cold drinks. But all in all, they're delicious.  They also make really tasty pastries. I'm not sure if all of them are gluten-free, but there are some that I've seen. They also just got ice cream, which is perfect on a hot day.  The baristas are always really happy and helpful. Even though there are usually people in the cafe, it's a nice atmosphere. They also offer free Wifi and power outlets, so if you have a big cup of coffee and a laptop with a power cord you can spend hours there.  The only bad thing about Fair Trade is that sometimes it can get loud, especially there are a lot of people and if a barista wants to play loud music. It varies, based on what day and time you go in.   Overall, I love Fair Trade and I never say No when someone wants to go.",

But a little secret about this place - their gluten free chocolate chip & peanut butter cookies are TO DIE FOR. I seriously crave these little babies all the time. They are so moist, dense and sweet. They taste like cookie dough but they are entirely gluten free! I love that this place is hip and in the middle of the first friday happenings. I can walk here from my apartment, which is an added plus. Only knocking off a star because the seating options are sometimes underwhelming. Definitely more seating than Lola down the street, but sometimes the space is inefficiently used with one person per table. There is always outside seating (but it's so darn hot!)",

They always have the perfect iced tea or toddy brew coffee (for $2 or $2.50 a cup, which is definitely not bad at all), and the nearby Portland Parkway offers a beautiful outdoor seating area if theirs is already filled.  Other good things include: Gluten free chocolate chip peanut butter cookies, tuna melt, electricity plugs, wonderful music variety, ice cream. Sunday brunch is also worth checking out, but I do not recommend the biscuits and gravy if you happen to be a biscuit and gravy aficionado.  The only bad things: They're often busy, which is good for them, but bad for you if you need an electricity plug to charge your laptop.",

    "text": "I have been going to this place practically since it opened.  Was very intentional about continuing to go during light rail construction because it was important to me that they survive the construction and thrive as a business.  However, its' been a few months since I've gone downtown and so I haven't been in.  They've remodeled, I'm not crazy about the new seating they've chosen, but that's not really that big of a deal.  There were two people behind the counter, they were both standing there when I ordered a salad in a particular way because I have food related health issues. First, they took half an hour to make the salad (it was NOT busy in there!!), both of them delivered it, and the salad was made in the exactly the way that I had said not to do.   I pointed that fact out, one of them said, ok, we can just take that off of there, and I said no, you can't, you have to start over. One of them brought it back to me and there was clear evidence that I'd been ignored. The second time. No apology, no following directions, completely ignored me when I suggested that when people ask for things in a specific way, it's usually for a pretty important reason.   Sheesh, it's not McDonalds, they make stuff to order, they should be that much about customer service that she started over and didn't try to sneak something past me that is really important that I not eat.  I won't be going back.  This makes me sad.",

    "text": "This review is based on 50+ visits to Fair Trade.  Pro: It's a central meet up spot on Roosevelt Row. Lots of plugs, and non-distracting music. There are some larger tables, where groups love to convene.  Cons: Anything from the kitchen is over-priced, disappointing, and of such varying quality and portion. As a long-time supporter of downtown and a frequent patron of Fair Trade, I just need to be honest here. This is a frustrating reality. The veggie hummus plate regularly includes celery that has starting to become transparent (a clear sign that it should not be served to anyone). The cucumber is slimy (clearly not freshly cut, and starting to spoil). Also, an ice green ice tea and a \"tuna melt\" will cost you have $10, but there is often so little tuna and cheese that you can only taste the crumbling bread. I am hoping that Fair Trade reads this comment, and starts making half-decent quality food.",

I am willing to pay more for quality, and I do, but they are startlingly more expensive than any other coffee shop I've been to in Phoenix.  $6 & change for a medium latte?  Serious?  That's almost $2 more than Lux, you guys.  (edit: that's before the tip! cman! by the time I leave there, I've spent the better part of 10 bucks for a medium latte! do I look like Donald Trump to you? better not.)  It's really kind of outrageous.  Other than the weird location, I am sure the prices are why the place is always deadsville when I go.",

Great for a late night (or breakfast!) ice cream/gelato craving, which I have a little too often, & the peanut butter chocolate cookies are worth the trip alone. I have eaten here a couple of times, mostly because I was already there. Pretty good, local and made to order (so don't be in a hurry).  However... I have yet to have a good flavored latte, and the past couple of times I have waited at least 10-15 minutes for a couple of espressos and lattes. Milkshakes can be very watery and no bueno, depending on the barista. It is also pretty noisy, and sometimes has random theatrical/musical performances. I'm all for supporting the local arts, but it doesn't make for a quiet, productive atmosphere to get hyped up on caffeine and knock out some homework.   Bonus- Wifi, and the single shots of espresso are basically doubles.",

    "text": "Today I was feeling very sleepy so I sent a note to a colleague and asked if she wanted to go for coffee and she suggested FTC.  We got there and ordered our coffee and I decided to order a sandwich for my lunch later that day also.  While waiting for the coffee, the owner I can only assume stopped to talk to us. Under the cart she was pushing was a small child who reached up and essentially goosed my butt.  Not quite that far up but it was enough that I was so startled that it caused me to knock over my friend's coffee because I was just trying to stay away from this kid who more than likely would have done it again. I don't know if he thought I was his mom standing next to the cart or what, but it seriously spooked me. You just don't expect to be grabbed standing waiting for a sandwich.    Now I could forget all that if the sandwich were worth a damn, but it wasn't.  The bread was horribly dry, and dense. Someone mentioned earlier that there are no condiments, and they weren't kidding.  This sandwich was as dry as the Mohave desert.  I'd go back for coffee if it was the last place to go, but honestly for a better cup of coffee and a bite to take back to the office, Carly's or Hob Nobs is always a better option.",

The place was really cute, with a great selection off coffee and drinks to choose from.  The place has tons of seating, including a bunch of comfy looking couches and chairs, along with tables and chairs if you wish to use them.  Several people were there surfing the internet, and I wandered in looking for some coffee.  Initially, I wanted a Mocha.  When I was asking the girl behind the counter about it, she said her expresso machine was broken, but she could substitute coffee for it instead.  I decided that I would rather just get the coffee instead so that's what I got.  She was really nice about it, and apologized for it being out of order.  While waiting for my coffee, the girl offered me a pastry in compensation for her machine being down. Whatever she gave me, it was awesome! It was chocolate chip something, and tasted divine!   I was going to sit in the patio area and relax by the fountain, but I passed because the seats outside were already taken. I ended up hanging out on the couch inside, which was really comfy.    The coffee itself was strong but tasty, and everything went well. I would gladly stop by again when I'm in the area or have time when doing stuff.  Go check it out, the place is pretty cool!",

    "text": "I've been coming to Fair Trade Cafe ever since my move back to Phoenix in 2010 when I was living on Portland.  I met a friend here for coffee, at his suggestion, and have been coming here ever since.  For awhile, I spent three nights a week here either meeting about my book or writing it.  It was such a relaxed atmosphere and the employees were the nicest coffee shop employees in town.    Since moving to Ahwatukee, I have not had much occasion to visit the cafe.  Recently, I have been downtown more frequently.  I've popped in three times in the last week just to read.    They now have the rewards terminal for Belly next to their register, which I've seen popping up at small businesses in town.  They have bigger tables.  They have gotten rid of their retail offerings (apparently they were collecting too much dust).  Their pastry case has been removed.    But other than those basic changes, Fair Trade Cafe is essentially the same.  It is a great local cafe where you can get basic eats (today I had an egg and cheese croissant) and good drinks at a fair price.  And you can feel good doing it, too.  They support fair trade practices.    I've tried a few other local coffee shops in town and they're just not for me.  The vibe here at Fair Trade is relaxed.  I feel comfortable sipping on my soy hot cocoa or Italian soda at my own pace as I read a book.  I don't feel rushed.  I feel only the utmost relaxation.    If you're working on a project, having a quick meeting, writing a paper (or a book) or just want a place to pop in to get away from the hustle and bustle for awhile, Fair Trade Cafe should be your place.  This place reminds me so much of SF Bay Area cafes.  It's just like home!  A side note: One of the owners, Stephanie, is one of the nicest people in Phoenix.  She is such a genuine person and I really wish her every success in growing her business.",

    "text": "Clean environment but very iffy staff and management.  They demanded I buy something to use the restroom so I did.  I bought a cookie, it was hard as a rock, expensive, and when I asked for a water it was poured straight out of a sink.  I think if you won't let a regular person use a restroom as a common human courtesy you don't deserve that persons money.  Every interaction makes a difference, and if you treat someone like they're gonna whip out a heroin rig in the bathroom and take a nap in there too, you're either desperate for money or jaded.  The music sucks too but I'm sure that changes from shift to shift.  They should relocate to Scottsdale where their snobby attitudes will be normal.  Skip this place and go one block east to Desoto Market for a much better experience.  I went back a second time to be sure I didn't just rub them the wrong way, and the coffee was mediocre and way overpriced.  The place was full of transients who were being allowed to use the restrooms without purchase, that's when I said \"screw it I'm writing the review\".  When you gotta go you gotta go, jeez.",

    "text": "I love the ambiance of this cafe! Fair-trade and earth-conscious in the middle of downtown Phoenix. I met with my friend here for a Iced Soy Mocha and a house salad - both were great. The house salad has a lot of dark, leafy greens - which is way better than the iceberg and croutons that you get at other places. And the soy mocha was very yummy and not too sweet. I added some clear syrup that they have on the table to get it to my liking. Overall, a great, solid cafe to try if you're in the area.",

Topped that off with a scope of coffee bean ice cream that had flecks of bean in it and a scoop of Mexican chocolate ice cream which had a nice hint of cinnamon, both were rich and creamy but not over the top with sweetness. They have a nice patio in the back away from the busy light rail stop, but too hot in the summer to sit back there. A great casual hangout with students, older folks reading and a variety of seating options.",

    "text": "I was really excited about this place, having just moved into the neighborhood. Because I work from home, I am always looking for alternative locations to set up and work for a bit. I went in tonight to get caught up on other tasks before the work week. At first I sat near the window but the kitchen was blasting one song with loud bass while the main room was playing another. I moved to the back of the cafe but it was almost worse. I asked the woman at the counter if there was anything she could do because it was making it really difficult to concentrate. She listened to me and walked away. I thought she was going to help solve the issue but... nope. Nothing changed. I guess I won't be returning. I thought the tea and food was good but not good enough to make up for this.",

That all being said, I don't think I'll be back. Can't make an iced latte with actual ice in it at all. Yes I know, espresso should be drank straight and pure but I'm in Phoenix, it's hot, I like iced lattes.  Please please please, stop pouring hot shots over ice and handing me a watered down, lukewarm latte. Please.",

Would you like some ethical business practices with that latte?  Actually it comes with everything you purchase here.  Connectedness to the local community?  Standard.  Quality products?  Ditto.  I spent a good part of the half hour or so I was here talking with one of the employees, Shane.  Great guy and he served up 2 chocolate croissants for my kids with great panache.  I even snapped before and after pics.  And I discovered they make toddy.  Next time you're here ask for your drink made with toddy instead of espresso.  Smoother, more robust and more caffeineyer.",
