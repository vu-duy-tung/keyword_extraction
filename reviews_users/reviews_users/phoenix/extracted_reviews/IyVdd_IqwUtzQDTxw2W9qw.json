OUT OF BAKED POTATOES at a steak house! Nothing about this place justifies the pricing except having the steak house aspect cornered in this Westgate Entertainment area.

For a \"cowboy\" or \"country\" themed restaurant, I was hard pressed to find a decent steak or stiff drink here. The wait staff is more concerned about their own time than yours. Our waitress kept going over to the mechanical bull (yes, this place actually has one) to talk with another waiter who was operating it. Had she actually paid attention to our table, she would've noticed the half empty glasses, as well as the empty plates.   All-in-all: The food was good, but the service was poor. I give it three (3) stars simply because I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. However, places don't seem to realize the importance of good quality service. Waiters would get more tips and people would order more food/drinks. Something for Saddle Ranch to think about.",

I would never recommend anyone too go to this restaurant, stay far away as you can.

    "text": "Well...I tried to just forget about this place and move on, but could not get the horrible experience off my mind as I found my self telling this story over and over.   I own and operate a couple of small quick serve restaurants and am very familiar with the difficulties in making sure the restaurant and staff are prepared to offer good service with every guest contact, I am also able to recognize when the employee service and overall management is so bad that it should be scrapped (or at least retraining is necessary).  First off, this restaurant remains due to it's location and the sheer number of people who descend to the Westgate Center for the various events being held in the area...not for service.  I am sure it is a different place on weekdays without events, as it would be easy for any manager to coordinate staff, food and customer wait times.   On October 22, I was staying at a Westgate Center Hotel to visit my daughter who attends college in the area. I make this trip 6-8 times a year with visits, and baseball spring training.  Being a busy weekend with an event at the Gila River Center, I called the Saddle Ranch to ask about crowds and seating possibilities for the five of us. I was told it would be getting busier but will be able to be seated in about a half hour.  We came down and got in line, when we got to the hostess area we were told the wait would be approximately forty-five minutes...we put in our name and waited. After an hour I went to the hostess area to check on the status and found that we were still several small groups away. Not a big deal, as we continued to talk and wait.  As we were waiting we began to watch empty tables full of dirty dishes sit and not get bussed for anywhere from twenty to thirty five minutes.  At one point we counted thirteen tables not being prepared for customers or being cleaned.  I again walked to the hostess area and waited behind a lady who was also complaining about the wait, who arrived thirty to forty minutes after us...yet she was seated at this point because she was complaining loud enough?? Anyway, now frustrated, I asked why we were still awaiting a table tafter almost two hours and why someone after us got seated first, the hostess informed me that although there were empty tables, they had no clean dish ware to serve us. I mentioned that if they cleared the several tables that were empty for over thirty minutes they would have dishes, to which she replied that her manager told the staff to stop clearing the tables and just work on getting the food out to those that were sitting.  Funny thing is, that we had been watching this manager walk back and forth between the kitchen and the hostess table never lifting a finger to help any of the restaurant staff.  So unprofessional and uncaring...  Well...we left and went to the Yard House, who had been just as busy but managed and staffed well, and made there best of a frustrating and almost ruined night.  I am sure they provide a decent service at times, but under pressure is where you see the True characteristics of a team and a manager...and this was a complete disaster.",

We ordered the Nachos appetizer with added chicken; bland and sadly, it was the best part of our meal.  My wife ordered the burger with garlic mashed potatoes. The burger was overly greasy and the mashed potatoes tasted like they were cooked with garlic flavorings; very unimpressive.  I had the Two Steak Tacos. How can tacos be bland? Added salt to bring some flavor out. The steak pieces were a bit chewy. In lieu of rice I had fries. Again, no salt on the fries.  The piece de resistance. I asked for water with my meal. It tasted like it was drawn from a hose in someone's backyard. While not the best, it was still drinkable. However, the refill was absolutely gross. They have pitchers lying around to refill waters and maybe iced teas. I saw our server use one to fill my water. I took a swig, at first taste I thought he gave me soda water it was so bitter. A second swig confirmed to me that it wasn't soda water and that it just tasted plain awful. It makes you wonder how does water go bad. Then you see the little birds flying in and out of the place and it makes you wonder if it had some bird flavorings added, if you get my drift. I am surprised the health dept doesn't have a say about that.  All in all, if you are on a low salt diet, anything on the menu is ok to eat because they don't appear to put salt on anything.  Will I be back? No. For price you pay, you get cheap thin chintzy napkins, crappy water, and bland food. Save your money and hit any of the other locations, there are plenty to choose from.",

After waiting around for both the server and manager to find me a gluten free menu, I just went ahead and ordered from the regular menu.   I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich with no bun and asked for it to be lettuce wrapped.   When my food arrives, I had a tray of sweet potato fries and a piece of burnt chicken breast with melted cheese. No lettuce, tomato or onions.   I complained to the food runner and he came back with a small amount of the above vegetables mentioned. When my server came by he told me he would be right back and came out with large pieces of lettuce, sliced tomato and onions and a pickle wedge and apologized. He also told me not to use the side of bbq sauce the kitchen had put on the plate as that had gluten in it.   I was thankful for the service of my server but I am extremely disappointed that any restaurant kitchen would send out food in this way to a customer.",

    "text": "Let's start off with Saturday morning...  My boyfriend and I are from out of town and looked up breakfast places around us, we decided to try out saddle ranch.  We got there around 9 or so and the place looked deserted. (Website said opened at 9)  So I waited until 9:10 or so to call and see what was going on.  The lady in the phone was super sweet and said she'd be down soon to let us in.  She came down 5 mins later to let us know the hour for opening changed to 10. Thanked us and left.   So we said screw it and ate somewhere else.   We came back Saturday night around 10ish pm to have a quick bite to eat and drink.  The place was like a straight party zone. Music was so loud you have to yell to hear anything.   We walked in and waited for someone to come up to us for seating (sign said wait for host for seating) and this guy came up to check out ID. Didn't say anything and walked back to the table where you can buy shirts and stuff... so we finally when up to one of the waitresses and got a table.   We were able to order pretty quickly and food didn't take to long... but the food is not worth it. We got the club wrap and jalapeno Mac and cheese. The wrap was dry and horrible.... I could barely finish half of it. The Mac and cheese was alright.  We didn't see our waitress much after that.. which I understand since it was so busy.... but jesus the foods expensive.    By the way nothing about this place was country, besides the decorations and the bull you can ride. It's a straight pop club at night .. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!   I will not be returning that's for sure",

As a matter of fact, the first time we ate there our waiter was training a waitress; they were both so attentive and friendly, that they were the reason we returned a second time.  We have received the same level of service each time we returned, and we have never had reason to complain about the food.  Today was exceptional, as we approached the door, a waitress came out to us literally with open arms and gave me a hug.  It turns out this was Johnnie, she had been our favorite waitress at the Texas Road House.  This being Mother's Day, the restaurant was busy as expected.  I asked Johnnie to seat us in her section. The hostess told us it would be a thirty minute wait, and we were okay with that.  We were seated within ten minutes!  Johnnie gave us the same super service we had come to expect of her at the Texas Road House. The steaks and ribs we ordered were cooked to perfection, and the sides were as tasty as one can expect.  Knowing that Johnnie is working at Saddle Ranch, we'll return more frequently and we'll be sure to ask for Johnnie.",

The outdoor patio was shaded and comfortable and overlooked the water fountain in the plaza. I was slightly disappointed that the breakfast/egg menu didn't go past 11 am on a Sunday, but our lunch food was all really good. Alcoholic beverages were huge and delicious and the bread basked before lunch, go carefully because you can really get filled up. We don't live nearby so this was a special drive for us to try it and we are all super excited to go back soon.",

My husband and I were out for a rare Friday night out without the kids and decided to stop and check out the menu He has some pretty restrictive dietary issues so we wanted to see if there was anything he could eat.  We were greeted at the door by a very friendly woman who introduced herself as the manager. She was very helpful when I asked about the menu items and things my husband could eat. She personally seated us in a comfortable corner. The waitress came pretty quickly and was also very nice and helpful.  Much to our surprise, we were looking at the menu when the manager showed up at our table with a complimentary appetizer that was friendly to my husband's dietary restrictions. I thought that was the most amazing thing and went a very long way towards customer service. It was completely unexpected and very very much appreciated.  We placed our order in a reasonable amount of time and food showed up pretty quickly. It was entertaining watching a few people try to stay on the mechanical bull that was across from our table. The food tasted fine, not great, but I have had worse and it was cooked as we had requested.  I had ordered a mai tai the small size and someone brought the large size to our table, but they only charged us for the small one since that is what I had ordered. Again, great customer service.  Overall we had a fantastic experience. The service was exemplary and we would definitely consider going back again. I don't know if this is a new manager but she certainly did an amazing job. Kudos!!",

    "text": "I was looking for a place for dinner before going to before the movie.  There a quite a few restaurants at Westgate, so we looked around and chose this Saddle Ranch.    Wrong choice!  The hostess was friendly, and we were seated right away.  The waitress had a great personality, but service was average at best.   This place is a little on the pricy side.  The food didn't justify the cost.  I had a baseball cut sirloin, which came with a vegetable medley and one side.  I chose the loaded baked potato. The vegetables were the best part but were just OK.  The steak was supposed to come with choice of a sauce, glaze or butter, but is was left off.  It was no better or bigger than a Chili's or Applebee's steak, but was twice the price.  The flavor and tenderness of the meat was just average, but was cooked to the the way I ordered it.   The baked potato was large, but had been sitting in a warming drawer for a while and had that off-putting old baked potato taste.  I ordered it with the loaded potato part on the side.  I thought a loaded potato had butter, sour cream, bacon bits, chives, and sometimes grated cheese.  I got a small plastic container with about one tablespoon of sour cream, and barely a teaspoon of butter.  I ate some of it because I was hungry, but left over half.  Later, when the waitress asked about the meal, I told her about the old potato.  She told the manager.  He came later asked about the meal and offered to replace the potato, or substitute another side, but I was done eating.  He said he would comp a desert.  The waitress said that we were getting the Vanilla Brioche Bread Pudding.  We waited for at least another twenty minutes, but when she finally brought it, she brought an ice cream sundae, saying the were out of the bread pudding...the final letdown.  This is a very attractive looking restaurant, but I don't understand why the kitchen would send out a substandard meal unless they just don't care  Maybe that is the norm for this here.  For a place that bills itself as a chop house, it leaves a lot to be desired.",

    "text": "I don't understand why anyone in their right mind would come here and expect a good steak or rack of ribs.  The Saddle Ranch is an apps and drinks spot to start or end your night.  Get drunk enough and you might find the balls to want to ride the mechanical bull.  I'll admit that the service was crappy but they made up for it by giving my table complimentary dessert, which isn't too bad if you've been drinking since 4 PM.  I had the appetizer sampler platter and the mac and cheese.  App Samp Platter: The highlights here are the sweet potato fries and the sliders. It is a good thing to order if you have no ribs standards as they give you 1/4th a rack, if you think they're good well then go ahead.  Mac and Cheese: Really weak. Nothing special, they're making mark up profit off this and they ain't afraid to show it, it's sucky and they know it.  The drink options are basic.   I would not be going to the Saddle Ranch on Sunset but in Glendale there's a 25% chance you'll end up here. IF you do, stick to apps, you won't feel so  gipped afterwards.",

(One of my pet peeves is an empty drink and at their prices this should never be an issue) Drinks were ordered but went empty on the long wait for the food. 25 minutes is a long time for a $13 burger and a $19 steak sandwich. Steak was really small, grissily and tough. Huge plate with 80% fries made it look like a slider, not a sandwich. Burger was better but pretty much the same. 3 tall draft beers, a steak sandwich and a burger and tip $86. We're done... sound of microphone dropping  PS Padre Murphy's Blackened Prime Rib sandwich for $15 is the BOMB, just sayin",

I came with my wife and children 2 hours in advance to grab some dinner before the Coyotes game tonight. We ordered 3 burgers with fries, French dip, and a Spinach Artichoke dip bread bowl as an app. This place was not even remotely busy, but all 3 hamburgers, the French dip, fries, and the spinach artichoke dip bread bowl were all cold. Very cold! While ordering the food I asked the waiter if I could get mashed potatoes instead of the fries (they are the exact same price on the side menu btw) and he replied \"oh they don't allow us to do that, our kitchen gets waaaaay too confused and it's hard enough to keep these orders straight, dumb huh, they're pretty bad back there\" . Yes sir, that is really stupid that I can't swap one type of potato for the other, especially when I'm paying $17 for a dried out hockey puck on my plate that was really cold. So in summation if you like not getting your food the way you want, cold to the touch, dried out meat, and a waiter that is clueless to knowing that we shouldn't need to come find him for refills and talking to the customers like we're frat house buddies making fun our crappy employment choices and paying over $100 for that. This is the place for you!!",

We were seated behind the bar.    We sat and ordered:  chicken strips with a side of french fries & french dip.  The chicken strips were plenty and they were good.  A light coat of crispy and chicken.  The french dip was GOOD, tasty beef slices, and au jus was perfect (normally I think most places makes it salty).    Our server was awesome, she checked on us many times and made sure our drinks were filled.  At the end of the meal, she brings the check and a cotton candy (HUGE and on the house from the owners).  It was very nice.  My teenager inhaled it.  LOL!",

After 45 minutes we inquired and were told that they had stopped seating anyone to allow the kitchen to catch up and would be getting to us soon. They seated us about ten minutes after that. While we were waiting to be seated we went to the bar to have a drink. We ordered two diet Pepsi's that were were dreadful tasting. I asked the bar tender what was wrong with them and he told me the soda machine wasn't working properly. And that they were trying to fix it! Why the heck serve a bad drink knowing it is bad! I gave it back and just asked for water instead. After we were seated we ordered two Ribeye's ($30 a plate for a 12 oz!) with baked potatoes. Then 45 minutes later a cold liver looking piece of meat arrived with the frozen veggies and under-baked potatoes. Oh but it gets better when the waitress came back 15 minutes later and we showed her our food and told her it's actually cold to the touch she rolled her eyes!! She offered to microwave the food for us or we would have to wait for it be recooked. After her nasty eye roll and dramatic sigh my wife was over it. Done.  We spoke to the manager and left without eating. We will never be back.",

About 10 minutes later, the assistant manager came over with 2 beers, and said they were on the house. You guessed it, the same 2 beers we ordered, even hotter now. Terrible service.",

On our last visit, there was a Coyotes game going on; perhaps prices rise based on the Events in the area? There are other restaurants, very close to this place, that offer the same quality service & food for a lot less.",

Our server was great and there were numerous other staff that topped our drinks off and checked on us. The food on the other hand was atrocious. 2 of us ordered French dips that were so incredibly salty we couldn't even use the au jus. Which it desperately needed considering the meat was as dry as sliced cardboard. One of the people in our party ordered a ham and cheese omelette. Should be difficult to screw that up right?...he was brought one that had bacon,tomatoes, and onions. The ONLY food that was good was the complimentary cornbread and biscuits with cinnamon butter. There are a lot of restaurants in Westgate. Do yourself a favor and pass this one by.",

When food service delivered she definitely gave attitude when I explained what was wrong.  Even though I explained what was wrong she still insisted to provide replacement which I rejected.  Guess what, she still had someone deliver anyway.  She never once apologized?  She did end up giving credit for multiple items but that was not my priority when explaining to her her screw ups.  Ownership at this restaurant ought to look for a different person to fill this evening shift manager position.  Additionally, drinks sub par, food was not very good, only redeeming aspect is that we had a good primary waitress!  I would avoid this establishment as there are other much better restaurants in this complex.  Sorry for the comments but you need to be trained on proper customer service.",

Took our drink order, then things sloowwwed way down, took awhile to get a glass of wine and one beer,by the way,ordered house Cab...large size... drinks finally came, was surprised how small it was,and said so to husband.   Kept seeing other servers bustling around quite a bit,but no Haley,she finally showed up and took our order.  Seemed to take too long for two Cajun burgers and fries, which by the way,we're tasty,but food was just barely warm.  Have no idea how long it sat in window to be delivered.  Needed to ask for ketchup which food runner supplied.  Needed napkins , where is Haley?  Spotted her way up front hanging around, flagged her down, (better order drinks now also! )  Again,loooonnng wait, saw her come from kitchen area,with napkins, then to bar, had our drinks in hand,then out to  outside area!!!!   Several minutes later she serves them.  I questioned her about the first wine size, \"Yes,it's the same\" ...Definitely not!   During  meal, no one ever came by to ask us if everything was ok!!!! Finally after at least 20 minutes after being done with our meal,we went up to front desk!   Asked us,how can we help you, \"We'd like to our pay bill\",  Oh,who was you're server?\"  Haley, \"Oh,just a minute\" ! She shows back up after a bit, doesn't say a word to us...trailing, behind her a gentleman approaches us,not identifying himself,starts processing our bill,(I told him the obvious difference between first and second glass),which I could tell he was making adjustments, (good thing  $14.95 for house ,large glass!)  I know he knew we weren't happy,one comment he made...\"sorry,she just got hit with table of 35, really!?!  Not the other hour , she was supposed go be our server!  I knew by then he definitely was some kind of manager,and saw he was writing something down on a business card!  Then he handed  it to us, then identifies himself...\"Sorry, but next time you come, ask for me and you can have a free appetizer\".  Really, next time,don't think so.  I know you shouldn't judge one not so great experience,but there is a lot more choices out there!  Bought 3 other gift cards for our children, $50 a piece, hope they have a better experience,and enough money!!!!  Our bill,like I said,2 Cajun burgers,w/fries,2 beers,2 wines, $79,kinda of pricey I feel for lunch!   Haley, did get a tip, not as generous as we would normally  do...not the runner,or table busers fault.",

The WARM BEER was taken back and removed from my tab, no problem. So, I then ordered a $4.50 bottle ASSUMING that it would have been on ice or for sure from a different chiller but THAT TOO WAS WARM BEER. The bottle came to the table along with a barely chilled glass which could not get the beer cold at all. Didn't bother with that one...just drank my WARM BEER with my quick bit to eat.  Service was good, food was good, no wait time or seating issues. the only issue I had was \"WARM BEER\"  And because of the \"WARM BEER\"..... I doubt I will ever return.",

When you come out of the arena there's a bunch of girls rolling around with a bucket giving away free bull ride passes to sucker you in. We walked in and the place was about 50/50 empty/full. So of course we tried to sit where the bull was because we were dumb enough to pick up 2 bull riding \"free\" tickets. Guess what, you can't sit there because those spots are reserved even though nobody has it reserved for the night. Ok, well let's just grab a normal table then. Nope, we have to put our name on the list and wait for one of the empty tables to come up. We sit down and wait for about 15 minutes looking at empty tables and we come to the realization that this place sucks so we get up and we walk out. Guess what, we never got buzzed for a seat. We did get informed that we are on the waiting list but that's it. Way to go restaurant! Guess I should've read all the poor reviews before I bothered wasting my time.",

    "text": "*I read the review that \"were not recommended\" by yelp on this place, after I posted my review\". Most of them are pretty dead-on as far as I'm concerned.  I need to get better about checking reviews BEFORE I go.*  Good for cheap happy hour beers, but that's probably about it. I didn't drink because I just came with my son to grab a bite. Will not be back for food.  My son (age 12) and I went to Shout House, but found it wasn't open on Tuesdays. So we walked around a bit and decided to give Saddle Ranch a try. The place was pretty empty, besides the bar. We got seated right next to the bar area. This worked out ok today, but I could see how it could be a bad idea with a rowdier crowd at the bar.   The server suggested the Monster appetizer because it was happy hour and 1/2 off. Comes with 4 wings, onion rings, 4 short ribs, 3 sliders, and sweet potato fries ($23.99 reg price, happy hour $12). My son liked the wings, I thought they were very salty. The onion rings were good, slider patties were burnt and incredibly dry, short ribs sauce was good but they seemed like they had been sitting....maybe overnight-dry and tasted rewarmed. Sweet potato fries were cold and just not good. Server did bring us another order of sliders, cooked better, but still flavorless. She did bring us a \"half baked choc chip cookie\" topped with ice cream as a \"special thanks for coming in today\"...not sure if that is just something they do or if it was because it was our first time there and weren't real pleased with our food.   Management must have been bored because he asked how we were doing 4-5 times during our 30/40 minute visit. The last time he came over, he stunk horribly of cigarette smoke (seriously like he had a lit one on him), not a great smell while you're trying to have a meal. On his 3rd visit to the table (after we had gotten our food) I did tell him about the sliders being very overcooked/dry and he said, \"Yeah, that happens with the mini's sometimes\" and walked away.  He got just past our table, turned around and THEN said, \"can I have them put another order in for you?\". I just felt he was very unprofessional.   I'll end by saying that the 1 star is because we had a pretty good server, not great, but decent. I don't think with as slow as it was that refilling a water glass should have been too much to handle.  She stood there and watched me pour some of my son's water into my glass and still didn't bother to come back with more water.",

Tables didn't have silverware and we only had one server who was great and did the best being just her.  They should've assigned 2 servers.  We left kabukis to go to saddleranch to celebrate a 21st bday. The food took long and didn't have the right food. Someone in our party order salad and it tasted like dirt and there was a plastic piece in the salad.   We really will never go back.  The good - they gave is round of shots because it was bday and some dessert. That was really nice but it's hard to feel to good just cause service sucked.  Our waitress was amazing and it sucked because management didn't recognize she needed help.  The other thing is she's the face of the restaurant and any bad service is reflected on her which I don't agree.",

However, after 10 minutes of everyone just walking past us and never coming take any orders or say they would be by, we flagged someone down and she took care of us immediatly and was a great server. I would have overlooked it had the food been good but the food wasn't anything memorable. We had nachos which didn't have hardly anything on them. The jalapeno mac and cheese was decent but room temperature. The beers were really over priced, I guess because of the game, I don't think a restaurant should change their prices on game nights. The atmosphere is fun but I wouldn't be back on purpose with so many choices around the area.",

    "text": "Ok... what was good? The free cotton candy dessert. Is it free for everyone? No, it was a 'sorry we suck' comp dessert. INFO TO KNOW... If you are going on a night where there are events going on - they want your credit or debit card before you even order!! So what if you are a cash person and don't carry cards? Don't know and neither did our server. :/ Food was cold and overpriced. We waited for quite some time for our silverware though so maybe our food was warm at some point. (shrugs) Our $3 drinks came in the small clear plastic water cups. Why? Because they were doing dishes. Did they bring us normal people glasses at any point? No. Nor did we get refills until we flagged our server down not once but twice. When you bring people food that includes french fries, you normally have ketchup to go along with it. Hmm... waited quite some time for the ketchup too.  In their defense, it was kinda busy BUT your restaurant is in Westgate which always seems to be busy. You should have your service ON POINT by now. It wasn't 7pm it was 4 in the afternoon. The table next to us also waited for silverware and had to rush to eat and pay their bill to make it to the stadium by 6 like we did. Oh and City of Glendale tax sucks, it's like buying an additional meal. Now I remember why we quit going to Westgate.  Again, what was good?? ... the cotton candy. Yay for cotton candy and the sugar rush it gave me to forget that I was pissed that I had overpriced lukewarm food!!",

Since my girlfriend just turned 21 she asked what a good drink would be, the waitress (also training someone at the time!) was quick to ask questions about what she liked flavor wise and had suggestions right away. We took the suggestion and my girlfriend absolutely loved the drink!   They were leaving us alone, but still walking by just to make sure we didn't need more and what not, and they were great! After we got our bill the waitress walked over one more time with free shots on the house to celebrate her b-day! Of all places they were the first to offer a free drink!   Food was great, and everything is half price during happy hour! Even drinks! Everything was mixed well, and the place is really fun when it gets packed! It's huge and really open, so even with a lot of people inside it never feels stuffy or uncomfortable at all. They have one really large main bar, then a smaller one off to the side as well.   The manager even went out of her way to come say hi to us which was really great!   We are for sure going to try and become regulars at this place!",

That took 10 minutes for the soda and 25 more minutes for the shrimp cocktails.  The waitress was very pleasant and informed us that the kitchen was backed up. So we ordered another appetizer thinking that we could still make the game on time. Our thinking was correct but our selection was wrong. The food was cold and very uneventful.  The shrimp cocktails were over cooked. To make matters worse the 3 appetizers and 1 soda came to $86 with tip. I'll pass on this place.",

The second time we went IT WAS AWESOME we told them how the first experiance was and they apologized for that and gave us a free dissert. not the usual cotton candy, but a baked cookie (which was not cooked.. how ironic) we said thanks and let them know the rest of the meal was fantastic!  This is one of those places it would be perfect for a sandwich and BEERS. the ambiance is great. the service is awesome, but go here for the drinks.. and the bull riding!",

They do a pretty good job with atmosphere, cycling people in with a decent reservation service, and most of the morning games on. Bartenders are attentive, the servers are normally adequate, and the area is spacious.  My only issues are with the price, and the strange food selection - breakfast ends before it even really makes sense to get to the stadium, like 10:30. Some extra time to grub on some eggs and bacon would be nice, but then they switch to their lunch/dinner menu, which I believe is limited for game day (I could be wrong on that). The portions are ridiculously huge, which wouldn't be a problem in most cases, but I don't really want to feel like it's time for a nap by the time the game started. And with the portion size, comes a pretty high price for each item.   Really, it just comes down to menu diversity and how busy this place can get in the mornings on Sunday. If you're not there early, it's going to be a while to get in and get out.",

Aside from a slightly longer than expected wait time for the food (likely due to the group), our appetizers and then food arrived shortly thereafter The quality of food is well above average and portions are generous, dare I say excessive. Definite notables and must tries include their filet mignon (just don't order it well done, it'll come off as a bit dry) and their guacamole. Coming from a hispanic background, i'm particularly annoyed by the green paste that some restaurants put out. I was pleasantly  surprised that the guacamole put out by this place was as good as it was.   All in all the experience and food was good. Just an FYI however, they will not split checks for larger groups.",

Waited almost an hour for our food to arrive, it was warm not hot, nothing special, and people who came in after us got their food first.  Finally a young lady came over said she was the manager on duty, appoligise for the negative experence.  Gave us her card, ssaid something about asking for her, and said to please try Saddle Ranch Chop House again.  Saddle Ranch is not a cheap greasy spoon, but honestly we have had better service & food at the Waffel House on the interstate than this place.  Will not return as I see no reason to hope aything changes in the future.  Now after the fact I look at Saddle Ranch's YELP Reviews, and should have seen all the bad reviews, and avoided the place.

The mashed potatoes were lukewarm, and the sauteed spinach might might generously be called wilted, but really it could still be served on a spinach salad. So all in all, the meal was awful. We'd have been better off getting a steak at the Waffle House. Oh, and the wine list is incredibly mediocre and overpriced worse than any restaurant I've ever seen...$16.99 for an 8 oz pour of low quality bottom shelf wine that can be bought for under $10/bottle at your neighborhood convenience store. Awful all around.",

    "text": "The highlight of this place is literally the mechanical bull right next to the entrance. It's only $3 to get a ride on the bull. The guy who was operating the bull was very nice & friendly - he was enthusiastic about explaining the instructions. If you have never ridden a mechanical bull before, they will go a little easier on you - slow & steady. However, they can easily turn it up a notch with the bull making sharp turns and quickly thrusting forwards/backwards to knock you out. Overall, a very entertaining night watching other people give it a try.   I would have given this place 3 stars for a nice location at Westgate and the good ambiance. The server promptly took our orders and delivered our drinks. We later asked our server at the counter to give us the bill. We waited and waited for almost 30 minutes - still no bill. She was doing a million other things, and I don't know if she forgot or thought we were unimportant. When we had to remind her a second time, it only took her 1 minute to get the bill to us. She failed to give us our bill in a timely manner, and wasted 30 minutes of my life. 2 stars for bad service.",

On a slow Wednesday night I had to wait forever at the front (which was unmanned) without ever being acknowledged. Finally after 10 minutes I waived a waiter down who grabbed a menu and sat me, by myself, at a six-top that was crammed between two different parties of over a dozen people each. It ended up being SO LOUD I could barely think. I planned to ask for a different seat when a server came to get my drink, but *15* minutes later I still had not talked to anyone or even been given a water. I finally stood up and left and was never spoken to on the way out. Almost a half-hour of my time wasted. I drove to the other side of the plaza where I received great food and great service at Gordon Biersch.",

After 15 to 20 mins of not seeing anyone, I told the manager I guess we need to sit inside in order to get service. After several more minutes we got our appetizer, a chip and Spinach dip thing in a bread bowl (12.99) so if you actually wanted much dip,  your out of luck because there is little room in this bread ball but that was ok because the dip was terrible and never got hot enough to melt the cheese... so after my wife choked that down our meals arrived again after several minutes.  My meal was a very 1 dimensional boring bland pasta (18.99).  After 2 bites I was done.  They came to get it and asked if I liked it and I said not really and that we are ready to leave. After another amount of time we were brought an \"on the house dessert\" it just sat there until again my wife tried it and confirmed that it also taste like hell.. I was informed that they needed to be sure that the on the house dessert wasn't on my bill and that I appreciate because we didn't order it!  Will not be going back.  80 bucks for 2. Pass..",

She also got the manager involved and he gave us an extra plate of wings plus a hamburger. The other thing was I ordered extra onion rings and only got 6- 7 so for these prices I was expecting a good portion. But all n all the service was really good and the manager did the right thing.

All to often, corporate high ups don't get involved when the little things. It took us some time to get connected, mainly due to my work schedule (I work nights, graveyards). Since she did her best to reach out, I felt it was deserving of another try. I was offered first round of drinks and 2 appetizers for four. I decided to try them again at Bike Night on last Thursday.  It was supposed to be 4 of us. They planned on 4 of us showing up....I brought 11!!!  No problems or issues with that. They \"made\" space for all of us outside so we could enjoy all the motorcycles coming and going. Then, they honored the first round....for all of us! Ken, the GM came out to check on us several times and suggested we try the BBQ chicken nachos and the Monster Platter. I orered 2 platters and the nachos...it filled us all up! The platter was enormous! It even had BBQ ribs on it! Try it....It won't disappoint!  We ended up hanging out at Saddle Ranch the entire night, after bike night ended (around 9pm).   All in all, we had a great time. I'm told, they have a new staff since my previous reviews. Looks like they are doing everything right to make thus pave the go-to event-restaurant at Westgate!",

Stare at the table from across the room, notice everyone staring back at you. Don't come back to the table for another 20 minutes 4. Charge 18% gratuity automatically based on party size. Most restaurants have stopped doing this, take notes.  It is obvious our server didn't give a fuck about his job. The manager (or some dude that looked like a manager telling people what to do) was there that night and he didn't notice even when we complained as he walked by.  I hope you close down and something much, much, much better comes. Like McDonalds. Even McDonalds is better than you. Think about that.  p.s.

We ordered  an appetizer the Monster I believe it's called and it looked like a monster.  Awful to say at best.   For our meal I had a burger that was dry and tasteless and a few others ordered the BBQ Chicken Sandwich which they said was dry and no good.  My son ordered the Chicken tenders and he ate one.  How this place is still in business is a shock.  We will never be back.",

The jalapeno bread was pretty good and so were thee nachos. But, I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the steak sandwich. Both were dry, without flavor and disappointing. Most likely I will never come back.   Thanks to Derek for being such a great waiter!",

    "text": "Pre Game for Coyotes Game. Quoted 40 minutes, but it ended up being more like 30 minutes for a party of 5. We waited at the sidebar near the mechanical bull. Service was good there, and when the party seated at the bar stools got up the bartender said we could sit there and eat. Should have taken the offer, but waited for the table. We were seated,(4:40pm) and Misty came over to serve us. Some had drinks already, and a few needed refills. We also cut to the chase and ordered a Monster Platter, with a bit of everything. So that round of drinks took 15 minutes, and appetizer came promptly. Then entrees ordered,(5:05pm) and another round of drinks. By this time we see Misty running around, and not even able to wave her down. 30 minutes later round of drinks delivered, and was told they had to change the keg. Game time is 6pm  will we make it?   Entrees delivered by a food runner one at a time (5:45pm) Really? Having a restaurant background I am pretty easy going when it comes to seeing a busy venue, but this was really bad!  All entrees delivered except mine...a rib eye. My wife had to get up from the table to get salt and pepper, plus some steak sauce. We then stopped another server to ask about the missing meal. While everyone at my table is hustling to get the meals eaten in 10 minutes, 5:55pm my rib eye arrives, I turned it away because we needed to get to the game. I asked for the check, and Misty came over saying it was her fault, and she was sooo sorry. She never has a bad day, but her Son was arrested the night before, and blah, blah, blah and she is off her game. Did I want to take the steak to go? I am going to a hockey game. Really?  So they discounted the steak, no visit from Manager, who was clearly visible throughout the evening, but didn't seem to be helping staff much. Overall a terrible night, and game had started by the time we got in our seats.",

    "text": "I was visiting out of San Diego and my friend wanted to take me on a semi touristy adventure, we ended up at Westgate. It was about brunch time and we were hunnngry , while all the restaurants around there  looked very inviting, Saddle Ranch Chop House stood out to me. It reminded me of an old Western movie looking type of place. We walked in and we were seated right away, this place is huge, and very cool looking inside they even have a mechanical bull that we didnt ride but its there lol. The waitress came and took our order she was  very familiar with the menu which is a great thing, we placed our order, she informed us that the portions were fairly large so we decided we were gonna share. In the meantime, they brought ous a mini loaf or wheat bread and butter and jalapeno cornbread and bitter it was sooo delicious and fresh. (still hot) I was looking forward to what the food was gonna taste like. We ordered the build your own Omlette (you can choose up to three ingredients) if you want more theres a charge with a side of hasbrowns , and cinnamon swirl french toast. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and the waitress was right these are sharing portions of food. everything was tastey basic breakfast though. the atmosphere is awesome like if thats how it would be in Texas. The only complaint i have was that the waitress didnt really have a friendly personality so she seemed like she didnt want to be there and also she didnt come check on our table for refills too often we had to tell someone who was passing by if they could get us refills. and I had the get condiments from the table next to ours cause she was taking forever to come back to our table. but id come back for dinner just to see if it gets better and to try some steak.",

    "text": "Half baked cookie? Try raw and my fries,....microwaved.   I use to love this place but my last few visits have been less than pleasant. That's probably being nice.   They are quite pricy but it use to be worth it as the food was that good but this last year something has dropped. My first issue with this restaurant came on a game night, now I have been here many times before but never on a game night. A few of us decided to go out and I recommended Saddle Ranch. It was happy hour but due to game night they did not honor those prices, I was unaware of that but we stayed. My drink was massively watered down. Normally their drinks are quite strong but that night barley tasted any alcohol in my drink. My friend got nachos and was asked if he wanted to upgrade it with steak and avocado, he said yes. Needless to say ended up being $30 worth of nachos with a handful of steak bits and maybe a tablespoon of avocado, very disappointing. I felt bad for recommending it and blamed it on being a game night.  Brings me to tonight all I wanted was a side of fries and a half a cookie which is my favorite. I called in the order and went to pick it up so I don't have to wait there. I got home started to eat the fries,....they were mushy and crispy on the ends like they had been sitting there all day and were put in the microwave. When I moved on to the cookie it wasn't half-baked it was raw. A pile of cookie dough in a box. When I called the restaurant to complain and asked for a manager I could not get a hold of anyone. Two phone calls later finally got someone on the line, I asked for a manager and was transferred to the Event Coordinator. Called for the fourth time finally got a hold of the manager and let him know what was going on, he offered to make me a new one if I came back which I did not want to do since I was already home. $18 for fries and a cookie and both were awful. He took my name and number and said he would have the corporate office call me back so we will see how that goes. In conclusion this restaurant has gone downhill and every time I go food gets worse. I should have gone to Walmart and got cookie dough and a bag of fries and it would have been better than what I got.",

    "text": "Was here on a TUESDAY evening with a group of 16 people from work who arrived staggered times between 5 and 7:30 pm.  The place was half empty at BEST.  We arrived around 7pm and most people had already been served food and drink at our table. The table was crowded with dirty plates and glasses.  25 minutes went by before we even saw the waitress serving our table and then had to flag her down.  We ordered an iced tea and a margarita.  The iced tea arrived in about 10 minutes.  30 minutes later the margarita came.  We both ordered hamburgers.  Over ONE HOUR later they arrived.  The meat on the burgers didn't taste like beef, it seemed full of fillers or breadcrumbs maybe.  I only ate a few bites of mine.  The sweet potato fries were good.  Waitress never came back to ask if everything was okay.  People in our group gave up and started going to the bar the get their drinks. The cotton candy desert was fun that someone at our table ordered, and was good, but how can you screw up cotton candy.  Everybody was constantly trying to flag down the waitress to get their bills or a drink.  One person was ready to leave but couldn't get her bill to pay for a good 40 minutes.  The waitress would bring one person a drink and literally run away from our table.  A couple of people rode the mechanical bull - fun to watch but not enough to make me ever come back here.   Don't know if they were short staffed or what the problem was but a good waitress would have told us instead of just trying to avoid doing her job.  Shaking my head....... ******UPDATE******After reading my review, a member from their corporate office asked for my phone number and did call me.  She was very apologetic, wanted to know the waitress' name, and a few other details.  She gave me her name and cell phone number and asked me to call her the next time we planned to go there and that she would buy us a round of drinks and appetizers and would make sure that we had an amazing time.  I'm glad that they care.",

    "text": "Very disappointing and they just didn't seem to care. I researched a central place for a group coming from around the Valley to meet for a late brunch. I was excited to see that this place served brunch until 3pm with $2 drink specials. Once seated I went back up to the hostess to ask for a brunch menu and was told there was no brunch or drink specials today because of an event. The lunch menu was a bit disappointing with few options that seemed overpriced. We were sat at a table that hung out into the main walkway so a few of our party kept getting bumped by staff and customers. They serve everything in GIANT bowls and platters that just make it difficult to fit everything on your table. The BBQ chicken chopped salad was a huge disappointment- I asked for no tomatoes which meant I didn't get any other toppings either. The explanation given was that the toppings are premixed with the tomatoes. This may have affected my ordering decision and a good server would have mentioned this up front. I can make chicken and lettuce at home. My chicken salad was also lacking much chicken. Before the food even arrived the manager came by the table and asked how things were going. I attempted to let him know I felt like there was a \"bait and switch\" with the brunch menu and information presented online. He immediately shut us down and said it was because if an event at the stadium. I pointed out there is no mention of this policy on the website and the event wasn't for another 2 hours. The other frustration was the server just couldn't keep our drinks filled- this Phoenix people! I spent my college days waiting tables and my husband has been in the food service industry for 16 years, we try to be understanding and realize sometimes things happen, but this was such a collection of awfulness I just had to let people know.",

Didn't eat anything and if you are looking for microbrews you won't find many but there's a ton of space here and the bathroom lines weren't bad considering it was totally packed all day and night!",

    "text": "My parents went to this location for an early dinner recently and had terrible service particularly from the waitress. The waitress wasn't filling up their waters, would give attitude and roll her eyes, and would even take the longer way to get to the kitchen just so she could avoid my parents' table. My parents had to get up multiple times to go to the waitress themselves or grab another waiter to take care of them. Also, my mother ordered ribs and got them very dry and not appetizing even physically to look at. She sent them back to the kitchen and received new ribs but they ended up being dry again. My dad noticed a sign from the day before saying that they had an All You Can Eat special for ribs the day before, so they talked to the manager and my parents were told that Saddle Ranch admitted to reusing some of the ribs from the day before and that's why they were so dry. My parents were very unhappy with their experience. The only reason we didn't give them 1 star was because my mom finally ended up ordering their burger sliders instead and those were very good.",

    "text": "Whatever you do, DON'T start a tab here!! My husband and I started a tab and had a few drinks. They charged our card and I signed a receipt that friday night. On Monday they charged my card again. This charge was for $67, the original charge was $76. We called Saddle Ranch to find out why, and were told they'd look into it and give us a call right back. 6 hours later, with no returned call, we called them again. The lady on the phone said they didn't charge our card again, and to take it up with my bank. She hadn't even looked into it. After making the (hopefully accidental) mistake of charging a customer's credit card twice, an establishment could at least have the decency to look into it. We've been here several times and received mediocre service. The drinks are overpriced and the bartenders don't know how to make more than a couple different drinks (although they will tell you they will look up the recipe, they then just ignore you until you flag them down and ask for just a beer). We were able to get our money back by disputing the charge with our bank, but after this experience I would never trust them with a credit card again. It's unlikely that we'll ever go back there again.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed with the service here.  Made a reservation online for Mother's Day Brunch for 10:45 am.  Got there early (10:30) and realized I probably didn't need to make a reservation since there were only a few people there.  Checked in and they said it would be about 10 minutes ... I understood we were early, but so weird since there were a ton of open tables that they wouldn't just seat us.  After 10 minutes they walked us over about 10 feet to a table that was right in front of us as we stood waiting ... no clue why they didn't plop us down there when we got there???  Took a while for our waitress to take our order, which was strange since it wasn't busy at all.  After our party of 5 chatted for a bit we realized it had been quite a while since we ordered and still no food.  Our waitress finally came back to refill our drinks and said our food would be out in a few minutes.  It was 40 minutes from the time we ordered until we got our food (don't know why it took so long to make scrambled eggs), then it was all COLD!  I'm not one to complain about food at restaurants, but I've never gotten food that was so cold like that.  I'm guessing it was ready for a long time and our waitress never got it.  Again, it wasn't busy at all, so I have no clue where she was or what she was doing (someone else brought the food out).  We called the manager over to tell him about our food and ask if there was a reason for the delay and it being cold.  All he said was \"I can get you new food\" with no explanation.  My kids already started eating because they were starving.  Eventually, they brought out new food for two of us.  In the meantime, the place still wasn't crowded, so I can't imagine what it would be like if they were busy!  Our waitress finally came back to refill our water and never said a word about anything.  They did comp one adult meal and one kids meal, but there was never an apology or explanation.  Very disappointed I chose this place for my Mother's Day brunch.  The food was decent, but the service was horrible.  We will never come here again.",

The steak was done medium rare and was very tasteful with just enough juice left in it.  The service was very good and we had a great night.  For all your UFC watching needs this is the place to be.

Texture: Like shoe leather ... took about 5 min to cut a bite and then 5 more to chew enough to just give up, swallow, and call it a day. The taste: indescribably bad.

She handled her self well and was polite even when I knew she was overwhelmed by the table of 13 or so! I had the jalapeno mac and cheese and onion rings I felt the mac and cheese was a little bit salty and not spicy enough for me personally the onion rings were really good but a few of them are a little soggy in the middle but they were huge onion rings so that wasn't that big of a problem consider the size! I also ordered a a Mai Tai and for the cost/size they definitely could have added an extra shot or two...which was the what the others where saying too...so if your gonna order a drink ask for a double cuz they a little stingy with the liquor...LOL",

If it wasn't for the free appetizer that was given for no reason which was a nice gesture probably to receive a better tip I would give 1 star. Better steak houses for a lot cheaper.",

    "text": "What a disappointment. This was our first time here. We had such high hopes for this chop house experience. It's too bad that what we got was barely on par with lunch-room-cafeteria-quality food.  Everything they serve here is delivered cold.   The biscuits and honey butter: cold  The margarine (they don't have butter): cold  The prime rib: cold  The baked potato: cold and under-cooked  For a $30-$60 / plate chop house, this place absolutely sucks.   If this were a $20/plate Sizzler I would have lower expectations, but when I think chop house, I think high-end, high-quality food. This place fails in nearly every imaginable way. In fact Sizzler would have been a step up in quality and temperature.  When I mentioned my food was delivered cold, the manager offered to reheat it for me. I said it needs to be remade. Then, when round 2 of my order arrived, my steak was over cooked.   So the manager must've thought I said the steak was undercooked. I didn't. I said the entire meal was served cold. Now I understand why he wanted to refire it. He didn't take the time to actually hear my comment.   Then, oddly enough, our waitress tells me that it's not their policy to reheat food. So, why did the manager offer that? Very strange.  Ok so they don't have butter (as mentioned above). And the margarine is served ice-box cold so when you apply it to your baked potato (even if you can get one served to you hot) the potato will still be consumed cold. Ugh!  The only high point was our server Janell who was gracious and kind despite our challenges with the food.   At no time did a manager ever return to our table after I pointed out to Janell that my second steak was over cooked.  As a weird consolation prize, after telling our server we don't have room for dessert, she comped two free desserts that we didn't order and that wouldn't keep if we took them home so we left them mostly uneaten on the table. Very strange.  I get the feeling that this place is in need of a bar rescue or kitchen nightmares resuscitation. The choices they make are obviously aimed at saving money but unfortunately they are sacrificing quality.",

Not a problem for me, just don't want someone to get it thinking \"mild heat\".  Mai Tai was great - get it with the Bacardi & Malibu. Yum!

The restaurant was incredibly busy and he still checked on us very frequently and gave great service. A breath of fresh air in a busy and stressful situation! I wrote this review before even leaving the bar because he was so great! 5 stars!",

I know it doesn't taste like a ribeye, but that's what we serve people.\" HELLO! They need new management! What a joke this place is.

Our sever Nicol over charged us for a double Hennessy and only brought a single short glass and said they couldn't do a double, we asked why and she said she didn't know... Like, what the fuck? We also ordered grey goose and she rang us up for kettle one. She was rude, she took forever, I'd understand if it was busy but it was not busy at all.. We ended up leaving and asking for our tab right after our drinks, never coming back. Thank god for yard house though.",

I ordered food and drinks through one of the bartenders over the weekend for my clients and when i went to cash out she told me that she gave my tab to the waiter that was servicing my clients table without acknowledging me first. so instead of my normal bill of $120.00 they charged my card for over $375.00 for the tab. the Manager said I'm sorry this is illegal and should have never happened but wouldn't do anything about it to reverse the charges that weren't mine he asked me if he could buy me a drink instead. worst management and service ever. last time i will ever step foot in this place. I would highly recommend the Whiskey Rose across the Street or Mcfadden Bar.",

Son picked a burger ( there were only 2 - not the vast selection on their posted menu) and I had ceasar salad with chicken... what could possibly go wrong?!? All I I know is at the concert later, we both spent too many times in the rest room - we ate and drank nothing else but water  - and this continues the entire next day...  Conclude what you will but, there is nothing else to say!

Sorry for the long post but I took it from my FB I made about both the Yardhouse and Saddle Ranch at Westgate  I wanted to share my two great customer service experiences I had when I went out last night. We started with dinner at Yard House - Glendale after we placed our order my friends food arrived quickly but my mac-n-cheese was taking a little longer. No big deal we weren't in a rush. The waitress checked on us again a 5 or 10mins later still no mac-n-cheese. Turns out the order wasn't placed because the printer cut it off the slip. The manager was very apologetic and took it off our bill. We didn't ask her to so the gesture was very much appreciated.    After dinner we walked over to Saddle Ranch for a drink grabbed a table on the patio and waited for our waitress and waited and waited and waited. A manager was a couple of tables away working on schedules so I asked her if we needed to go in to the bar to order (we had seen a server pass by a few times) She said absolutely not called someone on her headset and a security guard came by to check on us and took our drink order. He continued to check on us the entire time we were there and informed us the general manager took care of our drinks. When we left I got back to my car and realized I had left my iPhone on the table. I quickly drove around, rushed back to the table (the entire time thinking the worst) only to find it not there. I stopped the waitress and she said the security guy that had been helping us had it. WHEW!! So relieved! In a culture of get em' in get em' out to make more money Thank You Yard House and Saddle Ranch for providing excellent customer service!",

While going through their ridiculous I.D. checking [twice], we finally got our flashing-beeper-thingy.  We waited for about 45 minutes so it wasn't too bad -- after all, it -is- a bar at Westgate.  So our table finally opens up and we all sit down.  We had such a friendly and funny waiter.  I had ordered a Mojito but apparently they didn't have mint leaves.  Damn.  So I had a Texas Tea and two others ordered their fruity drinks [those guys  -_-;;].  Our drinks had arrived in carafes!  After viewing our huuuge drinks [about $12 a pop] and the crazies on the mechanical bull, we all decided to leave after the booze.  Maybe it's not my kind of scene but  I definitely didn't like it there.  So the highlight of that Saturday night:  Denny's.  Hah!",

They do line dancing,ride the bull,etc...It's a bit disconcerting when you first go in-a huge room,with booths along the wall,and seating in the middle,with a full third of the space taken up by the bull. There is a bar,and behind the bar, a few more booths. We preferred sitting there,actually. A bit more quiet and private. As far as the food goes,I think it's more hype than substance. I was actually really disappointed in it. After seeing it on tv in Los Angeles on numerous dating shows,I was anxious to see what it was about.  We went for dinner and had steak-nice selection of food on the menu,and a good selection of sides,but the steaks were just ok.  We also tried it for breakfast on the weekend-we need more breakfast places around here so I was really happy they were open weekend mornings--what can I say-a little disappointing.. The hash browns were actually inedible they were so dry!!! I am not too anxious to try it again!",

We were told the kitchen was understaffed & servers were scarce. There were however 7+ useless young female hostesses standing at the entrance with nothing to do. When I asked to speak to the manager, one of the girls was extremely rude & did not want to bother to get the manager. She simply pointed him out across the restaurant & suggested I go speak to him if I want. When the food arrived, the majority of our party received undercooked steaks, burgers, baked potatoes & vegetables. The tortilla soup was quite possibly the worst I've ever tasted. We didn't even have utensils. The table next to us actually got up & left after never receiving their entrees. We waited another 30 minutes after asking for the check. I would have had a bit more understanding if the restaurant was packed, but there were several empty tables around us which seemed odd for a Saturday night. The response to our concerns were poor at best & only at our suggestion was the meal comped. This was our 1st & last visit to Saddle Ranch. Extremely disappointing.",

    "text": "As far as the night life it's a cowboy themed bar that plays techno house music, that nobody dances to, I don't get it.  Pretty much every one crowds around the token electric bull with drunk after drunk girl getting on (Whhhoooaa!! drunk girl scream), the place has no flow, no energy to it.  The attractive women are few and far between. The door girl and one of the bartenders were good looking girls but the bartender wasn't very friendly, slow, and seemed uninterested in tending that night.  I stood there like 10 minutes trying to order a drink (excuses can I get?... huh no, ok lemme try again, one of those type of deals)  I order my drink and she makes this huge ass like 44oz Bladder buster drink, and its $11 or 12 bucks good deal but she didn't mention the price or how huge it was. I wouldn't have ordered it if I knew, but I didn't want to refuse it and have it tossed out.  I didn't even get close finishing the drink so not a good deal that night.  This really isn't my type of place. I might have been a bit fun if once I got hammered and they had some square dancing going or something that would have been kind of funny.  Also there is this punching speed bag thing that obnoxious RockStar  energy drink t-shirt types like to punch, pretty annoying.  I personally give this place 1 star, but I don't want to be biased so I will give it 2 stars for other people, still not recommended.    If you're a little bit country, and a little bit uhh... techno?",

    "text": "FINALLY!.... ive returned back to Saddle Ranch after a year. And since I popped my Yelp cherry (can I say that on here?) on the Messagewerx review. Figured I might as well make this my 2nd. Ive always liked the decor in Saddle Ranch it fits in with the whole wild west of AZ. and its very open and spacious. We was greeted and seated as soon as we walked in, u never really have to wait for that there. I recommend the sweet tea lemonade alcoholic drink. Our waiter Bryan recommended it to me and my girl and it hit the spot. My girl sucked down the first one and quickly ordered another. She ordered the Cobb salad which is huge and I got the Cali Chicken Wrap with Sweet Potato fries. Both were pretty good.  The prices were a bit steep for some of the things. For instance those drinks were about $14 a pop I believe but I think we were there during Happy Hour. The food wasn't anything that knocks you off your feet, but its not bad by any means. If u hit up Westgate its probably the best place to go cause they always bring a good crowd in the evening hours. Ill probably be back there before another year has passed. I didn't ride the mechanical bull this time. That's reason enough to go back. And make sure u get Bryan with a \"y\" as your waiter. He was fast, came by at just the right times to ask how everything was, had good drink recommendations, and had just a overall good attitude.",

This is perhaps one of the best people watching locations on the west side simply for the fact that they have a mechanical bull. For some reason this device attracts women with skimpy shirts and fake boobs like bees to honey. While sipping on my ginormous long island ice tea, I could not help but utterly enjoy watching people get tossed from the bull, in many instances it was pure comedy. I have yet to eat here but my parents have on two occasions and have had wonderful experiences. The first time they went there they had to wait for a table and the manager walked them over to the bar and bought them a drink. The manager obviously understood that a free bloody mary was the way to my mother's heart and a sure fire way to win repeat business.",

Took us a little while to get our drinks out, and then we ordered our food. It took over an hour to get our food out to us, our server she had only checked on us a couple of times, and didn't after the bread sticks, despite the fact that she saw me looking over at her several times during the meal. About 50 minutes after waiting, I went to go look for her to ask where our food had went, couldn't find her. I did see her as well as other servers hanging out with other tables. The table next to us even had to get their own silverware after the food had been brought out. I ended up walking out, paying for my drink and not even getting out food. I had to go somewhere else to eat completely. The server never came over to apologize about our wait, no manager, no other servers came to check up on us after the biscuits were brought out.I even offered to pay for my drink, which she took a while to bring out the check for that, keeping me their angry even longer.It seems like they are very selective about who they serve, saw a lot of girls hanging out with the guys at the tables while other tables were waiting.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service..I couldn't even find a manager to complain to.",

    "text": "I came by for dinner actually the other day and I have to say that the food was really good.  I had the baby back ribs and they fell right off the bone and BBQ was very sweet and flavorful.  I also got the sweet potato casserole which is practically desert, very sweet.  My friend ordered the ribeye which looked good for the whole 5 minutes before it was digesting in my friends gut.  His wife had the chili and it came in a gigantic kettle looking bowl and she loved it.  The manager Jason came by our table and checked on us and was kind enough to send us a complimentary cotton candy desert that comes in the gigantic martini glass.  I should have taken a picture but I'm sure one will pop up soon.  I've been here many times in the past for late night drinking and love the atmosphere, the bull riding, and of course it is a good size crowd for the west valley.  I will go back now just for food, especially now that I know they serve breakfast!  Wow, does this place ever close?",

    "text": "I was just in this bar last night for a friends birthday, I rarely go out so I was really looking to have a good time. Unfortunately I had a guy call me a pretty disrespectful and demeaning name, which sparked an issue between this guy and I. This guy weighed about 150 pounds more than I did and towered over me, during our shouting match security did nothing while he sat there and threatened me and watched him get closer and closer to my face suggesting violence any time during this situation. I am sick to think that they didnt want to step in, instead, my boyfriend did and WE got thrown out of the bar. Not only that, the police got involved and security did not make any type of statement about the situation making it a \"he said, she said\" bar argument. I am livid!!!! If you ever need any type of security in a situation like this, Saddle Ranch is staffed with a bunch of useless security. Not only am I ticked about this, I was also irritated through out the night at how RUDE the staff was. Some guys walking around in bright shirts that said HOST on the back were very pushy all night, I know the place is crowded but nobody ever said excuse me to get through, I was told to \"get out of the way\". I have never been here during the day, maybe its different, I dont know, but my experience here was absolutely horrible and I am very embarrassed for the dim-wit security here, and I feel extremely disrespected.",

Nadia was the bartender and you can tell she not only loves her job but does it well.  She is quick, efficient and very people centric.  Food was delicious and prepared well.  I was most impressed with Byron who I later learned was a manager and bartender.  I had observed him in constant motion, cleaning up, serving drinks, food, filling up the ice, stacking glasses, you name it.  At one point I thought there were triplets. He seemed to be helping out everywhere and I thought he must be truly dedicated to keeping things flowing well.  I love going here; it is a bit noisy but this is a large eatery with drinks and TV with sports and loads of people. One has to bring their patience with and have appropriate expectations.

    "text": "Since saddle ranch opened I didn't feel I could compose an adequate opinion after only seeing ENORMOUS mixed drinks and women gyrating on a mechanical bull.  I felt I needed to at least try the food to form an opinion.  If you've never been one of the first things you'll notice is that every waitress is dressed like a slutty cowgirl. (personally I don't disapprove) but might not be the place to take grandma, unless she's into that.  Other than that our waitress was actually very attentive.  Ok the food...  I found myself conflicted between the Ranch BBQ Burger and the Original N.Y.O. lucky for me I didn't have to make that choice and my awesome wife agreed to order the Ranch BBQ Burger and let me taste it.  After a short while our food came and all dishes were served on what I can only describe as a slab this thing was like 2 ft wide.  My Omelette was huge filled with black forest ham, three peper bacon which was really tasty and tequilla chicken sausage, not to mention a huge helping of hashbrowns.  Keep in mind this is one of the more modest sized dishes. I also tasted my wife's burger and from the little bite I had I would definitely order it.  The waitress asked us if we would like dessert and we politely declined, despite this they decided to give our party a half baked cookie and ice cream dessert on the house.  Even though we were all really full, the cookie dessert was amazing.  Theres something about saddle ranch that like that  I can't describe, It's tasteless, tacky and everything that usually turns me off.  But whatever it is it has a certain charm to me and day or night I place I would come back to.  Maybe because it's not located in Scottsdale proper.",

    "text": "First time here was for my birthday last year. Even though place was packed we were able to get a table outside after a short wait. I had never been here before but boyfriend had been a few times with his boss so he was giving suggestions as to what was good. We decided to get the sampler platter from the starters menu since it has a little of everything on it. Good choice. And the drinks, like Matt H mentioned in his review, enormous. Even though place was busy, busy, and busy, our server was great. She definitely made us feel as if we were her only table.   Went again this weekend, not knowing there was a hockey game and had fun time trying to find parking that wasn't out in the back 40. At least we got there BEFORE the game was over. Good thing. Once game let out, place was packed to the gills.   Again we sat outside by one of the many patio heaters. Just enough heat to keep the chill off. This time we ordered sandwiches, boyfriend got the club with loaded baked potato and I got the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries. Club sandwich was loaded up pretty good. My gosh, I don't know where they get their chicken for their sandwiches, but my buffalo chicken sandwich was HUGE. It was breaded, cooked and had a good amount of buffalo sauce then sprinkled with Gorgonzola cheese and very moist and flavorful. We both ate maybe half and brought the rest home.  Lunch for the next day.  Now, on to dessert.  Yeah, right.  Haven't had room for it so maybe next time we go we'll just do that.  If their portion size for regular food items is any indication, then the desserts are huge too.  Have seen a couple of desserts they have.  One is a huge silver martini glass with a tower, and I mean tower of cotton candy.  The other, fixins for s'mores.  There are a few fire pits outside that you can roast the marshmallows over.   Will say if the nightlife thing isn't for you, then try this place during the day or early evening.  Can be a family place during those times, but night, not so much.",

Very touristy yet I was impressed with the service. They didn't scrimp on hiring plenty of nubile, young things to seat you, serve you--After all they have too, those \"plates\" look like platters big enough to hold a Chinook Salmon! My steak was alright a little pricey but ok, hey what can you expect, there was even live entertainment, plenty of hot mama's that wanted to ride the mechanical bull on a podium.  I don't give it 5 stars because I dislike huge corporate venues but this place really seemed to care about it's customers and waitstaff by letting them wear basically whatever they want, as long as it was \"Rocker-Style\" --well sort of with a western twist.  Oh yes, their cotton candy was served in this metal martini looking thing and was about 2 feet tall, high and tall I say.  Since they just opened August 30th, they are not even on dexonline yet but easy to find in the Glendale Arena Complex--I'll snap some pix soon.",

The only word I can think of to describe this place is NASTY. N-A-S-T-Y. Nasty. They told us it would be a 15 minute wait and it took 45 minutes for me, my friend, and her son to get a table. They had tables open inside and outside that weren't being used, and weren't being reserved. The hosts could have offered us ANY table and I would have been happy. We told the manager and she make some rude remark telling us it wasn't that long of a wait. Our server was boring, didn't smile, and was uneducated about the menu. She was probably just miserable working at this place because her poor attitude doesn't get her any tips. We ordered a side of fries and the Monster platter. The fries came out first and not even kidding... they tasted worse than McDonalds. You could just taste the nasty aftertaste of the oil that it probably was sitting in all day. The Monster platter came out and it was SCARY. The wings were SO dry that they could be labeled as beef jerky on the menu. The onion rings were battered, I mean battered with greasy, used up motor oil. Disgusting! The cheeseburgers were worse than the ones the I had at the cafeteria in high school. The buns were soooo dry that I think they could be compared to the hockey pucks from the Coyotes Stadium. I think the only thing I liked on that platter was carrots and celery. Not even the ranch and blue cheese was good! Oh- and the beer was good. That's it. I told the manager hey- it seems like our platter has been sitting out for a while. He said it was fresh, and he lied. I guarantee he lied. PLEASE, TO SAVE EVERYONE IN GLENDALE ARIZONA, CLOSE THIS PLACE DOWN!!! IN THE NAME OF JESUS, AMEN!",

He brought us over shots and cotton candy on the house. he was just great. he got a great tip that night.",

    "text": "I was here last night after the game. The place was packed full. There was bull riding and cotton candy served in very large metal martini glasses. We asked for a table for dinner with a 30 min wait. This was not surprising and we got a table sooner then what they guessed.  However the place was so packed that I lost the host trying to navigate us to our table.  So I went back to the host stand and explained I lost my party. They did not lead me to my table when I ask where my party went. The guy just told me they were somewhere in the front and pointed in a general area. I had to text my date to come and get me. The waitress was friendly and always checked in on us regularly.  The part that really sucked, after we placed our order my date wanted to show me the fire pit to ask I wanted to roast marshmallows.  We left our drinks on the table and we're gone less then 3 minutes.  In that time the host sat another party at the table and took our drinks away. It was bad enough that we lost our table but it was horrible that my $15 drink was taken before I had even had a chance to try it. I think they should have given me my drink back instead of making me buy a new one.",

This is just another tired bar trying to squeeze a few more bucks out of those of us too stupid to eat out at Westgate. We were not all that hungry so we ended up having one drink each, one appetizer, one salad and one sandwich.  Total cost $80. WTF? 80 bucks for three drinks and minimal food? Are you freaking kidding me? This place calls itself a chop house. I can get better food at Subway. I have had super crappy dining experiences at Westgate on a number of occasions so my thought was why order chicken when for $2 more you can get beef. Less likely make me sick, right?  Ugh...The French dip was about as appealing as a hot dog bun with some dollar store meat heated in a microwave.  The oh so wonderful spinach dip recommended by our waitress came with a heaping of stale gross chips. Large Stella? Plastic glass and all of 20 ounces at best. I was charged close to $11 for that crap...Ug....why do I ever go to Westgate? Every restaurant here is a shit show.",

    "text": "Located in the Westgate Center. Plenty of parking, especially slow on Tuesday at lunch time . Was almost like ghost town empty. Went to Calico Jacks first but they were not open at about 12:15 pm although sign said open and saw some movement inside, but my spidey senses said move on. Saddle ranch right across the way was open so we scooted on over in the 110+ heat to the ranch. Kinda cool outside they had complimentary lemonade and  water. The decor was kinda western themed and not to big of a restaurant. Nice big bar in the center of the room. The have some really cool signs all over the restaurant with funny sayings ( nice touch). After being seated the manager Julie came over and greeted us and then the 5 star service began. We got drinks and asked her what she recommended. She gave us a list of 3. I went with the sloppy joe and fries. The drink service was tops with glasses never more than 60% empty without replacement or being asked if we wanted more. The food came out presented very nicely on a western themed metal platter. The beef looked like ground steak they did in house as its a steakhouse. The meat was cooked perfectly and excellent mix of house seasonings and a jack daniels sauce I think. The tiny onions mixed in perfectly. The bun is hard to master but they did it. Usually the bread falls apart at many places.... No dice it held up extremely well. It was perfect. They serve a bunch of fries, whatever they were uhhh fries. So after treating me like the king, she brings out this outrageous mountain of cotton candy. We could barely dent this 8th wonder of the world, so she bagged it up to go. She bought the dessert... How sweet it is. Overall great experience and I'll be back for sure. See Julie, it's like getting a new really cool friend. Thanks",

So, let me start with the service is outstanding with Byron at the bar but he was very friendly fast and very informative of the menu. I got the combo Chicken & Ribs which both were outstanding.  the flavors on the ribs just popped in your mouth it made me smile with all of the goodness going on in my mouth. You should try it to get the flavorful excitement and  experience what I can't put into words.  so the chicken had a lot of flavors in itself along with the jasmine rice and cilantro. I would recommend this and I will come back. Thanks Byron for awesome service",

A bunch of friends and I stopped on by after a night of bowling. We all walk in together and the security at the front brushed us off. We all head to the bar and wait on the bartender, only a couple of us were getting drinks cause the other half were DDs, and right away I get pulled to the side and asked to see my ID. At this point I'm annoyed because I extended my ID to the security man at the door and he waved us away. I asked him why is it that he's pulling us aside when we previously offered Our IDs and was ignored. He then asks how much have I had to drink. What does it matter if I'm not ordering drinks? I told him I'm the DD and I'm not ordering anything and why exactly does it matter to him. He then said its because we were loud. Mind you, we all work in a loud warehouse so the volume of our voices have to be loud in order to hear one another. I then explained that to him, even expressing that I didn't feel the need to explain why. Needless to say the guy was a jerk and the bartenders were rude as well. Overly priced drinks, lazy staff, is what you're getting here. I didn't mind the prices before, but it doesn't sit well when you're being treated like crap.",

The jalapeno macaroni is absolutely amazing. Our first couple visits were great, we typically go before its busy or early on in happy hour. This past Sunday we went for lunch when it was far from bust. Our waiter came and introduced himself and was very friendly. However he seemed very distracted throughout our meal. Many of our requests such as asking for sweetener for tea were forgotten and he offered refills but didn't return with them for a good 15-20 min. I will say this is the first time we have had less than great service and by no means does that mean this particular waiter is bad, he just wasn't great on Sunday. Will always recommend this restaurant for great food.",

The service was poor, it took over 1/2 hour for drinks to arrive even though it wasn't busy.  The food runner was so lackadaisical it was comical.  There was something wrong with all of our entrees, with five people you must really have to work to mess something up on each plate. The manager tried to compensate by bringing us free dessert but we left after waiting over 1/2 hour for that.  For the money the quality of ingredients was very poor.  Let us all be grateful that there are other restaurants!",

When we mentioned it to the wait staff she laughed and said \"if you catch it you can keep it.\" They didn't seem to care at all. I was ready to leave after that but my husband wanted to give it a try. The table next to us left right when we got there but their dirty plates sat there for about 20 mins and they were not even busy. My husband ordered a rare steak and they served him a medium one. He isn't one to complain or make a big deal so he just ate it. One bite into our meals and the server came to ask how it was then we saw her once to refill our drinks when we were pretty much done. We had to ask the manager for a box and our check. After the manager gave us a box she came by to give us free shots. My husband and I both agreed that the shots were the best tasting thing we had and the brussel sprouts we got for an appetizer. I will say when our server was waiting on us she was friendly and the manager.",

Come to find out the Coyotes had a preseason game and when there's some type of activities going on they use a limited menu to get people in and out quickly. Which is not uncommon and a smart business move.  So we where in the area and went back tonight and found out Tuesday is all you can eat ribs. So that's what I got and my wife got the Bacon BBQ Burger. The ribs were great. They came with 2 sides which I was unable to eat because I was focused on the ribs. My loved her burger. The service was great. The waitress was always on time and kept us happy. The manager came by and checked on us twice and was very nice as well. Highly recommend this restaurant. Cost was fair.",

The nachos is a HUGE plate and can definitely feed 2-3 people all while enjoying the nice sports bar atmosphere. I usually get the steak and BBQ chicken on it and it is FABULOUS!  The nachos are crisp and the cheese is too die for. The servers can be late with drinks at times, but they're overall friendly and worth the 30 minute drive.

    "text": "If I could give negative stars, I would give this place a negative 5 stars! This place is HORRIBLE! Service was the WORST I've had ANYWHERE! We had about a 35 minute wait, which we expected since we were there for the Blackhawks/Coyotes game. We were finally sat about 5:30pm. It took until 5:45 before someone came to take our drink order. By then, we already knew what we wanted for dinner. So we placed our order. I ordered an appetizer of chicken tenders and a side of sweet potato fries. My husband got the steak sandwich with regular fries. Our server brought our drinks about 5 minutes later, and that was the last time we saw her.   That is, until I went to the front and asked for the manager 30 minutes later. The manager didn't come, but our server came over and we asked her where our food was and that we wanted refills of our drinks. She brought our drinks, but didn't bring our food. Another 15 minutes went by, still no manager and still no food. So my husband got pissed and said we would just get food at the game. Our server was walking by, so he walked into her path and told her we were leaving because we still didn't have our food, but we would pay for our drinks. She told him not to worry about it. I went looking for a manager because 45 minutes was a ridiculous amount of time to wait for food, no matter how busy the place was.   I finally flagged down the girl at the front and she found a manager for me. The manager came over, we told him the issues and he said he would get our food right out. As he said that, our food came out. It was 6:30 by this time. He took our bill from the table and said, \"let me see what I can do.\" and walked away. 5 minutes later as we were scarfing down our food, he came back and said, \"I took care of the sweet potato fries and gave you 20% off the rest of the food.\" WTF?! Seriously??? 20% isn't crap! Giving us a 20% discount is like giving us the middle finger. The manager should have just taken care of the entire bill.   Never ever EVER going to that place again! Will go back to the Whisky Rose again!",

    "text": "Second visit and boy it's like night and day.   Our first visit was a Sunday night.. place was night busy, server was very attentive.  We even got a free side of jalapeno mac and cheese which was delicious.   I ordered fried chicken breast which turned out to be mostly breading on a very thin piece of chicken.  The breading fell off all of it as I tried to cut it.  We visited for the second time on a Friday night.   I made reservations through OpenTable and commented that we wanted a booth.  When we arrived there was no wait.. but there also wasn't a booth to be had.  Our waitress spent 90% of her time in the kitchen.   We spent alot of time waiting on her.. waiting on drinks, etc.   When we could catch her to remind her about a glass of water or a bottle of ketchup she'd go do 2 or 3 other things before making a trip for what we'd asked for.   One drink sat at the bar while we watched her at the table right next to it.  When she walked the other way, I went to the bar and retrieved it.    The nachos were sparse for almost $15 ($12 plus $3 for chicken on them).   Our food came out one meal at a time and the last of the 4 orders (a burger) took forever and was done without the thousand island dressing on it that had been requested.    I have also found some inconsistencies in things.  Our first time there, we brought home an order of jalapeno mac and cheese to go.  It came in a large box.  Tonight we ordered the same thing, the same price and what we got was in a considerably smaller box and a lot smaller portion.  We waited so long so many times for the waitress on the second visit that I want to the counter to order our 3 to-go orders.   The waitress must have seen me because all the sudden she appeared right next to the person I was talking to.  I'm sure she assumed I was complaining about her.  There are so many options for food in Westgate that Saddle Ranch needs to step up their game and be more consistent.   I'll be heading back to Whiskey Rose next time I am in the neighborhood.",

Well celebrating with them means a limited menu as they consider Christmas an \"event\". Oh and.. They were out of nearly everything. Now let's talk about their Mac n cheese...   They used to have what I considered the best Mac n cheese ever, it was their truffle Mac n cheese, served in a large skillet oozing with creamy cheesy goodness. They changed the menu so now it is in a tiny skillet. I still hoped for the best and gave it a taste.. Well it is now spicy. Mind you I ordered the truffle one,not the jalapeno one. So we complained and were told that IS the truffle one. They use a \"queso\" cheese in all of their Mac n cheeses now. Translation? Less costly. I couldn't taste the truffle in it and other that some small chopped pieces that could have been regular mushrooms, there was no real evidence it was there.   Drinks. They used to have a pretty amazing Moscow mule. That's gone. They don't even carry ginger beer anymore to make it. Don't they know what the drink trends are right now?  Service.. I'll give the guy behind the bar a break in not serving is for the first 5ish or so minutes we sat there, he was new and in training. Our order was wrong numerous times. Even our bill came with someone else's food listed on it.   I'm heartbroken at how far down this place has plummeted to. It used to be pretty good service, great food and drinks. We will be spending our money elsewhere.",

AND she even  bought our table a few rounds of shots! .... Kickass!!).    The manager was attentive, too... after convincing my drunken butt to get on the bull, he presented me with a gift bag with a hot pair of knickers inside that had their logo and some skanky phrase printed on it... I've never worn them, but, hell, I thought that was pretty great for making my evening feel special!  I'd also like to point out that on this particular night, there was a HUGE hockey game (Wings were playing) next door... so even with a busy restaurant, their staff did a great job of providing awesome and memorable service.  I don't recall what I ate (probably because I didn't eat so much as I socialized), but I do recall one of my gal friends (vegetarian) ordered their Sweet Potato fries and it came with this amazing marshmallow dip ... it was so yummy.. finger lickin' good.  I think this is a great place for anyone wanting to start off the night in a fun atmosphere with great staff..

And she said sorry I never got your name.  It was my husbands birthday and I was not happy. We get seated and the table is sticky.

I had to go to the bar to get water and when our food was served we had no utensils or napkins, I went to the kitchen and they said sorry we are washing some right now, we don't have any.

Still don't have our drinks & the drinks they have been brought are all incorrect. When we told our waitress that the drinks were incorrect....she acted like she didn't care or know the difference between a Miller Lite and Michelob Ultra. We witnessed a family waiting at the hostess stand for 10 mins be completely ignored. They got seated by the only bartender and then were paid zero attention once they were sat. They ended up getting up to leave. Asked for limes, got none. Got a pitcher of water with NO GLASSES to pour water in. This place sucks. Don't waste your time here. We had an agenda but unfortunately will be here all day waiting for an omelette.",

    "text": "A group of us were in for the week for a conference and stayed at the Renaissance Hotel. We were happy to see that there were so many options within walking distance of the hotel. One of our colleagues thought this a good option, disregarding the Yelp reviews. We got there at 9 pm and they close at 10 pm but they happily seated us, especially since they were not busy at all. Someone was ridingt the mechanical bull so that was interesting to see.   Our server bounced over to see us and took our order. She was very bubbly, friendly and full of life--I'll take what she is taking please. I ordered the Teriyaki Edamame and a salad with candied walnuts, cranberries, etc. The Edamame was good but a little too sweet for me; however, there was not shortage of teriyaki. The salad was just okay.   I surveyed my other colleagues and the rating was a 3 as their food was just okay as well. The exception to the rating was the veggie burger that someone ordered and said it was a 3.5.   At the end of the meal, our server brought us a large spool of cotton candy. This was more than expected and appreciated. She was great. Even thought, this was done, we could only really give the experience a 3 even though I so wanted it to be a 4.",

My friend got a steak burger & fries, which she really enjoyed, & I ordered the Kettle O' Rings, which I split with another friend previously on a \"hockey date\", as we called it since we were headed to the game after dinner. The Kettle O' Rings are so good & come with a Chipotle Mayo dip & another dipping sauce just as good. The rings are golden brown, perfectly cooked & seasoned, & light, not super heavy as some other places rings are. You definitely get your money's worth! I ate all but 5 of my rings!  We picked a good time to come eat because the restaurant wasn't packed as it has been the few visits I've had before. It was quiet & we ladies enjoyed our meal & had a good looking waiter all to ourselves  He was very efficient & provided us with excellent service.   My friend liked the place & of course I do too.",

We only ordered an appetizer and drinks, mostly because ordering full entrees would've taken too long. The restaurant was not busy in the slightest, with many tables not even in in use. Despite that, our first round of drinks took more than 10 minutes to get out. Two people in our party gave up on ordering a second drink because it would've taken too long. The check took way too long to get out as well, though that's not surprising.   The chips and guacamole were...whatever. Hard to mess up a simple appetizer. Could have had more salsa and guacamole honestly.   I don't live in the area, but I wouldn't recommend this place. Go somewhere else.",

She went back in to the kitchen then I noticed she walked around a different way like she was avoiding us to go ring up another check. I saw another server walk out of the kitchen with 2 plates and walked right past us that's when we left. The staff was practically oblivious to the fact we were even sitting there. They must be trained not to make eye contact. Never once did anyone acknowledge us 1st. Never once did anyone apologize for the slow service. An hour and half of my day wasted.

I was still charged $15.75 for my glass of wine....and left spending a total of $40 for 2 drinks and an appetizer...I did tip the server 20% because I am a server so I don't know if she had other issues going on but honestly the service from the server and food runner were pretty bad too...",

    "text": "i have visited the restaurant on a couple occasions prior to my latest lunch dinning experience and the previous times were not memorable enough good or bad to express an opinion. However my latest experience i have felt compelled to share my thoughts. as we arrived on a saturday after visiting a friend in the area for her graduation party, the atmosphere was of an average weekend gathering with maybe a little bigger crowd than usual. The 3 people i was with ordered a wrap, an omelette, and my original burger medium. had a couple 2 dollar mimosas and began to wait for 1 hour and 30 minutes to be served. now maybe it had to do with the large amount of families or maybe this is a common expectation for a weekend lunch either way i felt this was too long. the kicker is when i received my dry well well done burger i laughed and asked the waiter if they could take it back and and just cancel my order. the wator replied i would be glad to take it back and see if the cook can make you a new order medium done as he agreed this burger was well overcooked. I replied with the fact i am not willing to wait another hour but thanks for the offer. the only good that came out of this was that i am now reassured that my home cooking grass fed beef is not comparable to a restaurant broiler!",

Last night for my birthday we headed there and it was nothing but awful. We ordered our first round of drinks which took 45 minutes to arrive to our table when there was only about 2 other tables sat in the entire place. Our second round we ordered but waited almost an hour with no drinks served and so we got the waitress' attention, canceled our drink order and asked for the check. It then took us asking 4 more times and another 40 minutes for the checks to come and that was only because we got another server and manager involved telling them we were ready to leave and didn't want to walk out on the check. She said the bar was \" backed up\" but there was no one at the bar ordering and the place was rather empty. The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting with water, urine, paper towels and feces all over the floor. Ultimately very disappointed and will not be heading back to this establishment which is saddening because we have season tickets for football and frequently are at Westgate before the games.",

The dinner is expensive, the service is slow, and the staff is always a hit or miss.   Today we came in for Father's Day brunch. Our waitress had no personality whatsoever. Everything was slow. It took forever to get our drinks and even longer to get our food. I would totally understand if it was busy. But it wasn't. That was the main reason we came here. It's never busy for Sunday brunch.   The food was good but the service totally ruined the meal. The other waitresses were giving out the towers of cotton candy to tables, I assume because of the holiday. Our waitress didn't even offer us one. Now our ticket was almost $150 and we had kids at our table. You would think we wouldn't have to ask but we did.

We sat there for 20 min before we could flag down a bar server to ask if we could order.  We quickly ordered, and then waited...finally at 6:30, the bar server was walking by again and we flagged her down. Told her we needed to be served in 5 min or we're leaving. She apologized, about 8 min later as we actually were getting up from the table to leave, she appeared with food. All we'd ordered was a burger and fries, and appetizer of chicken strips. Not a complicated order but my chicken was lukewarm and the burger very well done not medium as ordered. Server did take $10 off meal and was nice but we had to inhale dinner in 10 min to rush to game. It shouldn't take 1 1/4 hours to get this kind of dinner, and that only happened because we flagged someone down. Horrible experience and will never go back.",

My friend had the salmon which she said was delicious (it looked yummy!) In ordered the classic turkey burger with sweet potato fries. It was amazing with the marshmallow sauce. Only critique is that my bun was way smaller than the turkey patty, so it got messy haha. Maybe management has been reading these reviews and making changes...or people just love to be negative.

    "text": "Where to start with such a terrible expierence, the $9 budweisers, the still frozen appetizers, the need for a pre-authorized credit card before I even order.   So let me start with we went here be default because we were on a time crunch before a coyote game, this was not my first choice, and now I know why bar louie and yard house were packed and this place was a ghost town.  I sit down with 3 other people and before ordering the server says that since it is an event day with the coyote game they need to preauthorize my credit card or pay cash as I order, this kinda ticked me off but whatever, I was hungry and in hurry.  We ordered a sampler platter that included sweet potato fries, cheeseburger sliders, \"jumbo wings\", and onion rings.   The wings were served cold and were below average sized wings  The sweet potato fries were undercooked and raw on the inside, but some were warm, until my girlfriend bit into one that was still frozen   My brother ate one of the sliders and spit out a small piece of bone  The onion rings, by far the worst, they were either undercooked with cold onions and hot batter, when you bit into these they would spill water out everywhere turning into an unappetizing mushy mess or the onions themselves were still frozen.  I told the server and she brought a manager over that said he was going to grab a small plate and some of the food and show it to the chef I told him to take the whole plate, we're not eating it anymore. while we were waiting the server brought us some shots on the house for the inconvenience.  The shots tasted like cough syrup and when we asked what it was the server said she had no idea and asked us what it tasted like. Even though 2 of us took the shot, and the other 2 were left, do you really think it is appropriate to bring shots as some sort of compensation for food that bad without first asking? Just because it's Saturday night doesn't mean I'm looking to get hammered.   To wrap this up, I had to ask if they would be removing the sampler platter we barely ate from my bill which they did reluctantly.  And the final damage, for 4 pints of beer... $33 before tip. I'm not cheap, but that is just outrageous.  Avoid this place like the plague, it is part of the reason westgate is failing",

    "text": "Other than a very few handful of places, the Phoenix area isn't noted for dining/drinking districts (say for example like Mill Avenue). Most of them here tend to be popup \"food courts\", usually in malls or near event venues ... like this one. They get busy during an event but I couldn't tell you for a million bucks why people would purposely drive there with the primary intent to eat or drink. Last night was an example of that, a Friday night with a concert event at the arena. The restaurants were packed from about 6 pm until about 7:55 pm and suddenly the place was deserted. The food menu at the Saddle House was a one-page limited \"event menu\" (and of course unlimited drink selections).  Like the surrounding \"theme\" restaurants the wait to be seated at 7 pm was an hour and the service snail-slow. Do the people who own these bar/restaurants not get the concept of staffing and timing to get patrons seated, fed, and out by the time an event starts?  We ended up sitting at a back, almost hidden, bar to eat. The one sole bartender was tasked with taking care of that entire area and, it appears, a good part of the rest of the restaurant. He was working his butt off!  The limited event menu was pretty basic, a few sandwiches and salads (and an unlimited selection of drinks). I had a burger that was about $15, which isn't unreasonable considering the location. It wasn't bad, nor was it great, but if you like fries there were a LOT of fries. Oh, and a pickle.  Bottom line - if you're here for an event this place beats eating stale microwaved pizza inside the arena.  I can't come up with even one reason why I would ever purposely choose to come to the Westgate Entertainment District just to eat/drink, even if it was free, unless I was one of those people who consider this a big step up in fine dining from a regular routine at McDonalds (PS - I'm not).  Other than the hard-working bartender who I give kudos to this place is on my list to avoid.",

We got our name on the list which they said was over an hour. We walked around and we're hungry and found another place that only had about a 10 minute wait. As soon as we sat down there Saddle Ranch text to say our table was ready. We ended up leaving where we were because the others with us really wanted to eat at Saddle.   We got there and were immediately seated... at a soaking wet sticky table.. one of my husbands pet peeves. We were given menus and had our drink order taken immediately which was good. We also got our food order in as we didn't want to miss kickoff. We waited almost 20 minutes to get our WATERS... we would have asked another server if we saw one during that time but we didn't. Once we got our waters it was another 15 minimum to get the drink order. About 30 minutes later our food came out. I ordered my burger with no bun and medium well. I wish I would have gotten a picture but it was literally still raw in the middle.   We scarfed down our food and waited another 15 minutes or so for our server to get the bill so we could pay and leave. The server was nice the 2 times we saw her but the food was not good and the service was so slow that I would not come here again. Almost $100 for slow service and food that wasn't great just will not fly again.",

I feel bad, I can't remember his name, but I think it was Tyler. He didn't have a name tag. He really took great care of us, checking back in and making sure we had everything we needed. And for some reason he brought us a free appetizer and free cotton candy, which was unnecessary but absolutely appreciated.  Food was okay, nothing to get excited about, but the cotton candy was really good, surprisingly fresh. And there was so much that even after eating a LOT, we still took some home. The kids really enjoyed the place, especially the cotton candy.  TL:DR - great service, decent food, fun to walk around Westgate after, even in the heat, thanks to the misters. Good place to take the kids.",

We sat at an empty table since we knew the kitchen was closed and were greeted by a friendly waiter who brought us waters and did not have any expectations. I've never had such great service in my life.  He even provided this level of service after we explained we didn't have any cash to give as a tip and none of us wanted a drink at this point.

Let me start off by saying I worked here like 6 years ago as a hostess and it was okay, there is new management now and they're awful. I called two weeks in advance to make reservations for a group of 22 for my birthday. They said it was no problem accommodating the large table. I figured they would have sufficient staffing and servers to cover our table. Well that's where it went wrong to begin with. There was ONE server and I feel like she was trying her best but our drinks were always empty, had to ask for corn bread and biscuits (which are free) because we were dying of starvation. Those weren't even warm but we still ate them. We sat down at 6:30 ordered by 6:50 and for our food at 8:10. Around 7:30 my mom spoke to a manager to get an additional server to help, she said she would but she never got one. We had to ask for silverware then we see them getting the silverware together!! Barley putting it in the napkins. Excuse me why don't you have your shit together already?!  Next, the food came...and it was AWFUL. DISGUSTING, not even luke warm, and the sad part is everyone's food was cold! About 5 of us ordered burgers WELL DONE and they were not WELL DONE at all. There was so much pink in it we had to stop eating it. My brother and friend ordered nachos and the cheese was so cold and hard and the chicken and steak was cold.  I then asked for the manager and complained about how disgusting the food was. She wasn't apologetic AT ALL. Not one sorry came out of her mouth all she said was \"okay\". I then demanded a discount off everyone's bill and she gave 15% off but to be honest the entire bill should've been compd with how awful the food and service was. I mean everyone's plate was practically full. Be warned and do not come here. Absolutely awful, less then mediocre service and food. And the manager sucks at her job!",

Our waiter, Adrian ordered us a free appetizer of sweet potato fries as my wife couldn't decide between the vegetables or the sweet potato fries.  She ultimately decided on the vegetables and then Adrian surprised us with the appetizer.   It was very appreciated!  The manager, Rosalie also came over to ask us how our dining experience was, which we appreciated as well.  Great job - we'll be back!",

I truly only wish the best for her.   The food was great, the baby back ribs in my opinion were better than Lucille's ribs. Their chicken strips (appetizer) were so good, better than any other regular chicken strips. They were huge strips and it just have been something they coated it with.   We ordered 2 beer towers and along with that our server Megan, gifted us shots. She was amazing. She made sure everyone was good and checked on us often.   We are definitely coming back again. What an amazing night.",

The fries were the best part of the BLT meal and the hash browns were the best part of the eggs Benedict brunch meal. Actually, I take that back. The best part of both meals were the biscuits and jalapeno cornbread muffins that came with cinnamon butter. I would keep going back for that basket of carbs! We waited too long for our food both times too. I would say it took about 45 minutes to an hour for our food. There are better places to eat at Westgate. The drinks are pretty strong so that can be a plus depending on which way you look at it.",

We left a little earlier than usual from our Chandler home.  Got to the Chop House by 10:30ish.  On game days, they have an abbreviated menu with breakfast items, sandwiches, salads, burgers, and 2 steaks.  The non-breakfast items they do not start serving until 11, so we enjoyed our beverages.  I got the Ranch Club, hold the mayo and it was GOOD.  Sourdough bread was lightly toasted, the ham, bacon very tasty.  I upgraded to the sweet potato fries...holy cow are they generous with the fries.  The son and husband got huge burgers and enjoyed them.  The daughter got the club wrap and enjoyed it as well.  We were in a smaller room and able to see several games on the TVs.  I will definitely re-visit this place over the Yardhouse.    Our server was friendly.  There was a slight wait for our order, but not too bad.  Either way it scored us a free dessert surprise from mgmt.  I LOVE proactive mgmt.  Maybe the owners/mgrs of SR Chop House can buy out the horrible ownership/mgmt of Bitzee Mama's.  See my review of that restaurant for my dining in hell story of 2008.  Bitzee's doesn't hesitate to make you wait...and for crappy food no less.  After a full season, my choices for dining pre-game:  Chop House Native New Yorker (if hankering for wings, yum) Yardhouse Cracker Barrel Johnny Rockets McDonalds Waffle House Quik Trip Bitzee Mama's if someone puts a gun to my child's head or gives me $10K",

Because it was my sister's birthday, they gave her free cotton candy.  Cotton Candy?!  I thought the same thing.  It was pretty awesome though.

My husband was not impressed with the cowboy burger - which says 3 pieces of bacon, but my husband's had only 2. The bonus was that our waiter gave us a free kamikaze each, tasty, though even their shot glasses are plastic.

Awesome drink specials in the AM, $1.99 mimosas and bloody mary's, Yes please! Thank you! The lay out of this one I think is a bit cooler than the others. There is a fun up-stars part with a few table, larger area for the bull riding but I think the patio is a little smaller.   Saddle Ranch is always a good time! make sure to get a friend to ride the bull. Convinced my friend Bryan to ride is backwards on a dare once, almost peed my pants I was laughing so hard. Awesome!",

Don't bother ordering the kids mac n cheese, it's comes with a small amount of nasty french fries and in a tiny bowl like it was from a cafeteria or buffet. It tasted like crap. The \"jumbo\" shrimp looked so questionable that we didn't even want to taste it. Plus, it was 11 dollars to add on FOUR pieces of frozen, old \"shrimp\". Everything was crap! And don't try to get a plate split in the kitchen because and I quote \"oh, they don't do that, they're weird back there\". Gee, thanks for letting me know weird people are preparing my meal! They need to hire a competent staff and a manager that knows how to manage his restaurant! Totally disappointed! Oh yeah, we waited so long for beer from the waitress that it was room temperature. Yuck. Don't waste your time or money. These other reviews that had a good experience must be paid to say such B.S. Terrible ownership and management for a place that had so much potential.",

They took away our meals to examine them and then made us pay the bill (over $300).  Told us that corporate would call the next day to resolve the issue and refund us.  Corporate called and told me that because we ate our food we would have to pay.  I explained that we couldn't finish our meal and there was no way we ate all the food.  I have never in my life had such bad customer service - both at the restaurant and from a corporate level.  They should be ashamed of their behavior.

    "text": "Let's see....where to begin. There was so much wrong that my head is still spinning.   A group of us went here last night for a friends 40th birthday. Being 7 o'clock Saturday night, we expected the place to be slammed, but it wasn't, with several tables empty.  Let's being with the service. Terrible; nonexistent. The 6 of us were sat in a section the same time another party of 12 sat. Our drink order was taken fairly quickly. Nothing difficult, waters and iced tea. After about 10 minutes we realized that we hadn't received our drinks, despite 5 staff members standing behind the hostess counter, not 10 feet away, shooting the shit and looking at their phones. We finally went to speak to the manager that if they were going to give this one waitress 2 large parties at the same time, that perhaps someone should give her some help running food and drinks. Despite this, another 5 minutes went by before we saw our drinks. Our order was taken and we began waiting for our food. And we waited, and waited, and waited some more. About 30 minutes, with empty glasses at our tables only filled once. At about the 20 minute mark, the manager stopped by and said our food should be out shortly. I guess 10 minutes is short time. Mind you, still 3 or 4 staff standing idly at the hostess stand. We were there about 2 hours for a meal that should have taken about an hour because of a staff that doesn't give two shits about providing good, prompt service. In fact a woman at the table of 12 complained to another manager and supervisor that was on duty, and as they passed by our table afterwards the supervisor was heard saying, \"How about the attitude on that bitch.\" NOT GOOD, SADDLE RANCH.  And now the food. Ugh. Let's set the stage with what we ordered. Extra thick pork chop with bourbon glaze, baseball sirloin (rare), 2 prime rib (rare, and medium rare), and 2 kids meals. So the food comes out and we dig in. The sirloin came out on point, but was told it was nothing special, with little flavor. The prime ribs were another story. The rare came out medium and the medium rare came out medium well. Naturally we pointed it out and they took them back to the kitchen to fetch the correct cooked items. The manager comes back and says that they had run out of medium rares and that the rare cut that came out was in fact the last rare cut of the night, so naturally it cooked though to medium. Why the didn't tell us this at the time of placing the order is beyond all of us at this point, now that we are nearly an hour into our sitting; so we just dug through the ones that were available. The extra thick chop was about an inch thick. A thick cut should be moist. This was quite possibly the driest chop I've ever had and the glaze was flat and flavorless. All came with veggies and a side. My chop came with about half the portions that the prime ribs received.   I will give the manager a little bit of credit as she brought out 2 deserts and comped one of the prime ribs. This actually saved them from getting zero stars, but it was far little too late. In the 2 hours we were there, our glasses only got filled 3 times. NEVER, NEVER, NEVER AGAIN. This was by far, hands down, the poorest display of service I have ever experienced at an eating establishment.",

We showed up to the restaurant with a party of 12, we had made a reservation several weeks ago for this party size. We showed up at 7:30, ordered our appetizers, and drinks. We got our appetizers pretty quickly, but it took a while for our drinks. Then they took out dinner orders at 8:30, yes, a whole later. Then our food didn't show up to the table until 9:10, seriously 9:10pm. The forgot to add two of the people in our parties food to the order, so they didn't get their food until 9:35. They literally had to watch other people eat in front of them. When we tried to confront management, they just said \"sorry, but the kitchen has been busy all night.\" Then in one final attempt to make up for the poor service, the try to bring us a giant spool of cotton candy that no one asked for. This is one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had (and I've eaten at Sizzler). I will never be back to this place again, and our party was looking for a regular place to come eat when were in town for the Cardinal games. Our bill was close to $600 last night, imagine the gratuity that your servers are missing out on.",

Took a while for them to take our orders; even longer for our drinks; and even longer for our food; and the bread was not brought to us till we asked for it twice. Sadly they brought our food and walked away so quickly they did not ask if we needed anything and we were not able to ask for silverware.  At this point the service was so bad and disappointing we were all laughing about it, because we could not believe it was this bad.  Then the security guy came to us (I guess thinking we were having too much fun) and asked what was wrong. There we sat, a table full of food; no bread, no napkins, and no silverware.  He laughed too and said he thought that was real funny. We were all a little thrown here and asked if he could help because we could not flag down a waitress to save our lives. He laughed even more and he could not find one either so he went and got the silverware and napkins himself. We asked about the bread too but he noted the waitress would bring it and then we all had a good laugh about that possibility. Now most of our food was cold; one of our dishes was not cooked completely (but I will say I took it home finished cooking it and it tasted fine). There we were half through our meal (not me & 1 other in the party, I can not eat uncooked or cold food and I was not going to make everyone miserable with me) no bread, no condiments, no refills when the 1st waitress finally came close enough to snag. She said she would but didn't come back with ours refills till the meal was completely over and yes, and yes again you guessed it...still no bread.  We gave up at this point and ask for our check and asked for a discount due to some of the issues of our meal and never receiving our bread. She promptly came back with our check and wait for it... Our missing very cold bread with butter which was so hard and cold you could not spread it on the rolls.  And of course no discount but the nerve to mention \"I hope you all had a nice time and meal!\"  There was no way that was the case and she knew it. You could tell by the way she looked us and said it. But really complaining never works, you end up looking like the a__ yourself. And shocker we left a tip anyway. But we will never go back to this place, it's  not worth the repeat of torture. There are too many wonderful places to eat in this town to ever go there again. Don't waste your time, money, for the disappointment.",

Not spicy at all, just enough to give it some flavor.  I didn't even put a dent in the plate, and had leftovers for dinner that night.  SR also serves up $2 dollar mimosas with purchase of a meal.

    "text": "Went here last month, July 3 to be exact. It was my first time in AZ and going out at night for some food and drinks after my \"25-hour\" flight sounded awesome. I went out with my fiancee and two of our friends (they live in Phoenix), we arrived, doorman checked our ID's (of course, dude's gotta do his job), 3 of them went in and I was told he CAN'T LET ME IN. By the way, I'm from Guam, a US territory island located in the Pacific. I tried to keep my calm and asked him why he couldn't let me in. I also told him precisely why he SHOULD let me in. This doorman rudely told me I couldn't come in because I'm from Guam and it is not a US territory (I swear he did). And oh, he added more to his statement saying, \"We follow the State of Arizona law blah blah blah...\" And he couldn't elaborate any further. Law? Ok tell me the law! He was looking at me like I was someone who crossed the border and insisted I show him my passport to get in, as if my driver's license wasn't enough. This is the first time I had been insulted SO MUCH in my life being from Guam, on my first night in Arizona, IN FRONT OF OUR FRIENDS and other people. Dude clearly didn't know what he was talking about. What a disappointment. He should get schooled. So that night, he turned me away plus 3 more people who would've been customers. Thankfully, that was the first and last time I was treated so horrible on my vacation. I can't give a review about the food or the bar. I'd really love to but I guess I was off-limits of this place.",

    "text": "We stopped at the Saddle ranch on our way to the Paul McCartney concert, and while the lines were insane everywhere, it didn't take long to get a table.   I recommend hitting the outside bars while you wait, the drinks had a lot less ice, if you know what I'm saying....  The outdoor seating was a better choice too, once the sun went down behind a billboard that is!  I imagine it's a bit hot when the summer comes, but it was so much nice than the indoor mechanical bull scene... for dinner.  (I imagine the indoor bull/bar scene is a happening place to be on a Friday or Saturday night out!  Grab the girlfriends and dress in your best cowgirl gear!  Yeehaw!)  Now the food... Had the artichoke dip, wedge salad-YUM! but definitely share it unless you're only eating an ENTIRE head of lettuce for dinner,  and a filet.  While they didn't bring the steak out rare, as requested, it was very tasty.  Much tastier than I thought I'd be getting from the looks of the place.   (We did wait awhile for food, but totally expected to considering the entire city area was packed for the concert.)  But the best reason of all to drink, eat, and ride a bull (or a cowboy-as some of the shirts recommend) is that when it comes time to tinkle, as us ladies must do.... there are rows of stalls in the ladies room!!!  Ah, finally a place that understands the biggest need of women in bars!!  *I'm putting moderate, but it can easily be spendy if you're drinking.",

I had the monster platter. It contains 3 mini burgers, 6 ribs, sweet potato fries, onion rings, and hot wings. The worst ribs I ever had, they were so over cooked (almost burnt). It seemed like they were either cooked the day before or cooked early in the morning. The burgers were so cold. They seemed like they were sitting on the counter for awhile. I just didn't like flavor of the wings. The three sauces were less than marginal. The sweet potato fries just didn't seem fresh. However, the onion rings were awesome!!! The draft beer tower is a joke $47.50 and it only serves 7-8 less than average size glasses. Here is the the funny part the Corona is consider a premium beer (they charge more). The owner and the manger really should pay more attention to detail or get out of the restaurant business. Obviously they don't care!!! I went there two other couples. None of us will ever eat there again. My visit was on 5/20/2017.",

Apparently, the previous customers got tired of waiting & left after drinking water & eating biscuits.  Menus & flatware were still wrapped in napkins.  While we were waiting (20 minutes) for someone to just ask us what we wanted to drink, we watched 3 other tables sitting across from us, who were there when we arrived, get up & leave because they were tired of waiting.  We would have left, but, we decided to see how long it would take for a server to come by.  Finally, a young lady asked if she could get us something to drink.  Turns out she wasn't our assigned server, but, we told her we were ready to order.  While we were waiting for our food, a manager came over to speak to us.  The Monster Platter was good.  but, the steaks & main entrees were pricey, & probably something we would never order because it would be served cold by the time the server walked approximately 150'+ to get it to our table.  Poor layout for a restaurant.  Kitchen is too far from tables.  As we were leaving we overheard 3 other couples/families complaining about the poor service.  It took us 3 hrs to get served & eat a house salad & appetizer.  Unreal!",

Friends shared the BBQ chicken sandwich and liked it.  Sides were good.   It is on par with the other restaurants around the arena.  I do agree plastic glasses suck.  We all picked up our beers and said plastic? Really?   Probably a 3.5 but I've only been there on a game night.  The place is full inside and on the patio so that says something.

She had us seated and told us I'll get your server, table was not wiped down. I went over to the bar, and asked the bartender for a clean towel. I ended up wiping the table myself. Our waitress came took our order, we noticed another group of customers came in. Same waitress totally forgot about us after her new customers came in. Someone else delivered our food we had no silverware, no salt or pepper shaker on table, no refills on drinks, nothing no checking on us if we needed anything for the 20 mins when we got our food. I myself went to the  bar and ask again the bartender for silverware. thanks for the bartender helping. Overall it was a bad service. I walked out. my mom waited for the waitress and bill, told her everything about her service. All she said was \"SORRY\" and NO TIP for her.

    "text": "1/2 star. Max. I have been to different locations of this chain.  My friend, a University of Phoenix graduate, made reservations here for 12:30 Saturday 5/4 immediately following the ceremony.  A portion of our party arrived early and proceeded to order cocktails, a few apps, etc. Upon the rest of the party's arrival, the service remained decent. It wasn't until we were ready to order and notified the server as such...that our order was not taken for an additional 15-20 minutes.  She instead proceeded to other large party to take their order. Once we finally got our order in...we waited...and waited...and waited for nearly an hour (if not more by some of our party's calculations) for our food. My husband met us for lunch from the other side of town and needless to say...he had to take his food to-go in order to make it to work on time. They did comp his meal entirely as was expected at this point.  Darrell (the so called GM) apologized and made somewhat of an attempt to right the situation with free COLD appetizers prior to the meal arriving and at the end of it giant cotton candy served in large martini style glasses followed by a piss poor dessert of rock hard crumbly brownies. Sorry, that doesn't remedy the situation.  A portion of our meals were comped and rightfully so.  I can understand that they got slammed after graduation...but know your area...and know that there is a COLLEGE GRADUATION right next door to your restaurant!  Getting \"slammed\" is not the guests fault...it's YOUR fault for not staffing appropriately.  When I look around the restaurant and see your hostesses gabbing and standing around while our table fills up with empty and NON-REFILLED glasses and dirty appetizer plates, maybe they need to be trained to do a little bussing as well...i mean, you're ''slammed\" right? All hands on deck?  I guess not.  I will never return to another Saddle Ranch... anywhere...ever. My guess is that many others will not either as this place will not remain open if this is how it's operated. Horrible.",

When I think of my meal this past Friday night, I think of two words: dry and cold. The spinach artichoke dip was just okay - a bit on the dry side and not very cheesy. The onion rings were just okay was well as the batter reminded me of the chicken nuggets at McDonald's, maybe even worse. The BBQ burger (turkey patty) was dry and tasteless as was the bacon. Really? It must take True talent to cook bacon tasteless. There are a few things that the menu has going for itself - a few very unique and fun desserts and drinks that I have yet to see elsewhere. I am fond of the giant pile of cotton candy and, though I'm not much of a beer drinker, the beer tower looks pretty badass.  For me, I came and will continue to come for the fun atmosphere, but I will definitely be staying away from the grub. Adios, cowboy.",

He was very friendly, and told us he'd put in our order, and bring our sever to get our drinks. drinks took about 10 min to receive, and all it was, was simple water;we were also given some stale, and very dry mini biscuits, and even more dry, mini corn bread muffins. those came with a flavored butter, but it was hardly  noticed!! About 30 min of waiting for our apps, they finally came.....and they were pretty much room temp. we ordered the artichoke dip, and the big sample platter. The dip was around $15, and the sample platter was about $25. The dip came in a bread bowl, with chips. It wasn't bad if you like cold, solidified cheese over your dip which  was intended to be warm and melty. The sample platter had 4 little, dry, skimpy ribs, some onion rings,  sweet potatoe fries, a couple wings, and 4 tasty sliders. It also came with 4 dipping sauces. Definitely not worth $25!!!! service was terribly slow, and we will never be back!!!! I wish we would have ready reveiws before wasting our $$!!",

    "text": "DO NOT EAT HERE!  I came on my anniversary of all days, because I'm new to West-gate and nothing late on a Thursday night sounded appealing. I have been to the Scottsdale location once many many years ago and it was appetizers and drinks no food. This time was ATROCIOUS.  Let me begin by saying I was with my 15 month old son, and Husband, and I understand children can be loud and messy and sometimes annoying. However, My son is very well behaved at restaurants and we have been taking him out since he was born with no issues or complaints. That being said, when we got seated they stuck us in the back by the kitchen door....UMM No I do not think so....I immediately said something, mind you this place is DEAD they had maybe 5 tables spread throughout with customers. There was absolutely no reason we should be shoved in the corner by the kitchen door. After being seated in the middle in a more comfortable area. We ordered an appetizer and a cocktail for me and a ice tea for my husband. My drink was  WEAK, this 14$ cocktail tasted like juice with a splash of vodka. I wanted to complain but my husband is against it. Also my menu was dirty it had food all inside it. We ordered the 3 hummus platter, when she brought it out she dropped our pita on the ground, It took 30 minutes to get the pita....ITS F**** PITA I am a CHEF it takes 2 second to make pita, you warm it up!!! I was fuming by then.  We ordered kid sliders for the baby, steak myself and a pork chop for the hubby, he got a potato and veggies i got the sweet potato casserole with veggies.  Lets just say my meal was 25.99$ and my steak was so tiny I couldn't believe my eyes..........this was the cheapest steak on their menu but i really was the size of a Lime!! I ordered it Medium rare it came out medium well with SWEET POTATO FRIES! I SAID CASSEROLE TWICE.  Not to mention the pita FINALLY arrived and it was hard. My sons burgers where so OVER COOKED THEY WERE LIKE ROCKS!!! HE COULDN'T EVEN EAT THEM. I was so upset....But my husband the peace maker who never wants to make a scene didn't want me to complain. I was fuming by now. Our waitress took forever for everything, she never asked if we needed anything, i had to wave her down to get ketchup and ask why i didn't get the casserole. I got the casserole when we were leaving so i asked for it to go. they gave us free cotton candy and a F*ing BILL OF 100.00$ I.....will NEVER EVER go back. This place has the shittest cooks, mediocre waiters and just overpriced food. Go eat at Red Robin, or Rocket Burger or anywhere else but here!!",

However, service was still very good and attentive. Candace, our waitress, was excellent and the manager on duty was checking each table to make sure guests were satisfied as well.  Food was good to decent, both steaks we ordered came out as requested, only complaint was that the rice was badly undercooked so had to dock a star. The nachos appetizer was quite large and our party of three had difficulty finishing it, pretty good value there for those who like to do a little drinking and grubbing.",

    "text": "If I could give this place a1/2 star, or no star at all, I would.  Stopped at Westgate to kill time, bwfore going to the airport, and was the biggest mistake.  First we sat down, and placed drink orders and appetizer orders, then waited 25 mins for those to come out, then placed our lunch orders.  4 different tables were sat after us,  and were waited on and finished 45 mins later.  Finally, after 1 hour our food started to come out, one plate at a time, spaced about 5 mins apart.  Then I was the only one left without my meal, when I asked the waitress where my order was she went to check and came back to say it'd be right out, as the kitchen dropped the ticket with my order... 20 more mins go by and still no buffalo chicken sandwich.  Finally, the manager came to apologize and said my meal was on the house, food would be right out.  15 mins go by and I asked to see the manager again.  He finally came over a couple mins later and proceeded to blame it on the waitress saying she never placed my order. I NEVER got a chance to eat, because when we were getting up, the food finally was delivered to the table.  What a nightmare!!!!!  Do Not Eat here, food was terrible and staff doesnt know how to run business during the day shift.  Seems like it'd be better left as a bar seen. Ugh!",

When we finally asked where my boyfriends tacos were he said they ran out of tortillas. They weren't even going to tell him. Because we were waiting for his entree the rest of ours got cold. I ate half of my turkey burger and it was so salty. Then my friend ordered a coors light and he brought us a blue moon. He then took the blue moon away when we corrected him. He then said we can have one on the house and brought us the old beer back. Dirty plates were left on our table the entire time and he never refilled our drinks. He then said he took the tacos off the bill. When I looked at the bill it only took $5 dollars off the $10 worth of tacos. This server was awful and they took no pride in customer service.",

I had chicken tacos and the tortillas were a little tough; I ended up having to cut them and eat it with a fork, then I just gave up and ate the filling only.  What I didn't like was it was so noisy!  You could barely hold a conversation.  We were having dinner with friends we hadn't seen in years so there was a lot of catching up to do.  Probably our fault for not choosing better.  If you want a fun place, go!  Have fun.  If you want somewhere that you can have a decent conversation, choose somewhere else.",

Took forever to get our first round of drinks because the \"bar was backed up\" with the dozen other people in the building (they did apologize for that, and comped our next round, that was nice). Food was cooked wrong, the menu included items they don't even have, and we kinda wanted another round when the server brought our bill out. Then the bill was all jumbled up. My food was on one tab, my drinks on another. Plastic drinking cups were cracked and dirty. The girls want to give it another try, but I'm pretty sure I'm done with Saddle Ranch.",

We said fine and manager said we are top of the list. In the meantime they sat 4 tables of 4 and 5 people. Wasn't seat until 5:45pm. Ordered only appetizers to expedite service. At 6:30pm the food had not yet arrived. OUTRAGEOUS! No refills on water. Drinks took 20 minutes. Food came wrong from what was ordered or without sides. Manager sent over nachos, rather than comping part of the bill, as an apology. Not even close to good enough for the situation but a nice gesture. Totally disgusted.

His sandwich was served hot and stuffed with meat. He liked the sweet potato fries and marshmallow cinnamon dip. We both had passion tea. My pizza was made fresh and was a True artisan pizza. Very unique. It was our first time in so we were treated to cotton candy (cherry cheesecake flavor) for dessert which is quite a nice and different added touch. The portions are large so we took boxes home. Our server was Steve and he was very attentive. The manager came by and introduced himself. The place wasn't busy but there were people coming and going.

The second time was a few months ago when we had gone to McFaddens for drinks.  My wife apparently had a few too many 7 and 7's and decided(without my input) that she was going to \"ride the bull\" at the Saddle Ranch.  So, We made our way into the bar area and she paid the $3 fee and signed the release papers.  She was then taken to the bull and seated on top, awaiting the beginning of the ride.  I asked the operator to \"take it easy on her\".  He did not listen or did not care.  The bull started to move and made less than one rotation and she fell off, landing on her back, facing straight up looking at the bull.  I am not sure she knew what happened or how quickly it happened.  Needless to say her mechanical bull riding days are over.  Hopefully anyways!    This place is worth a visit.  You will have a good time.",

She wouldn't serve me which I understood because I had an up and down California id.(although I'm almost 24 lol) I told her the law was stupid and she asked me to say it again so I proceeded like she was asking because she didn't hear me not because she was acting like a smart ass. She then snatched the two drinks out of my friends hands that they ordered  and started yelling security security!! Frantically like she was about to be mugged or hurt. I left immediately before security even came because this was out of line and totally ridiculous. I was very unhappy with the poor service, the way she treated me and way she acted towards me and my group. We had just got there and were not drunk or out of line what so ever. Hope you guys can make better hiring choices in the future. All other employees were friendly and awesome except for her:(",

I honestly didn't expect much, but I  am glad to say the Saddle ranch far exceeded my expectations! There's always a vastly mixed crowd. Men in suits and ties, women penis necklaces celebrating a bachelorette party, families, older, younger, frat boys and sorority chicks and every one seems to have a great time. While the food is really good, I will say its nothing earth shattering. It's all tasty and the portions are big. You can't really go wrong. Tryi the smores for dessert!",

We headed over, and while it wasn't 11 am yet, they said we could order off of the breakfast or lunch menu.  The mimosas and marys were good - my brother didn't think the \"Death Valley\" was hot enough, but he's pretty weird.  I got a sweet & sour mimosa, champagne, cranberry juice and champagne, and it was wonderful.  Then came the food.  Our group split about even between breakfast and lunch, and the portions were huge.  While nothing on the plate made me weep for joy, everything was a nice and tasty.  My sliders were probably the smallest portion, which was good, I could barely finish what I got.  Several people in our group needed boxes to take their leftovers.  Service was a wee bit slow at times, but I am betting the management wasn't paying attention to the events, and didn't think they'd get a post 5k rush - listen up management, when Mandi wants a mimosa, she wants it NOW!  If they weren't so far away from me, I'd head back tonight to try out the steak, but that will have to wait for the next time I'm on the West side.",

It's a bit more laid back and less pretentious than McFadden's tries to be.  Never a cover charge (a plus in my book), and watching fools on the mechanical bull is always good for a few laughs.  A few weeks back in particular we went to the bar in the back just as the bartender was shutting that station down, but she went out of her way to make us all one last drink before she completely closed up shop.  A little customer service like that goes a long way!  As far as food goes I remember is being ok for the most part, aside from the sweet potato fries which were great with the side of cinnamon, marshmallow-ish dip (just try it, it's good).",

Glasses must have been dirty too. Took forever to order and even longer wait for our food. I ordered a burger-medium. Got it medium rare...closer to rare. Service was a joke.

Normally I let things sit for a bit before writing a review...   Tonight I am just too astoundingly pissed off to wait. My dining experienced SUCKED  Pro Tip: DO NOT COME HERE OR EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE AN UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER.  First: We saw a cleared table outside which we were waiting to be seated and had stated we were waiting for an outside seat. Well after we waited and the table was cleared and set, at least 15-20 minutes when there was no wait inside (shoulda known something was amiss right here). We were informed surreptitiously that there wasnt a table available outside as it was for a reservation that hadnt yet arrived.  Second: We ordered our drinks and I was excited to get a liter of tea mixed with Vodka. Well if there was any Vodka in my drink, no one, I LITERALLY MEAN NO ONE, could taste or smell it. So I complained and asked for additional alcohol. $13.50 for a drink that is supposed to be a contain a good amount of alcohol, you think you could taste or smell it slightly right? Well yeah they said it was made properly and wouldnt do anything for me so the waiter got me a shot of vodka which i poured into my drink which guess what? it tasted like there was a hint of alcohol at that point.  Third: This was the worst ribeye i have ever gotten. I requested it to be medium. I do not know how, but they were able to cook the middle medium and half of one side was bloodier than extra rare and the other side was medium rare. I had to get A1 to give it some flavor. This is the first time I have had to ask for A1 in a steakhouse in over a year... *SMH* WTH is wrong with you )(*^&^$'s!  Other stuff: My friends who ordered chicken loved it. My friend who ordered the primerib felt his was as bad as mine and it was covered in lots and lots of fat! So much so that my other friends dog is eating great tonight...  The good things: The waiter who took our order was on point, but was hampered severely by the bartender and the kitchen staff. The mini muffins and biscuits were great. The honey butter was outstanding to go with them.   If you come here prepare to be disappointed or taken advantage of. I was completely and thoroughly unsatisfied with my entire meal. THERE IS NO REASON TO EAT HERE, so dont waste your money, time, or desire to have a good meal. You will likely leave here disappointed unless you order the chicken.",

It was refreshing to see TV's showing music videos instead of entirely dedicated to sports. The music videos are punk, rock, metal, alternative, indie, basically different modes of rock. That was really enjoyable. The service was also excellent, we had a waiter that actually waited on our every need which was also refreshing. He was extremely helpful, friendly, and went out of his way for everything. Big thanks Chris. The food itself was okay, nothing ridiculously special, especially for the price.

The guy was nice enough when scrutinizing my ID, but then he said \"Hey...look up and to your right\". It was pretty confusing, until I spied a little camera that took my mugshot before I could ask what the point was.  \"We have to photograph anyone who's under 25\", he said. Not his fault, and he wasn't being a douche, but this is some 1984 shit that made me feel unwelcome.  OK, done ranting, this bar is tons of fun once you make it inside. Huge tables to chill out and get sloshed with large groups. Drinks are the usual Westgate price, but unlike a couple of other bars, they are made RIGHT. I guess they didn't just hire their bartenders for their boob jobs and bleached hair. My 'chocolate cake' shot was the most delicious $8 I've ever spent.  The crowd is nice, and who could forget the mechanical bull? It's the main attraction of this bar; you can come watch all the sluts from Scottsdale show how they ride. Win.  The most innovative part of this bar is what happens after last call. The blaring music stops, and the kitchen reopens, reverting back to a restaurant until 3:30. I'm wary of all Westgate food, but I have to admit it's a pretty badass idea.  3.5 stars rounded down for that mugshot. I'll become a True fan if their food turns out tasty.",

Such as today, Tuesday, was all you can eat ribs. I was told by our waitress that they didn't do that special during sporting events(the coyotes had a game that night). So I said ok and just ordered a burger. As I was eating my burger the table behind me ordered 3 orders of all you can eat ribs and they were not turned down. So I asked the manager what the deal was. He stated if people complained they were offering that special to them. I thought it was quite rude and a horrible way for a restaurant to handle a new customer. That said I probably won't be back. I just want everyone to know that if there is an event don't plan on getting the advertised specials.",

I hate leaving negative reviews, but I can safely say that was the worst dining experience I've had in many years. The first thing I noticed was the glasses were dirty and covered in water spots. The cornbread they brought out as a starter was dry and flavorless. I ordered one of their specialty drinks to share and the first one came out in a dirty carafe with a bug in it. The second one came out about 15 minutes later and after it was gone, we noticed how dirty that carafe was! So gross.  We ordered their appetizer variety plate. It took a good 30 minutes for this to arrive. The rolls for the sliders were hard and dry.The ribs had some very spicy sauce on them which I did not enjoy, but others might. The wings were ok per my husband. The sweet potato fries and onion rings were fine. No silverware, salt, pepper or ketchup on the table or brought out. The waitress double charged us for the drink we sent back due to the bug. I was very disappointed in our experience here, and not only did we pay about $50 for bad food, a Soda and one drink, we all had upset stomachs all night. Do not recommend.",

To drink we all had mimosas. The food was just ok. The steak was medium rare and nice tasting. The eggs, potatoes and sausage had no real taste and everything was pretty dull. The waitress was really nice and brought us free shots so that was a great gesture. Nobody in my group was completely enamored with their meal. For the price it was a bit of a let down. Will maybe try again in the future due to their good service. Perhaps their dinner might be a bit better. Waitress advised that the nightlife there is awesome so might have to check it out.",

    "text": "By far, one of the best places to go during happy hour, Mon-Fri. 4-6:30. All drinks & all appetizers are 1/2 off. All. The food is great. They have a very large appetizer menu. My favorites on the appetizer menu are the wings (big) $5 during happy hour, ribs (fall of the bone - great flavor) with sweet potato fries or regular fries $6.50 on happy hour, or my favorite of all, The Monster Platter. Huge!! $11 on happy hour. The Monster Platter has wings, ribs, sliders, sweet potato fries, and onion rings!!! It's a must buy! You also get free food before your order comes out, and after you're done. I can't say what it is and spoil it.   They also have a regular priced menu full of all types of food. Average cost is $9 for a big burger, or sandwich. They have full dinners as well.   Drinks - All half off. All good. Only thing not half off are bottles of wine. Bottled beer is $2.50 to give you an idea.   The atmosphere is very cool. Nothing like it around. It's a 2 story western looking saloon with actual & real farming tools, and other western decor hanging all over the walls. There's a mecanical bull. This is not a country bar, though. All the decor is country, but it's far from a country bar, which is great. There's many big tvs everywhere. They show 80's rock videos on some of the tvs, and that's the music you'll hear. The other tvs are showing all sports games. Great place for music or sports.   We love this place. We've been going here for 5 years. Great food. Great atmosphere. Great prices. Fantastic tvs for sports & music videos. The service is top notch.   I've been to all the other places in Westgate. Don't bother. I went to Buffalo Wild Wings during their happy hour. Mistake!  Their wings were $12. I sat there thinking if I was just a few bars over, I'd be paying $5 for more better wings at Saddle Ranch!   Saddle Ranch is huge, and has a very large wrap around patio with 2 outdoor bars. People take advantage of the great happy hour pricing, and come in large groups. Great for any kind of group event, inexpensive, and quality.",

Food wise is not that great, the server was like a crackhead missing some teeth and never check back on us if we needed more drinks.

    "text": "My little brunch crew and I have visited twice now and our experiences were insanely different.  First visit: -Sunday morning, few patrons. -Party of 8. -They organized the table and sat me so I could get a drink and some apps out before rest of my party arrived. -5 separate checks, no issues.  Second visit: -Sunday morning, few patrons.  -Party of 8.  -They told me I couldn't be sat til at least half of my party had arrived, so I had to wait 20 minutes with 3 of my friends til we decided to finally lie and say we were a party of 6 just to be sat and get some drinks. I get that's how some places do it, but it wasn't a packed house, so I don't get why that had to be an issue.  -Drinks were slow to come out because the bar was \"backed up.\" Again, the place was deserted, so that was a little off to us. But, the second round was free due to the slow first round, so that was very nice of them.  -Steak and eggs were overcooked. Rare and under-easy? Nope.  -We ordered a vanilla brioche for a friends birthday, only to be told they don't have it, even though its on the menu. Not that they were out of it, but they just didn't have it.  -5 separate checks were needed, but we got 3 because she said that's all the computer would let her do. We know this not to be True, as that was not the case a month ago. I don't know what the strategy was, but she didn't pair up person to person, so everyones check had someone elses food/drink on it. She also gave us our checks before we were ready to leave. Don't do that. You didn't need that table because there was any sort of wait.   We came for the cheap mimosas and all we got was a reason to find a new place to brunch.",

Ordered the Fried Chicken & Biscuit. Fried chicken was crispy but tasteless. I think they forgot to season the chicken prior to adding the breading. Biscuit was a let down, not light & fluffy like a biscuit should be. It was dense. The bacon gravy had a hint of bacon, but that was it. The dish is considered a signature dish, I expected better. Great place for large parties & if someone if looking for some extra fun, they can try riding the mechanical bull. Wait staff very friendly.",

That one time was when we sat out in the restaurant and we had a waitress with a huge attitude but the manager made it MORE than right. We were there with several friends, and when the manager heard we had a problem, he immediately rectified it. We were very happy with his response.  Every other time, we've sat at the bar, where Ray (awesome!) was the go-to guy. We have always been happy with Ray's service, and with the menu. Their portions are HUGE. They have several mimosas to choose from, and several bloody mary's to choose from. They are all amazing.  We've had several items on the brunch menu, and we've never been displeased. If we lived a tiny bit closer, we'd be a lot more regular at this place. That said, we do make special trips just for their awesome brunch/mimosas/bloody mary's.",

    "text": "Worst experience ever! Myself and my husband went here for dinner with my parents and adult son after our wedding to celebrate. When we checked in we were told that it would be a thirty minute wait so we took a seat at the bar and ordered the monster platter as an appetizer. After an hour we got our seats and ordered our dinners and after an hour and a half we finally got our appetizers. At this point I had my sister and her family and my brother and his girlfriend and a close friend and her husband waiting to meet us at yard house for drinks. I asked to speak to a  manager and told him the situation and asked if he could put some tables together in the almost empty restraunt so my guests could sit with us. After an hour of him not getting back to me and after over 2 hours of waiting I had to get my server and tell him that if we didn't have the check for the drinks and appetizers in 2 minutes we were walking out. So there we all were almost 9pm haven't eaten since early morning because we were getting ready for the wedding we walked over to yard house were seated right away and drinks and food came very fast. Moral of the story if you want to get drunk go to saddle ranch if you want to eat and have a nice experience go elsewhere. Thanks for the memorable time guys SMH.",

    "text": "so i took my mom here on sunday before a concert that was taking place at 3pm at the Gila River Arena next door. When we got to the restaurant it was 1:38pm. I asked the hostess how long the wait for 2 people would be, she told me \"10-15 minutes but should be shorter than that\". So i put my name in and sat down to wait. I get it the place was busy but the table turn around seemed pretty quick so i wasn't worried. Then at around 2:05 i went up to the hostess and asked her about how much longer. the list that i was on wasn't even the list they were working off of at that point. She tells me it shouldn't be that much longer. I then asked her why she told me 10-15 minutes when it was already close to 30 minutes, she snapped at me and yelled \"it's not an exact time i told you it may be around that time.\" to which i stepped back and said, don't yell at me, i just don't understand why you would say a lower time instead of estimating over, especially since you added in the 'should be shorter' phrasing. she then yelled at me again telling me to just 'wait or leave'. I then asked another hostess to speak to a manager. she told me she'd get me one, but never did. I saw a woman who i believed to be the manager and asked her if she was, she replied yes. I told her that i was sorry because i knew it was busy, and recanted what the hostess said. I told her i understood that it was busy, but rudeness like that was unacceptable. She told me she would talk to her. If she did i do not know.  when we finally got seated our server was awesome! she really did a great job. However the rolls that they brought to the table weren't even cooked....pretty much warmed raw dough the food took 25 minutes to come out. All and all HORRIBLE experience, but then again when the first employee you deal with (the hostess wearing a beanie) has a major attitude and disdain to all humans it kind of lets you know what you're in for.",

Tonight we had appetizers and a fruit platter (it's 112 degrees out so too hot for steak) and it was very good. But the highlight of the night was the server. Kayley S. Was one of the best servers we have had in quite some time. And we go out to eat a lot. She was quick but not rushed, accurate, never let our drinks get empty (again, it's 112 degrees so we were quite thirsty), and she never complained about anything. I highly recommend requesting her to go along with the great food and fun atmosphere. We will definitely be back and will most certainly be requesting Kayley when we do.",

I told the waiter that it was medium well when I ordered medium rare. He brought me a new steak that was just as dry but medium rare and not seasoned. I don't know what it is, but the ribeye wasn't good. Wife got the salmon and it was great. Kids got pancakes and burgers from the kids menu. Best part of dinner was garlic mashed potatoes which were delicious. Their mixed vegetables were just warmed up raw veggies which were not good. This restaurant is at Westgate so you are paying for location. Skip this place and go to Shane's in the same plaza or go here and get the pancakes. They do have a mechanical bull which is super cool. It is $3 a ride and you have to be 18 or older for good reason. It was super fun to watch people ride and the friendly staff let the kids sit on the bull for a picture.",

Even though the food is really good this place is not nice enough to justify the upscale prices.  It has a fun atmosphere, but $15 margaritas should not be served in a plastic carafe.   I am sure the cost of that location is astronomical, but I doubt straddling the line between two identities is the way to go.",

I told him I wondered if it was something 'eye roll worthy'.  I guess the rude server didn't know I was with him as I came from the bathroom.  The appetizer and food arrived together.  The onion rings seemed soggy but the dips were tasty.  None of the food was hot, hardly lukewarm.  The baked potato was none too soft and wouldn't even melt the butter.  We had to ask for drink refills.   Then ask where the drink was when he finally came back, he admitted he forgot it...he was the server that was trying.  I saw nothing that resembled a manager.  I didn't ask for one or waste my breath.   The food was extremely sub par and extremely overpriced.   Do NOT go here.  There are plenty of options.   Spend your money elsewhere.   Not sure how this place is still open.   The board of health would probably find food temps totally unacceptable.   My husband's steak that was suppose to be medium was medium well at best.   It had no flavor and seemed to have been cooked the day before.   ALL of the food was lukewarm to cold.  I usually read reviews...sadly I didn't.   Read the reviews...I wish I had.  Sadly it is my fault and a hard lesson learned.",

Manager indicated they put on extra staff to take care of us and they did just that. The food was great but the staff spoiled us.  They comp'd us some drinks and desserts. Food came out fast, hot and as ordered. Food was good and a reasonable price. Finished it off with a bunch of people in our group riding the mechanical bull. It was a great outing of food, drinks, and entertainment. Thanks for the great experience Saddle Ranch!",

I understand it was busy due to a big event around, but they were plenty staffed and warned the event was coming. It wasn't that busy in our servers section so not sure why service was so slow. He was nice but didn't really pay attention. I'm not sure if it was his fault or kitchens but all four of our dishes came out wrong. Randomly my friends had no bacon, my other friends came without extras he ordered, one was cold and my salad literally was a bowl of lettuce. I ordered the ranch salad with chicken and I got a bowl of lettuce with barely any cheese and that was it. I asked for my chicken and my server acted like it was my fault. For $16 for a salad I expect more than lettuce with a ramekin of chicken for $4 extra.   Later that night I had a steak dinner and two drinks for only a bit more. Had I'd know this place would be so terrible I would've skipped lunch. $16 on a bowl of lettuce is terrible.. I've had way better salads for a fraction of the price. For $16 I can get a pretty awesome burger and drink at better places.   Last time I go to this place that's for sure. Pathetic service and food was lame.",

My best friend tore her ACL at a neighboring restaurant and we were sitting outside on a green bench, near where they dispose all of the restaurants trash. They saw my friend crying and immediately ran out to get ice and tape to let me tape her up until I could get her to the hospital. We have been to saddle ranch previously, but never had the opportunity to meet the back of the house staff. These men helped me scoop her into my car so I could take her to the ER immediately. I wish I had asked their names but unfortunately didn't think of it at the time. I feel like management should definitely give them a big thumbs up and some kind of recognition. I am so thankful for these two!   This food is also amazing! Like I said we come here often. They have a huge menu, with all types, so that everyone can find something delicious to eat. The front of house staff is prompt and fun! The ambiance is great! I would say it's totally kid friendly during lunch! I can definitely say Sat./Fri. is so much fun!",

We had ONE server to take care of all of us. Drinks took a day and half. By the time our food order was taken, all of our drinks were empty. We had to ask for silverware and corn bread/muffins (those are included like chips and salsa at a mexican restaurant) we then had to ask the manager for another server to help because the one we had was in over her head. She was doing her best but could not do it on her own. We then had drinks refilled and started receiving food. We ordered nachos and fries. Our nachos were cold! Not somewhat hot, or even warm... COLD. Some other people order burgers well done... the picture shows what a \"well done\" burger looked like. Overall, the food was not even mediocre, it was just plain trash. We advised the manager of everything (again) and she said. \"Okay\" and walked away... we received a 15% discount and well we will never be back. Only good thing was their beer. Nice and cold. Avoid this place. Other than drinks. It's a waste.",

This place does have  a quick turn over, that is why sometimes people complain about the empty tables.  It takes a while to get them clean (I have seen the bus boys busting their buts to do so).  The food is a bit over priced, but when you are willing to go out and quite a bit of food, be prepared.  The drinks are overpriced, no doubt about it...but it's the experience you are paying for, the bull, the environment and the people.

But no matter what, we will make sure to accommodate you!\"  When we arrived 20 minutes later they already had two long tables set up for us! Steven got us all settled and got right to taking our drink orders. We asked him if he was able to get any other servers to come in. He said no but that there was a server that was scheduled to be in at 2:00. (It was only 1:00). So it was just Steven and his manager. Drinks came out quickly and then all of a sudden (maybe 1:15?) we had another server named Silk. We asked him if he was the server that was scheduled for 2:00 and he said yes. He got the call asking him if he could come in early so he rushed to get here! He and Steven were so organized, friendly and totally efficient! AND at the end of our meal they brought a bunch of FREE desserts (and free yummy shots for the adults!) I cannot speak more highly of this crew and the food was delicious too!!!

Staff: The server we had was extremely polite.  We took a long time deciding on a meal and she was more than friendly about giving us more time without ignoring us for 20 minutes before returning.  Recommendation: Their Spinach and Cheese dip is served with tortilla chips in a bread bowl.   Very good and very filling  Other: Only comment would be that there were a few gnats hanging over our food but I don't honestly blame Saddle Ranch for that.  It's hot and the doors are open for a breeze.  Not much to be done.",

Most steak houses you order sides with your steak that you have no intention of eating cause, well, the sides usually suck. Not here. The mixed veggies are seasoned, buttered, and roasted. So is the asparagus. The rice is cilantro and has great flavor. French fries are some of the best restaurant fries around, and the chicken strips are hand breaded with very thin breading and a whole lot of chicken.  Each time we've been greeted by a manager and our servers (Naomi the 2nd time) were attentive and fun. Can't forget the amazing half baked cookie. So good. We'll be back!",

The jalapeno Mac and cheese was a bit thick.   They lost 1 star because it took 20 minutes to get our drinks. They lost a second star when my friend's food came out cold....

It would have been nice if it was at least of \"chop house\" quality but it was just like any other piece of meat you would find at the local Jonny Rockets. To top it all off, I was over charged when the bill came out and burned the midnight oil waiting for our waitress to fix the mistake. Trying to pull a fast one on an out-of-towner...

We ordered a variety of food, from salad to prime rib. I had the BBQ cheeseburger, which I would order again.

When I finally arrived, I was disappointed that they didn't serve there full menu this night. I was looking forward to trying their BBQ combination. What a waste of time to eat a hamburger. Never again.",

Highly recommend! Byron the bartender uses his experience to dazzle us and make us feel extremely welcome. And of course the drinks were amazing. Try the \"Candied Apple\". It won't disappoint.",

I thought, \"Saddle Ranch is big and I'm sure it'll be pretty empty at breakfast.\" I really wasn't expecting great food just somewhere we could all get together. I called an hour before they opened expecting to leave a message and someone answered. She took care of our reservation for 24... Yes 24 lol. She let the cook and staff know ahead of time and they were ready for us. We got our food in a timely manner and the manager checked on us several times. They mixed up one order but quickly corrected it apologizing profusely. I had the pancake breakfast it was good. There maple peppered bacon is really tasty so is there sausage. My daughter loves her pancakes. My husband liked his steak an eggs. But the best plate in our group was by far the chicken and biscuits. It's chicken, eggs (however you like them) biscuits, bacon gravy, with green onions on top... Sooooo good. I usually only go to Saddle Ranch for drinks but I will be eating chicken and biscuits from there soon. A couple bites from my neice wasn't nearly enough.",

Luckily she had a hostess on duty who actually cared about the customers and was able to make it work. Managers attitude was horrible every time I witnessed it. Yelling in her mouthpiece to employees in front of customers. I would give this place 1 star for the manager alone. But the hostess was great and our waitress Amanda was on top of it,even when it did get extremely busy.",

    "text": "We decided to try Saddle Ranch yesterday(Sunday May, 24th) with some friends who had been there before and said the food is good.  We arrived about 5:15.  There were 7 of us(4 adults, 3 children).  We went up to the hostess station, and told them there we had 7 people.  This is where it all started to unravel...I'm thinking 7 must be an unlucky number for this establishment, or they never had a party of 7 show up before, or they were just that unorganized and incompetent.    We were asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside, we chose inside.  after about 5 minutes of looking around, staring at each other, and trying to figure out what to do; they managed to find us a table by the bull ring.  This shouldn't have been a tough thing to accomplish; the restaurant was 80-90% empty(with this level of incompetence I could see why).  Well, with all the empty tables in the place, they sit us next to the loud, obnoxious, drunk table shared by 2 couples who thought it was okay to cuss like sailors in front of small kids.  Back to the hostess stand we go(only about 25 feet away).  We tell them the problem, and ask for another table.  Once again we are asked if we would like to sit outside, our answer is still the same, no.  Well, they claimed they couldn't seat us inside because they had reservations and all the other tables inside were reserved.  I found this hard to believe, since the place was almost empty, and there were 3-4 staff just milling around at the hostess station.  One staff member(manager?) did offer to go over to the table and ask those patrons to watch there language, but would not seat us at another indoor table.  We declined, for obvious reasons.  I did notice the General Manager and the Head Chef had their names on the door of the restaurant, and I wish i would have either taken a photo or copied down the names so I could contact them directly.  My guess is that some serious training/re-training needs to occur if this restaurant will remain in business at this location.  I understand that people come to a bar/restaurant to drink and have a good time.  I also understand that some people don't care how they act and don't care who's around when they have been drinking.  I do think that either a hostess, or manager would have the common sense not to sit 2 families with children next to a bunch of drunken louts in a restaurant that is 80-90% empty.    Hint to management, don't turn down 7 paying customers that walk in to an almost empty restaurant because you claim to have \"reservations\" for every other table in the restaurant.  Keep the customer that is already there, and let them have another table.  By the time all the customers with reservations show up, the drunks should either be gone or maybe passed out.  I will add, that we went to another restaurant in Westgate, and when we walked back by Saddle Ranch, they were not that much busier than they were an hour before.  This has to be the most incompetent group of employees at any restaurant in Arizona.",

    "text": "I am a waiter and was dining with other waiters, so usually we are pretty understanding when servers are busy. But this was on another level. I would give this establishment 0 stars if I could. First, our waiter didn't greet our table for 15 minutes. Then it took an additional 15 minutes just to get our drinks. They were fountain drinks too, not bar drinks. She forgot to bring us waters, we got our appetizer before our drinks and they came without plates or napkins. Then after we finished our appetizer, they dropped our check and we had to write the tip in before the food even got to us. They also asked for a credit care at the very first greet to start a tab which we though was really odd. For our dinner, which took quite a while to get delivered, Me, my cousin and her husband all ordered the same exact thing and mine was the only one that came correctly. We ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich without any modifications and my cousins came with no lettuce, onion and tomato, and her husbands came without bacon or a pickle. They were also very cold and clearly had been sitting in the window for quite some time. My niece ordered a kids mac and cheese with fruit and ate her fruit first. She's a really slow eater and took her first bite of mac and cheese after it had been sitting on the table for at least 10 minutes. Upon taking her first bite, she burst into tears because her pasta was so hot. She spit it out into a napkin and then we dumped it out to let it out onto a plate to let it cool off and it was steaming soooooo much. My 5 year old niece was in tears for most of our meal because she burnt herself so badly. She was scared to even eat one bite of the pasta after that. The managers also knew we were frustrated, and didn't do anything to remedy the situation. They didn't apologize, take anything off the check, even acknowledge the terrible service we were receiving. Nothing. We will never be dining at saddle ranch again. Adult food came out cold as ice and kids came out so hot she was sobbing. Are you serious? Our waitress was clearly far in the weeds, but regardless, the service we received was unacceptable.",

We all had steak - which we all enjoyed, even my very picky father who refuses to eat in any kind of \"chain\" restaurant.  The service was decent as well but go early as this place does get crowded. (We ate the night before at Margaritaville also at Westgate)  Finding a decent place while on vacation can be a difficult task at times but we did well with this place (being from Chicago)  It's a decent place to grab a decent dinner or go for drinks and get entertained by those riding the mechanical bull :)",
