    "text": "You can never go wrong with dining at Ruth's Chris! I was already a fan of this restaurant chain but wanted to dine at their Scottsdale location to see what it was like.. This restaurant is located upstairs in a mid-sized plaza.. The decor and ambiance are great but there isn't an amazing view like you would find at other Ruth's Chris'.. The wait staff are extremely friendly and the service was top quality.. I had their maryland blue crab cake appetizer, an apple martini, and their porterhouse for two entree.. Everything tasted amazing and I wouldn't have ordered anything else.. My only critique is that we ordered the porterhouse medium rare and the larger pieces were completely rare in the middle.. Luckily they serve their meat on sizzling hot plates so I was able to cook my meat a bit more.. The drinks here are served very strong so if you're not a big fan of that then I suggest asking them to tone it down a bit.. I didn't order anything for dessert because nothing on the menu appealed to me but I enjoyed what I did eat.. If you're looking for a special place to take someone out on a date then I recommend Ruth's Chris!",

I was super excited in the month leading up to Valentine's day so he called to confirm our reservation a few days before. When he called, he was told they didn't have a record of his reservation. Since Ruth's Chris is an upscale restaurant he assumed he wouldn't need to get the girl's name he made the reservation with and when he spoke with the manager he basically told him he was out of luck because he had didn't have the name of the girl he made the reservation with. I have been to Ruth's Chris many times in the past, but after this experience, I will not be going back. I understand mistakes being made, but you'd think with this type of a restaurant they would have  a more efficient way to track reservations. We ended up having a great Valentine's day and he was able to get a reservation at a much better steak place (cooler atmosphere, better food and he received an email confirmation of our reservation with a reservation number!)",

By this I mean, the service, the presentation, the food, the atmosphere. The staff knows that when you walk in, you will be spending good money and they expect to take care of your whim and cater to your palette.  The steaks are buttery, delicious and worth every bite. The sommelier made a wonderful suggestion to go with our order and he was spot on in his selection. This may not be the place to dine on a regular basis for some, but if you plan to make a special night of an occasion, I recommend highly Ruth's Chris. I have not been to the one in Phoenix, only the Scottsdale location, but I would be hard pressed to say that it would be any less tasty.  My buddy was treated so kindly and his comment (paraphrased) was as follows: It's too bad that so much of the world hates Americans. They think that Americans are so loud and bossy. They can be so kind and so willing to to be helpful when they want. In Europe, no one cares if you are from France or Italy or Dernmark because we are like states next to each other. In America, everyone wants to know about where you are from and want to hear you talk about it and the places you have been.  Thank you to the staff for being a part of my friend's visit.",

The steak came well done, then it was returned rare - finally it was cooked medium, and the cook personally comped it, which was nice because then the gift cert covered the meal with a decent tip. Get the picture? Also, the lobster was tough. The ambience is ok but crowded, and unless you have a gift certificate or too much money, I can't think of a good reason to burn money here. You can get a comparable steak-lobster combo at a number of other venues at 1/2 to 1/3 the cost.",

Our waiter was very quick to start out drink orders and see if we had any questions about the menu. They were properly staffed so much that we were able to have an in depth conversation with our waiter which was nice.    You will find the menu to contain the typical steakhouse entrees and sides. The steaks are great and always perfectly cooked how you order them. As far as the seafood the lobster tails were amazing not overcooked. I recommend the lobster mac and cheese, or the sweet potato casserole as sides  Overall I had a great experience here like always.",

From the hostess who seems annoyed upon arrival to the waitress who takes your order and the servers who bring your food they all deserve 0 stars.

Two others at our table ordered the prime rib burger-same problem served WELL not medium as we ordered. I didn't want to complain as it was a graduation celebration and no need for negative vibes.

It's a company owned store who features the outrageous banana cream pie specialty desert, which many other stores discontinued because it's too time consuming to make. The food is exceptional, included during happy hour. Whether you're in the mood for a prime steak, creamed spinach and au gratin potatoes or a prime cheeseburger with hand cut fries, you will not be disappointed. But really what goes beyond the food and the atmosphere, is the service. One server is better than the next. Each is professional, courteous, and just like their prime steaks - fabulous. I'd highly recommend this Ruth's Chris to anyone. It's a shining example of how restaurants should treat their customers.",

I realize I expect  a lot compared to the average patron. So a little disappointed to rate this st only three stars.. First I stopped in about 5 as I am traveling off east coast  and while the bar was full hostess rest of house was empty .. as I ask for 1 the hostess said st least an hour for the bar did not even suggest a table.. so said I would try latter ... so returned about an hour latter and just told them  party of one they said well it would be 8:00pm .   Just told them would wait and just felt they were annoyed.. first time out of probably 60 it 70 visits over the years I did not fill welcomed.. ( this was my first trip to the Scottsdale Ruth Chris) wanted about 3o minutes and a bar table opened up. I noticed a party of 3 came in without a reservation and was seated almost immediately ..so had to assume they were busy and really did not want to waste a space on a single .. even that this single travels over 150 nights a year for many years eat alone often. Beside this the server was great. The steak was cooked perfectly but the quality seemed not up to normal Ruth Chris I expected. The real letdown was the garlic mash potatoes ... basically a ripoff Luke warm   No garlic  and almost grainy like out of a box .. not $11 dollar side. Normally don't do the mash at RC but just in the mood and expected a lot more quality for the $.   So probably my most disappointment ever with a Ruth Chris.",

    "text": "Stopped in yesterday for the promotional happy hour menu which runs from 4:30-6:30 in the bar only.  Some of the menu items featured are a filet mignon sandwich and an angus burger as well as some fried shrimp and a few other items food wise. There are also artisinal cocktails and such and everything is $9.  The quality of the filet mignon sandwich is unmatched and is a generous portion of meat served on garlic toast with some french fries (the french fries are uninspired and average, but can be looked past in favor of the quality level of the sandwich)  One thing I will say is the service is not the best, our waiter was very lax in bringing us refills on our beverages and was also very slow in bringing the food to the bar top table we were sitting at, I had the suspicious feeling the food was done for a while and then brought to the table as the fries were soggy and the sandwich not as hot as it could have been.  My BIGGEST complaint and something completely unacceptable was that I ordered a salad and it was not brought out first but rather brought out with my entree, at an upscale place like this you expect them to at least get that right.   To sum my experience up it was worth the low cost of the bar menu, however don't expect the same service someone at a table ordering a $50 steak might get.",

My husband prefers his steaks well done...with ketchup (YES, I know....) and never do they make him feel funny about it and they ALWAYS cook it perfectly. Our last visit I had the chilean sea bass. That is a fish that is so easy to overcook and mine was PERFECT.  The salads are always served chilled and the hot dishes are always always hot.   Can't go wrong with the potatoes au gratin though any one of the side dishes will do because they are all yum. Desserts are also delicious but usually we are so full from dinner that we just can't make dessert work.   The staff is attentive, friendly and pleasant without being overbearing. That's a biggie for me. Some servers just want to be besties and I just want to eat....  Definitely recommend this location and be sure to set a reservation or it'll be a long wait!",

We booked our friday dinner at least 4 months back only to find out a week before it had been cancelled. Could it be they never advertised a Friday dinner? Tonight by far was the worst service we have ever received. Food n drinks were great as always. First round of drinks. One person on our table gets a drink 5 mins later 2nd person. 5 mins later the next 2 people. This goes on for each and every drink and course. 3rd course we never received. We had to request our course. 4th course the server spilled a full glass of water on the person across from me. He said I hope th fob works for the car. They did remove the steak from his tab. For the money it cost to attend thess dinners this will be our last until they get better organized. OMG!!!",

    "text": "We had dinner at Ruth's on Sunday, August 2nd with a party of 5, four adults and one child. Our waiter was very polite but four of our steaks were not prepared properly. The waiter did check back with us as we each realized our steaks weren't prepared as ordered. At this point it is difficult as all four were over-done. If they were a bit under-done they could be put back on for a few minutes, however all four were over cooked. With one of us with the correct order and the side orders being shared, we all kept our meals as we didn't want to make a huge issue. It was my 80 year old mother's treat for the birthday celebration and not worth making a big deal over, waiting another 10-15 minutes while they were re-made and having her feel bad. Pretty unforgivable and disappointing having four steaks out of five over-cooked.  : (",

The restaurant itself is set up upstairs with a seating, bar, and patio area. The atmosphere is very romantic and peaceful. Outside you have a nice view of the sunset and inside the ambiance is very relaxing. Each employee was very courteous and respectful. I loved our waiter the most!!! We were out celebrating my birthday and he brought over a little baggy that was filled with little pieces of confetti and spread it around our table to make it a little more \"birthday festive\" for me. Each person who came to our table wished me a happy birthday; it was very sweet that they went out of their way to make the occasion a little more special. The food was moist, hot, and above all nothing short of perfect! The chicken I ordered was basically injected with heaven, I cant describe it any other way! My taste buds went bananas! The combination of the atmosphere, the staff, the food and the company I was dining with, the evening was fantastic! Last but not least our waiter surprised me with a free piece of their delicious chocolate cake with Happy Birthday writing. My boyfriend didn't even have to ask (Like most restaurants) they just brought it out automatically after dinner! No singing, so other guest weren't disturbed, just a Happy Birthday note with cake, it was awesome! I will definitely be going back as soon as I can (im going to start celebrating my birthday every month! HAHA!) I will be recommending it to all my family and friends! Ruth Chris keep it up!!!",

The steak managed to remain fairly juicy, so I didn't not request to send it back. My wife had the filet, and hers was also slightly overdone.  The sides were perfection though. The Honey and bacon roasted brussel sprouts were amazing. The lyonnaise and rosemary herbed fingerling roasted potatoes were to die for.  And desert was delish as well. I had the White Chocolate bread pudding. Its not quite as amazing as another establishments \"Butter Cake\"..but it was still delish!  Overall, not bad.  Ruth's Chis will remain in our rotation.",

    "text": "Update:  December 23, 2016:  Had a wonderful dinner of Ahi-tuna, BBQ shrimp and sea bass. The new discovery----- apple crumble cheese cake with Haagen Das ice cream.  Really good!    Lovely setting as usual.  We were given a booth that could have accommodated more people so they were very nice.  Here's the rundown. Delicious crusty bread with butter.  We had seconds (it was so good).  Spicy Bloody Mary with plenty of horseradish-- good drink with enough alcohol.  Sometimes drinks don't have enough alcohol at certain establishments, but this one was great.    We had the mozzarella and kumato tomato appetizer with basil and balsamic drizzle.  I looked forward to kumato tomatoes because they are truly delicious.  This appetizer did not live up to our expectations.  The mozzarella was not that good (cut up in cubes)  and the kumato tomatoes were nothing special.  We were very disappointed and would not order this again.    The sea bass we ordered was perfection.  A thick, flaky piece of fish sitting on minute pieces of sweet potato and pineapple.  When we saw sweet potato on the menu with the sea bass, we assumed we would not have to order a side.  But there wasn't enough sweet potato so we should have ordered one side- maybe a veggie.    The Barbecue Shrimp came with 10 medium sized shrimp.  This dish was described as having garlic mashed potatoes.  This dish was mostly shrimp and sauce and the mashed potatoes was almost nonexistent.  Keep in mind that I have had this dish many times before and it had enough mashed potatoes to mix nicely with the delicious sauce.  Not this one.  I should have said something but didn't.    For dessert, we had the chocolate mousse combo-- a chocolate lava cake along with a mini-cup of chocolate mousse. The lava cake was very good but the chocolate mousse was NOT.  The mousse was not dark enough--as if the mousse was made with milk chocolate (not dark, bitter chocolate) or that is was cut with whipped cream. The taste was not good.  We like our chocolate mousse dark and rich and this was not it.    Our service with BEN was attentive and the manager came by twice to make sure everything was good.  I like the service at Ruth Chris as they make you feel special.    Despite 3 disappointments during this meal, I still think they warrant 4 stars for service and the food that was enjoyed.",

Came on Halloween night, it was pretty dead which was nice! Their outside patio is AWESOME and we sat out there because the weather was so nice.   We ordered the ahi tuna, calamari and shrimp as apps. Everyone said they were real good especially the tuna.   For dinner, we ordered two 11oz filets, bone in filet, ribeye and fish. My filet was the only problem child - it was covered in fat and I KNOW better to ask for a center cut from Ruth's. Waitress was super understanding. Also, our shoestring fries were super cold, so got a redo on those as well. My filet came back out and was perfectly cooked and center cut (yessssss).   Overall, we had a nice dinner with the family. Had to kick down a star due to the screw ups on food and we had to ask them to remove the filet off the bill.   Definitely will come back!",

This last time, we had a young guy who made great conversation and recommendations of wine/prosecco. It has a dark ambiance, like many steakhouses with dark wood walls. I love the classic look. I also prefer to sit at the booths they are comfy.   We had the calamari to start. I've never had a calamari dish that was sweet but also spicy. The breading did not come off and it was not chewy.  For my dish I had the filet mignon with shrimp on top. The only complaint I have (which is like nothing) is the temperature of the shrimp, it was not as hot as I would want it, it didn't match the heat of the filet mignon. Any way, I enjoyed this with mash potatoes. My bf had the ribeye with creamed spinach. We shared the sides and they were absolutely perfect as always. We also had the sweet potatoe side-you have to get this! It's amazing.  I will keep visiting this location, it never disappoints.",

The filet was tender, but not the best I've had. The sweep potato casserole was tasty. The crab cakes were good.  2 - I paid $120 for me and my girlfriend. At a price like this, I assume that the food is going to be good, and my question is always, \"How much better is this food than my $9 meal at Chipotle?\" Was it $120 good? I don't know... I would probably go back but not very often.  3 - The service was fine. But I didn't notice anything special or unusual about it, as it has been described in some of the other raving reviews on this site.  4 - The combo, where you get a starter, side, main dish, and dessert, for $53, is not worth it. It would be a great deal if you could choose any starter, side, or dessert. But the options that they allow with the combo are lame -- they don't include any of their good sides or starters. You're better off a la carte.",

We ordered three filet mignon plates, 11oz. size, and all three of them had huge pieces of fat attached to them. I would say about 20% of the filet was a chunk of fat. That should never be the case with a filet in any decent restaurant. A filet mignon should be so clean that not a single piece remains on the plate, nothing more to say. Go to Mastros and this would never happen. Yes they are more expensive, but you get what you pay for, a 100% edible piece of high quality meat.  The appetizers were good, the dessert was also good, but the steak, they key piece of the meal was disappointing. I will say that when I complained they did recognize that I was correct and took one entire steak off the bill to compensate. Great service and attention, but very poor quality control on the cut of meat out of the kitchen. I would hesitate to go back in fear of the same experience.",

I was given a number of gift cards over the last couple years and used each one.  I now ask that I NOT be given anything to do with this restaurant..  Here are the reasons:  1.  Confirmed reservations were ignored or not honored.  The final visit resulted in an hour wait.  Yea that was a great anniversary visit waiting at the bar. 2.  The staff is uniformly ignorant about customer service.  Is it so hard to take less than 30 minutes to come and take the order?  Can you come back sometime again during the meal?  Why do I wait another half hour to be asked if I want coffee and dessert once my plate is removed? Does each visit really have to take 2 and a half hours? I exempt the bus staff as they tried. 3.  The food is ordinary...no comparison to The Capital Grille or others. 4.  Each and every time we had such bad service we were given free desserts.  They clearly understood that our experience was bad.  Please FIX 1, 2,& 3 above.  I don't care about the dessert if the rest of my experience is so awful.  After the last time I have stopped going and will not be back.  There are other places that give you great value for your time and money so take the opportunity and go elsewhere.  Scottsdale has Atlas Bistro and Monarch Cafe that can rock your socks off.",

    "text": "This was my second trip to Ruth's Chris. I absolutely love coming here it is always a great experience.   First the ambiance; The restaurant is very beautiful and clean :) You walk into a hostess area where they great you and refer to you by last name. They are quick and efficient. The tables have table clothes and cloth napkins. The bathrooms are in tip top shape as well, with a full length mirror to adjust your nice clothes you are asked to wear.  The service; We were seated by a hostess who immediately noticed my date and I were wearing black. When were seated she replaced our white napkins with black ones so we did not have lint on our clothes. I thought that was the most generous thing. It seems small but it was awesome that they even thought of something like that. They cleared off the other two settings and we were brought out bread and water. Our waiter was kind and efficient. I ordered iced tea and I use sweet n low in it. The cup of sweeteners was low on sweet n low but I only use 1 per glass so I was not ready to ask for more. When he brought me a refill, in a new glass not filled at my table, he replaced the sweetener bowl with another full of sweet n low. I didn't even have to ask for more he had already noticed. The attention to detail was so impressive.   The food; The food is outstanding. I ordered the stuffed chicken on both of m visits and I like to refer to it as \"chicken stuffed full of heaven\". The dishes come out nice and hot as well as separate sides. If you want to share a side it is completely possible, they bring you out a boat of mashed potato's!! I try not to eat too much bread and salad because I want to eat my entire main course :) My date had a steak which was delicious as well. It was cooked perfectly and was nice and warm the entire meal.  The price; You will notice that this is not a cheap restaurant. The experience and the food is worth every penny. I am a strong believer that if you are paying a high price the food and the service should be impeccable, and it was.   I love coming to Ruth's Chris. The price is a little high so I do not get to endulge as much as I would like but I make it worth it each time I am able to go!!",

The four course meal included: balsamic vinaigrette salad, your choice of: petite filet, chicken and or fish and garlic mashed potatoes, creamy spinach and for desert: toasted coconut-pineapple-creme brulee-bread pudding and a side of dark chocolate with macadamia nuts and toasted coconut. I absolutely LOVED their filet mignon. It was excellent medium-rare.  A special thank you to NAHN and Bayer for sponsoring. We had the event in their private area that was secluded with partition sliding doors, it was very comfortable and nicely decorated. I wouldn't mind returning for future events and of course the filet mignon! :)",

When the food is already top notch, the level do customer service simply makes for a delightful evening.  The steaks are delivered to the table sizzling hot in a shallow bath of buttery juice.  They are tender & tasty.  The side dishes are generous in their proportions.  The only negative (and this is purely personal) is that the Blu cheese dressing consists of a heaping of the crumbles and little to no creamy dressing.  (Again, this is only personal but I prefer the creamy aspects in a dressing). Next time I will choose the chopped salad!",

    "text": "I frequent RCSH and this one was right down the middle. Enjoyed the experience. Mr Muscle had not been to one - and he loved it. Started with shrimp cocktail. HUGE, ice cold (a must) and delicious, slightly spicy cocktail sauce ($16 for 4). We were sat at a table near the bar, not cool but didn't feel like pushing the subject, it is also across from the waiters station which is right out in the open (which means I have to hear all about their escapades from the night before.. like dude, like dude...blah blah) . If you are going for a big night, don't accept this table. Our waiter was Francisco and we got off slightly on the wrong foot because he is having to push the brand - maybe due to the 50th anniversary but it was uncomfortable - the history and stats on RCSH - not so much.  He quickly and completely redeemed himself by pointing out the 'Favorites Menu\" thereby shaving $50 dollars off our bill.  He was extremely helpful and having dined at Ruths Chris not less than 5 times in the last 60 days, he was the ONLY one to mention the substitutions and upcharges - he was a winner. Filet (medium rare) and the ribeye (medium) were perfect and delicious - Mr Muscle said it was in the top 5 steaks of all time. Standard baked potato and broccoli au gratin. All good. Only disappointment was the house salad. Completely warm mixed greens and wilted - totally bummed it out as this is one of the highlights for me. Love their house salad with blue cheese. They should not have served that lettuce. Period. Otherwise, kudos to Franisco (we used the money he saved us to tip him a bit more -!! ) and a delicious steak. You can never go wrong with Ruths Chris",

My lobster mac and cheese was great as well, the slight kick of peppers with the taste of fresh cold water lobster goes perfectly together.

We had the crab stuffed mushrooms to start with they were delicious followed by two filets and Au gratin potatoes for dinner. Like I said, the food was 10/10 and deserves five stars. The reason I gave this place 2 stars is because of what happened when I paid the bill. I gave our waiter cash and asked for change back. My boyfriend and I are both servers and understand how to tip I was planning on giving our waiter 20% as we were both very happy with our food and service up until this point. Our waiter to my surprise came back with our change minus his 20% tip. Yes that is right our waiter felt it was his responsibility to decide what tip he received. As a fellow server, I understand he was probably profiling us assuming we weren't going to tip well as young adults. However, that action pissed me off so much and makes me question if I will ever dine at this establishment again.",

    "text": "This was my first time eating at a Ruth's Chris restaurant and even though I was reasonably happy with my food, the overall experience did not live up to my expectations. It was a good meal but not worth the money. Our total bill for two (including drinks, tax, and tip) was $200 and I think we could have had basically the same meal at The Keg or Flemings for half of that cost. Or, for equal money gone to a much swankier place like J&G or Capital Grille and had a really pampered experience and more impressive meal.  Coming up the elevator and entering the dining room, I was surprised that it was such a casual environment.  It could have been any family restaurant in a strip mall. I did not get an upscale steakhouse vibe at all. We were seated in a four-top in the center aisle and my chair got bumped several times by both servers and patrons. At some point one of them knocked my clutch purse off the table and then stepped on it which I didn't realize until much later. I have been to places (esp in NYC) where they crammed a lot more tables into a small space but there was something about the layout of Ruth's Chris that was just really awkward and uncomfortable. I am sure if you sat in a booth you wouldn't have this problem but you still would have to put up with the lackluster decor and barely there background music. Another thing that made me uneasy was that there was some woman (the manager?) standing not more from 10 feet from me staring intently into the dining room for the entire meal. Occasionally she would bark orders at the servers but I never saw her walk around and talk to any of the guests.  As for the food, we started with the calamari appetizer. It was cooked adequately, though a little too much breading for my taste, but the sauce it came with was amazing! It was like a sweet chili sauce and I could have drank a whole bottle of it. The only misstep was that they should have served it on the side rather than drizzling it on top since it made the breading get soggy. They brought out our salads before we had finished with the appetizer. This is a pet peeve of mine since I feel that when the pacing of courses is off it can really ruin the entire meal. But we both loved our salads; I had the Harvest Salad which was full of flavor and the hubby had his usual Caesar and he thought this was one of the best he'd had in a while. It had big chunks of shaved Parmesan in it which was cool. He ordered the cowboy ribeye and was pretty happy but he typically does like his steak unadorned with no condiments. Personally, I would have appreciated some seasoning besides butter on my petite fillet. As others have mentioned, both steaks came out cooked a little more than we had asked for but I think that is likely due to the super hot plates that keep the meat cooking after they are brought to the table. The odd thing was that the bleu cheese \"crust\" was really just bread crumbs and cheese crumbles spooned on top. It was not melted or seared in as I was expecting. I don't mind a well done steak so I enjoyed it but the lobster tail was a big disappointment. It too was a tad overcooked, but not so bad that it was inedible. However, the meat was extremely flavorless. Maybe it is because I am used to Maine lobster? Or maybe it was not fresh? One thing is for sure, the blackening spices mentioned in the description were no where to be found. It was an extremly bland entree. The highlight of the meal was probably the mashed potatoes we shared which were delicious! No complaints there. We finished our meals with dessert and coffee. I ate the chocolate and caramel cake that came with the Ruth's Classics meal. It was good, but had that fresh-from-the-fridge taste. The hubby ordered the caramelized banana cream pie and even though he didn't like the super hard pie crust (this dish also had been in the fridge way too long) he did like the flavor of the banana pudding center. We both had two drinks each, he had beer and I had martinis and we were surprised to see how pricey those were. I don't mind paying $12-14 for a specialty drink but I have never paid that for a basic gin martini. Also I specifically asked for the bleu cheese stuffed olives but these were forgotten on the first round.  Our waiter was a friendly and funny guy but as the other reviewers have mentioned, there was a little bit of rushing us along while ordering and also some nudges to up sell at various points. Overall, it was the same service I would expect at an Outback or someplace similar but just not to the level of this price point. Which is basically what I would say about the food and whole experience. I wouldn't refuse to eat here again because I think you could have a more economical meal if you skipped the drinks and ordered the Ruth's Classics complete meal which is starter, entree, side, and dessert for only $42.95. But this place is not worth spending more than that so I wouldn't recommend it when there are so many better steakhouses in town.",

We both had the Ribeye 12 ounce steak which by the way was the BEST Ribeye I have ever had. Mashed potatoes which complimented our entree and a few glasses of red wine.

Lovely ambience and a menu that cannot be beat. The price is ridiculous ($52 for a cowboy rib-eye) but absolutely delicious. The steaks are amazingly prepared and the sides are served family style. We tried three different salads and they were all good. We shared the lyonnaise potatoes, which were cooked to crispy perfection and the steamed asparagus with hollandaise. Good hollandaise too. We skipped out on dessert this time and shared a little wine instead. Lovely, perfect, delicious.",

    "text": "I will say Ruth's Chris is consistent when providing quality food and service. We live in Newport Beach so Irvine is the location we frequent most but have been to Phoenix, Palm Springs, Beverly Hills, Pasadena, Woodland Hills, Kona, Maui, and Oahu.   My husband and I always bring our own wine, share an appetizer, share a salad and share a filet (always juicy and tender) along with the au gratin potatoes. Sometimes we get dessert (banana creme pie yum!) sometimes not but our bill is rarely over $100.00 before tip.  We've been to Flemings and I am convinced they are more expensive and the food is not as good, the last time we went there in Newport they sat us downstairs in a dungeon like room, to which I said \"uh no\".  IMO you must dine at a Ruth's Chris before you die and judge for yourself, the portions are huge so you can share and still leave feeling stuffed.    Bon appetite!",

He got a Ribeye which was good, but not the best he has had.  I got the one and only fish entree and it was mediocre.  I've had better at Outback!   The appetizer was nice, but the sides were awful.  Gross cheese covered crunchy potatoes that we left behind, and very plain grilled asparagus.  Not seasoned and there were maybe ten pieces.  Probably two dollars each!  They were nice and brought a small dessert for his birthday, but then offered a complementary picture which never happened because they never came.  The meal was $200 and we were disappointed, need I say more?",

I made the mistake of using my knife upside down on my first bite (so much excitement), but it didn't matter because the meat was ssssoooo tender. We so enjoyed a red wine with our meal, cab and malbec. Both were quite tasty, I would consider buying a bottle for home. We both ordered the garlic mashed potatoes, also delicious. Dessert, the mini sin cake and classic cheesecake. The cake was super rich but yummy. The cheesecake was light, cool and refreshing, I recommend the cheesecake.

She ordered the sea bass as her main entree and I ordered the $68.00 bone-in filet medium rare. Our waiter informed me that it would be served very pink on the inside. Told him that's exactly how I wanted. The steak was delivered to our table medium to medium-well. Our waiter could not apologize enough.  Advise him that it wasn't his fault he's not back in the kitchen doing the cooking. Offered to replace the steak with another. If they can't cook it right the 1st time I don't have much confidence they'll be able to do it the 2nd either! This is the 2nd time this has happened to me at Ruth Chris's. When you're paying almost $70 for a steak from a restaurant who suppose to specialize in steaks and the kitchen is not able to cook it to the customers request maybe they need to get out of the steak business and specialize in Seafood.

Needless to say given our stellar experience at their New Orleans location we were expecting great service and excellent food, unfortunately neither of those were met.   To start, when we walked in both hostesses had their heads down looking at their screens, neither acknowledged our presence. After standing there for a minute the hostess on my right finally looked up, not saying a word just stared at me, at which point I said \"reservation for Ryan\" and all I got was \"last name\". I was then informed it would be a minute, no hello, no thank you, no please wait a moment, just \"it will be a few minutes\". Amazing.   We were seated in what seemed like the loudest room possible, directly in the center of the dining room, literally the opposite of the quiet table I asked for. Our server came to take our drink order (she was wonderful by the way, the only reason you even get a star, other than the fact I can't leave zero). The drinks were excellent, exactly as we remember (one of their signature cocktails we actually love is the coconut ginger lemon drop martini).   While waiting for our food, which took an exceptionally long time, one of the waiters for another tables dropped and a tray of food directly on my chair. Thankfully none got on me or the cushion, although it startled the hell out of me and 500 degree plates could have burned quite a bit....  The food finally came, the steak was good, the sides were exceptionally smaller than we remember. We normally order one each and split them, there really wasn't enough to do that. When we would dine in New Orleans we would always have leftovers.   My fiance had some leftover steak to take home, which was oddly placed in a bread bag, not the traditional to go bag. Small I know, but just one more oddity to the night that has us never wanting to return.   All in all extremely disappointing, which is a shame. We had such wonderful experiences with Ruth Chris in New Orleans, it's honesty hard to write this review. I think management really needs to address some staff quality issues here, they are abundant.",

It was a large group of about 7 and we made it clear that we were celebrating our anniversary and wanted quiet and private dining. We were ignored. We were seated by an entrance and throughout the meal we had 2 bussers behind us in the hallway talking loudly in spanish without consideration to those around them. Our waiter was clearly unhappy, could not reccomend anything, had zero personality and did not offer any more that we asked for. The food was not great but not bad and there was nothing special on the menu. Nothing unique. When we left we were not impressed. We will probably not go back.",

I ordered the Chillean Sea Bass with a side of shrimp which were very tasty. They were richly soaked in butter and had a lemon juice on them as well. Both items were delicious. The service was a little bit slow, and the prices are very hefty for the quality. The sides are good too, but pricy. Our server also somewhat deceived us by offering us sides in a way that seemed like our entrees came with a side, and he offered us sides. We ordered the sides and they added up on the bill largely, not a classy move by the server. Other than that it was good. This was a very nice location, as I have been to many other of these restaraunts and this is the best set up one I have seen yet. Overall I would recommend, but only if you are willing to spend a good chunk of cash.",

It took a while to get refills and several times we had to ask for them. The steaks were well cooked and flavored as were the sides.

    "text": "Perfection.  You know when you're flying, in an airplane, and you're thumbing thru the airlines magazine and you come across the ad w/ the picture of the perfect filet mignon?  That's Ruth Christ Steakhouse.  Our family has been looking for the perfect filet mignon and found it about 10 years ago here, at Ruth Chris.  So we've been coming here annually for my dad's birthday, also Christmas Eve, ever since.  Perfect meal includes, Appetizer: BBQ shrimp, in a buttery white wine, semi-spicy sauce that will have you licking the plate, or at least asking for more bread to help you look a little more dignified. Salad: Wedge, with perfect crispness iceberg lettuce and a chunky blue cheese. Soup: Lobster Bisque, buttery goodness.  Meal: Filet Mignon medium. Sides: Mashed potatoes perfectly whipped and topped with butter and if it's the holiday time the sweet potatoes casserole is so tempting.  Desert: Creme Brule comes with berries and is the perfect consistency once broken thru hard candied layer.  Now, I will not eat all of that.  I've had all of these, and more, but will only be able to go thru a portion of what's above.  My eyes are way bigger than my stomach at this place.  It's come to where I won't even open the menu as I'm afraid I will drift away from what I usually get and order too much.  This is a long review for me, I'm usually to the point, but there is so much to share about this place.  Mainly the food but not to go unmentioned: the service, spectacular, the wine list, pricey but a wonderful selection and the ambiance, upscale without being too froufrou.  I'm a big fan.",

I ordered lamb chops thinking I cook steak at home all the time, they were cooked to perfection, but lacking in flavor....boring actually (surprisingly so).  I  also tasted the Fillet Mignon  and Porter House steaks, and they were same... just average in flavor. All entrees  are a la carte, that's ok, but the presentation on the plate lacked all color  (I know you can't eat color, but other steakhouses seem to present a la carte plates without this feeling of nakedness).    Not to date myself too badly here but In fact the whole thing reminded me of a an upscale (in it's prime) steakhouse circa 1975; not in a classic vogue way but in a \"this needs an update\" way.  You could go to OutBack Steakhouse and have a better meal for 1/4 the price. Not what I was expecting.  All in all... I don't think you get your bang for the buck but nothing was horribly wrong per se.",

I decided to take my friend there for his birthday and \"check it out\". I chose the location on Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale AZ. I'd made a reservation and when I realized we'd be late, I called to let them know.   Here's where my experience began: I was surprised with their response - they were courteous and encouraged me to come regardless of how late we would be since they were open until 10pm. As long as we arrived by 10pm, they would be happy to serve us.   Wow! That's different, I thought...  We arrived - at 9:45pm - and we were greeted warmly and welcomed enthusiastically.  There was no one else in the dining area, so it was more like a private dinner. The Hostess seated us at the table of our choice and was conversational without monopolizing our time. She was professional and very friendly. Our server came to the table and when my birthday guest apologized for our tardiness, he was told that it was no problem at all. \"The important thing is that you have a wonderful birthday and enjoy yourself. We are here for you tonight.\" YES, that is what he said AND his attitude and actions backed up his words.  Wow - Again!!  Our whole evening was wonderful.  What I want to say is that my experience at Ruth's Chris Steak House was, by far, the best I've ever had at a steak house. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was excellent. The steak practically melted in our mouths and the shrimp was superb.   I highly recommend this steak house to anyone desiring to have a relaxed evening with delicious food and excellent friendly service.  I look forward to my next visit...",

Prove to the customer you're trying to woo that you have a big enough per'diem to cover an expensive bottle of wine and fine piece of cow. But that's ok. At this Ruth's Chris, you'll actually get a really nice bit of cow. My suggestion to you is to waive off the petitie filet mignon. I mean really? Your mother wouldn't even order something that starts with 'petite' and she's 4'9\". Go for the Ribeye. It's the most succulent, tasty morsel on the cow and for the love of everything that is good in this world, don't get a crust on it. Just stop with the blue-cheese crusts already. Want blue cheese? Get a Wedge Salad. Lovely. Trust me on the Ribeye. It will ruin you for other bits of cow.",

I ordered the Chefs Special which was the BLT salad, filet mijon with shrimp, and green beans for the side. I didn't know I was hungry, but I finished every bite.  The cucumber ranch dressing that came with the salad was so amazing, creamy, and fresh!  We had plenty of left overs that were packed up for another amazing dinner tomorrow.  Thank you Todd for making our evening very special!",

My wife could not eat her half. Complained to the Maitre d' who told us that's what makes the steak good. Then he said I received the portion my wife should have gotten and then  promptly disappeared for the evening. On the positive side the side dishes were excellent. The wine was top notch and the bartender was wonderful. However we didn't go there to drink and have mushrooms and mash potatoes. A very disappointing evening overall and we will not return to this restaurant.  Michael G",

Food was good as always and the only glitch I remember is that the desert hubby ordered was tiny, and was a lot of chocolate, which was not in the name or description I think because he does not like chocolate.

Unfortunately for us and the rest of the small room, we were next to a couple who was racist (\"our server is Mexican and doesn't understand us\") and every of their FIVE (each) Martinis was made wrong, which they still double fisted, as well as their steak over seasoned and cooked well done however, \"we will take it home.\"  The man got in the face of the acting manager (who is normally the head bartender) and threatened him to the point the cops were going to be called.    We had a wonderful dinner and just wanted to credit the bartender/acting manager for handling the situation well and being professional. He didn't cater to them or their passive aggressive rude behavior. He handled the situation perfectly.   I feel more terribly for the couple next to us who was dressed up and celebrating their anniversary and had to sit next to this low rent couple. When they didn't engage, they were called \"typical f'ing liberals.\" Hopefully they still had a good dinner regardless of this couple.   Our night was entertaining to say the least with an unfortunate reminder that money doesn't buy class however, our food was excellent as always and we will be back soon.",

My husband ordered the carrot ginger soup and I ordered the gold and red beet salad. Both were good. Our ribeye steaks were also good. I asked them to substitute fries for the garlic mashed potatoes. The server said there would be a $2 charge, even though on the regular menu both are the same price. When we got the bill, we were charged $5 for the change. My husband ordered the edamame with corn side. The edamame and corn were swimming in some kind of cream/butter sauce; it looked unappetizing so I didn't even try it. My husband said it was meh. Because it was our anniversary, we could order a dessert from the standard menu. The chocolate lava/mousse was not too sweet and excellent.   The drinks. My husband ordered the ginger mule. It lacked any hint of ginger. The waiter apologized and brought him a new mule, that tasted no different. I ordered the cucumber cup.  It doesn't take much alcohol for me to feel it and quickly. I tasted not a hint of alcohol and by the time I had finished 1/2, I didn't have so much as a slight buzz.",

We waited for probably 8 minutes for someone to come by with water. Our server came by to introduce himself and almost as an after thought took our drink order. It only went downhill from there.  In short, our drinks sat empty for far too long, our waiter was missing for large chunks of time, he kept forgetting to take our orders, and got one of our orders wrong. The food was just average. We got the stuffed mushrooms, surf and turf, salmon, lobster Mac and cheese, and broccoli au gratin (which we never tried because the order was put through as plain broccoli and we were finished eating by the time it came out). The steak was weird tasting. It didn't cook evenly throughout and was almost chalky in texture. To top all of this off, the bathrooms were dirty (bordering gross) and had no paper towels. What the heck!?  When you come to a restaurant and spend $100 a person you expect great food and exceptional service. Instead, we got average food and pretty bad service. We were there for 2 hours, most of which was spent wondering where the waiter was. Look at my other reviews...we are not super picky and ridiculous people. We were hugely disappointed and will definitely never come here again.",

These were a nice touch and a great way to start the evening.    My wife ordered the filet, I had the Chilean sea bass.  Both were excellent, but after sharing tastes, I would have to say that my wife had the winning entree.  In fact, my wife claimed it was one of the best filets she has ever eaten.  Considering that we go to Las vegas 3 or 4 times a year and treat ourselves to big name restaurants, her glowing endorsement has credible weight behind it.   Throw in a couple sides that were large enough to share, drinks and desserts (my wife's birthday dessert was free) and the bill came out to about $175.  Not bad for a great eating experience.",

    "text": "One of my business partners came to town and suggested that we get a steak for dinner.  He went ahead and made a ressie for Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and since he was buying, he got to choose.  We walked in on time for our 7:00 pm reservation to be told that they weren't ready for us yet...in a half empty restaurant.  I was puzzled, but it seemed to be a ploy, more than anything else, to get us into the bar for a cocktail, before we went into the restaurant for...a cocktail. The service was, in a single well chosen word...perfunctory.  Our waiter went through the motions and didn't seem particularly pleased with Ruthies or with us. None of the staff seemed up and happy. Nobody was really smiling or friendly, and every phrase, every question, every move seemed designed to \"optimize\" us. Every word sounded like it came out of the corporate server manual. The food was OK. If you put enough butter on anything, you can make it taste pretty good, and they put some  butter on them there steaks, let me tell you!  The wine list is fine...I don't have the palate for fine pinot's that my partner does, but he found something from Oregon that he liked and you can't really screw up MacCallan's, neat:) After the initial enforced 20 minute wait for nothing, we were assembly lined through dinner in an hour. How very efficient! :) If it seems that I am being tough on Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, it's only because I am.  You know, when I spend (OK, I didn't spend a dime, dinner was on my partner and believe me when I tell you I deserved to be treated to a free dinner) $250 for 2 people, I want to see the love from everybody in the place, from the minute I walk in the door, through bringing the ice water and the MacCallan's, to perfection in the art of appetizer's, entree's, desserts and coffee.  I see the love in other places (both considerably more expensive and significantly less expensive, so it's not a case of me just being crabby about pricey dinner spots:), and it just doesn't come shining through here. I just don't get that anybody really gives a crap at Ruthies'. I'm probably wrong, and everybody cares about us, \"the valued customer\", like the very dickens.  As far as Ruthie's being a chain, so we should expect the corporate approach, well...I see chains where the service is caring and enthusiastic, even if they are serving double-doubles and a coke for $5.45, not steak and scotch for $100+ per, and the fresh faces smiling at me aren't making a $50 tip on my dinner, either. So I know it can be done...and should be done:) BTW, clear up the confusion for me...I know who \"Ruth\" is, but who or what is her \"Chris\"?",

I asked her why, and she said at Ruths Chris they store the wine at 55 degrees...ok all good for storage, but you DO NOT serve the wine at 55, smarty...you serve at 65 degrees.  Again...willing to let pass.  Now, I am just getting back to the Chicken and Turkey world after eating just fish for 3yrs. I ordered an Herb Cheese Stuffed Chicken Breast and my mom ordered the BBQ Shrimp. w/ side of Spinach Au Gratin. When food came out I was thrown when the breast of chicken was split w/ a crack down the middle, had 2 bones sticking out of either side and was served on this small plate which made the appearance of the food look like a giant chicken butt...I'm so sorry...it did.  I just looked at my mom and said...I cannot eat this. Since when do chicken breasts have bones, and why isn't that the description on the menu???  Erin was chatting up the table behind us with \"flair\" that she seemed to be missing while serving us.  So, I very nicely asked the gentleman waiter who was walking by for his help, and help he did.  He immediately made me feel comfortable and like a proper customer...whisked up my plate and asked what else he could get me. ( I will not know how she would have handled it, but I doubt very much like he did.)  I ordered the Halibut, and just as he walked away I looked over at my mother and she said...please taste one of my shrimp.  At first I thought she was doing that because it would be a while until l ate, but quickly realized it was because the shrimp were like rubber.  Unfortunately, we had another issue on our hands and although the chicken probably tasted okay and I could not get past the look...now we have over cooked shrimp, at Ruths Chris???  C\"MON!  They made my mom another plate of shrimp and brought me a beautifully done extremely tasty piece of Halibut but guess what, her shrimp was overdone AGAIN!!!  We were both sooo turned off at this point that we just wanted to wrap the Halibut scrap the shrimp and get the heck out of Dodge.  Erin came over and instead of apologizing she told my mom how many BBQ Shrimp dishes she sells nightly and she can't understand it.  Really? Is that how you handle it? Meanwhile, the male waiter (who I wish I could find his card and list his name) brought the manager over.  The manager was deeply apologetic and handled the rest of the evening with the class a restaurant of this caliber should.  They just charged us for the 4 glasses of wine we had ($40)  and we tipped $30 because we have class but I wish it could have gone to the other waiter. WON'T BE BACK...SHOULD HAVE GONE TO HOUSTONS!  BTW...Spinach Au Gratin was really tasty. :)",

Made a reservation and we arrived we were promptly seated right next to the server station where we were able to witness all orders being placed in the computer and hear what each employee was doing this weekend. Really should have asked for a decent table but my son had his girlfriend along so didn't want to make a scene. Food was great as expected, though we sat and patiently waited for our plates to be cleared and order desert along with 2 of us needing refills on drinks. After eventually  piling our plates up for removal, we finally were able to catch the eye of our server  as she and another employee were watching the playoff games from the server area. She then told us that someone would be out to clear our plates which several minutes later someone did....news flash you clear the plates and quit watching the nfl playoffs. So after that our server returned and we were able to get some refills and order desert. I expected the $300 tab for dinner but also expected superior service which was NOT given. So,,,,, overall great food but they need to pull their head out of the clouds and fix their service issues. I won't be back despite the food",

    "text": "This Ruth's Chris Steak House is located at Scottsdale and Indian Bend roads.  The dining area is somewhat darkly lit.  To begin, I like any of the shrimp -- whether it be the Barbecued Shrimp or Shrimp Cocktail. For the entree, I recommend a Filet or a T-Bone; the latter, if you have a big appetite.  Appetizer prices range from about $13 to $16. Steaks range from about $35 to $45. However, there is a Porterhouse that is to feed two people. The Porterhouse for two is upwards of about $80.  My main problem with Ruth's Chris Steak House is that they seem to butter the steak excessively. Moreover, the prices are a bit inflated for what you get -- which is expected.  Perhaps my discontent is with the mass-produced feel I get with any chain restaurant (not just Ruth's Chris).",

Then as they went back to fix her meal again, they just let mine sit out in front of me and get cold, cause you know if I started eating before her, not a good idea. When they finally brought her meal, we told them that mine wasn't hot anymore so they went back and nuked it, nuked it, I am paying $150+ for the 2 of us. Oh hell no!!! So we choked down our meals which were all right, I have had better. No apologies, no manager apologies, nothing. Might not ever go back!!!!!",

    "text": "Well, what a disappointment! We went there because of several positive reviews from my husband's coworkers. I love meat and 90% of the time I order meat in the restaurants. This is not the place to eat good steak/fillet mignon unless you like your meat floating in butter.  What kind of steak house is this? They don't offer a single sauce with their meat! The meat itself was just fine, nothing special. I didn't like my sizzling plate with a boiling steak in it... Bring me sizzling meat in a different plate if you want to show that you just cooked it.  Potato side dishes are horrific in their size. They don't give you a human portion along with your steak; you have to order it separately, and the portion they bring is good for at least 3 people. If you want mashed potato and your date/partner/etc wants to have e.g. potato gratin, you have to order 2 separate side dishes (around $7 for each or something in that range), which are big enough to feed 6 people. We didn't even finish our meals.  Oh, and some people sitting there were acting as if it's the fanciest place on earth. It's not, believe me.  I had better fillet mignon at Christopher Fermier.  Save your time and money unless you like your food soaked in butter.",

He wanted me to have a perfect scallop, so he ordered more for me , and they were perfect.  my husband had the steak filet and shrimp. very tender.For  Dessert I had the sin chocolate cake- and my husband had the honey cinnamon cheesecake with peach compote. I gave then 5 stars because they fixed the scallops, otherwise it would have been 4 stars",

    "text": "To quickly summarize my feelings of our experience at Ruth Chris's: Thank goodness we had a giftcard that paid for part of our meal! If we had paid full price, my husband and I would have felt more ripped off than we did when we left.  Now, we don't mind dropping $145 for a dinner if the food is really good and the atmosphere is amazing. Sadly, neither was True at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  My husband had the petit filet and shrimp combo for dinner. While he said the shrimp were very good, he said the steak was just OK. Definitely not the most amazing steak he has ever ate.  I had the crab cake entree, which was three lump crab cakes. Was it worth the almost $30 pricetag? Heck no! I appreciated that there was really no filling and it was lump crab meat, it was way way too moist for me.  I don't like my crabcakes bone dry, but I don't like them overly moist. McCormick and Schmick's are way too dry, but Ruth Chris's are way too moist. Blah. Also, there was too much horseradish or something like along those lines for my taste.  I can't wait to visit my parents in Maryland this summer to actually get some good crabcakes.  Our mashed potato side that we ordered was large enough for the two of us, but the potatos were meh.  The $1 instant potatoes we buy at Fry's are better and have more flavor.  For dessert, we had the cheesecake. I'm sorry to say that the cheesecake at The Cheesecake Factory is 10x better than what I ate at Ruth Chris's.  Our waiter was very nice...attentive but not overbearing or pushy. The atmosphere was just OK.  We had reservations, but still had to wait almost 20 minutes to be seated...WTF? And for an \"upscale\" restaurant, I was shocked to see people roll in with jeans and sweatshirts on! Yuck.  My husband and I said that it is highly unlikely we will ever go back to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  High prices do not equal good food.",

Was there friday night and ordered the steak special for the evening which was the bone in filet...it was amazing, my boyfried got the petite I think, which as good but not as good as mine. Our server was very polite and helpful and friendly. We ordered the crab cakes for our appetizer, which were bland. I'm a purist when it comes to crabcakes...the more lumps of pure crab the better and the simpler the better, these had other ingredients I find unnecessary, but still surprisingly  stayed bland. We also ordered the scalloped potatoes which were cut too thick thus not allowing to become tender all the way through and still raw in the middle. We told our server not askiing to speak to the manager, but she came over anyway. You could tell from the get go she was put out and annoyed at our dislike for the potatoes and bothering her even though we were very polite and didn't ask for them to be removed from the bill even, and we knew it would go in one ear and out the other as they often do in finer restaurants, but oh well. And for this reason, I won't return. I went for a fabulous steak which i did get but the whole package is the sum of it's parts, and all the parts weren't up to par",

Our Waiter was fine, although neither of us can recall his name.     He unfortunately has the misfortune of working at this restaurant.   As soon as we walked into this second floor restaurant, there was a \"huge sign\" stating \"excuse our dust\".    It probably would have been nice if we had been told there is \"crap\" in the air when the reservation was made.    We were told conflicting stories: a.  The restaurant is remodeling ; and, b.  They just moved there.    We both became ill from whatever we were breathing--surprising the Health Department allows them to operate.     The Ruth's Chris family of restaurants should be ashamed.    That's okay, it's the last time I will eat at Ruth's Chris; there are far too many options to settle for mediocrity.     Maestro's is ALWAYS a great choice for steak.   Capitol Grill is outstanding too.         We started with a wedge salad; most underwhelmed mg salad I have ever eater.    No taste...no \"goodies\"...Perhaps they forgot about tomatoes.    The lettuce was not cold or crisp.    I don't recall there being croutons.    Avoid the wedge salad.        Among the sides we ordered was asparagus.    One does not need to be a talented chef to properly prepare asparagus.    These spears were \"woody\" and virtually uneatable.    The bone-in filet was okay; but, the flavor was nothing like it used to be.         If a \"friend\" suggests going to Ruth's Chris, suggest going elsewhere and re-think your friendship.",

I ordered the ribeye and when my ribeye came out, I notice the cut was very lobsided. It's not a nice full piece of meat. There were lumps here and there like the chef did not know how to cut it.   Other than that, the menu is a la carte meaning you pay extra if you want any kind of sides. The sides were good portion but nothing taste worthy to mention.   I rather go to Don Shula's if I'm paying this price because at least their food would not disappoint.   Service was meh, they leave you waiting most of the time so dinner took almost 2.5 hours...",

I would go again but definitely order the chicken that the fiance had.",

We had a great table and 4 ladies next to us were drinking either pink martinis or cosmos through the night and making a racket.  Everyone ate steaks so we have an idea about their steaks. We also all had salads and deserts. I had the menu fix which can with a smaller wedge salad and desert. The steaks came with nothing- on a tiny platter barely large enough for the streak- had to get the side for $$$ more.  Food: 3 atmosphere: 4 parking: 4 service: 4 wine: 3 value: 3",

However, there was a very high maintenance couple that kept our waiter from getting to us for a full 15 minutes at least.  Then, we poured our own wine which is not a big deal except that this particular couple was watching TV on their phones at the table.  Come on - you've got to set and hold some basic courtesy rules in a restaurant with the kind of ticket price we're talking about at Ruth's Chris.  There's a standard that is not being met.",

We had a private room for 20 people to celebrate family birthdays in April and May and happen to be during restaurant week.  Our servers handled our party with ease and professionally with class.  I ordered the restaurant week special that came with Tomato Soup with Crab, 12 oz Petite Ribeye and Chocolate Cake.  The Tomato Soup had a little kick to it but was very tasty. The Ribeye has awesome, served medium rare as ordered and definitely cooked on butter the way it is supposed to be. It was topped off with the Double Chocolate Cake. With the birthdays, we're given a creme brulee and a cheesecake which both were exceptional.   Can't praise the exceptional experience enough, food, service and private room.  Definitely 5 stars!",

The flavoring was so delicious!! My fiance ordered the ribeye and he absolutely loved it! For sides I ordered the grilled asparagus and my fiance ordered the shoestring fries. The sides are a very big size so it's best to share. I also had the raspberry Rosemary Cosmo which was good.   The restaurant made our evening very special and since it was my fiance' birthday he even got dessert.  I think my only disappointment was that they didn't have any rice as a side. And I love rice with my steak. The customer service was amazing and this place is definitely worth it for a special occasion!",

The 16 Ounce Ribeye was cooked medium per my request and was a good steak... prepared well and just the right amount of marveling. It did not blow my mind in the simple butter sauce but it was a good steak. Some creative  addition of some unique mysterious goodness usually can get the 5th star from me...  4 out of 5! Lyonnaise Potatoes were a surprisingly good presentation of a wedge French fry covered in caramelized onions... they were quite good.  5 out of 5! The Clam Chowder was surprisingly delectable and was superior to all others I had tasted before!   4 out of 5! For dessert I had the Chocolate Lava Cake With Chocolate Mousse. The cake was extremely well made and presented splendidly. I would have only preferred the cake be slightly larger in size as it was delicious but suddenly it was all gone...  3 out of 5 stars... Service from the waitress... she was nominally friendly for a moment but didn't seem to be having a good night. When I wanted more coffee if was not an easy task. I think she didn't mean any wrong but she definitely wasn't in her game... I asked her to leave the coffee pot for me if it was easier and she just took it and left... someone expecting a $20-$40 tip on a $150-$200 meal should be providing service commensurate with that expectation....",

From the outside, the restaurant doesn't seem like much because it's upstairs and tucked in a corner of a plaza but when you arrive, your greeted with smiling employees ready to open the door for you.   The young hostess up front was beautiful and very friendly. We had reservations on a Saturday night and had to wait to be seated which is understandable- although the restaurant didn't seem that full.  Upon being seated, our waiter (Ben) was very attentive to our needs and did a fantastic job! He deserves a raise. He was kind enough to tell me a little bit about the restaurant and their food and even advised we cover ourselves with a napkin when the steaks are served to avoid getting butter splashed on us from the heat of 500 degree plates (insane).   Now to review the steak; for $56 I ordered the T-bone. Yes, that's what they charged for one steak. All appetizers are separate unless you order the 3 course dinner. I contemplated ordering a smaller steak and perhaps a side but I thought to myself if this place is known for steaks, I need to go all out. It was the best steak I've ever had in my life! Salt, pepper, and parsley is all the seasoning they used to make the steak and it was perfect. Every bite gushed with melted butter and the texture was super smooth and tender.   The people I was with ordered smaller steaks and sides and were nice enough to share. I tried their asparagus, garlic mashed potatoes, and cauliflower. All of the sides were delicious and I left feeling full and pleasantly surprised.   Between the friendly staff, fantastic t-bone, and romantic atmosphere, this place deserves 5 stars from me. My only complaint is how expensive it is.",

We finally flagged him down and asked to see our waiter. 10 minutes later the waiter brought out a birthday dessert with a candle. He set it down and was going to walk away and then on second thought asked if we'd like dessert menus. I said no thank you, I'd like the bill. The person next to me leaned over to me and said \"I would have liked a dessert menu a half hour ago\". It was the same thing I was thinking. I will not go back to this Ruth Chris's.

There were a few times I had to ask for a refill on my water and twice asked for more bread. I did not like that our steaks came out on sizzling plates but due to the service staff not knowing which plate went where, the plates were no longer sizzling when it got to us. The plates were still hot but not sizzling to give that effect.  The part that really was disappointing with me was they overcharged us and added a lobster tail to our bill when I did not order it - and did not receive it. The strange part, the waitress asked me if I was suppose to have a lobster tail and I told her no, so you would've thought she would make sure our bill was accurate. We were with friends and chatting, so when the bill came, we paid it without going over the itemized bill. You just assume the bill will be accurate but that is our error. I called the restaurant and the manager apologized and credited back the lobster tail. She then offers to send a gift card for the inconvenience. I just think at a high end restaurant, accurate billing is a must.",

Last week my friend and I sat on the patio for 20 minutes as the wait staff walked around, ignoring us.  When we finally ordered our drinks (which we had picked from the website happy hour menu) we were told that those were not on the happy hour menu...the waitress had no intention of honoring the website list, nor discussing it.    When our food came, my sliders were very dry...I waited for the waitress to come back around, so I could ask for mustard.  I waited...and waited...and waited....   Finally, I got up and asked the hostess to please get me some mustard.  Through the evening, I ended up asking the hostess for mustard, more water, and the bill because our waitress was missing in action.  We didn't decide to go to a local haunt for a drink, nor did we decide to go to a mega-chain restaurant.....we chose the upscale spot, payed the upscale prices and expected an upscale experience, which we did not get!!!",

It was game night (and it was super packed)  but we were able to catch a bar table right away which didn't bother us since we wanted to be able to see the game as well. Nice bar area, great service , awesome menu and delicious food or and strong tasty drinks ...  I don't normally eat red meat but i made exception and had a bite of bf's (didn't help it had toasted blue cheese crumbs on it) and it was a orgasm in my mouth. You love steak? You will love Ruth's Chris. i tried a stuffed chicken that was cooked perfectly. the sides you choose are def large enough to share so we tried a few and enjoyed them all.",

    "text": "Great service and top notch food.  We went to the Ruth's Chris Steakhouse on a whim 30 minutes before closing time.  There were still several tables with customers in the restaurant.  I have dietary restrictions, so when the waiter came to the table I informed him of my restrictions and then I told him I wanted a full meal,  two appetizers, an entree and a dessert.  I asked him to choose.  He asked me how I liked my steak, rare, and how my husband liked his, medium.  I also asked him to pair a wine with each course (three) as I wasn't going to drive.     The appetizers were a delight, and perfectly matched to a mellow mixed white.  We had the jumbo shrimp cocktail and a crab salad thing (I don't know the names as I didn't order them by name).    The steaks were perfectly cooked to our preferences,  mine a bone-in lean fillet that was rare, near to blue, just the way I like it.  It was so tender it nearly melted in my mouth.  My husbands was a rib-eye that was just this side of medium, just the way he likes it.  These were paired with a side of asparagus, huge stalks but still tender and not stringy, as well as a simple creamy mashed potato.  The wine was a lovely Cabernet that had a perfect pairing with my steak.  It didn't go as well with the rib-eye (I stole a bite) but was an absolute match with the one I had.  Then it was time for dessert.  I stepped away from the table when the desserts came,  but there was a chocolate cake and a creme brulee.  I was meant to have the chocolate cake, but on double checking the ingredients it was discovered (as most chocolates do) to contain soy, so it was switched.  I have never previously had a creme brulee that I liked, but this was so delicate and smooth I had no difficulty finishing the robust portion I was given.  This was paired with a desert wine that would have gone well with the chocolate, but was too similar in flavor to the creme.  I mentioned this to the waiter when he asked how things were going, and he immediately brought back two different dessert wines for me to taste to find one to go with the dessert.  They were both quite good, but one was much more full flavored with the creme.  The waiter mentioned that he would make a note on my account so that in future I could order that particular wine the next time I have the creme brulee.  Now that is service.   All in all I received exactly what I wanted.  The waiter, Ken, was attentive and there was never a time when I didn't feel like a special patron.    I mentioned that I arrived at 30 minutes before closing.  We were there a good  2 hours at least and I never felt rushed or as though I was disturbing them, though I know that meant the chef was stuck in the kitchen too! I would also like to mention that I was wearing a T-shirt, not dressed up in any way, unless you consider a chive-on shirt dressing up. This did not affect the manner in which I was treated at all.   The service was wonderful and I felt welcome and appreciated.  You can bet I will be back again and soon.",

    "text": "The food is out of this world! Definitely the best place to eat in Arizona. My hubby & I ate the bone in filet and our daughter ate the salmon. We asked the server Ben to only add light pepper & salt to the salmon & when it was served, it was covered heavily in pepper. So we sent it back, had them recook another with NO pepper & it came served to us again with heavy pepper. So the manager took it off our bill. That's the only issue we had here or else it would have been rated 5 stars instead of the 4. The desserts we ordered were the cheesecake, banana crusted pie thing, and vanilla ice-cream. They used Hagen Daz ice-cream which is our favorite and it tasted delicious, especially with the banana dessert. I don't appreciate hostesses being on their cell phones while greeting customers like the hostess who's from Dallas that greeted us at the door, but the lovely Maddie (Madeline) was a delight. And I know it wasn't anything related to the restaurant because she was checking a personal text. Larry served us this heated butter with BBQ sauce and garlic, it was to die for!!!! So flavorful with all the flavors exploding in your mouth! Pair it with their sour dough bread or with their jumbo shrimp like I did! The food was THE best part of this restaurant!",

The tomatoes soup with crab was good. Not as hot as it should have been but tasty. The entree, filet with shrimp was a strange cut of meat. Not a filet but what appeared like ends. It wasn't just mine, the second guest had the same and choose not to eat it. Creamed spinach which is usually amazing here was watery and not hot.  The horseradish arrived well into the meal and had to be requested twice. My husband had the seafood trip and the lobster was very over cooked. The desert was good. I asked for cutlery  and was told that my spoon was beside me. I prefer not to eat  cake with a spoon. And I especially prefer not to be reprimanded by my waiter. Yes you Ben. You were not obliging. Service was slow and grudging. Save your money. Don't bother with dinner here until after restaurant week is over.",

We opted to sit outside on a beautiful evening. Not your typical patio, the tables and chairs were higher-end quality and very comfortable. With the fireplace and candles on each table, the ambiance was just right. A great date night spot ;)  I'll start off by saying that the service we received was outstanding. Our server Erika was very attentive and on point with everything. As for the food...I don't know...maybe it's just me, but I don't get the whole steak-drowning-in-a-plate of sizzling butter thing. If I were to ever eat there again, I would probably request no butter because...well...a good steak is good all by itself, and I thought it altered the flavor. The sides we chose were ok...but it's kinda hard to screw up vegetables. The corn chowder and Caesar salad starters were tasty, but the desert was a bit lacking. The cheesecake is a sour cream base and served in a graham cracker bowl. The banana cream pie comes in a flaky crust topped with carmelized bananas. The presentation of both deserts looked great, but the consistencies were unexpected, a bit \"soupy\".  Everything was good here, but to be completely honest, I've had better at lower price points. Expect to pay around $100 per person for a meal and 2 drinks here.   Service (5) + Atmosphere (4) + Food (3) = overall rating (4)",

Their steaks really do melt in your mouth. Yes, it is pricey but worth every penny.",

    "text": "Pretty bad. Both the wife's and my steaks were over cooked. Mine was well done (ordered rare) and hers was well (from a medium order). The waiter told us it was the lighting before finally conceding. The two tables next to us sent their food back too. Waiter reached across wife and forked her steak to put on a plate to take back... Not top tier service by any means.   Manager offered us a side dish as an apology... We declined. So much for a special dinner. The one and only time Flemings has messed up a steak they comp'd.  But that's probably because it's so rare that it happens there, clearly not the case at Chris's. Pretty sad, nowhere near the hype. For $100/ea (no drinks) I'd expect better service and better quality food.",

I hear the lobster bisque is really good too but I don't like lobster ( I know right!) So if you're into that give it a try. For dessert the chocolate cake is truly decadent. The service is what you'd expect it to be, spotless. Very helpful, informative and nice staff in a welcoming ambiance. Last tip- get the pepper sauce on your filet, trust me it just takes it to another level.",

My husband is a meat and potato guy and has never  had the opportunity to enjoyRuth Chris's. We arrived on time and was greeted warmly at the door. We were seated at a table in the middle by a very nice gentlemen who pulled my chair out. All the booths were reserved already. We were immediately given our menu's and told our waitress would be Krystal. The ambience of the dining room was delightful, the music was perfection. The lighting was just right. My husband looked impressed and that never happens.  We were greeted by our lovely Team member Krystal, she was so nice and had a pleasant way about her.she took our drink order and was very prompt. I noticed that all of the team members were well groomed,professional and worked together in unison like a well choreographed scene in a great movie, it was fun to watch, the view out of the windows was beautiful as well.  We ordered a split dinner of a Ceaser Salad with shaved parmigiana cheese, 16 ounce Ribeye and loaded baked potato, it was sizzling fantastic!!! our drinks were never empty and I cannot remember when the last time I had this great of service.The manager came to our table to make sure we were happy and by the time we were finished with our perfect dinner, Krystal said that she is bringing us dessert for our Anniversary, we could not believe how good the raspberry sorbet, key lime cheesecake and a salted raspberry nut chocolate bar was. I was disappointed that I left my phone at home so that we could get a picture of us together, But Krystal saved the day, she snapped a picture of us and brought it to us at the end of our night!  Thank you Ruth Chris's for a very lovely Wedding Anniversary Dinner.",

Well it is NOT GOOD in Scottsdale AZ I ordered petite filet Oscar style. I also asked for it to be rare and he told me it's cold inside so I said to make it med rare with more toward rare. My husband ordered medum My steak was well on outside and medium rare hot center.   When I called waiter Alejandro over, he practically argued with me and told me to move the crab off my steak and cut in center. He pulled out a flash light and shined it on my steak! When . He may have disagreed  with me but I'm the customer. I was so mad I just told him it it's fine and leave it. I left my steak mostly, my husbands steak was rare and just like I wanted it. service was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. What a waste of time..forget the money, it's the principal!  Don't waste your money Oh by the way, I forgot to say that I called to ask if I can come a little earlier than my reservation. They said no, which was fine. But when we got there early anyway there were so many available tables. What a crock of a place.",

    "text": "I have eaten at this Ruth Chris several times at the invitation of various financial seminar/estate planning companies looking for leads.  BTW I always show them my statements and consider what advice they can offer me.  I always order the filet mignon, cos it is something most people don't eat regularly like they would salmon, which is on sale so many places every week.  The filet mignon just about melts in your mouth.  I like Ruth Chris filet mignon over Flemings just because the butter on it makes a big difference.    The usual sides of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes are sooo delicious.  I take home the leftovers that everyone else leaves behind.    The decaf is really strong and full-bodied too.  The one consistent fault with a dinner here, and it happens EVERYTIME, is they never put enough salad dressing on the salad.  I don't know why many people don't think or want to ask the servers for more dressing, but everyone agreed there wasn't enough.  I had to have them bring out dressing in a gravy urn, because I said all of us considered the dressing to be too scanty.  I noticed other tables asked for more dressing too.  Their dressing is delicious too.    I hope the cooks who make the salad will read this and put more dressing on the salad or at least bring a gravy urn of extra dressing to each table, if they insist on serving it with soooo little dressing.  If it weren't for the scanty dressing and having to ask for more, I would rate this Ruth Chris 5 stars.    Oh BTW, I am a single senior with no family or friends, no one to travel with.  My cruise cabinmate bailed on me.  I was so desperate to find someone to take her place as the cruise line was billing me \"overdue\" $12,000 for single supplement cos the other lady never put down her deposit  for months.  Well at my last dinner here April 2018, hosted by financial planner Jeremy Melberg, I met my cabin mate Judy, a total stranger, sitting to my right at my table.  We are leaving for Russia on 13-day (11 on the ship) Viking River Cruise \"Waterway of the Tsars\" day after tomorrow Aug 11, 2018.  She paid right away and is so excited, cos it was on her bucket list.  She even let me sleep a night in her bedroom so I could see she doesn't snore like the condescending and MEAN \"Harley\" I had to room with on my first Viking cruise, 2016.  She was also a stranger.",

I never mind paying more money for quality food .. but I don't want to feel like I'm crammed into a dinning area when doin so !

We started with the Crab Stack which had lumps of blue crab atop avocado and mango, which was a substitute for our salad. I ordered the petite rib eye, 12 oz and my wife had the petite filet, 6 oz, and lobster. I decided to add 6 shrimp to my steak. On the side, we added mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted great. My steak was seasoned well, but just a bit salty. As a dessert, they brought out marvelous and tasty treat.",

Not because there's something wrong with the food, but because it's SO DAMN DELICIOUS we can't help but stuff WAYYYYY too much food down our throats, and still want more.  The steaks are TOP NOTCH - I'm literally salivating right now just thinking about the perfect seared crust, basted in butter and cooked to perfection.  My filet could be eaten with a spork, that's how tender it is EVERY SINGLE TIME.  The baked potato (loaded, obvi) is always heavenly, and the wine list is amazing.  Honestly, I can't speak to any other food, because this is the meal I dream about and I'd never even think about going off-brand and ordering something outside of my perfect meal. My husband, however, swears by the ribeye and the NY strip - both equally tasty, according to him.  We also love the green beans (put some green on your plate so you don't feel so gluttonous).  I am writing this at 9am on a Tuesday morning, and now all I can think about is steak. So thanks, Ruth's Chris.  Thanks for the food baby.",

It doesn't like look like much when you see it from the outside but when you are inside it looks like a totally different place. They have outdoor seating which is great for those lovely Arizona nights. The ambiance inside is very romantic which I always appreciate in a restaurant such a Ruth's. The staff here are all really nice and the service here was really quick. The food was amazing as always and was 100% satisfied. I love Ruth's steakhouses and I would definitely come back to this location if I am in the area again.",

The views from the 2nd floor are very nice. You can also tell the place is having a few cosmetic issues inside as well as outside. The patio furnishings are not very comfortable and after sitting there for over 2 hours I had the worst lower back pain I've ever had! I had to cut the evening short because of it.   Back to the food. I ordered the Mozzarella &Heirloom Tomato Salad which was very good. The Barbecued Shrimp on a bed of mashed potatoes was disappointing because I had no idea it was so \"soupy\". I had to eat it with a spoon  (did I miss something when I ordered it? )  I had a few bites of my boyfriends steak and it was bland,  absolutely no taste at all. Granted they only season their steaks with salt and pepper but come on, I make a better tasting steak at home.  All in all its a little too pricey for bland food.",

    "text": "We are from out of town and wanted to go somewhere special for our anniversary.  The Phoenix area certainly has far more choices than Albuquerque so when we decided on Ruth's Chris I checked out the reviews and made an OpenTable reservation on Yelp, which worked out great.    Our reservations were for a Sunday early evening and we were seated immediately.  Our server and bus staff were very helpful, patient and provided recommendations that we appreciated.  My starting drink (Tanqueray & tonic) was served quickly and made perfectly.    The restaurant has a great, open dining area and a large patio with an outdoor fireplace to warm your bones on those balmy 105 degree Scottsdale evenings like when we dined.    Since it was our first time dining at Ruth's Chris, our server explained a bit about the restaurant and the way they do things.  We ordered a salad, our entrees and sides as well as a glass of wine (the house cabernet blend - DELICIOUS).  The food and drinks were delicious, the service was excellent and the overall experience was excellent.  I normally order my steaks medium but on the server's recommendation I went with medium-rare Cowboy (Bone-In) Ribeye.  It was cooked a little more than I expected but was served sizzling and tasted DELICIOUS, especially when paired with the red wine mentioned above.  My wife ordered the Petite Filet and lobster tail, which was also delicious.  We had sides of mac and cheese (awesome) and garlic mashed potatoes (very good).  We finished the evening with bread pudding (very good) and coffee (excellent).  Although the prices can be high it really wasn't outrageous.  Obviously, wine & cocktails can escalate the bill quickly but we weren't disappointed with anything about our evening.  Although we certainly brought our appetites we were only able to eat ~ 1/2 of our meals and the staff was happy to box everything up for us to enjoy later.    Overall, we had a wonderful dining experience at Ruth's Chris Steak House and we would absolutely return.",

Ruth's Chris is a perfect blend of Arizona dressy - it's a fancy-ish place but there are people in shorts, jeans, etc.  I enjoy eating off of white tablecloths without being dressed to the hilt.    Drinks were fantastic.  We tried the strawberry basil gimlet, the blackberry sidecar, and the blueberry mojito.  That alone makes me want to come back for happy hour.    We started with crab cakes which may have been the best crab cakes I've ever had.  Perfectly cooked flaky crab with nary a hint of fishiness, resting comfortably in melted butter.    The steaks arrive on 500  degree plates swimming in butter and that is a beautiful thing.  All of the sides I sampled (mushrooms, potatoes au gratin an asparagus) were tasty although the mushrooms were a tiny bit bland.   Service was attentive and friendly.  It IS expensive so if you aren't prepared for this, there might be a bit of sticker shock.  We knew in advance that it would be on the spendy side.    Great experience and I look forward to going back!",

I told my wife I was sick, but she never listens (kinda like me).  Anyway, we rounded out restaurant week here with a 12 oz. ribeye, some creamed spinach, and tempura battered onion rings. All of it was damned tasty, even on a sick stomach.  Sadly, for anyone leaving after us, they would have had to negotiate my dinner on the sidewalk in front of the elevator.  Also, my wife, whose shoes got caught by some wayward spinach splash, was pretty bummed, although I'm not sure why. I can't figure out if it was her ruined shoes, or if she was upset we just spent 170 bucks and half of it wound up on a sidewalk.  Anyways, my sincere apologies to management, and, the poor shite who had to clean up the mess.",

Bartender was not too aloof, yet eager to answer any question when I had any.    Have you had a chance to look over Ruth Chris' HH (happy hour) menu, yet?  There's a lot to choose from!  Now that I think of it, I'm surprised I haven't been back since.  After studying the menu for many minutes, I decided I'd try the burger, which I'd like to say was $12 (or was it $9?).  Whatever the cost, it was worth it!  Perfectly-grilled and juicy eight-ounce patty, topped w/ a GENEROUS amount of blue cheese, some partially-melted (oh my!), on top of a buttered and grilled bun.  The burger also came w/ lovely and superbly-crisped fries!  Not a soggy one in the bunch, which was great in the short-term, but not-so-great for me in the long-term (so many extra calories I'd normally be saving by ditching soggy fries!  LOL).  A must-order entree!  BTW, I tried a little of the complimentary sourdough table bread and butter while waiting for my meal- crusty, good stuff!",

We felt very welcomed.  I ordered the 22oz T-Bone cooked medium and the birthday girl had the 11oz filet medium as well. Our sides were mushrooms and potatoes Au gratin. All was delicious but I regret not trying the Lobster Mac n Cheese. All steaks were cooked as ordered and the potatoes were amazing!   Our server was very attentive and he surprised us with a complimentary birthday dessert at the end of our dinner. Great experience! A++",

    "text": "We made reservations at Ruth's Chris Steak House over a year ago for Valentine's day 2015.  We had high expectations for a wonderful evening.  Unfortunately, the service was lacking, and our server Joey spent much of his time ignoring us.  It was interesting that a couple of his male friends were seated at a table next to us, and he spent time visiting and catching up with them repeatedly.  Joey would pass by us and wait on the table on the other side of us never acknowledging us, even when it was apparent we had finished eating. We even had to ask for a dessert menu.    We had no problems with the food.  It was served hot and was delicious, but when I go to a high end restaurant, I am not paying for just the food but the service.  We spent close to two hours there, and too much time waiting.  I realize it was a busy night, but they didn't seem to be anymore busy than many evenings as there were several open tables nearby.    Joey received a tip commensurate with the service we received.   In the future we will stick to eating in the bar.    As for YELP, shame on you for the disclaimer to use care in reviewing restaurants as they cannot remove negative reviews.  This review was justified.  If you don't want honest reviews posted then you shouldn't have this site!",

    "text": "We visited the steakhouse during restaurant week in Arizona. The steaks were arguably one of the best I've ever had.   Both my ribeye and my boyfriend's fillet mignonette were cooked perfectly.  I also recommend getting the blue cheese crust on top of the ribeye.   The best part of this restaurant was definitely the service. Our waiter found the perfect balance between making sure we had what we needed and not interrupting the mood or conversation.   If there was one thing that could've been improved it would've been the sides. The sweet potato casserole was very rich with too much brown sugar and the crabcake wasn't great either.   All in all it was a fantastic experience and would definitely recommend the steakhouse.",

I'm extremely picky about my filets, usually prefer my own to those in restaurants. My filet here was so tender it nearly melted in my mouth. Cooked perfectly at MR and delivered on a sizzling hot plate  The sides were good, salad good, but let's face it its all about the steak right? Best side is the sweet potato casserole.  Chocolate sin cake with espresso was fantastic Service was great, attentive without hovering.",

The food was amazing from the appetizer to the dessert however the service was mediocre... Rachael did not bother to make small talk or even ask how we were doing . When ever she would come to our table to ask how the food was we couldn't get past great before she was walking away. It took 30 minutes alone to order our dessert... i would understand this behavior if she was slammed but we were her only table ..  for such a nice restaurant you would expect better service",

Ruth Chris is by far better than Durant's, Arrowhead Steak , and Tom Colicchio's Craft Steak.   I try others but they are never as good.  The service is always excellent.    Drinks are excellent too.  The New Fashioned is so good if you like Whiskey.  Also, the Manhattan Eastside is to die for.  So smooth and yummy.  So if you are thinking of trying a high end steak place, select Ruth Chris. Also, they seem to always participate in restaurant week.  So if your on budget , go in September during Restaurant week (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Farizonarestaurantweek.com%2Frestaurants%2Fall-restaurants%2F&s=a6ea803ed22dd8b5f0ff6dc9991afa010f8eef312fb5d207e43fb1053f754a76\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">arizonarestaurantweek.co...</a>) when they have the $44.00  dinner.  I only wish they had not moved from Camelback to Scottsdale.  I need one on the west side!!!!",

Our server Matt was very attentive and helpful with menu recommendations. I LOVED the blueberry mojito. The raspberry cosmo was a little too sweet for my liking, so if you're into sweet cocktails it might be the perfect drink for you.  All of the food was delicious, but the sweet potato casserole was out of this world! The chocolate duo was also super tasty. I'd recommend saving room for dessert so you can try it. I would love to go back and try the bread pudding or the cheesecake.   It was a 5 star experience and hope to visit again soon.",

Frequented the Walnut Creek and San Francisco location often but this location was new to us.   First of all, elevator was down.. we didn't need it so we were fine. But then we were seated in the room with the garbage bag on the wall.  I get it we were with kids but dude that room should be closed! No one wants to pay $$$ to be seated in there.   Second the service.. Shanece(sp) was our server. She was ok except missed our drink order. We asked for Bourbon/Whiskey menu and it didn't arrive until apps came in. At 5:15pm on a warm Saturday afternoon, the restaurant wasn't that busy yet. But other than the drink menu everything else was fine.  Now onto the food... it was ok. For the price we paid for our meal we could have something much better with a better ambiance not bright with sun shining on our face, while we faced the black garbage bag wall.",

    "text": "We enjoyed a lovely Anniversary dinner at Ruth's Chris Steak House. I was able to get reservations online for a table and noted the reason for our visit within the reservation. It was fun to see their attention to detail when we arrived ... the hostess wished us a Happy Anniversary and our table had little decorations. At the end of our meal, we were also brought a dessert with \"Happy 2nd Anniversary\" written but more about that later.  For our dinner, I was debating between Salmon or Shrimp but ended up going with the Barbecue Shrimp which came a top garlic mashed potatoes. My husband went with the NY Strip Steak; all of their steaks are seasoned with salt & pepper and served on a 500 degree plate to keep it hot. Since we were in the mood to splurge a little, we also went with the Lobster Mac & Cheese and Creamed Spinach sides.  The Barbecue Shrimp were absolutely delicious! The dish came with 10 shrimp, and with the mashed potatoes, this was a very filling dish. My husband enjoyed his steak as well, he mentioned it was cooked well! There was so much food, we actually ended up bringing almost all of the mac and spinach home.  Oh! And for dessert, we were each brought a dessert with a Sea Salt Caramel Cheesecake and ice-cream. Personally, not a huge fan of the dessert but my husband really liked the cheesecake. Overall, a nice dinner for a special occasion if you're looking to treat yourself. Their menu options are quite expensive but as mentioned, the food was good and the service was also good.",

When I made the reservation, I put in the notes that it was for my bf's bday and his name. It a nice touch that the hostess wished him a happy birthday when walking us to the table, and the server and server's assistant both did as well. Our server, Cisco, was so sweet and attentive. He took a picture of us when we first arrived, and brought it out in a little card a little while later (see photo). (My only complaint with that is that the beautiful palm trees behind us were not in the photo-just the guy's head behind us lol..,but it was such a nice gesture, and no other restaurant I've been to has ever done that!)  Since it was our first time there, Cisco offered to put an order together for us, but I'm pretty picky so we declined.   The appetizers are mostly seafood, which I don't eat, so we started with the Veal Osso Bucco Ravioli, which were delicious-they are saffron infused pasta with a white wine Demi glaze-has a little kick to em. I ordered the filet mignon and my bf a ribeye, then we shared the fire-roasted corn and au gratin potatoes with a three cheese sauce! Everything was absolutely mouthwatering! =) can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "This review is as hard for me to write as it was for me to sit through my Christmas Dinner last night, witnessing the sheer and utter chaos around us.  If we had come to a \"run of the mill' typical steakhouse I would have expected some of the opportunities that Ruth's Chris had last night.  However, we were not at an average steakhouse, and straight from the mouths of Ruth's Chris, \"We hold ourselves to the highest brand standards for food quality, atmosphere and service.\"  Well... unfortunately they fell way short of this on Christmas.  I understand unfortunate things happen; employees don't show up, you take too many reservations, guests stay and \"camp\" therefore tables are not available when you think they will be, you run out of propane so 10 out of your 15 heaters are not working... I get it...this stuff happens.  What I don't get is, how these things happen and not a single manager addresses the issues, especially when your guests are paying top dollar for dinner?   We did not have a reservation and when my husband and I arrived at 6pm and we fully expected to have to wait for a table.  I did not expect the hostess to abruptly inform us upon our arrival that they were not taking walkins, it was reservations only for a table and the only seating they were offering was the bar or the patio.  Both were first come, first serve.  The bar was full, but there was plenty of seating out on the patio. We were told to grab any table we wanted.  We sat and were eventually greeted by our server, then another server came over (Side note: She had long hair, two french braids, with tiny little Christmas bows on her head, I didn't get her name but she was the only person last night who truly seemed to enjoy her job, dealt well with the hiccups of the night and was the ONLY one smiling and engaged with not only her tables but the other tables on the patio as well.  PLEASE do something special for this girl, she is a gem of an employee, and I hope you realize that!). Our actual server was very nonchalant and appeared to be miserable.  She was less than helpful with the menu, no suggestions, no specials, no nothing and didn't know what Gins you carry (I made the mistake of asking) she really could have cared less what we wanted and when we wanted it.  I ended up getting a Hendricks Martini and my husband ordered an Amstel.  She eventually came to get an appetizer order from us, we started with the Squash Soup and the Tomato, Basil, Mozzarella Salad.  I asked if the balsamic could come on the side.  Sadly it was delivered with the tomatoes tossed in balsamic and balsamic on the side...  I enjoyed it but my husband couldn't eat it.  The server even asked if it was an allergy, I told her no, but if it had Balsamic ON it, he would not be able to eat it.  As I said, it came covered in Balsamic.  Oh well.  Next up, Alec comes over with bread and butter for our table.  Nice gesture, but we could have done with out him literally tossing it down on the table and just walking away.  This kid clearly was NOT enjoying his job!  He was miserable and made it known to all around him.  Clanking dishes as he aggressively cleared the tables, mumbling under his breath as he desperately tried to get heaters lit (NONE of them would light) and just all around scowls on his face every time someone asked him for something.  How and why is management nowhere in sight?  How is it OK for your employees to walk around miserable, fight to get heaters lit (which as I said NONE of them would light), and struggle to keep their guests happy while not a single manager is present.  I am sorry but you have all really failed your employees and your guests.  I would expect this kind of behavior from a Joe Shmoe steak house but not from Ruth's Chris when my husband and I just spent $250.  I hope you all scratch your heads, have a meeting and do some hard core soul searching to realize what it is that is keeping you all employed and in business.  Here's a hint: IT'S YOUR GUESTS, so you may want to rethink your practices, and hang on to the guests you still have, I personally do not plan on returning.",

Such an overall wonderful experience. The selection of steaks were great! I would definitely recommend the filet mignon Oscar style (crab cake topped with hollandaise sauce and asparagus on the side). Our waiter recommended a nice bottle of sweeter wine that definitely paired well with the steak. Great choice for a special occasion or even just a nice formal date night.",

    "text": "I think this restaurant tries hard to have a high end environment but the set up is uncomfortably open with little privacy. We got seated next to the most obnoxious family known to mankind. He was refused service because he was wearing a t-shirt and basketball shorts. He went and got clothes but left the tags on just to prove a point. They got a Caesar salad with every single topping separate and they had the server who is near close to retirement age bring them out hot, buttered plates at least 7 times. And to top it off, their kid was screaming bloody murder to where everyone in the restaurant could hear. They did nothing to stop their child's behavior. Inconsiderate dicks who don't care if they ruin other people's dinners or take up all of their server's time. But onto my food. The wait is what deters me from wanting to revisit again. Everything was a wait. My lobster bisque and crab cakes were sent out first and the salads took at least 20-25 mins to come out. My steaks came out after an hour of being there? Tables that got in after and ordered way after got their food before us. Dessert was the same, took about 30 mins to the point where I wanted to box it. I don't know about everyone else but I've got kids at home I'd rather be with than watching the aforementioned dick and his entitled behavior all night. At times like this, I could see servers wanting to spit in your food. I think there's a fine line between being a terrible human being and being particular. Whatever the case may be, you can see how much this neighboring table overshadowed my experience. Won't be re-visiting. I will say the manager handled that table with so much more class and respect than I could've. I work in a management role and watched her. Kudos to her!! I spent $250 here, Had a way better experience at Eddie V's and steak 44 for similar money.",

    "text": "Last time we were here was 2015 and it was excellent, 2 yrs. makes a difference. We were a party of 3 for a Saturday 7:15 reservation. The service remained the same along with the atmosphere. The food preparation the same (love the hot sizzling butter on everything), but the quality of steak seemed of a lower standard and the clientele very varied. When I'm sitting inside a fine dining, dining room and the guy at the table next to us is wearing shorts and an old t-shirt and sneakers and and on the other side a crying baby that the parents are ignoring and I'm paying $52 for a steak and dropping well over $200 on the bill I find it inexcusable.  Our server Jesse was excellent. We ordered cocktails while deciding the menu. I had the Tomato Blue Crab Soup appetizer. Entrees ordered was 2 New York Strip Steaks, Blue Crab Cakes and an order of Shoe String Fries and for dessert a complementary Anniversary celebration Apple Cheese Cake. The soup was delicious, only comment is that an Ice COLD Spoon should not be given with hot soup. The Crab Cakes, Fries and Steaks all prepared perfectly and again the quality of steak seemed a bit dry, not thick and juicy as our previous visit.  Will we be back again? Probably, but I will request NOT being seated next to any babies.",

Wait staff and managers took it in stride; ...wonder how many times this happens in a month?  Doesn't bode well for ambiance.   So for the food. \"Ok\". Honestly, the steak was just OK (filet,rare) with a couple of stringy grizzled veins throughout. Really? I would expect better from Ruth's Chris. Ok, 500deg sizzle plate; more brand that sizzle unfortunately. The shrimp were a little dry and overcooked, and the presentation a little messy.  In all, something I can make at home without much fuss, and I would like to have enjoyed the date night out with a little more pleasantry (don't bother the bar tender - he doesn't like people unless they are his friends). :o(  Burger was good, but we expected better.

The bathrooms were dated and slightly dirty. Walking in I thought oh no, this place is living off past glory. After we were seated our server disappeared for an extended period of time. We finally got our drinks and all was right with the world for a while. Our order came out and one of the dishes was sea bass and it was supposed to be shrimp. They took the fish back and about 10 minutes later the shrimp came out. The server offered zero concessions and only said \"I cannot read my own handwriting\". Seriously ? At a fine dining establishment, you cannot read your writing? And then not to at least offer a glass of wine? Bad form Kenny. The sea bass was delicious. The lobster Mac and Cheese was elementary and tasteless - like Kraft Mac and cheese with lobster on top. Brussel sprouts were decent, but nothing to get excited about. The late arriving shrimp was flavorful. The chicken dish had the worst presentation I have ever seen at a restaurant - seriously it looked ugly. The chicken had a good flavor, but looked like a 5th grader prepped the plate. I would give the food 3.5 stars, restaurant decor and bathrooms 1 star, and the service a 1.5 stars. Mark my words - Ruth's Chris will not survive. Like the T-Rex before it - they have not evolved / adapted so they will surely perish. Please try Steak 44, Mastro's Steak House, or Dominick's Steakhouse instead of wasting your money on this dinosaur.",

    "text": "I was in town for business, hungry as hell after traveling in from the East Coast and on my own for dinner so a walk to dine at the Ruth's Chris bar seemed like a really good idea.  It was.  The RC chain typically does a nice, consistent job no matter the city you're in and the Scottsdale version was no exception.  The 5 stars started with Kaylee the awesome bartender - shout out to Shelby, NC - ;-)  She was personable, on top of everything and clearly had a great relationship with all the servers, bussers, etc. in the place.  A True pro.   I ordered a cup of lobster bisque which was delish and featured a nice quantity of lobster meat.  Next came a Caesar salad and the anchovies offered as an addition gave a nice salty punch to the already outstanding dressing.  Finally, a perfectly medium-rare, thick and juicy NY Strip served on one of those signature sizzling RC plates.     Return visit on another trip to Scottsdale?  No hesitation.",

    "text": "My family and I went to Ruth's Chris for Good Friday dinner this year. With a party of 17 I'm sure we were no picnic to take care of, but it ended up being the most perfect dining experience! We had two servers, Ken and Adam, and they did an AMAZING job! The service was professional and fast, and the waiters had unlimited patience for my vegetarian diet. Ken was totally the Godfather of Ruth's Chris menu, he knew EVERYTHING and was very attentive. Adam waited on the other half of the table, so we didn't get get chat, but my brother and I talked him into jumping into a photo with us at the end, he was a cool guy and a great waiter as well!   The food itself was on a whole new level. My boyfriend and my brother both had the Cowboy Steak, which was HUGE. They haven't stopped talking about how delicious it was for the past week. Grandma had the Chilean Sea Bass, which she said was cooked to perfection. Being a vegetarian I ordered the side item platter with asparagus with hollandaise, creamed spinach, and sweet potato casserole. All of my sides were absolutely perfect, and the casserole was so good I could have easy eaten ten more bowls.   Dessert was even better (if that's even possible!) I had the Creme Brulee, which I was reluctant to share with Aunt Barb, because it was so darn good! My boyfriend had the Chocolate Sin Cake, which I'm fairly certain was sent from the gods above.   Overall it was an absolutely splendid dining experience and I would recommend Ruth's Chris to anyone! (Definitely try the sweet potato casserole)",

We had a great dinner last night, the lobster and steak were both great! Service was wonderful and they were very attentive and help make our experience so nice.  I am very mindful that Scottsdale is causal and laid back when it comes to the dress code, however this is a fine dinning concept and I wish the management would enforce a dress code. While nearly everyone In there last night was dressed nice and appropriately for restaurant, their were a few guys who wore t shirts and dip flops and were dressed more appropriately for the taco stand on beach not a fine dinning restaurant. Ruth Chris has great food and wonderful ambiance and the management should enforce a dress code. Other than that it's a great place and always a great experience.",

I smiled and said yes it is thank you. And she walked away. Which is when I realized we were the ONLY table she approached the entire time we were there. She passed by a couple more times but in the time that we were there I never saw her ask anyone else how everything was.  I don't want to think it was racial profiling but after that I felt uncomfortable. (Maybe next time she should try to be a little less conspicuous).

My fiance and I had dropped in without a reservation and were offered patio or bar which was perfectly fine (we had no expectation of being seated in the dining room).  But after not even being acknowledged let alone offered a drink after 10 minutes by wait staff that I could reach out and touch was too much for the money.  We proceeded down the road to Mastro's Ocean Club and had a wonderful meal and a wonderful time.  I'm sure if we were in the dining room it would have played out better.  And I'm certain we'll be back to Ruth's Chris, but with all the fine dining options in Scottsdale, I probably won't take a chance on the Scottsdale location again.",

    "text": "Ruth's is the best steak house in my opinion. My steaks have always been spot-on correct and the service the same. I am a real fan of their \"porterhouse for two\". And for this quality, I don't care about the price.  If you, like me, are a veggie fan, beware their steamed veggies are one tiny step away from raw. So I don't recommend steamed veggies as a side, try something that has to be cooked fully, like mashed potatoes. You can request that your veggies be truly cooked instead of raw and hot. When I had broccoli it was so hard that when my fork finally cut thru the stalk it hit the plate so hard and loud that people nearby looked at my table thinking I had broken a plate or shot someone.  I would make one suggestion to the staff: I come there for a somewhat intimate and top-notch dining experience. So leave me (us) alone. We did not come there to meet you, I came there for a good meal and to talk with the person I arrived with. If there's a problem I will let you know (but it has never happened). I don't want the manager coming to my table to introduce himself, especially when I have a mouth full of steak. If I wanted to be entertained, I'd eat at that oriental place that prepares your food at the table.",

    "text": "I've been to this place numerous times over the years and most recently last night. They've done a bit of remodeling and raised the prices, but I'm afraid the quality has gone down. Where's the quality control? They got my steak wrong twice - very wrong in fact. We both asked for the Fillet cooked Medium to Medium-well... we got one fillet cooked properly, and in front of me was a tiny little overcooked dry hunk of meat. They gave me the petite and cooked it beyond well done.   Since we had already filled up on bread and whatnot while waiting for our steaks, we just decided to split the correct steak. They took the other one away and gave me a sizzling hot empty plate. They also offered to make a new steak for us to take home for free to make up for it. We almost turned it down, but figured since we had half the bottle of wine to get through it might be done by the time we were ready to leave. They brought out a new one less than 2 minutes later. He said 'luckily we had one back there for you.' I'd suspect it to be my original order, but too much time had passed for it to be that. Plus, this one was undercooked - pretty much rare. We didn't want to say anything since it was free and we felt like complainers at this point.   The service was pretty shitty at first - for the first hour actually. We were ignored and forgotten. We weren't dressed like homeless people or anything either. When we weren't being ignored, we were having our order screwed up. Then they spent the rest of the night trying to make up for it. It's as though they just expect to suck and then when customers get mad about it, they kiss ass. Maybe it's a new rich people fad I don't know about. Going out somewhere to pay a lot and get crap service so you can have a reason to complain to someone and have someone suck up to you.   Hell, if it isn't a fad, I want to make it one. Maybe I'll open a store that sells expensive crap - then when they try to buy it, I'll be rude and mean to them until they are about to give up - then I'll just let them take the stuff home for free and smooch their butts until they feel good about themselves. But I digress...  It took forever to get our food ordered, then forever again to get it delivered. We sat at the bar because they were too busy to seat us. It was funny watching the two bartenders run around like they were working a packed night club when there were actually only about 5 people seated at the bar including us.  I think I've been let down by this place as many times as I've been pleased. And I keep going back because of the shrimp and the sizzling steak plates and the one or two really amazing steaks I've eaten there... truth is though, I cook a much better steak at home - hell, I could buy a new barbecue, gas tank, a novelty apron, tongs, 5 bottles of wine, an oven mitt, and 10 steaks for the same price as going to this place 5 times (with someone and paying for us both)...   I still think it's a decent steakhouse - pretty much overpriced - but good. I prefer this place to the other expensive steak chains, but there's some new ones that I haven't been to yet. Perhaps Ruth's Chris's era is coming to an end...  Another thing worth noting - half the people there had silver hair and the other half only had half their hair. There was a hanging portrait of some old lady dressed in red - probably Ruth (or Chris?) - that we had to stare at while we ate. Some actual old lady wearing red stopped near the picture to grab some mints and wait for her slow-ass husband. We were very amused at the likeness.",

Had a cold beverage that was COLD and hit the spot!  Then my wife ordered the Chopped Salad and I ordered the Calamari.  The salad was great, the calamari had some Asian chili and sweet blend that was just OK?  I guess I was expecting a more traditional calamari.  The bread was OK, little to crusty form my taste,  for you bread aficionados!  I had a 16 oz ribeye, medium rare, and she ordered a petite fillet and we shared the sweet potato casserole and asparagus with Hollandaise sauce.  I'm a big eater and the steak was perfect and way more than I should have ordered.  Great flavoring.  The petite fillet was perfect and my wife said it was the best she ever had and she has had many!  The sweet potato casserole was to  die for...it would have been a great dessert with some vanilla ice cream!!!  The bar ambiance was OK, couple of TVs so we got our sports fix, and an apparently active hot spot though I will get reservation next time.  The service was excellent, attentive, timely, and a tall gentleman that I assumed was the manager stopped by the table to see how we enjoyed our meal.  Overall it was a little pricey but is a great splurge.  What would have made this a 5 star instead of 4?  I would not have gotten the calamari and more yummy bread.  I like Ruth Chris so I would likely go back... and make a reservation!",

    "text": "Ruth's Chris had always been one of my favorite chain steak houses.   I love my filet mignons rare, and RC has always delivered.  Imagine my surprise when on this visit, my rare filet looked like a medium-to-well-done and my girlfriend's medium-rare only had a hint of pink in the center.  Now, I am not such a food snob to send things back to the kitchen, but this time the disparity between what was ordered and delivered was too much.  Within 5 minutes, the kitchen came back with a perfectly cooked rare steak.  Not only that, both the manager and the head chef (Craig) came to serve it themselves!  What personal service!  Now, many places serve a rare steak that's cold in the center.  Chef Craig calls this a \"black-and-blue\" steak.  The steak I received was the most perfectly cooked rare I have ever received: seared on the outside, pink on the edges and warm but red in the center.  Mistakes happen.  I believe the GREAT restaurants reveal themselves in how they resolve these situations.  (Also, I feel Steven's review is a bit harsh : Ruth's Chris's trademark is the buttery steak on a sizzling hot plate.  Kobe beef, which is by definition a fattier cut, may not work well for this.  The leaner filet is the cut of choice here.)",

    "text": "Alright folks....I can say I don't give two stars unless they 'earned' them.   I will have to say this is the first time I have had the opportunity to experience what I once considered one of the best steak houses in the country. I will have to say I was extremely let down. :(   I have been a server at some of the top notch places around. Of course you are going to think, \"well, she used to be a server, so she is going to rate a bit more harsh...\" Not so much from this little lady. I always appreciate how great most servers are....not judge them based on tiny mistakes are mistimings. Okay, with that said here goes...   Food was amazing....(if you are on a diet, head straight for the veggie platter) If this was solely based on food, five stars! Thank you to the chefs and kitchen staff!   Service.....horrible. I was celebrating my boyfriend's business partner's retirement party. I will have to say that our table was a 14 top, however 4 of the group were 11, 5, 4, and 3 years of age. The tab was also prepaid by the retiree's boss. Large table +prepaid tab+kids+auto gratuity=horrible service. This doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out.  I had two glasses of wine and a glass of desert wine. I will have to say without a stopwatch in tow or in use, I will easily say it took her more than 15 minutes to hit the service bar to grab my glass of wine. This server had more than enough assistance and the bar was DEAD. I would totally understand if the service bar was behind or I ordered some really strange drink that required a special ingredient that the bartender had to go and get, but I was ordering 'by the glass' wine that was FEATURED on the menu. My second complaint about the service is that when a customer or 'guest' orders a glass of Pinot Noir, you don't automatically assume they want the most expensive glass on the menu. Prepaid or not, I know what I like and if the wine menu is MIA then when I say Pinot Noir chose a glass middle of the road. If I want $14 a glass Pinor Noir I will call it by name. This was NOT Victoria's fault. This was done by a gentleman that was of first assistance.   Service cont....Soups and Salads were not ordered properly and put in the wrong positions at the table. Sides were also not placed on the table in front of the person that ordered that item to compliment their entree. My boyfriend's steak was medium as opposed to mid-rare. This is easily fixed by asking for a re-fire but at the time, it was extremely tasty, and at that point in service, why interrupt.   Service cont...I was basically done with dessert by the time Victoria was able to bring my glass of dessert wine. I ordered a glass of dessert wine that compliments chocolate. Too bad I had to stare at my chocolate until my glass of wine arrived. She pulled the whole, my help was running around here trying to figure out where it belonged. Yeah, I wasn't born yesterday....she forgot to order it.   Okay, enough with the service. The ambiance was impeccable. We had our own, private dining area. Dinner service started at six and we finished up around 9. We had very young children at the table that were incredibly well behaved. I had just met his daughter and her three small children. They didn't act up what so ever. I appreciate being placed in a private dining area. Major thumbs up to mgmt and everyone involved in making it a special evening.   The management was actively involved in service as they checked on our table at least three times and offered if they could assist in any way. Had the service not been so mistimed and sloppy I could have easily scored Ruth's Chris at five stars.   I am more than excited to come back and try again as everyone has bad nights and can be a little off.",

    "text": "I don't know whether my taste has gotten more demanding or Ruth's Chris has declined. My husband and I went recently, the first time in at least 5 years. While the ribeye and filet mignon were good, they weren't great. And both were drowned in salt - his with grease (butter?) and mine with the Au Poivre sauce. Yuck! Also, my \"medium rare\" ribeye was slightly overdone, pretty disappointing for a steakhouse. His tempura onion rings were laden with grease and yes, more salt. My spinach au gratin was divine, although probably salt-laden too, just less noticeable. The calamari appetizer was excellent and so were the cheesecake and bread pudding desserts. But for $240 (including 1 glass of wine each), we could have had a far better meal in many other places in Scottsdale or Phoenix. It will be a whole lot longer than 5 years before we go again.",

I have dined at this local, Las Vegas, Nv for my wedding reception in March 2008, and also for a lunch as well as the San Diego harbor location for a New Years Eve Dinner..  If you don't like top quality meats or haven't had them, I defy anyone to find a better steakhouse.. You are paying for the steaks which are served on their signature 500 degree plates with sizzling butter.. I always go for the NYer, a side of creamed spinach..   I have never had a bad service or had to complain about my food. Trust me, I will make my displeasure known, professionally and courteously. You always get more flies with honey than vinegar.   The food at Ruth's Chris is top notch. Sorry to hear about the other reviewers birthday problem. A call to the location and a talk with the general manager would have done wonders the next day..",

The gripe I have with our last visit is the 30 minutes we waited for our table during the holiday. For our party of 7 we made sure to have the reservation set long in advance and so we were unhappy to wait uncomfortably in the bar area for the previous party to clear out and our table to be set. It isn't unreasonable to expect some sort of apology (read: freebie) when a large party comes in and has to stand in a cramped area for half an hour, but no such accommodation was made.   ---------  tl;dr Good food, good service, poor reservation management from hostesses and uncomfortable waiting area.",

After few min, the manager of the restaurant with the waiter came to apologized and then the head chef came out himself with our new filet mignons and fresh side dishes.  He took his time to converse with us for at least 20min and thanked us for our understanding that things like this happen sometimes with new chefs in training.  *Filet Mignon = wonderful *Service = exceptionally great *Atmosphere = very relaxing and classy.",

(+) One of the finest Filet Mignon steaks you're going to eat, brought out to you sizzling in butter. *drool* (+) Order the Barbecue Shrimp appetizer. Trust me. Just order it. (+) Order the Stuffed Mushroom appetizer too. What, you'll have no room for steak? Dude, make room! Splurge! (+) Attentive, professional staff. You won't want for anything. They'll serve and clear on the proper side of the table. They'll place your dessert spoon horizontal to you. You know, all the fancy details. (+) Yes, that table bread is delicious, and you'll need it to sop up the sauce that the Barbecue Shrimp came in. ...You did order it, right? (+) Great wine selection. And they're honest with their recommendations too (unlike some restaurants that will say anything about a bottle of wine if they think it'll help sell it). (+) If you come here on your birthday, they'll sprinkle confetti all over their fancy white table cloth...just for you. Feel special. (+) No room for dessert? Yeah, you're gonna have to order the Creme Brulee anyway. Really. (-) Super spendy (...for mortals like me anyway). Makes this a special occasion sort of place; but you'll be well satisfied when you do go.",

He was very knowledgeable and friendly.  We started off with a couple glasses of Moscato (yes, a dessert wine but I love it anytime!).  The bread and butter was very delish.  We ordered the tempura onion rings for an appetizer... I thought they were okay.  The onion and batter were too thick for my liking but the hubs enjoyed them.  I ordered the filet w/ 6 shrimp and a side of potatoes au gratin.  Hubs ordered the BBQ shrimp and the fries.  My food was AMAZING... the steak came out sizzling and was melt in your mouth yummy as were the potatoes.  I LOVE those potatoes.  The hubs raved about his BBQ shrimp.  For dessert we had the chocolate molten cake.  AND THAT WAS GREAT!  It was a huge piece of cake with vanilla ice cream on top, drizzled with caramel.    All in all... a FANTASTIC meal!  We left with full bellies and some leftover for later.  I'm a fan and will definitely be back!",

I arrived early so I sat at the bar and ordered some calamari(see pics)  PJ the bartender took very good care of me, he was funny without being obnoxious, we watched jeopardy together and he knew all the answers, he even gave me a wine tasting tour of the most expensive wines they have! I found a new favorite.(Whitehall Lane Cabernet) He was great company while I waited for my guests to arrive.  Thanks PJ~  Dinner was Delicious as usual, although I did notice they increased their prices a bit.  I ordered Shrimp Cocktail, Ruth's Chop salad, Seared Scallops and the broccoli augratin. (see pics) I really don't care for red meat anymore but their Rib-eye is Delicious if your a steak eater.  My guests ordered the filet and crab legs, tomato salad, house salad and a rib-eye and they loved every bite as well.  After dinner we relaxed for a bit on their patio complete with fireplace and the most comfy patio chairs I've ever sat in (see pics)  I spent nearly a $100 on my dinner alone but it was worth every delectable bite~",

Jared had been to this location but neither me or Zack had - we were actually really impressed!  We were all dressed casually and the hostesses didn't judge us.  We chose to sit outside since it was a beautiful night, and our team of waiters (Greg and John) took really good care of us.  We were drinking water like crazy and went through two bread baskets right off the bat.  The three of us split two bone in rib eye steaks and the signature tomato onion salad, steamed spinach, and sweet potato casserole... The waiters cut the salad and steaks up per our request.  As we were eating, the manager, Stacia, came to check on us which is always a nice touch!  We had nothing to complain about either - the steak was tender and delicious, the sides went well with it too.    The meal before tip came to $135 but luckily we had a $50 off Amex coupon, so it wasn't too crazy expensive.

The salad had been sitting in the cooler for a couple of days - the wilted greens, tomatoes and red onions were a dead giveaway. The roasted corn was supposed to have jalapenos in it, but the dish appeared and tasted like it came out of a can. Potato gratin was undercooked, with potatoes cut a little too big. Creminis appeared to have been cooked ahead of time, sitting in their black juice, which tells me it wasn't freshly prepared. Like I said, the steaks were awesome, which we expected. What we didn't expect was the questionable service, and the sad, overpriced sides. The creme brulee was completely half-assed, with sugar crystals that never quite melted. Not worth the price. I think people go to Ruth's Chris for a good steak, and to have a great experience. Unfortunately, the only good thing about this place was the steak.",

This time it seemed like Atlantic farmed salmon, did not look or taste wild-caught.  It was tender and edible but had very little flavor. I didn't ask the source, but found some other comments on line by other diners disappointed that it wasn't wild-caught.  Friend ordered steak, and he reported it to be quite ordinary but good.  The mashed potatoes are nothing special.  Won't eat there again at these prices.  There are restaurants with better food at half the price.",

My husband and I had our rehearsal dinner there and except for a small hiccup (my father-in-law had said we could NOT go over 2 hours, without exception, and our dessert had been held up because my hubby and I were giving our bridal party gifts and speeches and the staff didn't want to interrupt so we never got our dessert .... it was promptly removed from my in-laws' bill without question or hesitation), the service, food, and atmosphere was amazing.  We, along with the in-laws, dealt solely with Chelsea Helstab (sales and catering manager) and she couldn't have been more responsive. The wait staff that night was so on-point .... available whenever we needed them, refilling drinks quickly, yet never seemed to be hovering or there \"too much\".  It's pricey but for a special event like this? You can't go wrong.",

The carpets are very visibly dirty and that's just the start. 3 of the people at my table wanted to order the surf & turf but unfortunately they were out of lobster. Very disappointing. They left my water glass empty for 30 minutes. They didn't bring our wine out with dinner as requested. Had to ask for it(again) On the positive end we were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation at 6:30. I was going to get a manager and complain but all they would offer is some money off the bill or some lame excuses. We still took very good care of our water tipping 30%. It wasn't deserved, but it is Christmas after all. We'll be going to Morton's in the future. Skip this place. It's not worth the price.",

    "text": "Thanksgiving was an extreme disappointment (to put it very mildly and try to be fair). Their Thanksgiving three course meal would have been a great price for $39.95, however the food was not hot, the turkey, side dishes and dessert were very average, they crowded the restaurant with additional seating and couldn't serve everyone properly. Apparently the food was just sitting at the pass waiting for the wait staff, because each of our courses took a VERY long time to be served, and when we did get it, everything was barely warm. We actually spoke up, for my mother, and asked them to bring her a new side dish of mashed potatoes, because she described them as cold. After a VERY long wait again, the new casserole of potatoes were the same temperature as before (and as all of ours). If I had been at home, I never would have eaten any of the food this cold. The dessert was described as \"Pumpkin Cheesecake,\" however it was a \"cafeteria-like\" mixture somewhat like a pumpkin mousse (however that term is too generous), with pecans mixed into the mash, (no crust), that tasted very mass produced. What was even more of a sign of their substandard attention was that we waited 20\" after they had cleared our dinner plates, before they brought the round scoops (\"cheesecakes\") -- some of which had whipped cream (nickle-size dollops) on top and some that didn't. By that time, it really felt like we had gone to a cheap smorgasborg. A couple of my other family members had chosen a different 3 course menu option: squash soup, filet mignon, a side, and apple crumb pie (for $59.95). Of course, their soups and sides were cold as well, and the \"apple crumb pie\" was also just a blob of similar unidentifiable mash that contained diced apple chunks and some apple crumb. (The two desserts were actually so indistinguishable that they were served to the wrong people, and no one could even tell.) It is unfortunate how a very disappointing family holiday dinner experience can ruin our opinion of their reputation. We had always enjoyed dining at Ruth's Chris and felt that they were a fine alternative to Capital Grill, Fleming's, Mastro's, or Dominick's (with different pros & cons). We have spent two or three anniversaries at Ruth's Chris, and they made them special with the sprinkled table decorations, rose, and photo. However, after spending $551.78 (wine, drinks, tip incl.), for this last experience which was DEFINITELY NOT worth the price, I don't believe that we will ever return, especially since there are so many other wonderful alternatives for fine steak, special sides, excellent service and much better ambiance.",

    "text": "I didn't think there could be another steak house that is just as good as Durant or a Different Point of View until now.   The restaurant is located at the 2nd floor of a plaza and I believe it was relocated from camelback a year ago. The exterior is not much to look at. However, the interior is beautifully decorated. Hostesses were friendly & well dressed. The tables are well layout with different plates, folks & knives (talk about elegant). Our waiter showed up shortly after we were seated introducing us their menus & different variety of drinks. It took my 2nd try to actually like the white wine that I picked. Not once he gave me any sort of an attitude and was being extremely patient with me finding the right wine to go with the meal. When we were ready to order the entree, he highly recommended me to order the filet mignon. My friend ordered the chef special with a lobster Mac & Cheese. There was a bit of a wait to get our meals & our waiter never stopped keeping us posted on the progress. When the plates finally arrived, they were still hot until I had my last bite. The portion was just right for me and it was juicy and delicious. Nevertheless, it didn't taste nearly as good as the chef special. It was well seasoned with big portion. Every bite has a lot of flavor in it. I was extremely full, but still manage to make room for desserts. I ordered the ice-cream with two different flavor (vanilla and chocolate) & a cheese cake. It was a perfect way to end the meal. If you like coffee with liquor in it, they have them on the menus also.   We walked out of here feeling full and happy. It was definitely a romantic setting for a date night. Food was great and service was outstanding. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try a nice steak and date night.   P.S. I really wish they would have prime rib in their menu. I guess I'll have to go to Durant for that. Side dishes are not included with your entree. Be prepared to spend some serious $$$ here.",

The salad was very good; the chicken sandwich was just okay. I wouldn't say it was cold, but I got the sense that it was left out for a bit. The mojito was a bit too tart for my taste. There were some other things on the menu that seem appetizing, so I haven't given up on the food just yet. I really enjoyed the views and happy hour pricing so I will visit again.",

    "text": "I have to admit, the view of the restaurant from the parking lot is a bit saddening and the red carpet to the elevator is pretty tacky. But the real star here is the food! If you want a good deal, come during AZ Restaurant Week for a 3 course meal. The roasted tomato & crab soup had a little kick to it that elevated the dish. Their steaks are very flavorful, most likely stemming from the fact that they're cooked in butter. We tried their filet mignon and petite ribeye, both of which were delicious. Their sides are normal, nothing to complain about here. I prefer this place over Capital Grille.",

We did go for happy hour, and they weren't that busy, but the medium rare hamburger came out well done, and the server never returned to see if we needed anything, so one of the guests went up to the hostesses and told what happened. The gal said when I see your server, I'll let her know!  But after about 4 more minutes, he returned to the desk and asked for the manager. She came to the table promptly, picked up the well done burger, and apologized.  She returned in about 3 minutes with a burger that was cooked to perfection.  The bartender did a great job on a lemon drop! However, the chefs must have wanted to be outside playing because the sliced filet was pre-cooked, and dry, and the fries were soggy.  The Manager did all she could to make it a pleasant evening after the first mess up...Too bad her staff isn't as efficient as the Manager.  She was great!  We may go back, just to be on the gorgeous patio, but then again, maybe not so soon!",

    "text": "I dined at Ruth's Chris with my boyfriend and his parents with a reservation on a Saturday night. Once we were \"checked in\" at the front they seat us in a small dining room to the left with maybe 6 total tables.  Our server Jason seemed as if he was super nervous and white-knuckling it through the evening.  For drink orders he starts with me?  I'm not the guest of honor as well as I'm the least senior at the table. When I'm not ready to order he nicely comes back to me after the other 3 decide.  *What we ordered*  Appetizers: BBQ shrimp- awesome sauce  Calamari- sweet chili sauce we request on the side  Stuffed mushrooms  Salads & soups: Lobster bisque (yum!) Caprese (ok) Caesar salad French onion soup   Entrees & sides: All of us ordered petite filets Pomme frites Au gratin potatoes  Onions Mushrooms  Margaux (amazing wine! Which they decant table side)   Dessert: Chocolate duo Coffee  Our appetizers took forever to come out so much so that we started asking about them.  Also when our steaks come out they have 3 petite filets and one petite ribeye... They insisted we ordered it and then when my boyfriends dad said he'd be happy with it they now insist on bringing a filet out.  Also at this time his mom and I ask for forks twice before we can eat our steaks.  By dessert it is clear that Jason is sweating bullets and ready for his shift (life?) to be over.  When he places my coffee down his hand is shaking and the saucer is full of coffee.  We are all used to a great steak dining experience from Ruth's Chris but it was amateur night with no personality, slow timing, and mistakes left and right.   The food itself was decent but not strong enough to distract the awkward moments and lacking attention to detail.  Sitting in the small side room was dull and I guess easy to overlook by the staff.",

    "text": "Ruth's Chris is absolutely one of the best steak places around.   We came here for a family member's Birthday and love all the little things they did to make it special. Our Italian born server Francisco was both attentive and mildly amusing. He produced a mini LED flashlight at one point when one of us couldn't see the menu. LOL  We started with some wine, a fruit and rosemary flavored Martini, along with some salads and a beef Carpaccio (see photos). All were very good.  The Carpaccio came in the shape of a pineapple, with the most mild and flavorful parmigiano-reggiano cheese I've ever had. It was a good start.   We weren't rushed and our water glasses were topped off without any fuss. We sat near the back window, enjoying the view of the patio and McCormick-Stillman Park. There was a beautiful harvest-like moon over head.   For dinner we ordered the halfed Chicken, 16 oz Filet Mignon and the 22oz Cowboy Ribeye. All very very good, but my ribeye was undercooked. One of the servers took it away but it came back on the other side of medium, minus the table scraps for the pups. LOL  Ruth's Chris is famous for cooking their steaks in a 1800 oven, so the one thing you don't want to do is over cook it. I give them credit for offering me another steak, but I declined. They did insist however we allow them to buy us dessert, which we did accept. All in all, it was a good meal and we had a nice time. See the Birthday cakes photos.   Ruth's is at the high end of the steakhouse price point, so expect to pay $75 to $90 each, including taxes and gratuity.",

We got asparagus and lobster mac and cheese. They put some confetti on the table for our anniversary which was a cute touch. I had the lobster bisque to start and it was very good. Good size bowl as well. So why 4 stars and not 5? For this price I expect perfection. The steaks were ordered medium and mine was medium well. No pink in the middle. It was so very tender and flavorful that I didn't mind that much but it was overcooked. The lobster mac and cheese was not hot. It was room temperature barely. And it really wasn't that good. Everything else was amazing and the service was perfect. The grilled asparagus is fantastic and the best I have had.",

Yes, the menu is a la carte (a.k.a. pricey, a.k.a. expensive, a.k.a. overpriced). Yes, the service is impeccable. Yes, they have a great patio.   BUT...the food is average. And when I say average, I'm talking about the kind of average a teacher will stick a + on just to make the parent think their kid ain't so bad.  You can find the same menu at less expensive places and probably have more room at your table.  For you vegetarians who find yourselves eating at RC with the carniv's, don't bother getting the vegetarian plate (market price). You'll only make yourself angry. I suggest you spend dollars on a baked potato side ($10), then convince one of the carniv's that they need some veggies with their cut of carcass. You know they won't finish all, so you can swoop in to help them out.  The best plate was the dessert. It's worth the sawbuck I paid. As far as the meal, I relied on filling up with table bread and completely underwhelming, tasteless, oily veggies.  Unfortunately I didn't try a salad, but from what I could see at other tables, they looked all right.",

Basically, it is expensive and does not deliver the value we expect today.  The main shortcoming is the food.  There is nothing wrong with it exactly, except an apparent belief that seasonings are evil.  But there is not enough right.  To be sure, the portions are large and the ingredients fresh and of good quality.  But for the prices they charge you expect more than a steak broiled in butter or a salad with greens and radish slices and little else.  You expect imagination, innovation, bold flavors, attractive presentation -- in short, a little pizazz.  There is no pizazz here.    Now if all you want is a plain steak, ordinary creamed spinach, simple potatoes, and a common salad, Ruth's Chris is your place.  Otherwise you will enjoy the meal but hate the check.",

    "text": "this is the third time i have made a reservation  this year for a large party.  every time we have made the reservation  you must ask.   Do you have Lamb? or do you have Filet mignon.  Every time they don't have the food on the menu.  How embarrassing when you take out a party of twelve only for an anniversary that ruth Chris steakhouse doesn't have steak or prime rib or Lamb,  that we can have chicken?  Their excuse is that they ran out , or  they are stopping carrying LambChops. and the third was  the cattle that were  shipped was bad.  they get you in then have you order  something else  than what you went to the restaurant for. The first 2 times i thought OK  but this is the third time.  don't you think they should have someone ordering enough food?  the manager whom is a lady was very rude and could care less.",

Nice as ever. The two Davids were our servers. Soooo nice. Recommended the chefs selection over a LA carte and saved us 65$. Unheard of. We aren't first time steak house eaters so it was a shock to hear a waiter recommend spending less money.    So the food. I got the lobster bisque to start. Awesome. Then the 16 oz. Rib eye medium. Wow wow wow. Seriously, no lie. Better then the 33 oz. Bone in rib eye at mastros and 35$ less. Comes out on a 500 degree platewith butter sizzling. For my fiancee she got the petite filet with shrimp. Soo good and iI don't really care for small filets. We shared the lobster mac and cheese. Self explanatory. So much lobster 5 oz. Then the creamed spinach. And we shared the shrimp cocktail Zero complaints. And we are somewhat picky. Drinks were awesome. Strawberry basil giblet and for me my usual Jameson and ginger ale.    Dessert needs its own section. For me I try and get creme brulee anywhere I eat. This honestly tasted better than Mortons. She got the caramelized banana cream pie. Yea you read that right. The best ever.   So in finishing chose ruth Chris and ask for the Davids to serve you. We were going to j&g at the Phoenician but steered cleared after seeing the horrible reviews and only the view being good. Plus 400$ dinner thats ehhh vs Ruth Chris at 201$? Why go anywhere else. Please take me serious I'm a 6'4\" 300 lb. Man. I've eaten. I don't ever write reviews but this place really stuck with me.",

But the flavor of the steaks OMG are amazing. It so tender and buttery have you ever cut room temperature butter with a knife yeah that's the same ways this steak cuts! And just melts in your mouth with flavor and juiciness!   It was a great night the service was top notch, we went with his recommendations for selecting wines and dessert. It was a really great experience for the special occasion you can't go wrong here if you are True Steak-Snob!",

I chose the blue cheese walnut salad- super!! and the creamed spinach was earthy tasting.  we ordered the lobster mac, and first try it was room temp, with cold bits of lobster.  second try they brought it out piping hot. it was pretty boring though,  even with the green chile in it. the sides were plentiful,  enough for at least 3 people to share.  end of meal came with the turtle cheesecake. it wasn't anything special.  all in all, it was very average! definitely nothing special. wouldn't go back.",

He had swordfish that was the best he has ever had,  with a side of mashed potatoes that were good.  I had a filet topped with shrimp.  Very flavorful.

My husband and I have been going here for anniversaries/special occasions since we have been married (in 2008), and every experience has been amazing. It really is the best food I have ever eaten. We both start with the Caesar salads which include the most delicious croutons and shaved Parmesan ever. My husband always orders a ribeye which is perfect and I get the stuffed chicken breast with lemon butter and garlic herb cheese. AMAZING. The huge sides are always delicious as well. Our favorites include the potatoes au gratin, shoestring fries, and green beans or garlic mashed potatoes. For dessert you can't go wrong with their homemade cheesecake and chocolate almond bark. We always look forward to our next visit!",

First, we were constantly having to ask for water to be refilled. Then the waitress proceeded to spill a glass of water all over our table and didn't even clean it up. We used our own napkins to clean up the spill ourselves, then when she finally reappeared we had to ask her for new napkins not once but twice which seemed to be a trend with her for the evening. We were constantly asking her for things multiple times. When our food finally came out, the plates were distributed to the wrong people. Overall, for the prices that we paid for the meal, the experience made it less than worth it.",

The cocktails are off the hook; and the delectable creamed spinach is an essential on the side. \"Ruth's Chris\" is one of those must-once-a-year occasions, it's expensive, but a necessary splurge for any True steak lover.

Cocktails aren't particularly exciting or strong, but a great wine selection makes up for it. Best way to describe the experience, 'consistent'. Great service, tasty steak. Highly recommend the filet or the filet with shrimp. The sides are huge portions, so keep that in mind when ordering.  The au gratin potatos where thick and creemy and loaded with melted cheese on top - which makes anything that much better!  The service is very attentive - even for a large group.  Sometimes this was a drawback or tunr-off when you are having a convesations and constantly being fawned over by service staff.  If I ever do go back to that location - I will want to take advantage of the outdoor patio area with fire pit and enjoy the Arizona night.",

    "text": "Ruth's is easily in my top 5 favorite steak houses.  I've been to Ruth's about a dozen times in my life and it is always fantastic.  I know it is a huge chain and we are supposed to hate them but I don't care.  I would eat there every night if I could.  Sadly, neither my wallet or arteries can afford it.  My reservation for 5 was at 8pm last night and the place was pretty dead.  It didn't matter though because we had a super- special VIP private dining room.  I was poking around their website and found that they have several private dining rooms.  So naturally I NEEDED to have one.  I shot the Scottsdale private dining contact (Michelle) an email to inquire about the possibility of getting their \"Ruth's Room\" which is their smallest (5-10 people) room.  She responded and told me it was available and would waive the food and beverage minimums which was nice because I didn't even know there were any.  The only thing they forced upon me was a mandatory 20% tip which I normally do anyway so it wasn't a big deal.  Anyway, I provided her all the details (size of party, time, reason for our visit, etc.) all over email so the whole thing went smoothly.  The private room was excellent and well...private.  We closed the door and curtains as to not bother anybody and had a good ole' time.  It is not that we are rowdy or talking about top secret stuff, it was just nice to not have to worry about other people around.  Not that it mattered because the place wasn't too crowded.  Anyway,  I would highly recommend getting the private room if you have a party of 5 or more.   The service was good but not the best.  I could tell they all just wanted to go home or upset that we weren't super big spenders.  Plus I had to wait and had to ask for diet coke refills.  No bueno.  I was also pissed that I told them when I made the reservation that 2 friends in our party had just gotten engaged.  I figured they would send us a dessert with a candle in it or something.  Anyway, they didn't send anything or mention anything.  Oh well.  Guess they forgot.  The food:  * Bread the give you to start = they need to upgrade this.  Every other steak place has them beat in this area.  * BBQ Shrimp appetizer = very good  * Tuna appetizer = very good  * Wedge = eh  * Filet = excellent.  My wife and I split the 12oz..  It was cooked perfectly and was more than enough to share.  I forgot to order it with extra butter but I didn't really need it and my wife would have killed me.  The filet is all I have ever gotten at Ruth's.  Next time I'm going for the ribeye to try something different.  * Creamed Spinach = very good.  Ruth's does it the best.  * Lyonnaise Potatoes = This was my first experience with them.  They are just big french fries with some sauteed onions on top.  It was pretty random but pretty good.  Not sure I would order them again though.  I would probably just stick to regular fries.  All-in-all it was a good dinner.  Not perfect but very good.  I hope to come back soon.",

    "text": "Sunday, November 23. Went to Ruth's Chris Steak House for my Mother's birthday. She had been looking forward ordering the lobster tail. Cocktails and appetizers (Carpaccio and Calamari) everything was good. When dinner arrived the lobster tail was three tiny bites, two if your a big eater! I am aware that the menu is very pricey, the restaurant is very upscale dining, and I have no qualms paying. However $68.00 for a lobster tail that would not even be large enough for an appetizer for one person! Shame on you Ruth's Chris Steak House, and your Chef as well. A good waiter would have informed us that the lobster tail was a micro meal and made another recommendation. Now here's the kicker. My brother ordered the special, \"The Filet and TWO Twin Tails\", $48.95. The Filet was 4-6-oz (?) and the Lobster Tails were the same tiny size as my Mothers. My brother's dinner was nice for a reasonable price, but Mother left hungry and very disappointed. Dinner for 4 people, $383.65 not including the tip. In all fairness, we had recently dined at Ruth's Chris Steak House. Maybe 5-6 weeks ago. Francisco Torres was our server. We requested him again, however he was not scheduled until later that evening. He gave us excellent service, wonderful menu and wine suggestions. The meal that night was wonderful. We were looking forward to coming back. After this last disappointing experience I am having regrets.",

Deserts were amazing, the banana cream pie was to die for, the bread pudding wasn't bad either. Everything is half price, great friendly service, it's on a lovely terrace where you can watch the sunset...I'd go back anytime I'm down there.",

    "text": "We recently visited The Restraunt a few months ago. We are avid Ruth's Chris frequenters, but this was our first time at the Scottsdale location. Upon seating I quickly asked our waitress if she could take a picture of our table for my parents anniversary. Very rudely she replied \"we have someone that comes around to each table to take a picture so just wait for that\". Without skipping a beat she made her way to the table next to us which clearly appeared to be her regulars snapped their picture and chatted away. My father also cut himself on his glass slicing his lip, in which she nonchalantly   apologized and walked away to get a manger who apologized and brought another drink. After nearly an hour and a half I reminded the waitress I would like a picture for the anniversary and she rolled her eyes as she went to find someone to take the picture. My father kindly tipped the waitress 30% on our 375$+ meal and chalked it up to her having a bad day and not how the restaurant operates as a whole. Very disappointing for a special day.",

The food was great, the service was fantastic, and they kept the reservations.  It was an anniversary for us and they made it special.  It is everything you expect from a great high end chain.",

The filet's at Ruth Chris are boarderline magical. Jeanie was our waitress, and she was wonderful. Her wine recommendation was top notch, suggesting the pinot noir \"Duckhorn.\" Alex assisted her and he did an awesome job as well. Overall, just a great, professionally-relaxed dining experience.",

The dining experience was perfect, from beginning to end. I was reluctant to go there because I didn't have such a great experience at the one in LV. Glad we went & will definitely be back. :) thank Alejandro",

    "text": "Huh. I guess it's a love it or hate kind of place. Me? I love it. But put butter on a shoe and I might just kiss you. Oh butter, is there anything you can't do? Is there?  This is one of the high roller places in Scottsdale. I saw a guy take a wad of Benjis out of his pocket that seriously made me consider rolling him. But my boss might have objected. Damn boss.  It's all about service and steak here. And I'm down with that. We had crab legs for an appetizer. Quite nice for a land-locked state. Fresh and tasty. A tomato salad with sharp onion that I enjoyed. And shared a porterhouse the size of my... yes. My ass. If one could give a nice slap to a porterhouse, this would be quite a spankable piece of meat. I love the way you can hear your steak coming to your table in all it's sizzling glory. The first thing to hit your nose is the lovely perfume of the butter. Chanel # Yum. Then that aroma of the meat.   I know we had a couple of sides. But I honestly can't remember because the steak was so freaking perfect. To a corn-fed born and bred midwestern girl this is perfection.   The service is near perfect too. Our waitress gave us a wine selection for the steak that was spot on. Not too tanic. Not too tame. Held up nicely against the butter and the porterhouse. At the end of the meal I was I nearly unable to move. And that says a whole lot. I've been known to out eat grown men without batting an eye.   Oh, and if you don't like butter on your steak? Three words. \"Hold the butter.\" May save you some pain.",

My fillet was under cooked but they immediatly fixed the problem.  We had to wait 15 minutes for a table on a Monday night which was upsetting as they had one dining room empty and some open tables in the room we were in.  I've eaten here several times over the years during spring training and it's always been great.  The flavor was superb....",
