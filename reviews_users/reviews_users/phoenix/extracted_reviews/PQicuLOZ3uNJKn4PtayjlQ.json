I love the crinkle cut French fries they are my favorite type of fry if I had to chose any.   My food always comes out and cooked to perfection. My experience with the customer service has been great as well!",

It was good but I am not sure it would be something I would crave and have to come back to.",

I should've gotten a double patty.   Interior was clean, staff was friendly, parking was plentiful at mid afternoon. Outside area was decently shaded. They don't allow dogs but do have bowls of water outside where your dog can wait for a second while you order. They sell wine and beer. People drive like shit inside the plaza though. Lots of hipsters and cali-types as well. Would recommend to anybody.",

My Go-To is te Smoke Shack with everything except pickles (I don't like pickles on my burgers), a lemonade drink and bacon cheese fries! There's treating seating and again the customer service is just wonderful they're all so nice and very helpful and so kind. Even though I would consider shake shack to be a more \"high-end fast food chain\" their attitudes are so humble and warming. I've gone in after my 9:45pm class down town. (Keep in mind I'm a student who barely a gets sleep so I'm usually \"bumming it\") I don't feel judged or feel out of place since they are always so welcoming no matter what. It's honestly my one favorite places to eat after class or after work on Saturday.  Keep up the amazing work Shake Shack Crew!",

    "text": "First of all, for the multiple reviewers who've complained the burgers here are \"greszy\", and you know who you are, they're SUPPOSED to be greasy. Greasy IS juicy. Juicy is greasy.   This IS a good burger. Good, not great.  But the patty is too small. WAY TOO SMALL. WAAAAAAAAY TOO SMALL.   The counterhelp suggested I try the \"Smokeshack\".  This was a double burger with Neiman Ranch bacon with cheese,  chopped cherry peppers and ShakeSauce. Generous amount of bacon, the problem was the burger was made to look pretty for presentation but made for uneven flavor throughout the burger. There wasn't any ShakeSauce on the front half of the burger. Like Hopdoddy, I don't want to sacrifice flavor for appearance. Very uneven burger   Crinkle cut fries were fantastic!!  PERFECT.   Question for management: Why build a roof over the patio that allows rain to come through?!  I realize this is Phoenix and it doesn't occur often but it occurred yesterday and I didn't like it.   Cutest young woman working the counter added select customer services - did not catch her name but she was very observant and helpful.   So, at the end of the day, The Stand on Indian School Road serves \"The Standard, ($5.99 with cheese) and it's really good. It's  a double cheese really similar to the Shackshack.   Shakeshack charges $8.09 for a double cheeseburger, and therefore is 25% more. than The Stand. Why?  I mean really, Shakeshack is really, really OVERPRICED.   Here's the list of the preferred:  1) Lucky Boy 2) Harvey's (16th St location only) 3) The Stand 4) Zinburger  5) Red Robin  Bye for now!",

I've waited in loooong lines in Madison Square Park for those burgers.  When it came to Chicago I was thrilled. And loved that the lines were shorter.  Now that I'm in Phoenix I love that there's one nearby and the no crazy lines. I'm not sure why I used to wait in those lines, I think it was a bit of hype. But I'm a fan and it's a good fast casual burger. The shakes are pricey, especially the special flavors, but they're tasty.  We come here at least once a month, the employees are always friendly and II'm glad to have it in the hood.",

His choice was the cheeseburger, which just goes without saying. I got the chicken sandwich and their take on a Chicago-dog. I got him a 'large' soda at $2.80, and splurged on the cold-brew iced-coffee for me at $4.55. I can't recall the food costs, but with no fries nor shakes....total of $24.85.   His burger was sized akin to a single at In-N-Out, but certainly tasted better. However, the chicken sandwich was clearly the taste-winner here, we both agreed. Thankfully, it was also a bit larger than his tiny burger. The dog was well-prepped, with all fixin's in the right proportions so as not to overwhelm the link. But again, this was a pup, not a dog, LOL. The drinks were, perhaps, 12oz, at best. No worries for my bladder, here.   We rolled through the McD's on the way home, and got a value double-cheese and a spicy-chicken, because we were still hungry. That sums-it-up nicely.",

    "text": "Went to Shake Shack tonight.  I usually don't like corporate places, but I found Shake Shack on Yelp and didn't realize it was the same one I heard about on the internet.   The pictures on yelp looked good, so I decided to try it out. When I got there, I realized it was the same corporate Shake Shack I had heard about.  I figured it would not be a very good value for the money, and I was right. I really liked the menu, and the prices seemed reasonable, so I went ahead and ordered a regular burger and a hot dog.  Then I added a shake.  It cost me about 15 bucks, so I figured I would be full, but after eating, I was still hungry. I must admit the quality of the food was fantastic, but the burger was way too small for the price. Although I liked the hamburger better than an In and Out Burger, it seemed to be gone in just a couple of bites.  Shake Shack burgers seem even smaller than The Habit burgers.  The value for the food just isn't there.  At any other quasi-fast food place I could spend 15 dollars and be stuffed out of my mind, but at Shake Shack I was not even full. The Shake I ordered wasn't even filled to the top of the small cup, and for over 5 dollars I really feel like I got ripped off. This is the reason I don't really like corporate places like Shake Shack or Five Guys.  They have to kick up too much money to the corporation so the wall street types can become multi-millionaires while dumb people buy small-portioned food. Shake Shack is certainly an excellent place for quality food, but I would say it is about 40 to 50 percent overpriced for the amount of food you get. I just don't feel like I should spend that much for a place that really has a fast food feel to it.  Wait in line, sit in hard chairs.  Typical fast food feel. Another thing I hate about corporate places is that the owners of the brand are usually people who think they are smarter than their customers, so they try to trick you into not noticing little things like charging for whipped cream, not allowing refills, making every item a la carte so prices build up fast, etc.  They also think customers are so stupid that they can be fooled by the hype and that people will almost always follow the crowd and waste money just to be cool. I'm convinced the upper management of Shake Shack is doomed to fail, and they must be replaced by more wise, realistic management who understand human nature with a little less arrogance and respect for their customers. I also noticed managers at Shake Shack responding to some of these Yelp posts.  Although I understand why they respond, individual store managers cannot do anything about the prices which are set by corporate accountants. I am convinced Shake Shack is going to fail unless they have major changes in upper management real soon. If you don't care about money, Shake Shack is for you.   For thriftier customers, In and Out or McDonalds is the way to go.",

    "text": "I just went here for the first time after reading the mediocre Yelp reviews, but hearing good things.  I ordered a double cheeseburger with all the veggies.  It was surprisingly delicious.  The meat and cheese was very flavorful and oozed with tasty grease.  I would have to say it's better than 5 Guys, the most obvious direct competitor.  (In N Out is half the price for a similarly tasty burger, so that probably gets the nod.)  I didn't order any fries or shake so I can't speak to those, but the burger was excellent.",

    "text": "First time I've been to Shake Shack. It had a lot of hype.   I got a shack burger with onions. The meat tasted good. It was cooked medium to medium-well. The bun was like a potato bun. The condiments were unremarkable.  The fries tasted like your standard frozen Ore-Ida crinkle cut fries.  I got a coffee shake. Excellent coffee flavor. The shakes only come in one size. It was a little small considering the price. But the flavor was premium. So the burger was expensive but tasted pretty good. The meat they used was clearly real hamburger with a good beef flavor. The fries were just average and not worth $3. The shake was delicious but small.  Overall, it tasted good but was nothing special for the price. ~$14 for a single patty cheeseburger, fries, and modest size shake. I guess it tasted a little better than In-N-Out. But a double double, fries, and shake from In-N-Out costs about half the price of my meal at Shake Shack.",

For my slider, fries and a shake, the receipt was around $18.00. That's ridiculous for a burger joint and not even to be full after. Luckily, I had a $10 gift card, or I would have been furious. I won't be back, since the portions don't match the price tag. When places charge this much for so little, I find it insulting. It's like they're trying to a Jedi Mind Trick on me so that I feel like their meal sample is actually a meal.",

I had heard a lot about it on the radio because I listen to talk radio that's based in New York City and they rave about Shake shack all the time. So when when we were driving up Central to go to get some tacos and we saw that Shake shack was now open we were pretty excited.  We got lucky because when we got there there was no line but it filled up quickly. We ordered on the staff was friendly and the food came out fairly quickly. The burgers were hot, cheese was melty, and the fries were perfect crinkle cut fries.  It lived up to all the hype plus one of the girls working there (Emma) was so nice and telling us all about the shakes and even brought us a sample of their new pretzel flavor.  She was so nice and another reason we can't wait to go back",

    "text": "Like many others, I've heard rave reviews about Shake Shack and was excited to find out they opened a location in Scottsdale...I was even more excited to find out another location had opened in Uptown Phoenix-a much more convenient drive from North Phoenix. My son and I stopped in for lunch yesterday before hitting up the Art Detour in the Roosevelt District around 1pm and there was a line out the door. I figured at that time of the day there would be a wait so we didn't mind. They had an employee outside handing out menus and also had umbrellas set up so we didn't cook in the unseasonably warm March weather. We waited in line maybe a total of 10 minutes, but again, going during normal lunchtime hours, I expected to wait a little.  I ordered the single shake burger, a hot dog for him, fries, a camelshack concrete, and a drink to share which altogether came out to be about $21. I can't say I was blown away by anything. The burger was a pretty decent burger. Whatever the shake sauce is great, and the burger itself tasted really fresh. I loved the crinkle fries, as did my son. And the camelshack was good as well; vanilla custard with pieces of banana cream pie and a caramel sauce. I think next time I'd order it sans caramel sauce because it's was almost overwhelmingly sweet, but live and learn, right?   Overall, I was impressed. We had a nice lunch at a decent price but I don't see myself going out of my way anytime soon to be back- now, if a location were to pop up on my side of town, I may reconsider.",

No special condiments, just ketchup and mustard and a Louisiana hot sauce on the condiment bar.  When our buzzer buzzed and we got our tray, I didn't see anything special. The shakes were small and 5.29 for one? My hubby's double double was almost 10$.  I pay for good food but I really didn't get anything good here. Just a scrawny hamburger  (I'm sure the meat is better than other places) and the fries tasted like ore Ida fries you made as a kid at home. Peanut Butter shake was good as the girl told me it has custard in it. They do sell alcohol here and have sports playing on the tvs. Nice atmosphere and concept but not worth the 30$ we paid for 2 hamburgers, fries and small shakes. Disappointed.",

A touch too much mayo.  I got a concrete. This is custard in a bowl mixed with various goodies. I built my own and got vanilla with cookie dough and fudge, they may as well add it to the menu because it's bomb.  Bryce got a vanilla shake. Good enough, I guess. They charge .50 for whipped cream.

Once I saw it, I was thinking, this size - for $9.59? I could of eaten this whole burger all by myself. It was a little overpriced. I agree with other reviewers - It should be more like a $6.50 or $7 burger.  Crinkle cut fries: nothing special for $2.99. If you look at my picture I posted, I had more fries than I did a burger.   The Mallow Monsoon was delightful!! It was perfect and worth the $4.59.   Service was quick and we were out of there in 30 or so minutes so.",

I have had the regular shake shack burger the first time I went but this time I had the Smokeshack and it is my new favorite. It came with bacon, cherry peppers, and the infamous shack sauce.   The crinkle cut fries and really well done and I would also recommend the peanut butter shake.  As an added bonus, they have gluten free buns for those with an allergy.",

We said since we were out here we can try it and cross it off of list. This place wasn't busy which was perfect because the one back home would have us in like for like an hour. This place is very expensive and you have to order everything separately which makes ur bill high. We spent damn near $30 for 2 sandwiches, fries and drinks  We ordered our food took a seat and waited for some bs food. We got the chick shack with regular fries and cheese fries with drinks. The chicken sandwiches were salty. The fries tasted like the were old and the cheese fries had some funny flavored cheese sauce on them.   I seriously doubt that I would go back to a shake shack. I know different locations taste different but we were disappointed and over the whole place.",

We were looking for a place to eat after, started driving and my husband saw the restaurant and it was just starting to fill up for the lunch crowd based on the parking lot. We got in and the line was barely a line, but I did notice all the tables were almost full. I sent my son to find a table and he did.  We ordered 1 ShackBurger Double (Cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce), 1 Hamburger Double with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, 1 ShackBurger Double (Cheeseburger topped with lettuce, ShackSauce and bacon), 2 Fries, 1 Chocolate Milkshake, and 1 Beer all for $40  After our pick up order buzzer went off, we picked up our meal, one of the burgers were missing so we had to wait, the beer was missing and so was an order of fries, plus the burger that was missing came with 1 patty after we paid for 2, by then we were so frustrated... not happy. Finally we got everything we ordered. We took a vote, Burgers were OK maybe they forgot the ShackSauce or something but I had to go get ketchup to add some flavor. Fries were good. Milkshake was good.  I'm finally glad I was able to try a Shake Shack to find out what all the HYPE is about which I still don't know why... and the icing on the cake is since this was the only meal I ate that day I had food poisoning from my burger all night.",

This time I ate it in the store and it didn't seem as good. Maybe it was the anticipation? It was still a good burger though! The sauce is a little subtle and the flavors get a little lost but the meat quality is good and the bun is perfect. I love that they have crinkle cut fries! They are perfectly cooked and nice and crispy on the outside. I also tried some of my boyfriends chicken sandwich. It's a pretty thick piece of chicken that was fried to perfection. The herb mayo really complimented it as well- this was probably my favorite between the 2 entrees. Their lemonade was a big highlight as well! The original is nice and tart but still refreshing and the watermelon basil is sweet with a almost spiciness from the basil. We also tried the Pie, Oh My concrete. We were both expecting more of a banana taste but, since the pie is mixed in with a heavy dose of salted caramel sauce, it was overpowered and mostly lost. If salted caramel is not your thing, then dont order this as it is pretty salty.  Overall, I'd still come back here if I'm in the area and will probably try more of the menu.",

Very nice location at Central and Camelback, the work they did to change this retail space is quite impressive. It's beautiful in fact. More importantly lots of seating inside and some outside.   Okay, let's get to the real reason I was there. The burgers!  At first I was discouraged by the prices.  I had the Shack burger with cheese $5.29 and cheese fries $3.99. I had heard great things about the shakes, so I just had to splurge and order one, peanut butter, $5.29. So as you can see, with tax I was over $15.00. A lot for a fast food joint!  I took a seat and my number was called shortly. Presentation was great. Though the burger looked  small, it was well put together. The shake too was in a small cup.   Ready? It is probably one of the best fast food burgers I have ever had. Flavor was amazing! Their special sauce is quite good. Best of all, they use a potato bun which makes a huge different.  The crinkle cut fries were also great especially covered in hot cheese sauce.   My peanut butter shake was soooo good. It turned out to be just the right size as it was very rich.   In the end Shake Shack is worth it. My only complaint would be the burger size, I could have eaten two, but it's hard to justify getting another at $5.29.   Enjoy!",

    "text": "Alright let me say this: it's really hard to beat Shake Shack. It's been my go-to choice of burger since it opened up in the Buckhead Shops when I lived in Georgia. The reason I love Shake Shack so much is because it sticks to the original burger recipe: cheese, patty, lettuce and tomato. Sometimes when you visit restaurants that want to jazz up your everyday burger, you forget what a burger is truly supposed to taste like and this is definitely it. My go-to order would be a single patty burger with extra cheese and no tomato- can't go wrong!   Last year in Atlanta, I tried the seasonal Peppermint Milkshake and haven't been able to forget about the melt in your mouth flavor! A good everyday shake from this location would definitely be the Cookies & Cream (or maybe it's called Oreo). Last week was my first time ever trying their hot dogs. Not even going to lie, I initially had trust issues about whether or not I was going to like it as much as their burger... So, like a psychopath I ordered both the burger and the dog. Long story short, TRY THE DOG. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT AT ALL.   A make or break about any hot dog situation for me is also if the restaurant has quality relish: and they absolutely do. I was taking this order home, so the guy behind the counter carefully lidded two containers full of relish for me to also take along. Oh, and the double order situation? Didn't regret that either. Haters gonna hate but let's face it: double fisting two entrees at Shake Shack is an amazing experience, and you probably secretly want to try it too. Renee Out.",

The food was average at best. Burgers were OK but nothing special and not a lot of flavor. Fries were pretty good. My wife's chocolate shake tasted like powder and was really runny. My soda tasted flat.  Definitely not going back. Too many good burger joints out there with a lot better food and a lot less expensive.",

The cheese fries were good and the service was good as well. The prices...not good. $6.84 for a burger isn't a lot to ask, and while my Smoke Shack was very good, I think $4.99 is more reasonable. $24 for 2 burgers, 1 cheese fries and 2 cokes is somewhat disconcerting. I'm close enough to walk here. And I'd like to frequent often. But it's not cost prohibitive. I understand that having a spot, never mind a marquee spot, in Uptown Plaza is pricey, but I'd think the lack of REAL competition (burger wise) in the immediate area would do well to drive business. Bring the prices down and you'll see my daughter and I often. I think many would echo this sentiment. I hope people are listening. 3.5 stars",

The employees have to do it for you. Dump a ton of ice in a cup and pour 1/4 fluid in the cup and it's done.

Only down side is the hamburgers are pretty small for the price. I bought a glass of wine, fries, and a burger which all came to $23 . I'll be back for the cheese fries burger was average.",

They have really good milkshakes too! They also do hot dogs but I haven't tried those because I always have to get a burger. Came to this location with my husband because we had the pups with us and we needed somewhere with a patio. This is where we went and the staff was so incredibly awesome. I wish I caught this guy's name, but he happened to be cleaning up outside when we got there. He brought treats out for our dogs and even took our buzzer so when the food was ready he just brought it out to us! So friendly and accomodating, I was impressed. Great customer service goes a long way so I'll definitely be back at this location!",

I'm not going to get on here and bitch about the pricing, because of the \"quality\" of the meats (grass fed, veg diets, cage free etc) and because, I thought it was worth paying for. I was wrong. The burger was greasy the bun was literally drenched in it and started falling apart. Vegetables were fresh though. The fries reminded me of elementary school style free lunch and were less than desirable. Super disappointed with my meal, and to follow I had stomach cramps before I even finished half of my meal. I'm assuming again, that it's the grease. I'd report more about the atmosphere, service and furniture but really, the crappy food is enough and the reason why we review these restaurants.

All in all we paid $51 for 3 burgers, fries and drinks. Holy crap  talk about sticker shock...the burgers were standard sized, at best... to get full, you'd want to buy 2, per my husband.   As a splurge I'd consider returning because I'm a sucker for exceptionally made burgers, but the price is a deterrent from me going on a regular basis. Bonus; they sell wine and beer also.

I had it when I lived in Washington, D.C. about 4 years ago and have been craving it ever since.  Honestly, this led to unfair expectations, but the food was still really good.  The burger practically melts in your mouth because of the buttery bun and good quality cheese.  I have to say that the patty itself isn't anything special.  I like the crinkle cut fries and (can't believe I'm actually saying this) but they are a little too crispy for my taste.  This may be because it's a new location and the employees haven't nailed the art of fry-making.  Also, it's awesome that they have beer and wine, including some local selections.    My biggest gripe is that it is pricey.  People compare Shake Shack and In N Out, which is a hard comparison because they're just different.  But In N Out is clearly the better bang for your buck.  Nonetheless, I will still find myself at Shake Shack happily eating a Shack Burger and crinkle cut fries.",

    "text": "If you haven't tried Shake Shack yet, you really need to! These guys know what they're doing. And actually... if you want an idea of the type of burger to expect go search for the video the Shake Shack owner did with Tasty.   The menu is fairly small, but definitely not minimalistic like In-and-Out. There's a handful of burgers to choose from, but I really would recommend the classic Shack Burger. When you're ready though... their Shroom Burger is a cheese-stuffed portobello in place of a patty. I can't say you'll be ready to go vegetarian, but for a few brief moments you'll probably forget there's any other kind of burger. The more I think about it, go with a friend and get one Shack Burger and one Shroom Burger to split and try them both. (And yes, you CAN get a Shroom with a burger patty added, I think it's called a Shroom Stack, but I've been scared so I haven't tried it... I'm just not there yet, ok?)  Lastly, the shakes are... well in my opinion, good. I wasn't floored or anything though. I guess I don't know what I was expecting of a shake from a place called Shake Shack, but they ARE good. Maybe I'm just not a big shake guy? And the fries? Well... they're crinkle cut so there you go.  There's really nothing else to say about fries once you divulge they're crinkle cut because all crinkle cut fries are exactly the same. But the great thing about crinkle cut fries is that you know immediately (before trying them) whether you like them or not... because they all taste the same. So if you love crinkle cut fries, you'll love these! They taste like crinkle cut fries! Me... not so much.   Try this place! It's awesome.",

I was a bit disappointed that they no longer have the spicy chicken sandwich but the original is just as delicious! The crinkle fries are always hot and fresh, but I think I'll skip the cheese sauce next time. I didn't like the consistency. I also ordered a strawberry milkshake which met my expectations.",

    "text": "We went in about 30 minutes before closing, we'd been to a show downtown and hubby had heard about this place from some co-workers.    First, it's very clean and nice seating area.  Loved the tables!  The service was also decent, friendly cashier, so no qualms about that.  Second, surprised at how expensive it was for 2 burgers, fries and drinks.  I had a bottled water, and unless it cost $15, this place is way overpriced.  Especially since their burgers are incredibly thin, so you're not paying for big, thick, juicy burgers.  Third, OMG...how much salt did they use on those burgers?  I didn't even taste anything else on it.  It felt like I had a salt lick on a bun...very unappetizing.  Also, very greasy.  When the little baggy holding the burger is greasy on the outside, you know the burger will be, too.  Hubby took a bite of his, he looked at me and said, \"what am I tasting?\"  I said...\"salt!\"  He nodded and took a sip of his very small shake.    Four, the reason for the 2nd star...the fries were very crispy.  Which, is unusual for crinkle cut fries.  So, they were actually pretty good.  Although, as I got to the bottom of the fries, they were so oversalted that I had to stop eating them.  Five, we didn't really enjoy our meal.  When my hubby apologizes for bringing me someplace that was recommended to him, I know he didn't like it, either.  We will not be going back...",

I waited less than 5 mins, we ordered the Chicago style hot dog, grilled chicken club, fries and chocolate and strawberry shakes. Like another review, the bun was half cut open so it perfectly kept the chicken and toppings in place. The gal who gave me my food instantly gave me direction where to find straws and condiments.   Overall, food and staff were great. I wish I had remembered to take a pic of our meal. We will be back.",

We arrived for an early lunch around 11am and I was shocked how quickly the restaurant filled up! I got the classic for my first time around- cheeseburger w everything, small fry, and a chocolate shake (had to). The burger was good! It's a pretty flat patty, so if you like a meaty burger I'd go double. Fries were DELISH and the shake was very yummy and easy to drink, not too thick. This meal was $14, so this isn't comparable to a Wendy's meal. The service, cleanliness, and food worth the money I'd say. Would definitely come again!",

After seeing the photo's of the chicken sandwich I was able to convinced my brother to share a burger and the chicken sandwich with me. My husband got the SmokeShack Double Cheeseburger, comes topped with all-natural Applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and ShackSauce. . It was gone in less than 10 seconds. He loved it. My brother and I split the ShackBurger Double Cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato, and ShackSauce. Along with the Chick'n Shack - Crispy Chicken Breast with lettuce, pickles, and buttermilk herb mayo. As for the burger, it was so flavorful and juicy. Something about this burger patty just explodes with flavor. Top that off with that liquid gold cheese.... one of the best burgers I have ever had. My brother's eye's rolled back in to his head at his first AND second bite. He said it was the best burger he had ever tasted. And yes. The Chicken sandwich was awesome as well. Thick, juicy, crunchy, and fresh. So glad I tried it. We also got 3 French Fries, including one with cheese. I recommend you get one with out cheese. Its delicious but after having it on my burger I was happy to get a little break from it with some of the plain French Fries. My husband had one of their shakes and he said it was very rich but he liked it!   It was really good all in all. Was it a little pricey? Yes! But I knew that coming in. I would also say that you are getting what you pay for. Quality food.",

And they have a designated table for all utensils, napkins, straws, hot sauce etc. which is convenient.   The menu is decently sized. They have a few beers on tap which was nice and a few alcoholic shakes which I thought was creative. they're shake menu was fairly small for having the word \"shake\" in the name. Still great though. Just not as many as I was expecting.   The order process is very similar to Smash burger. You walk up to the register, place your order. They give you a buzzer. You sit anywhere. When you're food is ready the buzzer will go off and you approach the expo table and pick up the food yourself. One thing that bummed me out was my inability to fill my drink.  The soft drinks are behind the counter and you have to tell them what you want to drink so they can fill it. This is always a bit of an inconvenience since most of the time you go back for a refill on the way out. So if you're one of the \"can I get a water cup. And then fill it with soda\" kind of guest, you're out of luck here. Their drink sizes are only small and large and he food comes out very quick !  Overall great experience. The menu is not overwhelming. Great atmosphere and would see myself visiting again soon!",

It may have tasted better if the burgers and fries were hot. For 2 burgers, 2 drinks and an order of fries = $29 is a bit pricey for fast food burgers. Not impressed with the burgers either.  We had their organic ice tea and mango lemonade drink. Tea tasted like tea and the mango drink reminded me of the cheap Sunny D drink that I had as a child.  So many better burger places around town that once the hype gets through this place, there won't be a line out the door anymore.",

I got there right before they opened as I knew there would be a line (sure enough there was). They handed us menus while we waited and offered water while sitting, waiting for my food. Great customer service! I ordered the SmokeShack and regular fries (want to try the cheese fries and concretes next time). The burger was absolutely delicious!! The cheese was perfectly melted, the peppers were an added pop of flavor and the bacon of course was just great. I would have liked some lettuce added and the buns to be more toasted but I know to request it next time. I'm usually not a fan of crinkle cut fries (reminds me of elementary school) but these were very good. I imagine the cheese fries will be just amazing. I can't wait to return and try a concrete also! I love that they serve beer and wine as well as offering chicken. Great place, great service, great food. They have plenty of space indoors and outdoors and have long wooden tables to fit many guests. Must try! Thank you Shake Shack for coming to Phoenix!!",

Item-by-item, you can't help but feel gouged by an undersized standard-fare burger and a slighted serving of crinkle fries.   Prices aside, it's fine. The establishment is clean and the staff is friendly. But in terms of value, 2-stars feels about as inflated as their menu prices.",

    "text": "Ok.  So, I can see what all the hubbub is about as the original location in New York has such a storied history and loyal following.  Us Phoenicians are fortunate enough to be included in the Shack's aggressive expansion beyond the Big Apple.  I know our Arizona locations will never be like the New York institution, but for many, Shake Shack would only exist, in legend, if it were not for the two new locations in the Valley.  Burgers, much like Mexican food, are so subjective as a food item because of the myriad of regional variables in included ingredients, the specified styles of preparation and presentation - not to mention the bun can make, or break, a burger.  Therefore, it stands to reason that many feel that a Shake Shack Burger is a tasty interpretation of the fundamental American burger.  Although I agree that Shack burgers are tasty, they are not necessarily the guilty indulgence offered up by other establishments.   Shake Shack does make an appetizing burger, yet I do not find myself not salivating over the thought or mention of any of their burgers, nor do I see myself making a special trip just for a burger, fries and beer.  The ShackBurger, SmokeShack and 'Shroom Burger all have flavor, but not the Pavlov inducing, bacon crunching, cheese oozing, crispy, saucy, deliciousness of burgers that can be found elsewhere.  I do, however, have a more positive opinion of their custard, shakes and concretes.    Because of the evident quality of Shake Shack's dairy desserts and their creaminess, which tastes as though it is devoid of thickeners or stabilizers (I hope), has caused me to vacillate on my star rating, and thusly has increased my final rating because of my positive dairy experiences here.  Shake Shack will not necessarily disappoint any patrons with its food, but it will not Wow them either.  Outstanding customer service would elevate the entire Shack experience as well as the perceived taste of the food, resulting in overall higher ratings and return visits.  Frankly, I am surprised that there is not a more aggressive training program to foster a Shake Shack Culture with its employees.  Although nothing specific was ever amiss on each of my visits, I have not experienced an enthusiastic greeting, witnessed a gleaming smile, genuinely felt welcome or felt a passionate adoration for working at The Shack by its employees.  Whereas I have, unexpectedly, experienced these things at other establishments - and some of those have drive-thrus - chalk one up to insightful HR departments for creating a dining culture that shows in the customer experience; the Shack and Arizona could certainly use more of it.  Shake Shack has created a niche without filling an existing need, and in doing so, it is trying to fill that need through its own proclamation of hospitality and community.  So long as their expansion is not too aggressive, I know Shake Shack will be successful; it is already regarded as an institution in New York, which the founders have set out to create, and have been seemingly successful.  Given the initial Valley locations and the Shack's trendy, socially/environmentally charged atmosphere which melds well with both the Uptown Phoenix corridor and the trendy Scottsdale shopping neighborhoods, Shake Shack will appeal to these specific and socially astute socioeconomic populations, while still attracting first-timers, thus ensuring the Shack's success here in Arizona.

    "text": "Don't listen to the haters, buy into the hype here because this place is real. I'm going to say this now, this place is better than any other fast food chain burger I've had.   Okay so let me delve into this. The burgers here are simple but incredibly well done. They also use a potato bun that adds more consistency and texture to the bun and gives you a feeling of eating more. Also when I judge a burger, it's my personal opinion to also judge the main accompaniment, the fries. I usually am not a fan of crinkle cut fries but my glob do they do it well here. A good portion that's salted just right with a great amount of crisp to it. I've been to shake shack five times in the last 6 weeks and I haven't seen a fry ever not fried enough or burnt, it's always perfect, I have no clue how they do it.   So what do I get? Well I do have a preference. I've tried their mushroom shack which is too overwhelmingly cheesy for me. It's a large portobello mushroom filled with several types of melted cheese. Maybe that's your thing, just know that it's a lot of cheese. My friend usually gets that with a regular patty in one bun (aka shack stack). This is my personal order: hamburger with bacon and a chicken patty as well. Oh my god is it heaven. For a burger place they know how to make an incredibly good fried chicken patty. Honestly it might be better than their actual burger. But that just might be me.  They also have pretty interesting desserts called concretes which is frozen custard. I think this part of the menu along with drinks rotates to give it some variety so be aware! Anyway Shake Shack is great and I want you all to absolutely love it as much as I do. Go and see the light!",

I loved the cheese fries since they didn't use a weird nacho cheese sauce.   The atmosphere in the restaurant was pretty laid back and the overall architecture is nice. One problem I did have was that there was so much sunlight reflecting in off of the cars outside that it came in through all the windows. I would suggest adding some sort of screen that can be pulled down during the day.   Other than that, this place was ok. It's better than Mcdonald's but I feel other burger places such as Smashburger have a little more to offer for the price.",

    "text": "I saw a video on Shake Shack vs In-N-Out, and was super stoked that Shake Shack was coming to AZ. I rarely venture to the east coast, so this was the perfect opportunity for a taste of their burgers. Being from CA, I'm a huge fan of In-N-Out, and simply can't help comparing these two places. First off, the burgers at Shake Shack are double the prices at In-N-Out. A double-double at In-N-Out is $3.50. A double hamburger at Shake Shack is $6.59.   I had the single Smoke Shack burger, which is a cheeseburger with bacon and chopped cherry peppers. Overall, this burger was overly greasy. The meat was tender and flavorful. I really enjoyed the cherry peppers which added a unique touch and complemented the burger well. However, the ShackSauce did not blow me away. The sauce ran on the ordinary side compared to In-N-Out's addicting spread. My boyfriend paid $9.64 for his Smoke Shack double, which was really worth $6-7 max. I was pumped up to try their crinkled cut fries. To my disappointment, the fries were equivalent to frozen fries anyone can purchase at the grocery store. Fries were poorly seasoned and lacked that fresh taste. I have to say that the best part of this meal was the shake. I had a delicious salted caramel shake, malted with whipped cream. The shake was creamy with a good consistency, not too sweet. The other flavors available were chocolate, black & white, strawberry, peanut butter, and coffee Fair Shake.   The location is fairly new, so there was a line that was no more than a 10 minute wait. We ordered our food, and was given a buzzer. It was awesome that they have free wifi. There are four TV's distributed around the spacious dining area. Since we went on a weekend, it was quite busy. Some customers had to find seating in the outdoor patio when the indoor tables were full. I really liked the idea of having water and cups of water conveniently situated by the ketchup and mustard dispensaries. It would be nice to have access to some ice for the water. They also serve wine and beer. This is a very family-friendly place with a lot of children around.  I conclude that this place does not live up to the hype. Personally, I would rather go to In-N-Out for their tasty burgers and fresh fries - all for an affordable price.",

    "text": "A few years back, during a 2 week trip back East, me and my buddy hit up 2 different Shake Shacks.  We hit up one in Washington DC and another one in Philadelphia, PA.  At the time, I had never been to one before.  Once I sampled it, I thought it was one of the best fast food burgers I had ever tried and couldn't wait to try another one.  Everything was pretty much perfect!  The only thing I didn't really like was the price.  They do use great, high quality ingredients, but you definitely pay for it.  Better bring a $20.00 bill and expect maybe a few bucks back.  Anyways.......on to present day.  I had heard rumors that Shake Shack was going to open 2 locations in the Phoenix area (About damn time!) in early 2016.  They opened their first restaurant a few weeks back, and were just about ready to open this one here at Uptown Plaza.  I had sent Shake Shack an email asking about when they were opening and if they had any \"sneak peek\" type days where a person could come in and try their food.  They emailed me back and told me about the \"Friends and Family Day\" and invited me down to try out some of their food a day before they opened to the public.  I drove down, checked in, was handed a menu and then placed my order for my meal.  They gave you the choice of 2 \"hot items\" and one drink/dessert.  I went with a single cheeseburger, an order of cheese fries, and a \"CamelShack\" concrete.  I gave the lady my menu, was handed my buzzer and went to grab a seat (cool building btw...open space, modern, couple of flat screens playing basketball, plus a nice outdoor patio seating area).  My food took about 10 minutes or so and here is how it was...................  Single Shack Cheeseburger-  I was a little confused when I ordered my burger.  At my previous visits, I ordered a Double Shack Cheeseburger and a Double Smoke Shack Burger and they came with everything on them (lettuce, tomato, sauce etc).  I asked her if I could get light on the shack sauce, and she replied, \"I could make my burger any way I wanted.\"  I took that to mean I could remove the ingredients that automatically came on it.  So I told her just plain, no sauce.  What I got was a plain cheeseburger.  Bun, meat and cheese.  I was not mad though...I love plain cheeseburgers and sometimes less is better.  (Shake Shack does use good produce though!).  I bit into my burger and noticed that it was just kind of warm.  Not piping hot, not cold, just warm.  It was cooked more towards well done, but it was still juicy and moist.  The cheese was melted nicely, and then bun is flat out awesome.  Shake Shack buns are the best!  Super soft, pillowy, with a great texture...I love them.  Best fast food buns out there!  The burger was ok but I would have liked it hotter, and if I was buying it myself, I would have went with a double (A double was not an option on the friends and family menu).  3 stars for the burger.  Cheese Fries- On past visits, I raved on how much I loved the cheese fries.  They use a great cheese sauce and cover a pile of crinkle cut fries with this delicious sauce.  Today, the cheese sauce was just as good as I had remembered!  The fries though...meh.  They weren't that great.  They seemed a little bit stale and weren't that crisp (even ones without cheese sauce, so I know it wasn't due to the cheese sauce).  I ate them all because of the cheese sauce.  If they were just a plain order of fries, I would have been disappointed.  3 stars for the fries.  CamelShack Concrete-  Wow!  The best!  Super impressed with this one!  I am a sucker for ice cream and sweets, so this was right up my alley.  Its vanilla custard, salted caramel sauce, and a slice of The Bakery Phx banana cream pie smashed in there.  It was awesome!  The custard was rich and creamy, the salted caramel sauce provided a nice sweetness, and the chunks of bananas and pie crust pieces really tied it together.  This particular dessert is also beneficial to others in the city of Phoenix, too.  Shake Shack donates 5% of their proceeds from this dessert to charity in the Phoenix area.  Good job, Shake Shack!  5 stars for the CamelShack!  I finished my meal and was outta there!  Overall, it was not nearly as good as my first 2 encounters at a Shake Shack.  It was their first day though, so they may need to work through some kinks.  I do appreciate the hell out of the invite down here,  and the free lunch!  Saying that, if I had to pay $15.00 for this lunch, and if this was my first time ever at a Shake Shack, I would have left a little disappointed and probably wouldn't be fixing to come back anytime soon.  Because I know how good their food can be though, I will be back in due time to see if this Shack can become as good as the others before it!  I'm sure it can get up 4 to 5 star territory!  Welcome to Phoenix, Shake Shack!",

    "text": "Such flavorful burgers..   I had the smoke shack and it was so savory and delicious! You can tell that the burger is quality from the first bite you take. It was super juicy and the thick bacon really stood out to me with its outstanding flavor. This burger is in a category of its own. I can't compare it to other places.   The cheese on the fries was so creamy and good.. I was not expecting the cheese to have such mind blowing flavors. I definitely recommend the fries with cheese.   The custards are so tasty and have so so much texture because of the tid bits of deliciousness they combine in the custard. I had some of the mallow monsoon and camel shack.. The camel shack had the banana creme pie combined with the salted caramel sauce in there giving it a unique flavor of its own, I just couldn't get enough of it. The mallow monsoon had the delicious chocolate truffle cookie dough with sugar cone cookie pieces.. Amazing... I liked both of them so much but when I go again I would get the camel shack because of its unique out of this world flavors.  Overall, there is no doubt I am making this place a regular for getting burgers.",

If you've been to any other locations, you know what to expect and it will not disappoint. If you've never been and swear by any other burger joint, please give it a try.  It's got the usual aesthetic vibe featuring those signature and well-crafted wooden tabletops & benches. There's also a fair amount of patio seating with plenty of shade that will come in handy as it starts warming up.  Went with my usual first meal of a ShackBurger and Shack-cago dog. Excellent per usual. Fresh, quality ingredients and big flavor. Mango lemonade & strawberry shake were both fantastic as well.  Definitely happy to have Shake Shack right around the corner from me (again). Now if they would just add delivery service...",

The kitchen and cashier section are more cramped than the Fashion Square location.  All unoccupied tables were clean, including the plentiful picnic tables outside.  Water from the condiment table was chilled, and there were plenty of cups.  My small single-item order was completed within a few minutes.  Single 'Mallow Monsoon: Far superior to s frosty, and also better than a Dairy Queen blizzard.  The chocolate and vanilla custard are swirled but not completely blended, but the overall flavor leans strongly chocolate.  I could not really taste the marshmallow sauce.  The chocolate truffle cookie dough were super rich and reminded me of fudge brownie pieces.  The sugar cone cookie pieces had a fantastic crush, and provided a great contrasting texture.  Shake Shack may be cost a little more than its competitors, but their quality is a step above as well.  My concrete was $4.98 after tax.",

The first time we had hot dogs, fries, shakes. The vanilla one was warm (they did replace it), the strawberry one was completely unsatisfying as a strawberry shake experience (too sweet, not strawberry enough). Hot dogs were OK, fries were OK. Prices were very high for the quantity and quality of the meal. We gave it a second try, this time burgers, fries, and NO shakes (one concrete though). When they rung us up, they were doing a charity fundraiser - donate $2 and get a free shake next time. I'm sorry, I skipped over the fundraiser, heard the word shake, and unloaded about how I couldn't order a shake because they were so bad. The manager came out to talk as we were getting our meal. She was very nice, but honestly I was a bit embarrassed as I'm sure the other guests in line overheard me. It's good to hear they want to improve their product and they appreciate feedback. However, it was even more awkward as our burgers and fries were now getting cold. As a second visit, this was make-it-or-break-it. It broke. Even with the coupons the manager gave us for next time, the food is just not great. The prices are way too high for the quantity and quality.",

There is an option to get double patties, but that begins to edge on being over-priced in my opinion. I was surprised that there was no drive through option. Perhaps this was their choice to separate themselves from the rest, but it takes a hit in my book as a con. Overall, this acts more of a treat that is small and delicious but not a place to fill up on.",

Honestly, there was nothing special about the meal, the actual burger was pretty tasteless, thankfully it had toppings. If this had cost $10 we wouldn't feel like we were robbed, but since it was $30+, we were robbed. I think those who say it's great must be drinking and not notice the lack of flavor, quality, and the high price. Wendy's does a lot better with a burger than this place.    I will say, the shakes were good, but really small for the $5.19 cost!    At least we learned one thing: were not going to get robbed by the Shake Shack again.",

The service was just OK at the counter, but then I went to fill my water cup and a kitchen employee was filling a huge water jug for their own use with the chilled water dispensers.  This wouldn't be an issue, but the jug was so big that it drained all of the chilled water so the rest of us had it at room temp.  I would never have remembered that at all if the food had been decent, but the burger was overcooked and not too flavorful overall.  aveTruthfully, I work near the Kierland location and the next time I crave a burger I will go across the street to Five Guys.

My fries were soggy and not the same deliciously-salted, perfectly-crunchy fries I'd had in New York.  The only thing I enjoyed was my milkshake. It was the saving grace.  I really wanted to love this location. It's in a really awesome spot and had so much potential. Bummer!",

It's a tad bit pricey due to having to order everything separate from each other, but it is worth every dollar! When you bit into the burger it's how every single burger should always taste! It was amazing! I ordered a double thinking the patties would be thin but it was a huge burger! Next time I will for sure order a single. We got the bacon cheese fries they were good but will probably pass on them next time. Just wanted to give em a try this time! The plan fries are pleasant. Restaurant was very clean. Worker was walking around cleaning tables and asking how everything was! Please bring one to WEST-GATE by the stadium you guys would make bank there!!! We will be back even though it's 35 minutes away!  9-22-17 2nd visit here! Called to ask to save patio tables for my husband and I's birthday. Manger was very nice and said of course they would love to have our party there! The food was AMAZING as usual! We had a party helper named Thomas and he was awesome! Very nice he got us water pitchers and cups brought us menus to look at brought us our food. He cleared our stuff when we were finished. They offered to keep our cake cool. They even offered to have our pets come along to enjoy their patio! It's people like this who care so much about their business that make it so nice for their customers. We will continue to come back for a great burger. Thank you shake shack for making our birthdays special with your great service!!!! ***** 5 stars for you guys always!",

The salted caramel milk shake sounded more exciting than it actually was.  May have just been me but it tasted more like vanilla than salted caramel. I'd try a different flavor.  Also warning that all this food WILL cause you to feel like crap and food coma. Proceed with caution haha.

    "text": "Like most people, I've been hearing about Shake Shack for years. The New York City-based chain is what East Coast \"peeps\" proudly proclaim to be \"their version\" of In-N-Out.   Unfortunately, they don't have In-N-Out in New York - so I'm not entirely sure they understand what they're comparing it against. And that's probably what has gotten Shake Shack in trouble with a lot of newcomers. Its loyal fans are grossly overselling it way, way too hard to the point where everyones' expectations have become completely unrealistic.  Despite this, I'm still quite fascinated by the fact that reviews for Shake Shack aren't quite as high as I had originally anticipated. Honestly, I think the corporate suits underestimated the intelligence of their target demographic. Sure, people today are more than willing to pay a little extra for a burger if the quality (and source) are of a high standard - but there's a fine-line between charging a premium for quality and charging a premium just to be greedy. And I'm convinced that this is one of the reasons why Shake Shack hasn't been as openly embraced by the locals like I thought they would be.  We've only visited here once, ordering a couple of single patty burgers with both cheese fries and regulars. I even threw in a \"Bag O' Bones\" for my chihuahua, which come directly from Bocce's Bakery.    Honestly, neither one of us thought the burgers were too bad. I mean, they were by no means the best thing I've ever sunk my teeth into, but they were still respectable. So, what's the problem, you ask? I think people are a little shocked about the smaller size, which doesn't really correlate to their asking prices. Who the hell knows?   At some point, we will pay a return visit, because I'm still trying to figure out just precisely why this place (at least in New York) garnered such a massive cult following. But after one meal, I still feel that In-N-Out is a far superior choice for a fast food burger. And after reading a lot of reviews, it sounds like I'm not alone in saying this.  Give them a try at least.",

We're flooded--absolutely inundated with chain burger places, so Shake Shack, brought to us from NY, has some big shoes to fill.   Here's what I like: The smokestack burger. Great, premium toppings. I enjoyed this thoroughly and it was over too soon. I also like the beverage selection. Abita root beer to wash it all down was amazing, but you can get a grown-up beer if you feel that way as well. True to its name, there are a variety of milkshakes, so there's quite a bit of options to enjoy on the side.   Here's what I don't like: They seem kinda small, and the beef itself was just good, but nothing above average for the price range. I like my buns nice and toasty, these were plain and very soft--almost as though they were steamed. A small, single burger and a fancy soda is like $11. With fries, we're getting into the price range at which I may as well just go to a ;real' restaurant.  I don't think it's the best, but it's good enough and you should try it. It looks spiffy and the people are nice. A-OK with me!",

I usually get lemonade, fries, and a plain cheeseburger (occasionally adding lettuce). The food is cooked to order and the quality of the beef is great. I consider this restaurant quality even though it's a fast casual place. I prefer this over places like zin burger even. I like the wood tables and spacious layout.",

We received a coupon from corporate to give them another try, so while driving through Phoenix we decided to stop. We wanted to see how their app ordering was compared to our Vegas experience so we did an app order and a counter order so we could use our coupon.  The app order was super easy and ready to pick up when they texted, however we asked for one burger with no shack sauce but it was put on both.  The other order we asked for one to have the sauce on the side, it clearly showed that on the receipt yet both burgers had sauce on them.  We ordered a cookies and cream shake but got the holiday cookie shake.  Out of 4 family members only one persons order was totally correct.  We had our dogs with us and were in a hurry so we just ate what we had as we didn't have time for remakes.  It was cool that when we asked for water for our dogs they brought out a nice big bowl of water for them.  Burgers are really nothing special and the shakes are average.

Once we were just about in the front door, we had to wait for her to tell us when we could proceed to the inside line. The menu is big and visible on the wall near the registers. We finally made it to the front and placed our order for the Smoke Shack single cheeseburger meal with an order of crinkle cut cheese fries, a Coke and a Root Beer Float. We were given a restaurant pager and we had a seat at a nice, big booth. It would be another 15 minutes until our order was ready. My husband went up to get it. Once he was seated, we checked out our food and dived into it. It was very good, hot, fresh, delicious. I think Shake Shack sets itself apart from other burger shops in that it's concept is on using only the freshest and highest quality meat and vegetables, and home made frozen custard.  The service was good and the people friendly despite it being newly opened. I recommend everyone give them a try.",

The first thing I noticed was the buns, they looked very fluffy and moist and had a nice sheen to them. I loved the burger, the meat was flavorful and the cherry peppers gave a nice sweet taste with a little bit of heat. I think the bun was my favorite and the bacon second.  I  had the camel shake for dessert. Think creamy custard meets banana cream pie with bits of piecrust, it was phenomenal and it had salted caramel. I'm definitely coming again.",

I don't like a lot of condiments so I never get the shack sauce so I can't comment too much on that. The fries are ok, not worth the calories so I usually skip them unless I'm having a bad day then fries it is but they are just okay. Service always good not always fast. They are usually pretty busy, probably because its new. I like that they have beer and wine so you could actually make it a date but won't be mad if you just stick with the mint lemonade because its good too. Can kinda get expensive but heck you won't be going every day. If you haven't ever been try it, but don't get carried away with the whole wait in line for it, its just not that serious.",

I am in a wheel chair due to a broke ankle and a worker offered to take our buzzard and pick up and deliver our food. She even gave us ketchup. Super nice and didn't have to do that. I definitely recommend this place and I'm happy it's close to my parents house so I can indulge when I come to Phx to visit!!!",

There was nothing about this food or the service that warranted being 14 bucks.  I was not impressed with the service and the food was not larger portions by any means.  I can get the same caliber burger or better at nearly any restaurant in Phoenix.  Think about this, you can get a steak with sides and salad for that price at Texas Road House.  Just a thought.  I probably would not go back here because their prices are those of a sit down restaurant... this is a fast food burger joint.  The prices should match.  Not worth it at all. Also, for the price they are charging they can do way better on the cleanliness of the dining area.",

If you are use to paying .99cents for burgers then you will feel the crunch at this place. This is for people who are use to quality food. We are use to paying around 8 bucks a burger at The Stand on Indian School. Glad we have a spot that uses great quality close by. 2 Burgers 2 Shakes and 1 Fry was a good 33 bucks. Will come back!",

The wait to order food was just about 5 minutes long. We found a seat to sit inside. I noticed they have disposable wipes set on the garbage can areas to wipe the table if need be. The food was not ready right away so they gave us a buzzer. It took 20 min for our buzzer to buzz from the time our order was stamped on our receipt! I was starving!!!  My chicken dog was fine, nothing added to it. I opted to add ketchup, mustard, and Louisiana hot sauce which was offered at the condiment counter. My bf had a shack burger which looked rather small and he said was fine. We both however really enjoyed the fries (regular, not cheese which IS offered btw). We shared a soda, which they make behind the counter.   Needless to say, neither of us are planning another visit, however when or if I do, I plan to try a shake and probably will order some fries to go with it! What can I say If you give a girl some fries.....she may just want a milk shake to go with it!",

The patty was thicker, and more tender than Smash.  It was a a bit more expensive at $8 than Smash.  I didn't try anything else.  I would probably go again, but it is still hard to compare to the cheap yet very good In-N-Out double cheese burger ($3.5), or the expensive ($11 lunch special) super awesome, highest quality \"Perfect\" burger at Bobby Q's.    It fits the bill somewhere in between.  I think it would be 5 star if it were priced closer to $6 mark.",

I quickly ordered and waited about 10 minutes for my food to be prepared. The fries and cheese sauce were okay but luke warm. I would prefer both to be hot, especially the cheese sauce. The 'shroom burger was a little messy but tasted good. I think it is a little on the smaller side but did find it tasty.   Ultimately, my meal cost about $14, that is a little high for fast food.

My third time visiting and I am still shocked at the price. I am all for getting what I pay for, but this is just a burger place with no fancy servers or special meat. The price you pay for counter-serves burgers is a bit too high. The value is lacking. If the $8 double burger (burger only) isn't enough.... Try $2.50 for a small soda!?! Seriously!?! For a soda?? This is one ridiculously exorbitantly priced small soda. Oh... And it's not self serve, so you need to ask for a refill. Not sure if it's free or not.  Clearly the soda machine here has the best ROI. That followed by the beer, the frys. I would pay an $8 burger all day long for one this quality.... I'll consider if I will return every time due to the drink prices.  Owner: Be reasonable with your soda/beer prices. You are a counter-serve burger joint.... Not a steak house.",

When i asked what type of drinks they had the girl helping us was like \" whats that? \" seriously? 2nd star deducted because of the prices. 31$ for 2 burgers 2 fries and 2 Small drinks. What the heck! 3rd Star deducted because the staff here preferred to be watching a game instead of helping me out when i simply needed a refill . And 4th and foremost THEY ARE WASTING CUPS!! When i asked for the refill she told me that shes going to give me another cup. I had mine right there! Thats a waste seriously. This place is just frustrating. Rather go to The Stand where the food is great and good prices and the people are awesome! Not coming back",

    "text": "First time at Shake Shack. Got the Smoke Shack and cheese fries. Prices are a little high for me but I compare all burgers to in-n-out - very rarely does a $7-10 burger beat a $3.75 Double Double IMO.  Server was not awesome. Not friendly. Bran new joint never asked if I been here or not. Nothing. Never said hi even.   So, with that said, I found it pricey. Single burger with BBQ and bacon is $7. It was alright but nothing great. Meat seemed undercooked to me. Inexcusable for a burger shack. Bun was good but chewy. Bacon very tasty.   The cheese fries are good but severely lacking in amount of cheese making them bad. I like crinkle cut fries, many don't. Like my potato to actually have potato in it so I like the fries here.   Overall - probably won't be back. One and done. Don't see the point. Should of stayed in NY where they love you evidently - guess they never had in-n-out burger.",

    "text": "So, I finally went.  They've been open long enough to have worked out any kinks.  The place is clean and nice.  It is where the Boston Market was before that whole strip was knocked down.  The tables claim to be made from \"reclaimed New York bowling alleys\".  Parking is ample.  When I went (a Wednesday evening) there were no lines to speak of.  Service was of the \"order here, pickup there\" style with pagers handed out for you to know when to pick up.  My order was placed at 6:05pm and served at 6:12.  Pretty good for that time of day.  Since it was my first visit, I didn't muck about with the order.  I ordered a double shake burger, a hot dog with onions-ketchup-mustard and a chocolate shake.  They had store-made lemonade and craft beer on the menu, but if you go to a place named \"Shake Shack\", how could you not order a shake?  The burger was great!  First rate Angus beef, properly cooked.  The veggies were fresh, and the tomatoes were ripe (as they should be this time of year).  Absolutely no complaints.  Be sure to get enough napkins.  The chocolate shake was also fine.  Very chocolaty.  I didn't try the fries.  Partially because I'm not that big a fan of fries anyway, and partially because the online reviews of the fries weren't very positive.  Pre-frozen crinkle cut fries; not fresh cut fries like at In-N-Out.  The hot dog was only so-so.  Vienna Beef dog, sliced down the middle and fried.  Nothing wrong there.  It was delivered with only onions.  I mentioned I asked for also ketchup and mustard, and was politely told those were available at the condiment bar.  Nothing bad there, but nothing special either, especially given the price.  Which brings us to why only three stars.  The price.  My double burger, hot dog and shake was over $18.  I don't argue the experience was pleasant, and the burger was terrific.  Maybe I'm old and cheap.  So, summary:  I loved the burger and nothing else there turned me off.  But given the prices, they will be a treat and not a regular visit.",

    "text": "Still 3 stars.   Came ahead of what - presumably - is going to be a Friday-night dinner-rush. No line. A few occupied tables. Many of which, it turns out, had diners waiting for their meals. 10 minute ticket time. Not bad. But, even though cooked to order, seems slower than it could be. Actually much better than my first experience. But, there was a long line that time.  The place is spotless which cannot be overstated. Too many fast food \"restaurants\" that are far from clean. Friendly staff. Time to lean? Yup. Time to clean! They were on it. Their self-serve condiment bar was fully stocked. The dining area and what I could see of the kitchen were clean, too.  I had a single ShackBurger and small fries. $9. Not cheap! But, OK. And, here's why: the burger had a nice grill flavor and was cooked medium rare. Fresh lettuce and a tasty slice of tomato. I don't like what they use for cheese - it reminds me of melted Velveta. Not usually a fan of crinkle fries for a lot of reasons. These were OK, though. Good amount of salt. Good amount of crispiness. And, the oil used was clean. But, crinkle fries fall apart easily IMO. These were no exception.  I'm not a fan of custard in any form. So I skipped the shake, the Concrete and the whatever else. It's an east coast thing. I get it. I'm Surf City, dude. Gimmee ice cream. The higher the butter fat, the happier I am. Skipping this cut my ticket cost nearly in half.  Not sure I'd come back if there was a line. I'll be back but it won't be a priority lunch stop, either. I see this more for lunch than dinner. So, for me, though I like a brew with a burger, that's not happening for lunch.  I hope they find a following of Raving Fans to support them. Uptown deserves this kind of boost. So, NYC to PHX: time to represent.",

From what I heard prior to my visit, it is a little overpriced for what you get, but has good seating. I would say that is True. I ended up getting the chicken burger. It was okay. It was crispy on the outside of the chicken patty, but the flavor was pretty bland and the bread wasn't as fluffy as I expected it would be. The crinkle fries were better than most crinkle fries I've tried. I would give this place three stars.....but one extra star added for the amazing staff that walked around and refilled drinks and made sure everything tasted good. For around 21 dollars, you can get two burgers and some fries, so again for what I consider eat-in fast food, it seems a little high.",

    "text": "Awww man it's Shake Shack!!!!! - my new answer to \"Where you wanna go to lunch?\"  I've had a lengthy relationship with burgers and shakes, as my 2XL tee size will tell you. Throughout the years, my favorites have ranged from Wendy's in grade school, to Jerry's, the local counter near my church in middle school, to In N Out for high school and college, then reluctantly to Five Guys when I moved to the East Coast. Now, even back in the West, I think Shake Shack has the crown. (No offense, In N Out - I still do the pilgrimage to the crossed palms a few times a year)  But Shake Shack's combo of stellar burgers combined with still stellar, yet delicious options beyond burgers, bring them to #1! The bacon cheese fries, the portobello mushroom patty, the peppers, the floats and shakes, the seasonal lemonade, all bring it! The burgers are the standout, as it should be, right up there with a Double Double animal style, but everything else beats In N Outs fries by a mile.   It's a Boy Dance Party - Shake Shack!",

After exploring Papago park, my friends and I headed to this Phoenix location.  I ordered the single ShackBurger, a side of bacon and cheese fries, and the ShackMeister Ale. For a standard cheeseburger, the ShackBurger was excellent. The bun was soft like a brioche, but it held together very well. I noticed that the bun wasn't sliced all the way through, so that may be part of the reason why the burger didn't slop around and fall apart. The burger wasn't messy either, so the bread didn't get soggy. I couldn't put my finger on what was in the ShackSauce, but it was good. The burger was juicy and packed on flavor. I totally enjoyed the bacon and cheese fries. I hate the kind of nacho cheese sauce that comes out of a can, but I could tell that the cheese sauce used on the fries was a mixed blend of better quality cheeses. I was a huge fan of Shake Shack's crinkle cut fries in general.   My biggest regret is not being able to have Shake Shack whenever I want. It could never replace In n Out for me, but it's certainly better than Smashburger. Why isn't there a Shake Shack in the Bay Area? Please come to San Jose.",

I wished I had more time to hang out here.   I had the cheeseburger, fries and a milkshake (coffee milkshake). It was perfect. The perfect amount of food and just the right flavor. The meat is high quality, you can tell from the taste. I ordered mine well done and it came well done. Fries were crispy and fresh. Coffee milkshake was the bomb. I wish I could eat here more often!!! Maybe they will build one in Sactown soon.  LOTS of seating. I was worried it would be small inside, but it isn't. I came at the height of lunch hour and easily found a table. The staff and the manager were super friendly and kind. Well done Shake Shack!!",

I had the Carmel Banana cream pie concrete which is what they call he custard with toppings folded into it. It was De-Lish-Ous! In fact I have been on a quest to find a local place near my home with something similar. I can't to try the burgers next time. See ya soon Shake Shack!",

The service was professional and nice   Now the cons:  I paid 27.00 for one large drink, a shack stack burger, a BBQ burger, and one cheese fries.  I did not like the shack stack burger, it had a cheeseburger as well as a deep fried portobello muchroom stuffed with 2 types of cheese. Should of known the burger was going to be cheesy. So I switched it out for the burger with red pepper and it wasn't that great either. The problem with the burgers are is that the ingredients don't have a balance. The first one was too cheesy the second one tasted too vinegary from the peppers. The size of burgers were tiny? They are too pricy for the portion. I was not impressed by the food, only the atmosphere.",

But would I go back there to get them? No.  My regular size soda looked about the size of a child's sippy cup. And no self-service refill fountain.   It's LOOOOOUD in the place. Didn't get a booth. The tables and chairs are I guess supposed to look like industrial Ikea maybe? They were uncomfortable.  There are so many far superior places for a burger in town at much lower prices.

    "text": "I have this friend from New York........ So I go to the shack, no one waiting the place is empty at 2:30 on a Friday. I'm a virgin; I let them know this. Were they anxious to give me suggestions or explain the offerings at all: NOPE! The employees couldn't be less interested in selling anything. In fact the mood was as if I was bothering them. I certainly missed out on some workweek hijinks from the very personal conversations that were taking place. Off to a shaky start, pun intended. Whenever I inquired how is this burger or how is that shake; the standard it's good was replied. I decide to be a purest and go for an original Shackburger, cooked Medium. Fries and the Salted Caramel shake.   While waiting for you food I noticed the decor which is fun and trendy. There is a fixin's bar with ketchup, mustard, hot sauce, salt and pepper you get the idea. I grab the things I want and have a seat.   $5.29 The burger a single patty seemed about 3 to 4 ounces, prepared correctly but NO flavor. I added salt and pepper it was less bland. It is very small for the price. The bun was nice and soft it actually had more flavor than the beef.   $2.99 The fries, let my preface this with I love crinkle cut fries, these were not my fav. In my opinion they weren't even as good as Del Taco's. I don't use much salt but these were in dire need of salting! They were on the hard side as well perhaps over cooked a bit. Which again I normally like but these fell flat. Nothing exciting, small portion and over priced.   $5.29 The shake was the worst part of my meal, it was so sweet I could not drink it! It tasted like a third of this very small cup was pure caramel. I thought if I mix it up more it will get better and that didn't help, it was unbearable I had to throw it out. The price on this very small shake about 12 to 16 ounces maybe? Um no thank you! I'll go across the street to Dairy Queen and get a better shake.   So in closing for almost $15.00, I had a kids meal in a fancy space. Sorry Shake Shack I wont be back.   For a sit down burger joint I will continue with my fav Steak N Shake, Twice the food for 2 3rds the price! Flavorful Original Double Steakburger, Large fry, Large Hand dipped shake under $10.00 Delish!",

The ordering process was a bit slow as it was lunch time and busy but they only had one person taking orders. The menu is pretty straightforward...burgers, fries, shakes. I always order chicken instead of hamburgers and they only had one chicken sandwich option but they also have hot dogs so maybe I will try that next time. I had the chicken sandwich fries and a soda which ran about $12.00. For what is essentially fast food that's a bit much. My sandwich was good although a bit messy as it was loaded with shredded lettuce, pickles, and mayo. They served crinkle cut fries which I happen to be a big fan of and they have a good assortment of fountain drinks. I never see Fanta grape soda as an option so that was a fun surprise. They also have items on the menu for your dog if you are bringing your four-legged friend along.  It's definitely worth checking out of you are looking for something quick and a step above McDonalds.",

My wife and I went on Sunday afternoon. We got a cheeseburger, chicken sandwich, and shared a cheese fries. The total bill was $16 bucks. Seems like a value to me.  Both the burger and chicken sandwich were awesome and a good size. This is not like what you would get at In-n-Out where I can power down two double doubles without batting an eyelash. One double here would more than satisfy me here.  The beef was delicious and props to the girl at the counter who asked if we wanted pickle and onion on it... YES. The pickles are bomb and whoever does the buns should get a nice pat on the back. Perfect size and tooth to not fall apart with the juicy as hell burger and nice gooey cheese.  Chicken sandwich was spot on. I think Chick Filet has a great, simple chicken Sammy. This was just like that, but with a better, lighter, batter to it. Yum.  Last is the cheese fries. Hate to admit it, but I love some cheese fries with the standard runny \"nacho\" cheese. Prefer them that way. The cheese on these babies knocked my socks off. It had that gooeyness that I covet but the flavor far surpasses my wildest cheesy dreams. Such a nice refined chedar/irish cheddar flavor... I need this recipe because it would also make the perfect mac and cheese.  FIVE BIG STARS all the way for Shake Shack.",

The girl that was helping us could care less about any questions we were asking, she was really unfriendly and just wanted to take our order and get to the next person.

    "text": "Like most people; I had to try the legendary Shake Shack. Like most people; I had to see what the fuss was all about. Like most people; I loved the food that I consumed. Like most people; I just can't justify how much money I spent on what's essentially fast-food.  The burger is delicious. the quality of the beef and whatever other ingredients that are used to make the patty may be of a higher quality and freshness than you find at most upscale burger restaurants. It's also presented beautifully even if it is just wrapped in paper. The bun, lettuce and tomato are all the perfect size and taste to compliment the beef. The sauce is just alright. I'm not too sure what's in it, but it's heavily mayo-based, which remains the predominate flavor.  The shake is also incredible. Shake Shack doesn't just stick with the standard vanilla, chocolate and strawberry options. There is a pretty solid variety of unique flavors. Once I saw salted caramel on the menu, I had to try it. I was not disappointed. Not into shakes? There's beer, wine, and plenty of unique soft drinks to choose from.  The ultra modern ambiance makes for a nice dining experience. The wood tables made form refurbished bowling alley floors are a nice touch. The three flat screens playing sports and news make for a nice distraction if you need something to look at. And the patio looked like a nice spot to dine as well. The restaurant was also spotless despite a pretty sizable crowd at 9:30 on a Sunday night. And if you're wondering, it took about 10 minutes from when I ordered, to when the buzzer went off to get my food at the counter.  So, why just three stars? The price. I don't mind paying good money for good food, but I paid nearly $12.00 for the single patty burger and a shake. No fries or other sides. While not overly expensive, and certainly a filling meal, I could have had more food at a lower price at other quick-service restaurants. I also could pay just a few bucks more and get full-service at many other places. If there was a location closer to my home, I would happily treat myself to a meal there every few months. But since there is only this spot, and the one in Scottsdale, I can't justify going out of the way to grab a burger here. Shake Shack is good. Just not that good.",

I saw the lines for the past few months at both locations and I waited to strike when the line was gone. So I hit it up.  Bacon burger was good. The bun was one of the best in the biz. The meat fresh. The bacon- meh.  The fries are good and crispy. They zig zaggers which some either love or hate. Personally not a favorite but people are so picky so whatever.  The hot dog loses.  A competitor has a similar hot dog and the quality of the dog is better and the char on the bun is better. Pass on the dog here. Tastes boiled. Not sure.  The shake/ice cream though. Legit. Went with a marshmallowy, chocolatey, waffle coney cup of wonder. I'll be back just for that after a burger.  Seating was amble and staff friendly so all in all a great little burger shack. Not a place I'd go out of your way to have but maybe cravings will start.",

I had the Shack Stack burger which was a good way of trying two of the more popular items on the menu -- the Shack burger and the 'Shroom burger. The partner-in-dine was ravenous and so he went with the double Shack burger. We also shared an order of Cheese Fries. I also threw caution (for calories) out of the window and went for the Cookie Butter concrete. The burgers were fantabulous! They were juicy and savory. I suspect the Shack sauce to have been concocted by the angels themselves. The crinkle-cut fries were top-notch too. I liked how the concrete had sizable toffee bits. Devilish-ious!   Overall, the Shack wasn't too shabby at all. We would definitely be back and back and back.",

    "text": "As a midwesterner, transplanted to the desert, I never seemed to understand the fuss of Shake Shack before it came to my area. I liked other rival burger places enough, but figured it would measure up about the same... boy, was I wrong!  Since Shack Shack came to Phoenix, I cannot stop craving it. I even left Phoenix, but every time I am in town I stop here. The burgers are always SO juicy, just dripping with flavor and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend the Smoke Shack (Single or Double Cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, ShackSauceTM). The combo of their bacon and cherry pepper is PHENOMINAL. I can order it again, and again, and again.  To pair with your tasty burger: I recommend the cheese fries. They occasionally have special extra toppings or specialty fries, or even a white cheese (opposed to the classic cheddar) if you ask, but I prefer the classic cheese fry at the end of the day. I love a thick potato crinkle fry, and if you do too, you've came to the right place. If you are a root beer lover, they have their own in-house draft root beer that's a True crowd pleaser, but it's a bit to over carbonated for my liking. I opt in for water, or the house red wine, if I am feeling fun.  If you've got a sweet tooth, I suggest ordering their flavor of the month shake to share! They're always delicious, and fun, but so filling after such a greasy meal (no shame, in our burger game).",

Of course this is a chain restaurant but really they do a great job of bringing a fresh tasting burger and delicious tasting custard.    This trip my wife really wanted some cheese fries and I wanted a cheeseburger and custard. They also had chicken nuggets and gave them a shot. It would be very tough to beat chic fil a but let's give em a shot!   The cheese fries were hot and fresh with a good amount of cheese all over. The cheese tastes like the same cheese they put on the cheeseburgers. Yummy fries! Now the cheeseburger is perfectly seasoned and has all the delicious elements to a good burger. I really feel the meat is fresh and the toppings are fresh. So good!! The chicken nuggets came out super hot and are pretty good. I did notice the nuggets breading tends to crumble off which didn't give me that crunchy nugget texture I was hoping for. Now the custard is the best! It's a nice thick smootj texture that I love. I just got a scoop of the custard but you can get it in a concrete to add delicious toppings to the yummy custard  All around I love shake shack! I think they do a great job with the food for a chain restaurant. Give them a shot if you're in the area!",

Hot, crispy, perfectly bite sized and tasty as hell that you don't need any dipping sauce.

    "text": "What to say? HMMMMMM. Remember when your dear sainted mother taught you if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all? Well your mamma didn't have a YELP review that needed to get done.  Burger good, crispy chicken sandwich good, Spicy Chicken sandwich very good, hot dog blah fries blah blah   Bill$$$ HOLY FREAKING COW!  Went with the wife on a staycation instead of a real restaurant, because a friend of ours (who we no longer trust when it comes to food sadly), insisted it was really really good.  Stood in line, ordered, winced at the bill, and went and sat and waited for our order on furniture designed by the Marquis de Sade.  After massaging the grill marks out of my butt, I went and picked up order from counter, grabbed ketchup, shuddered and avoiding making eye contact with the packets of mayonnaise, and looked in vain for any real condiments.   As I sat eating my humble meal, I marveled at the ingenuity of the founders of the chain at convincing you that you are just at a burger joint and therefore counter service it ok, when they charge you enough for you to go to a sit down restaurant and eat.  Ok, OK the food was decent. Not enough to convince me of the validity of the fanboy frothing, but pretty ok. The burger was nice, although small for $11 bucks and i suppose the Hot pickled cherry peppers do something for the back east crowd. My palette said, \" I remember eating a whole jar of those as a wee child!\". How cute!  Wife's chicken sandwich was pretty good if small also. Spicy chicken that I had a bite of, was pretty tasty, and I regret not listening to inner Chris tell me it was the better bet. Inner Chris is usually right, but don't tell him that, he is a snob already.  The chicago style dog was a joke with a hot dog the size of 3 vienna sausages welded together and about as tasty. They were kind enough to drown it in non-standard relish (not bright green! HERESY!). I suppose as the only menu item under $10 other than the fries, i should have expected it.  Save yourself the trouble, Go get TWO animal style double doubles for less than the price of one of these absurdities, and then tell amusing anecdotes to your children about how you almost spent their college money on a burger and fries.",

    "text": "Pricey for what you get  If I am looking for a fast food burger I usually visit In-N-Out Burger. However, today we were loking for something different and thought we would try the Shake Shack.   The restaurant is well kept and clean and the staff was friendly and accomdating. The restraunt wasn't busy and we were able to place our orders right away. The food we got was good, but other than some variations on the kinds of hamburgers they have, nothing was overly impressive for the extra price. Two single cheeseburgers, an order of french fries, and shake at Shake Shake comes to $23  This is a place to go to if you want alcohol with your burger.  Shake Shack offers a large collection of beers, wines and mixed drinks.  However, If you want a burger and fries and a soda, I would head to Zinburger or In and Out for much less.  .",

I usually end up just eating fries. I was surprised to see the portabella mushroom sandwich option. Low calorie and healthy this is definitely not, but delicious it is!  My son enjoyed his burger although they did seem to go over the top with the peppers.  The fries are crispy and good but you have to order separately. We didn't indulge in a shake because the food isn't cheap to begin with and adding a $5 shake on top of it was over the birthday budget. Plus there's a Dairy Queen across the street.",

Place is pretty empty right now (8:40pm on a Friday), but I could see it getting more packed as more people discover it.   ****Be advised any who think this a \"fast food\" place. Food comes out quick, but not that fast. There's a reason why there isn't a drive through window and they have a stack of 50+ pagers.****  That being said, the food came out hot, delicious, not very greasy, and traveled well. Is this my new staple burger joint? Probably not, but I'll be back again.   All things considered I'd say Shake Shack is somewhere between In N Out and Zinburger. Both in price, quality, environment, and overall dining experience.  *pro tip* get fry well! Super crispy and extra delicious!",

We both ordered cheese fries and a large soda. The price tag came out to $36.45. This is a bit pricey for Burger and Fries so our expectations were real high.  The place was pretty busy with a mixed crowd of families and couples/single diners. The staff was cheerful as well as helpful right when we waked in.  The food arrived relatively quickly, although if you asked Tim it took forever.  The food quantity was a bit small for what they charge (look at the image of my food). The fries were just crinkle cut fries with a cheese sauce on them. I wouldn't say it is worth the $3.o9 they charge  The redeeming factor is the flavor. The burgers were delicious and moist..not dried out. The fries were kind of boring.",

Juicy, cheesy, flavorful, with the crunch from lettuce and sweetness from tomatoes. Nir-van-a!   I'm from Seattle, I know Nir-van-a.

So, I wasn't that surprised when I realized that Shake Shack has small hamburger patties as well. I do like the very soft buttery hamburger buns. And I appreciate the self-serve water spout they offer because we do need water in this hot AZ weather and I appreciate being able to serve myself rather than ask for a cup of water. Just sayin' In closing, I do like the shake shack and will be back but the pricing is a little much considering I could go to jack in the box and basically get the same thing probably for less money.",

    "text": "In short: Individuals with disabilities are not only an inconvenience but worse yet a laughing stock to the staff and the manager at Shake Shack.  Went here tonight (Sunday 8-13) for a late night burger after a movie. In the past, on our visits to Shake Shack we've enjoyed good food and at least mediocre customer service. Tonight as we left the restaurant just after 10 pm, we found the front door locked. One of the female staff members behind the counter informed us that we would have to go to the door on the far side of the restaurant. We told her that it would be easier for us if we could just unlock it. She said no, but seeing the twist lock we unlocked the door. I held up my cane and informed her that it was difficult for me to walk far. She glared, shook her head, rolled her eyes and walked away. I walked out the door, rethought it, and decided it would be good to get her name to complain formally to management the next day. Upon re-entering the restaurant, another female worker informed me that the other female worker who rolled her eyes \"didn't hear.\" Shocked, I informed her that I held up my cane, and I know she saw it as she was staring straight at me. The female worker who rolled her eyes and glared came out, telling me that she couldn't hear. I told her I knew she saw my cane. She quickly informed me that she had epilepsy, a matter entirely beyond the point, and would never discriminate. I asked for her name, and she went for the manager not telling me. The manager finally came out and apologized for the discriminatory and out rightly rude behavior. He informed me he would speak with her, yet  he also was not wearing a name tag and did not give her name or his own. Names are apparently top secret as it allows them to continue a history mocking customers - something that became very visible after scrolling through only two pages of reviews on this location. As we drove off, she had her arm slung on his shoulder and the two were laughing their heads off. One day they will know what it feels like to walk in my shoes. Everyone, as Joe Kennedy stated, will be brought to their knees one day by a diagnosis or accident; it's sad that these two are so incredibly callous individuals that even that may not help them to feel empathy towards others.",

    "text": "I was disappointed in the quality of the food here. The restaurant itself looks very modern, clean, and has trendy decor for a fast-food joint. I was hoping for a more upscale fast-food burger place. Chicken sandwich was over-fried (breading was dark brown) and soaked in grease. Chicken dog was blah, just a plain-looking dog on a bun, no frills, also no flavor. The hamburger was the best looking one of the three items we got, but was small and somewhat greasy. No special flavoring or pizzazz on the burger. It was ok. The only side available were fries, with or without cheese. They were the crinkle-cut ones you get frozen at the grocery store. I wish there was as much quality and variety in the food as there is in the custard, shakes, and drinks. I'd come back for frozen treats, not food.  4 stars for desserts 2 stars for burgers 1/2 star for chicken sandwich and the fries",

We ordered a double burger and chicken sandwich and shared an order of fries.  Everything tasted great and we left very satisfied.  We were going to get a shake on our way out the door but the line was too long so we have to return!  Better quality burger than five guys, smashburger or the habit... Not as good as switch or fez (but about the same price).",

First the price.. single shake cheeseburger, chicken shake sandwich an order of cheese fries, and 2 shakes strawberry and salted caramel. total = $28.00.  Next.. taste..ordinary at best. The chicken sandwich which is deep fried had a slight \" the oil needs to be changed taste\" and was not golden brown..very dark brown (old oil) and the herb mayo that is supposed to be on the sandwich.. well if it was there was  a tiny dot of it. cheeseburger was nothing special again where's the shake sauce (still in the bottle I guess). cheese fries were a tiny portion with an even tinier cup of cheese that was almost to thick to pour over fries, it came out in clumps. the shakes were excellent, however a bit pricey. all in all I think I will stick with Lenny's on central ave. or Habit Burger.",

The only reason we tried it was because we were picking up Lou Malnatti's pizza as a take out a few doors down and we had a long ride home. Thought it would be a 'tide me over' until we had pizza for supper. So overrated. Too expensive for such a small burger like the size of a White Castle slider. Ridiculous. Cashier was somewhat nice/rude. We had taken some change out of the car to use that was hanging around. Had told her exactly the correct amount of change. Bill was 12 something. Had three in coins, mostly quarters. She gave a rude look at the change, like, seriously? She then proceeded to tell a co-worker to put the change into her drawer. Why couldn't she do it???? Asked for fries well done, crispy, and hot. Brought food to table. Fries were cold and not crispy. ewwweeeee. While I had them re-make the fries, the burger got cold. Will never go back. Just don't understand the hype and excitement of this burger chain. If I am going to go out for a burger and to a chain, it's Five Guys all the way!",

    "text": "The food is OK, but this company is completely unethical. [Nothing specific against this particular location; this seems to be a company-wide problem.]  So I went in last December (to the Scottsdale location) to buy my trainer a $50 gift card (he loves Shake Shack).  The sign says free $5 gift card with the purchase of each $25 gift card.  So I walk up to the counter and ask for a $50 gift card and a free $10 gift card.  Um, sorry, we can't do that. You only get the free card when you buy a $25 gift card. So I say, fine, give me two $25 gift cards and two free $5 gift cards. Uh, I don't know if we can do that.  I'll have to ask my manager.  I point to the sign - how do you not give me two free $5 gift cards, I just bought two $25 gift cards?  Um, I'll have to check with the manager. The guy waiting in line behind me who has listened to the entire exchange has this \"seriously - you've got to be kidding me\" look on his face. Finally, after about five minutes the manager comes out and approves the transaction. They charge me $50 and give me two $25 gift cards and two $5 gift cards.  That's Strike One.  Two weeks later I go in (to the Phoenix location) to use my two $5 gift cards.  I order a burger and a concrete.  What size concrete do you want?  I say, can you show me the sizes?  Great, thanks, I'll take the small one. Then they tell me, oh yeah, we can't take these gift cards - they're only good during certain dates - check the fine print.  Wow, OK, bad on me, I guess, for not reading the fine print. I pay for my meal and decide that I'll use my gift cards on my birthday in January.  They call my number, I get the meal and the concrete is half the size they told me it would be.  The cup is the size they showed me, but there's literally a giant hole in the middle of it - everything is stuck to the inside of the cup. I ask about it.  Oh yeah, that's just the way those come.  Yeah, like that's not completely misleading.  It's like those ice cream containers that have a big, hollowed-out space at the bottom.  OK, that's Strike Two.  Strike Three came today.  It's my birthday, and I'm looking forward to a nice lunch.  I walk in to the Phoenix location and order a burger and a hot dog (I'm certainly not falling for that concrete scam again). Comes out to $10.40.  I give them my two \"free\" $5 gift cards.  Oh no, you can't apply more than one gift card to the same transaction.  What, are you f-ing serious???  I check the gift card again and there's no restriction like that on there.  Sorry, that's just our policy.  Well, guess what, Sh-t Shack?  I have a policy, too.  I don't do business with unethical companies like you that are just out to screw over their customers.  As far as I'm concerned, you're Panera to me.",

The shakes are really good tho. No free refills on soda products which sucks. It's also really expensive. Lunch for 3 ran me 45$. I'll  stick with culvers if I want something similar. *note not a culvers fan just found it rereally similar.",

The chicken sandwich was also dry and too crispy on a boring (also dry) white bun. The burger patty was too thin to be cooked anything but well done. Shack-nado hotdog was also gross. Everything was small for the price. Save your money and go to Five Guys, In n Out, or Chic Fila. Really, go anywhere but here. I was looking forward to this place but will now be marking it off my list - forever!",

    "text": "After enjoying a strawberry shake from the Shake Shack in New York last year, I was excited to hear that one was opening in Phoenix.. I had not previously tried the burgers so I was looking forward to try one.. We ordered 2 cheeseburgers,2 crinkle fries and 2 milkshakes .. The price was $32 which I thought was a little high.. The burgers were were small and just ok.. little on the greasy side as well.. The fries were served warm, they keep them under a heat lamp which is odd since they cook your burger fresh,  the fries should be also.. The strawberry milk shake was good but we asked for no whip cream but they served it with the whip cream... The restaurant is clean with very nice friendly employees .. Overall would not come here again.. Would be better off going to Five Guys if you are in the mood for great burgers!!",

The burgers were also tasty and not dripping in grease. If you're at a shake shack you HAVE to get a shake. The shakes were delicious and blended to perfect consistency. Not too thick or runny. My friend got vanilla and I got the salted caramel shake and it tasted like salted caramel. As for burgers my friend got the double Shackburger and I got the Shack Stack which was a 'shroom burger and cheeseburger in one. Both were delicious! It's all a la carte so it can cost quite a bit. They can use some combo meals. Satisfying meal but it is quite pricey.",

Additionally, all of the staff is super friendly! They always bring out a bowl of water for our boys. One time, one of the girls working even brought out my order to me when I was there alone with my dogs. It's hard to find a place we can bring our dogs to, and even harder to find one that's good and we can take the boys to. We love this place!",

Lol their meat here is organic grass fed, and cage free. So you pay for what you get.   Ok so I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and it was delicious! The chicken was fried to perfection! And if you complain about a crispy chicken sandwich being too greasy why are you ordering it?! They serve it with pickles and a herb mayo everything about that sandwich was amazing.   I also got cheese fries, because why not. And they were ok I am not a huge fan of cheese fries in general, but the person I was with insisted. For dessert we got a strawberry milkshake it was yummy as well.  Customer service is great. Very friendly and helpful staff. The menu gets to the point. All in all it's pretty delicious and I am now a shake shack fan! Definitely will be back.",

Shake Shack got their start in 2004 in NYC and has expanded to over 130 stores in under 15 years. Sometimes when these restaurants explode like that they lose some of the qualities that originally made them so great. I actually had a nice evening at this location. This Shake Shack is in the Phoenix Uptown Plaza which is becoming a little mini foodie paradise with all the killer eats moving in. I went with my go-to item the SmokeStack burger. You can't go wrong with a burger topped with cherry pepper relish and applewood smoked bacon. I love the crinkle fries and got them with melted cheese but felt it really didn't make it any more special. The big complaint about SS has always been the prices. Just recently in the past ten years it became the norm to charge $7 to $10 for a burger at some of these new burger joints. I've learned to just accept it. Shake Shack makes a killer burger and the shakes are pretty amazing too. Tonight I got great customer service and lots of welcoming smiles from the employees. So hats off to this location for putting Shake Shack back on my good side.",

    "text": "I have been hearing about shake shack for years now . Being from the west coast , I was raised on In-N-Out , so I had some high expectations, especially since it had Bourdain's seal of approval. Now, I came in pretty late so for the sake of expediency I decided to just order a standard cheeseburger , fries and a shake combo for the sake of expediency and so the employees weren't waiting on me. On the drive home , I tried some fries , they were very good ;they reminded me of A&W before they sold  out. The shake was decent but not as \"custard-y\" as I was hoping , and it kind of had some ice chunks in it , which detracted from the creaminess I was expecting . Now , here is where it WENT SOUTH  for me , when I opened up the clamshell package , which had concealed the construction of the burger until I arrived home , it was a plain patty with cheese, on a dry bun. I opened it up to inspect ... NOTHING ON IT!! I'm not sure if it was a mistake or if this is what you get when you say \"cheeseburger\" here, but I can't think of one person who would order a burger with ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT ALL ON IT . Even if this is standard practice here , the cashiers need to ask customers if they would like standard condiments on it or have it constructed the way a picky 4 year old would order it . Since I went in late , the shack was closed so I couldn't go back. I'm going to return today and explain the situation and my opinions . They should at the very least offer me a replacement meal. And at best they should refund me and give me a meal on the house . Although it was plain and strange to receive a burger like this , the meat was cooked properly and had good flavor , and the bun was soft and actually delicious , so I think with lettuce tomato pickle onion and whatever \"spread\" equivalent they use here , it will be a decent cheese burger . They just need to Improve their employee training practices and be aware that they are going to get a lot of first timers (since To my knowledge it was a NY only establishment up until recently), so they need to inform the customer that unless instructed they are only getting a patty with cheese and nothing else . Also, it is substantially more expensive than In-N-Out . Almost 15 dollars for burger, fries, and a shake instead of around 8 dollars for the equivalent from In-N-Out. For now , I'm giving 2 stars because the bun and fries were good, and the meat was cooked medium/medium well and tasted decent . Hopefully I can change this to 4-5 stars later . I was extremely disappointed .",

I don't really get why there will be four employees having a social conversation at the same time tables need to be wiped down and clients are waiting for over 20 minutes for a burger and fries.  This is consistent across DC locations (Dupont Circle, Gallery Place, 14th Street or Tysons Mall).  Slow.  If the food weren't so tasty - I would never return. But if the service were more timely and friendly - I would probably be tempted to visit more frequently.",

I have a Taxonomic rank for these types of places.  I can not compare a Memphis BBQ to a Texas BBQ because they are different. The same is with burger places too.  I can not compare a Habit, Hamburger Works to a Zinburger different types of places.  Pretty much different sports.    When I say Shake Shack is good I am comparing to Five Guys, Freddys and Lennys.    Now to the food after my after my craziness eccentric mind tries to explain how I think.    The burger here is good.  They added a seasoning and it was good.  I got a bit of a salty bite, but just one.  The cheesy was nice and melted also.  The lettuce was fresh also.  The burgers are not large also.  I might recommend the double patty for the manly men.   The French fries were okay, but I did not come here for fries.    This place is good and I think most people will like it.  I am not sure what the hell a concrete is also.  I have to ask the next time I am there.    I did not notice any soda fountain or tea dispensers in the dining area also. I do not drink tea or soda, so I am not sure if refills are included.  If you are wondering what my favourite burger place is you will not find it.  It was the burgers we would make when hunting or doing varmint control with my father and family.  We would use finely minced steak meat with the fat or hamburger if we had it (space limited and hard to keep cold).    Nothing fancy was added just salt, pepper and onions.  Get what ever wood was laying around and start a fire and lay a grill over it.  Lay them patties on the grill and wait.  Watch the fat drip off never depressing them once.  If we had cheese that was a plus (some times keeping food cold was a challenge) ice chest were not a nice as they are now.  Lay a slice of bread on the grill to warm it up (no hamburger buns space was limited and slice bread can be used for sandwiches too).  A variety box of chips with the little bags.  Eating that burger under the stars was better than any place here in town.",

My boyfriend purchased our meals without issues, then either the manager or a cook came out and told my boyfriend that the mushroom was coated with bread crumbs: the associate didn't inform my boyfriend of this. My boyfriend requested to cancel the order with a refund to which the staff (who was visible based on the layout of the restaurant) mocked my boyfriend, laughed at him and rolled their eyes. No one apologized even as my boyfriend mentioned he could clearly see the disrespect of the staff.",

    "text": "I first heard about Shake Shack back in the early 2000's from friends in NYC so I was excited when they finally opened locations in Phoenix and Scottsdale.  The burgers, fries, and shakes are certainly good, but I wish they'd opened here years ago, because with the explosion of burger restaurants nationwide that is no longer an uncommon thing to find.   Hopdaddy, Habit, Smashburger, Five Guys, and In-N-Out all provide burgers that are equally as good and at a much more reasonable price. Heck, even The Counter in California seemed cheaper.  Sure it's fine to promote that you are from New York, but I'm not willing to pay New York prices for a burger that I'm still eating in Phoenix.  Overall Shake Shack is good, but overpriced.",

We had planned on sharing the fries, mushroom burger and a shake, but seeing how small the burger was, we each got our own. The fries didn't seem particularly appealing so we skipped them.  The mushroom burger was like a fun grilled cheese sandwich. The cheese oozed out with the first bite. It was good, but it needed more to it. For $7 and its reputation, I expected a little more \"wow.\" We also got a chocolate malt that was very average. Not bad but not exciting.",

I liked the atmosphere of the place, there's not much going and it's pretty simple and straight forward. I would give this place a 6/10 for overall experience.

Their burgers ARE good BUT the only thing that did deter me from trying anything else was the the entire menu is A La Carte... each item starts a little over $2.50 + tax. For an individual person, a drink, fries, and burger would set you back about $15 + tax, and you don't really get a sizable meal for the price...  I know they take great care in making their food though, and the employees were helpful and nice when we ordered. I wouldn't mind eating here again, but the prices... I feel like I could get a bigger meal at a sit-down restaurant than at a \"high-end\" fast food joint.  So.. fan of their food!! But not a fan of their prices haha!!",

    "text": "I lived in New York for a brief period in 2007, and as soon as I tried Shake Shack, I was hooked. I'm so glad they've finally made it it west!  Is Shake Shack pricier than typical fast food? Yes, but it's also not typical fast food, both in terms of food quality and the aesthetic atmosphere of the restaurant itself. How many fast food places outfit their restaurants with great patio space and tables made from reclaimed bowling alley wood from Brooklyn?  I've noticed a lot of reviews comparing Shake Shack to In-N-Out, Five Guys, Habit, even McDonald's. Are those places cheaper? Definitely. But I'd also venture to say the quality of Shake Shacks beef is far better. I'm not sure what seasoning Shake Shack uses, but the beef is far more flavorful to me than any competitor. When it comes to bun quality, Shake Shack wins that one hands down. The butter toasted Martin's potato roll is way better than buns used anywhere else. And if beef isn't your thing, the Chick'n Shack is amazing! I'm definitely more of a beef fan than chicken, but I've gotten the chicken my last two visits here. Super flavorful, crispy, and juicy- everything that most chicken sandwiches lack.  I know the French fry battle is always a hot topic, bu I also prefer the Shake Shack Yukon crinkle cut fries to any other burger place (save maybe the truffle fries at Zinburger).  One of the best part of Shake Shack is the beverage selection. Anywhere I can get a good glass of wine or a good beer is an automatic plus for me. I like that they feature local drafts on tap too. If you prefer your liquid indulgence in the sweet variety, the shakes and concretes here are also great. I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but I ended up drinking more than my share of the black & white shake my husband ordered. They've also got two concretes special to Phoenix. I've only had the Camelshack (salted caramel and banana cream pie), but it was really good.  What really pushes this location to five-stars for me is the service. Every worker I've encountered has been super friendly. They've even come buy to offer water or to clear the table- not something you see in most fast casual places.  If you're looking for the most food for the least amount of money, this is not your place. However, if you'd rather have a quality burger, in a nice atmosphere, and maybe enjoy a beer or wine with your meal, this is the place for you.",

Once again great food .  Price and take out are my once major negative   1. No call in to order food option,  now the burgers are not like the vig  or a fancy burger place , it's like five guys in a way but more options so I kind of feel like a call in option is warranted.  They have app but I'm not at the point to have an app for places I go to maybe once a month,  but I'm being picky   2. Prices , so these burgers and sandwiches are not big , they are kinda like sliders and I love sliders but once again 7 bucks for one is little much,  9 for double patty , and those are the standard normal ones. Now I think the burgers here are better than in and out with breathing room But not enough.    Any ways once again great tasting food , really great but price is my only issue.  Burger fries drink might run you 15 -20",

Well they gave me cheese for the fries which I was happy about. But then he also gave me fresh hot fries with cheese on top and also three cards for free shakes next visit. That is excellent customer service!! We live in Gilbert and came next door for a doctor appointment and we always stop here for lunch. Great customer service and great food!!!",

I decided to give the same Shake Shack location another try, especially with the day having better conditions. This time, I went with the Shack Stack burger (cheeseburger & Shroom burger) as well as their seasonal BBQ Bacon Cheese Fries; I was anything but disappointed his time around!  The burger had some seriously gooey (and Hot!) Cheese, which was just phenomenal. The fries were simply Divine with the mixture of the bacon and choice of cheese. This was no mere canned cheese from Smart & Final (big ups to S&F, though)..!  The cement and shakes will have to wait for next time, but there deffo will be a next time now!  So, yes.. I will admit my script got flipped compared to the initial review. But let it be known I still hate In N Out, as a Native Californian!",

I will tell you, I truly appreciate businesses that read our reviews and take action! If nothing else, it tells their customers that they truly care about our opinions and want to make sure we have a positive experience.   While this is not my first choice of burger joints, my Shake Burger was pretty good. The produce seemed fresh and the bun was delightful. My one area of critique is that my burger was a little overdone, but not too bad.  I must rave about their service. From the moment I walked in, the manager greeted me with a smile and a friendly hello. The cashier was very bubbly and made sure I got extra pickles, which made me super happy. Lastly, the manager stopped by, picked up my tray and asked if I wanted more water. I declined the water, but the gesture was awesome and truly appreciated.",

The staff was very friendly and welcoming, the food came out quickly and I enjoyed my meal.

Agree with other reviewers who said it was over prices for the amount of food. I love the quality of the ingredients but our burgers came out kind of squashed on their buns and with scant toppings. Just looked like a McDonalds quarter pounder. A bit salty too but cooked well and served hot. Fries were good. Got a black and white shake that was great but small for the price. I'd love it if they would add a turkey burger as I'm always searching for spots that serve a good one. I'm not sure we will come out of our way to eat here again, we'll see.",

I drove past this location last Feb. and was excited to see a sign announcing \"Shack Shack coming soon!\" We were in the area the first week of Jan. 2017 so made a point of stopping by.      We were greeted warmly upon arrival and asked if it was our first trip {must have been our deer in the headlights expressions.} The menu was explained and we went with two basic burgers with cheese and an order of the crinkle cut fries. Also we shared a chocolate shake.       The store was very attractive and well appointed. We were there after 1pm so parking was not an issue. Great geographic location.     Our food was good but not inspiring. I think sometimes the hype makes patrons expect more from a restaurant than is logical. A little expensive and greasy but definitely tasty fare.       We have been big In-N-Out fans during our AZ trips but would consider Shake Shack again.",

    "text": "Overpriced with long lines. The burgers are long the same lines of Habit Burger, 5 guys etc, but a lot more expensive. I guess a chain from New York has to have New York prices! They even keep the fountain drinks behind the counter so you can't get refills. That could be another reason why the service is so slow. Bottom line: the burgers are not worth the price.",

    "text": "With all the burger places that are around that are much better than this place. The fries are good the poor hot dog is nothing like Chicago Chicago never Grill the hot dog in its life I'm from there. And where's the seeds on the bun. This shake is Tiny for 550 is ridiculous and $0.50 extra for whipped cream. Dairy Queen across the street you can get for them for that same price. The double burger would be the same as a double double at In-N-Out at half the price period and a better taste. Thought I would give it a try not worth the hype you tried and you say I'm sure you'll be disappointed too. For the price we paid for dinner we could have got to filet mignons at AJ's and cook them at home and had a wonderful dinner",

Unfortunately we could not try the fries because they cook their chicken in the same frier.  I also sample the vanilla shack , good flavor but a bit pricey. The space is large and they have a nice patio.  I will go back hopefully they get a second frier so I can have GF fries.",

For two burgers, one order of fries and two shakes it cost $27.00. ouch.  In-N-Out burger is MUCH better and a better price.  $30 isn't expensive but... should be better quality.    Now, I would return for a Citrus Matcha shake in a heartbeat.  The staff was really friendly and they were well trained.    I do, however, plan to return for the chicken sandwich to try it out.  It will definitely NOT be a destination for me.",

Decor is upscale compared to similar frozen custard burger places.  Location is good for groups with big bench type booths and wide open indoor and outdoor seating.  The place is clean and staff friendly.  However for the quantity/size of food it's not worth going to this place over similar burger joints.",

    "text": "We had heard the hype.  My hairdresser related how he stood in line for hours to get in to the store in NYC and it was the best he had ever had.  Other folks I talked to were all worked up because it was a hip place.  We watched it being built as they updated and remodeled Uptown Plaza.  It was fun to see the place change from Boston Market to a Shake Shack.  When they first opened there would be lines around the building and the lunch crowd was huge.  We waited a while before we went and maybe that is why I have to say - MEH.  They definitely have NYC prices on the food - yikes!  I got a single Shack Burger which was mediocre.  The hubby had the Bacon Burger and felt the same.  We split a $2.99 order of fries expecting it to be large but it was barely enough for us!  Generic crinkle cut fries too.  I got an iced tea because I could not wrap my head around the $6 shakes.  The hubby got the shake of the day - chocolate cardamom - and it was small and again - MEH.  It is no where near the quality of burgers we've bad from local places like Wineburger or Hamburger Works.  Glad we tried it but doubt we will return.",

He was polite, my friend and I walked away. A group of people were getting out of their car as we were leaving and we informed them that the restaurant was closed. The group of 6 people headed in without issue and were able to enter into the line to order with no problem. I returned to speak to a manager and informed them of the situation. There was no resolve. I would like to add that my friend and I are African American and the group were Caucasians. I am very disappointed with this discriminatory experience, the behaviors displayed by employees of this establishment were totally unacceptable.",

Hubby  & I decided to order 2 splits ( half bottles) of red wine to enjoy with our meal. Huge mistake! The wine rang up at $29 a bottle! At a fast food burger joint!!?? Needless to say, we nixed that. Instead, we shared one split. That's like $14.50 a glass. One can get a pretty nice glass of wine for ten bucks in some fine dining establishments. Shake Shack is on the wrong track if they think folks are gonna pay that kind of money to eat a burger & have a glass of wine while little rug rats run around the place. Not this girl.",

In-n-Out Burger is just as good for a 1/3 of the price. Shake Shack is worth $6.00 at best. Adding fries and drink (which they dispense) makes a lunch nearly $11.00/person. Not worth it in my book.",
