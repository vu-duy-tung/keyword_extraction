Great food, great prices, speedy service...and always made to feel welcome by the friendly lady behind the counter.  I've even ordered food from here for a company luncheon event and everyone loved it.  Have taken many out-of-town guests here and everyone is always impressed w/the food.  I've been to many other Indian restaurants around the valley...but this is the one I always come back to.  The following are some of my favorites from this restaurant:  curry eggplant palak paneer malai kofta vegetable manchurian naan dosa",

Haha...  you had to order and pay before sitting down... which isn't my thing but whatever... no biggie.  they had an Indian Movie on which the employees seemed to be enjoying.  Ballywood baby!!!  Neway, on to the food.  So I got one of the lunch combos... I think it had: *curry with tofu (tasted like a tomato base, i liked it ok) *a rice dish with green beans (was kinda weird texture but good flavor) *another rice dish with potato (this one i liked the best, spices were nice) *2 broth-y soups (one was very spicy with not much else goin on, the other was good, not sure what the heck was in it though) *some kind of porridge dessert that was...meh.  tasted like really sweet cream of wheat with cream.  but it was cold and very gelatinous.  not my cup of tea.... and speaking of tea...  i also ordered a hot tea... but I should have asked what it was like cuz both Monty and I thought it was horrible.  it tasted like dirt.  no i don't eat dirt... but what i would imagine dirt would taste like with a few spices added and hot water.  eew.    three stars cuz its wasn't horrible over-all, but i prolly wouldn't go back.  i wish i liked it better... but even Monty, who loves Indian food said he's had way better... so he's on a mission to introduce me to better stuff!",

We ordered what we thought was enough, but actually the portions are very big.  We couldn't finish everything.  Unknowingly we over ordered.  No big deal.      It is a great place.  It is a more like a chat house rather than a formal restaurant.    If you want fancy spoons and forks and plates and a high bill, this is not the place for you.  Best and most of all, the food was EXCELLENT.    The food was so good I wanted to meet the owner and also had the privilege to do that as well.    As expected, a nice fellow with a pleasing personality.  Give it a try once.  You won't be disappointed.  Mike",

The restaurant is more of a order at the counter, fast food looking atmosphere. I ordered the gobi manchurian, and the paper masala dosai. Let me just say, the gobi manchurian is one of the best things I've put into my mouth. And it's vegan! The dosai came to our table, and it was unbelievably big. Humorously so. But really tasty. The staff was really friendly, and I can't get enough of the bollywood music videos. Really great food. Will be back.",

I am sure they will be happy to tone it down for you, but then, of course, you toning down your experience.   I loved it as is. Its awesome and i am sure as hell coming back!  PLEASE!!! P L E A S E do not listen to retards who bash this place for various stupid non-related shit!!! Stop by and try it.

Clean, Friendly and Affordable place unless you are there with a party of 10 and expect a happy Hour Environment. Don't be shy to ask the man behind the counter for something you need or any recommendations if unsure.   Start with Samosas with green and red chutni, then move on to Dosas (Masala or Plain) with Idli, Vada and Sambar. Try the Coconut chatni. A nice cold Mango lassi to go along the way and if you make it this far then nice Gulab Jamun or Kheer for Dessert.",

They do such an incredible job with the spices.  The owner is really nice, he remembers that I cannot eat raw onions.  They did not even know that they were nominated for best vegetarian restaurant this year in the New Times, it was just business as usual.  Do not go here expecting to have a fine dining experience, you order at the counter, either take it to go, or sit in the dinner atmosphere and eat some crazy good food!  Friendly atmosphere, lots of families in to eat.  Everything is great, but the paneer butter marsala is one of my favorites.",

Their mint chutney tastes fresh and delicious (and is not too spicy, for those who want it milder). And yes, who does not love a chutney bar? The guy at the counter is not super friendly, and the place is certainly not fancy. The food, however, is terrific! It is as good as any really good Indian restaurant (Indian food is my favorite!), and the service is very fast.

We figured it wasn't much of a date place, but have been searching for a good Indian food since our favorite closed months ago.  Woodlands did not disappoint. We ordered the paneer butter masala and the spinach dosai with a mango lassi. The lassi was delicious. I've been craving one for months. The paneer butter masala was creamy and thick, and delicious. We had never tried dosai before, and we were curious. This too was awesome. To top it off, they had also bagged some bread and chutney from the chutney bar. We didn't get to try to mint chutney; however, the white coconut chutney and tomato chutney were both very good.   There was also a soup in the bag. However, they had given us so much food, we were too full to try it. This place is delicious. I'm already eager to eat my leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Superb food, good portions, and good prices. Will definitely return.",

BEWARE: closed Tuesdays! (drove 2 hours from Chino Valley one time to find that out the hard way) Also, please note that \"South Indian\" means HOT. If you want it mild,you need to tell them. The owners are very sweet & attentive,as well as the Mexican waitress. Always packed full of Indian customers = authentic. The only Indian restaurant I found in AZ to compare to this one is the Govindas in Tucson. This is a family run business (the owners are the cooks,& you can watch them prepare the food) Best food,best price. Very clean. I love Indian food,& this place is great.",

The eating utensils are very small and very flimsy plastic. This is a deal breaker. I can forgive the non-friendly demeanor of the guy behind the counter, and the below par ambiance.

Not familiar with the words and being vegan, they helped us and changed our order to not have cheese or dairy which we appreciated very much.  Everything is served on paper or Styrofoam plates with plastic utensils. Even the water comes in Styrofoam.  Don't they know Styrofoam is not recyclable and stays in the land fill?  The food was just okay to me.  We had gone to Udupi in Tempe a week before and I was wanting to go back for their vegetable green curry.  Udupi is the same price, everything is labeled vegan, it is cafeteria style so you can taste everything if you want.  Woodlands was closer to home, but I'll gladly drive a few minutes farther to eat at Udupi!  Very upscale.  Woodlands compares to McDonalds.",

I'm gluten-free, so I double checked if it was made with flour. Happily, the lovely woman explained it was like a pancake made of lentils.

    "text": "Yes! Now this is some good south Indian food!  South Indian food is pretty different from North Indian food. Most people think of chicken tikka and palak paneer when they think of Indian food. South Indian food is almost always vegetarian, even vegan, and uses some different spices so the flavor can be pretty different.  Woodlands is small, the restaurant lacks ambiance, and the interior can be dirty. That being said, the food is fresh, well seasoned, and yummy. My favorite appetizer is iddly (steamed rice and lentil patties that are very simple in flavor but should be dipped in sambar, which is easily described as a spicy vegetable soup). Vada are deep fried pieces of lentil and flour dough that are also dipped in sambar.  For entrees, a masala dosa is a wonderful thin crepe like bread stuffed with potatoes (also served with sambar). Woodlands has lots of different types of dosa if you feel adventurous; I like the mysore masala dosa as it's a bit spicier. Vegetable uthappam looks like a big pancake and it's covered in veggies (again, served with sambar!). This is really yummy and filling.   I haven't had the other entrees here but I will definitely be trying the uppuma, channa batura, and poori masal. I would give this place 5 stars for food, especially in Phoenix where Indian restaurants are few and far between, but the dirty interior knocks it down a star. That being said, if you set reasonable expectations, I think you'll be glad you gave Woodlands a try.",

    "text": "I was craving some good, authentic Indian food, and this place is close to my work and has great Yelp reviews, so I went here for lunch today, Thursday, around 11:30 a.m. Let me tell you, it hit the spot!  Casual atmosphere: I ordered at the counter and then took a seat, where the food was brought to me.  There's a self-service station with water, plastic flatware, a variety of chutneys, raita and pickle. The food is served on disposable plates/bowls. There are a couple of trash cans around for customers to clean up after they're done.  The place was neat and clean.  Food: I ordered the 'Special Thali' lunch special and 'Malabar Parotta' side. I didn't wait long for my food, but I was also the only customer there.  Everything was DELICIOUS. The Special Thali came with an awesome mixed vegetable curry, a channa curry, rasam, sambar, only one chapati (but at least it was big), plain white rice, one plain papad, and one gulab jamun for dessert. I finished everything on my plate(s) except for some rice and rasam, but I'm not a big rasam fan to begin with.   The elusive 5th star: although I ordered 'Malabar Parotta,' what I received was not Malabar parotta but instead store-bought Malaysian paratha. Now, I love store-bought Malaysian parathas. In fact, I often have a family pack of them in my freezer that I feed my family periodically. So I had no problem gobbling up the yummy Malaysian parathas served at the restaurant. It's simply that I had my heart set on authentic Malabar/Kerala parottas that I haven't eaten in a long time, and I was excited to see it on the menu, so I was disappointed that I didn't get what I ordered.  Menu: The menu on their wall may be a little different than their paper & website menu because there wasn't a 'Special Thali' on the wall menu but a 'South Indian Thali' offering a slightly bigger food/drink variety. I'll ask about that the next time I'm there.  Future visits: Would I go back? Absolutely! I'm looking forward to trying out the rest of their menu.",

We love Indian food and have been slowly working our way to all of the restaurants near us. This place was THE best. It might be the best I've ever had. We ordered palak paneer, malai kofta, and dal curry. YUM! It was the right level of spicy. It was also beautiful to look at, especially the dal. I adored the veggie dumplings in the malai kofta, spectacular texture and taste. My mouth is watering just thinking of the leftovers in my fridge and I just had breakfast. I actually called the restaurant back after we ate last night to tell them how much we loved the food. Tomorrow we are having people over specifically so we can order this again to share. Highly recommend this place. The entrees are a couple dollars cheaper than other Indian places around, and it's much much better. (Shhh, don't tell them they could raise their prices and I'd still buy it!) Have never actually eaten in the restaurant. It doesn't seem like anything fancy, but I promise you won't care once you taste the food.",

Woodlands is a vegetarian South Indian restaurant located in Chandler, Arizona about 20 minutes south of Phoenix.  When we arrived, we immediately realized it wasn't all I thought it would be. Located in a strip mall, it was a tiny little take-out joint with inside seating for about 20. We took a look at the menu and were pleased to see items that were marked \"vegan\" so we ordered and took a seat at a booth. The restaurant had a plain interior with cheap tables and black chairs. Towards the back, there was a toppings bar with lots of options. We chose the hot peppers to add to everything we had ordered and waited for our food.  We started with the Iddly steamed rice and lentil cakes. These plain, mostly flavorless cakes were served with a somewhat-runny sauce that left much to be desired. That's not to mention that everything was served on styrofoam plates, which I only tend to see in cities in the middle of nowhereland. So weird.  For our entrees, we ordered two curries. I had the Vegetable Curry that had green beans and cauliflower in a coconut-tomato-based curry. My friend ordered the Dhall Curry, which had lentils with mustard, cumin, and spices. Neither of them were anything special.  And we also asked for super spicy, but they weren't spicy at all.  We also ordered the Parotta Kurma, which turned out to be really odd. They took the bread and sliced it up into pieces, then put a red curry on it. The bread was chewy and slightly spicy, but just odd.  All in all, it wasn't worth the drive out. The guy at the counter wasn't very helpful or personable. The meal was mediocre at best. And the entrees at $8.50 each really could be priced less for what we received. Oh, and the styrofoam and paper plates for those dining in the dining room were pretty tacky.",

    "text": "Horrible experience. Can't understand the high ratings. I am from south India and grew up this kind of food. First of all its criminal to make chutney, leave it out in a bar (esp. cocunut) and expect people to go get it. Next, all their food is served in styrofoam plates and plastic cups - that too tiny in size. I recommended a friend of mine (US guy) to have a \"thali\" so that he could have a more complete experience. Their \"thali\" came in a stack of two styrofoam plate layers. It was a joke. No one (incl. me) knew how to eat the food. To call this a south indian restaurant will be a criminal offense. Their lassis were untouchable. Extremely sour from having left outside and probably spoilt. To use Woodlands name and make a mockery of it is so sad.",

The Veggie Curry had a delicious sauce and lots of fresh tasting vegetables. It comes with a side a white rice and we used the Malabar Parotta (bread) to mop up the rest of the tasty sauce. The Chenna Batura looks like a huge sopapilla and comes with a garbanzo beans curry. This was a big hit w/the teenage boys who hogged it all. The Masala Uthappam was good, but the least favorite among us all. It's described as a rice & lentil pancake. It looked like a pizza and came with a sauce to dip it in. I wish I had heard about this place sooner. Excellent food... can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Masala Dosai and samosa chaat are legit. Good tasting food, authentic flavor.  I drive to Artesia (Pioneer Blvd) sometimes just to fulfill my Indian veggie food cravings (ok not really, but I do visit every time I'm in LA). This place compares favorably to those places. They have some interesting dishes that are like whitified versions of masala dosai, like, pav bhaji dosai? Maybe this really exists in India, I don't know, I wasn't born there and I haven't been there, but I'd like to think I'm very well connected with my parents culture. I appreciate my Indian heritage and culture. Anyways, I was surprised that the pav bhaji dosai was actually really good. Sambar is decent too. Chutney bar is good, but I think its a little lacking.  Service is kind of, I don't know, not very welcoming. Typical Indian style. If you're Indian, I think it will suffice, but if you aren't you'll be weirded out.   Phoenix really lacks south indian food places, this place somewhat makes up for that. Pricing though is not very appealing at all. ~$10 for a dosa with sambar is WAYYY too pricey. so much so that this might deserve a 2-star, but i gotta show some love for indian food.",

    "text": "I am South Indian by background.  Parents are from South India.  This food is very similar to what my grandmother, from Kanniyakumari, would make....just that my grandmother would not make as elaborate sometimes.    If you were to ask me about the food, I would say it is good, but my grandmother cooked better :-)!!  As far as what my wife and I ate, here is the breakdown:  1) I had a Mysore Masala Dosai.  This is very traditional from the Mysore area in India, where my mother's side of the family hails from.  The dosai was very similar to what I would eat in India, though a bit more elaborate  2) My wife, who is Vietnamese by background, ordered the Spinach Dosai.  She said it was good, as she is used to South Indian food.  I never really did see spinach dosai in India before though.    Regardless, if a person is adventurous, and you are not expecting the standard North Indian Mughlai fare, this place is worth going to.  I would go back. The atmosphere is more like a fast food, or cafeteria, but the food is good.  I do not want to compare it to elsewhere, as even I would say other places I have lived in the USA, including Chicago, have South Indian restaurants that can perhaps compete with this place and win.  For the Phoenix area, this is good though.",

This place has lots of Vegan options which are clearly labeled on the menu which is just divine for me. Regardless, if you are a vegetarian or not this is some of the best indian food I have ever tasted. I think the dosai is expensive but it tastes very good like everything.   Recommend the Chenna Batura, Poori Masal, Samosa, Mango Lassi and if you get curry or vegetables don't forget to order the parotta!@",

    "text": "The food tastes okay but the service is bad. Let me cite a couple of experiences (each with a different person): 1. A couple of days back, I ordered for pickup and noticed after reaching home that the dessert was missing. I called to let them know and all that he said was \"Oh, sorry sir, I was talking to someone and forgot to pack it.\" I was surprised that he gave no offer whatsoever to try to make up for the mistake. I was going to say that I would take it the next time I go there but he hung up before I could complete! 2. While ordering two Dinner Grill Thalis, one for my wife and one for myself, I went back and forth a couple of times with substituting the Masala Dosa with a different dosa that costs the same. This was because my wife told me she wanted something else as she heard me order for her and then she said she'd go with what I ordered first. As I apologized for changing it twice albeit within seconds, the owner said quite rudely that this would be the last time! He said \"I am allowing you to substitute and you are changing!\" Firstly, he had told me in the past that they do accept substitutions for Dinner Grill Thali although not for the lunch grill thali and the Dosas were all the same price so he need not have made it seem like a huge favor! Secondly, I changed before he finished taking the order and the restaurant wasn't busy at all at that time!  At $8 for dosa, the prices are somewhat on the higher side considering that it is a self-service restaurant with styrofoam plates. But the Grill thalis (combos) are a good deal.",

We also got a side of #57 Malabar Parotta (bread/naan) which is to die for and could be a meal in itself.   We were both so impressed with portion size (left overs came home for a much anticipated lunch the following day), flavor (loved the chutney bar), and friendly service. The gentleman on multiple occasions queried about or satisfaction.   I give this place a very solid 4; maybe 4.5. The only thing that would make it better in my opinion is the ability to order an Indian beer and if the prices were a little lower. The atmosphere is on the casual, informal side which I like. Our dinner was $20 for 2 with leftovers. Very reasonable for dinner for two.",

You order at a counter, take a seat, and your food is brought out to you. Pitchers of water are self-serve and there is of course a soda fountain. There is also a chutney bar where you can explore to your heart's content. We brought a sample of each back to the table. Each were delicious and fresh.   I got the palak paneer, which was delicious. My friend ordered one of the giant table-sized dhosas, of which they were happy to tone down the spice at her request. All in all, everything was great. The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was the plastic... everything. Our food was served in dixie bowls and all the silverware was plastic. It sort of felt like we were camping.

Especially when there's not even a bare attempt to meet the same standards.   Anyway, Chandler's Woodlands serves primarily South Indian dishes. For the unfamiliar and unadventurous, there are also North Indian dishes on the menu (various curries, samosas, chole bhatura, etc.). There's no real atmosphere to speak of. You walk up to the counter, place your order, and receive your food on paper plates with plastic forks and knives.   I had the pav bhaji dosa, and some sambar-vada, both classic South Indian entrees (except that pav bhaji is a North Indian twist to the South Indian dosa concept). The sambar was bland, and not very interesting. It lacked the rich flavor that I expect, and was more watery than it should be. The dosa was fine. Because dosa is eaten with sambar, the bland sambar dampened my enthusiasm for the otherwise okay dosa.   The saving grace here is the prices, which are fair for the mediocre quality, lack of service, lack of atmosphere, and plasticware.",

    "text": "Woodlands is a run down looking fast food restaurant on the outside but a hidden gem of delicious flavors. I fell in love with the southern indian food here because of the rich and full bodied flavors that their chutney and dosa fillings have. I highly recommend any of the Dosa as the crepe ingredients are crispy and fluffy at the same time. It also comes with a soup with some lentils and spices. The soup is one of the highlights of the dish which pairs well with the excess crepe. I have personally had the tomato and the potato and onion varieties which were both fantastic. I would like to try their rice dishes in the future, as my memory has eluded me when it comes to the curry dish I tried months ago since the dosa stand out much more. The prices are fair for 1 item since you'll probably pay somewhere close to $10 per individual. My only qualm is the fact that the water is near a trash can by the back and the chutney on the sides usually look like they have been there for a while. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoy the food.",

One can taste that everything on the menu is made from sctrach vs using canned junk. My 3 year old loves their paneer dosa, idli, all types of rice & chikoo milk shake.  The owners are friendly and always have a smile on thier face and greet the customers & make them enjoy their meal. Bottom line is this is the best restaurant in the valley that serves fresh tasty authentic food .",

It is a Basic Maintenance place - they serve their food in Plastic Plates and coffee in Plastic / Styrofoam cups ( Yes i am not a fan of it too )  BUT - if you a True South Indian food lover , this should be your Go - To place.  They have the yummiest ghee Roast Dosa's and softest Idli's. Their Crispy Vada's are to die for and is my personal all time favorite. Their Grill Thalli Special offers all of these plus a dessert and coffee/tea for 10 $ at Dinner Time. Simply Love it !  They also have the best Sambar loaded with veggies.  Tasty Coconut chutney and spicy tomato chutney are offered as sides and one can get as many refills as they wish.  Being an authentic udipi restaurant - they Bisibele bath and Veg Pulao also is really good.",

It's a pretty plain joint (not too big on the decorations, you'll note), but the food is outstandingly flavorful.  Now don't be fooled and think that just because it's vegetarian that it is going to be completely 'healthy'... that is a very common mis-conception and can really eff up your 'diet' if you have that mindset and eat at places like this frequently.. cuz I tell ya, they are pretty generous with not only the portions, but to give food some sustenance, you can bet they use cream or ghee (basically butter) to thicken sauces up and the likes.  This food is flavorful, for sure, but low in calories it is not.  I have tried a few of their Thalis (basically sampler dishes which lets you try a variety of things in one sitting and in smaller portions, but still really filling), the Palak Paneer, the Currys, the Aubergine dish called Bharwan Baiga, Gobi Manchuria.. they were all super delicious... though the Aubergine dish is still my favorite!  Plan on taking leftovers... oh yeah, and the prices are pretty decent and the staff is pretty good, too.",

Sometimes, I can pick around dishes that do have onions, but this was just jam packed with it. I realize I could've asked what sort of vegetables were in the dosa, but their menu offered very little explanation. The palak paneer was good...but lacking in paneer...we had about 4-5 pieces in our dish. It was also much too spicy for my liking.   When we left the venue, our insides were on fire and felt as if we needed to chug ice cold water to tone it down. We were full, but not satisfied...  I do love that they have a chutney bar and plenty of water pitchers for customers to pick up on their own.  Ambiance and service quite spotty. I don't think we'll be returning, but still glad we gave it a try!",

We love the food that has become harder and harder to find in the area.  Prices are on the high side for the fast food kind of setup they have, but I will pay for the quality and... I am not a fan of disposable Styrofoam they use for everything.",

    "text": "This cute place on ray road serves authentic south indian fare.It's vegetarian and reasonably priced. They serve more than 10 varieties of Dosa.The Pav bhaji (rice crepe with pav bhaji masala and onions) and Mysore masala (rice crepe with spicy chutney,potatoes and onion) are my favorites.All Dosa's are $7.99. I recommend trying the Mysore masala if you can handle a little heat.  We also got the South Indian Thali for $9.99.It comes with rice,sambar,rasam,three types of curry,pappadum,tea/coffee and sweet.For sweet they gave me Gulab jamun (which i love). The chutney bar is nice.The portions are generous,you can also order the thali's to go.  They would totally be 5 stars if they could get rid of those styrofoam plates because i feel it gets really messy especially if you are eating the Thali. The interior is basic nothing fancy but the food i would say is very close to Home.  Cheers!",

    "text": "I think I got this restaurant confused with another one initially because I was expecting a buffet. When I walked in and saw there was only a chutney bar I didn't mind too much since there were lunch specials and the menu looked intriguing. Since a lot of Indian restaurants here serve North Indian style cuisine it was a nice change of pace to try South Indian style dishes.  There are currently 3 different lunch specials. Quite honestly at the time I didn't know half of the dishes that were listed on it but I got #5 special thali lunch simply because it had the largest number of items. :) The #5 ($7.50) includes rice, chapati, sambar, rasam, porial, kootu, papadum, and dessert. I asked for it to go and it was made in just a few minutes. I also looked up the what each dish was so I could identify them later. :)  Each dish had a distinct flavor and was good with either the rice or the chapati flat bread. I enjoyed the spicy bold kick of the sambar soup, the delicate taste of the kootu lentils, and the mixed vegetable porial was probably my favorite of all the dishes. The rasam soup was a little too sour for my tastes, but that's just me.  Dessert was a delicious sweet mango(?) pudding with very thin, dark noodles. Very unique and the first time I've had this particular dessert!  I also ordered a mango lassi which was a sizeable portion, with rich, tart mango and yogurt flavor.  Sadly I did not receive any papadum (thin crispy lentil wafers) with my order but I was pretty stuffed eating only half of my order anyways so it didn't matter too much.  Overall I loved the food here and they aren't afraid to kick up the spice level. I'll definitely be back!",

Chilli porotta was like porotta in a gravy and was not the consistency generally expected in the dish. On the whole, never going back to this place.",

I had an Onion Chilly Uthappam Rice & Lentil Pancake.  It was dark and nearly burned.  I contemplated sending it back but, I didn't want to risk pissing off anyone.  The over-cooking made it dry and flavorless.  $10 of disappointment.  Husband tried it and felt the same way about it.  Aside from the food, the people were friendly and pleasant.  They use paper plates and plastic cutlery so trying to cut the pancake with a plastic knife was a challenge, almost impossible.  The place is set up like a fast food restaurant.  There is a garbage by the door.  You are expected to remove your own dirty dishes and toss them on your way out.  We will probably go again (I loved the bread) but, next time, I'll just tell them not to over cook the food.  Actually, I think it was grilled.  There was no excuse for burning it - so dark brown and dry.  I was short of charcoal but, really!  There were only two other people in the restaurant, that had already been served, at one table.  So where was his attention?  It could not have been that he had too many customers to handle.  He had none.  Mid way through our meal, more people arrived.  Husband liked his curried vegetable dish well enough.  I tasted it.  It was okay but, I cannot say that it was anything special.",

He did not allow me to order from the kids menu, as I was not under 10 yrs. Yes, he was that desperate and disgusting. Even when I told him that the big dosa is too heavy for me, he didnt budge. Now for the food. Being from Bangalore and Udupi muself, I really know this kind of food. Its like eating a hot-dog when you go into an Italian restaurant. Chutneys cannot be stored for a buffet. Its impossible with the rate at which coconut degrades. Except the tomato one. So your not eating chutney, but just some stale mustard sauce. The food is so lame, I dont know what to say. But the perfect recipe to fool Americans and desperate Indians. Its also too spicy for American standards and thats too bad. Oh and avoid their frozen lassi, its nothing like a mango. India is famous for alphonso mangoes, but this is soooo horrible. Better off at buying mangoes from Costco and eating it raw.",

I cannot tell you what I ate since my friend did the ordering, but everything was really good.  We had chick peas, a huge bread that took up most of the table, and \"hamburger buns\" with tasty potato filling.  I am sure I can close my eyes, point at something on the menu and still find the dish enjoyable.  Expect a very casual restaurant where you order at the counter and eat from disposable plates.  This would also be a great place to order take out from.",

I typically get the Special Thali which comes with different items to dip and eat the rice, chapati (flatbread), and papadam (big crispy wafer) that it comes with. It also includes a sweet dessert, mine came with carrot halwa which was so tasty and had perfect sweetness.   One of the best things about Woodlands Kitchen is their chutney bar! Mint, Tomato, and Coconut chutney were fresh tasting and delicious, with a great kick of heat. Tamarind was a lovely sweet and sour. Each added different flavors to my meal. I walked away stuffed and happy. Food comes out quickly so definitely a good pick for a quick, casual bite.  I will be back frequently to get their Grill Thali lunch special, which comes with a Masala Dosa. As well as the various other dishes on their menu!",

We ordered the Mysore Masala Dosa, Sambhar Idly, and a Pav Bhaji Dosa here. All of them tasted like how my mom would make it. Not too oily, and having good flavors. The food didn't taste bland either, which is hard to find in South Indian places around here. I loved their sambhar as well, which is what I usually die for whenever I go to a restaurant. Their Pav Bhaji Dosa was like the south Indian style Pav Bhaji dosa, where the curry isn't as flavorful as regular Pav Bhaji you find elsewhere, but the point is to highlight the flavor of the curry with the dosa and sambhar as well and not just the curry. Meaning its not supposed to be like just eating pav bhaji because it isn't!  I am a huge fan of the place and will definitely be back! The owner is extremely nice and will make sure to take good care of you :)",

    "text": "I really need to come here more often - it's just so far from my house! Unlike the other counter-serve Indian places near me, Woodlands is 100% vegetarian, and has always clearly marked the vegan items on the menu. And - most items are vegan!  The restaurant is not fancy - it's almost like you're eating at someone's house when their daughter is around helping out at the register. But, don't let that deceive you. The food is top notch. To start, the self-serve chutney bar rocks - it's like an Indian salsa bar. The tamarind chutney is a stand out. It's thicker than most, and full of flavor. And it's perfect for their very delicious, clearly fresh-made samosas. Woodlands' samosas are more mild than some I've had, but they're large and tasty.  Woodlands is dosai heaven! I normally get the pav baji dosai. It's a thin rice crepe with a layer of what seems like masala-flavored mashed potatoes and peas. It's got a slight bit of heat, but it's not overwhelming. It's served with a very spicy rasam soup. I've had their vegetable curry in the past too - and it brings the heat!   The food can be a little greasy sometimes, so take it easy on the fried items. Service is always prompt and the portions are so big I can usually get a second meal out of them.",

Woodlands' Yelp reviews were favorable, so I checked it out. #noregerts   I ordered the South Indian thali and it was HUGE and SO DELISH. It's literally the size of two meals! The food was generally spicy, but in a well-seasoned, rather than heavy-handed, way. I've got tomorrow's lunch and probably a snack left over, too! Insane value for under $15 (even after tip!).   Great service over the phone and at pick-up. No empty tables (8:45 p.m. Friday). The interior is modest, bright and welcoming.  If I lived in the PHX area, I would for sure be a super regular customer!",

I understand that the prices have gone up for all goods and groceries due to inflation in a booming economy. But the combination of increasing the prices AND reducing the portions does not bode well, at least not with me. The portions of the thali dinners have gotten so small (while increasing price by about 15-20%) that the 2-person portion now equals the 1-person portion from just a few months ago. I used to go there quite a few times every month, but not any more. I feel cheated. Their quality of the food has not changed and same with the service.",

In the meantime, you can grab some chutneys (coconut, tomato, mint) for your food and also gather utensils, water, and napkins.   In terms of the food, I have to admit that everything was super good. I had the grill thali (1 idli, 1 vada, 1 masala dosa, 1 sweet, and either coffee or tea) and my mother had the paneer onion dosa without the onion. The dosas were done to perfection, crispy without being overly crunchy with a really nice buttery taste. The chutneys were all really good, my favorite being the mint chutney!   It's really a no frills type of place so go in with these expectations and enjoy the food! Prices are fair and definitely worth the quantity.",

Yummy. I think this place is quite tasty, but I won't come here often, just due to the fact that it's a major carb overload, and I wish the dhosas weren't quite so expensive (I think they're about $7.50 for one?).

As a recently converted vegan, I have been shy to leave the house and try eating out, as I am hesitant to trust that all ingredients are vegan.  As it turns out, Woodlands is perfect for people like me!  They have a vegan coded menu, where all vegan dishes are marked with a star, making it that much easier to determine what's \"safe\" for me to eat.  They have delicious drinks prepared for the mango-lover.  They also have Pepsi products in a fountain.  They use styrofoam plates and cups.  The staff are friendly and prompt.  Our hot dishes were brought to our table 5 minutes or so after ordering.  I sampled three sauces from the chutney bar.  I loved all three!  The green one was spicy and the red one is a creamy tomato.  The black one is like a tamarind sauce with a pop of sour fruit taste.  We ordered Poori bread, which comes with two HUGE puffs of fresh bread!  We couldn't finish it!  The potato dosai was out-of-this-world-good.  If you like aloo naan bread, you will really enjoy this dish!  My friend ordered the eggplant curry, and it was as delicious if not better than my dosai.  Wow!  I am planning to come back again this weekend with the boyfriend.  So delicious!  I can't stop raving to everyone about it!  As a person who enjoys \"medium\" spiced foods, I was very happy with the level of spicy-ness in the dishes we ordered.",

    "text": "NOTE: Ignore the reviews above. It looks as if there is some deliberate attempt by the Udupai owners to pose as members and bash this place. Yes, this owner used to own Udupai Cafe and Udupai Cafe is another dosa house that competes with this eatery.  If you read my other reviews, you know that I'm critical and  my attention to detail is there so I'm not one of these people who likes every place he eats at.  Positives I'm Indian and I can assure you this place is good. I have never been to Udupai Cafe but based on its failing health inspections, I would be scared to eat there. Woodlands is a nice CLEAN eatery in a nice part of Chandler.  It's not a restaurant.  It's basically a Dosa shop. They  specialize in Dosa and offer several types. They also have excellent Indian Chinese dishes.   The food is consistently good and I have eaten there on several occassions.  This is a lunch/light dinner place.  Don't think of this place like a restaurant.  There are several types of Dosa and that's what this place specializes in.  The restaurant is also modern and not is some ghetto strip mall so don't worry about failing health codes here...at least not for a while.  Negatives Their non-South Indian dishes are not so good. For non-Indians, they should be informed that this is a Dosa house so order dosa and other south Indian dishes.  Don't order your typical Indian restaurant favorites like palak paneer (it wasn't good here).   The owner also says every dish is excellent which isn't True; he is kind of a businessman so he doesn't really care about telling you which dishes stand out.  Stick to the Dosa and the Vegetable Manchurian.  Their mango shake wasn't very good. Their chiku shake is great.",

    "text": "I am of Indian origin, so I am picky about Indian food at restaurants. I don't eat out much at Indian places, so I haven't tracked ownership changes or what that has done for Indian cuisine.   I ordered the malai kofta, which was $8.50. Might have been reasonable if it had come with a decent portion of rice. And had more than 3 kofta balls in that tangy sauce. Or if the extra rice in a thimble wasn't $1.50! I have had giant food portion for $10 at sit down restaurants with amazing ambience. I am not saying the place is expensive, just that the portion was way too tiny even for cheap places. You have to order at the counter, eat off flimsy paper plates that tip over at the slightest touch and clean up after you BUT there is a large tip blank on your bill which you have to sign in front of the attendant. And if you eat at Indian restaurants, you know well about the service that leaves you squirming. Woodlands was no exception.   The chutney bar was a decent idea - the tomato chutney was actually good. I have sort of given up on decent sambhar or chutney. I suggest taking the effort to drive out a couple more miles to Little India in Tempe. For 5.99, you get that same quanity of subji, two rotis, large portion of pulav and pickle.",

The two employees were really slow to take our order yet the food came to our table as soon as we got a pitcher of water and a sample of each thing from the chutney bar.  You bring your own pitcher of water and your own plastic forks and spoons to the table.  We went in starving and left stuffed.  It seemed that more experienced couples ordered just one dinner combo and shared.  That would have made more sense once I saw the amount of food we had.  Plus it would have cost less.  We got no drinks for appetizers and the meal was $21.  I loved the crepe thing with potatoe in it.  Since the menu doesn't really have descriptions I don't know what I ate but everything tasted okay.  I didn't love most of it and I didn't really hate anything.  Not sure I would go back.  It felt almost buffet style without you choosing which things from the buffet you want.  I prefer other Indian Restaurants.",

I'm intolerably picky about lighting, so we took ours home.  And we just kept pulling containers out of the takeout bag with incredulous expressions.

Since I refuse to believe the later, I was VERY happy with this place. Great place for dosa...finally I don't have to make it myself :) Seriously legit dosa!  We ordered rasam, the Grill Thali and a rasmalai. The Grill Thali is about $10 and is a good start if you want a general idea of what to order in the future. It came with masala dosa, idlli, vadai, sambhar, and a sweet (gulab jamun)... great value for what you get. The masala dosa was on par, vadai was made well, idlli was a bit dense and dry, sambhar was flavored well, and gulab jamun was not frozen (I've found way too many places that store it in the freezer and it kills me every time!). The spice level of the rasam was good but felt like it was missing something, possibly tamarind. The rasmalai was made well, but a little bit sweeter than I'm use to. All this for approx $16 for 2...My tummy was happy!  Woodlands is not the best place ever, but the dosa was good enough to make me want to come back to try the other types of dosa. Everything else was satisfactory and edible. I've noticed a lot of ppl critiquing the decor, but heck, it looks like a lot of the great places in Artesia (the little India area located in L.A.) so please don't come here if you're going to be critical of the cafeteria style.",

There is no appreciable (or even noticeable) ambience. The process is: Pay the bill then get the food. No specific seating arrangement. Served in plastics.

I, on the other hand, just stick to what I know and love and crave: the vegetable manchurian. It's spicy, delicious, deep fried vegetables with a nice cold dipping sauce on the side. The price is great for the awesome amount of food you get (one order is usually two dinners for me, sometimes more!). Ambience is lacking, but we tend to take our food to go. I just wish they'd open a location closer to Tempe!",

    "text": "This place has the yummiest Indian food I've tried so far (in SF/bay area & in PHX). It's all vegetarian, which is good, because it's really hearty fare - you'll walk out feeling overstuffed! I usually get either the dosa special or the grill special, both of which are like a mini-buffet for one (includes the main dishes, dessert, and for dinner, tea/coffee.) The dosa special is exactly the same for lunch & dinner, so I usually get it for lunch, and the grill one is better for dinner (a couple of extra sides compared to lunch.)  At lunch, sometimes the chutney bar isn't completely ready yet, but it's always been stocked at dinner time. Also, the focus is definitely on the food and not the decor or tableware. The one odd thing about this place is that the kitchen staff seems to speak in Spanish... I'm assuming that the food is more authentic than not though since I'm usually the only non-Indian there at dinner time...",

To start, the ambiance is non-existent, so if you want to impress a girl on a first date, this isn't the place. However, if you want to eat food that \"wows\" you, Woodlands is the place to come.  I ordered the samosa as an appetizer, and then the veggie curry, along with an order of malabar parotta bread. The samosa had so many spices in it that it was great on its own, however, there are plenty of delicious chutneys to choose from ( I loved the mint and coconut, there was also a spicy one with chunks of veggies in it that was good).   The curry was fantastic, spicy and full of flavor. I get annoyed when I order spicy in an Indian restaurant, and then after looking at me they serve it to me mild - Not here, it was just right. The bread was excellent too, so was the mango lassi, though I really wanted a Taj Mahal - No alcohol here!   So besides the cafeteria environment and no alcohol or table service, this place is great, because they serve great food.",

    "text": "This restaurant was recommended to be years ago by a native Indian but I didn't get around to trying it until now.  My bad because the food was awesome!  I hadn't had South Indian food since actually being in India in 2006 so this was a real treat for me!  I ordered the Malai Kofta (I'm a creature of habit, this is what I almost always get), a side of Iddly and the Paper Masala Dosai.  The spice was just right, hot enough to make me sweat but not real Indian hot which is slightly too much for me.  The dosai was thin and crispy on the edges and spongy in the middle - perfect!  My only complaint is that the malai kofta was a little chewy (slightly overlooked maybe) but the sauce was so delicious that it hardly matters.  They give you a ton of food too.  I'll probably be eating delicious leftovers for two days.  Definitely a place I would go to again!!  Oh and they had freshly made jelebis that were SO good!  My fiance and I devoured the entire package.  Edited to add: The second time I ordered Malai Kofta the lentil balls were perfect and not at all chewy.  This is definitely my new favorite Indian restaurant!",

    "text": "This is top-notch, delicious food.  My friend from Mumbai told me that it is as \"authentic as you can get here in the US\" and I believe her.  Here's the thing:  heretofore I couldn't eat Indian food, whereas my wife would have had it fed to her intraveneously if possible.  Now, when we go to Woodlands, I eat everything and LOVE IT!!!!  Paneer is phenomenal.  Chenna Battura (sp?) brings a tear to my eye just thinking about it.  I have ordered, devoured, and thoroughly enjoyed about 3/4 of the menu.    To further expound:  I could give a crap about ambiance, as long as I am not in a dangerous or filthy place.  Woodlands is immaculately clean and in an upscale Chandler location.  Really could not care less about the lack of interior decor or the fact that they use styrofoam cups and plates (which, from what I understand, is a significant \"upgrade\" from what you can expect in a South India marketplace).  Not here for a luxurious dining experience.  Just to eat.  And eat I do, in a clean, friendly, well-served location that offers delicious, authentic Indian food.  PS:  if you ever travel outside the US you'll find that about 98% of the world doesn't eat in restaurants like our spoiled fat butts--they eat in a market or order from street vendors.  Compared to this, Woodlands is off the chart in terms of luxury and taste.  And, again, compared to all other Indian food (which I could not eat before), this is the best.  Prices cannot be beat.  GO THERE AND CHECK IT OUT!!!!",

The Masala was wonderful - creamy, savory, extra tomato-y, and a little bit spicy, which was perfect. I ordered the veggie soup for my lady who was sick that night, and it ended up being the ideal thing. Delicious broth, not too spicy, kind of like the Indian equivalent of a good chicken noodle soup. But vegetarian. We will absolutely be ordering from Woodlands again - what a nice introduction to the Phoenix area!  EDIT: We've just ordered take-out from Woodlands again (probably will happen pretty often) and got the Vegetable Curry which was nearly as fantastic as the Masala. The order came with a couple yummy sides: a yogurt sauce and a gingery concoction. We also got the lentil soup this time and wanted to post a WARNING to fellow Yelpers: This soup is SO SO SO SO SPICY, I absolutely love spicy food and couldn't finish it. Not for the faint of heart!",

    "text": "Trust me, you don't go here for the ambiance (there is none). Well, unless you count the tons of Indians who frequent the joint or the occasional office troupe that takes over one corner, or the couples in for dinner... well basically it's a good place for anyone. What makes Woodlands stand out from the other Indian places in Chandler (some that DO have 'ambiance') is that Woodlands brings the heat. The chutney bar has a white coconut chutney that both cools and has a slight kick, a red tomato chutney with a low soft burn and good flavor, and my personal favorite, the green mint chutney that will knock your socks off. I only come here for the Dosas, the Masala Dosa and the Mysore Masala Dosa are both very good.  It seems to me that they use frozen vegetables, but the masala has never tasted bad so there's really no downside. Everything is nice and hot when they bring it out, although sometimes the sambar (a soup-like dish) might not be if it wasn't as freshly made. Their vadas (spicy, savory fried lentil cakes) are pretty good too. I haven't tried much else but why deviate from what works? The owner is really nice and will chat with you on what to get, family history, etc if you want. I wish they were open later (and on Tuesdays!)  If you're used to sit-down 'classy' restaurants and waiter service, well, you might find this place 'lacking' but honestly, these sorts of places focus on what matters - what's on your plate rather than what's on the wall.  This IS pretty much as good as it gets in Chandler...",

    "text": "In the months since I have found this place I have eaten here more than once a week.  I think even if you are not vegetarian they have the best food on this side of town.  The staff are very nice and the orders are filled promptly whether you eat in or carry out.  I have brought all of my friends and family here it is so good.  We have a  running joke that you can just point to the menu and get something.  The real standouts to try are:  - Gobi Manchurian - deep fried cauliflower - Chenna Batura - Chickpea Curry - Spring Dosa - rice and lentil crepes - Potato Bonda - breaded potato dumplings like samosas.  The place isn't super fancy. It's a simple strip mall restaurant with really friendly people.  I don't find this place very expensive and you get a ton of food wether you eat in or carry out ( I've done both many times ). Only one word of caution some of the stuff can be very spicy some days :)  So be a little adventurous and try one of the dishes above I don't think you will be disappointed.",
