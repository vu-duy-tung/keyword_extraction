My brother took us here while we were visiting him in town and the scenery was breathtaking, the service was fantastic (thanks to our awesome server Dennis) and the food was very good.  We started with the guacamole and trio of salsas and all of us were super impressed with the flavor of both appetizers and the delicious chips.  Moving on to the main course, I got a bleu cheese bacon burger, which was good - not the best I've ever had but certainly a good burger.  As for the drinks, I had two different types of margaritas and enjoyed both. This is certainly a great place to enjoy the views and hang out with friends.",

Best $30 I have ever spent! Our server was extremely nice and accommodating the entire time we were there which was from 10:30 until they closed around 1:00pm and even helped us move inside when it got too hot outside.    All of the food is insanely delicious. The man behind the counter will make you pancakes, waffles, omelets all any way you desire! The warm cheese blintzes are to die for. The fruit is super fresh and delicious too and I can not WAIT to go back when it cools off a bit and enjoy the delightful scenery surrounding the patio.",

Have had pleasant meals at Rita's before, tonight's was horrible, even with the place nearly empty. Calamari appetizer arrived within minutes of ordering, took three bites, and our main plates arrived. Okay, the cooks are bored, but with this view, I really don't want to be rushed. No one asked if we wanted another drink, and no one filled water glasses until just before the check arrived. Did I mention it was 95 degrees? Food was nothing special, could do these enchiladas at home easily. Sorry, but the magic here is gone.",

    "text": "To this day, all I can think about is their Shrimp Enchiladas. If you are going to order one thing from this restaurant, make it that. They come in a Fiestaware bowl...caked with a melt-in-your-mouth green Tomatillo sauce, topped with Sauza cheese. To make it even better, the inside has fresh shrimp, cooked just-right tortilla and topped with a fresh, crisp cabbage slaw (not mayo rich, just enough -- thinking they use sour cream instead?) So, I had this my first night and I could have eaten it for the next three nights while I was there. Heavenly.   The outdoor patio is wonderful, relaxing and even though it was chilly, there were plenty of heat lamps and I was a bit jealous of the folks that nabbed the fire pit. Live music pretty much every night (I'm not the one to judge this considering I don't venture much into guitar cover band land.) Service was a bit flake the first night, but the the second time we dined there the waitress was top notch.   I heard that local folks often eat there even if they aren't staying at the hotel and I could see why. It's a beautiful setting, relaxing and wonderful local flavors.   P.S. Breakfast is good too! Opt for the al-a-cart breakfast if you're not a big eater in the mornings, the buffet seemed a tad much and overpriced for the amount of food you could actually eat from it. But, that's the American way!",

You'll pay for it with cocktails averaging $14, but its so worth it.   My husband and I (late 20s) love coming here for a nightcap after dinner. We just sit and listen to the live music and enjoy the beautiful Arizona nights. We love walking through the property and sitting in the secluded Adirondack chairs and enjoying our drinks. It doesn't get better than this on a nice night.  We were hesitant to try - thought it would be an older, stuffy crowd but its not at all.

I've been to a good amount of the fancy resort brunch buffets, but this one has the best spread, and for the best price.   $60 per person (don't chock) get's you unlimited amount of fresh shell fish, Belgian Waffles, Pancakes and typical breakfast items, the most amazing Filet Mignon taco's, petite filets, shrimp scampi, unbelievable crab cakes, lamb chops, a huge spread of cheeses and dried fruits, and finally, an entire room dedicated to your sweet tooth! Honestly, I could keep going on, that is just a few of my favorite items! Each dish is constantly replaced- don't you hate it at the buffet when there is one scoop of hash browns left stuck to the side of the pan? Services is Marriott amazing, and I promise, if you are looking to gorge yourself and your family on a special occasion, do not overlook Camelback Inn!   PS- the patio is gorgeous and they have nice live music throughout brunch!",

The buffet, above average, and it included \"bottomless\" champagne or mimosas, which makes the $60/per person price tag hurt a little less.  There were countless options to indulge in...Outside they were offering perfect lamb chops, mini crab cakes, shrimp scampi, several fresh cooked fish options,\\ delicious quesadillas and tacos, prime rib carving station.  In side we were greeted by a glorious meat and cheese selection, lox, fruit bar, cold seafood options including seared Ahi tuna, crab claws, shrimp and cocktail sauce. A breakfast station serving up made to order pancakes, eggs benedict, and omelets, a pastry stand and a selection of breakfast meats.  Lastly, an enormous selection of desserts including bananas foster made to order.  Sounds amazing, right?  My problems with our experience at Rita's Kitchen had little to do with the food and everything to do with the service...and the birds, but I will get to that later.  The service started out great.  We placed our order, the four of us that ordered the buffet were served our mimosas and the other's were brought their coffee.  We visited the buffet and the meals from the regular menu were served.  Our beverages were topped off a couple of times and then our server seemed to disappear.  We actually had to wave him down (or someone else) if we needed anything.  This went on for the duration of our meal.  To top it all off, as plates were pre-bussed from tables, servers left them stacked at the bus station adjacent to our table. They did not clear the food so a large flock of obnoxious birds decided to feast on the remnants.  We were, literally, surrounded by birds; they dropped chunks of food on our table as the flew away, cackled so loudly that we could hardly think and to top it all of one of the birds relieved itself as it flew over us.  The load narrowly missed my friend, but ended up landing on the jacket hanging on the back of her chair.  Disgusting!  We were offered an extra cloth napkin to help clean up the mess, but not so much as an apology from the server or a manager.    Great food, questionable service, repulsive birds...",

    "text": "I ate here twice while on a staycation (the resort itself is awesome...but that's another post)  The first night we went for dinner. First off I love the atmosphere. Live music on the patio that was full, but our seats inside were right by the doors that they completely open up to the patio so it's like being there  anyway. Great for the 2 months a year that it isn't scorching hot here in Az   We got chips, salsa, and guac. The guac was good but I'm not a fan of their salsa at all. We ended up asking for pico that was at least better but still not great  For my entree I got the chopped salad and added on steak. When it arrived I was shocked at how small it was for an entree salad. Didn't really have much flavor either. It was disappointing. The people I was with didn't seem to love their food either. While not as bad as mine, it was just \"ok\". And the price is high for it coming with any kind of sides. Their saving grace for the night though was that I got their churros for dessert (I was still hungry after that teeny tiny salad). Very fresh and had a great texture. Soft and slightly chewy...not too hard. But even with the good dessert overall it was underwhelming to say the least. I don't go to restaurants just for good desserts. I expect a good dinner   We asked about brunch the next day and the hostess almost downplayed it...saying it was \"only\" their summer brunch so it doesn't have as many options. We showed up anyway and I'm sooo glad that we did!! If that was their scaled down brunch the winter brunch must be insane!  Lots of great options. Your typical breakfast foods...potatoes, French toast, breakfast meats fruit etc. Then empanadas, prime rib, shrimp, guacamole, antipasto platters, enchiladas...all kinds of good stuff! All of it was tasty too. Nothing \"eh\" like dinner the night before. They are very generous with the bottomless mimosas as well and are quick to refill your glass. You can also actually taste the champagne...they don't skimp!! They do it just how I like...champagne with a splash of orange juice lol.   Overall...skip the restaurant for dinner. Not sure about lunch. I'm really glad I didn't let our dinner experience hold us back from going to brunch. Had I just gone for dinner my score would be a 2 or 3. But with the delicious brunch I'll raise it to a solid 4",

For dinner, service was slow (more than 15 minutes for a second glass of wine, multiple reminders for chips, etc.) and $18 vegetable tacos (two) were basically pico de gallo and squash in two flimsy corn tortillas. Promised ranchero beans became half a cob of corn. The following morning, we hoped for a Bloody Mary at R bar. It was as though they'd never heard of such a thing. Ultimately, we walked -- after the bartender went back and forth from the bar to a back room to \"look for the Bloody Mary mix.\" Ultimately, a lame experience.",

I particularly liked the smoked salmon, pain au chocolat, omelette station, and their coffee. Price was very reasonable for the buffet and not too crowded even on a Saturday morning.",

There's also an enormous patio area out back with live music some evenings and a water feature like a small moat. Happy hour gets very popular, with $5 wine and draft beers, some $6 cocktails (made with some real liquors, not house crap). One of the $5 wines is a very good Albarino, which qualifies as an exceptional bargain in my book. They also have some reduced-price appetizers at happy hour, including a generous $3 chips-and-salsa with a sampler of four different salsas (all very good.)  They also serve lunch in here, and they have amazing fish tacos.   I've stayed at the resort twice and made copious use of this place both times. I've never run across a staff member who was anything less than exceptionally pleasant and efficient.",

This place can be whatever you want, anything from a romantic night out to Friday night festivities with the gang/coworkers. The live music has always been a solo act acoustic guitar+vocals, so don't be scared away by the \"live music\", it is very relaxed. They have outdoor and indoor areas so they are good year round. Amazing scenery, landscaping and overall feel. Good value on food and drink, all around deserving of a 5'er. Check it out!!",

Google Maps took us on a bit of a drive through a neighborhood of million-dollar homes which was nice. The entire resort is decorated for Christmas which made it lovely.  The food was outstanding. I don't believe I've ever had enchiladas in salsa verde that were as goid; it was quite sublime. The subtle hint of lime under the tomatillos on the enchiladas camarones con salsa verde was absolutely outstanding. For dessert we shared the chocolate torte with mini vanilla milkshake. The cake is almost two desserts in one with chocolate mousse on the top and layer cake below. We had great service from Wendy.",

    "text": "Rita's Kitchen is a hidden gem located right smack in the center of the Camelback Inn. While this may be a hot-spot for hotel guests, I think that locals might be missing out on its charm.   I am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Rita's Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night.   Breakfast:   Breakfast at Rita's is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. It's a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast. Just today was Mother's Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet, I did catch a glimpse of the Mother's Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd! Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain.   Lunch:  Lunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind. If the weather permits, sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful water fountains, views of the mountain and tropical/desert setting.",

For our menu we chose the Build Your Own Trio lunch, which included everything: salad, soup, sandwich, dessert & drinks.  The wait staff took care of everything, helped set up & take down our decorations, even held off a little on timing when some guests were late.  The AV department set up all needed equipment for our slide show.  Event staff helped with planning & met with us ahead of time so everything would be sure to go smoothly.  I would highly recommend Rita's Kitchen & the Camelback Inn when you have a special event!

Unfortunately, the food I tried didn't deliver as well as I would've liked. The chips and guacamole tasted bland and uninteresting and the sweet potato tots were tasty but I felt there should've been different sauce options. I must admit the redeeming factor was probably the Desert Pear Cosmo- this drink was absolutely delicious! Not too sweet and with a niche flavor I loved to find in the desert. I'll give this place another shot but ultimately felt the food/drink execution was hit or miss.  Last but not least the guitar player on 3/23 was so talented!

As someone allergic cats I was immediately turned off.  Ok, let's break down this visit.  Waitress was very nice, a little \"green,\" but a complete sweetheart who seemed to try her best.  My warm water was never delivered, my daughter's drink was never refilled & she never offered condiments with my daughter's leftovers.  I feel bad for critiquing her because she was so nice but she has more to learn.  On a good note, they prebussed well.  I ordered a chips & salsa tree.  Three out of the four were good but the guacamole/tomatillo salsa was missing something.  I thought there green salsa tasted store bought.  The chips weren't too salty & were nice & crispy.  At this point, I'm pretty excited to try my shrimp & carne asada.  I'm thinking it's going to be amazing & I'll finally get to try elote.  (I was definitely curious about my husband's shrimp verdes enchiladas)  Food comes & that's about the best thing I can say about it.  I looked at my corn & it was clearly drying out from sitting around a while.  There was a weird stabbed key lime on the plate as well, also dry.  The shrimp, all three of them were eh but cooked appropriately (all 3 of them).  The beans were pretty good but nothing that really stood out to me.  Ok the best letdown was the carne asada.  It was a thick slab of meat not thinner slices, which is more traditional.  I ordered it medium rare & it was delivered slightly overcooked.  I was pleased with the tenderness of the meat but the flavor just tasted burned.  I called it charburned instead of charbroiled.  I asked for tortillas for my carne & she brought me three dried out tortillas that sat wrapped up so long they broke apart as i unrolled them.  I asked for more & they weren't much better.  I tasted one bite of my husband's enchiladas & was disappointed to taste that it was covered with that horrible store bought tasting green salsa.  I did not return for another bite.  I had high hopes for this place.  :/  P.S. my tourist friends loved it.  Perhaps they just didn't know better.",

    "text": "How embarrassing!  Last night, I suggested Rita's for a graduation dinner because  their happy hour was so good the last time I visited.  Big mistake. 2 plates of calamari that were barely cooked. I ordered the shrimp tacos special and there was nothing special about shells that fell apart, barely any shrimp and zero flavor. Two others in our group ordered the fish tacos and it was the same. BLAH!!  Another ordered the chicken tacos and again, no excitement there. So we thought the graduation girl would have better luck with her Filet Mignon. She did!  Unfortunately the asparagus tanked in texture and freshness.  The best part of our meal was the bread and butter that they served, which we thought how odd when the majority of the menu is southwestern. Chips and salsa might have been s better option.   The guys ordered beers which were on the cool but not cold side.  Refills on water only came at the end of our meal    This reinforces one of our friends opinion that resort restaurant fare doesn't fair well at all.  At least the views were nice.",

    "text": "Supremely underwhelming IMO.  Boyfriend and I came here on New Year's Day for their brunch buffet.  We didn't want to be useless for the rest of the day so we opted out of the full buffet and just stuck to the breakfast items.  The eggs and pancakes to order was pretty nice, but that's the extent of it.  Everything else is pretty much what you would expect from a hotel continental breakfast.  Nothing spectacular and definitely not worth $25 per person.  I'm assuming the full buffet is much better, since I saw everything from a raw bar to prime rib being served.  However, it still doesn't really seem worth the money to be served food from under a heat lamp.   If you're a buffet person, this definitely seems like a good one.  But if you're on the fence, just sit this one out and order off the menu.",

We had a great window seat the overlooked the outdoor terrace and the mountains in the background was lovely!    The hostess was very friends and our waiter was attentive and fairly personable.    I ordered the Beet & Goat Cheese salad with Grilled Chicken and it was quite good!  Even though I liked it very much, I would only give it a 3 out of 5 because they didn't use Roasted Beets...I believe that they were canned beets.   Still good, but roasted beets would have knocked it out of the park!  The salad had spinach, mild goat cheese, mandarin oranges, red onion, and delicious candied pecans....with a balsamic vinaigrette.  It was a very good salad.  I wished I had ordered the small serving though because it was a large salad!  The   My Husband ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with fries.  The fries were SO good!  The sandwich was equally good, but spicy from the roasted pablano that was on it.  Net-net....it was a very good lunch, but I can only give it 3 stars because it cost us $40 for a salad, a sandwich, a soda (I had water),and gratuity.  For $40.00 for lunch, it should have been outstanding, not just very good.  I get that it's in a resort, but still.",

I ordered my lunch and a water with lemon.  The waitress was great about refilling my water and \"making sure that I would stay hydrated\".  It was really wonderful, and made me feel taken care of - kind of like a kid, but not in a childish way.  In a \"I just care\" kind of way.  She even prepared me a plastic to go cup of water with a lemon in it, and I refilled it all day long.  I've actually been here twice (once for dinner and once for lunch). Everything is delicious.  Perfectly cooked, thoughtful, and fresh.  The margaritas are fantastic, and the guacamole is delicious.  I highly recommend coming here, even if you are not staying at the Camelback.",

Usually, this is a problem because I've found that most hotel restaurants have boring fare and terrible service.  This was NOT the case this week in Scottsdale.  Let's start with the service: EXCELLENT.  Mimi or Ronda were our servers every time we dined at Rita's.  They were friendly, knowledgeable, attentive and served our food HOT.  We were always offered sodas or water \"to go\" after our meal - the ladies knew we were headed off to yet another meeting.  Thank you both! Ronda - I hope you enjoyed the chocolate we shared with you and hope we've converted another fan to the world of TCHO chocolate!  :-)  The food: Chicken tortilla soup was so good, I had some with every day.  The chicken enchiladas rojos were A-MAZ-ING, as were the Marriott burger and brunch offerings.   You SHOULD expect flies, mosquitoes, annoying birds, etc. when you are dining outside, so the complaints about that are ridiculous.  Dine inside if you can't handle the joys of nature...Rita's has indoor and outdoor seating.  The live music was fantastic - truly talented artists.",

Happy hour also offers several $6 cocktails - the one with prickly pear and pear vodka is divine - and glasses of wine for $5. The bar staff knows how to mix up anything you can conjure up (I've tested them) and are friendly and attentive.   The lounge is happening several nights a week with live music and in the quiet nook that is Pardise Valley finding a live active bar scene can be a gift.",

    "text": "We were recently in Scottsdale to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday which happened to fall on Sunday, the 16th. We were with another couple who always said this was the best Sunday brunch in America, (better than the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs and others). We were excited about the birthday as well as the highly recommended brunch.  Unfortunately, upon arrival, things went bad and never improved. We were seated at an outdoor table with a good view (one of the few positives), however, a circular pool of vomit was adjacent to one of our chairs. We had to ask for someone to come and clean it up. Instead of \"I'm terribly sorry, let me seat you at another table,\" we just had to stand around the area and wait almost 10 minutes for the clean up to be completed.  During the delay, I decided to explore the buffet and what was being offered to make it so expensive. I started at the first area (inside) and was greeted by the stifling smell of rotten fish. Perhaps, that was what made the last person so sick. Moving quickly past to the row of food items arranged outside (where the air was fresh), I asked to see the lamb chops and beef tenderloin, both of which were cooked beyond \"well done.\" Even the prime rib was overcooked and dry. The cooked meats appeared just right for my in-laws from Oklahoma, but out of the question for anyone who typically orders medium-rare. French toast and other egg items appeared to have been pre-cooked, certainly not to order. The only edible item was the fresh tacos being made to order by an old Mexican woman.  I returned to our table after the vomit was cleaned up, decided not to order the buffet and asked the waiter for a menu. My wife and the other couple opted for the buffet (against my recommendation). I waited at least 10 more minutes for the menu to come and the waiter disappeared again. Finally, I ordered a simple bacon cheeseburger and fries for which, again, I had to wait almost 25 minutes. I guess I was being punished for not ordering the overpriced, overcooked buffet!  After we were through and left, I asked my wife how the tacos were (the ONLY thing she got from the buffet that she could eat). She said \"fine, but hardly worth the price.\" I'm glad the other couple picked up the check as this was simply HORRIBLE food and a big disappointment! Do yourself a favor and skip the Sunday brunch at Rita's Cafe - no matter what people tell you.",

They come in a Fiestaware bowl...caked with a melt-in-your-mouth green Tomatillo sauce, topped with Sauza cheese. To make it even better, the inside has fresh shrimp, cooked just-right tortilla and topped with a fresh, crisp cabbage slaw (not mayo rich, just enough -- thinking they use sour cream instead?) So, I had this my first night and I could have eaten it for the next three nights while I was there. Heavenly.  The outdoor patio is wonderful, relaxing and even though it was chilly, there were plenty of heat lamps and I was a bit jealous of the folks that nabbed the fire pit. Live music pretty much every night (I'm not the one to judge this considering I don't venture much into guitar cover band land.) Service was a bit flake the first night, but the the second time we dined there the waitress was top notch.   I heard that local folks often eat there even if they aren't staying at the hotel and I could see why. It's a beautiful setting, relaxing and wonderful local flavors.  P.S. Breakfast is good too! Opt for the al-a-cart breakfast if you're not a big eater in the mornings, the buffet seemed a tad much and overpriced for the amount of food you could actually eat from it. But, that's the American way!",

Rita's Kitchen was one of the best buffets I've ever experienced. Everything I tried was very fresh and high quality even at 1:45 in the afternoon. Never thought I'd say it, but the blackberries on the fruit bar were the highlight of my meal. Also had brie, manchego, salami, lox, grilled vegetables, prime rib, crab claws, shrimp cocktail and scampi, skirt steak, salad, and lots of champagne. Service was great, view of the mountains and location on the patio was fantastic.   This was a memorable experience. I would strongly recommend Rita's to a friend and will return myself.",

There were salads galore, marinated mushrooms, etc.etc.  I could go on and on but there's just too much to list.  The desserts were so good, especially the Bananas Foster.

It's a treat but you certainly leave feeling like you got your money's worth, or close to it, because it's hard to eat that much food as it is a bit on the pricey side.    Anyways, this is the brunch to attend and I will also mention that my vegetarian friends would find plenty to eat as well.  The service was second to none.  Great experience all around!",

They are my favorite margs in town. They are expensive but I love the fresh lime juice. I had the special which was grouper fish with asparagus and mashed potatoes. It was very flavorful and nicely prepared. My friend ordered seafood tacos.",

    "text": "After hearing good things about the Camelback Inn, I was excited to check it out.  We will not be returning after the very poor service that is unacceptable for a high-end resort.  My advice is to skip Camelback Inn entirely and head to the Sanctuary.  My husband and I came during HH.  We sat down on a couch and almost immediately, someone came over and brought us water, telling us that our server will be with us shortly.  Turns out, that would be the best service we would receive for the rest of our visit.    We waited approximately 10 minutes while being politely ignored by the server helping the customers arounds us.  Finally, just as we were about ready to leave, another server shows up and asks us for our drink order.  She explained that she just now arrived to work.  We decided to stay and proceeded to tell her what we would like.  We told her our drink order and were about to tell her our food order, but she cut us off and asked whether we were hotel guests or not.  When we said we were not, she abrasively asked us for a credit card.  It was very off-putting.  When she came back, she did ask us if we wanted any food, but we frankly were so disappointed with the whole ordeal we just wanted to have our drinks and leave.    After our drinks, we asked for our check.  Before we could even put the signed credit card slip back into the folder, the server comes swooping over to take it.  She might as well said \"Don't let the door hit you on the way out.\"",

The venue was really beautiful with a relatively small indoor area with some TVs, but the outside was massive and really just beautiful at night. Fire pits were blazing and the live music really set a romantic and relaxing mood. (Extra points for that).   In my experiences the wait staff were hit or miss. When it was just drinks, everything came out pretty quickly, but every time we seemed to order bar food while drinking it was a little delayed. The food, however, was really yummy.   Will definitely continue to hang there when visiting the resort again. Not sure I'd make a special trip if I were staying el",

The wine and cocktails were good quality, and the apps were awfully good - even the tortilla chips that came with our dip were freshly made and better than what you usually get at the mexican restaurants.

With that being said the food is pretty good and the drinks are surprisingly not as over priced.   We stayed at the resort for a night, which is an awesome place-highly recommend, and came here for lunch and drinks. We had the carne asada tacos and the chicken quesadilla. Super tasty- not a huge quesadilla but had plenty of chicken inside and the tacos delicious. The margaritas were also great.   We came back for happy hour that night, the servers were attentive and very friendly. Great happy hour! Drinks were 5-7$ and they have a cheaper food menu. We even stopped by later that night. They have live music until 10 but we missed that action. We sat out on the back patio which was had a cute and peaceful atmosphere but it was not as crowded as it had been around happy hour.   I'm not sure if I would come back to this place only because it's a little out of the way and super pricy, but if i was in the area and it was during happy hour I would definitely stop by!!",

We then waited for our appetizers (chips and salsa) for almost as long as our meals took, they came out only minutes apart. The meals were awful, dry and bland (fajitas and green chili pork). All to follow with being over charged and argued with when I pointed out the mistake to the server. The place is so nice and beautiful and the ambiance is one of a kind, but for the price your paying it was sad to say that was our first and probably last time. To conclude this entire experience my husband and I ended up getting extremely sick later that night from the food we ate. Hopefully people have better experiences and are able to highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "When I was pondering where to go for a breakfast meeting a few weeks ago, my husband suggested choosing from one of the many local resort restaurants...   It was a great idea, and I'm not sure why I didn't think of it on my own.  I took it and ran with it and headed to Rita's with Lindsey D.  Rita's was awesome for breakfast that day... we both found great parking spots and walked right in.  There was not a wait and the weather was perfect for us to dine alfresco.  Service was top notch and food was fabulous too!  And the best thing? They didn't seem to mind that we stayed after our meal to take advantage of their free wifi to work for a bit!    So why only three stars, you might be wondering?    Well, I had such a wonderful breakfast that day, that I ended up suggesting Rita's for a group dinner the following week, and I've since been back two more times; once for lunch and another time for dinner with my husband.  After those three additional visits, I can say that I still recommend Rita's for the following:  *breakfast *drinks alfresco with a fabulous view *chips and tableside prepared guacamole *lunch if you don't mind paying a premium for the setting *a kid friendly environment *live music in the evenings 7 days a week  I find that while breakfast at Rita's is reasonably priced, lunch and dinner can get pricey and the food is really nothing to write home about.  I had a salad for lunch, a fish entree for one dinner, and the chicken tortilla soup at the other dinner.  I also sampled my husband's chicken wings and chicken entree.  If you go for lunch or dinner, Rita's Chopped Salad is tasty, but the entree portion is small... so is the starter portion, but I expected that from a starter.  I do not recommend the chicken tortilla soup, chicken wings, halibut, or chicken entree.  I'd probably go for a burger or tacos if I end up at Rita's for dinner in the future.  If you care less about food quality and more about convenience, ambiance, the ability to reserve a table for a group, and/or a place that is kid-friendly... don't hesitate to head to Rita's.  I am indeed a fan of this local resort gem for the entire experience (save for some of the aforementioned menu items).  I'm sure I'll head back (likely for breakfast), but won't be rushing to Rita's for lunch or dinner anytime too soon.",

    "text": "I emailed the restaurant manager 8 days ago with no response. I am truly disappointed. See email below.  Hi Pauline,  I recently dined at Rita's Kitchen on Sunday November 5th and the reservation was under Dee Wheeler at 11am. My aunt dines there frequently and I have been there about 5 times. It was her 60th birthday so I wanted to make it special and take her to one of her favorite places for champagne brunch. She loves sitting by the window, beautiful atmosphere, the staff and of course the food! I called earlier in the week to see if I could purchase flowers and have them set on the table prior to us arriving. I was told you guys didn't offer that service which was fine so I asked if I could bring in flowers a day prior and they be waiting on the table upon arrival. I dropped off the flowers Saturday afternoon and gave them to the hostess and she put them in the refrigerator and also put notes in open table to have them on the table for the reservation. We arrived on Sunday and no flowers on the table. I go back to the hostess stand and I asked the girl who had on a floral shirt and dark hair (the same girl I gave the flowers to on Saturday) where the flowers were and she said \"oh i was just about to bring them out\". My instructions were that I wanted them on the table prior to arrival so when she walked up she could see them and be surprised. I could've just brought them myself on Sunday if that was the case. I was really upset because I felt like she ruined the surprise and all I wanted was to make the day special, I was very upset and i felt like she didn't care, or apologize about it. She just brushed it off. Having been a hostess at Ruth's Chris and City hall I know the importance of accommodating special request and i feel like she didn't follow through when it was full proof and easy. Also I want to mention that the service wasn't great either, a couple of times we had to go fill our own champagne because the servers were never around. The two tables next to us we're doing the same thing. As a fine dining restaurant at a 4.5 star resort i would expect more. This was the first time we received that type of service, I didn't want to say anything that day because I didn't want to put a damper on the day. I think you should speak with your staff and let them know they drop the ball on that day. I have such a bad taste in my mouth that I really do not want to return but I know my aunt will. I just wanted to offer some feedback.  Kindest Regards,  Michelle  Sent from my iPhone",

    "text": "My first negative review and hopefully my last.  We made a reservation through Open Table based on the reviews and because all of the other restaurants in town were booked solid.    We arrived at Rita's Kitchen and there about 4 tables occupied (which was the first indication that this was not going to be good) on a very quiet Friday night.  We were seated at a broken lopsided table inside stuffed against a corner and then we never saw anyone ever again to take our drink order.  We waited for about 15 mins and couldn't catch any waitresses attention as they walked by.  Never once did anyone acknowledge us or have any concern that there were customers not being take care of.  We gave up on trying to flag down a waitress and decided to leave and go elsewhere.  We attempted to make another reservation elsewhere through open table but the hostess had not checked out our reservation.  We called the restaurant and was put on hold for 10 minutes.  We hung up and called back and asked to speak to a manager and was put on hold for a good while again.  Manager was cordial and apologetic.  They couldn't figure out why the reservation was not clearing.    My advice, pick another restaurant in the Valley.  Any other one.  This one is not a good value for the prices I saw on the menus, nor the service.",

So disappointing. The Chicken Enchiladas looked good and my friend said they were. The Fish Special came out raw. Pink, translucent Raw! They replaced it with the tiniest portion of Sea Bass. I'm actually embarrassed for the Chef. Tiny portions for $25-$30? Come on!!! They have beautiful ambiance, good service, nice live entertainment but where's the Beef? (Old commercial) I'm here on Business for 3 more days and I definitely have some weight to lose but after reading other reviews, I'm not the only one that is disappointed in this Restaurant.

Upon driving up to the absolutely gorgeous Camelback Inn (not on Camelback Rd), I valet'ed the ride and walked in, and was seated right away. Had a great table by the fountain, and was luckily shaded by the umbrella from the ever-increasing AZ sunshine. The menu is not expansive, but I was able to decide on something I was looking forward to; the club sandwich 1/2 with small Caesar and Tortilla Soup. I got a lemonade to drink, and the lemonade ranks second only to the fantastic lemonade at The Orange Table. I really liked the presentation of the meal, with the three items served on the same rectangular plate. The service was excellent, and I couldn't help but be in a great mood. Kind of like when you are in a shitty mood and \"Brown-Eyed Girl\" by Van Morrison comes on the radio. As I walked back to the car and admired the beautiful view and landscaping of the Camelback Inn, I noted to myself that this would be a great place to take my Mom the next time she is in town. I started this review giving it four stars, but after writing this, I'm changing it to a fiver.",

I ordered the chicken enchiladas since the waitress said it was the best enchiladas in AZ.  Big statement, so I had to check her accuracy and honestly they were incredible.  If not the best I ever had, in the top 5.  My girl got the green pork dish and she loved it.  I had a bite and agreed it would have been another good choice.  Great time and food and had an after dinner drink sitting around the fire pit and listening to the music.  Highly recommended and will go again!",

As beautiful as the view is, I quickly realized this was a mistake due to how hot it was.  Also, I felt like the service takes a lot longer to get to you outside.  So, I sat in the R bar, which is right across from Rita's, where the menu is also available.  To start, I ordered the chicken tortilla soup, fresh ingredients such as tomatoes, avocados, and cilantro.  The broth was very good as well.  I ordered the house carne asada tacos for $18.  The dish was good it came with two tacos, some rice and fresh beans.  The meat was very tender, the salsa was good and the beans were great, but, I just did not feel the portion was worth $18, but, I am sure part of this was due to being in a resort.    For dinner, I ordered the queso fundido.  It was ok, I was disappointed by the lack of chorizo and the feta they added.  Most fundido's, I have had do not have Feta it took away from the dish.  I ordered the chicken poblano sandwich for $16, again good just did not feel it was worth the price.",

I like the fire pits and there are a bunch of tables and chairs.  The menu is slightly upscale hotel food.  The problem is with the service.  It took 1/2 hour for my friend to get her Arnold Palmer after the rest of our drinks arrived.  We asked for the burgers to be cut in half so they could be shared and they weren't.  The chicken quesadilla we asked to be cut into six pieces, one for each person in our group, came in the standard cut of four pieces.  Hello, doesn't Marriott care enough to make Bill M's favorite resort a service standout?",

Shrimp Enchiladas Verdes ($25) Fresh tasting ingredients topped with melted cheese, and immersed in a green sauce that has a bit of heat.  [Something] Cookies ($9) It's pretty much three mini brownies with ice cream. Take a moment to let the cookies cool down if you don't want instant regret. Regardless, the hot insides of the chocolate balance with the cold ice cream. Also, because of how rich the cookies are, this dish is probably best to share with two other people.   tl;dr: Relaxing atmosphere; high quality food.",

    "text": "I'm honestly truly bummed that this was my first time at the R bar! How have I never heard of or been to this place before?!  For starters, this place is GORGEOUS.  I mean obviously it's gorgeous - it's tucked away in the Camelback Inn resort FYI.  This place is surrounded with just a ridiculous number of gorgeous views.  Mountains, lights, a small chapel...  The architecture here is phenomenal! And don't even get me started on how beautiful the sunset looks here! Just wow.  And that's all right outside of the R bar. I wish I had more time to explore the entire resort... Oh well, I guess I'll just have to come back.  I can definitely see why this place is a celebrity hot spot.  I don't know the exact details, but this place certainly has a lot of history behind it. I believe this resort was partially built/invested by a man named John Lincoln who is originally from Cleveland, Ohio.  He and his wife moved to AZ because his wife suffered from TB and he believed that the dry climate would be better for her.   Anyway, back to the R bar.  This place offers a ton of comfortable seating.  The ambiance is very warm and relaxed.  There's a ton of space indoors, but the outside patio is HUGE! The entire patio is covered in additional chairs and tables, all of which are surrounded by water misters, ANDDDD the coolest part? There's live music in the evening!  The patio definitely had more of a romantic feel to it.   I sat at the indoor bar and was very pleased with the service.  I came here for happy hour and one particular bartender (I'm pretty sure he's one of the favorites!), Joe, was absolutely amazing.  He was so friendly and welcoming.  And boy, he sure knows how to make a good drink.  I didn't order his \"signature margarita,\" but everyone around me did.  Multiple times.  Actually, I met quite a few people who said \"I don't order this margarita unless Joe makes it.\"  What a guy!   I ordered the camelback mule which was delicious! I was afraid it was going to taste too sweet or have a strong vodka taste, but Joe definitely knows what he's doing! I also had the salsa and guac as well as the habanero wings.  The chips, salsa and guac were all good, but the wings were GREAT.  Although they weren't even a tiny bit spicy, they had a ton of flavor packed into them.  Actually, to be honest, I kind of wish I opted out of the chips and salsa and placed another order for the wings instead... Oh well, next time!  Long story short, this is definitely a place to check out.  Whether you're just grabbing a drink or snack with some friends, a loved one, or celebrating a special occasion, this is a great place to go.  I'll be sure to update my review the next time I stop by.  I'm going to try and squeeze in a resort day before I leave AZ!  P.S.  FYI no outside food is allowed.  If you want to bring a birthday cake, don't.  They charge you $5/slice cutting fee...",

Haven't been here for a few years but it holds special sentimental value since its one of the first places I went with my (now) husband. There was great live music that played until 10. We were invited to make s'mores out front. I ate shrimp toast (5), quac and chips (5) and a small beet and goat cheese salad (2). The goat cheese salad was bombarded with raw red onions. At least a quarter of an onion... salad bowl was small and difficult to eat out of. My friends enjoyed cocktails and pork green chili and seemed happy. Service was slow, not a place to go if you're in a hurry. Left feeling relaxed and replenished.",

One of the places I've been to but seem to forget to review... but I got pictures this time! Came here on a Friday night with my boyfriend and his family. We started with the shrimp ceviche while we waited for everyone else to arrive. To be quite honest, it was just okay. It was much more watery than we expected and seemed to only have a few shrimps that were cut into it.   I got the Rita Rita margarita and it definitely went down easy. I think I had 3 of them! When everyone arrived, we got an order of the queso and it was so friggin good! Everyone enjoyed it. We also got the guacamole and salsa but it couldn't top the queso.   For my main meal, I got the sea bass while everyone else ordered the enchiladas. I think my boyfriend was the only one that ordered the green chile pork one though. I'm always the one in our dinner party to order fish. I thought it was put together nicely but I would like to try something else next time. I always enjoy Chilean sea bass but it just didn't stand out to me. Maybe it was because I had too many margaritas at this point.   For dessert, we decided on the churros. Perfectly for sharing and it comes with a spicy chocolate dipping sauce! Unexpected (because we didn't read the description) but a good surprise.  We've always enjoyed our meals here - looking forward to the next visit.",

We stopped in on a Friday night and surprisingly it wasn't too busy and we were seated immediately on the patio. They had live music going which set a nice tone for dinner. It was a solo artist with a guitar so it wasn't too loud where you couldn't hear your company's conversations.   We started with the queso which was to die for! It was enough for all four of us and everyone just loved it. We also had a pitcher (or two) of the Rita Rita which was nice and fresh tasting. It wasn't too sweet like most house margaritas tend to be. My husband and I both got the enchiladas and they were perfectly done. It came with 2 enchiladas but there were no sides that come along with it so you will have to order separate if you desire. 2 was more than enough though, as they were large and I couldn't even finish them.   This place has a wonderful setting and I highly recommend stopping in. The only downside was that the menu was a bit small.",

    "text": "I took my lady out for Christmas dinner last year (2017) at Rita's Kitchen, and that's all she was expecting. A nice dinner at a spanking nice resort. My plan was to take her to CitySkate in downtown Phoenix after dinner, and propose to her with the Christmas scenery behind us. After dinner we walked the grounds of the restaurant. My plan quickly changed the moment that she mentioned how beautiful the scenery was, and how it would be a nice engagement location. We walked a little further until we got to a well lit area by a small \"bridge\" with a little waterfall/creek... and BOOM... there I was proposing to the love of my life. She was in complete shock and tears.   Expect the unexpected, anything can happen at Rita's Kitchen!",

The food was delicious, once we got it. The restuarant had no more than 20 patrons that night and it took almost 45 minutes for our entrees to be delivered. It was odd because our appetizers were delivered tableside in what seemed like seconds. All in all the place is a wonderful place to eat and take in the history, ambience and southwest charm. I would like ot think that the slow service that night was just representative of a \"bad day\" and not business as usual.",

Even of of my friends ordered French Toast (which had cornflakes and almonds).  The dining room is somewhat southwestern contemporary...almost too much for a restaurant with a name like Rita's Kitchen. It is somewhat too early to tell how this restaurant will do  at such an early stage. Nonetheless, the tasty food and gracious service are essential in predicting future success.",

I am stunned speechless at how awful the attitudes and behavior of the employees was. The first day of my stay I approached the hostess stand to be seated.  Apparently I was interrupting a personal conversation; the hostess turned her back to me to continue, uninterrupted.  . The servers uniform was dirty and ill-fitting.  There were finger prints all over my plate.  The dirty plates were never removed from my table, even when I pushed them aside. I asked three people to please find my server for my check.  15 min later she gave me my check and walked away and left all the dirty utensils, plates and napkins.  I paid my bill and left the customary 20% gratuity.  This is one of the few times I regret that. The next evening I saw a manager.  I decided not to waste my time. It was obvious at that point why the staff was unkempt and unprofessional, it starts with management.",

You needed a steak knife to cut the over done sausages (Denny's has better pancakes and sausages at 1/8 the price). We got a great view with our table facing the door into the hotel, not the beautiful grounds (I guess they try and jam more tables in for the brunch). The breakfast buffet at the Westin Kierland is 100 times better than Rita's, with fresher food and a much better selection. The front staff was totally apathetic and showed very poor customer service training. They blamed me, not Open Table, for booking breakfast (even though I explained I clicked on the brunch category and link).",

I am not very fond of outdoor seating but it worked out perfectly here, with the nice weather, mellow live music in the background, lights and ambiance over all. Our server took excellent care of us and the good was really good. I had the filet and it was cooked to my satisfaction. We had chips and guacamole, and to my surprise the salsas were very good. For dessert we had the churros and key lime pie. The churros were good, but the key lime pie was a little too sour and lemony. I know it is to be expected, but it was just too much. Everything else was great, though. Overall a very good experience.",

The beautiful outdoor patio, strong drinks and table side guacamole. Offer me that any day of the week and you've got a very happy customer. Even on a hot afternoon, there's misters to keep guests relatively cool while enjoying some tequila or a chilled glass of vino. Guacamole and salsa trio? Heck yes!  Entrees can be hit or miss -- my fish tacos were pretty dry and bland. But when covered in the aforesaid salsa and or guacamole, they were fine. Dessert is quite good, I recommend the home made churros with Mexican chocolate dipping sauce.   You're at the JW, so it's not going to be cheap. However, it's so lovely to kick back with a cocktail and enjoy the ambiance. Well worth it!",

I definitely would not order either of these items again. The chicken enchiladas were OK but for $21 you would think you should get some rice and beans as a side you get to enchiladas for the order.",

Perhaps I should first start with the beautiful atmosphere Rita's offers both inside and out. From the mission style southwestern architecture of the building to the cozy but massive backyard patio with live music, this is the kind of place you can easily pass a few hours.   We ordered the tables-side guacamole which was an entertaining and delicious addition to the overall experience. To round out our appetizer offerings, we also ordered the chips with the four salsa combination which was delightful.   Overall, this was a very fun and tasty experience that I would recommend.",

The bottomless mimosas were a big hit at our table.   All of the different food stations gave us more variety than we knew what to do with.  The seafood station was a great start and the prime rib were some of the best items we had!  This is a must if you are a local and want a lovely Sunday buffet.

I had their HH moscow mule.    Not bad.   Had a sort of spicy kick to it, which helped make it not so sweet.  We shared the hh Chicken Quesadilla and the nonHH calamari.    The dip for the quesadilla was perfect with the right flavoring for the chicken and just enough cheese..    In fact, we liked the dip so much we asked for extra and even used it for the calamari.    They have music on the patio, which starts at 6:00.   We moved out there about 6:30.   By that time, the sun had gone down, and it was comfortable.   Looking at the mountains, we listened to Dominick on the patio.   So lovely and peaceful.   He performs there every Thursday.

For the all included buffet breakfast, they had an array of desserts, fruits, eggs, and cereals for a total of $27 before taxes and tip. I had huevos rancheros, fruits, desserts, and coffee. For lunch, they have mostly Mexican food. We sat at the bar and had tacos, quesadillas, and guacamole and chips. It was delicious. The bill was $60 before taxes and tip. Good place if you want to eat on site as this restaurant is located inside the JW Marriot Camelbak Hotel.",

Next time I have to work in Phoenix I will try my best to stay at this hotel so I can eat like a king and not leave the hotel.  Lastly, the service was great and so were the bartenders.",

    "text": "Ok ok ok, I am subscribed to the Yelp PHX newsletter even though I moved to Chicago a couple years ago, but they had an article on \"marvelous margaritas\" and I looked at it expecting to see Rita's on there. To my dismay, it was not listed.   I know margaritas aren't a rarity in the valley, but you absolutely must come to Rita's and get their house marg. It's super strong but perfectly balanced, so it won't taste like you're being waterboarded with tequila. And if you come during their happy hour (3-6), it's only $8. Yes, there are cheaper margaritas, but there are none at this level that cost less than $15, I promise.  Things that are also amazing at Rita's:   -queso fundido - a must! some of the best I've had -chips and guac -filet sliders -THE FREE DAILY MUSIC!!! I've seen some seriously great artists playing and singing while I sip my cocktails, and there's a beautiful backdrop of a small mountain right there.  Yes, Rita's is a little off the beaten path, but that's exactly the point. Go grab an amazing drink, have some delicious bites, and soak in the beauty of the valley while you're soothed by the sounds of live music!",

We asked if we could sit outside and the guy snidely asks \"Well did you request to sit outside on the reservation?\" My husband responded with \"No... there was no option to do that.\" Guy rudely responds with \"well.. normally people request to be seated outside when making a reservation. And all of those tables are reserved for people who requested it.\" He started walking away... turns around and says \"I'll seat you now.\" Mind you, he grabbed four menus ( my son is 4 years old and looks like it... no possible way you could mistake him for being able to read a menu), I asked him if we could have the kids menu with crayons... he stopped and freaking rolling his eyes right at me! I should have turned around and walked right out. Not a good first impression, I didn't want to spoil the morning so I went along with it. Oh and he sat us as far away from outside as possible, bypassing all of the tables near the patio, we were the third group in the restaurant... only two other tables were taken. Our waitress was really nice and attentive... kudos to her! The breakfast buffet was phenomenal, I would totally go back... except if I see that guy again I'd probably punch him in the throat.  I guess someone told him that my husband is a supervisor for Marriott because the guy came back a little while later to kiss some ass, asking how our meal was... we just ignored him until he went away. When we were done (an hour and fifteen minutes later) guess what? The restaurant was STILL nowhere near capacity. There should have been no problem for that jackass to seat us outside or near the patio, he just wanted to be a jerk.",

PS: ok, i lied. i did remember ordering the rose margarita a few times and yummmm.",

When paying 12 per I expect more. We ordered enchiladas and tacos which were decent but the guacamole was a let down. Hardly seasoned. When we asked for them to make it spicy they wanted to charge us another 2.50. It's a small sum but when you're staying at the premier resort in the area I don't expect to be nickel and dimed for a spoon of jalapenos. Not to mention who doesn't offer guacamole at varying spice levels? Long story short its a bit out of the way but the local places in old town are well worth the cab ride. But also be weary of the cab company the hotel will recommend. They too price gouge you. Have them call discount cab instead.",

    "text": "My husband and I ate Sunday brunch at Rita's Kitchen located at the Camelback Resort. The brunch is cheaper in the summer during the off season, but unfortunately we arrived in town during the first week of the more expensive brunch. However, it was worth it! There are so many delicious selections ranging from American breakfast foods to authentic Mexican to crab legs and gourmet desserts. The service was exceptional and there was live music. I highly recommend reservations as most tables were full. Outside, shaded seating is available and I would recommend it weather permitting.  Now for some of my favorites....The fresh fruit was wonderful and tasted fresh picked. The shrimp and crab legs were perfect. There is a wide selection of artisan cheeses that paired nice with the other items. Don't forget to try some of the fresh made tortillas! My favorite desserts were the cheesecake, bread pudding, and chocolate cookies. Our waiter even gave us a to go box of cookies for later!",

    "text": "We have been coming to Rita's several times a year for the last several years.  Typically around holidays or other events that brought everyone to town. We would always come in with a large group, 2-4 families, with kids, plus grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. It was a great tradition - the food was good, beautiful setting, and pretty easy to have a large group with some wiggly kids.   BUT... the last few times we have been there it has gone down hill a lot. The food quality has decreased. Several items came out cold during our last visit, and when we brought it to the waitresses attention, she begrudgingly took the food back to the kitchen. While the food has been disappointing, the service has been terrible.  The last straw was during our last visit -- we had made a reservation ahead of time for our large group of 15. When we called, there was no mention of any automatic gratuity. We would have expected perhaps the usual 18% (although the service we were getting was NOT worth 18%). And it was not posted on their menu. Boy were we shocked when we got the check and they had added 22% (TWENTY-TWO percent gratuity). The check was over $300. So that's a huge, undeserving tip!  Given the price they are charging for their food and their reputation, I would really expect good to great food and exceptional service. We will not be back. It's a bummer because it is a beautiful and historic place (my grandparents used to stay here way back in the 50s). But the 22% automatic gratuity was so obnoxious, it's ridiculous.",

And live music everyday on the patio at 7. Valet parking is free.   I love to get their special margarita during happy hour, it's always something fun an different. The last one I had included thyme and it was yummy! Some of our favorite happy hour items are the salsa sampler, guac, carne asada tacos, chicken quesadilla, and filet mignon sliders all under $7. We usually get the salsa and and maybe 1 or 2 other items which easily make a full meal.   The large fire pits are a great spot to sit if you are looking to socialize with other guests. There's not an uncomfortable seat outside where you can't just sit back and relax, which you will since the service is also pretty relaxed.    Please note, they always ask us if we are a guest at the hotel or not when ordering and take our credit card if we are not.",

    "text": "Had dinner at Rita's last night on the patio following the Yelp Cocktail Society event.  I'm starting to become a bigger fan of resort restaurants.  Number one, they have gorgeous patios, Camelback Inn included, that exceed anything you find elsewhere.  Number two, nightly entertainment.  This comes with higher prices, but I'm already a fan before I even order.  But Rita's did not disappoint in that department either.  At our server's suggestion, we ordered the fish tacos (mahi mahi) and chicken enchiladas.  The tacos ($15) were served with ranchero beans and a brown vegetable rice.  Okay, let's get the one negative out of the way.  The rice was terrible.  Dry, flavorless.  Yep, tasted like brown rice.  The tacos, made with house-made corn tortillas, were really tasty.  The fish was well-seasoned and perfectly cooked.  The beans were delicious.  But lucky for me, the best meal was the enchiladas drenched in red pasilla sauce, cotija cheese, and topped with a creamy slaw.  Best enchilada sauce ever.  However, at $17 for two enchiladas, might I suggest they include a side dish?  Preferably the beans.  And let's not forget to mention the warm chocolate cookies with ice cream.  Order it if offered.  You will only be disappointed you only get 3.  We also had the chance to have the guacamole and the chips & salsa tree at the cocktail event.  The guacamole was really good, but seeing it for $15 on the menu, I don't know about that.  That's up there with paying $9 for a baked potato at a steak house.  I would, however, fork out the $7 for the chips & salsa which is served with four salsas.  The creamy verde was my favorite, but they were all good.  As for the service.  Jacqueline was really exceptional.  There was a miscommunication on my husband's drink order (mostly his fault), but she quickly rectified it.  And then when he ordered a second old-fashioned, she took it upon herself to take the time to get it from the event bar, rather than the restaurant bar, so that he could have a second wax-dipped glass after noticing we had one sitting at the table.  She also offered to bring us a bag to take home all the stuff we accumulated during the evening.  Ten stars for Jacqueline!  And now my friends, I must go eat my leftover enchilada.  All this talking about it...",

We started off with the chips and guac, which were fantastic-- very crisp but not stale chips, and guac that wasn't too salty or spicy, although they can make it as salty or as spicy as you like.  My boyfriend ordered a caesar, and I honestly think it's the best caesar I've ever had because the dressing was really creamy!  I had the shrimp enchiladas and a side of their corn, which they were nice enough to take off of the cob for me.  I love Mexican corn, and this was some of the best!  The enchiladas were great too.  My boyfriend had the seabass, and it was well cooked and had a pretty good flavor, although maybe not as rich as I prefer seabass to be.  I can't remember what our friends had, but I know they were happy as well.  The service was just as good as the food.  I would definitely recommend it!",

Went last night for Valentines day...granted, the Camelback Inn is the best in the world, with it's exclusive, one-in-a-million view of Camelback Mountain, but I must be honest, even when I adore a place! GOOD: The Atlantic salmon was exquisite as always.  We do not like the bitter-burp causing FIRE roasting (at any eatery) so we always request pan-seared fish. They always get it right, cooked through out and not burned on the surface...not old flavor, very fresh! The Caesar salad was the same as always...NO vinegar and yes, light anchovy flavor. The Reisling wine was typical Chateau St. Michelle and fresh, so it was good.  BAD: Raphael took our order and another person delivered salads with a friendly/professional persona, as did the next young lady who brought the fresh out-of-the-oven rolls.   We never saw Raphael again...until the check delivery. Finally Clemente strolled through,and we suspected he was either the wine steward or the manager...as soon as Raphael saw him with us...he promptly showed appeared. Clemente told him that he could bring the check.  UGLY: He never returned to see if dinner was ok. He never asked if we wanted another glass of wine, he never offered dessert menu. When someone else gave us the dessert list...no one followed up to take the order! So, we declined a complimentary dessert from Clemente and just wanted the check.   MANY dining on the favored patio and we were \"alone\" almost indoors...so, we were out of sight out of mind apparently!  WORST: From the moment Raphael arrived at out table, his breathe smelled of ALCOHOL! He bent over to hear me speaking when taking the orders...and there was no mistaking it!",

(Another man sitting at the next table eventually stood up to look for drier cushions, as well.)  Service was very friendly- that is, up until I paid, but more about this later.  Ordered the weekly drink special- the rose margarita.  Delicious!  Pretty, too.    For apps, I tried the Cilantro hummus ($2) and the Grilled steak skewers ($5).  Loved the hummus and pita, and the pita also paired well w/ the spicy cheese sauce that came w/ the steak skewers.  As for the skewers themselves... these were processed meat pieces, not from fresh steaks.  I did not appreciate the texture.  (I'm very interested to read about others' opinions on this dish.)  To think I received more satisfaction from a $2 dish and a cheese sauce!  At least the margarita was very good...  As I've said, the service was very friendly, and patient, answering all of my allergy concerns.  I had a very hard time securing a working outlet for my laptop, though, w/ my server and the assistant manager saying that the outlet that I found was \"out-of-service.\"  Yet, a third server/runner enthusiastically offered to get maintenance to have a look at the outlet, only to be intercepted by the asst. mgr., and suddenly, I was out of luck again.  Apparently, the asst. manager didn't want me to have use of my laptop while sitting outside.  Too bad, bec. I would've ordered another drink AND a dessert had I been able to stay much longer, but my dying battery had me packing and looking for an outlet to use elsewhere.  (Also, when it looked like I wasn't going to have access to an outlet, and after repeated visits from the server regarding dessert, I decided to ask for my receipt.  It took quite awhile to get the table ticket.  It seemed like when she knew I wasn't planning on ordering anything more, the friendly service disappeared.  Where once I had two or more reps coming over asking if I needed their assistance, I now couldn't even flag down one for a glass of water!)  I'd like to come back to surround myself again in such sensuous and verdant environs; I just will be sure not to visit right after it rains.  I may even just skip R-Bar and try Rita's Kitchen or BLT Steak's happy hour menus, instead.  Perhaps it's best not to return at all?  I wouldn't want to trouble the Camelback Inn staff to wait on a troublesome customer such as myself...",

And the view of the mountains at dusk are lovely as well.   Located off the main building where the pool used to be- during the recent renovation, they turned this space into one of my favorite areas at this resort. Nestle down into a comfy couch or chair with a loved one. Sit around one of the two fire pits in cozy chairs listening to the live music that begins each night around 7. Entertain a large party in the pergola. Listen to the many water features trickling and bubbling you into peaceful tranquility.   The service is spot on. You can order from the bar menu or if you are looking for a little more- ask for the restaurant menu and they will accommodate that as well. The food is quite good and trust me- during my stay- I think we sampled it all! Plenty of signature drinks, beers and wines to choose from.   So the next time you are looking for the perfect way to end or begin your evening in the area, stop into the R-Bar. This is Arizona living at it's finest.",

Since I have no idea what I'm talking about, here is the breakdown of our breakfast.  Waffles banana maple and bacon-not too bad.  The bacon was taken from the buffet.  It was like rubber. Eggs bennie was bland.  The coffees was low quality.  Not a good experience.  The wait person obviously hated her job and the bus boy was more helpful.  He clearly wants that job, he should have it.",

The bar can get loud that it can get distracting.  Dinner was just ok but breakfast was awesome.  The service in this entire resort is bar none. They truly care that you have a great experience.  Hostess and wait staff were just amazing.",

She came out to impatiently take our order but we had no menus. She brought menus and then disappeared again. We managed to get drinks but after she dropped them and 10 minutes went by, I went inside only to be further annoyed by the surly and unhelpful bartender. The other outside server was super nice. I wish she had been helping us. The resort is lovely but mediocre food and discourteous  staff do not warrant a return trip.",

    "text": "The R Bar has great specials on food and drinks during happy hour from 3:00-6:00, daily, which you can enjoy sitting up high on bar stools or sinking into a comfy low couch.  Thursday, my roommate and I enjoyed fish tacos, pan seared, NOT breaded and fried.  Two regular size tacos come folded in soft corn tortillas with crisp cabbage and veggies displayed in an ingenious zig-zag shaped metal holder with a side of salsa for $7.00. (I think they are $15 normally.  I had a glass of merlot off the happy hour menu and it wasn't bad.  Friday, my roommate ordered the chicken tacos and I ordered the lettuce wrap chicken fajitas.  The lettuce shell (several layers thick) was piled so high with yummy chicken and peppers that I had to eat a good bit of it before there was any hope of getting the lettuce to wrap around anything.  They should have called it the lettuce spilling out everywhere fajitas.  They arrived with sides of salsa and sour cream.  Saturday, we missed happy hour by a few minutes and ended up splitting a quesadilla that was very tasty.  I ordered a Kiltlifter from local Tempe, AZ brewery Four Peaks which I enjoyed immensely.  There was live music to help me get over my sadness at missing happy hour.  On Sunday, I rad the lettuce wrap fajitas again - they were just too good to keep switching, and another Kiltlifter.  My boss ordered the sliders and seemed to enjoy them.    They have live music nightly starting at 6:00 pm.",

The mountain views within the patio were beautiful and the buffet spread was top notch.  Dined on delicious crab claws, other seafood like scallops & shrimp, sushi rolls, prime rib, filet mignon, Mexican classics like carne asada & tacos, an array of salads, and more! The price for brunch is quite steep, but this is an opulent buffet with high-end dishes. To top it all off, the service was impeccable. Will return again with family!",

Ordered everything on the Happy hour just to sample. Go for the environment and enjoy :)  They also took my credit card when I wanted to pay cash and said at the end I can pay in cash which I did and then two days later saw my credit card was charged too :(  I was of course NOT happy about that and the time it took with the accounting department and my bank.

Not exactly a live music atmosphere.  I wish I could make a recommendation for a live music venue with a relaxed atmosphere. But most Phoenix musicians, and artists generally, make their money out of town.",

    "text": "This place could be so good but it's not.  We stayed at the camelback inn where this is located and really enjoyed it overall but when it came to trying to get service it was a nightmare.  We talked to the hostess and she had no open tables outside but said it was open seating outside the r bar so we sat at a table outside there.  Several servers said they would be right there but even after trying to flag someone down they wouldn't take our order.  So we went back in to see if we could be seated at an indoor table since it appeared much less busy.  We ended up getting some food but you could tell the wait staff was grumpy and didn't check in on us once we finally did make contact.  We should have known this would be the case since the first night we were staying at the resort we came to Rita's and the hostess kept saying your server Kyle will be right over but he never showed up so she just took the order herself after a very long wait.  I get the impression the focus here is on the group events.  Every night we were here there was either weddings or corporate events that dominated most of the space.  Part of staying at a resort is being able to eat there and you really can't plan to eat at Rita's or r bar.  It's weird cause I didn't have a problem that pina coladas are $15, I just couldn't find anyone to sell me any.",

They also have live music on the patio, there was an acoustic band playing Beetles songs when we went.  I would definitely recommend sitting on the patio if it is nice outside.",
