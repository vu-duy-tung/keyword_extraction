The owner was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. My family and I order Indian at least once or twice a month. Our favorite dish is chicken tikka masala and biryani. And to be honest this is the best chicken tikka masala we have ever had. Most places over due the butter and cream leaving it very thick and heavy. We wanted to keep eating even though we were full. I highly recommend new India gate, and will definitely be in for the buffet soon.",

They don't skimp on the naan either. You got 4 large pieces at a time. Others only give you a piece or two at a time. I was able to try both and actually liked the plain better. Servers were very friendly and took my plate as soon as I was finished and kept my glass full. I guess a family owns it, mother, father and two sons. The dad is legit with a turban and a huge smile ready to get you what you need. For desert I had some of the best rice pudding I have ever had at an Indian buffet, and you can never go wrong with the gulab jaman. All you can eat for less than 10 bucks! I'll be back soon!",

The lamb was sooooo tough and hard to even chew. It had some sort of \"left over from a few days\" taste. There was no \"achari\" taste to the lamb. I would say this dish/recipe failed. The Shrimp vindaloo had no vindaloo flavoring, again dish/recipe failed. Now the pricing, the prices were high for the amount of food provided in each dish. The only positive was the Naan, it was soft and good. Overall, I would say our experience with the food was - i have had better Indian food elsewhere!",

I'm pretty sure that the rice was reheated leftovers (it was dry and kind of clumpy), and the raita is the simply the worst I've ever had. It was like a bowl of milky water with weird lumps in it. I overheard one of the young gentlemen owners tell another table that the problem was a lack of access to reliably good milk. That is the biggest bunch of baloney. Hahaha! Look, if you can't make a decent yogurt from scratch for your raita, buy yogurt. Given the choice between having to tell customers \"Sorry, we don't have raita tonight\" versus serving that mess, go with the former, please. Now, on the upside, the rest of our meal was good, and the kitchen got our food out quickly. All in all, just based on one visit, I'd say that the \"New\" India Gate is a fine place to satisfy your Indian food cravings, but it's nowhere near my first choice.",

Normally I prefer seafood, but he was not wrong about the lamb... the lamb was soooooo tender and delicious, despite the hellishly spicy Indian-hot spice level I ordered. That was my doing though, and honestly I regret nothing because it was so delicious. Thanks for a great experience. I have to run the rounds and check out some other Indian places but you are number one on the list right now.   Was there supposed to be potatoes & tomatoes & chili peppers in the stew? Because it was only meat chunks, but the sauce was so thick I can't help but wonder if they are pureed into the sauce. I am very new to Indian cuisine, and again, I have no complaints, because it was sooo yummy.   Also, boyfriend brings home chicken tikka masala leftovers on a weekly basis, and even leftovers of that shit is dope. This is why I picked this place to try! Passed on lunch buffet (seems like a great deal) as they didn't have what I wanted to try.   Wish the rice were seasoned, only main complaint. And then every other reviewer chats up the garlic naan but it just tasted like American-ass pizza/garlic bread, just thinner. I was disappointed because that's what I wanted but turned out they had even tastier things to offer. Also was kinda bummed about the paneer pakora. It was so good, but basically cheesesticks with the added bonus of spinach. Once it was cool enough to eat, the cheese had solidfied (and i order cheese things because melty cheese is so amazing haha)  You have your pick of sweet & sour or mint for dipping, and the mint/herb sauce on the side is divine!",

Pakoras were oily but not crispy. All the curries were bland. Chicken teeka was like chicken pieces in red cream. Only thing spicy on the buffet was chicken biryani. Taste wise it was ok, but had an over cooked texture. The rice grains were smashed or broken with the chicken. For anyone who likes like spicy AUTHENTIC Indian food, this place is NOT for him/her.  I would rate the food (entrees and appetizers) 2 star. That extra star is for service( which was great), garlic naan and gajar halwa. And yeah also for the price point.",

We walked in 15 minutes before the restaurant actually opened.  We warmly welcomed and seated promptly.  A young gentleman quickly came over and welcomed us again.  He took our drink order and offered nan bread with our choice of flavor.  A few minutes later we were told the buffet was ready and we were invited to serve ourselves.  Everything in the buffet looked freshly prepared.  We sat down with our plate and upon our first bite we were hooked.  The food is delicious and the customer service is beyond great.  The two brothers who run this restaurant are constantly aware of customers needs and always willing to answer any questions about the food.  We will definitely return soon.",

We got naan-garlic and plain. The service was great, we were greeted promptly and asked if we needed any help. We placed our order and it came out in about 15 minutes.  Got home and tried everything. It was lacking flavor which doesn't really happen in Indian food. Spice levels were underwhelming. We didn't go again for leftovers. Nothing stood out, overall less than mediocre but service was good.",

Had a bunch of stuff, took home some leftovers.  We had a goat dish (off menu) and some of the cauliflower (forgot the name of the vegetarian dish) and some tandoori chicken.  Chicken was very juicy, everything was great.    Will absolutely go back.  We were the last one there and were not rushed.

I ordered a tandoori chicken, two breads, and qeema/beef samosa.  The tandoori chicken was almost raw/uncooked from the inside and the beef inside samosas was just nasty in simple terms.  It looked very raw as well.  I have no idea what happened here but the food tonight was very bad, which is unusual for this place.    Tandoori chicken was not charcoaled whatsoever, it appeared to be boiled chicken dumped into some kind of a sauce.  I've had tandoori chicken at many Indian places but nothing like this, sorry I have to disagree with the manager.  Your tandoori chicken is NOT tandoori!",

The buffet was fully stocked and restocked when a tray became low. The staff was so attentive... they are raising the bar in the area.   This place is great, don't hesitate. Go now!",

    "text": "My mom and I came here when we realized that one of our other favorite Indian food restaurants was closed on Mondays and I'm happy we did! We had the lunch buffet which was, first off, super cheap!  Now for the food- the food was good. It was not the best Indian food I've had in Phoenix for sure. Even among buffets it is not the best. They gave us a choice of garlic or regular naan. We went for the garlic naan and it was awesome. I really enjoyed the tandoori chicken and this beef and pea thing (I have absolutely no idea what it was called). Other things that I typically enjoy and are standard for Indian buffets-- butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, and saag paneer were all average. If there dinner food tasted like that, I probably wouldn't order anything listed above. The dessert here was also pretty good but standard. They had rice kheer and Gulab jamun.   The food was a solid three stars and honestly good for $7.99. I hope they work on improving the depth of flavor that is usually found in Indian food.   The restaurant itself also gets 3 stars. It was super clean which is awesome, but on the day we were there their AC must have been broken or really high- definitely not something you want in an AZ summer.  Aside from price, the reason this place gets 4 stars and not 3 is that the service is stellar. Our waiter was awesome and genuinely cared about our meal. The manager (I think) also came by and you could tell that he genuinely cared about the restaurant. I definitely see a lot of potential for this restaurant!",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try Indian Food for a very long time.  Convincing my husband to try it with me took years.  I was pleasantly surprised when my hubby stopped here on our mini date night.  The room was smaller than we thought it would be but ended up being perfect! It was so relaxing. And quiet. I had a lovely glad of wine, and hubby tried Taj Mahal beer. Nothing particularly special about the wine. It had nice notes and was served in a perfect amount not chinsey at all. The beer however i had a sip it was crisp and clean but also left a pleasant reminder on The pallet.   The service/servers were so helpful in giving us recommendations and telling us what was most authentic. They were kind and patient. Overall very friendly and polite.  We enjoyed the veggie appetizer. The chickpea batter was on point!! The veggie fritter type item was my fave. Full of flavor , crispy, and great with the sauces they brought to the table.  The Potato samosa thing was also very good.  Seasoned beautifully.  There was a delicious cracker item they bring to the table that was dlish. The sauces one green had a bit of heat to it.  The brownish red sauce kinda Smokey,  kinda sweet was my fave.  Hubby had tive lamb vindaloo. He liked it quite a bit.  Said his lamb was cooked perfectly,  wansn't to soft had just the right bite to it. He got a medium spice, but said he should have done more heat. He likes spicy. I did taste the sauce it was rich and i could really taste the tomato base each flavor really stood on its own despite the level of spice.  I cannot remember what the name of my meal choice was.  It was recommend by the server. Loved that they had so much vegetarian items.... in my meal the sauce was amazing!! It was kinda sweet and creamy, so rich, full of spices. ..i could have swam in it it was so amazing. I soaked it up with garlic naan bread which was on its own a nice treat.  Back to my awesome meal; it had these veggie dumpling things in it which complimented the sauce nicely,  or maybe it was supposed to be the other way around. I cannot wait to return and try something new.  Maybe stop by for the lunch buffet.",

One thing I love about Indian food is that it is even better the next day. My Matter Paneer was good at the restaurant, but somehow when it's a day old and has been nuked, then it's fantastic!  Only downside to this restaurant was the service. Note to Manager: When a customer has been given their food, someone should come over and check that it is good BEFORE the customer has finished eating. I would have raved to the server about the food, but didn't get a chance. It's not like the place was busy - we were the only customers there.  But the food was great so we will be going back. I'd love to try the buffet, but then I won't get my \"day-old\" nuked food the next day! Decisions, decisions! :0)  5 stars for the food, 1 star off for the service.",

Ended up going with my usual Chicken Tikka Masala which was good I thought but I feel that I should have gotten something new and different here, will have to ask for recommendations next time. However, the garlic naan here is simply unbelievable! It's some of the best garlic naan that I had and would highly recommend anyone coming here to try it as well.

I did notice that their level of spiciness in the food is a lot milder then what I'm use too which I'm sad about, but I can see why they do it since a lot of people can't handle it. Other then that take the chance and go!",

You cannot beat this deal. $9.99 for a full buffet filled with great curries, rices, samosas, and desserts. This was my first Indian buffet that I've been to but I imagine that this place is at the top of the list. The curries were super flavorful and I love how I was able to try multiple things. The samosas were super delicious, crispy on the outside and there was a ton of filling. They also brought out garlic naan to the table too. To top it all off, the service was incredible. Everybody was super nice and accommodating and you can tell that they truly care about their customers. I would HIGHLY recommend this place. Great deals, great food, great service.",

I have been impressed with their food but this was nothing close to what they used to offer.  The buffet is priced at $9.95 on weekends. The spread was average no appetizers  Chicken biriyani was in a sorry state, curries were just Okay. Dishes were not being refilled.  Garlic naan was brought to the table which was great other items like basmati rice, custard and Kheer were fresh. Gulab jamun was outright bad  We barely touched our food.  Not going back for the buffet. Cheers!",

The buffet is my husband and my fav. We did it 3x a week back in the day. My work schedule changed so we can't come as much but we would! It's always better during the week (and cheaper too) so just come then!   Dinner is harder to justify for us because it's a little pricer than our usual go-tos. Still worth it if you want the best Indian in the valley ",

We were seated immediately. It was around noon on a Tuesday, but there were only a couple of other people in the restaurant, which was a little odd.  The buffet had a great variety of typical Indian favorites, and a few not as well known dishes. The rice was well cooked, fragrant, and hot. The only real downfall is that the food lacked a bit of spice. I know that's typical with buffets because they want to tone it down a notch for the average person, but I feel like it was toned down too much. Even so, I really enjoyed it and will definitely be back!",

    "text": "This is a review of the lunch buffet, and the experience thereof.   First off, this restaurant has a really nice space. The whole dining area feels very light and airy, it's beautiful.   Secondly, the service was really great. I don't particularly care about being greeted and bid goodbye when I go to restaurants, but if you do - this is a great place! Very friendly, polite, and prompt all around.   Also, while I was there, another customer asked for an accessibility accommodation, and the guy at the counter immediately was like, oh sure yeah - so, if you need to ask for accommodations, seems like probably you'd have a good chance of not being rebuffed (which, I don't have any physical disabilities, so I guess take that with a grain of salt - but I know ppl who need accommodations often hesitate to go places b/c they're not sure if they'll get them, and that is often not mentioned in reviews) and it is also apparently wheelchair accessible.   My only point of hesitation in recommending it is the food which is like - I wanna say up front, it's not bad, in fact it is quite good, but I think your experience of it will be based on expectation and personal taste. For MY tastes, it was a bit more mild than I like, and the saag paneer was a bit thinner than my preference. But, that's me, and the other veg offerings - potato and bell pepper, rice, black lentils, mutter paneer - were very good, as was the kheer. They also had gulab jamun, but I did not try it, b/c honestly gulab jamun is a bit sweet for my tastes and it's just not my favorite.   Oh also, plain or garlic naan is brought to the table, and I had the garlic naan, and it was very garlicky and very good.   I don't think this will become a staple of my routine b/c it's honestly kind of a drive for me, but I think it deserves its high rating here, and if you're nearby and aren't a spice hound, definitely check out the buffet.",

Coming from Indian background, I cannot give more than 2 stars.  Went for weekday lunch buffet.  The food quality was subpar.  Chicken Tikka masala, sag paneer and Dal were quite watery.  The flavors were on the lighter side.  Tandoori Chicken did not feel fresh (stale) and did not taste the Tandoori that I am used to.  Biriyani barely had any chicken. The dessert felt flat.  Gullab jamun  was not served warm and missed the taste mark as well.  Liked the atmosphere.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.",

They have a casual but clean restaurant. They seemed to have a good lunch buffet going. We ordered the chicken biriyani and tandoori mixed platter. We got it Indian hot which was quite spicy so if be careful before you order it. We enjoy spicy food so we liked it.  The food was above average and better than a lot of the other AZ Indian joints. Being a big fan of Indian food I have a high standard for Indian food.  The meat was moist and not dried out. The biriyani was well spiced and had a good amount of meat in it. The mango lassi was really good.  Will probably come back again. Would like to try the lunch buffet some time.",

We were greeted, seated promptly, and everyone we came into contact with was polite. Seriously some of the best service I've ever had at ANY restaurant.   Now for the most important part: phenomenal food! I started off with a chai tea and I haven't stopped thinking about it since... the chai is a must! They also brought us over some complimentary pappadam with some mint and mango chutneys on the side. Both were delicious. Entree-wise I recommend the madras vegetables--easily the best I've ever had. (It's my go-to Indian food order so I consider myself somewhat of an aficionado.) The paratha and lamb vindaloo were also delicious. The medium was not very spicy so if you like hot, get hotter than you normally would.   My partner and I ate all our food which is unusual for us; it was just THAT good! It's important to note that entree portions were a little smaller than Indian restaurants usually are, but in the end we didn't mind that much because we firmly believe in quality over quantity. It was still reasonably priced at about $40 for the two of us.   This was an awesome find and we can't wait to go back!",

I will be back for more.**  I had a wonderful dinner and got to try something new.  I really wanted the lamb ashoka, that's lamb cooked in the juice from Indian pickle.  Our waiter brought out a little dish of the sauce for me to try, and it was delicious.  It would have killed me, though.  My stomach just won't put up with that kind of thing any more.  I'd never seen this dish any place else and so I learned something new, which is cool.  I ended up going with my standby mattar paneer, which was excellent.  As usual, I ate too much.  There's always room for kheer as far as I'm concerned.  The kheer was also wonderful.  Try this place if you're needing a fix of Indian food.  I can't wait for the next visit.  And I definitely have try the lunch buffet!  **its anchari not asoka**my bad**",

We encountered three waiters and every single one was super nice and they all answered any questions we had.  This was my first time eating Indian food and I am a fan. My husband had the chicken masala spice level 7 and I had a shrimp dish (I can't remember the exact name) spice level 5. We each ordered a side of basmati rice and garlic naan. Everything was absolutley delicious and not too spicy. We ended the meal with the deep fried cheese dessert which was amazing.   When you come across a place like this you want to tell everyone! There is a shortage of places to eat where not only is the service excellent, but the food is as well. They don't get all of these amazing ratings for nothing, so go check them out! I can't wait to go back!",

They had no Dal or plain rice. It was just Pulav with raitha. Their naan's were amazing, but when we asked for the second serving, the attendant passed a comment saying we were his naan monsters. He might have done it on a lighter note, but given that we were 4 people and the just gave 4 pirces in each serving, we were left with no option but to ask for more. They had not much options for rice at all. They were serving Gulab Jamun cold and when asked if they had a hot Gulab Jamun, he said Jamun was never meant to be had hot. When asked if they had Dosa, he asked me what is Dosa and starred at me as if I had asked if they serve the moon :) Nevertheless, I gave my feedback at the end and he said \"Every restaurant is different and its upto the customer to decide where they want to go\". Regretting having given my feedback and making a wrong choice of restaurant, we walked out disappointed.   I agree that the restaurant has all the rights to decide their menu and the taste depends on the chef. But when given feedback, they could have courteously received it and acknowledged it instead of passing such rude comments. I wish I could give 0 stars, but couldn't appease myself with it as their naan was good and the chef probably has been putting in a lot of effort to make this food. I wouldn't recommend this place if you want to try out varieties or would like to have a good dining experience.",

One of the owners explained each item on the menu and told us about how it is cooked, spices used, and went on to recommend different things we could try. We ordered what he suggested and it was fabulous!! It wasn't expensive and we felt it was well worth every penny! We will surely go back for the buffet this time so we can try different things!! We live in North Dakota and visit about every 6 weeks. This will be one place we eat each visit!",

That being said, I was really impressed with the food at New India Gate. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere when we walked in and we were greeted right away. We actually had several servers through the evening and my favorite was a well-dressed younger man who was very attentive (might have been a manager or owner?)  I ordered chicken tikka masala and some samosas. We got a little appetizer of a crispy cracker-like think with some sauces that was really tasty (sorry, don't know what it's called--told you I was new!) and then the samosas came out. We did some veggie and some meat and they were great--the veggie, in particular. However, we did have to wait quite a bit for our main dish to come out. The guy did stop by to apologize for the wait and I saw him and the others doing their best to get food out as soon as it was ready. It was worth the wait because it was all very good. I got mine mild and it was just right for me. Also enjoyed the garlic naan but I would suggest they add jasmine rice to the menu instead of or in addition to the standard white rice. They were offering a yelp deal for new customers which we took advantage of and the ticket was really quite reasonable. I'd absolutely go back and would recommend over the other ones that I've tried in Tempe.",

The chicken tandoori was raw, the chicken dum biryani( it is not even called a biryani), curries had no flavor, the desserts were not good( the fruits in the mango custard were not fresh, the carrot halwa( I don't want to call it a Halwa. Very bad!!!)). It's good that we have tried the food before ordering for our party. We have ordered at \"Kabab palace\", \"Pastries N chaat\" and \"Chennai Fusion Grill\" for our previous parties and the food was never a fail. We love those places. This time we just thought we will try something new but we absolutely regret going to this place. We will never recommend this place to anyone( friends, family and colleagues).

After looking at reviews on yelp, I found this restaurant and called in an order on my way home. I ordered the chicken tikka masala (medium spice), basmati rice, and plain naan. It was delightful! I always over estimate the amount of spice I like in my Indian food, so I may order the spice level lower next time, but that's on me. The amount of food you get for the price is good, even without the 20% discount right now. I am new to the area, and from what I understand the owners had a restaurant before and have recently moved to this location on Ray, but you can tell they have been in the business quite a while from their warm welcome when I arrived to their flawless execution of my dish and the dishes I saw when there.

The garlic naan was okay but wished it would not have been just four small soggy slices and just out of the oven.  The sauces on the vidaloo and korma were flavorable and fresh tasting.   Some of the chicken was fatty.  My husband prefers white meat but the dark was fine for me.  We ate everything served.  Next time we will request chicken breast meat.",

I found out about them during the Asian Festival the other weekend, and am so glad I made the drive to their location   I tried their lunch buffet, which had a 4 veggie-friendly options, a few different choices in meat (chicken, lamb, etc), and lots of desserts (the best part, yay!) Plus the buffet comes with complimentary garlic or regular naan, as well as chai tea..   I sampled pretty much everything, and could decide on my favorite dish, it was that good! The servers and owners were very welcoming, and quick to answer any questions. It was a great experience all around, and I'll definitely be back when I'm craving Indian food again!",

    "text": "I see people giving like 1-sentence reviews of this place. I get it, words are hard and all, but you're not just talking about Taco Bell...this is New India Gate.  This restaurant is fantastic.  The interior is immaculately clean and spacious, and that lunch buffet cannot be beat.  I could sit there and much on saag paneer and tikka masala and naan all freaking day.  But like...that's a lunch buffet.  Even the best buffet can only be so good, so then why the 5 stars?  I'll tell you why the 5 freaking stars you nosy jerks: because New India Gate gives a crap.  Because I once ordered New India Gate via Postmates or UberEats or RideShareFoodsters or whatever, and it was a fairly hearty order - some chicken tikka masala, some chicken vindaloo (as hot as they'll make it...delicious), some samosas, some garlic naan.  You should have SEEN this order.  It was packaged immaculately.  Each individual food container was wrapped in some cling wrap to prevent spilling any of the saucy entrees. The different types of naan were wrapped in their own foil to keep them warm.  And then once all those beautiful little packages were unwrapped, what we were greeted with was food.  Glorious, colorful, flavorful, plentiful food.  Food rife with delicate sauces and perfectly cooked rice and delicious naan.  This food was even better than the buffet food even though both were arguably of about the same freshness, and I think some of that is just the care put into these individual meals. All special requests were followed religiously.    That meal was so good that exactly one week later, we ordered again.  Not the exact same meal, but close.  Same wrapping. Same packaging. Same level of amazingness to the food.  So we ordered again the next week.  At this point it's more often than not that we order New India Gate on a Sunday night...not out of some obligation to a ritual, but just because it just so happens that by the time a 7th day is about to pass, we realize it has been too long since we had New India Gate and we need to have it again.    I love you, New India Gate.",

At a couple of other places where the food is good, the service has been indifferent or even surly. But here they seem genuinely happy to see you and super friendly and funny.   Craig: That's True. I agree. And the food is also excellent. I haven't had a bad dish.   Me: Yes! The food has been amazing every time. And we've been here three times each, twice together. Some places are hit or miss, but this place is consistently good.   Craig: The standout favorite is the chicken tikka masala. But the garlic naan is also naan-stop.   Me: I'm not typing that. Pick another adjective.   Craig:  Me: Fine. *rolls eyes* The beef samosas were good. I like their papadam and tamarind sauce. And we've had the aloo ghobi and aloo matar, which were both very tasty.   Craig: I'd order any of that again, but there are so many options I'd like to try out some other items.   Me: I also like the airy, spacious feeling of the restaurant. And I like the shiny wall. It's definitely not super decorated, but it's nice and feels neat and clean.   Craig: Yeah, clean and modern. And the music is nice in the background. It's there, but it's not oppressive.   Me: This place isn't busy on weeknights. Frankly, it should be much busier, but I kind of love that I don't have to wait. And I love that they never close. Like ever. Sunday, Monday, holidays, zombie apocalypse. Whatever. They're open.   Craig: I feel like we skimmed over the service too quickly. They've earned more screen time.   Me: Definitely! They'll give you honest opinions about what's best on your menu. Your drink will never have a chance to get below the halfway mark. But they never feel like they're crowding you.   Craig: I think you've covered it.  Me: We never talked about the stars.   Craig: It was a given maybe.   Me: Yeah, five stars for service and food. Four and a half stars on the decor.",

Most of the food was missing the authentic Indian flavor. Everything was too bland and had absolutely no taste. My stars go for the ambience, its clean and for the garlic naan, chicken tikka masala. I hardly had rest of the food, the chicken tandoori was the worst.   It was my first experience and I am never coming back again. The price is really not worth for the food they serve here.

The bold flavors perfectly infused into the chicken biryani and the lamb bhuna are amazing!  It just doesn't end there, their chana, chicken curry, goat curry and chicken tikka masala is awesome and delicious.  This hidden gem is in my opinion is the best in the valley and in the state.

New India Gate is the perfect place to do so! Nested in a shopping mall, the outside of the building is not very welcoming. However as soon as you step foot into the restaurant, the staff greets you and shows you to your table. Our waiter was very polite and very friendly, we were asked if we wanted plain or garlic bread. Of course we took the garlic one!  There is no menu at the table since it's a lunch buffet, we waited to get our sodas then we decided to jump in! There is a wide variety of choices from a spinach dish (one of my favorite by the way) to tandoori chicken. Even if you are vegetarian, you will find something delicious to eat.  Every employee that came to our table were very nice, we weren't rushed to finish our plates or anything. You actually have to go to the counter/bar to pay, which is totally fine. The lunch buffet is $7.99, seriously!  If we ever crave for Indian food for lunch, I know where I'm going!",

    "text": "Had a wonderful evening with my wife. This restaurant sure did pass the Indian/Punjabi litmus test. We ordered saag(cooked mustard leaves) and onion kulcha(stuffed bread with onion, potatoes). Both these dishes were completely amazing! The saag was perfect and reminiscent of the authentic way it is prepared back at home. No extra cream or oil was added and had a subtle blend of spices. Similarly, the kulcha was original without any frills. We also ordered pistachio kulfi. It's basically a semi-solid frozen dessert which gave us both the final aa-ha moment!  As a sidekick they also serve Indian beers which, are 8% alcohol with 650ml volume, twice as effective as American beers. In case anyone is up for a trip!  Service was great, everyone is attentive and takes good care of you. I also heard some good Punjabi music. They, definitely deserve a five star.",

The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated - it wasn't busy, but I was there early.  When I arrived, my to go order wasn't quite ready and they invited me to have some water and to try some of the snacks at the buffet bar.  I can't remember the name, but one was like the papadam bread I have had in other indian restaurants, but I think they are called something else here.  Also the little dessert doughnut type balls in syrup - so good!  I really appreciated that they made me feel welcome - that counts for so much!  We ordered the tandoori chicken, the chicken makhni, aloo gobhi and the bengan bharta along with some naan breads.  Everything was great! We ordered it \"medium\" spicy and while the bengan bharta was pretty spicy the others came out pretty mild - will kick it up next time.  Portions were good sized - definitely enough for dinner plus a couple meals afterwards.    My only complaint: I did wish we got some raita, green sauce and chutney as side condiments though.  I am used to getting small portions of those along with your to go order without having to ask or pay extra.",

This place is run by two brothers and their dad is the chef. Only one of the brothers were there and he was very attentive and I liked that he engaged in conversation with us. Granted my friends are regulars here and the owners know them,  Golbi introduced himself & was very friendly. I started off with the vegetable samosa which was delicious. It comes with two sauces (Tamarind & mint chutney). the green sauce reminds me of a green chili salsa and the red one is sweet & tangy. Both compliment the samosas very well. Then I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo and asked for Indian Hot since I love spicy food. I ordered a side of rice with my dish or you can order a side of the garlic naan that is just as good. If you got an appetite then get both :)  Overall  the food was delicious, service was great and it's a great new addition to the Chandler area. The owner also is working on getting his alcohol license so expect to see some great beer selection coming soon!",

    "text": "Best tandoori chicken I've ever had!  This place is really good.  I liked every dish I tried and you could tell it was all homemade.  I got there right when they opened for the lunch buffet.  I got first dibs on all the new stuff they were bringing out and it was hot and fresh.  I always have a hard time remembering the names of most dishes, but they were all very good.  The chicken tikka masala was also amazing.  The spice level was perfect, just enough to make my nose run a bit.  I can tell this place has a strong grasp on spice use and levels and are masterful at bringing it right to the edge for buffet food that everyone can eat it and everyone will be pleased.  They fill your water as soon as you walk in and give you the option of plain or garlic naan.  I opted for garlic.  It's not as crispy as I'm used to, but it's still really good, and I think most people prefer the way it's prepared here vs. the crackery crispy type that I've had elsewhere.  This is strictly personal preference.  I spoke with the owner during my meal and he was very friendly and gave me a history of the restaurant, how long they've been open and their philosophy that \"everything we serve here is what we eat at home\".  It shows in their food for sure.  It's cool to have the actual owner tell you that his father is cooking for you the same thing he cooks at home for his own family.  The lunch buffet price is very reasonable.  Definitely go for the buffet to get a wide variety of everything.  They have a large selection, a nice salad section as well as several sauces which is very rare for an Indian buffet.  It's nice to have those sauces available.  My only one gripe.  My lady was unable to go with me on that day, so I promised to bring her home a dish.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala to go.  The owner asked me if I just want some from the buffet or they can make it scratch.  I opted to go with from scratch and asked for mild, since my girl doesn't need her food to be hot for her to enjoy it.  When he brought it out, it was a medium sized cup container of the entree, but there was no side of rice or naan bread.  Just the dish.  I don't know if he just kind of misunderstood what I was asking for, but I was charged more for the little cup of food than i was for the three plates (yes i had three don't make fun) of food I had at the buffet.  Maybe the owner can comment and I will switch to 5 stars if maybe I was confusing the way I ordered to go.  If not, I think this place would be perfect if they were to include a cup of rice and maybe a naan bread to make it worth the price.  The restaurant is clean and they opt to play Indian music with a contemporary twist, so you get a little something for everyone.  They keep the buffet very clean, they are attentive and fill your water constantly, which is good because this food can be spicy.",

Good selection in the lunch buffet and great service all around, from the initial greeting to paying the check. If you are looking to try Indian food or just need your \"Indian food fix\" like me, go here. Will definitely be returning for their dinner menu. Family run business the delivers on quality and value.",

Our garlic naan wasn't greasy and was perfectly balanced as to not overpower our food. I had the chicken vindaloo, which I will gladly eat again. My boyfriend had the chicken saag, also delicious, smooth and creamy.   The service was great too. We sat next to what seemed like a difficult table and the server/owner handled them with such grace offering suggestions and detailed explanations. He even looked at another restaurant's menu that the customer pulled up to show her what would be similar on his menu. He was very friendly to us as well. I wish them much success and will definitely be back.",

We did the lunch buffet which everyone else was doing as well. First of all, the service was friendly and quick. They refilled our drinks and took away empty plates quickly. The food itself was not the best, but it was good. I will have to go back to see if it was a one day thing, but the reason I decided to round down and give 3 stars only was because the meat dishes (especially the tikka masala) was almost without meat for the entire time we were there. I realize that it is a popular dish, but to not have it restocked was disappointing. Also, since there were so many people, the naan was only given in small amounts.",

Bland if not gross and most of the food was barely warm. By comparison the Indian restaurant in civic plaza is amazing.  Definitely don't waste your time or appetite here.  Sorry Indian Gate.  I wanted to like you and drove all the way over.",

    "text": "We've found it! So excited. Love New India Gate. When you walk in you are greeted like friends or family and the comfortable warm decor makes you feel instantly at home. The servers are so attentive your drinks are replaced before they're  empty. Restaurants that provide this level of service deserve that fifth star and combined with the excellent food make this a must if you're in the area looking for good Indian. They start off with the appetizer: thin crunchy popadoms and dipping sauces which I really like to start this type of meal. Next we ordered ground beef samosas which were flavorful, the meat tender, and the dough just right in consistency. For my main I had the chicken tikka masala which was like heaven since I have not had good Indian in a while. Just this side of sweet which is fine because the sauce had the exact combinations of ingredients that I prefer. Delicious. I ate every bite and used my garlic naan to soak up the sauce. Oink! Exactly what my taste buds wanted. My better half chose a mild lamb dish called khorani and it came in the cutest warmer! So super tender and flavorful that I might order it next time! The food was served family style which we like because we almost always share. My glass was never more than 1/4 empty, the friendly staff made sure of it. It was nice chatting with several of them until we overheard the folks at the next table raving about the custard. Of course we had to try it! Mango custard, very soft with fruit stirred in. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOh.my&s=98edab0cb2c458afb9b59a25bbadcf0054149a3363212accbb9e496ac87121c5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oh.my</a>.god. So good. I don't think I could replicate it with its lovely taste and so creamy. So as mentioned we found our go to and I want the owners to know just how awesome the staff are, they are half the reason we loved it here!",

The lunch buffet is great.  Dinners are fantastic as well.  You can't go wrong on either option.    I know that so many people are focused on the food, and rightly so.  However, I want to highlight the amazing service that New India Gate has.  The servers (also owners?) that we typically see, have consistently provided excellent service to us each time we are there.  We have never had bad service here.  They are so very nice and personable.  They have offered to go above and beyond to accommodate my wife and I to ensure that our meal is the most enjoyable.  These guys have absolutely nailed it as far as customer service goes.  I cannot say enough good things about them as people.  The food is wonderful and that alone makes New India Gate a stand out restaurant, but what make it a 5 star establishment is the food + the wonderful service.   Well done!",

Our usual favorites are the vegetable samosa, paneer saag, paneer tikka masala, chicken tikka masala, and chicken vindaloo.  Their tikka masala gravy is honestly the best I've ever had. This isn't just my opinion but also the opinions of my foodie friends. You definitely should try it! The meal is not complete unless you order a side of garlic naan and a mango lassi! My gosh, my mouth is watering as I'm currently writing this. To add to how delicious their dishes are...the customer service is always outstanding and the restaurant is always clean. I'm so happy I have a place like this not too far from home for takeout dinners as well :) We recommend this place to all of our friends and hope you enjoy your dining experience here as much as we do!",

The pickled lemons and peppers were not only available, but were some of the best pickles I've ever had.  Just the right amount of saltiness.  The karahi paneer's consistency seemed a bit off.  The paneer was good, but semi-raw red peppers just threw the whole thing off.  I didn't really like the lamb achari either.  Usually I can tease out the different flavors.  This achari just seemed to have one flavor and it wasn't that great.  The space is typically sparse.  The service was very good.",

I've long been a fan of Indian food and have been searching the valley for my favorite.  New India Gate did a great job last night with the food and even more so on the service side of the house.  The people running the restaurant were wonderfully friendly, professional, and a joy to talk to.  The server was exceptional and we never needed anything throughout the evening.    The food was very good as well and started with a table share of papadum which was good but could have been a touch crispier.  A Veg korma, chicken tikka masala, a lamb in a rich wonderful sauce, and a biryani dish all followed and were very good.  Of course we asked for tons of Naan which if I make it to heaven, will just be laying around me at all times.  I have no idea why I love it so much but we tried their plain and garlic and both were legit.    Surprisingly nice beers here on tap which is always a plus offering your standard Taj Mahal and Kingfisher but also had some nice \"micros\" like Voodoo Ranger, a nice juicy IPA from New Belgium Brewing.  Looking forward to hitting their lunch buffet soon to check that out but I certainly will be back to New India Gate for tasty food and awesome service.",

We went right at 5 and the restaurant surprising was getting full by 6. My husband and I LOVED our dishes- the best Indian food we have ever had in Phoenix. The server told us his father is the cook and he is always there he never lets anyone else cook to keep their quality high. We had our toddler with us and they even brought him out his own rice on the house. When we couldn't decide on dessert he brought us a sample of the one we decided against. Seriously the best customer service and food. We went for dinner but are ready to go back for the lunch buffet so we can try several dishes at one. Defiantly give this place a shot!",

The malai kofta was burned on the inside of the kofta balls and the rest of the curry had a burned flavor as a result. The naan was thin and chewy instead of being thick and soft. They charge for rice which I personally feel is a rip off. The only thing they had that was okay in our opinion was the chicken tikka masala and even that was lacking. In my opinion, the reason this place gets high ratings is the service and ambience is really nice especially when compared to other Indian restaurants in the local area. But the food itself did not impress and I would recommend driving to Phoenix or Scottsdale for real Indian food in my opinion.",

Every dish I tried was packed with flavor and the service was excellent.  It's a family run business with two very kind brothers taking care of the front of the house and their parents back in the kitchen cooking great food.  We were told that their meat is locally sourced and that they use some non traditional ingredients like olive oil to help keep things on the healthy side.  Their vindaloo and korma were great.  One of my friends ordered a goat dish and loved it but I didn't get a taste.  Desserts were home made and excellent as well.  Be sure to get the home made pistachio ice cream!",

The hub and I really like Indian food, but often find places disappointing-too rich, lacking complex flavors, or simply not fresh. What a treat to find this place on Yelp - it was as good as one would expect from the reviews (even leftovers heated the next day). The dal is far more flavorful than in many places, using a few different legumes and interesting spices-not full of heavy cream, more a rich gravy consistency. The Bengan Bharta had the wonderful smoky quality of eggplant roasted first in a tandoor, then sauteed with some other tasty veg and spices; yum! The garlic naan was perfectly cooked, as was the less common gobhi (cauliflower) paratha. Vegetable samosas were flaky, with excellent filling and fresh chutneys on the side. Even desserts were delicious and cooked in house. Service by two friendly and welcoming brothers (owners) couldn't be better. The whole experience is like being invited in for a home-cooked meal. We can't wait to return!",

They took the time to explain about the papadum and the tamarind sauce and the green chutney.  I didn't have the heart to tell him that we are veteran indian food lovers.    We tried the beef samosas as an appetizer.  We got two of them that had a nice size to them and they were almost greaseless.  They were also full of meat.  I just wished that they had more aromatic herbs in them.  Maybe a touch more of cardamon.   Ordered the New India Gate biryani which has both lamb and chicken.  It was not greasy but the flavors were not as good as we expected.  We have had much better.  The portion was big for the price.  The texture of the rice was fine.   We also ordered chicken vindaloo which was delicious by my standards.  Had that nice vinegary taste that traditional vindaloo is supposed to have and had plenty of potato chunks to soak up that wonderful sauce.  I was super pleased with my selection. For dessert, I had Kheer and though the raisins and nuts were missing, I enjoyed it nonetheless.   The customer service is excellent.  Reason enough to go and be served good indian food.  They give a Yelp discount of which we took advantage.  I hear they have a buffet 7 days a week at a reasonable price.   Thanks for the great meal.",

We have been to hundreds over the years in many countries but not able to find too many in Arizona!   Ordered to go: Meat samosa - (accidentally gave us beef instead of chicken but it was better than most and have a great flavor on the outside which was a surprise) Tandoori wings - tender and so flavorful, better than most we have tried anywhere including the \"wing\" place! Mater paneer - (peas and cheese) mild, and it really was mild because I can't do spicy which eliminates a lot of places for me. Chicken tikka masala  (mild again I can't do spicy and it was) ... wow, tender chicken breast and flavored.  Yup, one of the best butter sauces I have ever tasted.  And I love that is was not loaded with veggies because I like to dip my naan in it! Basmati rice - perfectly cooked and tender. Regular naan - (I prefer a little chewy and bendable to pick up food) and it was awesome. So happy I tried this. Service by the way was amazing.  Can't wait to do this again!!!!!",

I ordered the chicken Tika Masala 5 stars I ordered it Indian hot it was divine.  The basmati rice was flaky and delicious.  The only odd thing is they charge for the rice ?  Never seen that before. The buttered Naan was made to perfection. Over all I wish I lived here I would be going all the time. Hopefully they will have a family member open up this restaurant in Texas!!!! Great job New IndianGate your a hidden gem !!! Sincerely Tony!!!",

    "text": "The food is mediocre here unfortunately. The Indian cuisine has been diluted with a heavy Mexican influence. We came for Sunday brunch and, being extremely familiar with and appreciative of Indian food, will not be back.   The palak paneer tasted almost exactly like a green enchilada sauce with a distinct flavor of Mexican chilies and corn flour. It's very weird to look at palak, knowing it to be clearly Indian, and then experiencing an entirely different country when you put it in your mouth.  The aloo gobi also lacked depth and tasted very Americanized. The other dishes on the buffet were average.   The lovely thing about this place is that the staff are incredibly sweet and considerate. I wish them continued success, especially if this is a family owned business. My advice would be to not forget your roots!",

He genuinely cares about you enjoying your meal, and will spend how ever much time you need to make sure you order the right dish(s) for you. Constant follow ups to see how the meal is going and for drink refills. Truly exceptional service.   I've had their saag paneer, chicken tikka, lamb korma, and lamb madras, all of which have been excellent. Their korma sauce could be the best that I've ever had.   This place has definitely become one of our favorites and would HIGHLY recommend to anyone interested. Due to the service and patient explanations, this would be a perfect place for a first time experience with Indian food. The excellent food makes it a great place for both inexperienced and experienced Indian food goers.",

The staff were very attentive, taking the time to explain the various dishes to us.  There were more than enough staff members making sure that everybody had plenty of drinks and anything else they needed, and as soon as we set an empty dish aside it was cleared off the table immediately high is unique nowadays.  And the food, oh God the food! It was almost a religious experience! We tried everything at the buffet, and I mean everything!  Each dish was flavored to perfection without being overly spiced, and by the time we walked out I had to loosen my belt.  It's now 6 hours later and I am still full.

    "text": "I was thrilled to find an Indian restaurant with such great reviews and had high hopes.   First off I noticed they had an Open Table option for reservations and wasn't sure how busy this was on weekends (figured why not because you usually get 100 points per reservation).   When we got to the restaurant no one is there to greet us and finally we were told to pick any seat. When our waiter came I asked if he could check us in for our reservation and he told us not to do reservations - frustrating.   Next our waiter asked if we wanted butter or garlic naan (it seemed like it was complimentary, but we later found out it was billed on the receipt). According to other reviewers papadam is complimentary, but never received that so maybe it's selective.   We ordered fish pakora which was probably the best of the group and had to ask for sauce to go with it. Not sure why it doesn't come at the same time as the meal.   We also ordered a paneer dish, a chickpea and chicken dish. The dishes were ok but nothing worth recommending or going back for (sadly I've had better out of the frozen aisle of Trader Joe's). The rice was mediocre and the paratha a huge disappointment. I'm used to the flaky almost croissant like ones and these were like a crisped up buttered tortilla (not great for the sauce I was hoping to soak up).   I look forward to good fresh hot naan. The problem here is the naan arrived 15 minutes before the food. So by the time the dishes with the sauce came it was cold and hard (not exactly what I was craving).  Service was a bit to be desired. After looking at the buffet (which sounds like a good idea for the price) we ended up ordering off the menu instead. Most of the items on the buffet looked like they had been sitting far too long and all the protein picked off by other patrons.  If you have a credit card that requires verification by chip and not swiping don't go here. It won't go through. We had to scramble to pay in cash unexpectedly. Receipts are not given automatically, and you have to ask for them, also it will just show what was ordered not paid, so don't expect to get anything officially especially if you need it for a business expense.   I really wanted to love this place, but not only do I have no desire to go back, I would sadly recommend going to Trader Joe's frozen aisle first.  Maybe it was an off day for this place, but I see no reason to go out of my way again for such a disappointing visit.",

A recent review by my fiancee of lunch options close to home yielded this result, so we decided to give it a try and we were glad we did.  We arrived just before noon on a Saturday and the restaurant was still fairly quite, however business picked up quite a bit while we were there. The dining area was clean, open, and the table settings were clearly above average for a lunch buffet. The staff were very friendly, prompt, an courteous. It was also obvious that some of the customers were regulars.  The buffet menu included an impressive variety of popular Indian dishes, including Tandoori Chicken, Goat Curry, Chicken Tikka Masala, Palak Paneer, and Green Bean and Potato Curry.  Freshly made Garlic Naan was delivered to our table, which was included with the meal. My fiancee enjoyed it so much she requested a second order.  The desserts included Mango Custard and Gulab Jamun.  Best of all, for me, was the self-serve Chai Tea dispenser. I was on my third cup by the time we had dessert and it was the perfect accompaniment.  The price for their lunch buffet can't be beat for what you get and we'll be sure to return.

    "text": "Before you read my review, you should know this about me:  1. I'm a southern Californian born in Taiwan. 2. I've lived in north Orange County all my life minus the four years I spent in UT for college. 3. I love to eat, and refuse to eat anything I don't think taste good.  REFUSE. 4. I don't mind spending money to eat well. 5. My parents owned two sandwich shops while I was growing up.  I worked there as a kid, through college and beyond, so I'm a big fan of mom and pop shops.  I wanted to love this place so badly. I'm visiting buddies in the area, and wanted on a rainy day (yes, in Arizona) for something with variety and spicy. Indian food should do it, right?  Imagine my surprise when I realize the banquet was $1 more than what was put on another Yelper (probably increased in the last year; it's now $9.99). Then it kind of just went down from here...  My issues and concerns:  1. Everything, and I mean everything was chicken minus one dish. OH dear. Other than the vegetarian dishes, of course. The spinach dish - I can't remember how to say or spell it - was so bland and WATERY.  So weird!  2. To placate to the masses, they \"dumbed down\" their food. Indian food is SUPPOSED o be spicy and flavorful.  None of the dishes - and I had everything but three at the buffet - were either.  It was horridly disappointing.  Having said that...  3. The service was impeccable. I mean, IMPECCABLE. I don't remember the last time I was treated with such respect and gotten so much attention (not annoying either) at a restaurant.  I was really, REALLY impressed since this is somewhat unusual at Indian restaurants I've experienced in CA.  4.  Lots of parking - I mean it. It's in the same shopping center as lots of stores but there is a TON of parking - always love this for this southern Californian.  It's not BAD food. It's just not GOOD food. And if someone was to ask me to go to this place and paid for my ticket, I'd go again.  In fact, I would love to try them at dinner a la carte. I'd bet it's a lot better.",

    "text": "First visit here and I wanted to be impressed because of the reviews.  First let me reiterate as others have the service and attentiveness of staff is impressive.  I am not sure if they were having a bad cooking day or the food prepped is normally made as described.  The galub jamun was very very dense, and not light inside at all. It was served cold instead of hot. Hot vs cold is a simple preference. The kheer was almost like a water consistency and had no tapioca and specks of rice here and there. The mango custard had good flavor and had a nice amount of mango pieces in it. The desserts are about 50% of why I like an Indian buffet. So this was extremely disappointing to say the least.   The tamarind chutney was excellent.  The tandoori chicken was very dry, one of the first times I have encountered this. Usually it is extremely moist and juicy with rich flavor depth. The onions with it were fantastic in flavor though.   I tried to enjoy the goat curry but I kept finding chips of bones throughout the gravy. If there is one thing I abhor it is having to reach into my mouth at a meal to pull out bad pieces of food or bone fragments. It wasn't just once but at least 3 times.  The chicken dishes were decent in flavor but again the sauces were a bit runny. The meat was tender.  The garlic naan bread was perfectly done, very light in texture.  The rice was pretty good. Overall the buffet price point reflects the product line they are able to offer. A restaurant isn't going to serve you items which are a huge profit loss because they would soon be out of business.",

I was insistent on using the 20% off check-in coupon for lunch one day, but the server very politely explained that it was the same price (if not cheaper) to do the lunch buffet, and you got so much more! He was so nice, even though he probably thought I was a moron who couldn't do simple math. The buffet ended up being delicious and I was able to try things I wouldn't have ordered off the full menu. And the restaurant is super clean! I'll definitely be going back next time I'm in town!",

    "text": "Ray and Rural is quite the foodie intersection. I met up with some friends here on an early Saturday afternoon for their lunch buffet, which is $9.95. We chose garlic naan vs plain because garlic is life. They have a lot of dishes to choose from, including several vegetarian and vegan options. I went with white rice, pulao rice, chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala, chicken tandoori, saag paneer, mushroom curry, aloo vada (potato balls), and aloo gobi. Their sauces included mint chutney, tamarind, and a hot red, which I mixed together. All was good, and I didn't even try everything, like the lamb or goat curry (a bit too strong for my liking). Their desserts included carrot halwa, rice pudding, gulab jamun, and mango custard which looked like nacho cheese! Oh it threw me off but it was delicious, and they only serve it on the weekends. We also got some chai which was a nice way to end our meal.   Service was friendly and attentive, our plates were cleared away in a timely manner and waters refilled. The restaurant is spacious and they do takeout orders as well. There are some Yelp deals for that and for ordering entrees, if you're not interested in the buffet. Overall, spice level was medium but I appreciated their hot sauce at the end, and the cucumber and lettuce to cool down. Lots of contenders for top Indian restaurants and this (halal) spot is up there.",

The menu had a lot of options for appetizers, entrees, drinks, desserts and they had a good beer selection too. We ordered the veggie appetizer sampler, 3 entrees, garlic and plain naan, and rice. (With 2 entrees they give you rice). Food came out on time and delicious. Everyone who helped us was nice and we always had our waters refilled. We needed something to cool down the spice so my mom ordered a mango lassi. I normally wouldn't be able to drink it because I have a dairy allergy but our server, Gopi, was very accommodating and said they could try to make one with coconut milk for me but it was something they've never done. The mango lassi with coconut milk was delicious!!! Not as sweet as a traditional one but still so yummy!!! He also let me know right off the bat what desserts were dairy based and which ones had a tolerable amount. I ended up ordering the Gulab Joman. Gopi was so awesome!!! he was probably the friendliest and caring server I've had. The food was good, but the service is amazing and will be back because of it. Check this place out!",

Little did I know they offer $8 all you can eat buffet & the store location is where iSushi was at before they closed down (sniff sniff...).   When the door was opened, I can smell curry at every corner of the restaurant. Most of the tables are full and majority of the clients are Indians. That is usually a sign that their food is super authentic. Since I don't know much about Indian food, I basically took a little bit of different curry to try out. Wow it was absolutely delicious. Each table also comes with either plain or garlic bread. I dipped it into the curry sauce and it was so heavenly. By the time I was on my 2nd plate, I was already full.   Food is delicious & their service is great. I'll most definitely come back here again.   P.S. if you check in at this place, they will give you 10% discount.",

    "text": "I recently stopped by New India Gate for their weekend lunch buffet, and was incredibly impressed. As a novice to Indian Food, I was a bit apprehensive that the buffet might be too spicy for my taste. I expressed my concerns to the waitress, and the manager (possibly the owner) ended up walking us through the entire buffet, dish-by-dish, explaining the ingredients in each dish, what to expect from a heat perspective and how to adjust the heat on-the-fly if it is too spicy. I'm not sure I've ever had a restaurant provide such a careful, detailed explanation of their food, and I was thoroughly impressed with their friendliness and desire to make sure I felt confident in making selections.  In terms of the quality of the food, I can't say I'm an expert at evaluating Indian food, but everything tasted really fresh and high quality, and they had a solid selection of vegetarian dishes on the buffet as well. I am a meat-eater, but the vegetarian curry was actually my favorite dish! Plus, if you go on the weekend they have an amazing mango pudding on the buffet (served Saturday and Sunday only)!  I'll absolutely dine at New India Gate again in the future!",

I read the Yelp reviews on here and decided this is totally happening. I met the brothers who own this wonderful place and they were so friendly and helpful. The place is clean and spacious, to make room for the many people who will be excited to eat here as I was.    Chicken vindaloo- Yes, it's banging! I ordered it Indian spicy because I appreciate the heat. This was the freshest homemade chicken vindaloo I've ever had, and I frequently order this at any Indian restaurant I try.   Lunch: What a great variety and selection in their buffet! Everything I ate in the buffet was flavor heaven! I'm going to dream about their tiki masala until I can have it again. Curry chicken was delicious, mushroom matter was saucy, perfect over rice. They have pickled lemons!  It's another favorite of mine that not many Indian restaurants have out here and I enjoy it. I can already tell I'm going to live at this place. You'll easily become a regular here because everything about this place is full of joy.   I was told these were mom's recipes and man do they have a great mom! Their mom gave them a lifetime of good food! Holy cow.  I'm going to try everything on their menu. You definitely need to come here or you're missing out.",

Two knowledgable and loquacious brothers run the place.  They seat, take orders, bus tables, serve the food and answer every question about the eclectic menu that is thrown at them. The recipes, however, are the fathers.   We decided to sample menu items other than the ubiquitous chicken tikka masala. We started of with the beef samosas. I had never seen the beef variety before.  All I can say is \"WOW!\"  Served with mint and tamarin chutney, the     delicately spiced ground beef was seasoned perfectly.  I would have  been satisfied to end the meal right then and there.     Next was the Fish Pakora, they were tasty and made with moist white fish.  Nothing mind blowing.  For the main meals we ordered \"Indian Hot\" spice level.   We ordered: Mushroom Matter (mushroom, tomato, green peas and spices),  Chana Masala (garbanzo beans and masala sauce), and Karahi Shrimp (ginger, tomoto, onion, bell pepper served in an Indian copper pan). I was craving super hot but I would equate it to a medium at a Thai restaurant.  The food paired really well with the fresh soft garlic naan.  I am definitely returning and bringing friends!",

I can be picky about kofta but this one is so good, it's slightly less spicy than the tikka masala but in a good way.  Also both of those orders came with a side of white rice so I got 2 containers of rice which was more than enough.   I love this place and think it's a little less expensive than most other Indian restaurants I go to in Tempe.",

This place deserves its 5 stars.  Perhaps the friendliest service of the many Indian joints in the Valley.  After a few years hiatus, they're back, and I'm very glad that they are.    I've been to approximately 10 different Indian lunch buffets in the Valley and I'm going to go out on a limb and say that, on the whole, this is the best.  From variety to quality, it hits all the right notes.  The friendly staff adds that much more to the experience.    I don't mind places that have bone-in chicken in their curries, but bonus points to this place for using boneless.  Their chicken tikka masala is excellent, as is their garlic naan.  I'm a sucker for kheer and their's is particularly good.  There's a great mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, complimentary chai masala also helps.  Until I find something better, this is my go-to Indian in the Valley.",

    "text": "Very happy that Yelp guided me to this establishment.  My GF and I are ethnic food junkies and have been pretty disappointed with the Indian offerings in the valley.  We have our favorite spots in the cities we travel to, but rarely eat Indian in the valley as mediocrity plagues this cadre of restauranteurs.   This spot appeared as a hot and new listing on Yelp, with 5 stars, but only 40 reviews.  Low rating always leave me feeling a bit skeptical, but what the hell, we had nothing to lose.   The restaurant had a relatively modern and minimalistic, yet warm feel.   One of the sons of the owner and chef greeted and sat us.  He was extremely personable and took a interest in our 17 month old.  He helped us review the menu and gave his recommendations.  He also told us that if we have some favorite dishes that weren't on the menu, to just ask, as his father had been a chef for many years.  We took the the challenge and ordered the Gobi Manchurian (fried cauliflower entree).  Plus we ordered several other entrees as we like to bring Indian food home as it usually makes great leftovers.  We ordered the lamb madras, an interesting chicken dish that incorporated egg in the sauce, and yet another item not on the menu, chili chicken.  We customized our order of naan, adding chilies and garlic.  Everything tasted great and to our surprise, the non menu items were our favorite.  The Gobi Manchurian rocked.  It was better than any other I have had.   It is family owned and got to meet the two brothers/ sons of the owner.  Both incredibly personable.   We are very excited to return and even more excited about eating the leftovers today.",

We felt like we were invited into a family home for dinner rather than a run of the mill restaurant. The young man (owner's son) who was there told us all the ingredients are sourced fresh and locally, and that they are all family recipes. I hate when people say that and you can taste a disgusting frozen, month old mess. Not the case at all here; EVERYTHING was tried tasted like it was made on the spot. We had the chicken tika masala, lamb vindaloo, samosas, a delicious Indian beer (Kingfisher), and the best damn pistachio dessert I have ever had. I HIGHLY recommend giving this new joint a shot; I hope they stay in business for years to come.",

They make you feel like you're an old friend and were always available for drink refills or for extra mint chutney!  We ordered a variety of food. We started with the vegetable snack plate that had a variety of deep fried yummy snacks. Very good and nicely seasoned. The goat curry is delicious. The goat meat is so tender and the sauce is yummy. We ordered the basmati rice which was light and fluffy. The shrimp korma.... I will sing the praises of this dish! The shrimp were fork tender and the gravy is the ultimate comfort food! Order the garlic naan so you can soak up all the goodness with it!  We were given a sample of the sweet mango lassi. It was thick and creamy. I could have downed a gallon of the stuff easy!  We opted for some dessert to round out our meal. We ordered the gulab jamun and the pistachio kulfi. The gulab jamun was good. A little more dense than I like. But the kulfi.... wow! It was so delicious! You HAVE to try it! We will definitely be back to try more of their food!",

The dishes that they chose for the buffet were all equally popular, and delicious.  The Naan was perfect, with the garlic being our favorite. The price, service, and taste truly earn New India Gate 5 stars.",

    "text": "Super impressed with this find. Weekend buffet exceeded my expectations! Our \"go to\" spot has been cutting back on quality for some time now and I thought it was time to try some place new. So glad I did. Star of the buffet was the paneer tikka masala. Many layers of spices, butter/ghee, and tomato goodness. The owner's son (I believe) frequently checked on us, refilling our drinks and asking how we liked it. I gushed over the tikka and he told me everything is homemade there, even the sauces they offer - Chutneys.  You can tell! The paneer cheese had a satisfying chew and creaminess. How is this found on a buffet?? I was impressed. Not only with the buffet spread but the level of care, sincerity and obvious personal investment shown for the restaurant's success. veg samosas also offered and were quite crispy and delicious, which is not what I'm accustomed to at \"other\" buffets. Fried food is usually soggy unless you get it within 30 minutes or so of coming out. I appreciate that both vegetarian and meat options were available and oh, the naan they brought was pretty darn good. Also, chai tea at the buffet. You sweeten yourself. Loved! This is our new place for great Indian food and service :)",

Finding out that this little gem is close by, we're on our way. Totally nondescript surroundings outside and in. But that warm n fuzzy feeling of truly being welcomed hit before the front door shut behind us. I could do without the constant reminder of \"front door open\" with every entry/exit. We unfortunately chose the table right by that annoying little speaker.  I've got a tool that can quickly put an end to that. It's spotless clean & didn't smell like feet, as curry can sneak up on you like that. The tables are dressed with nice linens. The few selections were typical and our choice of nan was given and brought warm & fresh quickly. We tried everything and it was all mmmmm tasty. A little mango chutney would've been good but I managed to inhale 2.5 plates.  But these guys running this place are genuinely friendly, helpful and deserving of a fat tip.  All in all, in my top 5 restaurants when I want to get my Indian fix",

Chatted with the two sons while the food was prepared and they are incredibly knowledgable and passionate about what they do. These are all family recipes and the process they use to prepare everything is as caring as it gets. The chicken was perfectly marinaded and cooked - great hint of lemon from the marinating process and the marinade was tasty and not overbearing. The korma was creamy and flavourful and the lamb was as tender as it gets. Keema naan was a great accompaniment. I will definitely be going back and I advise anyone to give this place a try.

The buffet had a good mix of vegetable, fried, and meat dishes. Dishes today included saag paneer, chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, and biriyani. My favorites were the fish curry and the malai kofta (Vegetable fritters in curry sauce).   Dessert consisted of gulab jamun, kheer, fresh watermelon, and carrot halwa. The dishes all tasted pretty good, no complaints on my end! The spice level was just right for a buffet. Not too mild but with a slight kick to make it about a low to medium level for me.  Service was friendly and attentive. In addition to the buffet items they will bring fresh naan to your table which was plentiful and refilled as needed.  My favorite Indian buffet is still Chutney's but New India Gate is cheaper and also has a good variety so it is a close second! This is a great option for lunch and I'll definitely be back again.",

    "text": "As a huge fan of Indian buffets for over the last twenty two years, I've tried quite a few in the east valley, and in that time, I long considered Delhi Palace over in Tempe as the gold standard.  After multiple trips to New India Gate, they have officially taken the crown away from Delhi Palace as my all-time favorite!  The buffet is fully packed with tasty offerings which, once the craving hits, has me coming back just about every couple of weeks.  At $9.95 for the weekend buffet, I truly feel that for the quality and quantity of food that they offer, you get more than your moneys worth.  The Chicken Tikka Masala is absolutely scrumptious every single time that I visit this establishment, along with the Tandori Chicken, tender and juicy with just the right amount of spice to it, the Vegetable Samosas, a crispy, flaky pastry filled with spiced up potatoes and veggies, and their rice as the base, which is cooked to perfection every time I visit.  The garlic naan has just the right amount texture and flavor to sop up alll of those incredible sauces on your plate to create the perfect bite.  These are just a few of the many delicious choices that keep me coming back for more!  Lastly, the dessert selection is the perfect finishing acts to send your taste buds into the stratosphere.  The Kheer is without a doubt, the best version of rice pudding that I've ever had.  That along with the Golab Jaman, little balls of milky goodness, various spices and sugar syrup just add to the symphony of flavors that this fine place offers.  Finally, the Gajar Halwa, their take on a sweet carrot dessert, which includes nuts and raisins, is just another home run that makes my mouth water just thinking about it!  Bottom line - if you've never gone outside the box and experimented with this type of food, the buffet at New India Gate is the perfect place to give your taste buds something new that they'll thank you for later.  If you've already tried out Indian food and are a fan of this type of cuisine, come to this place and see what all of the terrific reviews are about!  The family which owns the place truly show their love for the food that they're putting out for the masses and are extremely generous and personable.  Keep up the high standard that you've already set New India Gate, it's certainly working on yours truly!",

I do not hand out reviews and compliments unless one is well deserved, good or bad.   So, here we go!  The immediate engagement by the owners was perfect. They had and have no issue with sharing what is in, and how their food is prepared. I love the fact that they procure their poultry and (fresh) vegetables from local farms here in Arizona. My girlfriend is celiac and has to have a strict gluten free diet. We continually search for restaurants that are GF friendly. This is home. On our first visit, I was so impressed with how patient and honest they were. I mean, we must have talked for about 30 minutes (before we ordered), as to what is safe and what to avoid and how they handle the food, and so on...every detail explained.  The table linens are fresh and clean. No stains! Glasses, spotless! The silverware, no doubt, clean. Presentation of the tables have a classy charm, too. Whether you are single or on a date, married, or have a big family, New India Gate makes you feel welcomed and important. If you get the opportunity to meet Manuel, you will feel like he is their speciffically only, for you. He is a True gentlemen and very attentive. He will remember your name and say hello to you everytime. His service is excellent!  The food, simply stated; INCREDIBLE!!! I have my favorites....I won't share them. You will have to discover yours, on your own.  New India Gate is one of Chandlers most prized treasures in the city. You will not be dissapointed.   Hope this review makes you want to dine there....I am so glad we found this place. Enjoy and bon appetit!",

The three gentleman that were working that night all were attentive. I was quickly greeted and water brought to me. I placed all my order which included veggie samosa, chicken Marsala, garlic naan, and rice pudding. The samosa was great, just like most samosas. Their chicks. Marsala or butter chicken was also great. The food wasn't anything different than your good/great Indian food. It's what I would of expected. However what makes this place a 5 star is definitely their customer service. Also, hearing the conversation from another table, it seems like their lunch buffet is very popular and attracts more of the crowd. Overall, a great experience on a local place.",

I ordered togo chicken tikka masala and an order of garlic naan-bread (no rice, still doing no or low carb!) As far as spice goes they have a variety of them, but this time I opted for Indian medium (I really thought my head was going to explode because I wanted something between medium and hot, but either I'm getting used to it, it's 108F outside, or I'm not certain it was just that hot!)  The chicken tikka masala was fantastic, so much so I could have drank the gravy it's in! The garlic non-was a little less impressive but sure did make it fun soaking up the gravy I didn't drink (see attached picture).  I'm not certain when I'll be in the greater Chandler area again, but if I am and I'm in the mood this will definitely be my Indian goto spot. You've got to like a place that's only five months old but the love and care they show really comes through in the cleanliness of the restaurant as well as the food.  Here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Yes  Return? Yes  Advocate? Yes",

Really great tasting sauces/gravies with all the items we had, but the portions were rather small for the price paid ($12-$16 per item) for a smallish styrofoam pot, with maybe 1 WE of sauce and meat. Our shrimp dish had only about 6 shrimp. The sauces were rather watery, a bit thin in my opinion. The saag paneer was very tasty though.  Want to give 3.5, but will go with 4 instead of 3 as the taste was good, but the value was not. Will have to try out the buffet for lunch in the future.",

It was the best of times and it was the mediocre, luke warmest of times and yet I regret never trying the dessert when it was offered to me. I would really give them a 3.5 but I'm rounding up to four stars because of the customer service. Anyway, the glutton in me is constantly on the lookout for buffets so when I found this gem about 15 minutes from my job I decided to take a chance. I had only had Indian food once before from a mall food court place and I barely remember anything about it. The first time I came here, about a month ago, I came on a good day. The service was really attentive and everyone was super friendly which was constant - they have great customer service. I liked that it was a serve yourself lunch buffet and I think my total bill, with tip, came to $14 or so. They offer you a choice of regular nan or garlic nan when you are first seated. I tried a little bit of everything but fell in love with the curry chicken but the tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, and biriyani are good too. I also tried the mango lassi and it was everything. If you like mango and you like yogurt and you like creamy drinks, order a mango lassi. I was a little pressed for time so I declined having any dessert but I didn't see where the dessert was anywhere in the buffet (it's a small buffet) so I don't even know what the options were. I came back a week later and had a totally different experience. I had been thinking about New India Gate since I left, seriously. I think I came after a large group because they were pretty much cleaned out. The buffet needed to be replenished badly, there was no chicken in the chicken curry and everything else was slim pickings and only slightly warm at that. I didn't even eat my tandoori chicken because it was only a notch above cold to the touch - completely different experience than my first time, sadly. Also, no one ever asked me what I wanted to drink; I had to flag someone down to order my mango lassi which was mostly ice this time, to my disappointment. I also wasn't asked if I wanted dessert and again, since I didn't know where the dessert was, I just left without I haven't been back since then because I quickly got over my Indian food kick after that last time. I'll definitely be back but it'll be a while, I'm sure they will redeem themselves.",

When it comes to the food, the blends of spices and flavors are exactly on point and balanced. The lamb is tender, the chicken is perfectly cooked, etc. If you are new to Indian food or have had previous bad experiences at other places, I recommend you give this place a try. They have the patience, knowledge, and food quality to make solid recommendations and give you the best possible experience.",

Food: I like the food, it's not too spicy and resembles home made Indian food to some extent. The have a decent selection of veg and non-veg curries. I also like the naan here, it's much better than most other Indian restaurants I've been to where they make it too thick and don't bake it properly.     Service: The service is really good and everyone here is very friendly and welcoming to the customers  Ambience: Again, no disappointments here.

Will have to try for dinner to explore to explore some of the lamb options.  Owner brought out a sample of their home made ice cream with some pistachios on top which hit the spot.   Currently they are awaiting their liquor license but hopeful they will stock some local craft brew options like Santan Devil Ale which would go great with a spicy vindaloo.",

Unlike other Indian restaurants I've visited, New India Gate allows you to control the heat level on EVERY dish. This is wonderful, because I can't handle the heat and haven't been able to try dishes I wished I could! The most amazing part is my 5yo ordered goat, and LOVED IT! He hates every food his parents suggest, so I'm still amazed. He told us \"this place got five stars, but it should've gotten SIX!\" Plus, my other child kept murmuring \"this is delicious\" as he ate his chicken dish. I love this place, every part of it. The dad was cooking with mom, and the two brothers were servers. A+  (I was surprised to see any negative reviews, so went to read them. Every single one was a glowing recommendation - I'm pretty sure these guys wrote 5 star reviews, but didn't know to (or forgot) to choose how many stars to rate it! That means 100% of these reviews are positive!!!)",

    "text": "To get straight to the point, I've eaten at maybe a dozen different Indian restaurants around Phoenix (usually take-out for dinner), and I've found this to be my overall favorite. It's hard to explain exactly why, but I simply prefer the flavors/spices here better than the other places. The only thing I don't like is that it is a bit on the pricey side (for dinner) and the portions are somewhat smaller than many of the other restaurants. Nevertheless, I usually end up making the trek out here from downtown whenever we're in the mood for Indian food.",

We sat at the car for a glass of wine while they prepared the food.  The bartender was super friendly and engaged in great conversation.  They brought us samples of custard and fruit dishes while we waited.   We will definitely be back for the food and for Gopi.  It was great talking with the staff there!",

I went for dinner the first time and then back twice since for the lunch buffet. All three were great. The buffet had some different dishes than other Indian restaurants than I've been to and the dishes weren't the same the two times I went which I love. To me that's part of what I love about buffets is getting to try different foods without having to order a whole meal of it. Each time they had some staples like chicken tikka which is my go to Indian meal. Love it. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for good Indian food and friendly staff. Enjoy",
