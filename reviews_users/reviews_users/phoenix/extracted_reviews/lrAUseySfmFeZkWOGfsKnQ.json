Grease kept falling out of my mouth every time I took a bite and that pretty much ruined the experience for me here.",

Your choices are either steak or chicken, and each taco just has cheese and the meat on it. Then you can top it with choices of a hot red sauce, a green sauce, lettuce, pico de gallo, and limes.  They are a very reasonable price and very delicious! I really enjoyed them and would definitely go back when I'm in the area.",

The only option for my vegetarian daughter was a quesadilla, which was two small tortillas with cheese in the middle for $2.65. The quesadilla looked like it was pressed and so as it was flattened the cheese that spilled out became crispy. I ordered tacos, and while they were larger than the typical street taco, it was nothing spectacular. The chicken was bland and I found a few pieces of chicken bone in my tacos.  The tacos are almost $3 each and chips have to be purchased separately for $3.50.",

They ask you to sign up for their rewards program and something about a free taco when you do, it's also on yelp. Yesterday I went and 3 people were working, none of them greeted and when I went to order, they asked what do you want? Normally the old manager was super polite and as anyone came in she would say, WELCOME TO WADAA TACOS! with a smile. The new mgr barely uttered a word while we were there and it looked like all 3 of them workers hardly said one word to each other in the back. It was like they did not want to be there, awkward. My 5 year old even asked where the nice lady was. Usually we see them grilling our taco meat fresh, this time we seen them scoop it out of a metal container and spoon it onto semi cold corn tortillas. By the time we got our tacos, it was soaked more than normal in fats and looked like it was just carelessly thrown together. While we were there two guys came in, no one said one word to them. It was odd considering the old manager (either native or Mexican lady short with dark hair) would always beam with a smile and greet every single customer. They stood around for a bit and when no one finally said anything to them, they just walked out. I politely asked if the point system works because I sighed up a few weeks ago and received no text. The cashiers response, I don't know, I don't deal with that part *walks off*. The new mgr saw me asking and offered no help. A few minutes later she leaves carrying  her belongings looking unhappy. This may not be a big deal, but the reason I was drawn to this place was the freshly grilled meat and the inviting atmosphere. Looks like the old mgr was much nicer that even a 5 year old noticed. Pretty sure we won't be back. Prices raised  as well. $3 tacos now. Used to be $2, then went to $2.55.t",

My husband suggested fast food, which I wasn't keen on since it was so late and I intended to go to bed soon after we got home. This prompted me to head to trusty Yelp and try to find something better and still open. I'm so glad I checked it out b/c I found Wadaa Street Tacos and it happened to be just off the freeway on our way home. It had the best reviews of anything open at nearly 11p on a Monday night and we decided to try it.   WOW! We were not disappointed! The menu is super simple w/only tacos, a quesadilla and beverages. This made the ordering process very easy and our food was ready quickly as well. I got the Carne Asada tacos on corn tortillas and topped them w/all the salsas, onions, and pico de gallo they had which made my taco taste so good and fresh! I was happily surprised that regular sized corn tortillas were used b/c I was expecting the small corn tortillas. I was glad I had ordered two instead of three as I was barely able to make it past one and a half when my husband helped me out and finished the rest. He ordered the Pollo tacos on flour tortillas and was equally pleased with his meal! He even complimented me on having found this place so quickly on our way home! I also picked up a pack of small flour tortillas since we were running low at home and the were delicious warmed up with a little bit of butter!   The interior is clean, basic, and well decorated w/awards and community photos.  Being right off the freeway makes it a good place to stop off and grab a quick bite before you head back on the road!  Since this place is on our way to/from home, I know we'll definitely be coming here again and can't wait!",

I work off of a budget and was able to negotiate with Miguel to get the price I needed. We have to pay vendors with a company check, and although Wadaa Tacos typically uses an app to receive payment, Miguel was flexible and trusting of me to get the check in.   On the day of the event two men came out to work the cart. They arrived and were set up with plenty of time. The men were very kind and professional. My director and I were very impressed with the taco cart and all of the food and salsa they provided. Plus, our residents LOVED the tacos.   I highly recommend Wadaa Tacos because of their professionalism, trustworthiness, flexibility, and amazing tacos! We will be keeping them in mind for future events.",

But that being said, the tacos here are actually quite yummy.  There are only two types of tacos to choose from: beef or chicken. I love a place that keep things simple. Each taco is priced at $3 a piece. Order your taco, get your taco, and dress it up however you'd like at the salsa bar. I came here during daytime and the toppings from the salsa bar was empty and looking like it was from last night which was kind of a turn off... But then again this place is pretty divey so I wasn't exactly expecting much.  Overall, I think the tacos speak for themselves. Simple, tasty, A-okay!",

Let's start with the fact that just because you have a open window store front on a street doesn't give you the right to label you're tacos \"street tacos.\" Let's leave that honor to the proper establishments like King Taco in Los Angeles.   Moreover, a traditional \"street taco\" has the basics starting with and most importantly...A CORN TORTILLA, NOT FLOWER! Now if you're trying to have the basic \"street taco\" then you missed the point by just offering asada y polo. Maybe substitute your chopped cabbage, with some cilantro. Try substituting your liquid green paste with real avocado guacamole. Instead of generic store bought pico de gallo, maybe serve diced white onions. And last but not least, maybe substitute your ground red chile with water for some actual flavorful salsa.  I would like to note that I have never given a bad review in Yelp, but these tacos reminded me of eating a Taco Bell taco...only worse.  Oh, and I believe it is state law to offer your customers a receipt and not tell them that you can't or to come back in an hour, just saying.",

Freaking kidding me.. can hardly find my meats on my extra small size quesadilla, tortilla texture on tacos that I ordered like old and left open in the fridge! Corn that i order looks un appetizing taste like left over and just reheated in microwave! They serve it to me stocks in top of each plates so my food was touching the bottom of the plate! So nasty!

Also throw some of that guacamole sauce... These tacos change Mexican food for you. Nothing touches how good these are and I've had a a lot of Mexican food in my lifetime. Fresh, hot, and fast! The customer service is also amazing for how busy they are at certain parts of the night. One time I came and they were closing down and they gave us two free taco cards for each of us. So 6 free total! That's amazing if you ask me! All I can say is if you're around this area and you are intoxicated or not you should try this amazing place.",

The meat is marinaded beautifully so the flavors are intense and satisfying. And they are only $2 each! Incredible bargain! Cheese is an extra buck. You really will be blown away by something so tasty being so inexpensive!  It isn't advertised but they will also make you a quesadilla for the same price as a taco, and I find them a bit more filling! So if you want to get something a little bigger for the same price try one out!  You really can't beat this deal in oldtown and they are superb!",

Online menu description doesn't say how many on the plate, so one would assume it would be what the image indicates if not otherwise specified. Ordered corn tortillas for the tacos. Ordered cheese for the tacos. Received one taco with only steak and cheese, not even the standard pico. Corn tortilla was clearly a yellow corn tortilla from a bag like you get at the grocery store. Not even remotely close to street taco tortillas (which are not dyed yellow btw and about half the size). It was cold and hard and the meat tough, way over cooked, and was barely warm. Worst tacos ever. $20 for 2 inedible tacos, a horchata (also awful), and a limeade (tolerable). Will not order from them again. So many other places that actually make AUTHENTIC street tacos that are hot, fresh, use fresh street taco style tortillas, and always come topped with fresh pico. Horrible experience. Highly advise you to save your money and go somewhere else.  Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad.",

I love the steak tacos. But the chicken is just as good. Dress the tacos up however you want. The red and green sauce is amazing!!! I like my tacos spicy so it definitely hits the spot.

The best thing about the restaurant is that they grill everything on real wood chunk charcoal, which imparts such a fantastic smoky flavor to the meat. Meat is well seasoned and marinaded and I've never been disappointed. Salsa variety is good, but I'd love to see a chipotle or smoker option than either the verde or the nuclear red.",

The menu was underwhelming but whatevs...keep it small and do it well, right? We could dig it. When we got our food it was cold, the cheese wasn't melted on our quesadillas, and they gave my husband chicken when he ordered steak. They literally have two meat choices so it shouldn't be hard to mix up and the place was dead. He went back right away and the lady (she seemed like the owner) argued with him about it.  She said that she had our receipt in front of her and she gave us food based off the receipt. She was talking over him when he tried to explain that they must've keyed it in wrong. I totally get it if people return food after they had a bite, but he literally took it right back and she was incredibly rude. The other party at our table could relate because apparently they didn't give them cheese OR grilled onions (which they charge an extra dollar for) on their tacos. But I guess they didn't get yelled at. WTF. Don't waste your money or your time.",

When I walked in the atmosphere was great with a few large tables that would fit about 8 people each with one of those tables completely full as well as the outside dining full as well. So far it looked very promising. There is also a huge salsa bar with quite a few options. Once I got to the counter to order however my level of awesome decreased right away. There was no greeting, just a minimal what do you want to order monotone question from the guy at the register. No smile. No communication. I asked a few questions since I'd never been here and again it was we have this etc... I asked what he thought the favorites of regulars were and with a blank look said nothing really. We have chicken or steak soooo. I was a bit taken back, but whatever. My order was quick and came out perfect. It's basically the meat and cheese if you'd like and you can add your own salsa. The price was pretty decent and I loved the fact that the check in gave you a free taco with purchase. I'd be back again and again for the food, but the service needs some help and maybe a smile",

We saw that YELP was offering a \"$27 for $33\" YELP Deal, so we bought it (sort of like a GROUPON deal). After reading many good reviews, we decided to give it a try. We got there and placed our order. The young lady behind the counter didn't know what deal we were talking about. We were about to leave and asked them to call someone who knew about this deal. We just told her let us know when we can come back and redeem our purchase. She called the owner. He came over really fast, and TOOK CARE OF IT and US!!! It was sooo GOOD!!! THAT Red Salsa tho... Wow!!! We told them we were craving so.e good street tacos like in Yuma, then the owner told us they were from San Luis. That's why they were so good. If you are on this side of town... STOP BY. I Highly recommend it. We definitely will be returning. Thank you Miguel and Thank the Ladies who helped us.   We ordered:  Carne Asada Quesadilla 3 Carne asada taco w/corn tortillas 3 carne asada tacos w/flour tortillas Al Pastor Taco 1 cookie  Mexican Coke Chips salsa Street Elote",

They don't actually make you tacos, they just throw all the ingredients of tacos in a styrofoam container and make you build it yourself. If that wasn't annoying enough, every single time they literally just dump everything in there carelessly and basically give you a taco salad.   Not like this happens once, it's happened almost every time I've come.   The store is always trashed and nasty. Food pieces everywhere. Employees seem annoyed your there. Horchata tastes like shit, they served me old and rotten horchata twice.   Never ever again.",

The tacos are tasty and I can easily eat 4 or 5 for lunch. It's truly just a hole in the wall, and there is no place to sit, so be prepared to find a spot on the sidewalk or take your food somewhere else.  Oh, and don't get the red sauce on your fingers and then rub your eye or you'll be looking for an eyewash station pretty fast, LOL.  P.S. I'll bet these tacos taste even better after a night out at the clubs in the area!",

Tasty and not very greasy. The pollo and carne asada both were pretty bland. I liked their avacado sayce and the lady liked the jalapenos from the salsa bar that were soaked in soy sauce. Not the worst place to eat but definitely nothing to get excited about or go out of your way for. I make better food myself IMHO. ",

So he screwed up my order, which is impressive because they only have steak, chicken, or pork tacos with corn or flour tortillas. When I got my steak tacos with corn tortillas and explained that I ordered the flour tortillas, he said without a beat \" no, no man you ordered corn\". To which I replied \"not in 42 years\". And then he told me, I kid you not...\"no, just a few minutes ago\". The Good: The chips and salsa are $4.75 but totally worth it. They even give you a nice 8 ounce container, so there is plenty of salsa to take home and plenty of chips left in the bag they give you. The tacos were yummy if you customize them at the salsa bar which was jammin.",

Only chicken or steak tacos and that's fine-I don't need a damn quesarito with a bunch of processed bullshit in it!   Service is great-these guys are literally shoulder to shoulder in a couple hundred square feet of space busting their asses off serving a bunch of drunk assholes, and they always do it with a smile on their face. There's always a line, but it moves FAST. These guys definitely know how to hustle.   $3 a taco and they have a full section of sauces, salsas, and other add-ons off to the side.

So other then that, I would go definitely considering coming back to Wadaa when the craving for street tacos is strong!",

Its A small shop with self serve Pico Dr Gallo which was delicious and spicy, limes, and salsa. My only complaint is they only offered flour tortillas from what I saw. Either that or I got it as default. A corn tortilla would have earned this place 5 stars! Delicious carne asada made right behind the cashier over a wood fire, doesn't get,more authentic then that... If it wasn't for that flour tortilla...... I think I might hit it back up and bring,my own corn! Definatly hit it up for a late night bite! Totally worth it!!!  *** update *** apparently seen in their update they do sell corn tortillas!!! That's all I was missing to have one of the best street tacos in East valley area! Congrats man...

There's street tacos and then there's the ones from this location. I seriously need them each week. That's not a joke. I wish Miguel made his pico for sale because I would use it at home. Yes. It's that good.  The chicken and steak tacos are some of the best I have had in the valley. Gabriella (one of the awesome people who work there) told me that they marinate the meat to make sure it's as tasty as possible.  When you drive by them, no matter the time of day, there are always people in line. That says a lot when you look around and see who their neighbors are in the area who also have tacos on their menus.",

For those of you that are wondering these are most definitely authentic street tacos similar to the ones that I have had in Mexico. The beauty lies in the simplicity in their menu as the only two offerings are either chicken or steak tacos. They are only $3 each which is a phenomenal deal as long as you don't mind how there is no place to sit down with chairs and tables.  The location can be good or bad depending on the circumstances. I like how it's situated within the entertainment district however if I were to only come to this area for the tacos the parking situation can be a pain as usually the parking nearby is already taken. Other than that this spot is especially good for late night food as they are open late every day. Just beware of the crowds especially after 1-2 AM as there will definitely be a wait for these tacos.",

I got 2 beef and 1 chicken taco. They give them to you with meat and cheese. They then have a \"salsa bar\" that you can choose the rest of your toppings.   Each taco was awesome and what made them even better they were $2 each. 3 tacos was just enough.   Don't go if your expecting to sit down or have a fine culinary experience. These are tacos done right, nothing else.   I'll be back I'm guessing 2-3 more times in the next 5 days",

I think her name was Harvey or she was using someone else's cashier login which is normal. This was my first time visit and my first impression was that I should choose somewhere else lol. She didn't know the menu either which was odd to me if shes supposed to be able to recommend food for the customer. Food was good, at least the tacos. The poppers had too much cheese but the steak was good. But the grilled street corn comes boiled which is weird and with only parmesan cheese? Street corn is grilled, covered in mayo, parmesan cheese, lemon and chilli. So that was a let down as well. Well this visits was at around noon so maybe it's different at other times. Hope it gets better.",

I ordered one carne asada taco and an elote. They have pictures up of the elotes so it was safe to assume it was theirs, nope it was pictures pulled from google. They give the corn burning hot in the husk, it was boiled not grilled. I had to tear off the husk and that took a bit because of how hot it was. They don't put ANYTHING on it, you have to yourself. They give you cups of cheese for it. At the salsa bar there are two salsas for the corn, no chili powder. The crema and hot sauce for the elote is nothing special especially because it melts off from how hot it is.To pay $3 for it is absurd if they just throw it in hot water and expect you to prepare it. I understand building your street taco from the bar, but not a $3 \"elote\".  As for how it tastes, it's edible but doesn't taste like anything special.",

These people barely talk to you! The tacos are ok and the toppings are ok if you catch them fresh. The limeade is great, however! Today I got three carne asada tacos, chips and salsa, and the limeade. Didn't even get a container for the salsa. I asked for large limeade and the clerk asked me if I wanted ice with it? Hello? It's a 100 degrees today! I paid her and she gave me change and then went over to the ice machine and filled my cup with ice. I hope it was not with her bare hands that she just handled the money with? Anyway, the salsa bar is often in disarray with empty or nearly empty containers and today was no exception as the green sauce was empty so I took the squeeze bottle to the counter for a refill and the clerk was deep into a checkbook ledger and looks up at me and says \"uno momento\", I think, because I could hardly hear her! Anyway, she soon forgot about me and I left...again shaking my head about why I didn't learn my lesson the last time I was here! Didn't even take any salsa with me! Some courtesy, attention to detail, and customer service would make this place a whole lot better!",

The lady behind the counter had her food-handling gloves on while she was sweeping the floor and cleaning up the place, and then she came over to take our orders while handling the money and cash register with her gloves still on.   Can you guess what she did next? You bet... she went right over and started handling our food with her dirty gloves. I spoke up and asked her if she was going to change her gloves and she replied \"Why?\" I told her and she replied \"Oh, don't worry the broom is always clean.\" I explained again and she finally acquiesced.   OK, so now let's talk about the food... I had one chicken and one steak taco. The most notable flavor on the chicken was a burnt taste. She charred the crap out of it. Now on to the steak... it was overcooked to the point of losing all its juices, so it was very dry and chewy. Completely underwhelming.   This place is clearly an after-dark spot where all the drunken people from Whiskey Row can grab some fast food to soak up all that alcohol. To that crowd, things like flavor, quality and cleanliness probably don't matter so much. But to me, they matter very much and this place absolutely failed in my experience.",

All were warm fresh and yummy, served with cabbage instead of lettuce so it's crisp, I love that, everything they make from scratch. I will definitely use them again if I'm having catering.

I'm pretty much a taco expert since I'm from LA where there are taco trucks everywhere. I gotta say, these tacos were one of the best I've had in Arizona so far.  I had two pollo and two asada, I liked the asada better but both were good. If you're up for the challenge try the red hot sauce they have. Not for the faint of heart though!",

    "text": "I noticed the original Taco stand in Scottsdale a while back and was interested due to the Yelp reviews yet we were put off because there was no where to sit and it was date night so even though not required, we prefer a bit more formality  on a Friday night. Anyway, I was interested enough that when they opened a storefront close to home I knew it was a must try. Despite a few negatives, overall it was very good for a quick bite.    Put off #1 was the service - counter person was a bit impatient and did not really seem like he was behind the product he was there to sling.  Although not all out rude, there was some frostiness about his demeanor.    Put off #2 has been mentioned in other reviews and is definitely annoying. The chips come in a huge bag which I would not ever imagine myself eating. Sorry I am into portion control on most days and a big bag of tortilla chips is not a worth it for me like a cobbler or cupcakes might be.  Who doesn't like a few chips and salsa with their taco's? Smaller portions please!  Ok, so now the good stuff:  Flavor of meats, flour tortillas, low, low prices and the worth it sugar fix - a peanut butter cookie!  I did not expect the cookie to be anything special so I was shocked and am kinda embarrassed to say that it was the best part of the meal.  I will definitely be back for more tacos, but no chips and salsa until they break down those big bags.  You bet I will be looking forward to many more cookies.",

    "text": "Found this place on yelp and went the same day for lunch. We walked in and initially we were treated with the amazing smell of meats cooking and an employee that was very friendly. She asked us if it was our first time and let us know her recommendations. We were waiting for friends so we waited to order. Once we were ready to order, another employee was at the cash register to take our order. I feel like she was new because she seemed very frazzled by our orders and had issues entering the items into the system. We paid for our food and waited for our friends to order. Meanwhile, I read my receipt and the gal rang up steak quesadillas instead of pork tacos for three of our items. I went back up to the other gal and let her know and she corrected or order. Our friends also seemed to notice that the one employee seemed very frazzled by the ordering.  Now for the food. We received our food and on one wall they have the salsa/topping bar. They had cabbage, pico, a guacamole sauce, a very mild salsa, a rip your lips off salsa,  and some jalapenos. Not very much to decorate your food with, especially since you only had the two salads to choose between, but it did the trick. Then on each of the two communal tables they had seasoning salt that you could use. Food was good especially for the price. They were good size tacos, it includes the cheese if you want it. The only main bummer about the place was that there aren't fountain drinks. Glad we brought our own bottled water because I wouldn't have wanted to spend the extra money on a bottled drink.",

If you're going to charge $15 for nachos make sure they're edible and maybe throw in some actual nacho cheese in the mix. What they served me here was offensive.

Big mistake the meat and my carne asada Taco taste like it was cooked last week. I had to spit out more than meat than I could chew. Not to mention they're more expensive than any Street Taco I've ever had. I couldn't even get through one and a half before I threw them away. If you have taste buds don't waste your time the only thing good in this place was the salsa! The people were nice the food was horrible",

I think its precooked and stored. Which you can tell from the quality of the meat as its generally med warm, greasy and leaves you with a upset stomach. I am speaking from experience of maybe 5 times. Yes, I loved the food....but at a certain point...I gotta throw in the towel.   The salsa is great. Plenty of options. Always fresh and well stocked.

TBH i went in with really low expectations because usually street tacos, while delish, are super small. I was really surprised how big and full the street tacos are!

I found myself wanting more flavor as both the chicken and carne asada did not have much. The chicken were better than the asada, which is strange for me because I love red meat. The asada tacos just weren't seasoned enough and slightly chewy in my opinion. Went to this location with my girlfriend, she didn't even finish her food and we were both hungry and love to try new places around the valley. You definitely get a good portion of meat with your food, small tacos, but lots of meat. The best part of the meal was the limeade, now that was to die for! Freshly squeezed and very tasty, not too sweet, perfect! I live not too far from this location and was hoping to have a good taco place nearby, not the case. I expected a whole lot more from a business who received \"The best of Scottsdale 2015\" award.   Decor- We were slightly confused by the decor to say the least. Only TWO tables, which is more than their scottsdale location, but still not enough unless you don't mind sitting with strangers. The walls and floor had a modern look, but the wooden trim and decorations didn't match the style or color they were going for. Slightly odd, but you go to a restaurant for the food not the decor.",

I went to go sit down and it felt like I was almost going to fall over. A suggestion to keep the simple menu and add more variety were to give two options: tacos and quesadillas, and then up to 5 meats to choose from for those who like both simplicity and variety.  Will definitely be back in the future to see how they improve on things.",

Guy at the counter wasn't very welcoming either.  Wanted to give them a fair chance since I read how they got started.   Would try again after they're more settled in and see if they make changes.    Salsa bar was awesome but price was a little high per taco.   Will try it again another time.",

So, naturally, I stopped and ordered 3 tacos (since I couldn't decide on one, I decided to order all three to try them all). The service was good, fast, and friendly. The Al Pastor was by far my favorite, and probably one of the best Al Pastor tacos I've had in a very long time. Perfectly seasoned and cooked meat with a sprinkle of cheese. I added the pico de gallo and the guacamole. Nothing fancy. Fantastic! I also ordered the carne asada and pollo tacos as well and they were great too, but there was something about that Al Pastor. You should definitely hit up this taco truck when you're downtown!",

Luckily, I had all the extra stuff to put on everything. It was from bad to Ok. It was cold. The nachos had half a cup of meat and barely any cheese. At the end of it all, we winded up putting the meat from the tacos onto the nachos. Maybe because it was late on a week day, but hopefully next time is better.",

    "text": "I remember going to this Wadaa location when it had just opened after their recent move from Scottsdale. I remember liking their tacos - even though it took us an incredibly long time to return and use the \"free taco\" cards we received from the owner.   Wadaa has a simple menu. I ordered both a carne asada and pollo taco, with both a flour and corn tortilla. I also ordered a cheese-only quesadilla, while my girlfriend opted for two asada. They sprinkle a bit of cheese on top and you're free to add what you like from the salsa bar.  Honestly, the tacos are just okay. The tortillas are very good quality. The asada has more of a marinated/wet flavor to it, as opposed to the smoky and slightly charred style that I usually prefer. My girlfriend thought she remembered it tasting a bit better during our first visit. The chicken had a bit more of a flavor pop, but only slightly.   As another reviewer states, due to their late hours, it might just be the kind of place where you need to show up loaded on alcohol at midnight in order to truly appreciate what they're doing here. It seems odd that they would leave Scottsdale, an area that probably offers far more drunken nightlife traffic - but also a higher priced location, so it probably makes sense.  The place is clean, the tacos are simple, and although they aren't quite up to the level where I would place them in the upper-end of cheap-eating tacos in The Valley, they're still worth a try every now and again.  Check them out.",

How awesome that I don't have to drive all the way down there if I'm craving these these tacos! But my experience here fell flat. I'm not sure if it was because it was super slow in there and I was the only customer that had walked in in a while but I felt like I was being rushed out of there and this reflected in the quality of the food that I received. I asked for steak tacos with a flour tortilla. I also requested that the tortilla be well done and I was told that this could not be done- which I've never had a problem with at the stand I go to in old town Scottsdale. But I let it go. When I opened up my tacos, I noticed that not only was the tortilla not well done but it was completely undercooked :(   Did not have a very good taste. Flavors fell kind of flat. I guess it's back to old town for me.",

But my only disappointment is it's not cooked fresh to order, premade & refrigerated - fine if it's the same day - BUT IF ITS A TIME SAVER, it's NOT HELPING. Food takes forever! Also no room to sit - I'd love to see them get smaller tables and put more in - I'd rather eat it fresh but we had to go because no seating.

    "text": "So happy we found this hidden gem open on the 4th of July when everything else was closed. They are open holidays and late nights till 1am. They also do delivery through grub hub.   It's a very nice small walk up and order type shop. There is two large tables in there to eat at but on a weekend it might get full fast so you can always grab it to go.   Simple menu of chicken or steak tacos. They are street taco size but they load them up with meat. I would say 3-4 will fill you up when hungry and 2 would satisfy. They give you the option of flour or corn tortillas and if you want cheese. Food is ready pretty fast. They have a self serve salsa bar with your choice of toppings from salsa, pico, limes, cabbage, and a really good avocado cream sauce.   I tried both the chicken and steak tacos and both were super good. The chicken was my favorite. Mixture of dark and light meat with lots of flavor. I added pico and the avocado sauce which made it delicious.  We will be back for more tacos. Thank you wadaa for satisfying our authentic Mexican taco craving!",

    "text": "I love places that have a simple menu, for two reasons. First, you know exactly what you want when you go in to order. Secondly, it's the place you want to go when a specific food pops into your mind. Wadaa is that place when I think of tacos, which happens fairly often since I live in Phoenix.  This place has a really upbeat atmosphere. Always has some kind of high energy pop music and crazy lights going when I show up. Also a very clean store, so major points for that. I usually go for the carne asada tacos, and I'm never disappointed. They have a great salsa bar, with a very spicy salsa option, a smooth guacamole, and all of the onions + cilantro and limes you could ever need. Prices are reasonable too. I don't mind paying $3 per taco for something of this quality.",

    "text": "Eh..schmeh!   My buddy at work, Bill, and I had the same lunch break last week.  We decided to hit up some lunch and Bill suggested some tacos.  I am ALWAYS down with tacos for lunch, so I Yelp searched a few spots near work and decided to try this place out.  4.5 star average reviews, close to work, and it sounded like it would be pretty good.  About that...........  We pulled up to the place, walked inside and placed our orders.  They keep things simple here and offer just 2 meats...carne asada and pollo asado.  I went with 4 tacos total, 2 pollo and 2 carne asada.  During lunch, they have their tacos discounted to $2.00 each, instead of regularly priced $3.00 each.  Total was just under $9.00.  I made my way to the salsa bar (the one good thing about the visit), loaded up on their 2 salsa choices, some pico and some cilantro/onion mix.  A couple of minutes later, my tacos were ready. Here is how they were............  Carne Asada-  These tacos came on a flour tortilla with carne asada and some cheese on top.  You dress them yourself.  They looked ok, but unfortunately the taste was not that great.  The carne asada was cubed up a little more than I like, plus the texture and flavor was kind of  \"off\".  It almost tasted like they soaked/grilled the carne asada in soy sauce.  It was a weird flavor.  I am a simple man when it comes to my asada.  Charcoal grilled (if possible), or just some salt and pepper if done on the flat top.  I also hit a few pieces of gristle throughout the 2 tacos.  They weren't disgusting, but I have had WAY better carne asada tacos. The tortillas they were on WERE good though.  I'll give them props on their tortillas but that's about it.  Pollo Asado-  Same presentation as the carne asada.  Chicken, cheese on a flour tortilla.  The pollo asado tasted better than the carne asada, but even then, it was a little too soft for my liking and had the same kind of marinade on it.  Once again, not disgusting, but far from great.  Overall, I think I am just spoiled from having lived in San Diego for 10 years.  We had SO MANY GOOD TACO joints down there that are head and shoulders above anything I have found in Phoenix so far.  I don't see myself ever craving this place or ever coming back.  Thank goodness it was during lunch and the discounted pricing because if these 4 tacos would have cost me $13-14 dollars, I would have been pissed!  Anyways.....Meh.  2 stars!",

The sauces not at all impressive. The horchata was not good and definitely not fresh or homemade style. The good thing is they have coke products but other than that there was nothing special about this place. Maybe when it first opened it was good but for the fact they only offer two types of tacos and quesadillas I wasn't at all impressed.  We can we tried and left disappointed",

The place is small and they don't have a lot of variety on their menu, but what they have is DELICIOUS!!  They have Asada (Steak) and Pollo (chicken) tacos which are $2.74 each. Quesadillas $3.65 with meat each. They also have drinks like Fresh lemonade, Horchata, Jamaica, Soda, and water. Prices vary based off of what you want. Chips and salsa are $3.50. I have only tried the tacos and Quesadillas. Amazing! Simple, but very good.   They have a nice size salsa bar with different kinds of salsa, cilantro, onions. cabbage and limes.   Open late 10 am to 1 pm daily.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.",

The Good: - Meat is tender and flavorful beyond. - Portion size and prices are ok by me. - Workers are chill and food comes fast. - The hours are great, can grab a late bite.   The Bad: - No rice, beans, or burritos options. - No place to sit or stand and eat.  - Cabbage is too chunky (should finely shave it).   The Ugly: - Take out packing doesn't let taco hold up well.   - Patrons are sauced from nearby bar (but nice).  - Taco so good you'll look deranged when eating.    Bottom line is the negatives aren't really a biggie when the food is so frickin tasty.  Couple of tweaks and this place would crush it.",

Maybe add a mild one in there?",

You follow your nose a little further though the bars and it leads you to WAdAA! a cool little taco stand. There they're grilling up their meats using wood. Walk a little closer to where the action happens and you feel the aromatic heat hit you full force. How they work in that open oven I have no idea. But I'm glad they do it. The meat has this beautiful char, and as you bite through it, it's the most perfect tender/juicy meat you'll find in a taco. Add all the fixings they have on the side and you're golden. I can't tell you the name of any bars we went to that night, but WAdAA! is where it's at! We ate there 3 times in the 2 days we visited.",

The last time I was here I saw a girl knock another girl's cell phone out of her hand, breaking it and subsequently refusing to pay for it after repeated drunken demands. Proceed to escalation: name calling, stumbling around in high heels, aggressive posturing, male friends stepping in trying to defuse the situation. No such luck, as girl A hops into a golf cart, girl B runs over to her, grabs her phone and spikes it on the concrete. More escalation, followed by the storming off of Girl B with her broken cell phone after threats of police intervention.  Where else in the Phoenix metro area do you get to see live-action Jersey Shore while eating a delicious $5 taco?  Entertainment, price, product, Wadaa has it all.",

A fellow patron warned me about the hot sauce and he advised it's \"very spicy\", so spicy, he said his eyes \"teared\". Well now, lets get to business, I thought! Wamp. It tasted like a generic store brand salsa. Not hot, no kick and flavorless. Their asada is tasty, however, they use flour tortillas (again, that's NOT a street taco) instead of corn, so the portion of meat is a joke. Tacos cost $3, which is way too expensive for a street taco. If you go to any taco stand/cart/truck in East Los, El Monte, South Gate, Whittier, Lincoln Heights, Highland Park or Boyle Heights, you pay anywhere from $.55 (on Taco Tuesday) to $1.25 for a REAL street taco.   My friend turned around and asked me, \"What street are these tacos from?! Beverly Hills?\" It's obviously geared toward Scottsdale people.   Nice try Wadaa, but no dice.",

I had a couple tacos just plain and they were fine, but nothing special. You can watch them grilling their meat, so you know it's fresh. As I bit into the taco a stream of grease ran down my hand.... maybe not what people are going for when out on a Friday night. The tacos were a bit bland and crying for some salsa. I'll have to check this place out again and get some toppings to truly judge. Will be back.",

Throw some pico and fresh chopped cabbage on it and you have a substantial little taco.  Oh, the spicy red sauce has a real kick to it.",

The hot salsa was HOT. It's not the I can handle some heat hot but for the extreme hotness lovers which I am so I had no problem. I assume it was a bit of a vinegar based hot so it wasn't my favorite flavor but the heat made up for that.   The quesadilla was simple. Two tortillas with meat and cheese sandwiched between. I probably wouldn't do the quesadilla again simply because it was essentially two tacos with more cheese and less meat. Very good but not my preference.

My husband ordered two carne asada tacos to try and I wasn't that hungry but saw a sign that said \"Authentic Elote.\" So I decided to have that, I love a good elote. After we paid, the lady told us where the salsa bar was and she mentioned, \"the mayo is over there also.\" I asked my husband...\"do I assemble myself?\" When I got my \"elote\" it was just a steamed corn with a small container of cheese. The cheese was parmesan cheese, not cotija cheese. The mayo was mixed with melted butter in a squeeze bottle. I had to put together my elote. This was not an \"authentic elote\" and I was very disappointed. My husband didn't like his tacos either. He said there was no flavor and the tortillas served on were cold. The only thing we enjoyed was our bottle of orange Fanta and the friendliness of the cashier. She gave us these coupons since it was our first time there; I'm sorry but we won't be returning.",

However...its also perfect at 11:44-11:46 am.  4 Tacos down in two min.  Yum.  Grilled over Mesquite Wood.  Tried steak and Chicken and both corn and flour.  I suggest Steak on Corn.  Pico is fresh and really good.  Im impressed, best street tacos ive had in AZ so far.   Id love a buy 3 get one free @ $3 a piece...but that was a damn fine $12 lunch.  Will be back. ***I expect the pic below is not meant as an insult, not meant as a salute.  I think its merely a friendly reminder to lick your fingers clean of the deliciousness after your are done inhaling your order.",

The red salsa has a great spicy flavor. The green salsa is my favorite, the fresh avacado that is in every bottle is amazing and the lime juice they squeeze in there is perfect.   The only thing that frustrates me are the long lines during the weekends, but I still manage to stay. It is defenetly a must stop for all tourists visiting Scottsdale, Arizona.

    "text": "Just what the name says. You walk up to a rolled up garage door and order tacos, asada or pollo. Thats the whole menu. Now let me re-phrase that. You NEED to walk up to a rolled up garage door and order tacos, steak or chicken.  Wadaa is cooking the meat on a grill over mesquite hardwood charcoal. The tacos are simply served on a tortilla with cheese, then you add lettuce, pico de gallo, and fresh lime. There are two sauces. a mild green sauce that appears to be a creamy cilantro avacado sauce and a red sauce. Don't let that red sauce fool you. It's fire in a bottle. Unless you are into heat, stick with the green sauce. If you want corn tortillas instead of flour, ask for them. The drink selection is very limited, only three iced drinks and some canned sodas. I ordered three tacos. 2 asada and 1 pollo. I tried 1 of the asada tacos with the red sauce and the other two tacos with the green. I loaded each with lettuce and a generous portion of the rustic house made pico. The meat was flavorful and tender. I splashed too much sauce on the steak tacos without knowing how hot the sauces were. Let's just say you can't judge a book by it's cover. The red sauce is definitely hot and left my mouth numb. It is well made and flavorful and the heat kicks in at the end. If you are walking around downtown scottsdale, find this place. But be prepared to keep walking. there are no seats.  Warm Fuzzies (the good stuff) -fantastic flavor -Basic, simple and done right. -food and sauces made in house. -a real hardwood charcoal grill, not gas or briquettes. -friendly staff (owners?) -Limited menu. Just a couple things and they are perfected.   Cold Baldies (the not so good stuff) -no seats -limited menu. Need fountain drinks. -sauce pours out of bottles very quickly.",

I've rarely, and I mean *very* rarely, ever encountered tacos that approximate what you can get from a simple street vendor in Baja. The most important thing is grilling over mesquite hardwood, followed by grilling home style corn tortillas, and of course providing the right toppings: Pico de gallo, cabbage, that deep red super spicy salsa, and a nice thin aguacate salsa. Mmmmm...delish! Both the carne Asada and chicken were outstanding. At $3/taco a bit on the pricey side for a roadside stand, but worth every penny!!!",
