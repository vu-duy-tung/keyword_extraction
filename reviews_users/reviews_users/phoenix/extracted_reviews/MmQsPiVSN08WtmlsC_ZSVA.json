As a bonus I received 5 wings instead of 4 that are listed on the menu. Definitely worth the $1 upcharge on the meal.",

I wan not impressed with the chicken or pork tacos, to me the meat was a bit dry and with the tortilla it just added to it.   Shrimp taco yum Spicy mayo bomb  Pork and pineapple combo good Pork and chicken was dry   I'll give it another shot one day.

If you want to eat there you have a few tables. I think two or three to choose from. These are located outside in the Arizona heat. There is shade. But when it is 110 the shade does not make comfortable to eat outside. Most people were just ordering and taking it home, to their work place, eating in car. None of these being my choice. We ate there. I believe there would be more people eating there if there was more seating outside and some misters. I will be back but after it cools off.",

Tiny lil place made of shipping containers.  My complaint today was overly chewy chips.  Also, the chips were caked with salt.  They tasted stale & I was given diet coke.  I didn't notice until almost home.  Ok the part where I can be positive.  Fresh food & friendly staff.  I love the verde & brushfire salsa.  Yesterday I tried the potato croquets & they were pretty good.  Hot as hell so I know they're fresh.  Then my shrimp taco was yummy as well.  Shrimp was spicier that expected but I still loved out.  In the past I've tried the beans, friend shrimp & potatoes.  None of them let me down.  They were all fresh cooked & really delicious.

I got a chorizo burrito and man does it taste good! You pay a good price for a huge burrito. You can also get tacos there. This last time that I went like a week ago I got the shrimp burrito and I got their brush fire sauce. The first time I can't remember what sauce I got. But I do know that the brush fire sauce tastes bomb. I can typically only eat about half of the burrito and then I have to save the rest for later. Oh and this place is like a Dutch bros except for burritos. It's a drive through and then theirs a little sitting area outside like Dutch bros has. So it's kinda cool. If you live in the area, you have your breakfast from here and your coffee from Dutch bros. It's literally the perfect spot for this place. The people are really nice too. Literally my stomach is grumbling thinking of this place right now. One of my favorite places and a definite try.",

Went up to window to let them know & said they would have to ring up my $2.89 empanada because we were never charged for it. And we went over our order w girl at window before we paid. To make things worse the couple sitting next to us got a $20 gift card! A guy came out to tell them it was a thing they were doing for 5 De Mayo. Goid Job Brushfire for messing up an order & making customers happy for it! Never again in this place!",

    "text": "This is a small semi/fast casual free standing taco & tapas shop in the middle of a busy parking lot. They have OUTDOOR DINING ONLY. You order either threw the drive threw or the walk up window.   Some things were better than other things.  We shared a variety of things.  The chicken empanada was tasty and out of the tacos I tried I liked the vegetable one best because it had the most flavors and textures. I didn't try the shrimp taco but my husband liked that one the best.  The chicken and steak tacos were kind of meh and had little flavor.  The fish taco was awful and tasted fishy. They need to remove that one from the menu.  The side order of beans was just like beans in water. I don't know if this is the way they normally make it but if it is they need a new recipe for beans. I do note that the place had only kids working there on our visit. I don't know if it's that way all the time.  Service wasn't the best. We ordered a side of guacamole that was ignored and when we got our sack of food it was missing utensils and napkins. My husband had to go back and wait in line to get forks.  I would still recommend going here instead of something like a taco bell but just be prepared that this isn't the best.",

I also wish they had an outside drink station to get more water or tea.  I do not enjoy standing in line a second time because I am thirsty.

Instead I got a pork (or chorizo) breakfast burrito when all I ordered was a steak breakfast burrito, and was told twice it was a steak breakfast burrito.

Not the case. The steak burrito was big, full of flavor, and the steak was pretty tender. The Chorizo Taco was so good! For 1.99 I got a flower taco stuff full of Chorizo, potatoes, eggs, and spiced mayo. The spice in that mayo is no joke. I suggest getting it on the side the first time around. It took me 2 days to finish my food. Next time I'll stick to a taco. It was plenty.",

    "text": "Went here the first time last night. I'm a broke college student, so this is normally out of my price range. Saw a groupon the other night for a sushi joint and went on to grab it, but it wasn't there anymore. I continued looking and decided on this place.   I didn't really know what I wanted, guy at the counter immediately came over and asked. Started asking me how hungry I was, then told me to get a burrito.   So, based on that I ordered a shrimp burrito, with a side of pinto beans and a side of rice, thinking the burrito wouldn't be that big. Damn, was I wrong. This burrito was bigger than one of Chipotle's, all in all. Tasted way better than Chipolte, though and at nearly the same price. The spicy mayo brought a nice flavor to the shrimp, the fresh veggies gave it a nice texture. It was awesome. My only qualm with it was that the shrimp was a little chewy, but it still tasted awesome. The pico had awesome flavor. The pinto beans and cilantro rice were both excellent, not sure what cheese they put on the beans, but I didn't really care for it. Would rather just have plain pintos, or if they had black beans available, that would have been even better.  The salsas were subpar, IMO. The volcano didn't have a ton of flavor and just relied on the heat, the verde... just didn't taste right.  The only other qualm I would've had, is that it was a little cold. I'm not sure if it was due to the transport time and the temp outside (it was chilly last night), but it did take me 5-10 minutes or so to get it home.  The price, I feel, was reasonable for the size. Without the groupon, it would've been around $11 (steep, but right around Chipolte). I didn't order any tacos, so I can't comment on that. Really, though, I'm a big dude at 220 lbs. I tapped out about halfway through the burrito and the sides. Felt like I couldn't take another bite, but it was so wonderfully delicious that I wanted too. I originally bought these so that I could run up during lunch on school days and bring this back, but there is so much food, no way I could finish it. So, it got DD status (designated dinner).  Edited it to add this: I think you can see where the one stars are coming from and not to avoid it, because of that. Nearly all were right at opening and obviously there has been improvement, shown by the reviews increasing as you go up.",

We went with corn tortillas instead of the flour.  The spicy salsa we got on the side was good on all three tacos.  We also tried the chicken empanada with spicy mayo, which was pretty good but not sure it was worth the calories, as it was fried and served with spicy mayo.  We probably would just go with more tacos next time.",

I'll take it either way. A MUST TRY!!!",

I'm a BIG \"value\" guy though and I'm not sure it's that good of a value. My lunch was a chicken taco \"flight\" (their term for a combo meal) to include chips and salsa, a drink and a side. I paid another $1 for the shrimp side. Al in it was over $9 to sit on a concrete bench outside and eat out of styrofoam. I think that if chipotle can be a brick and mortar with a dining room and serve fresh Mexican food with their overhead.... And make HUGE MONEY....This joint made from shipping containers and no dining room should be a slightly better value in the price department.  That said... The food was great.",

Very tasty and i would definitely recommend this place as a quick takeout place. Its also convenient if you like Dutch Bros which is only about 100ft away from Brushfire.",

There was nobody in drive through and nobody at the order window.  For some reason I had to wait about 5 minutes for someone to take my order.  I was not sure why I had to wait so long when there was no other customers.  I ordered 2 steak tacos ($8.71) for lunch and got the order fairly quick.  I sat down at one of their outdoor tables to consume my meal.  I was surprised to see that the tacos were very small and looked nothing like what I saw in the pictures.    I was anxious to try the tacos expecting an explosion of flavors, but both tacos were a big disappointment.  The steak was flavorless and chewy like rubber.  It seemed like it was cooked several times frozen then reheated.  The only flavor I could taste is the pico.  It was the blandest and dryest taco that I ever had eaten.  I started to think that the reviews I read may be from the owners of the company trying to pump up their business.  I am not sure if I should give this place a second chance.  I have to say that Taco Bell's steak taco tastes much better and you can get them for $1.00 a piece.",

I was one happy camper because each gift was for a different restaurant I hadn't visited. As I would say, nice!  Brushfire Taco Y Tapas had been on my to do list for a while, but I always thought it was a takeaway with a small dinning room. It's not, it's a drive-thru with some concrete outdoor seating. Now remember that if you come here after sundown.  LOL  The food was very good, bordering on amazing. We liked their Carne Asada burrito the best and their spicy inferno salsa was to die for. It was so good you wish they could have served it as Gazpacho Andaluz soup. I would rate it 7 on a ten scale for heat. Delicious.   As you can see from the photos, we had more than enough food for the three of us. Expect to pay $10 to $15 each for some very good Spanish inspired Mexican food. And, don't forget to order their tasty huge (photo)Tapas.  I was told they were thinking of opening a location in Scottsdale. Yes!  Enjoy!",

I eat a lot of chicken tacos so this is saying a lot. I also had a grilled fish taco and I simply wasn't expecting to be wowed. It was just delicious and again, generous portion, instead of all tortilla and it was cooked perfectly tender, not dry at all.  The price was reasonable especially for the quality. I think it was $7.xx for the two and I was quite satisfied. But best of all, on the patio there was this delightful sign reminding us to invite someone to sit at our table. I know I used to be too uncomfortable to do as such, but I truly believe it's just the kind of thing we need more of.  So I greatly look forward to returning, and sharing a seat!",

    "text": "Finally they have something going on for Taco Tuesday. Stop by on Tuesdays to pay $5 for a combination of a taco and tapa of your choice. The tacos that apply to the special are chicken, pork, and veggie. The tapas up for selection are empanada, croquetas, and papas bravas. Unfortunately, steak and shrimp tacos are not included in the $5 combo. I still like the steak tacos best. The chicken tacos are not too shabby though.    I started joining the Brushfire Loyalty Club. Basically, I just enter my phone number to earn points for rewards every time I order. They often will text me about promotions going on, such as earning triple points on New Year or free chips & salsa.   I took away one star because every time I order an empanada, they always forget to place it in the bag. The first incident I paid $2.49 for the empanada togo, and realized when I got home that they did not put my empanada in my bag. With the second incident, I ordered an empanada, checked the bag at the window, and once again they failed to remember the empanada that I paid for. I would highly suggest checking that all your orders are in the bag before driving off. They will forget!",

Let me add he is super Picky. I should have told them that when I ordered but I didn't really think about it. They gave me this huge messy burrito .. beans falling out of it. Of course my son thought it was totally unmanageable and didn't want to have anything to do with it after that. (Insert rolling eyes emoji) I took it back and they fixed it just like I wanted. (\"Half this size or even smaller.\" \"Please cut it in half so he can pick it up.\" \"Way too many beans in there.\") They were so nice about it. I felt like a Heel asking them to do it that way but I'll remember next time bc after they made it kid-size, he loved it. THANK YOU ALL!",

I must saw the service was good and the employees were very friendly.   However, that's where the good stopped.  I ordered the steak flight meal.  For my side, I chose the cilantro lime rice and it came with 1 steak taco, chips with salsa, and a regular soda.  The first thing I tried was the rice and boy was it bland and very mushy.  The majority of it was so mush iy was in a big ball of goo.  Now on to the taco.  I immediately could tell that it was cold, the tortilla was not previously warmed and made for a terrible meal.  80% of the meat was fatty nd could not be chewed thru.  The guacamole was brown tinged and definitely seemed it was from days prior.  Blaaahh!!!  On to the chips, there can't possibly be anything wrong with them right?!?  WRONG!  The chips were even stale and not crisp at all.  This visit was a big fat fail.  I would never return.  Mind you that this place is not cheap.  My meal was $8.65 for junk!!  It was so disappointing!!  Hopefully,  if you venture to try this place you will have a better experience and some fresher food!",

My experience with AZMEX has been a very unpleasant experience so I am reluctant to try new mexican food places because of this. This place was a pleasant surprise. The food and ingredients seem to be freshly prepared and have robust flavor. The place is a little bit pricey for the items they offer but then again if you want fresh tasting that is understandable. My only complaints is for the silly thing I see a lot of AZ restaurants doing and that is charging for refills. Why nickle and dime. I'm not going to pay 20% of the full price of the drink cause I am thirsty from sitting outside in the heat. Just make sure that when you go that you plan to go when it is cooler cause there is only outdoor seating and drive thru. I felt like I was eating at a Mexican taco shop eating outside. Overall I recommend to try this place as I think it is far better than the lard laden restaurants like Carolina's that so many people love. No comparison. Do yourself a favor and try this place.",

Two steak and egg breakfast burritos I was glad I took the opportunity to try them. Their burritos are bigger than McDs and not quite as huge as Filiberto's.  A good size, well wrapped in a flour tortilla with a generous amount of filling and at a fairly reasonable price. They are located next to Dutch Bros Coffee and you can find it a challenge to get near Brushfire at 930 in the morning!  The service was reasonably fast but, most of all, I was warmly greeted and the food was very satisfactory.  I am still out on the \"secret sauce\"-it had a little kick but not overbearing.  No doubt I will be back to try their lunch menu soon. I feel like this was a great deal and a worthwhile stop. McD's is right across the street in case you need something to wash the food down and are not a coffee drinker!!.",

Got there and the prices had been increased by a dollar per taco. Got 4 tacos anyway and went home. We got one of each except for the vegetarian. They fell apart when we tried to eat them. The flour tortillias were pretty poor and could not hold the filling. The beef, chicken and pork tacos had little flavor. The shrimp was OK. The rice was very bland, little cilantro and no lime, and the beans had little flavor. The owner has pledged to give 51% of his profits to charity which is good, but I shouldn't have to subsidize his generosity by a 50% increase in the cost of the food. We will not be going back.",

The papas bravas are always my favorite to get. Other than that the other lunch and dinner tacos are pretty good but breakfast I think takes the trophy. This place is definitely worth a try everything is really good here. :)",

They have a rewards point system but you can't manage or check it without going there and seems like every time I've built up points and go to use them they've magically disappeared.   Would be 5 stars if can get the service/attitudes we've experienced lately in check and work on your rewards program. I do love their spicy mayo.",

It's a poor location, very crammed for just an oversized, nonmobile food truck. Start with correcting service, the easy errors - not just making combo meals and getting rid of taco flights.

    "text": "I have eaten here 100 times over the last two years, not kidding. The food is great! There are a few reasons I stopped going: 1, it is VERY overpriced. As in, you will pay 8 bucks for a burrito half the size of a chipotle burrito and 5 bucks for a street taco that you would have to eat 4 of to be satisfied. Don't get me wrong the food is good, but if I take my girl here we end up spending 30 bucks to go through a drive through for 2 people. Way too much money for fast food.   The second reason I stopped going was this: I also don't like the idea of being peer pressured to tip someone for handing me my food through a drive through window. It teaches unwarranted entitlement to a young person that they are deserving of tips for doing nothing tip worthy. It has happened to me several times here, and since I work hard for my money I don't like the idea of giving it to someone else for no reason just because they have their hand out and think they deserve it.  Now trust me when I tell you that I am not a cheapskate and I am a very good tipper. I enjoy tipping people who rate a tip and don't mind paying more for better products. However, this place is using a product pricing system and tipping system that is WAY above their caliber and status of restaurant.",

    "text": "If it wasn't for an email from Local Arizona, this taco shop would've slipped through my fingers. Tempted by promises of a free taco and/or churro with every meal on this particular day, a so-called \"grand opening\" special, I trekked out to this quaint little spot weary of what I might find. From previous reviews, which confused me since I pondered how there could be a month or so of reviews when the grand opening is actually today, \"gourmet tacos\" find their way at a drive through at a steep price, I had to find out for myself though and so off we went to put our taste buds to the test.  The menu is confusing because you can get a single taco or a \"flight.\" On the upper right corner of the menu, a small red box says, \"Get a flight, and you get a tapa, chips and salsa, and a small drink!\" That sounds excellent, but how many tacos come in a flight? One! One single taco comes in a flight. Spoiled by Taco Bell, you get 2 chalupas AND a beef taco with a meal. I was slightly disappointed by a single taco in the flight. You also have the choice of making that rolled taco into a burrito with the same ingredients, but hey, we didn't want to get too crazy with our order, so we just stuck with taco style.  Although the girl who took our order recommended chicken tacos, we ordered a flight of the steak tacos and a flight of the pork al pastor with pineapple tacos. Our hungry little appetites are seldom satiated by a single taco so we ordered 2 extra shrimp tacos and 1 extra steak taco. Since they were flights, we were able to order 1 tapa each, so we both got the flaky chicken empanadas. The empanadas had the correct flakiness and texture but were on the thinner side and came with spicy mayo.   We really enjoyed our steak and pork tacos. From the reviews, I thought these would be street taco size, but I say they are slightly bigger. All tacos were overfilled with meat, the way I like my tacos to be! They are soft flour rolled tacos. Corn tortillas are by request. The taste of the tacos were really good. I expected less because of the drive through experience, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Today only, due to the grand opening special, they also offered a free churro with each meal and handed out free taco cards.   When ordering here, I would get a steak or pork taco flight, choose the empanada as your tapa side, AND order an extra taco - preferably a shrimp one (to get the surf and turf effect)! Then, you would leave here satisfied and not hungry afterwards. If you have an extra hearty appetite then order 2 extra tacos, then you should be good. And extra FYI, the papas (fried seasoned potatoes) served with spicy mayo and the cilantro rice make good sides too if you wanted a little extra fillers.   It's a fun little find. With free taco cards at hand, heck yeah, we will be back. I love tacos like crazy! Especially gourmet ones that are attainable by drive through! I mean, hey... there's just some days I'm too lazy to drive downtown, or the east side, to get my taco fix. Brushfire has lit my fire, but it's a small kindling flame at that. I want to know if it's the 'A' game today because it's their grand opening or if they're really that good usually because previous reviews say otherwise.",

    "text": "Brushfire is a neat concept...very food truck-esque, with its drive thru and patio options 'round the small kitchen establishment. Brought here via a Groupon deal, I was excited to try the small, but interesting menu.   Among the carne asada taco, shrimp taco and chicken empanada, the steak taco was my favorite, with great fresh toppings, including a little guac. I expected more from the shrimp taco, which was a little too seafood fragrant for my liking. I understand that frozen shrimp may be necessary for this type of place and that doesn't always mean bad! However, though the shrimp tasted fine, the smell was a little potent... also, not a fan of the slaw...wayyyyy too many carrots. No other explanation. Just odd.   The empanada itself was good though I didn't get the lettuce dressed with some globby white substance (plain mayo?) in addition to their spicy mayo sauce (which was tasty, even for a non-mayo person).   I've got two more $8 vouchers so I will be back, but I am not sure I'll be a frequent visitor. For the money, Rubio's is better and included the salsa bar. I do applaud this local place's effort though!",

You place your order at the window and then wait at one of the outside tables for your name to be called.

    "text": "So first of all, I'm not big on writing reviews. I think this might be my first one? But I just want to bring this to the managers/owners attention. So my boyfriend and I frequently go there to eat because we love the food so much. The food is usually good but EVERY SINGLE TIME  we go, they miss something. It's always either salsas or the sauces. I've even had them forget my chips that come with the meal. Oh also, they always forget about the forks. Their pretty expensive for a fast food place, we spend almost $30 for two people every time we go & we tip them. So especially for that price it's pretty frustrating that something is always left out. Idk if there can be a better system at the drive through window or something to fix this issue. But we're just getting super disappointed each time we go... :(",

Sometimes empanadas get tough but this one was flaky and delish  It is a convenient location, but I won't go back unless someone else initiates.",

Immediately saw the empanadas on the menu and just HAD to order that. Husband ordered the chorizo burrito (cause it was only about 8:30 a.m.), and some quesadillas and churros for our 3 yr. old that was with us. I was very happy with my chicken empanadas! Its not the traditional corn flour empanadas like the ones I had in Cancun, but the filling was delicious. The outside was very flaky and yummy as well! They serve it with spicy mayo on the side. I ordered their salsa Verde (which is on the mediym scale if spiciness; so if you like a \"comfortable kick\", then get this one. It went well with the mayo and empanadas. My husband was impressed with the chorizo burrito. Some places cook the chorizo WITH the eggs, but Brushfire didn't, so it has more of a chorizo flavor. They also had potatoes, a melted cheese (that wasn't thick; more on the runny side, so went perfectly with the rest of the filling), and spicy mayo. It was good and a good size....not thin like those silly McDonalds breakfast burritos. Very pleasantly surprised by this small outdoor restaurant. Will definitely be back to try their tacos! Guy who took our order was also very friendly and welcoming! A must-try!",

I wasn't sure what to try when I pulled up to the window so this isn't going to be a full review on the whole menu. Only on what I had and my girlfriend had.   I ordered a chicken taco, pork taco, 2 shrimp tacos, and the croquetas.   The chicken taco was so-so... They forgot my salsa which would've helped but the taco itself didn't have much flavor and the chicken was slightly on the dry side. I was glad I ordered a pork taco because that one was more tasty. Im not a huge fan of pineapple but it definitely made the pork taco unique and pretty tasty. Didn't even need salsa. The croquetas were the best part!! they were nice and warm, very cheesy with a good tangy chipotle type sauce on top.   My girlfriend's two shrimp tacos were pretty tasty and had a yummy sauce on it. She ordered it without the slaw which I think would've made it better.   Portions were small but I wasn't too hungry so it wasn't going to kill me. I'll go again to try more things because I find myself at Dutch Bros a lot. I'll post an update on more menu items as i try them.",

    "text": "Imagine if Chipotle and Filiberto's had a baby, and read on!  I've been eagerly awaiting the opening of this \"shipping container restaurant\" next to Dutch Brothers on 83rd Avenue and Thunderbird Road. Anytime we can get a non mega chain in the Peoria/Glendale area, I'm the first in line. The construction on this building was slow going, and it wasn't until last night that I realized it was open, as I drove to Sprouts in the same parking lot. I am still unsure if this is a soft opening, but according to their Facebook, they've been open nearly a month. Very curious.  Let's discuss the notion of a drive thru/walk up only restaurant. I think it is entirely novel and very fitting that Brushfire Tacos y Tapas is literally steps away from Dutch Brothers. While the drive through is not yet open, the walk up window is. I love the innovative use of the storage container to house an entire restaurant, it is a way to \"upcycle\" or use something old in an innovative way. It seems almost too forward thinking for this side of town, or even this state; it's very \"Portland.\" I'm thrilled!!  Enough of the restaurant and anticlimactic opening; let's discuss the food. My boyfriend and I sampled just about every Mexican option this evening, spending nearly $30 on enough food for at least 3 people. Next time we will sample some things off of the Tapas side of the menu. I tried one of each:  Vegetable Taco- I only ate a few bites, but this was very good. The primary ingredient tasted like breakfast style potatoes with a mix of peppers, mushrooms, and salsa. It wasn't spicy, but it was flavorful and would be filling for vegetarians and non vegetarians alike.  Chicken Taco/Burrito- Pretty straightforward but still good. The chicken was somewhere in between Filiberto's and Chipotle: better quality than Filly B's, but not as flavorful or juicy as Chipotle. Basic taco with pico de gallo and cheese. My boyfriend got the Chicken Burrito which is their standard one. It's as big as a Chipotle Burrito rolled with rice, beans, guac, lettuce, pico, cilantro lime dressing, and cheese. Overall, more ingredients and flavors than a standard Chipotle burrito. He thought it was overall better than a Filiberto's chicken burrito, and almost better than Chipotle if only the rice had more flavor.  Al Pastor Taco- Warning, no Al Pastor ever satisfies me like America's Taco Shop, so it's almost a futile effort that I sample Al Pastor everywhere. The pork was fine, but had an almost unnaturally sweet pineapple flavor. I liked that they were generous with the pineapple on it though, but it tasted just like cold, canned pineapple tidbits. Just an okay taco.  Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold. The tortilla and filling felt like it came out of the fridge. Maybe because they put some sort of coleslaw on top, and then wrap it up. No matter, it was a cold turnoff. I only ate 1 bite, and the shrimp itself was tasty.  Side of rice/beans- The whole pinto beans were VERY tasty and to me had more flavor than Chipotle. I only wish their rice was equally good. It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry. It touts that it is cilantro lime, but you could hardly see any specks of cilantro, and if their was lime juice detectable at all, it tasted artificial.  Desserts- This is important: their desserts are AMAZING. As good of a warm churro as any you'd hope to eat. While the tacos were lukewarm at best, somehow the churro stayed hotter than anything else, and I ate it last. Very good!! I think it was supposed to come with chocolate and it didn't, but who cares?! Then there is the Espresso Flan, an unusual idea. It was delicious and unique, easily the tastiest thing we ordered from Brushfire!  So, overall I would say 3-3.5 stars for food, but due to its convenient location and novel concept I gave it 4 stars. You should definitely give Brushfire a try; as far as I know it's the first location in Arizona. I'd love to see Peoria as the home to more restaurant debuts like this! I hope they work out some of the kinks, most importantly: not overcooking rice and meats, and serving food at the proper hot temperature. So if you're look for a fast way to satisfy your taco craving that is a step up from Filiberto's, but yet not quite to the execution level of Chipotle, give Brushfire a try!",

They were phenomenal! As for the comments about portion size, I can only speak for our meals and they were giant and well worth the price! The drive thru worked just fine. Our order came out exact and customer service was great! Maybe the veggie meals weren't as good, I'm not sure but we are definitely looking forward to going back!  Overall the flavor was great, it was fresh as you could see them making it behind the window and the portions (at least for our meals) were very large for the price! This place will only get busier!",

Was a bit disappointed by the tacos, I expected bolder layers but then when cooking for the public it's hard to really indulge as one would otherwise. I am pretty sure the chef pulled a punch or two on these and would like to know what he would do them when cooking for himself.  Empenada was outstanding. Can't say enough.  Crochetas were one of those rare experienceso that teach you something new, really quite amazing. Layers were just right, varied and bold, I loved them. The star of the show if you know what you are looking for. Great job chef.  Service was friendly, people there are just great.  Particularly love the architecture. Shipping containers. Just brilliant. Looks cool AF and Earth friendly.",

I had a chicken taco with verde sauce that was good (and definitely better than Taco Bell) but I had to add a $2.50 chicken empanada and a $3 fried ham croquette order. The chicken empanada was very good and was perfectly cooked. The croquettes, however, we're very small and mushy.  I liked the concept but for street tacos, I would expect them to be lower priced. I can get 3 tacos from a standard brick and mortar Mexican restaurant for $10 and not walk away hungry - but the drive through convenience is nice.",

I was still hungry as I hadn't eaten much that day so I went back up to the window and ordered a bean & cheese burrito (tip: ask for queso fresco in your burrito!!!). It was so yummy!

The chips are good but I dont care that much about chips. The steak taco was good but the tiny diced steak was disappointing and the sizing is odd. Bigger than a street taco but not huge. 1 taco will not fill me for long but they aren't priced to be buying multiples. The Chicken empanada was spicy and interesting. Also ordered churros.

They come with chips, salsa, and a drank.   Things I like--I like the idea of their steak burritos. The ingredients and the portions of them are done correctly. You don't feel like they're skimping on the protein. You feel full when you're done, but not the same kind of full that leads you to taking a nap for the next two hours.   Things I don't like--I think they could improve how they season their meat and rice (i.e. seasoning their steak at all). I think the salsa isn't offensive but is watery and playing it too safe. Something that's got a 4 out of 5 on your heat scale shouldn't taste like tomato juice that came into brief contact with a lone pepper.   Things that absolutely make me LOL--They actually marketed tacos are \"tapas\". It's dumb, but I am kinda happy such a modest place like this did that before some $40-a-plate mediocre tex mex place in Old Town or Downtown beat them to it. If Brushfire did this ironically, I would have given them five stars and just doted on that while barely even touching my food opinions.   In the end, I'm still happy to see new independent Mexican spots open up. I just don't want them to be afraid of flavor and spice. I hope they continue to thrive and improve.",

I threw both of them out.  The burrito was pretty good; I got a shrimp burrito even though I thought I was taking a huge risk on either too little or crappy shrimp. Luckily neither was an issue.   I'm willing to try the tacos or another burrito next time, but I would advise to skip the tapas.",

We only received one empanada which was sad, because it was a pretty good empanada. The steak burrito was just an average burrito.  We also tried the shrimp taco, pork taco and chicken taco. The pork taco was the best out of the three, but I felt like they were all pretty small. The flavors were interesting, but not astonishing.   The hottest salsa was good (wildfire, I believe), but the others weren't that special. The chips were fine but saltier than I'd like.  The service may bring me back to try it again.",

    "text": "If there's one thing I've learned by living in Arizona all these years, it's that no two Mexican restaurants are exactly alike. That's a good thing if you love adventure, especially when you run across a gem like Brushfire Tacos Y Tapas because there is literally no place like it.   Before I get into the review, I should tell you what I think makes good Mexican food. I love fresh ingredients, unique combinations and interesting flavors. I have friends who judge Mexican food strictly by heat - but I'd rather taste everything I'm eating. I'm not trying to prove my tongue is made of cast iron, I want to take my time and taste every ingredient in every bite. And of course, great customer service is a must because it can make a good meal a really great experience.   That's what I like about Brushfire. It's a tiny little drive thru restaurant that's really unique. I think it's actually designed out of old shipping containers and I thought that was pretty cool. It's small with a walk up window and a couple of stone picnic tables in the back for seating. It's not the typical \"taco stand\" that we see on every street corner in the Valley. It's a little more upscale and you'll see that in the menu offerings, the fresh ingredients and on the times I've visited - in the friendly customer service.   With a menu that features tacos and tapas, you'd probably expect it to be in a nicely decorated, traditional, sit down restaurant. But this is more sidewalk fare, sold mostly a la carte and served in styro containers and cups. Like I said, it's a little different.   So, in reading some of the earlier reviews, I can see how some people are thrown by this place. If you're expecting a typical \"taco stand\" the prices will be a little higher and if you're expecting a traditional dining experience, you might be put off by sitting outside or eating out of a takeout bag. I have to admit, I wasn't sure what to expect on my first visit but to me, Brushfire is really the best of both worlds.  Tacos run about $3.50 each but even in a styrofoam package, this food looks and tastes amazing! (How they make a taco look appetizing in a styro container is an art in itself!) Lots of fresh ingredients and subtle flavors make each bite one to savor. If you're a first timer - start with a flight and try the empanadas - a light flaky deep friend pocket of chicken and veggies, served over a bed of lettuce and sour cream with spicy mayo on the side. You may be tempted to customize your order but on your first visit, try going with everything as described because these are subtle flavor combinations that really go together. A flight includes a drink and chips and your choice of salsa (try the Verde a medium salsa with an avocado base or the Brushfire medium salsa for a little more kick) for about $7.50 - $8.00.  Most adults will want a couple of tacos, especially if you want to explore the menu. I've tried the pork served \"el pastor\" bbq style with pineapple, pico and cheese. Add a little of their Wildfire or Inferno salsa if you want to bring the heat but try one bite without first to see what's going on inside the flour tortilla. Same goes for the chicken taco, marinated in cilantro-lime, grilled, served with pico, cheese and some really great guacamole. Each came with a slice of lime on the side. Perfecto! Other taco options include shrimp, veggie and steak but I love the pork and chicken so much, I'm having a hard time getting to those - maybe on my next visit?   If you're a light eater, you can get by on a flight, chips and a drink but if you're like me and get caught up in sampling all the options, you can expect to spend over $10 for two tacos, a little tapas, chips/salsa and a drink. I'm hoping in the future they come up with options for two taco or even a three taco flight - to help customers really have fun with the menu.  If you have the kids in tow, there are menu options for them ranging from some of the tapas offerings from the croquettas (ham and cheese croquettes) the kids burrito or quesidilla. Don't forget to save room for the churros with choco dipping sauce on the side.   That being said, this place won't be for everyone but seriously, you can say that about every Mexican place in Arizona. Ask any three people what their favorite Mexican restaurant is and you'll get three different answers. That's one of the perks of living here so get out there and start trying new places!  Traditional taco stands will still have their legions of fans who carry hot sauce in their glove box. Those nice traditional Mexican places will still enjoy their customers that want to make a night of it. But for me, this place does the trick. And judging by the continuous line in the drive thru on our visits, the word seems to be getting around. Glad to see people coming out to support local restaurants!",

I swoon for the adobado pork, which includes juicy bits of pineapple, spicy peppers, and cotija cheese in a flour tortilla. If you want corn tortillas instead, ask.   Other tacos include chicken, carne asada, shrimp, and veggie, which has roasted peppers, red potatoes, mushrooms, and other bits. Tacos can also be upgraded to burritos, bowls, or added to a flight.   Flights include your entree, fresh chips and your choice of five fresh salsas, a tapas and drink...and they not only have coke zero, they also have decent unsweetened iced tea.   Tapas options seem smaller recently, but are still crunchy bliss. I love the shrimp, like the croquetas and empanadas, and haven't tried the roasted potatoes.   Service is speedy and super friendly. This is a eat in the car sort of place, so ask for extra napkins and just relax. You may just want to drive thru again for churros or flan.",

I got the steak taco (with the guac or pico as I'm not a fan of jalapenos).   Steak was wonderfully season, a little queso added and I opted for a corn tortilla.  I am hooked.  Also got an order of their tortilla chips...so tasty.  They make them right there daily and season them with fresh lime juice and little salt.  Excellent.

I've tried chicken pork and beef taco and every time the meat is always overcooked and they just aren't that flavorful. I tried a side of rice and beans this week and it was so bland and blah, I didn't take more than 3 bites before throwing it out. Tapas on the other hand is good and could be great if it was consistent. I've had the croquettas a number of times because when they're good, they amazing but 3 or 4 times they have tasted like nothing.  Service has always been pretty good, everyone is always super friendly and wait times don't seem to be that bad. The one time I did call my order in, the sides of salsa and sour cream were left out.  Its a great concept, I just wish the tacos, rice and beans were better because this could be such a simple solution to those nights where coming up with an idea for dinner seems nearly impossible.",

Unfortunately the last time I was there I bit into my shrimp taco to find a long thing piece of metal in my mouth, like a large piece of a staple. So glad I didn't swallow i notified the workers and they handled it very well, apologized profusely and gave me a refund and a free order..not sure if I'll be going back soon though. Their breakfast burritos are amazing if you can get there early enough.",

The portions were smaller than what you'd get at other places but that's fantastic if you ask me! Americans overeat to a frightening degree and a place that serves high quality fast food that's healthy!? Sigh me up!  Chicken was all white, tender and tasty with a white cheese crumbled on top. It came with pico which I got on the side. The salsa (I got two fire) was pleasantly hot, left a nice burning tingle for a few seconds after eating it but didn't make me want to run for a glass of milk, just how I like it. The unsweetened tea I got was good too, too often when I buy it it's really watered down but no problem here!  I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone with the warning of 'smaller portions, slightly expensive but you're money is going towards quality not quantity!'",

    "text": "Spanish-Mexican fusion?! Yes.  Don't have to ask me twice as I have a special interest in Spanish cuisine.  With this fusion, you get fast service, but at a cost of quality.  This brick and mortar business should have gone the food truck route as the menu would easily fit the bill.  Instead, they operate inside a small, narrow building similar to one you see at Dutch Bros. Coffee.    Let's not judge the book by its cover right? The menu is basically either a la carte or you can do a combo or \"flight.\"  The flight gets you 2 tacos of your choice + 1 tapa + 1 chips/salsa + 1 drink = approx $8.  What I enjoyed the best were their carne asada tacos.  The beef was cooked well, decent charred flavors.  As for tapa, I went with the chicken empanada which was mediocre at best.  In fact, everything was quite mediocre or below average, from the chips and salsa to croqueta, which is deep fried potato with ham.  The salsas were a big disappointment.  Lacked authenticity it seemed.  I assumed when your salsa has habanero in it, it be spicy and hot, yet all it did was cool my tongue! #fail   One area that needs improvement in is in the food.  Service was nothing extraordinary.  Would I make a return, probably not.  It was worth a first try.  I really wanted it to stand out since I'm big into Spanish but it fell 2-stars short.",

Got to try their horchata it's a must and only .50 to refill. The staff are all super sweet and welcoming, amazing customer service always!   Here are some tips when ordering. I've read a lot of reviews saying their tacos are too small and over priced, well I totally agree! Instead get the burrito, it has the same ingredients and they're about 4 times bigger than the tacos and only cost a little more. They are big enough for two ppl or save half for later.  Here are some suggestions for brushfire that I think customers would appreciate... Please put a handwashing sink outside the restroom. I ordered my food and just wanted to wash my hands before I ate and there was an employee occupying the only restroom you have foreverrrrrr. Plz plz plz maybe serve the salsas in smaller side cups so you don't have to charge. So very tacky for any restaurant to charge for sauce or salsas. Last but not least I've read a lot reviews saying their food was cold. Seems like the tortillas are not heated but served cold. Heat them up and it'll keep them tacos and burros nice and toasty!!",

If we do, its usually something along the lines of uncooked potatoes or non-melted cheese. There's also been countless times where our salsas - that we paid for - were forgotten.   We have just waited in line for almost an hour, and the drive thru only had about six cars and a few guests seated outside. I've worked in fast food for years, and I know it isn't this challenging to serve customers in an adequate time.   Also, who charges 5 dollars for ONE taco?   There's one worker here who's insanely sweet, and this has nothing against her. We love her every time we've been served by her. We are just really tired of the lack of consistency for the price we pay.",

    "text": "Last week, I got some coffee at Dutch Bros, and parked in the lot right behind Brushfire.  I had a view of their menu and saw that they had breakfast tacos.  I'm always down with tacos, so I told myself that I would return.  Well, after dropping my mother in law off at the airport, I decided to stop by and sample their breakfast tacos.    I went with one of each.  I ordered a bacon, steak, chorizo and potato and egg taco.  I got all of them without the \"spicy mayo\".  Mayo should not be anywhere near a damn taco, IMO.  Anyways..........  $10.00 even, after tax for all 4.  Not bad!  Paid the lady at the window my money, she threw some salsas in my bag, I parked and dug in.  Here is how they were, favorite to least favorite....................  Chorizo-  This taco was bomb!  My favorite of the bunch.  Spicy chorizo, eggs, potatoes and cheese.  I threw some verde salsa on this thing and it was tasty!  5 star breakfast taco!  Bacon-  Same setup as the chorizo, but with bacon instead.  They chop up their bacon into almost a hash, and throw it in the taco.  I went with their Brushfire salsa on this one.  It was good.  Not as good as the chorizo, but I would get this one again.  4 star breakfast taco!  Egg and Potato-  Pretty much their veggie version.  No need to order this one unless you don't eat meat.  Same price, same ingredients just minus delicious bacon or chorizo ;-).  2 star breakfast taco!  Steak-  Meh, meh, super meh!  Their steak is not good, at all!  It was cubed up and it was incredibly chewy, gristly, and not seasoned well, at all!  Would never get one again, and it was some of the worst \"steak\" I have ever had at any type of restaurant.  Yeah, it was bad.  1 star breakfast taco!  Overall, I'm glad I tried them out.  Stick with the bacon and/or chorizo breakfast tacos and you will be fine.  I'm not racing back here, but if I had a breakfast taco craving, I'm sure I'll be back.  The tacos are pretty large and worth the $2.50 price point.  Service was friendly and quick.",

    "text": "Not good. Wanted to try this place for awhile, was hoping it would be a good place to get some fish tacos since most of the othet taco spots in the area dont have that.  This was not the place to get fish tacos or any other kind of tacos for that matter. I got 2 fish tacos and 2 carne asada tacos as well just to be safe. The fish tacos consist of super dryed out old chopped up fish filet mixed with the nastiest cole slaw ive ever seen. There is almost no fish to it, its mostly coleslaw, and the cole slaw is just gross. It literally looks like the guts of a lobster, pukish green and tatses strange.   The carne asada tacos were just as bad. Super dry and very much nothing special. Just about every other taco place within 5 miles of here is so much better than this. Its also kinda pricey, 24 bucks for 4 tacos that are a bit bigger than usual but do not taste good. If they are about 2x the size of regualr tacos i can still get 8 tacos that taste alot better and are cheaper right across the street.   Staff is very friendly, but that isnt enough. Ill stick with califia tacos and joes tacos instead.",

    "text": "My wife and I hit the drive-thru after running some errands at Lowe's yesterday.  Since moving to Peoria, I had been wanting to try this place.  It's good... not great.    The drive-thru is super convenient, but it is an absolute bitch to get in and out of... you have the cross-traffic coming at you that's entering and exiting onto Thunderbird.  Additionally, the parking lot that surrounds it is a complete clusterf*ck because of the overflow parking from Lowe's as well as the 99cent store and Sprouts.  If you opt to run the gauntlet and can successfully make your way to the entrance of the drive-thru, you're safe... but getting there is less than fun.  Like most shopping centers here in Arizona, there are simply too many businesses crammed into a tiny area.  My opinion, but that's how I feel.  Parking hazard aside, we both ordered a steak taco meal.  The drive-thru service was fast and our order was accurate.  There is no doubt that the taco was delicious... very good, but not the best I've had.  Let's face it.  We're in Arizona.  There a billion and one restaurants in a 25-mile radius at any given point in time where you can eat your fill in tacos.  It needs to absolutely blow my mind at this point in time and while Brushfire was delicious... it wasn't great.  For my tapas, I went with the shrimp en fuego which was basically frozen breaded shrimp.  The salsa was quite good though so I enjoyed that part of it!  In addition to that, they also give you a small portion of chips and salsa.  I really enjoyed the chips 'n salsa, as well!  Lastly, we were given a small drink.  $8.69 per steak taco meal seemed like a fairly good value given the amount of food we received.  I would say if you've never been to Brushfire and are hell bent on trying every taco joint here in the Valley - it is worth a visit to cross off your to-do list.  I don't personally think I'll be back.  The location is less than convenient AND there are just far better establishments to get a good taco here in the West Valley.",

    "text": "Santa knows if you skip Taco Tuesday.  So don't skip it, bruh.  On Taco Tuesday, they have a BOGO half off special and you can make one of those tacos a meal if you want.  My friend and I each got a BOGO taco with one as a meal.  He got steak taco with guacamole, pico salsa with his chips, and an empanada. I got the pork taco with pineapple, verde salsa with my chips, and an emanada.  I also got us a side of croquetas to share.  Our meals also came with a soda.    Since we each got the BOGO meal, we exchanged tacos so we got the chance to try more food.  I'm usually a sucker for al pastor tacos and while the pork taco had good flavor, it was sadly dry.  It looked insanely gorgeous in pictures and in person since it's so colorful but I enjoyed the juicy steak tacos more.  The verde salsa was the better of the two salsa as it had more flavor but it really didn't have any heat.  The empandas [pastry filled with chicken and veggies; spicy mayo, lettuce, sour cream] were good although a bit too salty and greasy for my taste.  My friend really liked them though.  As for the croquetas [potato balls with ham, cheese, and spicy mayo], which come six per order, these were tiny gumball sized potato balls which were great with the spicy mayo provided but easily nothing too memorable.  As I type this, I'm about to fall into a food coma.  It was a decent meal and I want to come back to try their breakfast.  The prices are on the higher side for a place with no indoor dining but the quality is there.  Decent eats for a decent price.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but I wouldn't say no to an invite for some Brushfire!",

    "text": "My sister called me from the parking lot and asked if I wanted to try something. I went with a pork bowl and an empanada. The bowl was okay, although the fresh pineapple in the pastor pork was a bit unusual. The cilantro-lime dressing was a nice balance to the spicy peppers, but the pork itself was overwhelmed by all the rest of the ingredients. Just not very flavorfully spiced, IMO. The empanada was good and the spicy mayo dip is really good. I need to reverse engineer it. I hear the breakfast options are good, so I'll have to go back to try them.",

The gal at the window was pretty friendly for an early Saturday morning. Especially given my orders are never straight forward/easy given I eat a mostly plant based diet. I ordered one veggie taco (no cheese) with a side of bushfire salsa and some chips and guacamole. Loved the variety of vegetables on the taco and the salsa was fantastic! The chips were deliciously light and crispy. The guacamole was good, but nothing special.  My friends tried a couple of other items too: - papas bravas: smelled delish and received 2 thumbs up - breakfast burrito with chorizo: received an \"it was ok\" response  Of the 5 of us dining, everyone enjoyed their meals and said they'd be back. Give it a try!",

We ordered carne asada tacos and pork tacos as well as an order of croquetas.   The tacos are served on flour tortillas, although you can request corn. They didn't skimp on the filling... My carne asada taco was overflowing with me that I scooped up with a fork. The pork taco was my favorite. The meat was flavorful and the pineapple added just the right amount of sweetness.  The croquetas were tasty, although I would have liked a little more ham.   Service was good even though we arrived 10 minutes before closing.

Nope it was chicken and horribly bland chicken at that. I called and went back to get the order corrected and received my steak burrito which I was hoping was better than the chicken I had tasted.   No dice the steak was just as bland, the pinto beans, bland, the white rice bland, and the guac bland as well. I should have known as soon as I tasted my horchata that this was not the place for me. Still have a free steak burrito but I will be leaving it there. No way am I going back I will stick with Chipolte and yes that is how I spell it and say it. Do yourself a favor bypass this place.",

    "text": "The first time my wife and I ate here, about a year ago, she got the bacon burrito and I got the chorizo. Man was that a mistake on my part. The chorizo was very dry and had a gritty texture to it. My wife's bacon burrito on the other hand was on point. One thing to note if you are eating here before 10:30 in the morning is that if you are looking for a wide variety of breakfast items you will not find it here. You've got your choice of a bacon or chorizo burrito, bacon or chorizo taco which is just a smaller version of the burrito or lastly you can get a bacon or chorizo bowl.   When I saw that there was a Groupon for this place I jumped on it, since I was still intrigued with my wife's bacon burrito, to give this place a second shot since it is a little on $$ side.   What I love most about this place is the spicy mayo. They put that stuff on almost everything and it is absolutely to die for, minus the chorizo. I generally stop here any chance I can on my way to work and pick up a bacon burrito with extra spicy mayo. The bacon burrito is by far the best breakfast item on their menu!   My wife and I have also tried their carne asada, aka steak, tacos which were very impressive for their price, but keeping in mind that you will probably buy two or three to fill up. You can also make this a flight where you will then add a tapas to your order, my personal recommendation is the shrimp en fuego which is absolutely to die for or you can go with the empanadas which are always cooked perfectly. Keeping in mind if you are big eater like myself you'll probably want to throw and extra taco in with your flight so you aren't left looking to snack when you get home.   Would I recommend these guys to friends or family visiting? Absolutely!   Personal side note: Although they give this a $ rating I would give them $$ rating because of how much you have to buy to fill up.",

The horchata was ok, nothing special the pico salsa was lacking flavor.  But the inferno salsa was devine! I put that on everything and it kicked it up a notch. It had me on fire   Overall it's good. Nothing special, I wanna try the burritos next time with a groupon. My husband didn't like that they pack their tacos individually, we got 10 tacos in 10 separate styrofoam containers.

I been wanting to try it for a while now and I did today their food is good it has flavor although that spicy mayo they put on everything and it over whelms their dish. Don't get me wrong it's good it's not bad but I had way to much of it on the steak breakfast taco which made me not taste so much of the rest and also my steak on the taco was good however it was over cooked. . Croquetas are not bad but they're super small. Size of a quarter . Staff IS super friendly so that helps them a lot. I think maybe if they came up with another sauce for their dishes they'll have a better outcome . I also tried their empanada. Not bad but then again they serve it with that spicy mayo dip which quite frankly I don't think it goes with the empanada. Now, I will come back and give them a second chance and try another item on their menu. Their food has flavor .",

Do yourself a favor and check this place out if in the area or looking for some flavorful tacos and tapas.  Whether you walk up or go thru the drive thru, be prepared to enjoy some great Mexican/Spanish tapas. This place could be on anyone's weekly go to list without hesitation.",

The first time was really good where everything was fresh and tasty.  The shrimp tacos were really good.  But the two times after we went back they were inconsistant.  It just wasn't as good.  I tried the chile lime rice and it was mush.  I think we'll try it again but only after they've been open a while and hopefully get more consistant.",

They have quick service and a little outdoor dining area that is best suited for cooler nights.  The only reason I couldn't give them five stars is because their service is not consistent.  One day we will get exceptional service and the other we will get someone who sees we are standing there and don't acknowledge us.  If their customer service was consistent they would earn five stars.",

They have added a steak breakfast burrito & taco to the menu, I'm so happy about that because I've been asking them to do that. Let me tell you, they did not disappoint. The burrito was so big I could only get my hand half way around it. This was now the second time I have gotten the burrito & so far it's consistent. The steak was very tender & no grizzle & it was loaded in the burro. It was also heaping with eggs & the spicy mayo & added pico puts it over the top. I have to note that the prices on all the burritos & tacos have increased but you get what you pay for. The burritos are now $4.29 & the tacos are $1.99. The only thing that I'm not happy about is that the sides of salsa have doubled in price, I think 50 cents is a bit high for 2 ounces of salsa, but you get your first one free with purchase.",

The flight includes a drink, chips and salsa, an entree and a side tapas. It might be because I ordered the bowl. I'm not sure how large the burritos or tacos are.  I don't know if I ate the food in the wrong order, or if I just shouldn't of eaten all of it. Make sure you ask all of what is in the bowl. The menu board is not clear and you'll be wondering what's on top. The bowl container is a lot deeper than you think it is and which makes this a heavy \"salad\".  I enjoyed it, but next time I'll just order the bowl and the papas fritas or the bowl with the chips and salsa. Oh yeah, the Papas fritas are great so you might want to save those for last or you might want to not want to eat the rest of your meal because you'll be thinking about eating more of those.",

My burrito was really bland and had no flavor except for a little sweet bite of pineapple every once in awhile. If I am going to spend 7 dollars on a burrito I will go up the street to Chipotle, at least that has flavor. I got their Brushfire salsa which has a flavor I don't care for (kind of plastic flavor). The girl taking the order was really nice and the fact they just opened I gave them 2 stars. I know sometimes it takes a little while to find your footing. Hopefully they will invest in some seasoning or at best some salt.",

Sure enough there must have been 6 maybe 7 little pieces of meat, and for some reason the tortilla was hard and broken. Come on, even my 7 year old knows flour tortillas should be soft and supple. These should be called street tacos and cut the tortilla size to 4 inches because that's all the meat that fits in it  I ordered fish tacos and I couldn't find the fish in the damn thing. There's a picture you decide for yourself where the hell the fish is. Absolutely pathetic, so this place gets two stars and they should be happy with that. However based on other reviews I will stop by for a breakfast burrito or tapas just to try something else out. But for now, their steak taco sucks and their fish taco is even worse.

The meat was so dry in my husbands pork tacos that he couldn't even eat it, the steak tacos we both got were okay, meat was dried out, decent flavor but it was just coated in guacamole, that's all we were really getting in each bite.  Chicken taco was my absolute least favorite, no flavor at all & once again, super dry, I couldn't finish it.

Decided to just try a carne asada taco today.  Actually pretty disappointed with it. Seemed overpriced at 4 bucks, but it could have been worth it if it had been done well. Really the whole taco was lukewarm, and tasted like it had been refrigerated previously and left out at room temperature maybe for a while. This was very confusing because I had to wait about 10 minutes to get it served through the drive-thru window when I was the only car in line. So I was expecting it to be fresh made, and for this price it should be. The meat seemed high quality, but again wasn't fresh and was somewhat congealed and semi tough and cold. If it had been served fresh off the grill, it probably would have been more tender and flavorful. Cold tacos? I think not.",

I figured at a Mexican Food place they would give you a couple free sides of salsa and expected to pay for the rest. Not here! I paid $4 for 4 sides of 2 oz salsas, .75 cents for some soggy mushrooms and pepper(wasn't expecting mushrooms) and $2.99 for a 2 oz side of guacamole.  Who charges extra for lettuce and peppers?  If a place is going to charge for some measly salsa and veggies they should at least let you know. Will never eat here again.",

I got a steak breakfast burrito. OMG this place is Awesome!!! This is the best breakfast burrito I have ever had, it has tons of cut up steak, spicy mayo, eggs, crispy potatoes. It was delicious, my only regret is that I've been passing by this place for so many years. I will definitely be telling my friends about this joint, and will be making this my regular morning burrito spot. Looked like they had a bunch of other stuff I'm excited to try.",

It also has the benefit or drawback (depending on how you look at it) of bring butt up again a very propular dutch bros location. No matter when you visit it is going to be busy af.   I got the bacon breakfast burrito. The tortilla was fresh and has a nice chew and texture. The eggs cheese and bacon has a nice mix to it but it was just a little r ok salty. Maybe that becuae it had plenty of delicious bacon. My homies got the tacos and was really hyping the sauce that came with it.   Not you are going to have to get your grub on in the car ladies and gentleman. There is no indoor denying experience so nothing much to say there.   Looks like they have special on Tuesday for a taco and tapas $5.   Ill be back.",

I have never in my entire life left a review for anywhere but this was so bad I have to let someone at this place know about how rudely I was treated. Me and my husband ordered 6 tacos, I requested wildfire sauce on mine. And we also requested limes. They forgot our limes like always, so I walked up to the window and asked for limes, the girl  gave them to me, didn't even apologize for forgetting something so simple. Every single time we come here which has been about 7 or 8 times, they forget the Limes we always ask for so of course they did this time too. But today, they also made my 3 tacos which i requested wildfire sauce on them with no sauce. So I walked up the window and asked them for a refund because I didn't want to deal with the headache of them messing up my order again. The manager, a Hispanic guy was extremely rude, he was smiling the entire time I was voicing my complaints and concerns over the fact that they repeatedly mess up my order. He then interrupted me and asked if he could take the person behind me's order without even offering a solution to my issue. You seriously have an upset customer, and your asking to brush her off so u can help out someone else instead. These people can care less if they make your order correctly right or not. They charge ALOT, 30 bucks for 6 tacos so yes I do expect my order to be correct but obviously these people especially the rude manager don't care at all. Please everyone reading this, save yourself the headache and go to Mcdonalds or Filibertos across the street. At least they practice customer service at those places.",

My second visit (today) I got a fish and shrimp taco, I was upset with my fish today bc it was SO salty I could hardly eat it. I ended up pulling some out of taco. I'm not sure if I need to order it differently or if it's a matter of who's cooking, bc my first fish wasn't nearly this salty.

When I had it, it was very overcooked.   The chicken tacos are yummy. They have juicy pieces of chicken with lettuce & pico de gallo, and guacamole.   The carne asada here is super good. I have no idea if it's \"authentic\", but it's super tasty. I've never had it overcooked.   My favorite thing here is the steak bowl. It's steak with rice & pinto beans, lettuce, pico de gallo, carne asada and I think roasted poblanos. It's been a little while since I've had one.   The wings have a great spicy sweet sauce. If they were a bit cheaper I'd get them more.   The fiery shrimp has breaded shrimp with the same sauce. So good.   The chicken empanada is good. It comes with lettuce & sour cream, and a spicy mayo to dip it in. The chicken is mildly spiced, with flecks of black pepper in it. It's literally just stuffed with chicken, but if they changed it, I wouldn't get it anymore.",

It's usually so busy and right next to Dutch brothers so when I saw it was slow today I jumped on my chance. I have never been there before so ordering for the first time was slightly confusing but I ordered the steak taco meal. I assumed it would come with more than one but surprisingly with the side of rice and chips and salsa I was actually full after eating it. I wish the cups were slightly bigger however I got tea and it was really good.        The guy at the window was very friendly and nice and I really enjoyed that he took the time to talk to us while our food was being bagged. I was excited to try this place after talking with him because he really seemed like he likes his job. I got home and the food really was very delicious. I will definitely be back if I can catch it on a slow day again.",

I don't get their menu. Food and sides don't go together really, and the whole thing just doesn't make sense to me. When we were ordering, it seemed as if we were bothering her, which was slightly awkward. Overall, not a good experience. Cool name, but not relative to the food at all. I'd say skip this place.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place.  That being said, not sure we will be going back.  It comes down to the customer service.  Breakfast burritos available until 10:30.  We walk up to the window and wait about 3-4 minutes and finally take a closer look inside (the windows are tinted to make sure someone is really in there). There weren't any cars in the drive thru and no one else outside..  We must have gotten their attention, a girl opens the window and says oh hi, sorry about the wait... I order a breakfast burrito and she tells me, oh we stopped making those about 2 minutes ago.... I nicely mentioned I was in line before that time, and she just repeats we stopped making those.  The end.   She seemed irritated after this so we just ordered other items off the menu.  She couldn't close that window soon enough it seemed after we ordered.  15 minutes later our order was ready.  Hopefully it doesn't take that long all the time.  I understand if it is the beginning of lunch it might take some time to get the lunch food out and prepared. Here is what we ordered and what we though of it. Empanadas- they were ok, about 4x3 so pretty tiny but they are only 2.49.  I don't think they were homemade there, but nonetheless, the crust was flaky. Croquetas- we didn't like them.  Not crispy, kinda mushy. Al Pastor burrito- Best Al Pastor we have ever had.   Carne Asada- It was ok, comparable to Chipolte.  4 stars for the Al Pasor 1 star for the service 3 stars overall.",

However, I went back yesterday and while the food was still good, the exact same meal cost me $2.50 more than my first visit. Not a deal breaker, but def not cool Brushfire. While I like the new styrofoam containers that prevent my taco from leaking salsa all over the bag, I'd rather save my $2.50 and deal with a messy taco. Bring back the cheap-o wrappers and the cheap-o prices :D please?",
