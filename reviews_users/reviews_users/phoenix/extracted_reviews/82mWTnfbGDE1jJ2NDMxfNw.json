They refilled my drink twice on top of the initial cost and it cost me 9 fucking dollars for some sprite.   On top of that my girlfriend ordered the pesto pizza, the menu in the store says \"+$2\" for chicken. I was charged double that.  Also, all the ingredients in the meals aren't listed on the menu, and the food was mediocre at best. Hard to eat, prepared slopily.   I wouldn't come back here if they gave me a coupon for 100% off my next meal. DO NOT GO TO THIS PITA JUNGLE!!!!",

I also must mention how superb our waitress was. A joyful person with excellent service skills. I believe her name is Rachel. But back to the food. I love the mahi mahi. It's yummy yummy!

Service is generally good and what can be expected from this type of restaurant. Last week we had small hummus as an appetizer, which was a nice little starter to our lunch. I had the falafel pita and a side of beans. My lunch partner had the vegetarian burger with garlic roasted potatoes. The pita was good, although I don't like the added pickles (i forgot to ask to not include them) and had to ask for the tahini sauce, which normally comes with it. The beans were very good. Nice flavor, vegetarian, more of a stew really. My partner enjoyed the burger, but commented that it was a tad bit too spicy for him, and he loves hot Indian food. Overall a nice alternative to fast food and decent service.",

Though it doesn't match the names plate over at India Oven, it is still on point, here it jus feels healthier and lighter. The portion is very plentiful too.

He took the dish, and reappeared moments later with some hummus and pita chips, and brought perfectly done fish back in a few minutes. While waiting we noticed he was not only directing his staff, but was himself busing tables, checking orders, and visiting customers.

The food is still awesome, and the servers are nice, helpful, and courteous... but the location is DIRTY.   They desperately need to repaint. The walls have coloring on them, cracked paint, and what looks like food stuck to the walls. It's gross, and I avoid this location now, to go to the one in Dana Park, which is much (aesthetically/hygienically) cleaner. Don't get me wrong - the staff are awesome, the bartender is great, and I've always had amazing food here.  It's just that they definitely need to clean up the place a bit. I'd happily bump this back up to a four or five star if they do so.  They also have music on Sunday nights, usually an acoustic small band or solo artist. Nice touch to get people in -- but a repaint would work wonders.",

    "text": "Oh my! I cannot believe that I had never experienced all they have to offer. To be honest many people had told me that they liked Pita Jungle . But, they never told me the True details. For some reason I just never thought I needed to go here. But, my friend was here visiting from Denver and she said that she wanted to go there as there were none in Denver. I agreed to go. How bad could it be, plus I had never been there before. We drove past the one on University, But there is never anywhere to park over there ,so I said , \"let's go to the one on Southern\". I drive by it all the time. Anyway, long story short. It was beautiful outside on this day, so we sat on the Patio, which was really nice. Our server was an amazing young man, who was happy to answer all our questions, even though he was also very busy. His name was David and he was wonderful. The food was absolutely divine! Every piece of it. I had Coconut Curry soup, which was magical ,just a cup which was a large serving. I also got Hummus with Ahi Tuna. It was made to perfection. My friend got Broiled Chicken Pita,which she said was divine as well!We also shared a Spanakpita which was amazing.  The food here is wonderful! I cannot believe that I had waited so many years to visit it. Proving that things may not always be what you think. So you should always give everything a good try. Bathrooms were clean and so was the restaurant inside and out on the Patio as well. Lots of nice parking.",

I'd highly recommend this location to anyone out there that might have had a bad experience in the past. They'll treat you like family.",

Will try again for sure..",

The food isn't terrible, it was okay tasting and did seem on the healthier side. But take the Pita out of it, it's just not Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food. Perhaps you can say it is to mediterranean food what Taco Bell is to Mexican food. Again, no issues with the place. The food was ok, and the service was fine. I guess what threw me off was the \"pita\" in their name.",

You would think the takeout crowd would cause your wait to be twenty minutes or more for food around prime lunch rush times, but I've ordered at the restaurant and only waited ten minutes at noon. It's a little confusing if you just want to order food to go (go to the bar!), but the bartenders and hosts are always so kind. I was in the middle of my order and the girl taking it received a phone call which she said she had to take. Working in service, I know this stuff happens, so I waited patiently for her to resolve the problem. I may have waited four minutes, but she decided to comp my appetizer for the \"inconvenience.\" Entirely unnecessary but very much appreciated. Not to mention, the food is awesome. Vegetarians and vegans alike can find something delicious at Pita Jungle!",

People I take to Pita jungle always fall in love with the place. the few drawbacks are they are few and far between, service is spotty because my husband complains \"you can't tell which person works here or is eating here.\", and the wait can be long at standard meal times or weekends. It saved by yumm food, an amazing oven, and did I say really good food yet?  This place in particular is nice because my mother works nearby and she is  always up for some Baba Gannoush and some talk. We split that and I have not had anything bad there yet. We've had the nachos, the happy hour, pesto pizza minus the feta add chicken and garlic, the turkey pesto wrap, the pitas, the hummus, the bbq chicken pizza for my personal trainer, chipotle chicken pizza for the hubby, and the mahi mahi for my friends. Everyone can find something here to eat and that's nice when you have a bunch of people together with differing appetites. I didnt come here for a long time because i was scared off by the Mediterrrenean description. This place is not some gyros and that's it kind of place. Pita Jungle has a huge selection and it's specials are great.  You will enjoy this place if you are a picky eater, like a variety of food, or if you just plain like to eat. Pita Jungle is a great place to take friends and family and enjoy the ambiance, people watching, good drinks ( could use more of a selection), and great food!",

I always buy an extra pint of the lemon vinaigrette sauce because it is my favorite dressing. I was there monday and the guy at the bar refused to sell me a pint he was hesitant saying that what they gave me in the salad was more than enough, like if he knows how much i need. I use it for other salads that i make at home. He told me to hold on while he asked his boss then while i was waiting for him he took a phone order and again he says that was more than enough and that they were on a low supplyof lemon vinaigrette. Like seriously dude im trying to purchase it i am not asking for it for free. I told him i have bought it before yet he didnt seem to care and said that suddenly they stopped doing that which i think is a bunch of bull. I just think that is very poor customer service youre not going to tell a customer how much is enough if they are paying.",

So does this mean the next time I come in I have to run through all of my favorites to find out what changed? How are your regulars suppose to know. That was just a bad experience. My pizza was weeping  balsamic dressing. ....that is rediculous. The waitress said the menu changed....I wonder if that is the case. Also there was siracho on every table. I asked the waitress to take it away because this used to be an item you asked for....I had no idea that was part of the regular decor.....needless to say she wasn't too happy when I asked it to be removed....I figured it out later when I looked around. That explains her annoyance that I asked...oh well...",

    "text": "Friday Oct. 18th      I normally don't go to this location but I was in Mesa and was in the mood for something healthier then not. It only took the host, who I later found out was the manager, 5 or so minutes to seat me. I usually get the same thing when I go to any PJ because it's easy for me to log my calories, a green tea and a mozzarella tomato with basil. Today I thought it would be nice to treat myself to a little dessert, but I had never gotten dessert at PJ before and I honestly didn't know what they had. This is where things went sour. The manager had been going around talking to tables and when he came by me I asked him for a dessert menu. He smiled in what, in retrospect, was a rather condescending way, and told me I didn't need a dessert menu because HE knew exactly what I wanted, something called a \"sopa-pita\". He explained that it was apples, almond butter, vanilla ice cream, and caramel all on a greek pita. Yeah it sounds good, it also sounds very calorie and fat packed and since I come to PJ because it's the \"art of eating healthy\" I declined and asked for a menu again. He told me that I didn't know what I was missing and walked away, straight up to the server that was taking care of me. Now I obviously cant know for sure what he told the server, but less then a minute later the check was on the table and the server was thanking me for coming in. The manager KNEW that I wanted a dessert menu and interacted with the server before I did. It became VERY clear that not only was he only interested in pushing this one dessert item but that he was not interested in taking care of anyone who wasn't \"biting\". I know I could have asked the server for the menu, he was a very sweet guy and I know it wouldn't have been a problem. But I was so shocked with the managers behavior that I honestly lost my appetite. If I am ever in Mesa and craving PJ again I will take the extra time to drive to Tempe or Chandler. Oh and I looked it up just now on Pita Jungle's webpage, there is NO dessert menu item called a \"sopa-pita\".",

The funny thing is, after 4 days in NYC, I only had one memorable meal, but living in the Phoenix area, I have my choice of wonderful establishments to have a delicious and memorable meal 3 times a day if I wish!  Pita Jungle is a family owned restaurant that has been around for what seems like forever.  They started out in Tempe, and have exploded in the last few years to include Scottsdale, Phoenix, Mesa, and Chandler.    If the crowds are any indication, this place is good!  But let me warn you, not everyone in your party will like it.  If you're into artery clogging, fried foods or bar foods, then Pita Jungle is not for you.  Pita Jungle serves some of the freshest, and healthiest food in the valley.  I believe they originally started out to be vegetarian, not sure, but there is something on the menu for everyone, including meat!  One of my favorites is the Caribbean Salad; a gorgeous and colorful, mouthwatering display of the most beautiful fruit you have ever seen in your life!  There's pineapple, oranges, strawberries, apples, and more!    But beware!  The servings at Pita Jungle are huge!  A plate is usually enough for 2 people, if not more!  I can only eat about 1/4 of the Caribbean salad and then take the rest home.  The restaurant is comfortable and clean, decorated kind of artsy, and modern.  If I had one complaint, it would be the one-seat ladies room!    Pita Jungle is my favorite place to take my girlfriends to lunch, since we all like fresh and healthy food.  My husband is more of a hamburger or meat and potatoes guy, this type of food just doesn't rock his world.    Anyway, if you love healthy, fresh food, salads, pita sandwiches, vegetarian, chicken wraps, and hummus, you'll love Pita Jungle!  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Before I moved away 5 years ago, Pita Jungle was one of the last spots I HAD to have before I departed. It was always one of my favorites. As I was driving down Southern yesterday, wandering aimlessly through the city trying to find my way around again, I stumbled upon a new Pita Jungle location that wasn't here before, and, immediately flipped the car around and found the shadiest spot possible.   The decor is simple and very open, lots of windows and funky paintings on the wall. I remember the Chandler and Tempe locations being a little cluttered, but I suppose things have changed. We started with the falafel platter, which consists of 5 crispy chickpea croquettes on a bed of greens, they were cooked perfect and the flavor was great. I opted for the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap - Grilled chicken breast, tomatoes, onions, and garlic sauce, wrapped in lavosh bread and wood-fired, served with a greek salad. It was delicious, exactly as I remembered. I also had a mango-banana-pineapple smoothie, which was awesome and super refreshing on a hot day. The waitstaff were friendly and helpful and had everything out and ready within a reasonable time frame.   The fact that this place has an open kitchen totally does it for me. I love it when I am able to watch the chefs prepare my food, and see how they maneuver around their kitchen.   No complaints from me, I have and always will love Pita Jungle.",

    "text": "You'd think it would be difficult for a local chain to provide a consistently great dining experience across several stores, but I've eaten at four different Pita Jungle locations and every experience has been excellent.   For starters, no visit to Pita Jungle is complete without the roasted bell pepper hummus (they'll even serve it with veggies instead of bread upon request). The four-cheese spinach quesadilla is also delish.  I pretty much always order a pita as my main event (it is, after all, *Pita* Jungle) -- the chicken shawarma and Philly chicken are top picks. The tuna and veggie salads are great choices for the \"no bread\" crowd, and if you're craving a wrap, the spicy chicken is the way to go.  The only downside? Every location tends to be busy, particularly during lunch. But that's what happens when the food is this good -- other people have an annoying way of discovering it. Service is speedy and friendly, and the prices are really reasonable.",

    "text": "What? Nothing with grease?   My wife and I drove by the Mesa Pita Jungle today and decided to stop by. This is not a place I would normally visit. I like meat, pizza and all of the other unhealthy things you can think of. But we were in the mood for Mediterranean food, and had little time to drive around.   Last time I was in Pita Jungle was back in the 1990's. So, for me, this was almost like my first visit, and for my wife it was really her first visit. I'm so glad we stopped here.   The focus here, of course, is on healthy Mediterranean cuisine.So, there are a few key items missing from the typical Mediterranean menu. But what Pita Jungle does it does very well indeed.   I had the chicken shawarma pita, the closest thing to my normal unhealthy diet I could find. My wife had the Mediterranean plate. We shared both.   Lots stood out here. The baba ganoush was, perhaps, the best I have ever had--certainly right up there. The falafel was also outstanding. My chicken shawama was also very, very good. Everything was good, but those three really stood out as superb.   Service was also outstanding. We were seated outside and not neglected in the least. Food was on the table in minutes. Just great.  I started to give Pita Jungle four stars because I don't want people to think I'm an easy grader. But the food was great, service was great, the atmosphere was even nice, though we were outside next to the parking lot. I have to go with five.",

The Beef Gyro had a pickle on it, which we thought was strange, but it WORKED, YUM!  It was on a nice soft flat bread with beautiful greens topping it.  The Falafel was on a toasted/almost crispy pita and was flavorful as can be.  Also with beautiful greens and a delicious tahini based sauce.  the kids plate was amazing, no blue boxed stuff here...delicious tangy grilled lemon chicken, homemade mac'n'cheese, really green, fresh beautiful broccoli, and a side of fresh fruit with a drink for $4.95  The Carrot cake=moist and delicious, but I probably would leave the caramel sauce off. It actually worked with the cake, but was a little too sweet for my tastes.    The service was a teensy bit slow, but it was very busy today, probably because of the extensive vegetarian list and Ash Wednesday being the day of our vist. But that said, the service was also attentive and friendly.  Decor was fun and funky, very bohemian, so were the staff there.  Loved it.",

If I had just visited this location and no other PJ restaurants, I would probably give this one at least 4 stars. However, after visiting at 2 other locations since then, I'd say that this Mesa PJ wasn't the best.  Our waitress was very nice. We ordered a Pita Pizza, with Glazed-Chicken Lavosh Pizza I believe. While ordering, our friend started a huge conversation with the waitress about how evil onions are, and how we would not like onions on our pizza at all. The waitress decided to join our impromptu anti-onion club and everything! However, once the pizza came... there were tons of onions all over. We don't have anything against onions, but our friend hates them. They took the pizza back and made us a new one, but we were a bit disappointed with the entire situation.   The rest of the food was good, although I don't really remember what we ordered. The pizza, once cooked to our specifications, was quite delicious! Overall, not a bad experience, but when compared to other locations I am now a bit disappointed.",

Both the food and the experience were excellent.  I had the Chicken del Sol (a Southwest style chicken cooked with diced tomatoes, garlic, black beans, and sweet corn), which comes with a chipotle cheddar pita crisp.  The chicken itself was better than most, but what really made the meal was the chipotle cheddar pita.  It complimented the dish perfectly.  Perhaps most surprising were the portion sizes, given the relatively low cost.  I did not expect to have so much food.  Serving eight people is difficult for anyone, but the waitress handled our party's size decently well.  The only mistake we had was an incorrectly-prepared dish, which the staff replaced without a fuss.  It is the only thing keeping my review from being five stars.  We've already made plans to go back...",

The second bad experience was when they brought us the wrong food. Bringing chicken to my vegan friend never ends up well for him or for the wait staff who has to bear the brunt of his fury. The third bad experience happened on the last visit. Dirty cups. Gross.  The food is the same as other locations. Mostly delicious, but often the food is inconsistent. The potatoes are usually tasty, but always come out to varying degrees of doneness. Same with the lentil soup, sometimes it's thick, sometimes its thin.

I just got home and crawled into bed and was trying to drift off to sleep but couldn't. I kept thinking about the 3 star review I gave this location just earlier today.   Tonight we had a totally different experience at this Pita Jungle location. We sat ourselves, shortly after our server made her way to our table. She was very friendly and quick. She took our order immediately, brought our order out within 5 minutes of us placing it and filled up our water glasses so often they never reached the halfway point.   It doesn't stop there either. My dinner companion wasn't sure about the Chicken Shawarma that he ordered. For some reason he thought that the \"red sauce\" was missing. According to the server and the menu there was no such sauce... It then became the mystery sauce. Our waiter was so concerned about him enjoying his meal that she checked with him several times to see if he wanted something else.   At the end of our evening, without our request our server brought us our check and low and behold, she had removed the Chicken Shawarma from our ticket. Talk about service. We were so impressed that we made sure to thank her in the form of dolla' bills.   I changed my mind about this location. I'll happily be back after such a positive experience tonight. Hopeful we get the same waitress that we had, next time.   P.S. I got the hummus again, just as delicious as always. This time I requested that they bring a big bowl of cucumbers and tomatoes instead of pita bread. You should have seen the size of the bowl they brought out! Wow. I am a happy and full girl!",

    "text": "What Pita Jungle does, it does well. The food and service are consistent. What stands out for this location is how much more comfortable it is (both in the restaurant and in the parking lot) compared to locations on Ray, Shea, Apache Blvd, or Indian School. At this location you can be assured that: 1) you'll find a parking spot immediately 2) your server will pay attention to you (I'm talking to you, Ray location) 3) the next table of people won't be so close that you get elbowed  Pita Jungle has succumbed to the huge portion fad, so order carefully or you'll end up with far more food that you need. I have found that they are willing (especially at this location) to make smaller versions of the dishes, so if you want two pieces of dolma or a half of a fruit platter, just ask.  My favorite dishes are the babaganoush and the falafel. The platters are good but far too big for one person, so find someone to share. This is especially a problem with the fruit and cheese platter, which I refer to as the Matterhorn of fruit. I tried the Chicken Putanesca once; it was good, but too oily and the chicken was a bit dry. The Gambas con Ajo, on the other hand, was excellent, with its spicy marinara and perfectly cooked jumbo shrimp.  This location is always clean, including the bathrooms. There is also a pseudo-bar area (do they serve alcohol?) with a lot of seating, so if you happen to arrive while the restaurant is full, you'll have somewhere nicer than a parking lot to wait.",

We start off with the Roasted Cauliflower in Tahini sauce; I loved the sauce, and the crispy onions with the cauliflower was the perfect pair. I decided I needed some Tzatziki sauce with pita, and needed to try an item off the Seasonal Kitchen Crafts Menu (think super-foods!) so we chose the chili. Both tasted fresh and awesome! We added Pita Jungle's specialty hot sauce (try the green one!) to give the chili extra kick. For entrees, we ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala - the coconut sauce was creamy and delicious- as well as the Roasted Garlic and Portobello Pizza, which tasted healthy and light. I enjoyed every bite, and soon both dishes were gone. Finally, we ate the Chocolate Dipped Walnut Baklava Rolls, which for a sweet tooth like me, is just plain heavenly! Pita Jungle definitely lived up to its reputation of delivering healthy food.",

My husband had a Mediterranean salad with fire roasted chicken and said it was good.  Mine however was a big disappointment.  When I asked the server if this was a mistake and that fire roasted chicken was used and she said no it was the Med. chicken shawarma.  I indicated it was not shawarma.  She mentioned it to the manager who came over to us and said that all the chicken was fire roasted.  I said then it isn't really Authentic Shawarma and he said no.  I was very disappointed.  So if you are looking for authentic shawarma, dont go to Pita Jungle.  They should change their menu.",

I love that everyone is an individual here. You're never struggling to remember who your server is because everyone is in the same lame tshirt and black pants. The service was quick and the drinks were tasty. I got a Philly cheese steak pita and it was good. My boyfriend got the chicken pita (the garlic paste/sauce is yum)  This place is pretty good.

About 8 mins later another couple was seated, we waited and waited to place our food order. I observed her go back to the table with the couple,  take their order and not come back to us. I stopped another employee and placed my order with him. She finally came back around and by that time I was already irritated.

    "text": "We have been going to Pita Jungle for about 12 years and started at the first one on apache blvd. Since moving to Tempe we have been steady customers at the Mesa location the food is excellent, however, the restaurant in Mesa we have noticed has been on a tremendous down hill slide for the last several months. The chairs are half broken and when we go I have to always remove chairs  from our table for fear of falling and cracking my head on the floor. We keep asking why aren't the chairs replaced? What has motivated me this evening to write this review is the air conditioning system has been broken for several days ( we were at the restaurant earlier this week for a pickup and was advised it was inoperable at that time). 3 days later we experience the same event. We wanted to leave  but our outstanding waiter Jeremy moved us to where a fan was in operation to help us stay. During the time while we were dining we heard all the dehydrated staff at the restaurant informing the small amount of people who braved this dining experience at least 113 degrees be advised of the same situation. It is a shame  that the owners of Pita Jungle have become rude and uncaring about the people who have loved and frequented this restaurant to  be treated in such a callous and unconcerned manner. Thankfully waiters like Jeremy are responsive to the degree they can be, maybe the owners should begin to take lessons from their quality people before a lawsuit occurs. This is due to their unwillingness to improve the quality of the chairs. We would recommend McDonald's to look at the quality of their chairs and the importance of maintaining a standard that Pita Jungle ownership so sorely lacks.",

    "text": "Not sure how to even start this review off because I'm so disappointed. I've been to this location 3 times. The first was memorable because our waiter not once checked on us to make sure we were doing okay, and we had to catch his attention when we were ready for our check. The second time was decent, but our waitress only checked on us once. The last time, today, is very memorable. I ordered some food online to pick up for a friend and myself. I walked into the door and waited next to the hostess area for 6 minutes (I timed it actually). Finally, a man came up to me and asks, \"can I help you with something?\". Okay. Yes I was there for a pick up but he didn't even ask if I wanted to be seated. I tell him, \"I'm here to pick up an order I placed online\", and he goes, \"oh go over to Lindsey she's in charge of to-go\"... Doesn't even point this woman out or anything, so I guess I was just supposed to automatically know who Lindsey was. I go up to a woman behind the cash register, hoping this is the woman I need to speak to. She hands me my food and she was the only pleasant person I encountered there. So I go to meet up with my friend and we sit down to eat the food. I ordered the spinach and cheese quesadilla, which I've had before. I take a few bites and it's decent. I go to take another bite and bite down on something extremely hard. The pain I felt was excruciating, so I had to spit out the bite to see what was so hard. I look to see what it was and find a small, metallic pebble type thing. I made sure it wasn't maybe a piece of a pit or anything, but this object shined like metal. I went to feel my tooth to make sure what exactly happened, only to find that my filling had been completely destroyed. Unfortunately I didn't keep the metallic pebble because I just wanted to get rid of the food as soon as possible, so I threw it away, which I now regret because I wish I would've kept it so I could've brought it back and shown them what I found in my food. Will never be returning to this location, and am still debating whether I'll be eating at Pita Jungle again, simply because of the experiences I've had. My family owns a restaurant and I even went to culinary school, so I know the proper etiquette and health standards, and I believe this location isn't passing either of them.",

I came here with a friend around 2pm, looking to split their chicken and hummus plate. Although the pita bread is to die for, I opted for extra veggies. No up-charge, and I was even given extra veggies to go with my left over hummus. Great good, great customer service, and gluten-free friendly is my kind of place.",

    "text": "A crunchy vegans dream restaurant!  When I became a vegetarian Pita Jungle shot up high onto my list of go-to restaurants due to their focus on freshness and health, and their plentiful amounts of vegetarian centered menu.  Don't get me wrong, they have a variety of meat and fish dishes, and of course feta cheese!  But so much of their menu can easily be turned veggie or vegan in just a snap of the fingers.    It irked me when I would visit a restaurant and have to order the same, vaguely vegetarian menu item, usually smothered with cheese.  A few months back I took the leap from vegetarian to vegan and therefore that narrowed my menu selections even further, and eliminating nearly every chain restaurant.  In replace for those restaurants I welcomed Pita Jungle with open arms and it is my new favorite ever since!    Talk about delicious fresh food, hearty portions, and wonderful customer service!  Everything my family and I have ever ordered has been completely satisfying, it is apparent each dish is made with attention to detail and is typically brought to the table by someone with a beaming smile.  Wonderful place filled with wonderful food & people!",

When he went to pick it up, she asked for ID to make sure she was giving basically all of my life's information to the right person. This type of thing hasn't happened to me in years, so I'm extremely thankful not only for the great healthy food, but also the great people that work there and take care of their customers in every sense of the word.

I thought about what I was craving, you read that right, I choose my food off of cravings, and all I wanted in my life was the Mahi Mahi served over hummus from Pita Jungle. It comes with these pita chips that are to die for and makes for a fun twist on nachos, if you eat it like I do.  I ordered my meal using yelp, I think it's officially grub hub, and it said it'd be ready in 20-30 minutes. I didn't have that kind of time so I headed over the moment I ordered to be there when it was ready. I had never been to this particular Pita Jungle location and didn't expect it to be any different than the others in Tempe and Scottsdale that I had been. It took me just under 10 minutes to get there.  When I arrived I was pleasantly surprised with how quaint and welcoming the environment and space felt.. there was no room for me to show my hanger once I got inside. The gentleman at the bar was quick to help me and low and behold my food was ready!!   This may seem like a simple experience, and that's because it was! There is beauty in simplicity - I was so hungry I would've been deeply upset at any upset in my expectations, and they met my expectations perfectly.   Thank you! Also, I LOVE the art on the walls in the restaurant right now, I've been seriously considering going back just to shop the paintings haha!",

    "text": "The Pita Jungle is a locally based chain featuring a Mediterranean inspired menu. I was introduced to their cuisine by a friend, shortly after I moved to the valley back in 2009. And I've been enjoying their offerings ever since.  I was happy to see them expand into both Tucson and Flagstaff. Meanwhile, I've eaten at several of their locations in and around Phoenix. Consequently, I can say without hesitation, that the consistency of the food, from one Pita Jungle to the next, is remarkable! And recently, I had the pleasure of introducing another good friend of mine, and my oldest son, to the Pita Jungle near Mesa Community College.  The weather lately has been gorgeous, so we all agreed to eat on the patio. The service was both hospitable and relaxed. That's the general vibe you can expect at a Pita Jungle. And per usual, the service was excellent!  I've enjoyed nearly everything on the menu. So I suggested the hummus sampler which featured three kinds of hummus (regular, cilantro-jalapeno and roasted bell pepper), cucumbers, olives, and Pita bread. Needless to say, it's probably the best vegan appetizer you're likely to try. And I love meat!  I selected a gyro, which is typical, however, I tried the Roasted Chicken Shawarma for a change. It was just as excellent as any other gyro I've enjoyed here. My company also enjoyed their choices and their first visit.  The most remarkable thing about Pita Jungle, besides the incredible flavors offered across the menu, is that it's all fresh, very healthy, and heavy on vegan offerings. Who knew that was possible?",

Also when I asked her for her name not only did she tell me, but she reached out shook my hand and asked me what my name was and said nice meeting you. That made me feel like an appreciated customer.   The hostess was also very nice and said hello and greeted me when I walked in. I was able to see the peeps in the kitchen and they were moving and looked very determined to get all orders out on time.   They were so busy and I managed to get my walk in order in 10 minutes which is HUGE! The food was packed perfectly and it tasted amazing.

Per his request, I emailed Kevin my phone number and he quickly called me. The conversation wasn't exactly satisfying. I was told that the on site manager didn't realize how unhappy I was because \"I seemed fine\" - I explained that I wasn't going to lose my cool in front of my wife, my aunt, and my six month old. I was told I should have given the on site manager the chance to fully make things right - I explained that I didn't trust him at all once he acknowledged he saw us being neglected but didn't intervene until we complained. We discussed the expired coupons. I pointed out that it's cool they'd be willing to honor them, but it's halfway through 2018 (they've had time to print new ones) AND he missed multiple times that there was no reason for me to go back to that Pita Jungle because it's halfway across town. He told me multiple times that the on site manager was a good manager - glad he defends his employees, but that wasn't my experience, unfortunately. He then explained the corporate structure, and why I wasn't going to be getting anything other than I'd already gotten - which made me question why we got onto the phone together to begin with. He ended the call by saying he would see what else he could do.  He emailed me shortly later asking for my address, and saying he'd have non-location-specific gift cards mailed to me. It's been two weeks, and I haven't seen them. How long do I have to wait?",

Since I work in Mesa, where the to-go lunch options are VERY slim, I know I can rely on this place if I'm starving and in a rush. One of the nice things is that I can either call in my order or place my order online, and then pick it up in a flash.  Some of my menu favorites are the: pesto pizza, grilled veggie salad and cilantro jalapeno hummus. One of the nice things about pita jungle's menu is that the food isn't greasy and I don't feel like an oinker after scarfing down my lunch.  The atmosphere at this particular location is much more casual than the PJ in Arcadia, and the service is A-OK. I guess this place just doesn't get me really excited, but the food is good, healthy and somewhat close to my office in downtown Mesa.",

I always liked the food and casual friendly atmosphere.   My last visit there left me feeling decidedly \"meh\". The service was so casual that we barely saw our waitress once after ordering: to bring the bill. There were 3 of us - we ordered 3 apps and 3 dinners.  Dinner was \"fine\", though I remember it tasting \"fresher\" but what'ev. I wasn't expecting 5-star anything. It was a casual dinner with friends.   Also, you should know that if you want extra pitas with your apps, you can expect them to arrive with the bill.   So, if you go: be patient and order extra pitas when you order your iced tea.",

I could not even finish the gyro which I will split with someone next time I go. The lemonade was fresh too, but very tart. I think I will go with tea next time the acid in the lemonade did not agree with me. The service was fast and friendly. Overall if you are looking for healthy alternatives this is the place.",

    "text": "This is honestly the only Pita Jungle I've been impressed with. I enjoyed sitting outside with my family. The waitress was nice and even let my uncle sample some wine before bringing it out. She was tolerant of my uncle even though he kept calling her \"pita lady.\"   I had the black bean burger once, which was good. Not great, good. It came out on two toasted pieces of whole wheat toast. I really wanted a bun for the full ~burger-effect! Aside from that, my family ordered an appetizer the pita lady suggested; half cilantro-jalapeno hummus, half red bellpepper. We all got pretty full from that, and an order of tahini cauliflower we shared amongst ourselves for an appetizer. The tahini cauliflower is ridiculously delicious, in my opinion but my mother and a friend of mine weren't a fan, claiming it was too heavy. It may have been, since we all had lots of leftovers.  Another time I went, I sat inside near the exhibition kitchen where I could see my food being prepared. My aunt said she wasn't into seeing the cooks make her food, but I think it's all about preference as I think I may actually prefer it, now. I was relieved to see everyone was wearing gloves and not fiddling with their piercings or picking wedgies. You never know! I enjoy knowing my food is fresh, plus it's entertaining to watch hipsters crumble feta over salads. Am I right or am I right?  That same day I ordered the Mediterranean platter. It came with fresh hot falafels, tzatziki, hummus, baba ghanoosh, a block of feta cheese, dolmades, pita, taboule, and greenbean salad for only $10! I was happy with my food and the experience. The lemonade is good but has some kind of mango-ish syrup in it. Not what I expected, but whatever. I can't complain too much about this place because the service has been great. At the Pita Jungles I'd been to in the past, the service was kinda bad (inattentive, unfriendly, etc.)",

    "text": "Let me just start by saying the food at Pita Jungle is consistently very good.  However, my experience at Pita Jungle today ended with me being able to eat very little of it, so I couldn't really give it too much weight in my rating - hence the two stars.  4 of my coworkers and I headed up to Pita Jungle in Mesa today for lunch and it was my first visit to this location.  We weren't in a particularly big hurry since our boss was on vacation so we figured it would be a great day for Pita Jungle which is usually crowded for lunch.  However when we arrived there was no wait at all and we were seated immediately on the patio.  Great start.  The waitress came around after about 5 minutes and took our drink & appetizer order - we ordered the hummus trio.  We got our drinks in about 10 minutes and at that time she took our lunch order - couple salads, couple pitas & a falafel platter.  We then waited about another 15 minutes for our hummus to come out, which was kinda lengthy considering it was just hummus, but we weren't annoyed yet - just hungry!  After the hummus came out, we were left waiting another 35 or 40 minutes with nothing brought out from the kitchen.  The waitress had come around to fill our drinks a few times but had been MIA for a while.  When she finally came out to bring food to another table, we flagged her down and told her that we needed our food ASAP and we needed it TO GO.  We weren't rude or anything, but we let her know we'd been there for an hour and wouldn't be able to stay and eat.  She seemed really surprised which I found weird - um, is this the usual time frame for lunch around here??  After that, she brought out our checks (before the food was brought out!) and we were there for another 10 minutes before our food was ready and we could leave.  I strongly suspect the waitress forgot to put our lunch order in until we told her we needed it to go and that was why everything took so long.  But the most annoying thing was that she never even apologized or attempted to give an explanation, her attitude was just kind of \"oh well\".  We finally got back to our office (about 4 miles away) after a 1hr and 55min lunch of only hummus & pita bread.  In fact, my chicken shawarma pita is still wrapped up and waiting in the office fridge.",

I've had waitresses make a fuss when we wanted to change tables cause she seated us at a dirty table.  My potatoes arrived burnt and i got attitude when I asked for new ones (they were literally black).  On another occasion I was served a chicken wrap (I am vegan, and ordered veggie).  I didn't know it was a chicken wrap until I bit into the wrap.  Had a discussion with the manager about that.  On a separate occasion, I received a dirty cup, so I asked for a different glass.  The waitress was too busy or couldn't be bothered to help us so a \"runner\" brought out a new glass.  This glass was ALSO dirty (there were black marks on the glass)...the runner had an attitude and suggested he bring me a disposable cup, finally he brought me a clean glass.  The food is just as unreliable, but I'd say more often than not it is good, just not worth the service.  If it was not so hard to eat vegan in the valley I probably would never come here.  The hummus is ALWAYS yum yum yum.",

Their servings are generous, the prices are very decent for the quality of the food and the freshness of it, and if you have not been there for happy hour which is incredibly inexpensive, you really should try. Almost all the plates are between 1 and $3 and three or four will be very filling. I go there at least once a month, and I cannot recommend the chicken shawarma pita sandwich enough. Staff is friendly and very attentive, and while the location is not perfect because you look at a parking lot or Southern Avenue if you're sitting outside, at least they do have comfortable outside seating with sprinklers in the summer and heaters in the winter. Overall, if you go there and have a bad meal, I would be incredibly surprised. The Ray Road location has an outside seating area which looks at the lake, and the inside is very pleasant as are all the staff. The only thing I am not crazy about with the Southern Avenue location is that it is quite noisy in there and the acoustics are not good, although they have placed soundproof boards around the walls to dampen the noise.",

My only sadness is that I got a cup and not a bowl.  The hummus and gyros we had were amazing.  This place definitely earns it's 5 stars.  Keep it up!",

If so, then run to this Pita Jungle and prepare for your jaw to hit the floor as you witness their lack of customer service skills.  Took them 10 minutes to seat the two people in line ahead of me and for the next 5 minutes I was passed by at least 4 other servers before the lady behind the bar (who was swamped with phone orders) came up for air and said she would try to help me in a few.  I'm assuming that meant hours because I continued to wait (stubbornly at this point) and be ignored by the same servers still passing back and forth in front of me.  Don't waste your time here.",

Our time at the restaurant was pleasant and no issues and service was fine i even left a good tip. It started 8h later when my wife was throwing up all night long and the next day ended up in the emergency room being treated for food poisoning.  Make sure your chicken is thoroughly cooked at this location. She had the spicy bowl which she has had a couple times so it wasn't like we were trying new things. Just glad my daughters seem to be doing ok. Although my oldest did seem to have a loss of appetite the next day and did throw up later the following day. She only had 1 piece of chicken at dinner but can't say it's related. Just strange for her to turn down a cup cake the next day at a bday party being a 3 yr old.",

I got the Mediterranean chicken roasted shawarma (mainly cause the name was funny) and it was the perfect portion. There was an equal amount of everything so no flavor of one ingredient like the onion, tomato, or chicken overpowered the other. It was tasty meal overall. Cant exactly pinpoint why but there wasnt nothing to complain about it. The type of full I got from is was a very healthy one in that I didnt feel regretful of my decisions like I would with fries or ramen. My friend got the baba ganoosh (another funny sounding name) and the eggplant sauce that it came complemented my shawarma well so if you ever go to pita jungle, get a friend to order the baba ganoosh and swipe their sauce! (theres a lot so dont feel guilty)",

The few things I ordered on the side, actually came in the side (most places usually ignore that request) My husband got the salmon salad, very good as well. Carrie even told us the salmon would take a little longer. Of course we had to get the hummus, while we waited. The best original hummus I've had in a long time. The staff was friendly and Carrie our server was amazing. The manager was very kind and was working side by side with his staff.  Oh yeah! The carrot cake is a must get.  Definitely going back for more.",

    "text": "I love Pita Jungle. As a vegan, it has a plethora of delicious options that are light, healthy, hugely flavorful, and reasonably priced. The single reason I'm docking a star is because of the awful service I received this previous trip (Friday, Aug 21).   To preface this review, I've been going to Pita J's across the Valley for YEARS. I remember shoving my face with their hummus while studying for college finals, taking first dates there, and so it was a pretty cool milestone to be able to take my newborn and husband there as well. As a fellow restaurant patron, I always try to be hyper-conscientious about ensuring my kid doesn't disturb anyone's meal. The moment my baby's fussing becomes louder than speaking voice and makes noise lasting longer than a sentence, I'm picking her up and heading towards the door. Incidentally, she becomes silent the second I pick her up, but I subsequently walked across the restaurant a few times.   Anyway, our food arrives. I encourage my husband to eat his meal and not wait for me. When I sat back down after heading towards the door, our server comes... and drops off the bill. No asking if we needed anything else, if we wanted dessert, nothing. She then says, \"I'll bring you a to-go box for your food.\" I looked confused at my husband and asked, \"did you ask for the bill?\" He looked surprised and said, \"...no... did you?\" It was hard not to take offense at a server who clearly was trying to push us out the door. It wasn't even like we were holding up a large table during rush hour--the restaurant had few patrons and plenty of open tables. We actually asked her if she wanted us to leave, and she stammered some excuse. If she had been at all friendly to us during the meal, I might try to interpret her gesture as helpful and proactive, but instead it just seemed like a terribly rude gesture from a bad server. We walked out of the restaurant feeling embarrassed, unwelcome, and, for me, still hungry.   I'm hoping this to be a one-off event. I have positive memories of great Pita J service, such as getting 10% off as a \"biker's discount\" when I rode in on my Harley. Normally the staff is wonderful... but this was one bad apple.",

The food was amazing, and the service was wonderful. Our server Liz suggested I try the jerk chicken wrap and it was delicious. We had the hummus trio as an appetizer - sooooo gooood! My mom had the Mediterranean chicken salad which she loved. Also being on a special diet, my dad has many food restrictions, but Liz was extremely patient and got him a dish he really enjoyed. All in all, our experience at pita jungle was awesome. Everyone was so friendly, and we look forward to eating there again soon!",

And also with the order of hummus you should be able to choose if you would like pita bread or veggies to dip it with for those who do not tolerate grains. The one time I asked for veggies in place of pita I was brought a small plate of about 6 cucumbers that left me with lots of hummus and nothing to dip with and I was charged for them.",

So irritating! The manager said that because we were told we could have the dog we could do it. This was so embarrassing...everyone was staring. So we sit outside and no one comes over...for 15 minutes...so we left and went to Taco Bell (lol). The last time we were there they were super slow too. Ugh, that place is so below standard.

    "text": "Pita Jungle is my gold standard for Mediterranean food. Sure, it's more fusion than authentic, but the food is amazing, the portions are huge, and the prices are fantastic.   Every single time I come here, I get the Hummus with Chicken. They make hands down the best hummus I've ever had. It's smooth, creamy, with just the right balance of tahini, garlic, and garbanzo beans. They serve it with delicious hot, chewy pitas, and top it with a whole lot of roasted, spiced chicken and pine nuts. Outstanding.   Their other obvious Greek choices are damn good as well. The baba ganoosh is beautifully roasted and mashed, with just a bit of spiciness to it. The falafel is perfectly fried, without being burned or soggy, and richly flavored with cumin and chickpeas. The taboule is absolutely stellar and brightly flavored with parsley and lemon.   The pizzas and pita wraps are all pretty large, especially for the price. They offer a fair diversity of pre-arranged combos: everything from a philly cheesesteak pita (for the less adventurous) to a chipotle chicken lavosh pizza. There are salads and pastas as well, also presenting a mix of Mediterranean cuisine with more familiar flavors. Personally, I love the pizzas and end up ordering one about every time I go, my favorite being the lavosh pizza.  Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything here. Everything is fresh, healthy, delicious, and enormous. Even the daily specials have nearly always been wonderful (barring a poorly executed attempt at Tikka Masala). The wide diversity of the menu means that even people who don't care for Greek food will be able to find something enjoyable. But, the high quality of food also means those people may end up changing their minds.",

    "text": "I've written reviews for various other Pita Jungle locations and my opinion of this one mostly echoes those that came before it. Good food, big portions, good prices. I finally got around to checking out this location and it has now replaced the Apache location as my PJ of choice. I like the setup here, and the staff is a bit more friendly and laid back. One thing that people don't talk about much is PJ's happy hour, which has awful hours, but is a total STEAL. Check out my pics for some examples from the small plates / tapas menu.  Happy Hour goes from 3pm-5:30pm during the week (perfect excuse to ditch work early!) and then Reverse Happy Hour is every night from 9-10pm. Everything is $3 and under. The hummus trio for only a buck is a sure bet. It's a good amount for the price. All the other dips are $1 too, including baba ganoosh, tzatziki, and garlic dip. You get a half a pita bread with each. It's not really enough pita for the amount of dip, but I never miss it since I am busy devouring the other items like the falafel. For $2 you get 2 good sized falafel and if you are like me you can scoop up the rest of your hummus with the falafel pieces for some hardcore chickpea on chickpea action.  The scallops ($3 for 2) are another winner for me. Served in a creamy  curry sauce, I could easily down 2 or 3 orders of them alone. Other seafood selections include shrimp and mussels. The sole meat choice on the menu is the Garlic Lemon Chicken with pine nuts. It's not my favorite. The portion is small and I find it overseasoned, though they are generous with the pine nuts.  One minor disappointment for me is the lack of vegetable dishes on the tapas menu. There is the mozzarella with tomato, but it's only one slice of each. Then the mushrooms which of course are not really a veggie. I'd like to see maybe a roasted peppers & eggplant dish, or something along those lines.  Beers are $2-$3 a bottle during happy hour, and house cabernet or chardonnay will run you $3 a glass. So bring a group and get one of everything on the tapas menu, it will only run you $25! Then drink, and be merry :)",

My sister whp is picky as hell ordered a salad that did ended up not being what she thought it was and they exchanged it for something else she wanted without any problems. I was willing to pay for both, but they were awesome about it and exchanged it with no charge! Sometimes you might get a waiter/waitress who would act bitchy about this and given the fact they were so cool about it, def earned them extra brownie points.

    "text": "One of my favorite restaurants in the valley, ever.  This location in particular is my fave.  Years ago I'd go there when I was taking classes at MCC.. I came so often that a waitress remembered my order when I went back recently.  It's very laid back, but I think one thing that separates this location from the others is that the servers are super nice and chill, not hipster and weird.  Sorry.. I just felt so judged when I went to other places haha.  :)    Food-wise.. the hummus is a MUST.  I can't decide if I like the cilantro/jalapeno or the roasted bell pepper better.  When in doubt, they will give you both.  I always order the chicken pasta salad for my meal, which is huge and can be split into two meals.  It's pretty basic, pasta with grilled chicken and a super delish lemon vinaigrette.  They have great green tea too!  Definitely a great place to visit.. especially if you're looking to avoid a super heavy, fattening meal.  It's hard to leave this place and feel guilty.",

    "text": "We discovered Pita Jungle when our daughter gave us a newspaper article that discussed the best places for vegan/vegetarian dining in the Phoenix area.  Pita Jungle was on the list and since it was near our hotel, we decided to give it a try.  It's not strictly a vegan/vegetarian restaurant---it does serve entrees with meat, chicken and fish.  Upon first entering, we noticed that the decor was nothing to write home about.  However, we feel that doesn't matter if the food is good.  We were greeted by our server who told us to pick a table and she would bring us some menus.  She was very friendly and helpful.  In fact, she talked us through the menu---even making some suggestions.  Surprisingly, despite the restaurant's name, she suggested not ordering a pita sandwich because---as she put it---you can get pita sandwiches in many other places.  She also warned us that their entree portions were huge.  We decided to go with two of her recommendations.  I ordered the Lavosh Sharwarma Wrap and my husband ordered the Lentil Fatoosh Salad.  About the Lavosh Sharwarma Wrap---Lavosh is sometimes called Armenian cracker bread and comes in a crisp or soft version.  This wrap had the soft version which still had a cracker like consistency.  It was very tasty---the chicken was moist and flavorful, the grilled vegetables (tomatoes and onions) were well prepared and complimented the chicken quite well.  However, the garlic sauce which had a mayonnaise look and consistency was on the bland side.   This sandwich comes with a Greek salad.  I asked the waitress if I could get the salad without Feta Cheese since I'm not a fan.  She said that was OK.  The salad had lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers and Kalamata olives that had pits in them.  The dressing was a lemon vinaigrette.  All in all a great meal.  And, yes, it was quite filling.  I ended up bringing half the sandwich to our daughter!  About the Lentil Fatoosh Salad.  This consists of lentils and rice with carmelized onions over mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, pita chips and lemon vinaigrette.  My husband---much to his suprise---really enjoyed it.  I tasted it and agreed with him.   The flavors melded very well together.  Again, he also couldn't eat it all and our daughter got some of that!  When we asked our waitress for boxes, she said, basically, \"See?  I told you it was a lot of food!\"  To drink, I had their freshly made lemonade and it was very refreshing---not too tart yet not too sweet---and refills were free!  My husband had an orange flavored Pellegrino water.  He was quite surprised to see that on the beverage menu!  It's too bad we're not planning any more Arizona trips as our daughter is moving or we certainly would return to this Pita Jungle!",

Although I didn't really eat, I tried some type of cilantro dip with pita bread, which is already an awesome combo. I ordered an alcoholic drink, and it was really good, I could tell they didn't dilute the alcohol at all either. My dates grub (chicken pita) looked soooo good as well, has sauteed mushrooms. BIG WIN all around from me. The only reason why I didn't put 5 stars was because the waitress was not very friendly with me at all. At first I thought it was just me being too sensitive, but my date quickly noticed her behavior towards me as well. We even joked that she might have a crush on him and doesn't like me, or maybe she's seen him there before with family and thought he had another girlfriend and that I was the side chick.. XD either way, it was still a nice place. Pretty fancy compared to what I originally thought it was. Probably don't want to take your kids here if they are kind of rowdy. I know I won't be taking my son here til he's older.",

The pita wrap had brown lettuce also 30%.  I threw it away and called today for a refund.  It was so bad I didn't want to return.  In the past I have frequent tempe location and it has always been really fresh.  Such a shame that organic places can keep up appearances.",

I had about a billion glasses of iced tea (our server kept swooping into refill my glass) and a delicious pesto pizza that I'd happily order again.

It was this month's special I think...Anyhow, it was TASTY...and I was smothering it with more hummus and siracha...mmmm.....(cleaning up drool). So Rachel is the best server and this is mainly to give a shout out to her. She always remembers what we like to drink, that we get veggies with the hummus and not the pita, and the other sinful indulgences that we love to eat.  A good server knows their customer, is prompt with service, and has a smile on their face. She really does enjoy her job and that makes a huge difference.  I think this PJ has the best food and service out of the ones that I have eaten at. Rachel is a big reason that we keep coming back.  If you go, hopefully you get her :) and you should have a great experience. Just don't be a bitchy land-hag or douchebag because nobody likes those customers anyhow!!",

Let's just say West Mesa is a cozy, gun ridden, overhead copter flyin-spotlight shinin', dilapidated, killer cop area.  Hell- even TGI Friday's went out of buiness here.   I have not experienced the other locations, but I love the food.  The staff has always been very friendly and quick.  I have mostly done take out.  My favorites are the Chicken Shawarma, the  jalapeno and cilantro hummus and the lentil soup.  There are many other things I am interested in trying.  The decor is desperate if I have to say anything negative, which I don't, but it is alarmingly sparse, all neutral colors, crooked hanging paintings, poor lighting and bargain sale furniture.  It is surprising because the staff is obviously artistic, as they are quite decorated themselves.",

They are careful to cultivate \"we're a healthy place for uppity people\" and the service reflected that - dinner was hardly packed but everybody was waiting long periods for their waiter, we even talked with other tables who complained about the same thing. Our waiter spilled water on a party member and instead of apologizing and offering a free appetizer or something just disappeared.  The food taste was okay, and it was more fresh than fast food joints but nothing particularly special for people who regularly eat healthy or fresh. I think they relied more on their reputation than continuing hard work. Portions were large, but the price was also higher than I thought fitting for the bad service and often dry breads - most of the meals were good but there was always something that seemed dry or bland, for me it was the pita bread. Joe's Farm Grill had astoundingly tasty, fresh food and Pita Jungle was just a decent downtown place. Probably great for time-pressed college kids, but too reliant on a reputation.",

    "text": "Since Pita Jungle is right across the street from Mesa Community College on Southern and Dobson, I've heard a lot about it after I started attending MCC in September. Many kids in my classes have mentioned Pita Jungle and how tasty it is, so I had to see what all the hype was about. Since a few of my friends told me that the quesadilla there is better than any others around, I knew I had to give it a shot. When I sat down in the restaurant I asked my server about this, so called \"best quesadilla around,\" and he backed up what I've heard by telling me it's one of their most ordered meals. My usual quesadilla diet consists of simple, homemade versions with tortillas and shredded cheddar cheese, or Taco Bell's small, greasy version. So, I wasn't expecting to get much more than that. Maybe because I've never really seen anything different. But what I saw when my food arrived pretty much amazed me! I was staring down at a giant, crispy mass of melty cheese and perfectly grilled chicken. The first thing I noticed was the size. Taco Bell's version is a thin layer of cheese with a little shredded chicken folded in a greasy tortilla, in a small semi-circular shape. However, Pita Jungle's version was a large, crispy, rectangular shaped pita filled easily half an inch thick with multiple cheeses, chicken, and spinach. After staring for a few minutes, I couldn't just examine it anymore, I had to take a huge bite to see if it was as wonderful as it looked; and it most surely was! The melted blend of cheddar, mozzarella, and feta cheeses was what I imagine cheese heaven to be like. The chicken was grilled to perfection with just the right ammount of crispiness, and the pieces in each bite were huge. Finally, the spinach leaves were a nice little touch that tasted great thrown in the middle of the warm, thick cheese. I ate slowly to enjoy every bite and by the end of my night, I had to cram because I was so full. Once every scrap was gone, I came to my conclusion. Pita Jungle definitely has the best chicken quesadilla I've ever eaten, by a landslide! It has the tastiest ingredients, best portion size, and is down right the most beautiful meal I've layed eyes upon. Let me also point out that the service was super speedy for such a huge and delicious meal. I went on a Friday night, and even thought the restaurant was packed, it only took minutes for my meal to arrive. To make a long story short, I would highly recommend Pita Jungle's chicken quesadilla to anyone!",

Our food order took almost an hour and a half.  We had a pita burrito, a chicken wrap (also overcooked), and a gyro (still rubber).  I would not recommend this place to anyone, even my worst enemy.

Only minor drawback was my original email ended up in their spam folder. I would recommend calling in to verify the order was received to anyone doing orders via email.   I will definitely order here again!",

It comes with amazing deep fried pita strips, just enough to keep it healthy and also add fabulous flavor and texture. The crispy caramelized onions, grapes, raisins, and walnuts are all perfectly seasoned with curry powder. Anyone who has not tried this dish needs to!!!",

They have good margaritas $2 & you can try just about all the starters between $2-$3.   The food was good but my drink...I didn't like the fact that I ordered a pitamosa & my waitress brought it to me w. a bug in it. & I didn't like I had to sit there for like 10 mins for her to come back & me have to tell her to take it back.   Also, I noticed the bartender sitting there just talking before bringing \"my\" drink to another table & walking to the kitchen to sit it down & wait for my waitress to bring it to me.?. They were like confused in there & need to step their game up becos other Pita's I have been to have been a lil' bit better in experience.   But, the chefs, I love! They have flavor! Bomb spot for Vegan & Mediterranean lovers. Would love some WIFI, would be nice to add there.",

She finally blesses us with her presence but after we interrupted her from joking with her staff- Twice I have come to this place and had issues both times it's the same tall waiter with a beard.

We started off with a mix plate of roasted bell pepper hummus, jalapeno/cilantro hummus and baba ganoosh.  It came with two pitas and all three were very tasty!  Next up was the broiled chicken salad. Very tasty and the lemon vinaigrette dressing was delicious!  My friend tried the lavosh shawarma warp and enjoyed it very much.  The garlic sauce makes that wrap!  Our server, Skyler was excellent as well.  Everything just when you expected it.  Made many suggestions that applied to what we were ordering.  Genuinely gave a damn about what he was doing. Last but not least, offered up \"to-go\" drinks at the end of our meal.  Not in any way trying to get us to leave, just a nice touch before leaving.  Other things that may or may not matter to anyone reading this: It has a nice patio and open floor plan inside. Keep in mind it's directly across the street from Mesa Community College.  I notice all different kinds of people when dining here.  It adds to the whole experience for me.  I'm not hung up on clothing choices or body art my server(s) wear, as long as they are doing a great job.  Will I continue to go here?  Absolutely!",

This last time I came in the service was painfully slow and the cooks in the back were having a gay ol time cracking jokes and laughing/ horse playing.

Our server was Michelle, and I'm not sure if it was her first day (which shouldnt mean anything, everyone has a first day but you can tell they always bust their a** making sure they do what they can) but she was incoherent to what was going on.. She placed our order and then went and sat at a table where we could clearly see her and started eating! We had several different servers bring us our food, which they brought incorrectly bringing us the wrong appetizer. The whole time we could just see our server sitting down eating while we were still waiting on my order to come. My sisters had finished eating by the time she decided to do her job and come inform me that my pesto pizza had been given to someone else by \"mistake\".

Not only did she not bring the kids food out first but waiting to bring everything including the appetizer together. We asked for different pita chips since they were now cold and we saw them sitting there forever to which another waitress just wanted to argue about how pita chips are always cold, multiple times. I do not care that your location serves them cold, just bring out warm ones. Will not be visiting this location again.",

When I got there to pick up my order, someone came out of the kitchen and said they forgot to put salt in my hummus..I couldn't wait so I told them I would add salt to it. Next, the chicken was extremely dry, meh! The pitas were cold and not soft at all. Very disappointing lunch for $12. Can you put utensils in the to go bags, please? I may try it again, but not sure",

We had nice patio seating, around 7pm, three of us girlfriends.  Our server took forever to get us our drinks to the point we had to go up to the bar after a while to get them ourselves.  Then before our food came out, we were told one of the things I ordered was out: (Kafta Burger was out prior to me ordering it) cauliflower, so now I had to get something I'd never had before: Spinach Lavosh Quesadilla.  OK, fine.  My spinach lavosh thing was a gross combo but I was hungry, so I ate it.  The spinach was a terrible ingredient in this combo, I think Arugula would've tasted better or even basil.  My friends Gambas were tiny and the sauce was below-par (she also usually orders this at the Ray/Dobson location... flop.  Our drinks were correct but the table next to us (who were there for a birthday) got their drinks and their food all screwed up, plus really late.  They complained and got helped by a guy... we didn't complain as we figured they'd covered our concerns already.  It is terrible planning when a restaurant like this doesn't have things off the menu.. it's frustrating to keep ordering and keep being told they're out.  Get your stuff together, folks!",

It's even better if you're vegetarian as they have so many vegetarian options.  They literally have everything and everything is always fresh, tasty and presented very well.  They have lots of hummus and other dips, soups, sandwiches, wraps, burgers, salads both cold and grilled options, main plated dishes...literally everything!   They also have a full bar with a great HH starting at 3pm with drink specials and lots of small tapas ranging $1-$3.   In the past I've had several salads, hummus and soups.  This week I landed in PHX at 6pm, worked the next day til 2 and of course I made a stop on my way to the airport.  Yesterday I had the seared ahi tuna and hummus starter.  I wasn't expected the tuna to be merged into the hummus but it tasted great!  I also had the caramelized cauliflower with tahini, I only had a few bites of this as I didn't realize it was fried.  I enjoyed a nice cold Diet Pepsi and my server Dargen was nice enough to give me one for the road as well!  I'll be back in AZ in a few months and will definitely be back here or to one of the other locations they have throughout the city!",

We went to the bar to place a to-go order with maybe 3 other people at the bar from the time we walked in to the time we left with one entree and a smoothie (easily 30 min wait). The seat I decided to sit in had the check, empty beer pint and dirty plate from the last patron, I pushed all forward closer to the bartender yet neither were cleared the entire time we were there, gross.   My girlfriend was interested in their Guava Lemonade and asked the bartender if it was good only to feel like a complete fool for asking with his response, \"uhm it's guava and lemonade.\"; Thanks buddy, we can read. The entree we ordered was the Chicken Del Sol, expecting marinated grilled chicken unfortunately it was diced, Super Dry chicken in a bath of tomato based sauce. More of a soup than an entree.   The only thing that was somewhat alright was their strawberry banana smoothie (or milkshake), which came out 10 minutes after the entree came bagged out ready to go. I don't say all of this arrogantly, we both work in the restaurant/hospitality industry and were disappointed, let alone it bring our first time there.",

The pita was delicious - great flavor in the falafel on chewy soft pita bread.   The thing that made Pita Jungle lose a star was their bathroom - the water in the sink doesn't stay on unless you're holding it down and the soap came out of the dispenser so forcefully it spattered on my shirt - neither are deal-breakers, but things I noted.",

So I just remembered they had a black bean burger and ordered that without looking at or even touching the menu. The place was dirty, I sat by the window and the window seal was covered with dust and etc.. The booth table leaned down towards the window and the seat was sunk down in the middle, it was worn out. The black bean burger completely fell apart. You couldn't take a bite without parts dropping off the burger on to the plate. It was a mess.  I asked the waiter, Chris, for some ketchup, he delivered me an empty bottle and walked away. I had to wait and call him over again and ask for another ketchup bottle.   Chris asked me if I want a doggie bag for the fallen apart pieces. I said no thanks, it didn't even taste good. I only has a couple of bites.  He did not offer me anything after I advised him it all sucked. I paid full price and left..  I will not be coming back.",

Maybe I just don't like the artwork-but this is not a place I enjoy sitting down to a meal.  The service is very hit-or-miss (they either wanna sit down and eat with you or you have to hunt them down just to pay and get out) and like I said, the ambiance is...weird, for lack of a better term.   I perfer the one in Tempe much better for atmosphere, even the one in Chandler. This location is perfectly adequate for picking up dinner on the way home from work.",

It's not as noisy as the other locations and not usually as crowded.  The food is great - as always.  Sometimes service is slow at this location and several times we've seen our food sitting on the counter ready for service, only to wait 5-10 minutes before it gets scooped up and delivered by the server.

The grape leaves, the lentil soup, the unchanging specials... it's the perfect escape from organic chemistry at MCC across the street.

We used to live in AZ and on special occasions like birthdays, valentines day etc we used to go to dinner at Pita Jungle. Their food is fantastic, fresh and amazing!! When we decided to have them cater the event the staff and contact for the services was so incredibly nice, friendly, thorough and made the entire experience so amazing!!

The portion sizes are HUGE and I can make 3 meals out of 1 from there, an the pricing for it is so reasonable! I highly recommend this place!  I've seen reviews from other people of this place, and maybe they didn't have the best service, but the other 2 locations I have been to, the one in Tempe and the one in Phoenix, have all been positive.  From what I was told, this place is all about the simplicity of food and the less done to it the better, as well as maintaining a casual atmosphere.  I appreciate this approach as the more you add to food, the less healthy it can become.  It is a very casual atmosphere, and since it is not a corporate establishment, you should not expect the wait staff to act like they come from a corporate owned restaurant unless they did, like our server was.  There are some non-vegetarian options as well as mostly vegetarian, and so far I have not had 1 disappointing meal.  My fiance, who's first Pita Jungle experience this was and is an avid eater, was extremely impressed with this place.  It's definitely worth the money and the food is very, very good!",

We arrived about 5:30pm, placed our order and everything seemed fine until we realize it was quarter after 6.  Husband went to find the manager to see what took so long, because we noticed a nearby table got their food when they arrived 10 minutes or so after us.  Manager said he will check on the order and come talk to us.  We waited, but he didn't come out.  When we left we went thru the main dining area (we were on the patio) to see if he was on his way to talk to us.  We left because they had a seminar to go to that night and couldn't wait any longer.  The entire evening was horrible because we went to Jack in The Box next to Pita Jungle and inhaled the food, which gave some of us a heartburn.",

    "text": "I went to this location the other day for a quick (and cheap) late ish night dinner. The food was delicious.... the service was terrible! I ordered the grilled chicken with hummus appetizer and got it was the garlic dip and the cilantro and jalapeno hummus. This is so wonderful... I love the different kinds of dip and the chicken is really flavorful, plus they give you a ton of food, so I took half home for another day. The BF got the beef gyro.... it was a little weird. The beef is all thin sliced and kind of looks like Steakums or something. The flavor wasn't great.... they really should use chunks of beef or something. Anyway, the flavor was ok, not great but not bad. The real problem was the service. We were seated and then sat there with no service for about 10 minutes. Finally, someone came around to take our drink and food order. He was friendly enough, but he didn't give us any silverware or napkins and he didn't come around and fill our waters at all. I thought this really put a damper on the experience. Of course, I will come back because this place is close, cheap, and tasty... but next time I will get it to go.",

We waited more for someone--anyone to show up at our table to serve us.  We thought of food.  We thought of drink.  We thought of other places to eat.  So after further waiting, we got up and left.  The hostess said \"have a good night!\"  Sure, we will, somewhere else!",

Love the vegan info on the website, and I love that the staff will help you figure out awesome substitutions.   Definitely hipster but the food is excellent and the people are fun!",

    "text": "I had the third best falafel of my life here... and that's saying a lot. Falafel is one of the staples of my diet when traveling on the road, and I've had so much variety that I've become quite picky about what I like. My buddy Shane from Mastodon Body Piercing brought me here when I was in town, and I was thoroughly impressed. The waiter was attentive despite the restaurant being packed, the food was scrumptious, and it wasn't outrageously priced. The decor was inviting. I look forward to eating here again in the future.",
