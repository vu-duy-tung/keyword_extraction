    "text": "5 stars for customer service. This is our go-to place for Chinese take-out after having tried a bunch of places in our area. The food is consistent, standard Chinese-American, always hot, with fresh veggies.   Tonight, though, I was prompted to write a review. I am vegetarian and my husband is a little picky, and as such I made asked for some substitutions to our order. I ordered Mooshoo vegetable with no egg (my preferece) and veggie fried rice with added tofu and no mushrooms (hubbie's preference after finding a rogue mushroom last time). Also ordered a few other items.  5 minutes later, China Village called back to double-check that I also didn't want egg in the fried rice since I had asked for it in the mooshoo. I thanked him for asking, and no, we did not want any egg in the rice.   I went to pick up the order, and the sweet little lady at the counter told me that that also made sure to take the mushrooms out of our soup, since she was worried that we couldn't eat mushrooms and didn't want us to worry about finding them.   They did not have to pay such close attention to details, and I wouldn't have complained if none of these things had occurred. But because they went the extra mile, my appreciation was far greater than my dissatisfaction would have been.   Support this place and show them that customer service still means something!",

    "text": "China Village, I would like to award you 5 stars. My boyfriend and I are in love with you. Absolutely our go-to Chinese restaurant.   Why do I love it so much? Well...   The service is fantastic. Especially this one gentlemen that works there, that always seems to be wearing a bow-tie. He is friendly and funny, and I get excited whenever we are seated in his section. With that said, I don't want to take away from the other people that work there, because they are all awesome too. I am yet to have a sub-par experience with the staff.  They start you off with complimentary hot tea and water. It's good tea too. It's unsweetened, but if you are like my boyfriend and need it sweet, there is sugar available of course. However, I like it as is.  The food itself is wonderful. The first time I went, I had a spicy shrimp dish, served with steamed white rice. It had the perfect amount of kick, and there was just enough to fill me up and and then some to take home to enjoy later. My personal favorite dish though is the beef and broccoli. Definitely a classic, but the broccoli is always the perfect texture, and the sauce is so rich and the beef is always great  for this dish. Usually we get the dinner combination that comes with a bowl of soup (also good), a crab puff, a chicken wing, and an egg roll. I usually trade my boyfriend the eggroll for the chicken wing, because they are each of our favorites.   This place is great for a weeknight dinner out..... Well, really any dinner out, I'm gonna be honest. Or lunch for that matter. Actually, whenever you want to eat out, just go here :)",

I enjoy their hot tea, although if you are going to drink something else you have to let them now, because sometimes they only bring the hot tea and that is it.",

    "text": "Trust these good reviews, my fellow yelpers and yelpees.  China Village is an excellent restaurant.  I rarely give a restaurant 5 stars based on a single visit, but everything about my visit was fantabulous.  From the moment I walked in until the moment I walked out, they made me feel like a valued customer.  The service was PHENOMINAL.  The waiters and waitresses here CARE about you, and they are very social and entertaining as well.    On to the food!  My waiter gave me several samples throughout my meal.  The first one was the special of the day, which I did like but did not order.  It was mongolian lamb, and if I wasn't totally in the mood for something else, I definitely would have given it a shot.  The other sample he gave me later on was peking duck wrapped in a mooshoo pancake.  I'm not usually a big fan of duck and, honestly, I had no idea what it was until he told me.  But when I took a bite out of it, it was like biting into heaven!  I think I might have to start eating duck now!!  What I actually ordered was a bowl of the Wor Wonton soup, an egg roll and hunan chicken.  Let's start with the Wor Wonton soup.  When I saw the price on the menu I was a bit surprised.  It's over $5.00 for a small order of soup and $1.00 more for the large.  I wonder why they do this?  The soup is supposed to be an appetizer, not a MEAL... and that's essentially what it was.   The small soup was in a LARGE transparent bowl.  Transparent so that you could see all the good meat and vegetables they throw in there.  I'm glad it was, too, because I saw shrimp in there and I don't like shrimp.. he had no problem taking it back to remove the shrimp.  When he returned, and I tried this soup, I almost soupgasmed right there.  There's only one other place where I've ever had wonton soup this good.  The flavor of the broth was just absolutely AMAZING and the wontons were the perfect texture. On top of that there was plenty of cabbage and other roast pork floating around in there, carrots, scallions, the works.  I had to force myself to stop eating it so that I would have room for the rest of my meal.  The egg roll was average.  It was definitely nice and crispy, but it was thin and it almost like eating just fried batter.  I can't really reduce my review because of one egg roll though.  The hunan chicken was perfect.  The sauce was deliciously spicy and the whole dish was tasty.    The only thing I DIDNT like about it, was the amount of those bamboo shoots they put in it.  I would much rather have something crunchier like bok choy and/or water chestnuts but there were none in there.  I suppose I could have asked him to make it with them, but I'm not the type of person to ask for substitutes.  Overall my experience there was excellent.  I was totally happy and satisfied when I left.  The decor is not bad.  It's not the Taj Mahal.  It just a local Chinese restaurant.",

I hope they don't do any renovations anytime soon since the place has a lot of the same old school mid-century charm I remember from long ago.    I only take off one star because of the kung pao beef I ordered.  Over the years, It's been my favorite dish; plenty spicy, and the beef so tender it melted in your mouth.  Now, it's only half as spicy, and the beef is no longer tender, but breaded and fried.  That makes it no longer gluten-free, which limits menu choices for some.  I'll definitely be coming back though, to try some of the other dishes I see recommended here.",

    "text": "The Short: A downtown Chinese restaurant still holding onto archetypes linked to 'the good old days.'   The Pros: - Friendly and personable staff. - Food comes out fresh and hot. - Vintage decor.  The Cons: - One refill maximum on soda. - Staff members barely speak English. - A singular ingredient often overpowers flavor of food.  - Restaurant policies are designed for you to eat menu items the way they see fit or spend tons of $$$. ***EX: All items come only with white rice. You have to spend $1.50 for a small cup of friend rice. No substitutions.***  ______________________________________________________  The Story:  I haphazardly found China Village on my way to a concert at the Rhythm Room. I wanted something in my stomach before starting my night of music and debauchery. Before even checking my trusty Yelp app, the restaurant caught my attention with its folksy outside decor. Its exterior resemblance to Chicago's China district convinced me that it would, at the very least, have the basics of (American style) Chinese cuisine mastered. So, ignoring the old idiom, 'never judge a book by its cover,' I parked my car and walked into what ended up being an antiquated social environment.   First, I'd like detail the food. The menu is laid out in a similar manner to any local Chinese restaurant across America. I always wondered why these are so similar. Is there a database they buy them from? Does the Chinese government teach its citizens how to sell to Americans prior to getting their passports approved? Is it a subliminal demonstration of the Red Dragon's united might? More than likely, the answer is I just eat too much Chinese food.   China Village lost some points with me from the very start with their policies. First, sodas, which run $2 for a comically small cup, are limited to a single refill. This is often the highest profit item for restaurants and the owners plan to keep it that way with their authoritarian statute. Second, all items come with white rice. No substitutions. You can purchase a small cup of fried rice for $1.50, but you are still getting a large serving dish of white rice. God help you if you don't eat it all! The judgmental looks I got put me back in the mindset of a preschooler getting lectured about starving Ethiopians for not finishing dinner.   The dishes are presented in an alluring manner but lack any True substance. I ordered the house chicken, which on the menu boasted a plethora of ingredients. Expecting an orgasm, insert childish laughter here, of subtle and complex flavors; I was surprised when all I could taste was garlic. That's it. It didn't have a hint of poultry, nor a snifter of spice, or even a splash of citrus. Just garlic. On the bright side, I no longer stay awake at night in fear that the kid from Twilight will break through my bedroom window. Not because he played a vampire in a movie, but because all actors are soulless creatures that live off the blood of others and are repelled by garlic. It's just a scientific fact.   Lastly, I'd like to detail the atmosphere. The entire decor of the restaurant has been well taken care of but appears as if it hasn't been updated since the '80s. The staff, while genuinely courteous, followed too many stereotypes to not be deliberate. Every decision I made was met with a compliment pertaining to my ability or intelligence. No one spoke more than a few words of broken English and all the servers were women.   I'm just an old chunk of coal. I don't know how to tell authentic Chinese cuisine from that being altered for American tastes. I'm not privy of the social markers indicative to Chinese hospitality.   I do know when front is being put up. I'm understand that just because someone talks or acts a certain way doesn't mean they are creating traditional delicacy.   The reason for this front became alarmingly apparent while watching fellow patrons of China Village. The less English a hostess spoke the more they were tipped and the happier the customer appeared. It was an experience for them; especially those over 60.   The workers and owners of this establishment are merely responding to an economic incentive. People are awarding them for acting a certain way. Maybe this reminds them of 'the good old days' when an Asian American was only from China or Japan. There's a chance customers don't realize they are sending hegemonic messages. Overall, I don't think this is done with some malicious intent in mind, but it's not something I want to support.   The food here isn't really that tasty, and because I'm not into the pageantry being displayed, there is very little reason for me to come back.",

Here's the highlights... a ton of sauteed and soggy onions,  very soggy green onions and a very bland,  generic sauce.  The peanuts might have been pan fried,  there wasn't enough to tell.    The chicken was equally lacking.   I asked for extra spicy,  and received a couple of dried peppers,  which unless actually prepared with the dish,  doesn't impart any heat,  unless you try chewing on one of those insanely tough beasts.   The vegetable eggroll was the size of my thumb,  and the filling complete mush.  The wonton was way overcooked which made the filling into a small rock of indestructible material. Fail,  fail and fail.   The rice had the appropriate amount of stickiness... So there was one positive note.",

We are always greeted like old friends, even if we haven't been by in months. My only complaint? The staff seems to look younger than ever, while I get older and older. Oh well.   The food is wonderful. Our family favorite is the Bo Bo Platter, a delicious participatory collection of egg rolls, shrimp, honey chicken, fried won ton... and you get to play with fire. Upon completing the platter on our most recent visit, our six year old remarked, \"You mean there's more food coming?\" Yes there was and she managed to find plenty of room for the Moo Shu Chicken, or what she called her \"Chinese burrito\". The little ones also love the aquarium situated by the front door and their mom appreciates the clean rest rooms.   If you're looking for trendy, you might think that the China Village dining room could use a bit of an update. A fair observation, I suppose. It's comfy and familiar to us, however, so we hope they don't change a thing.",

They offer 'dinner specials' that run about 14$ and come with a decent amount of food (soup, eggroll, the dish, rice). The issue is, the meal is way too much for one person but not enough for two. The husband got their pineapple chicken.... very sweet as expected. I got potstickers...they were not amazing. So why 3 stars? I can see why this place would appeal to some people and the egg drop soup wasn't bad. Would I come back? No... not with the close proximity of better options.",

I've been going to Chinese restaurants since I can start eating, and I've always known service at Chinese restaurants to lack severely! This place is outside of this norm! Me and my sidekick was hungry and I pulled out my yelp app and saw this place at four stars. I've been craving fried rice so why not?  When we walked in, the hostess greeted us. Our waitress was an older lady that reminded me of my late grandma and she was so sweet. We ordered the Kung Pao chicken and house special fried rice. For drinks, they had happy hour beers for $2.75 and Mai Tais were $5 so I got that. That Mai Tai was strong, but good.  Another employee came by and asked us if we liked the food. It was fresh and delicious! The fried rice was amazing and it fulfilled my rice craving! When we were done, they gave us fresh, warm macaroons along with a fortune cookie. The macaroons were so damn good and something I've never been given at a Chinese restaurant so it was a nice surprise.  I was highly impressed for not just the food but the spectacular customer service! They made us feel so welcome there and I will definitely be back!",

The service here has always been fantastic every time my boyfriend and I have gone. They really have a knack for making you feel welcome and at home. They love customers with a good humor as well. The place itself is very cozy! it is always impeccably clean as well. It has a stand alone building location with it's own parking.   Now to get to the food..... Suffice to say, my mouth waters just thinking of this place. I absolutely LOVE it. The food is fantastic and the staff is so nice, they let me try as many things as I can turned vegetarian. I have never had an issue with getting sick from cross contamination. This place is SO vegetarian friendly. I personally recommend the Home Style Tofu (I believe that is what it is called, I'm not always the best with names but that should at least be close.).  My boyfriend has tried many of their meat dishes and gives them an A+ rating. This place is great for if you have mixed groups for dietary needs.   I recommend it to anyone wanting to have awesome food and friendly service. I love it here!",

I have been going to \"China Village\" since 1985 my family calls it \"Ben's\" because Ben was the first \"Honcho\" when it opened it used to be a Japanese Bar and Restaurant in the old days. \"China Village\" has the basics down and it always has, they have had the same Cook for years so everything is consistent and they train the new cooks well every now and then I can tell a different Cook is behind the scenes but not very often. Over the years I have probably tried everything on the menu I loved it all so be \"Bold\" try it If I were to name my favorites I would have to say nothing fancy the \"Hot and Sour Soup\", \"House Special Fried Rice\", \"Yu Shan Chicken\", \"Moo-Shu Pork\" extra Hoisin sauce,, \"Spicy Chicken and Shrimp\",  \"House Special Chicken with \"Shrimp\" extra cost \" and my all time favorite \"Steamed Whole Fish\" try everything these are just mine.

    "text": "I am giving 3 Stars  solely because the \"waiter with the bow tie\" helped us get through the ordeal of a meal at China Village. I regret to say that fellow Yelpers misled me into thinking I was going to get a good meal here.  Made hubby travel quite a distance to try this well reviewed restaurant.   Here's the scoop: They charge 1.50 for the noodles that every other restaurant routinely puts on the table.  They charge 1.50 for brown rice per person.   Ordered the PHO (a vietnamese soup) which is on the menu although it is a chinese restaurant. The soup which consisted of noodles, chicken and broth was accompanied by very, very fresh basil, cilantro, jalapenos, bean sprouts and lime.  Ample and fresh.  The soup broth, although it was chicken PHO, had a fishy backdrop taste.  Can't explain it but it was there.  Hubby gave it a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10.  Ordered the Walnut shrimp which was fried so much so that the batter had totally adhered to the shrimp. The crust outside the shrimp was much too thick.  The sauce was nothing more than mayonnaise.  The General Chicken which we had asked for extra spicy was not spicy at all.  When we told the waiter about it, he brought over some \"spicy oil\" to add to the dish to make it spicy.  Who wants to add oil to your food to make it spicy? Why not add chilies to the food while it is being sauteed as other restaurants do?  When the orders came out, the server only brought out one brown rice and that we should share it until we  get another one later.  The order of brown rice was small enough to fit in the palm of my small hand and the rice was as hard as a rock.  My culinary savvy told me that the rice had been overly microwaved and that's why it harden so much so that it was inedible. Don't restaurants keep rice in rice cookers to keep it warm??? We showed the waiter to which he said he would bring another rice, but by then we had already finished eating.  I also told him  that I hoped that he wasn't charging us  for that rice.  He said he would go back and modify the bill.  I was stupefied that the reduction was not done immediately considering that I showed him that the rice could bounce off a wall.   The straws I requested at the beginning of our meal never arrived and napkins were in short supply All in all the meal was second rate and I apologize to my hubby for sending him on a wild goose chase 15 miles away from our home thinking we were going to have a lovely Saturday night meal.  And by the way... this is no East Coast type restaurant... FAR from it!",

I understand he was elderly,  BUT HE WAS SCREAMING.  Not to mention the things he was shouting were totally inappropriate like 'kids seeing naked men for the first time' and 'where to buy dynamite'.    When I asked a waitress if she would say something to him, she just said \"he's been coming here for years, he just can't hear well\".  I understand that he's a regular,  but if they EVER want to gain any new regulars (like younger people who spend more money...) they need to tell this guy to QUIET DOWN!!!",

    "text": "I went to China Village for the first time today.  I was going to order my regular Mongolian Beef from Pei Wei, but I had a hankerin' for an egg roll and some egg drop soup, too.  It was lunchtime during the week, so I figured I could find a place with a lunch special which included all of those things.  I came across great reviews for China Village on Yelp, and did not feel compelled to look elsewhere.  I couldn't find a comprehensive (or solely take-out) menu online, so I ordered carry-out inside the restaurant.  The building is lilac, and boasts 2 signs out front.  The aroma once stepping inside was delicious!  I was greeted immediately upon my entrance, and asked the hostess for a takeout menu.  She was very kind, warm, didn't rush me, but waited at the register while I decided what to order.    I did not find exactly what I was looking for.  The lunch menu had 20 entree possibilities, ranging in price from $6.50 to $7.75, which included a vegetable egg roll, fried wonton, and fried rice.  No soup.  There was a rather comprehensive soup section in the menu (sizzling rice, wor wonton, hot & sour, egg flower, corn & cream, vegetables & bean curd, seafood), ranging in price from $6.25 to $7.95: one size only.  I asked the hostess if they had a smaller size soup - as I wasn't about to pay $7 for my lunch and another $7 for a gallon of soup - and she said that the smaller size is $5 and that it's better to get the larger size (demonstrating the difference in sizes with her hands).  To me, $5.00 was still too much, so I abandoned the soup idea at that point.  I settled on the Mongolian Beef lunch special, and it was ready in no time.  Seriously, I read one email on my phone, and was in mid-response when my order was ready!  It also smelled heavenly.    Upon returning to the office, I opened up the package, and actually laughed.  From reading other reviews on Yelp, I was expecting a feast of sorts.  Instead, I could barely see the egg roll, and the rice serving was a firm scoop.  One of the compartments in the serving tray was dedicated to sauces and fortune cookies (which I don't consider food).  I felt cheated, but the aroma was so inviting that I did not lose hope.    I tried the egg roll first.  It was light, juicy, and so so so flavorful!  I had never tasted one like this before.  My perspective began to change.  I am, traditionally, one who goes for cheap food, which frequently runs the risk of being nasty and/or dry.  So, it was very possible I was out of my element with China Village.  After finishing the egg roll, I wished that they had included an entire compartment of them!  (Or just made them 12 times larger.)  Next up was the main entree.  It had onions and green things (sorry, that's the best I can do) in it, which I quarantined to the non-food compartment.  The beef was thinly sliced and perfectly tender.  I felt ashamed eating it out of a Styrofoam container with a plastic fork.  The sauce was a savory, slightly sweet, gravy.  The fried rice had little highlights of egg in it, nothing else.  It, too, was perfectly moist.  After I had finished all of the beef, there still was ample sauce and rice left.  Until I ate it all, of course.  :-)  So, bottom line?  Although it was not what I was expecting (or looking for, to be honest), I would not hesitate to go there again.  It provided a level of pure food-eating-pleasure which I had never experienced with Chinese cuisine before.  I would highly recommend!",

Killing Zombies or actually being by the ocean.  But alas we are in a parking lot in 115 degree heat in Phoenix Arizona.  China Village is wonderful, one of the few places I would take an out of towner to.  Always solid food and prices.  Have not been let down yet!  Go China Village!  Woohoo! As good as it gets!

    "text": "This place is a classic Chinese restaurant that caters mainly to non-Chinese people. In fact a quick survey of the dining room as I sit in the foyer waiting for my take out order reveals only one Asian person out of about 25 and he looks more Mongolian than Chinese.  The food here is good. I have eaten here a few times and have always been pleased. The place is really old and kinda worn out inside, which I think is part of the charm.  They offer a fairly varied menu but when you choose to eat at a place like this it's for the standard fare: fried rice, noodles, chow mien, wanton soup, egg rolls etc. China Village serves it up hot and tasty! One of the other things I love about this place is that all the front of house staff are older Chinese ladies who seem to do as much vibrant chatting in their native language as they do speaking to the clientele. They are fast, efficient and friendly and if you order a large soup they will dish it out for you and your guests. Really good service.  I wouldn't want to look too closely in the nooks and crannies of this place as it needed remodeling about 20 years ago, but as I erstwhile stated, for myself the grungesqueness is part of the appeal somehow but you'd not catch me eating errant rice grains off the table.  Eat in or take out I have always enjoyed their  food and am a repeat customer!  China Village: it's about the food not the decor. Though the place is lit up outside like a Christmas festival! Enjoy!",

The food isn't great but isn't bad, enough that I think 3 stars is reasonable. The real winner was the hot and sour soup, its really hard to find a place that can make the soup properly and they have it down pretty good. Other than that the rest of our items were pretty average on the taste scale (orange chicken, house special chicken, bo-bo platter). The house special chicken sauce was a little watery for my liking. The egg rolls that came with the bo-bo platter were the \"premade frozen in a bag\" type and even though they tasted ok an egg roll is something simple enough that a restaurant can make really tasty if they would just spent some extra hours out of the week preparing and rolling them by hand. Also I'm used to having crab puffs come along with a bo-bo platter (or pupu platter, whatever a restaurant decides to call it) but what we got instead looked like fried wonton with a dot of meat inside it. Not a place I am dying on to return any time soon but the customer service and decor and feel the place has certainly deserves a visit sometime in the future.",

I actually ate with the early birds at 5:00pm and so the waitress seemed preoccupied with the regulars (which was fine--I got everything I needed without being constantly pestered with questions and such).  The waitress has a personality to herself---quite funny (and greatly dislikes highways), and has a bit of an accent but that just shows the authenticity of the place.  For a meal, I had the veggie egg rolls and Mongolian beef---both of which were good (not the greatest but far from the worst). For the price, it's hard to beat.  Highly recommended!!",

I've been dining here since 1991 and this place has CONSISTENTLY provided quality meals and great service. If you can count, that's about 22 years of good eats and affordable dine-out on a budget. The meals are authentic, no China Panda s***t here, no 'fusion' BS, either.  The chrysanthemum tea is excellent, and I recommend their bar if you're looking for a decent drink at a modest price. The layout hasn't changed since 1991, and I have reason to believe they haven't updated much of the furniture, but I go there to eat, not to gawk, so I'm good. I recommend this place to any foodie looking for a more exotic, yet authentic meal. Their lunch specials rock, unless you can do better elsewhere for six bucks!",

Granted the dinner portions are likely to be larger. From the outside of the restaurant it doesn't look like much. Inside awaits a friendly and professional staff, with a dimly lit atmosphere. I ordered the general chicken, lightly fried, very tasty. The egg drop soup is average. Ice water and hot herbal tea are a nice touch. The food doesn't seem \"healthy,\" everything seems either fried or sauced, but is a nice treat every now and then. I would return during lunch.",

I am giving them 5 stars for tasty food at a great price with very excellent accomodating service (not grading for ambiance- just be aware that the dining roomis pretty outdated but still comfortable). Where else can you go for Chinese food for dinner and get a dinner special for $12 or less that includes soup and three appetizers. While we were there our waiter also brought out some little extras to try including the special of the day as well as a fresh baked macaroon. Yum!  Update 9/2013 Ok, Chaina Village is still pretty cool but after trying a few more items on the menu I am less impressed by the ingredients as time goes on. Pretty sure they are using canned rather than fresh veggies and their meat is eh. Still tasty but not ideal.",

We were a party of seven and had so much fun spinning the lazy susan and trying all of our different dishes. They served us hot tea which was very nice too.   The owner/cook/manager kept us entertained and tried everything to accomodate my husband who has severe food allergies. At the end of our meal, he surprised us all with a delicious dessert that tasted like tiramisu. That was such a lovely touch. The decor is a plus for me, it hasn't been updated in a long time which I find comforting as I feel it's like stepping back in time to a more simple, peaceful time. My family will certainly be back!",

Most chinese restaurants always have efficient and courteous servers, but not here. One of the gentlemen even continually makes jokes with you while taking your order.  And after all these years, as I have indicated in my tip for this place, they have by far the best sweet and sour whole fish in the valley!  It is a personal treat for me to come here during those special occasions that are pertinent to me; such as a birthday or other significant events.  Today was no different. We just received excellent news, and my wife wanted me to treat myself, and she already knew where that would be. Yes, we can eat anywhere, and have visited many places all over.   However, until there is another place in town that serves a whole sweet and sour fish that is as scrumptious as this; this will be our go to place. It's been that way for as long as we have been married.  We ordered other things with it as well, such as the house special chicken, the chow fun noodles, and the house special fried rice. Everything was delicious, as always.  They even gave us coffee cake for dessert even though we didn't ask for it, and it wasn't bad.  The only bad thing was that they had a broken soda dispenser, and the diet pepsi was atrocious.  They kept asking and verifying if we were sure that we wanted the whole fish, and what size we wanted as they have a small, medium and large whole fish. Ours was a medium and ran $24, and the large one is around $36 or more. Make sure you call ahead an hour or more beforehand, as it takes that long to procure and prepare this delicacy.  All in all, you won't be disappointed with their offerings.",

Her lack of listening skills are dominating the ordering process as she talks over my wife and I while we attempt to ask questions about the menu. We order. While this is all happening we started to hear loud voices coming from the register area, lo and behold they are fighting with a dissatisfied customer. This spills into the dining area as servers now are all over the place coming up our table often to slam that dissatisfied customer. We're served a egg flower soup that was the best thing we had while we were there during this commotion. Egg roll arrives and it's a grease filled sponge of breading with no noticeable veggies/sprouts. We are served \"honey chicken \" which was reheated chicken wing covered in a zesty honey. This was so grey and old, the chicken chewed like jerky. While we sit here questioning whether we made a mistake by choosing this place, the unsatisfied customer situation continues to escalate. Personal attacks are flying back and forth. The entire staff and dissatisfied customer are involving all of the other guests in the area now..... our food arrives..ugh.  I ordered sweet and sour chicken and what is in front of me is overbreaded bite sized pieces of chicken that have been destroyed in old cooking oil. Flavor of old burnt oil mixed in with once again jerky like chewy chicken. The chicken fried rice my wife ordered is not fried, it's grey rice with over a steamed chicken topping. This is the end of our visit to China Village. We get up, express our dissatisfaction and walk to our car. There will be no argument here, don't do it!",

I chose from the dinner specials, the House Chicken and made it spicy and added extra veggies. I thought there would be more veggies than I got but my chicken portion was huge. I found them from looking at the photos on yelp and the food is as good as it looks in al of the pictures! I do have to say again the service was great. I can see why they've been in business for so long! A must try!",

From the moment you walk expect a warm welcome and attentive personalized service.  The menu items are traditional Chinese. The flavors of each item ordered was delightful and unique. Dinner combos are a bit pricey for valley Chinese, $15-$17, but I say the exemplary service is worth it.  The head chef, owner will personally make a visit to inquire about the quality and taste of your orders.  I would highly recommend. 4 out of 5 stars for price point.",

My husband decided to call to let them know we weren't happy with the food. They told him to bring it back. When he brought it back he was met with full blown aggression and the manager raising his voice at him to make sure others in the restaurant know this is what he does - he goes around buying food and taking it back every where. What?? Then it gets crazier. They threaten to call the police and start taking pictures of him. Never in my life have I heard of such craziness. So for the food I might have given them a 3 since it was fresh. But overall - for craziness they get 1 star. Just stay away - who knows what you may see.",

I had ordered crab puffs, fried rice, and general tso chicken (comes with white rice). The crab puffs barely had any cream cheese or crab meat in them, it was basically just the outer shell. Some of the chicken didn't have any sauce on it. The fried rice had no vegetables, it only had a little bit of egg and was very bland.

The waitress was just as attentive. At the end of my meal, the chef brought over a mini coconut macaroon that he warmed up. It was quite delicious.  As for my meal, I would give it 3 stars. The food was decent but it didn't blown me away. I got the beef chow fun lunch special. If came with 2 fried wontons, an egg roll, a small appetizer sized soup, and I opted for fried rice. The egg roll and soup were pretty good, but I thought the fried rice and fried wontons were really bland. The chow fun had a nice texture and the right balance of noodles to meat. I prefer more noodles than meat though, so if you're into a lot of meat, you might be underwhelmed. Maybe. Maybe not. The sauce on the noodles needed just a little bit more flavor. As soon as I added a smidgen of soy sauce and hot sauce, it was good for me.   The decor is a bit dark since there aren't any windows. I don't know why so many buildings in the valley are built this way.   I would say, give this place a shot. I'll try it at least one more time and try another dish, since it was decent.",

Service was super friendly. They have cute little cups of tea as well, which I enjoyed.   Fast forward to last week, we ordered take out and I swear it was like a completely different experience. I ordered orange chicken & my boyfriend ordered the house special chicken. The chicken was reallly dry. The breading was literally falling off in chunks and they barely gave us any rice. We also ordered the egg drop soup again, and it was amazing. But the chicken was just so bad that we ended up not eating all of it.

Now granted the only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because of the fact that it desperately needs a remodel.   The food is excellent and the service is seriously so good, you almost want to tuck one of your little Asian servers in your pocket and take them home with you and make them an indentured servant of some sort or slave.  But on a serious note, this is one of those hidden little gems you almost don't want to yelp about due to the fact that you don't want a ton of people to find about it and ruin it.",

I love egg foo yung and order it in two of our favorite Chinese restaurants...this was like a wet sponge, with the consistency of oatmeal.  Never had anything like this before.  The restaurant is in need of a makeover and is very outdated.  I can see keeping the charm of an older restaurant...but this really needs a facelift. The employees were very nice and helpful...but there is definitely a breakdown in the language barrier.  There are definitely better choices if you like old time traditional Chinese fare.",

We were seated right away and was brought water and the waitress already had her pad asking what we wanted to eat, we didn't even have a chance to look at the menu yet, I told her not yet and asked for a straw for my water, she came right back with it and asked if we were ready yet. I said no to give us a few minutes. They had two lunch menu's on the table in the plastic holders, was confused as to why that was. We ordered from their lunch menu they gave us, and was brought out soup right away, was warm not hot. I was not happy with what I ordered, the house chicken which is to be coated and crispy with a gravy, it was a little too crispy, tasted old like maybe they reheated it and hardly any gravy, dry for the most part. My friend had some kind of beef with veges and she said it was watered down, the beef looked like it was paper thin like from a deli. NOT GOOD at all, we were rushed the whole time we were there. Also another two ladies came in and one ordered what was the special noted on their menu board when you walked in, the waitress said there was not that for a special, that lady had to get up to show her!!!! really. I was not happy with this place at all and would never go back there.",

There wasn't a vegetable to speak of in the yui shan chix, it was bland, rubbery and swimming in a thick heavy syrup.  Yuck - we will not go back and will never order delivery.  Yuck, Yuck",

    "text": "We just stumbled into this place on a trip to Phoenix last weekend.  Maybe it's a matter of taste in view of the other review on this page,  but we thought this place serves GREAT Chinese, with excellent attentive service and excellent prices, (although I'm used to LA prices and Phoenix is generally more economical across the board.)  We opted for  the fixed menu dinner, which we usually do not do, and the selections were very good.  The moo-shu pork was my favorite, although the rest of the dishes were also outstanding. There is a wonderful garlic chicken dish.  They put a little hibachi on the table so we could cook our own little skewers of beef.  We liked the very hearty soup. I did not notice any of the downside aspects noted in the other review.  The outside is not much to look at, just a rather plain free-standing building, but the interior decor is right out of the 50's, like the old style Cantonese places back then.  They play quiet Chinese music in the background, a nice touch that enhances the experience.  Plenty of parking and a bar if you like that sort of thing.  Thanks for a great evening, China Village !  UDATE:  Dropped in again a few months later- just to see if the quality stayed up- and it was as good as before.  They even recognized us from months earlier.  We had the fixed menu dinner for six and they were very cooperative in making some changes based on our tastes.  Thanks again..  China Village.",

The waiter asked \"how spicy 1-10, or do you want 12...?\" semi jokingly. I got the 12, he was calling it Presidents dad's chicken, (I guess they call the 10 presidents chicken). This stuff was SOOO spicy, exactly what I wanted/needed. They kept refilling my water because they knew it was going to be drained quickly. Definitely recommend this spot for anyone that really enjoys spicy food.",

    "text": "When we first moved to Phoenix, my boyfriend and I were looking for a good authentic Chinese restaurant to go to. We saw that China Village was close to our apartment and decided to call ahead and order our food. He ordered extra spicy chicken fried rice without any onions and I ordered beef broccoli and I asked if I could swap the white rice for the fried rice the late on the phone was extremely rude and sighed and rudely said no. I completely understood but was just shocked at the customer service. Anyways was still hoping for the best.   So we went to go pick up this food, while I was there I asked how long it would take for a SIDE of chicken fried rice she said no way. But then I was told to wait for it, we had just finished grocery shopping so was in a hurry to leave (this summer Arizona heat don't play). So I said never mind I was in a hurry she rudely said \"I already told the chef\" when In fact she had not even left the register (-.-) I said fine since she had already charged me.   Got home and ate, food was mediocre. Even asking for extra spicy, it was not even spicy. Broccoli was soggy like it had been there for a while, meat was tough to eat through. Would not ever stop again as it was also pretty pricey.   Advice for management is teach customer service skills. Don't assume the consumer knows your entire menu and don't give attitude when questions are asked. Especially since the restaurant was empty at the time and there was no rush.",

Reminded me of being a kid and having hot tea at Chinese dinners with my family. We ordered the house chicken and swept and sour chicken dinner specials and the potstickers. The potstickers were delicious! Tasted just like the ones I love in Chinatown in NYC! The egg drop soup was very flavorful. The crab puff was SO rich in the best way possible. Rice was jasmine and super fluffy. Both entrees were flavorful and filling! We will be back and highly recommended!",

It didn't compare but it was still good. One thing I really liked was as soon as we sat down they brought us water and hot tea.   We started off with the dumplings. They were good but their sauce needed more soy sauce added. Then we got the sizzling rice soup w extra $2 sizzling rice. Pretty good. The soup base tasted like chicken noodle soup but the sizzling rice came out perfect! Loved all the extra veggies and shrimp in the soup.  For our main entrees, I got the Kung pao shrimp and my husband got beef n broccoli. Kung pao shrimp was good but a little disappointed it wasn't spicy at all. And it had a little bit of sweet taste which was a first for me ordering a Kung pao dish. The beef n broccoli was good. The beef looked a little thin so was worried about the quality but it was soft and tender.  Overall everything was good and moderately priced. Will come back here again!!",

    "text": "BUYER BEWARE!  I would give them zero stars if I could!   DO NOT order take-out from here based on their online menu.   First off their online menu is very limited compared to what they actually offer. Online it shows maybe 15 items, in truth they serve 50+ different things.   Also the prices are all 100% inaccurate. Items listed for $4.50 in truth were $9, items listed at $7.50 were in fact $10-11.50  We ordered take out for our family of 6 and based on the prices assumed the portions were small so we got more than we would normally order.   We ordered the following items:  Cream Cheese Rangoon's (large compared to most places but cold chewy, not crunchy and only came with one small side of sweet and sour for 8 large Rangoon's) 2 orders Honey Dipped Chicken Wings (tough, chewy, sauce nothing to write home about) Kung Pao Chicken (just ok) House Special Chicken (just ok) BBQ Pork Fried Rice (BBQ pork was basically non existent in this dish)  The total based on prices listed online should have been around $36 plus tax. We paid $59, which for the portions sizes is reasonable but when you're expecting to pay $36 plus tax and then on top of it the food is mediocre, it really blows.  When I confronted the person taking our payment about the discrepancy she replied that they \"don't have online menu.\"  UMMMM.... I beg to differ, not only do you have a website that lists this very limited menu but also your menu is on google and on yelp so you most certainly do have several versions of an online menu. If you no longer update any of this information it might be helpful to let customers calling in TO GO orders know that is the case.   In short, we will never be back and are appalled.   Her final thoughts as she swiped my card seeing how shocked I was at the food I ordered not realizing it was enough to feed 10 adults? \"At least you'll have some for tomorrow.\"   Do yourself a favor and try China Chili on 3rd St North of Flower instead, the food is miles better than this and their online menu and pricing is accurate and customer service is amazing. Also I've never been into China Chili and seen it COMPLETELY empty. I should have known better when we walked in to pick it all up and there wasn't a soul to be found.",

The outside of the restaurant leaves much to be desired and the inside isn't fancy by any means. The people that run the restaurant are super friendly and nice and even had us laughing throughout the meal. They had a good sense of humor and I can appreciate that. Our food was served hot and really delicious. The complimentary hot tea was a nice touch. I would highly recommend the beef chow fung noodles. Our dishes came with soup and some various appetizers including a chicken wing, spring roll and a crab Rangoon. The chicken wings were really crispy and had a sticky honey sauce on them that was very good. I'd consider ordering these as an appetizer. You definitely won't go hungry here, they make sure you have plenty of food!",

    "text": "We've been going to this restaurant for about 2 years now. As a little background story, it is family owned and operated. The family immigrated to the US but first spent some time in Vietnam, thus the Vietnamese dished on the menu in addition to the Chinese.   The place is indeed a bit antiquated in decor but it really makes up for it in food-flavor. The best way to enjoy this place is to go there with a few people and eat the food family-style. Sometimes you get to sit in the big booth table with the lazy-Susan. The last time I was there, I sat with a group of 7 people and each person ordered a different dish.   My favorites are the House-Chicken which is a lightly battered and fried, and then they pour a light sweet-soy type sauce over it. The hot and sour soup is also very tasty. You can order it extra spicy if you want. It has all kinds of veggies, and shrimp, pork and tofu as well. Another good choice is the fried rice they make: pork or house fried rice are quite delicious. Oh and I almost forgot the walnut shrimp. OMG! DELICIOUS!!!!!!! My pregnant sister can't have enough of that.  The servers sometimes make fruit drinks that they hand out with crushed ice. I'm not sure if we get those because they know us or just because. We usually have water to drink so I can't comment on soda-pricing.   The waiters/waitresses have accents because they were not born in the US. Some people should just get over that.   I've been telling other friends about this place and I'll expect to go there again in the next few weeks.",

We ask to speak with a manager, there's no manager there so we have to call him. My boyfriend is on the phone with this guy for 20 minutes arguing with him, when he's not even there in person to see or understand what's going on. It wasn't a big deal what so ever until the restaurant made it into one. I couldn't believe this place. At this point we just want our money back. The total was about $35, so we weren't walking away without a refund for the food we didn't eat. About 30 minutes later we finally got our money back. Will never be coming back to this place again.",

While I waited I was offer hot tea, which was a great gesture of customer service. Since I believe my order to be ready momentarily I declined the offer. The soups were piping hot and packaged to go not sooner after. The Hot and Sour definitely had more vegetables than I am used but was very hearty. The breakout star was definitely the Egg Flower soup as my mouth is extremely happy as this one also had a great deal of vegetables. Needless to say, I will return for dine in service very soon!",

They seem to over-fry, the chicken and pork morsels in the dishes were a little tough and the fried wanton had a dark-gray center.  But I could see the potential in the sauces.  If only they would control the fryer a little, it would be almost excellent..  The prices look pretty decent.  I'm going to try Jade Palace next and see how they compare to pick my go-to place!",

If you're looking for something more on the authentic side, you'll have to keep searching... but if you seek Americanized Chinese food, it's pretty good.    Your best bet is having one of their lunch specials which features an egg roll, a fried wonton, egg fried rice, plus entree for $7-8.  The portions for it are generous and the food is made to order and fresh.  I have also been to this establishment for dinner with a couple of my friends eating family style and everything we had was rather tasty.    Although the decor is outdated and reminds me of a stereotypical 80s Chinese restaurant, what they lack in decor they make up for in service.  Their staff is friendly, patient, and kind.  They even recognized my friends since they've been there a few times now, which is always a plus.  Only disappointment for me is their lack of Cantonese style chow mein and chow fun.  Now if only I could find a place with amazing fresh chow fun... The search continues!",

We sat down, we were served some tea, and not too long after, a sweet woman came by to take our order.   My heart was set on orange chicken, which was not on the menu. I decided to ask anyway, and she happily responded \"we'll make it...just for you!\"   I really really really wanted to like the food here, but I didn't. To be fair, I am partial to another Valley restaurant to satiate my Chinese food cravings.   The food lacked flavor and didn't have that \"authentic\" feel to it. I mean, I've never been to China personally, but I'd imagine there would be more flavor involved in the dishes.   The only reason I rated this place so high is because of the service. Everyone that we interacted with was just so nice and funny. One of the gentlemen there made some jokes, wished us a merry Christmas, and gave us candy canes. Super sweet! Good customer service is very important to me and will make or break a place for me.   Bottom line - you know that sweet auntie or cousin you have that loves to entertain and cook dinners for you, but you don't have the heart to tell them you don't like their cooking? That's what this place reminds me of.",

Mongolian beef ( Was WWAAYYY over cooked and had no flavor) and the Twice cooked pork ( Very oily and greasy ...and that's pretty much what it tasted like).

(AKA not the most authentic Chinese I've ever eaten, but certainly pretty decent when you're in the mood for standard fare like General Tso's chicken, chow mein or beef and broccoli.)  Another plus: this is one of the only Chinese restaurants in the Arcadia-Biltmore area that delivers.   I'm giving China Village three stars for inconsistency. The first time I ordered delivery from them, my (vegetarian) Pho was quite literally amazing. The broth, which came in its own plastic container, tasted flavorful and comforting. But the really incredible part was the fresh veggies I received in a separate styrofoam container. (When you eat Pho, the broth is intended to be poured over the veggies, which then cook in the hot liquid.) They were so fresh and beautiful that they looked as though they jumped out of the pages of a culinary magazine. Due to the freshness  and selection of the produce that came with the Pho, my meal was incredible.   I don't know who was cooking in the kitchen at China Vullage that day, but I don't think that person's been back since. Ever since that first Pho order, subsequent orders have just been \"meh.\" And no other dish comes close to equalling the quality or complexity of that first magical Pho order.",

The reviews were mostly positive, describing this place as funky old-school chinese, and chinese food for non-chinese people, haha! Americanized Chinese, Perfect! Yeah, it's a bit out of date, and reminded me of the chinese restaurant scene from Cheech & Chong's Nice Dreams (82), minus Pee-Wee Herman and Cheech & Chong... So far as I could tell, the reviews were accurate. We had Yut Shan Eggplant and Hunan Chicken, both were very tasty and came with a big bowl of rice and a big pot of hot tea was included too (remember when that was standard, before they started charging $3.79 per cup of tea?). Prices for dinner were a little higher than expected, nonetheless, large portions so you will likely be taking home leftovers. I really want to return for the lunch specials because it sounds like more items are included for one price. This place reminded me of the (no-doubt Americanized) Chinese places that I grew up with, most of which are now gone and have been replaced with trendy, snobbish 'bistros' that will charge you $30 a plate without batting an eye. China Village is more of a family joint, at one point half of the staff had surrounded a table with a young family, were teaching the kids chinese words, and then told the parents that their kids were going to be working in the kitchen - I think they believed it! Funny as hell, you had to be there... certainly a light-hearted, fun atmosphere and everyone looked to be having a great time.",

However, we have issues every time we place an order by phone.   The first time, I was told that the lunch special has soup, but that it would not be included on delivery orders. I then asked if the price would be less since part of the special would not come with the meal but they said no. I let that roll off my shoulder and accepted the delivery order.   The second time, the lady said they didn't deliver to our office and said the order would only be available for pick up. I explained that we have had delivery ordered before, but she said they were too busy and that we should call back later.   My final straw - 5 of us were ordering and 3 of us had credit cards. She said we should put the whole order on one credit card because they don't make money by running more than one. I am baffled that this restaurant would rather save money on credit card fees than to accept different methods of payment. Needless to say, our weekly office Chinese order will be from a different establishment.",

But the crab puffs, now these were fluffy fried pieces of crab and cream cheese heaven!! Ordered the small and wish we got the large.  Entrees: I got the Chicken with veggies (spicy) and he had the hong kong chicken.  The Hong Kong chicken wasn't on the menu but we saw it on Yelp and asked if they could make it.

    "text": "The place definitely looks iffy on the outside, but I'm so glad I stopped in! Typical Chinese restaurant atmosphere, dark but nice. My mom went to the bathroom and said it was very clean.   The food was amazing- I ordered the Hawaiian chicken and the crab wontons and my mom custom ordered something with seafood with a dark, spicy sauce (I'm not sure what), with brown rice.   My main review is for the awesome gentleman who served us. He was SO NICE and was so willing to work with my (admittedly difficult) mother who didn't want anything sweet, can't eat meat, doesn't like this, doesn't like that. He was so tolerant and they were able to whip her up a custom dish with shrimp that she just loved. That alone would make me come back.  Another plus- the food tastes EXACTLY THE SAME when reheated in the microwave two days later! How often does that happen? I will definitely be back!",

The one thing that I can say that made our visit stand out is the service. They really appreciate your business they're very courteous and kind. Nowadays that's hard to come by. When you have a good experience you return. Try them out next time you're in the area.",

    "text": "This week the Jolly Diners went to China Village. We started out with vegetable egg rolls and crab rangoons. The main courses were egg foo yung for my sister, sweet and sour chicken for my mother, vegetable chow mein for my brother-in-law, and vegetable chow mein for me; with the addition of tofu. Everything was prepared and served expertly. The wait staff served us China black tea and beverages right away. They offered help on the specials and they were great throughout the meal. I didn't know what chow-fung noodles were and so they brought me a small dish of chow-fung noodles to try. Both the service and the food were delicious and reasonably priced. If you have a family, you're on a date, or you just want a really good Chinese meal - then try China Village. It's very obvious this team of professionals had been doing this for some time.  The Jolly Diners rated China Village at an overall 5 out of 5. Hope you enjoy it the same way we did.",

I made a special trip today and it was worth it.   If you're ever feeling under the weather, the soup here works miracles. Specifically : wor wonton soup, Hong Kong style. Just add half a bottle of sriracha and you'll be good to go.   On top of the delicious menu, the service here is fantastic. I would go so far as to say I adore it. I haven't been here in several weeks, yet he not only remembered me, but the exact soup that I ordered. Fantastic.   I haven't been in with a group; it's just the two of us that dine here. Our drinks, food, and check always arrive in a timely fashion.",

The food doesn't differ too much from place to place. What separates China Village from most of the other places I've had is that you can tell that it is their goal to cook with love, for lack of a better term. We got crab wontons, won ton soup, shrimp & chicken with garlic sauce, and general tsos chicken. Everything we had was a notch above most other Chinese takeout places. It just had that extra touch of caring. They're not reinventing the wheel, they're just doing a very good job at what they do. We even got glasses of water brought to us unprovoked in the lobby when we were waiting for our takeout. Will go back for sure.",

I appreciated that they serve up the take out orders in a box as opposed to a bag. Why haven't more places thought of this?  I had the vegetable moo shu and it was fantastic. The vegetables weren't oily, just well seasoned and cooked perfectly.   My boyfriend had the general tso chicken and said it was maybe the best he's ever had. It wasn't overly breaded like many are and, I quote, \"You can tell there's actually chicken in there.\"   Apparently they have a good happy hour which I plan to check out. $5 scorpion bowls?

    "text": "Sitting here now still waiting for our bill after another 2 hour unmitigated Christmas disaster of extremely poor service and a disorganized mess. I'm typing this review at the end of a 2 hour dinner that felt like a 7 day cruise.   Yes we know Christmas here is mushuganah. But we arrived an hour after opening (early) and ordered Peking duck and 2 other dishes and some potstickers. Nothing too crazy mind you.   So we arrived at 4:30.   Since then we've been here impatiently tapping our fingers. Potstickers took 75 minutes to arrive - after I complained to the harried waitstaff (you could tell they were harried as I could hear them yelling in Chinese from the kitchen at each other throughout the night).   After 60 minutes the waitress came out and said they had inexplicably run out of duck. The ole 86 - just 2 hours after opening on Christmas Day. Go figure. Ok we sighed...we'll get mushu chicken instead.   Then we waited. And waited. And waited.   We've had their potstickers here before and they were usually pretty good - but these tasted half cooked and doughy.   About 1:45 minutes after ordering two dishes arrived - not the three ordered. Oops forgot the mushu chicken.   What drove us truly nuts was watching many tables get served while we twiddled our fingers. Quite a few arrived 30-40 minutes after our arrival yet somehow they were served 1st. That led us to think the issue was more our disorganized and inattentive waitress than the admittedly busy kitchen.   Food tasted fine - not as good as past years.  Bottom line is that this will our last and final visit to China Village. They just can't seem to get it together. We didn't leave a tip - took another 25 minutes after eating to clear the table and get the tab.",

Today it is Christmas and we were too tired to cook dinner so we decided to get some Chinese takeout and I ordered chicken with broccoli and ended up with a soupy looking chicken dish that had green peppers in it. I did not eat it. My husband ordered sweet and sour shrimp and said it was terrible. The chow Mein was the only dish that tasted somewhat good. The restaurant was busy so I am assuming that's why the food was so horrible, however I don't believe that is an excuse especially when I'm spending money for a restaurant to cook my meal. I hope this never happens again and if it does I will not be eating at China Village ever again.",

Hubby ordered the Tangerine Beef (breaded meat in a thick brown sauce with a slight kick of spice)... I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken (thinly sliced chicken in a sauce that isn't as thick with peanuts and green onions). Both were great. We also ordered the Bo Bo plate for two... which is a fun way to try several apps in one. You also get hot tea and plenty of perfectly-cooked, sticky white rice with your meal. We spent less than $40 with the tip... and we both left happy with two boxes of leftovers. (So if you don't want leftovers... definitely share!)  We had to laugh at the music. It had to be Disney princess songs in Chinese.... or some sort of compilation of love ballads. Totally cheesy... but worth it for the food. And, the staff was lovely. Very attentive, definitely authentic, and sweet as can be.  I haven't yelped in years, honestly... but this little spot (combined with some free time I haven't had in awhile) prompted me to log in and write a review!",
