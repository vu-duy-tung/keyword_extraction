    "text": "Eggstasy is a local breakfast concept with a chic and refreshing interior, coupled by a surprisingly unique menu. The staff are young and friendly, serving an increasingly larger clientele. On the weekends, it's not uncommon to find Eggstasy customers queuing out the door, hoping to get a table inside.   This area desperately needed a local breakfast place worth going to. Now we don't have to commute south to Arcadia to find palatable breakfast cuisine   Make sure to try the Dali Skillet if you like spicy chorizo and eggs!",

I noticed various groups of different sizes being called, all that were way after us, and checked twice to make sure we hadn't been called after waiting 45 minutes... After an hour we just left as we were so hungry. Granted it was Sunday around noon, it was still ridiculous with being told a timeframe 1/3 of what we were waiting and the host would only say to me \"I don't think we called you\" any time I asked about wanting to check and seeing how long it'd be. I give him slack because it was so busy but it sucked waiting an hour and then just leaving.",

Yum!  The only reason I didn't rate this place higher was because of the cleanliness (or lack thereof).  On a not-so-busy Tuesday morning, we were sat next to an unbussed table that remained that way through our entire meal. The outdoor couches needed a good wipe and the fixtures were void of any light bulbs giving the space a very unfinished look. The restrooms were also in need of attention and they always say the cleanliness of a restaurant's restroom is an indication of the cleanliness of its kitchen. Just a listing sprucing up would make the experience much more pleasing.",

    "text": "They have a really cool layout with an open kitchen, an inner dining area that is kind of industrial-like in design and an outer dining area that is open to the inside, separated by the bar.   Try the juice; it is DELICIOUS. Freshly squeezed and no additives, just plain pure fruit pulp. Yum.  I had the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes, which were okay.  They tasted kind of pumpkin-y, and the cheesecake \"sauce\" was a nice change to the usual old maple syrup routine.  The problem I have with sweet pancakes, though, is that they're mostly indistinguishable from one another.  All the \"fruity\" sweet pancakes taste the same, and same goes for all of the \"other\" types - chocolate based, dessert based, what have you.  The good thing is that the pancakes are ginormous - like the size of a regular dinner plate - and you get FOUR of them.  Probably will go again, and I'm thinking of either getting something savory or going for one of the fruitier sweet breakfast options, like the lemon blueberry compote french toast.  The wait is LONG. You might as well just suck it up and chill at the bar, unless you have a ginormous group or a bunch of kids.  Parking is decent since this brunch place is located in one of those weird plaza areas like EVERYTHING else in Arizona.",

When we ordered mimosas, one of the girls I was with ordered a pineapple mimosa (because pineapple juice was listed on the menu). The server Danielle was friendly and very polite. After she took our order, someone in a red shirt, I assume the manager came over and said, \"I'm sorry your server is so ignorant she doesn't even know we don't have pineapple juice.\" - in the rudest tone you could imagine. I just think it's so unprofessional to speak about your employees like that.  Now on to the moist bread and under cooked potatoes. The food was mediocre so say the least. The only pleasant surprise was the cucumber water. I would have to say I will never go back to a restaurant that treats their employees like that.",

The corn beef hash could have come from a can, the croque madame needed way more bechemal for the mountain of bread, the bene was fine and the eggs OK. THe standout was the bacon which was fantastic overall - I would come back to try the chocolate bacon but that would be it.

So I ordered a shrimp salad. A few minutes later the manager came to me to apologize but they are out of shrimp. Im not sure how a kitchen doesnt communicate this to staff????

I told the waiter, and he did not apologize, he just said, \"that is a hair\" and took my plate with the eggs. He came back and said that he would have a new egg out shortly... it never came. I had to ask for water 3x because he kept forgetting, along with ketchup. My friend said her burrito was amazing, meanwhile my food was okay. I think the service put a bad taste in my mouth. The bill came, and I still tipped the guy because that is who I am. I told the manager and she was very friendly, and apologized to me for the poor service.  She even gave me a 20.00 gift certificate to make up for it. She was very professional and I appreciated that. However, I am a first impression kind of gal, so I gave the gift certificate to my friend. I probably won't go back.

The owner, Joe(?), is very accommodating and understands what it means to have a new concept in Scottsdale restaurants. Unfortunately, he needs better staff. Being from the east coast I often criticize how customer service is a dying breed but maybe it's simply because I'm more towards the west coast and everyone is just used to giving only 60%. I rarely witness Quick To Serve experiences. This place is one of them. The hostesses will be two young girls looking around not knowing what tables are available while what appeared to be Joe's mother yelling at them in a thick foreign accent and they just don't even budge. Our sever was awful and as excited as we were to bring our friends to this restaurant, they were so upset about the service that they will not come back. It upsets me because I know yelp is an easy access for bad reviews and rarely do you get a good one, however, I hope Joe takes the coaching and witnesses the staff and makes changes. Our server not once refilled our drinks, when I had to tell her to refill the drinks she didn't even clear the empty ones. Food was forgotten and not brought out and we had to ask to remove it from our bill, and then when she brought the bill after not clearing our dishes, it was one check. We asked her to split it three ways and she throws the empty plates back on the table to walk back and change the bill. It took everything in me not to coach her on the spot and I just felt it wouldn't go far enough had I not given the owner the direct experience. I was embarrassed. I love this restaurant but if we keep receiving bad service, it won't be worth the trouble to come back.",

    "text": "We came here today for the first time. The reviews looked great and it's super close to our house. The experience started out really well. There was a 30 min wait for 11:15am on a Sunday and the host was very nice, we told her we were going to look around in the kids store (KidStop) to keep our 4 & 2 year old occupied, she was so nice to walk down there to get us when our table opened up she sat us and our waitress greeted us promptly. We took about 10 min to order because it was our first time and the menu is pretty big with lots of delicious looking items. We then ordered, nothing complicated but this is when the problems began....an HOUR went by and we still didn't have our food and ALL the tables around us that ordered after us were getting their food. I was a restaurant manager before and I know that's not acceptable.  I went to try to get our waitress but she was avoiding us like we weren't her table. Another server brought my meal by itself and we waited 5 min before I sad anything to our waitress and she assured me the rest of the food was on its way. I told her just get my kids food out (it was just 2 Mickey Mouse pancakes) b/c they were hungry. Well we waited another 5 min before the rest of the food came out. The manager walked by and asked how everything was so we told him nicely and his response was, sorry! I know it's not an excuse but our kitchen is slammed! Said nothing and did nothing. After waiting for over an hour and for how hungry we were I would have expected the food to taste amazing but it was bland and disappointing. We will not be going back for $70 for 2 adults and 2 kids! If you want amazing breakfast food go to Butterfields. Their wait to get a table might be longer but Butterfields food comes out in 5 min from when it's ordered and the food is delicious and consistent. I don't know how Butterfields kitchen is so efficient but Eggstasy needs to take note from their operations and table turn. Long story short Eggstasy was not worth the wait or $ for the quality of food and the lack of care with the manager and server. And the thing that made me most upset is the issue was never addressed or acknowledged. We had to say something in order to get a lame excuse.",

They were dry around the edges. I can get better crepes elsewhere. They had the roll up doors open that lead out to the patio. I really wanted to drink hot coffee with my breakfast but it was too hot to do that. It was 99 degrees that day. It was way too hot to have them open, not sure what they were thinking. Or open them in the morning and close them when it gets hot. My mom did not like her food either. Service was mediocre. I won't be going back. I'll stick with Butterfield's.",

Our party of two waited 25 minutes to be seated at the bar alongside people who arrived after but we're seated before us. We were greeted by three of the 8 or so people working behind the bar, none of whom offered us any beverages until I had asked three times for water and coffee. (Our server actually argued with me about my request stating that being seated is not a guarantee of fast service.) The beef brisket biscuits and gravy we ordered was actually sausage gravy, and the truffle French toast with asparagus and fried egg was good but not great. The highlight was the coffee, but not even that was worth the wait and poor service.",

The Whole Wheat French toast is to be avoided, it came off the light menu.  It is a whole wheat bread in egg whites with fresh fruit.  What I got was 3 thick pieces of bread VERY lightly toasted with almost no egg on them at all.  The fruit is dumped onto the bread (not mentioned in item description).  So what you end up with is toast with syrup.  The decor is, well there is none.  The walls are all completely blank of any and everything.  I do not even remember a mirror in the bathroom.  As I was leaving I almost got knocked over by a waitress as she bulled past me without even looking up or acknowledging she almost hit me.  I was sad because I really wanted to like this place.  I may go again and see if it changes or if it was just a bad day.  Oh and the place was so insanely loud and noisy that it was hard to speak to the people at my table.",

I even had to point out the syrup on the floor after I watched the server spill it 15 minutes earlier (and yes she knew she spilled it) but never cleaned it up. WHAT HAS HAPPENED?!

The pancakes tasted very bland, like they just made it with flour and water.

Food was fine but not great...we had the smoked salmon Benedict and a breakfast flatbread. Ordered a kids breakfast for my kids and they brought out both breakfasts on the same dish?!?!  Maybe the cook doesn't have kids but children don't really like to eat their meals off the same plate...had to get a separate dish to split the breakfasts.  I will say the pancakes are good and it has a nice indoor outdoor trendy atmosphere but not enough to make us return.",

I ordered the gypsy skillet and my daughters order French toast with bacon and a scramble with mushrooms bacon cheese and avocado. The later was a special order bc they didn't have exactly what my daughter wanted. They had no problem accommodating us. Very nice. Once we ordered we started to wait. And wait. And wait. And wait. The food took a long time to come out. Another two tables got their food before us even though we had ordered first. When our food finally came, thank goodness, it was yummy. The gypsy skillet is delicious and the skirt steak is tender and cook perfectly. Both my daughters were happy with their food also. So even though we waited a long time for our food, it ended being good. We will try this place again. I am giving it three stars because of the long wait for our food.",

First, drink order seemed to confuse the waiter and the bar staff, they were both lost on our mocha, oj, and 2 kids chocolate milk??? ok, is that hard? Geez. Fine, food ordered. Our waiter seemed young and confused (not the best, but he tried I guess). Food took forever due to \" well done skirt steak takes a long time\" umm why? Got the food about 40 mins later and I received a burnt piece of dry thin steak and my 6 yr old received raw burgers. Food got sent back only to receive 1 of 2 burgers raw again, My steak was fixed and much better, however food had no seasoning. Steak, burgers, and hash browns were super bland and cold might I add. Oh and the cherry on top? No AC and no fans on! It was 100+ degrees out. This place has so much potential and I do want to come back. Pancakes and french toast were very good. Staff and cooks need to be improved. Overall meh experience. They did take the kids burgers off the bill, but still doesn't change my review.",

We split a two egg breakfast with turkey sausage, since we like a light breakfast, and it was delicious and cooked perfectly. The hash browns were crispy and the turkey sausage was amazing, not your typical Jimmy Dean sausage link. To top it off, the sourdough toast is some of the best we've had. We will definitely be back.

Our waitress seemed very disorganized and messed up multiple things with both my order & my sisters.   She told me the roasted veggie scramble came with mozzarella cheese, but it came with cheddar. I was too hungry to send it back to be fixed. My sister's \"skinny b****\" (healthy breakfast burrito) was completely soggy and soaked through from the watery egg whites. And instead of getting turkey sausage in it, she got turkey bacon. Very odd. Overall the food was okay, but definitely nothing special. There are plenty of better options in the area.   Lastly, we sat outside and it was a really hot day. We waited for a long time for our waters to be refilled multiple times, even though other tables had carafes of water on their tables. I really want this place to be good, but it's just a disappointment. Don't waste your time and head somewhere with better service & food.",

The steak was cooked to medium (what I asked for) and was really good. My friend tried the corned beef hash and eggs with pancakes. The corned beef hash looked like the canned version, but you could tell by the taste it wasn't, had good flavor, but not my favorite texture. The pancakes were delicious, nice and fluffy and very sweet, almost like cake.   I will definitely be back and looking forward to trying one of the benedict's with another mimosa!",

Update: I love going out for breakfast and have been to most of the hot spots in the area - but I always come back here. This restaurant is a real standout and has a personality and character all it's own.   Something new: not a big fan of how they've started playing loud music in the morning. It's a very large and open space and the muffled pop music adds a lot of extra noise.",

Depending on what you like, sweet or savory breakfasts there are tons of options for both. I however like both so I got the steak eggs Benedict with avocado and the macadamia banana nut pancakes. Both were good but the pancakes were phenomenal. I mean, so good. But like, straight up dessert haha we devoured it all and will be back.   Oh and the Oj is literally fresh squeezed which is why it's lol $5 a glass",

    "text": "Absolutely do not recommend. Let's start with the food: I ordered the traditional Eggs Benedict. Several things were wrong. One: it came out at room temperature. Two: They used ham instead of Canadian bacon. Three: The ham was overcooked and chewy. Four: The poached egg was overcooked. Five: The hollandaise sauce was lacking in taste and had solidified on the plate due to the temperature of the dish itself.  Atmosphere: this place is incredibly loud. Not just loud for a restaurant, loud for a rock 'n' roll concert. Do not recommend going here if you would like to have a conversation with the person sitting across the table from you.  Service: our waitress was kind,  but ineffective in dealing with the above-mentioned eggs Benedict issue. Neither was either the manager on duty, nor the general manager able to do anything other than ask me to come back and try them again...WHICH I WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE DOING!  With so many great breakfast place is available in the Scottsdale area, this is certainly one to be avoided.",

In all fairness, it was busy; however it's always busy on weekends and we have never had such a poor dining experience here. Hopefully with the volume this restaurant is producing, staff will be increased for efficiency and to promote more friendliness.",

This is probably one of the longest menus I've seen at a breakfast place, which usually overwhelms me. Just give me one page and limit my options! But seriously, a great selection and lots of lunch choices too. I ordered the sun-dried tomato, goat cheese and pine nut omelette. Delicious combo! I got hash browns and pancakes on the side, both great and the cakes are huge. Overall I really enjoyed this place and hope to come back.",

    "text": "Debating between a 3 and a 4 - lets call this 3.5 Stars :)   Eggstacy gets the bump because of their food - however the rest of the experience left something to be desired.   We went for the first time for Sunday brunch - around 11am and there was quite a wait for the larger groups. Luckily our table for 2 was ready in no time and my friend was seated by the time I finished parking and joined her. Then we sat for the next 10 minutes with no drinks or even waters and virtually ignored by all the staff busy bustling throughout. Now it was busy, no doubt about that, but I was really hoping for some water at least, it was a hot day!   When the waitress did arrive, we were ready to put in our drink orders and she did bring us some much needed water. However, about 5 minutes later the waitress came back and asked me if I ordered the Apple Cider drink - which doesn't exist on the menu - and I clarified how I wanted the Boozie Iced Coffee. Another 10 minutes and both of our drinks were ready and we were onto the ordering. She again confused my friend's order and had to clarify, which I did appreciate as the wait was long and getting the wrong order for a Vegetarian would delay things quite a bit. Overall the waitress seemed really overwhelmed and confused throughout the day, which is unfortunate.   Another thing - this place was full of families eating big meals together - but the music was some loud techno noise. I don't get it, the volume and the type of music did not go with the atmosphere or clientele at all. Very strange choice and was honestly distracting. This, paired with the waitress and waiting had us discussing how we'd likely not be back - unless the food was great.   Well, the food arrived and it was AWESOME.  My ham and cheesy crepes were incredible and a portion so huge - 3 giant crepes filled with scrambled eggs, ham, and creamy cheese. My friend got a truffle butter brioche toast with asparagus and added mushrooms - it looked as good as it tasted. So in the end, we loved our food and the drinks were good too - always nice to have booze as an option. I would go back, just maybe not during the Sunday brunch rush - perhaps a weekday meal would be a better overall experience.",

The only thing I will say is those crepes need a light hollandaise sauce. The pancakes were perfect. We also each had the fresh squeezed strawberry OJ. AMAZING.  Today: we went with something a little different. We tried the strawberry mimosas. Great!",

We sat at the bar and you'd have thought we were invisible. Nobody cleared the places next to us for 35 minutes and nobody said a word to us for 15 minutes until we finally flagged one of the many workers down. This is not an exaggeration, many people walked by us but nobody made eye contact, or said a word.  We've eaten at many many restaurants in Scottsdale and their service was by far the worst I've ever seen.  Save your time, money, and energy and go someplace else. Obviously they are poorly managed and have no idea how to handle a crowd (and again, not that crowded based on the open tables that they couldn't fill). If customers are important in the restaurant business and you don't pay any attention to your customers, you deserve to fail.  I'd have given them a zero but the lowest I could give them was a one. An extreme disappointment!",

Like at any breakfast place, anywhere, I expected the 30 minute wait to get a table on a weekend morning (especially a Sunday). But what I didn't expect was to wait another 30 minutes for my food to come after I ordered it. One of the best parts about going out for breakfast is how quickly it can be cooked up. It was obvious the kitchen was in the weeds. We could easily see all the runners and servers standing around waiting for orders. And an apologetic waiter could only do so much.",

But, if you went for pancakes, you'd lose your buzz and maybe your random hookup? No one should have to choose between getting drunk, being seen/getting laid, and pancakes. Thank the sweet baby Jesus for Eggstasy.   Housed in an innocuous appearing strip mall in Scottsdale, Eggstasy is truly like having breakfast in a nightclub. The \"hostesses\", who clearly look to the Kardashian family for fashion guidance, look at my handbag when I come in, not me. The space is pure Ikea, sparsely decorated, cheap and cheesy. While walking to your table, everybody is checking everybody else out hard and not trying to hide it. It is a goddamn fashion show -- stupid, but entertaining.  The coffee totally sucks and is barely edible -- super burnt and bitter. The servers are nice but overwhelmed; orders go in and come out wrong; empty cups go unfilled of shitty coffee. Twice in row, they've given us food that was ordered by mistake, saying \"oh, just have it, don't worry about it\". It is noisy; it isn't cheap. It is crowded; be prepared to wait.  So why the hell four stars, you're asking. One: The OJ is juiced on site and is incredible. Two: the whole wheat and berry pancakes, from the HEALTHY part of the menu, are literally the best fucking pancakes I've ever had. It must be the whole wheat, it gives them a little more heft and texture and allows them to get all perfectly crispy around the edges. Then they pile on mountains of fresh berries. I mean, really -- I am powerless. Three: It is way too much fun to play \"let's traumatize the Scottsdalites\" by showing up in pajamas and no makeup just to see the looks on their buffed and powdered faces. Four: the owners, a Greek family from Chicago, are always there, checking in and getting their hands dirty to help out. I love that. Plus, Greeks from Chicago? They make the world's most amazing food.  Lastly, the Bloody Marys look amazing. Is that chocolate covered bacon in there? If I hadn't already resigned myself to be so uncool as to admit to disliking day drinking, I would be all over that.",

    "text": "The husband and I joined about 15 other Yelpers here for the breakfast club UYE. This place graciously accommodated our large party, which was much appreciated. Our waitress was incredible, she was friendly, on top of things, and willing to help me navigate their huge menu. I don't think there are many breakfast items that aren't on their menu... this thing is huge, with pages and pages of items. The waitress had to help me decide between 4 items (ha!). I ended up getting the asparagus skillet (asparagus, bacon, garlic, cheese, quinoa, hash browns, and over medium eggs, about 12$ ish), which (to my surprise) comes with a 'side' of pancakes... and I had to try a specialty pancake (the macadamia nut) which was a 4$ up sell. The husband got the nutella crepes. I will be honest, I wasn't overly thrilled with the food. My 'skillet' came out in a bowl.. a little odd for a skillet, and just didn't have as much flavor as you would think from the ingredients. It wasn't bad by any means, it was good, but kind of boring. Maybe some fresh herbs or something would make it pop more. The side of pancakes was ridiculously large... I ate less than a quarter of them... and they really were nothing special. I have a little bit of a problem with restaurants that serve huge portions like this.... I feel like it's just wasteful.... very few people could possibly eat this amount of food, making so much food go to waste (bigger is not always better people). Why not give size options for the breakfast like 'small' and 'large' plates of the same food... then you can choose what you would like (and I know, you can share the food, but you don't always want the same thing, ya know?). Anyway, on the flip side, the husband's nutella crepes were delicious and even good as leftovers. The coffee was also good here and came with real cream... yes, you heard me... real cream... LOVE that. I would like to come back here and try something else, as many other items looked tasty. Will update the review at that time.   PS yes this place is loud, but not as loud as I thought it would be.... pretty normal for a restaurant this busy.",

    "text": "I was surprised, considering the reviews are mixed. For me I got the veggie omelette, with fruit and the gluten-free pancakes. I'm strangely picky about my veggie omelette. It bothers me when it comes out with little tiny pieces of veggies, unlike this one. Big pieces of veggies and a big omelette. Fruit was a skewer of mainly pineapple, but it was good. Gluten-free pancakes, still hard to find, were very good and they gave you two of them. Service was friendly and very quick. The room is also big, open with a very large outside patio. The only negative is it's a bit confusing to get in to the plaza (at the end of it). That doesn't seem like a big deal for what I think is a five star breakfast. PS, I did go at an off time, which was 10:30 on Monday so maybe that's why things went smoothly.",

    "text": "My friend invited me to try this restaurant with her since it got such great Yelp reviews. Let's just say it didn't go \"over easy.\" Sadly, my visit wasn't as I expected it to be. Don't get me wrong it wasn't a bad experience but it wasn't great either. For all the hype I heard it was a huge let down.  The interior of the restaurant is designed very well and the overall setting is comfortable. The staff was friendly and the service was fine.   Let me start by saying breakfast is one of my favorite meals. I ordered the breakfast panini with fruit on the side. The food was ready within a average amount of time. The sandwich itself was the most depressing part. My eyes gleamed with excitement as they placed it in front of me. I took a bite and confusion immediately set in. The meal looked so wonderful but the taste told me otherwise. Was this a wolf in sheep's clothing deceiving me? The only way I can describe it was that it just tasted bland, it was missing every flavor it listed on the menu. Specifically the eggs, they just didn't taste like eggs should and I'm sorry my poor vocabulary knowledge can't give your imagination a clear picture of how it was. It included avocado, peppers, onions, and bacon I believe. I'm not sure why, maybe because they cooked it with the other ingredients and it affected the taste? I found myself dousing it in Cholula sauce to help give it some flavor. The bread was perfectly crisp and was the only satisfying crunch. The side fruit came out on a skewer and I only had like 6 half pieces of fruit which was disappointing. The sandwich just wasn't that great, I only ate half and I'm a non-picky starving 23 year old. My friends pancakes looked tasty but I didn't try them. I'm sure something else on the menu would be better. It was my first time there, but I would only return if someone else suggested it.",

They are snotty and rude and dressed in clothing that would scarcely be appropriate in the home environment. You then wait agonizingly long on what is supposed to be contemporary furnishing. For the amount of time you sit there though it is uncomfortable while you watch the what appear to be incredibly stupid hostess adjust the waistband of her tights for 20 minutes but never seat one freaken person. Finally I get up to survey what the deal is and note no less than five open tables clean and ready to seat. When an inquiry is made we are amazingly next to be seated. They bring us to a table the seats are dirty the floor around it is covered with trash. You have to move the cheap ass furniture to even sit down. We had to share our menus with the table next to us who ended up seating themselves because they were like what the heck. There were not enough clean glasses for them to have one each they shared a water glass. This place is at best a bad joke. Bad experience overall.",

    "text": "I was pretty excited to try Eggstasy based on the reviews.  I ordered the omelette with prosciutto, Swiss chard, mascarpone and one other ingredient. Boyfriend ordered the Dutch apple french toast. We also ordered Bloody Mary's, his was spicy and I ordered mine regular. We also ordered coffee.  The good: quick seating despite how busy it was. The waiter was prompt. The presentation of the drinks was fun-- it came with chocolate covered bacon. Portions were humongous so the \"good\" is that at first you feel you're getting bang for your buck. There was almost no room left on the table to set all the food and drinks. The coffee was satisfactory-- a little stronger/not watered down.  The not-so-good: My omelette was pretty dry. The ingredients were there, but the mascarpone didn't really shine at all.   The Dutch apple french toast was just overwhelmingly monstrous. Once you got to the center the intense sweetness calmed down a little, but still really, really heavy.   The bloody mary was not good. The chocolate on the bacon was overwhelming after a bite. The mix itself was mediocre, and the vodka in it didn't taste all that smooth. It was also $10! I would rather get a $5 bloody mary deal at a sports bar for the taste quality alone!   The drinks also came to our table spilling over, which I think if I were the business owner I would be concerned about the waste. As a customer, I just didn't like that it soaked the whole napkin coaster. Thanks for filling it to the brim, but I don't want the mess.  Disappointed and would probably have to read more reviews on what people liked, to decide whether it's worth returning to try those things.",

    "text": "I was very excited to try this place after seeing the reviews on here.  We waited for about 30 minutes for our table, which isn't too bad in general, but upon being seated I figured out what the break in the chain is: the kitchen.    Our waiter, Luke, was competent and friendly.  As we waited for food, I couldn't help but notice large gatherings of servers standing at the food \"window\" waiting for the seemingly missing dishes from their orders.  Plates would appear one at a time, which was odd since the average table size was 4+.  It became obvious that food tickets weren't being completed a ticket at a time, instead, they were batching meals.    Our appetizer, chocolate covered bacon, came out just before our meals started to be delivered...which took about 20 minutes after ordering.  One side of pancakes (regular) were delivered.  Then, a few minutes later, the second and third side of pancakes (pumpkin cheesecake).  Then, yet another few minutes later, the french toast entree arrived.  It took almost 10 minutes for the omelets to come out.  One side of pancakes never came out, so we got them to go.    The food was very good!  The kitchen manager was seen speaking very \"animated\" to the waiters and line cooks, which was unprofessional and, from what I could tell, he was the weak link (in the white shirt on the left facing away in the picture).  Ticket times were all over the place, and orders were not being delivered all-at-once.   The restaurant has been around for 5 weeks, so they should be over growing pains like this.  We will be back for the food, though.  For those complaining about the noise: I feel you.  No carpet, no cushions, all hard surfaces!    They take reservations, which is good!",

    "text": "Sure feels like I've been getting to know the area around Scottsdale Road & Shea Boulevard pretty well of late.  D'Lite, Butterfield's, Hop Doddy, and Zak's Chocolate are a few of my more recent discoveries in this neighborhood.  Now you can add Eggstasy, a breakfast concept spot I'd bookmarked a few months ago.  Empty fridge on a Sunday before the groceries stores were open meant I was in search of a good breakfast to start the day.  Thankfully Eggstasy opens its doors at 6:30am daily.  Let's eat.  You'll find Eggstacy in the Agua Caliente center on the north side of 69th Street & Shea.  Enter through the archway, then turn right into the shopping center where you'll find Eggstacy set near the southeast corner.  I came right at opening on Sunday and grabbed a table next to the kitchen.  Chicago transplant Peter Verros is the man behind this large open air breakfast and lunch spot, which he originally opened in Chicago before deciding to pack up shop and instead move his operation to Scottsdale.  His Scottsdale restaurant can seat at least 200 or more at a time including the patio.  But even the interior restaurant is open to the elements as the bar area is setup in a wide open indoor/outdoor fashion.  The morning was perfect outside so no worries today, though I do wonder how they mitigate the summer heat.  Anyways, onto the food.  The menu is quite vast and contains most of your breakfast standards.  Egg dishes (obviously), pancakes, french toast dishes, skillets, waffles, benedicts, and even some crepes.  And this being Scottsdale you'll also find a large array of healthier as well as some gourmet breakfast items from something called a skinny B***h to a wild smoked salmon dish.  The dish I wanted was the first one listed on the menu.  The Eggasm is listed as an appetizer but for $9 I fully expected something pretty filling.  The description read like a sandwich but I couldn't find any Yelp photos to confirm that so I ordered this in the blind.  I also ordered perhaps their most unique side offering, their chorizo cheddar grits.  Add some fresh squeezed OJ to wash it down and I was ready to go.  The Eggasm was nothing like I pictured.  Instead of a sandwich, it came as a plate full of toasted ciabatta bread topped with specs of prosciutto, chives, and shaved parmesan cheese.  Then at the other end of the plate was a jar full of coddled eggs and potato puree, in a form soft enough to act as a spread for the ciabatta bread.  Basically just grab small spoonfuls of the egg/potato jar mix and throw it on the ciabatta and munch away.  While not what I was expecting, it was truly delicious.  The prosciutto and parmesan cheese helped elevate the flavor profile beautifully while the bread gave it the crunchy texture.  A very pleasant surprise dish I never saw coming.  The grits were also tasty, albeit a little heavy and the portion size of the side is probably meant to be shared by two.  I mixed in a little of the grits with the Eggasm at times and the two dishes really work well together.  My only big disappointment was the OJ honestly.  Fresh squeezed is fine and a little pulp is okay by me, but honestly Eggstasy's OJ was chalked full of pulp.  For others, this may not be hangup.  But for me I don't want pulp unless I'm just eating an orange straight.  When it comes to juice, I'd greatly appreciate some of that pulp strained out.  Total cost for the food, OJ, tax and tip came to about $25.  Service was friendly and prompt (I was one of the few early risers on Sunday so I suppose that was a given), and the food items I chose were a nice twist on the usual breakfast fare.  The restaurant itself is an ideal space for breakfast and lunch during the cooler months in the valley and the bar area in particular provides some great people watching vantage points.  As I write this they'll soon be opening a second location just east of here on Shea & Via Linda.  I came for Eggstasy and ended up having an Eggasm.  The puns here quite literally write themselves.",

And to add insult to injury the server constantly asking \"was everything perfect?\"  No. It was far from perfect. Not once did a manager approach us to apologize. We finally received our toast orders once everyone was finished with their meals and then the server place another parties dirty plates in front of me spilling someone's leftovers right in front of me. Nothing was adjusted on our check and again- not one apology. This is so completely unacceptable that I wish there were more places I could post to tell people to avoid that place.

    "text": "Before today, this was my all time favorite breakfast spot. However, after seeing some of the unsanitary food handling methods, I am not sure I can ever go back.  We were seated near the kitchen and observed a male and female worker handling the plates and doing the final prep of the food before it was delivered to customers. Neither were wearing gloves. They were consistently using bare hands to add seasonings, toppings, sides, to the dishes. Both were seen touching their face and hair and then using their hands to manage the food. That lovely piece of mint in your yogurt? Handled by bare hands after wiping her brow. The fruit kabob? Put on the plate by bare hands after wiping hair.  We called over the manager and pointed out this poor practice. She walked away from us, went to the kitchen, whispered something to the male food handler, who then instructed the female food handler to put on gloves. She made a face and did put on the gloves. Five minutes later they were off and she was once again adding food items to plates using her hands to gather seasonings and sprinkle on omelettes. The manager even observed this and said nothing. So, they either don't care or don't know that this is a health violation. It kind of makes me wonder what goes on in the areas I can't see?  I have reported the violation to Maricopa County Health Dept. Funny, as I was filling out the online complaint form, I notice this same restaurant has had the exact same complaint once before. Glad to know they believe in process improvement. NOT.  So, for all of you who have written fabulous reviews about how great the food is...just know that the secret ingredient is sweat, hair, and whatever else was on the bare hands.",

In the warmer months, you're gonna burn sitting out there. My biggest gripe about this place is the music volume. Way. Too. Loud. Its nearly impossible to carry on a conversation with someone across one of the larger round tables they have in the corner.",

She was nice, but has not been trained properly as a sever. A water jug was brought but no water glasses given. No silverware was brought. She took forever to come by each time. She was not a helpful server with great menu tips or explanations on food. We didn't ask for many explanations because when we did she didn't really know or didn't seem to care to explain much. The food was horrendous and when I mentioned that BOTH the items I ordered were bad, only one was taken off. If I were serving a table with unsatisfactory items, I would have been beside myself trying to appease my customer. I was a waitress for 8 years. I would have brought in a manager to talk to my table and fixed everything that needed fixing on the bill. To our waitress, who seemed nice, we felt like an afterthought. We were also charged full price for a virgin Bloody Mary. The coffee was ice cold. We will not be back.",

I judge a Bfast experience on the coffee since it's the first thing I taste and it's pretty hard to screw up an omelet. So A+ on that. The menu is quite extensive but I settled on the Greek omelet. It was very good. Along with my order came a skewer of fresh fruit and either pancakes or toast. I chose the toast. The serving size is almost too much. You get a lot of food here. The ambiance is \" chill\" however, they were quite busy for a Thursday @ 10:30. The staff is very friendly and likeable. This place deserves a very positive review.",

My husband didn't get his toast. And another is still waiting for syrup for their pancakes.  Finally my crepes arrive.  I wish I could say they were worth the wait.  But sadly, they were not.  They had the metallic taste of the pan and then I'd get the taste of onion, which would have been fine but I ordered the mango papaya crepes.  I don't want to taste onion.  I suggest having separate crepe pans for sweet vs. savory crepes. There was only one place setting when we got to the table too, so when the food for the first 2 arrived, they couldn't even eat if they want to or even spread butter on the toast.  And it seemed like every time we asked for something, it took forever to get it.  We also asked at the beginning for our check to be split and our server said he'd take care of it at the end.  Then he brings us one check, so we had to remind him tht we wanted it split.  So he stood at the table and marked off what we each got, and then says, \" just give me your cards right now.\"  Seems rather unprofessional to me.  Overall, not very impressed and we probably won't be back.",

The interior was pretty hip and cool, definitely fun to look at ha. The service was also good. Overall I was somewhat disappointed though. I was excited when seeing the variety of vegetarian friendly omelettes! It always sucks to go to a breakfast place where only one omelette is just veggies and the rest are meat. I went for the swiss chard, caramelized onion, and gruyere omelette with a side of pancakes and fruit (no pineapple because I'm slightly allergic). The omelette looked unappealing when they brought it out, but I didn't judge it based on looks. I don't know if the cheese was just too sweet for an omelette and I didn't like that or what, but it left me with a stomach ache lasting the whole day. The pancakes were kind of favorless, not as soft and fluffy as I prefer my pancakes. They also brought me fruit out with pineapple, which i requested no pineapple, when I told the server she was apologetic and happy to fix it. She handed it to her coworker to fix and he said \"Can't I just take it off?\" and she said no, which I am glad about. They brought me a nice bowl of fresh fruit, but it was more than my friend had on his skewer! It was a little pricey as well. Expected though, as it is a nicer breakfast place in Scottsdale! Overall, not very tempted to come back, mostly because of the stomach ache. There might be something much better on the menu though that I did not get so I have not completely written this place off yet.",

But the quality in consumer service has drastically changed and it got so bad, I've had to walk out. Just right now, one of the girls that work at entrance had quite an attitude, threw the menu onto the table and just walked away. We then waited for a while to get water, and keep in mind that it wasn't busy to get someone to come to our table. I got so agitated with not getting any service, been sat at a table with dirty cups and the bill from the last customers that sat there, that we walked away.

Because we came in on a Monday morning, the restaurant was not super busy.   I ordered the basic eggs Benedict and my husband had the corned beef hash. The Benedict and hash browns were just okay. Nothing special with the flavor. My husband liked the way the corned beef hash was prepared (not undercooked and with a little crispness).    We also ordered a mimosa and Bloody Mary drinks. The first Bloody Mary drink needed to be redone. There was not enough spice or tomato flavor. The Bloody Mary comes with a chocolate covered piece of bacon. That was okay (maybe too much chocolate coating).  There are a lot of choices on the menu and because this place is new, I believe they are still finding their signature flavor. I'd be willing to give it another try.",

My husband and I lived right by here and made this our breakfast spot, and there are quiet a few just around Scottsdale and Shea.  The food was good, portions huge.  A little pricey but its Scottsdale.  Well a few months ago a server shook some hot sauce and got it EVERYWHERE!  In my hair, on my shirt, my husbands shirt across from me, all over the people next to us.  What a disaster!  They said they would pay to dry clean anything and we didn't care too much about our t- shirts we had one but I did care about my fabric Micheal Kors purse.  I followed up a bit after and they still agreed, cool.  Life was busy but I searched dry cleaners and no one did purses, i was surprised.  the manager said she would look and she fell off the planet.  I even emailed her to see if she had luck, crickets.  I am pretty upset that purse is now ruined and cost way more than the breakfast itself (which they didn't offer to cover just a gift card to come back-nice but our meals were ruined then not later).  I have guests coming in this week and taking them elsewhere this time, pretty bummed-not just bc of purse but the lack of follow up and not going back for the fun food.",

    "text": "Food was delicious with generous portions. My friends and I knew that this place would probably be busy on a Sunday morning so we came early and got a table out on the patio. Everything we ordered came out promptly even though there was a large crowd, and we all loved our entrees.   The only reason why I didn't rate this place higher was because of the service. After being seated and our drink orders taken, our waitress did not show up to our table to take our order for almost half an hour. Additionally, when our food was brought out the servers forgot my friend's pancakes and toast. We were also the only table in our section without a water pitcher on our table and my friend had to ask our waitress three times for water until she finally got someone to bring us a pitcher. While we were eating our meal, a server came to our table with a dish that we did not order. I don't necessarily blame our waitress per se because I also work in a restaurant and understand that things get busy sometimes, I believe that this was due to poor and uncoordinated teamwork/communication with the cooks, servers, busboys, and waitress.        In the end, my friends and I agreed that we would come back and give it another try! We've already kind of decided on what we would like to try next time.",

Which I promptly took home with half my omelet! Server was nice and attentive and coffee is da bomb (very good brand, name escapes me). Place is loud so be prepared.

Do a \"bene with a half order side\" (that way you still get the side with $2 off same as with the eggs/omelettes).  We added avocado to ours, truly amazing! The pancakes don't even need anything extra- they're amazingly better or equal to the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes which have always been our fav.  Thank you #EGGstasy you're our fav breakfast place in town and we love you so much!  The chefs are so friendly and they're passionate about their food- coming back to try the Dutch apple brioche French toast and protein pancakes made from natural protein starches- NOT a protein powder.

I typically don't comment on servers/bartenders looks because that invites all sorts of attention, but DAMN the bartenders here were some good lookin' boys.   Anyway. I'm engaged. Ahem.  My best friend lives a couple blocks away so we walked over on Sunday morning. It looked like there would have been a lengthy wait, but they had 2 seats open at the bar outside, which was perfect. We made friends with the salty old gent to my right and proceeded to peruse the menu, which had MANY options. I was almost overwhelmed.  We ordered:  - Chocolate covered bacon: Do it. Don't ask questions. Thank me later. (You're welcome.) - Joe P's Protein Cakes: Gluten free! Berries! FOUR OF THEM! (Too much, if you ask me.) They were very thick, so if I had known there were 4 of them I might have ordered something smaller. - Chicks in Blankets: Chicken sausage inside pancakes. Yum! - Coffee: my first cup wasn't that hot but the second one was, and both were delicious. - Grapefruit mimosas: Just the right amount of bitter and sweet. I could have had a few of those without thinking twice.  A great thing about the bar: there are hooks underneath! I always loath having to hold my purse or put it on the bar, so this was welcome.  My ONLY complaint is that it was sometimes difficult to get the attention of the servers/bartenders. But they were nice to look at so it really wasn't an issue.  TL;DR: Decently priced, delicious food and drinks, but sometimes the wait might be long.",

First thing I always get is their Strawberry Orange Juice it is delicious and it is a must if you haven't had it, get it. This place is always busy especially on weekends but it is worth the wait they have a great outside patio where you can take in some rays and eat your breakfast too.  Their Crepes are great and so are their pancakes if you haven't had them before bring some buddies and an appetite to make sure you taste a little bit of everything. My favorite part is that they offer great choices on the menu as far as omelets but if you want to do your own thing they let you do that too.  Perfect breakfast spot for the whole family moderately priced.",

As far as service, I've had everything from the waiter crying and throwing the credit card holder to amazing attentive service. They are definitely not organized but the food makes up for it! I've loved everything I've tried so far, crepes are my favorite!   On several occasions we have had Erin as our waiter and he is very good. If you're lucky enough to get him, you're in good hands! Very attentive in a sincere type of way.   I would love for this place to have a better dress code for the women, they tend to wear club-wear and it's just not appropriate for a breakfast place. Also one of the managers or owners mom wears her nightgown there and it's a bit odd!  I recommend maybe a shirt with your name or logo and some jeans! Simple",

Today we walked in there was a 30 minute wait but we walked up to the bar and got full service right away. Lona took care of us today and I must say, she was pretty awesome! We ordered, coffee, water and a Bloody Mary to start. Let's say she knows how to pour a good Bloody Mary! And of course it's topped with chocolate covered bacon, you can't go wrong with that!   Lona was on it and took our order right away, made suggestions and talked me into the cinnamon swirl pancakes (not on the menu). I loooove cinnamon rolls so this was an easy sell for me. I ordered the gypsy steak skillet again. Lots of protein and added the cinnamon swirl pancakes to share with my friend.   My friend ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. She isn't a big breakfast person (I had to convince her to come with the enticing Bloody Mary!) The buffalo chicken in the wrap had a maple syrup flavor. Which seems appropriate for a breakfast/brunch spot, but it didn't taste so great in combo with the buffalo sauce. We let Lona know and she was super friendly and took care of it, no problem!   The atmosphere is super friendly and upbeat. And I enjoyed watching all the dishes come out. Sitting at the bar added to the fun as we got to talk to fellow breakfast lovers :) they have a bar that is both indoors and outdoors.   Only downfalls, in the past we have waited forever on a Sunday after church. And the patio after about 11:00 the sun is BEATING down on you. No shade if you aren't under the cover. They definitely need some umbrellas or a shade cover if they plan to use the patio more.   Other than that. I love this place!! :) enjoy!",

    "text": "I know when a new place opens up it's easy to get all caught up in the hype and newness of it.  Looking at all these other 5 star reviews leaves me to believe that it's the hype more than anything that is blowing people away.    I went here yesterday morning and found out that yesterday was their actual grand opening and that the week prior was their soft opening.  That left me wondering if all of these 5 star ratings were just to get the word out about this place. Our server Dan was a really nice guy. He kind of looks like a bootleg version of Ryan Gosling in The Notebook when he had the beard. Yeah, I've seen The Notebook. What guy with a girlfriend hasn't? Anyways bootleg Gosling really took the time to get to know us.  The cucumber infused water was pretty good. And they do have some of the best orange juice I have probably ever tasted.  The chocolate covered bacon i had was pretty good. But maybe had too much chocolate on it. I was hoping for a salty sweet taste with the chocolate covered bacon and I mostly tasted chocolate and not much bacon til the last bite.   I will agree with some of the other reviews that their attire was all over the place. But that's not really a big deal. It seems like places that only cater to breakfast and brunch the staff wears pretty much whatever they like.   The main issue I had with the place was what I ordered. I drove all the way out there for Red Velvet French Toast. And what I got was Red Velvet cake with some kind of brulee it looked like put on top. It was ok. But considering the distance I drove. I was very disappointed that it was just cake. My girlfriend ordered the stuff french toast binoche. And instead got the Nutella banana french toast and hashbrowns. But she didn't notice until half way eating it cause it was so massive she didn't know that it wasn't stuffed. She really enjoyed the food that she ordered The portions they give you are very good portions.  Eggstasy has the look of being a hipster place for sure. The decor is cool even though the bathrooms don't have his/her signs on the doors. They still got some kinks to work out. But all in all it wasn't bad and I would recommend them and give them another try. Next time I'll try their sister restaurant attach to them called Sausage N Crack! Ok....I might have made up that one.",

We sat at the bar where there was only one bar tender - apparently the other left sick - and for the most part the service was very accommodating. I got an omlette that was massive, and they give you the choice between toast or pancakes. The sourdough toast I ordered was paired with fresh whipped butter and an individual sized jar of jam. If you order pancakes as your side, be prepared for a full, two-cake plate with whipped cream.    The wait was not bad at all at first - maybe 15, 20 minutes. The more we have visited, the worse the wait times have become. Expect to wait 40 minutes for your food to arrive, and then watch the waiters ask every table on the way if the order is theres or not. The staff is so poorly trained and managed that its almost comical. The only other downside is a question of the general cleanliness of the restaurant and an odd restroom set up. The bang-for-your-buck factor, along with the quality of food, is great. Just not sure of its worth the circus that ensues.",

It appears that we just beat the morning rush on a Sunday morning because 20 minutes after we arrived it got noticeably busy.  We waiting 5 minutes to sit outside in the patio area.  Love the patio layout and the colors.  They have a large patio that can accommodate large groups.  They also have a pretty extensive menu,  If you're in the mood for good breakfast this is the spot.  I order the stuffed brioche french toast and the prosciutto eggs Benedict with a side of maple sausage. The french toast can feed 2 people easily.  4 big slices of bread stuffed brioche style.  The prosciutto eggs Benedict would've been better if the prosciutto wasn't so salty.  It was very over powering while eating.  I would defeinitly come back here to try more of the menu.  It's hit or miss if you show up any time before 9am.",

To start, the staff was very welcoming and friendly. We were sat right away. The coffee was strong just the way I like it and cucumber water...refreshing! We were randomly and happily served the banana macadamia pancakes on the house. Not overly sweet and very hearty.   I ordered the prosciutto benedict and my boyfriend ordered the avocado benedict. So we did a lil swap and had one of each. I fell in love with both but the prosciutto really stole my heart! The hashbrowns were crispy just the way I like em!   Then some man with authority, perhaps the manager or owner, stopped by our table a couple times checking in on us, realizing we were newbies. He was very nice and accommodating.   Basically, I can't wait to go back!!",

    "text": "Yelp Breakfast Club UYE here this morning (thanks for setting this up Monica). I had the Belgian waffle ($7.95) which came with a skewer of fresh fruit. The waffle was warm, not hot, and was crispy on the outside, but slightly spongy instead of fluffy on the inside. I could barely get the butter to melt. The syrup was warm and there was a smear of whipped cream on the side of the waffle. I also had a cup of hot chocolate ($2.95). It was a small cup with whipped cream and chocolate syrup on top. It was average in taste.  The noise level was a real problem. The physical setting is one huge room (like a high school cafeteria) and carrying on a conversation was problematic. The wait staff was friendly and waited until we were ready to take our table of 17's orders--however, the food came out at two separate times, even though the orders were taken at the same time. I felt bad eating before everyone had their food, but waffles and eggs get cold quickly and are only edible warm. Parking is tight for this small shopping center.  Overall, slightly better than the average breakfast place.",

It wasn't actual red velvet though; it was just the regular pancake with red dye.

Our bill was 43 dollars for breakfast! Apparently they won't tell you that the pancakes are extra even though they say \"it comes with it\". Her exact words were \"and would you like GF, protein or regular pancakes with your omelette\"? As if it just comes with the omelette. This is incredibly shady and is a poor tactic by the restaurant considering it adds 3-4 dollars per meal to the bill. When we received the bill I explained the confusion to the waitress and she giggled and said \"sorry\". Giggled. I'm not making this up. No matter how good breakfast can be, 52 dollars (after tip) for eggs and pancakes and a coffee is just insane. Out of principle I hope people who read this do not go here.",

They accidentally put cheese on it though and I'm pretty sure they just scraped it off. But all of the veggies (aka the part I care about) was with the cheese and also scraped off. And to make up for it they put more hashbrowns on it. Which is fine but I had ordered a hashbrown side to replace the eggs it came with. So its soo much hash browns at this point. Also they gave us a used can of jelly. Which they fixed but still it was wild. I think that they should learn how to work with a full restaurant better and get better vegan food because a lot of people in this area would enjoy it.",

They have chocolate covered bacon need I say more? I have to order it  next time just for fun. This is a cute and super busy place on the weekends. By far one of the most creative breakfast menus in Scottsdale!   The serving sizes are huge! The price point is amazing and you will definitely take food home. I love the fresh squeezed orange juice and assortment of creative crepes, pancakes, skillets, bennies, omelettes and french toast. The menu is large with extensive offerings. There is literally something for everyone.   I have been here 2 days in a row. My favorite is the apple sausage, hash browns and the epic pancakes, most of which are gluten free but not all of them are gf. I do not believe they have gf toast which would be a great add especially because they have an amazing looking avocado toast.   They also have some very healthy breakfast and lunch options as well for those on a strict diet. Seriously though this place is worth ditching the  diet and just diving into some of that food decadence!  Everyone here is super nice and helpful and I found the service and staff to be on par. I can't wait to come back and do lunch,  but this place is now in my favorite breakfast rotation!",

Disappointing when it's July in AZ and people are looking to escape the heat.   Ordered the Brioche French Toast, came out way undercooked. Very rarely do I send items back, but this was not edible. Not to mention the fear of consuming raw eggs when you're pregnant isn't very comforting...  They offered to remake it and I kindly declined but they did it anyway and it arrived when my family was done with their meals.   Having been in the food and bev business for years, it's common courtesy to remove an item from a customers check when they are clearly unhappy with it. Not the case here. Guess they need the money more than returning customers.",

The service was slow! It took 15 minutes after being seated to get water and an hour to get our food.   The glowing recommendations may be from people who do not go on the weekend.

The food is actually decent BUT the service is quite terrible. We were a large party, but frankly they did not know how to keep our orders organized. The waiter had no idea what he was doing, the manager could care less that the service was so bad and actually yelled at us, then the last straw was the obnoxious owner who claimed that the staff did nothing wrong!   I'm sorry but I do not think it should take an hour to get a beverage! We were also sitting in the hot sun during midday and had to beg for water!  They never once apologized for the terrible service. They made one lame attempt to give my friend a $20 gift card (this brunch was her birthday celebration with friends & family) but when she tried to use it, they refused to take it! Then the owner violently ripped the gift card right out of my friend's hands!!! The waiter also acted inappropriately many times and got very angry, and then towards the end he actually took one of those leather binders that the checks come in and threw it against the wall as he stormed off!!  The whole thing was soooo unbelievable.  As I've been telling the story, more people have shared with me that they also had very bad experiences with the service! If you have no desire to actually provide customer service and make sure that people can enjoy their food in a comfortable, friendly environment - then GET OUT OF THE HOSPITALITY BUSINESS!  Ok, venting done. Had to get that out and WARN people!  Thanks for listening!",

The food was amazing everything was so full of flavor and presentation (not that this matters too much) was beautiful too! 3 out of the 4 of us at the table had eggs Benedict. I switched out the ham for bacon on mine...still delicious (better in my opinion :p). I also ordered a side of the homemade corn beef hash and everyone at the table agreed that was good too! No one had any complaints about their meals. Every order that we saw come out of the kitchen looked drool-worthy. I'm pretty sure everything you order here is good, at least it all looks delicious!  Our waitress was fast, efficient, and helpful! She even offered a solution for us with sides we ordered to get it at a cheaper rate! Good looking out and much appreciated!  The place is hip and for a younger crowd maybe...music was pretty loud making everyone have to yell a little to speak to each other. No inside voices here! I loved it! It was new up to date music and put me in a great mood to start the day.",

After we finally got seated it was at least an hour before they brought 1 item of food out.  5 min later another single order came out wrong.  Basically staggered food for a table of 4.  Terrible!

This time however, it wasn't anything special. The waffle batter was sour and there were salt flakes on top of the caramel and cream; something I feel I would've remembered from the first time.   I let the the taste of the food slide, but the service is something I can't get over. Our check was dropped off about 10 minutes after we received our food. Our waitress went around to every table but ours, to ask how things were. I don't want to play the \"I'm brown in Scottsdale\" card, but the way my sister and I were waited on this afternoon was unacceptable. Again, I would've mentioned this to the waitress.. If she ever came around for longer than 30 seconds. Thanks for your service, Erin.",

The menu still can be overwhelming, so many choices to choose from, before I got there I was thinking nope not doing an omelet, those things are huge, but after checking out the menu I went ahead and ordered me one haha.  I ordered the Dali's Omelet, it had chorizo, jalapenos, onion and queso, this omelet was the best omelet I have had in a very long time, and it was flavorful, spicy and cooked perfectly!  So dang good!   I also ordered a side of one raspberry white chocolate pancake that is what I originally was headed there to try. It was a fluffy pancake drizzled with white chocolate and topped with raspberries, but it had a brulee sugar coating on top of the pancake, oh my this was pure sweet bliss!     Another great breakfast down at Eggstacy!",

The ambience is good, the menu is extensive, however the food was lackluster with style over substance.   We ordered the gyros hash with poached eggs, fruit and pancakes. The eggs were swimming in water and were barely cooked. I'm not sure what made the hash 'gyros', they were just potatoes with red onion and some random bits of meat thrown in. They were also massively under seasoned. The pancakes were weird and dry and the maple syrup was more like maple flavored syrup. Not sure if they use the real deal, but I've had better elsewhere. The one redeeming feature was the fruit skewer which isn't exactly hard to get wrong.   My husband ordered the pork belly Benedict, and I have no idea how you can mess up pork belly which is delicious however you have it, but it was tasteless and boring. The table next to us ordered their food then left half of it behind so I'm guessing they felt the same way. The coffee was good, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, along with the service and nice decor. There are so many delicious breakfast options in this area, there's no way we will be returning here.",

I saw this restaurant on my way to hike, I actually so a few other breakfast restaurant within a half miles radius. I chose to stop by here for its name after three hours of hiking.  When I walked in, I stepped back a little as it was nothing what I expected. I thought I came to have breakfast but inside it looks like as if you are in an island somewhere in Caribbean. The use of orange, light green and yellow color as well as a huge open bar area made me think I just stepped inside a bar or restaurant in tropical island.   When we arrived around noon, the wait we were told was 20-30 mins but they were able to seat us in 10 mins.  Server greeted us right away with cucumber water, just what I needed to quench slightly dehydrate body after a long hike.  I liked the freshly squeezed juice selection. Not just orange juice, but grapefruit, strawberry with pomegranate...   Full order of pancakes comes with four large fluffy packages. The server suggested to split to two plates for us. I had no ideas how big the pancakes plate was going to be. I am glad she explained otherwise I would have been taking leftover home and it doesn't taste as good.  Pancakes were very fluffy and generous portion of fresh fruits complimented the dish very nicely.  Flat bread salmon plate was also big but tasted so good. They proudly serve Lavazza coffee (my second favorite Italian coffee) and they kept coming back to refill my cup. I don't think my cup went down more than a half as a coffee person and our server kept coming back for more coffee.  They take reservations for a group of 8 or more. Their food and service was so good, I wanted to make reservation for Mother's Day. They suggested I call ahead to leave my name when I am ready to leave my house as they expect wait is going to be close to one hour on Mother's Day during peak hour.   They were busy but I never felt being rushed. We enjoyed leisurely breakfast on weekend and had a very relaxing time with great food and service. Can't wait to come back again.",

    "text": "Bacon smothered in chocolate does not typically pair with a Bloody Mary but the fact that Eggstasy just \"goes for it\" is an admirable feat. Sweet and salty mixed goodness is a True and tried recipe that seldom fails. Even without the Bloody Mary, I would just order the chocolate covered bacon on its own.  I've been here a few times, and the first time, our group was give pumpkin pancake with cream cheese type icing for free to sample. It was very dessert like and pleasant!  The corned beef hash is pretty good to order when hungry. I thought the crispy pancetta Benedict was a bit more memorable. Then again, I'm partial to the richness of Hollandaise sauce.   If you come here on a Friday morning close to when they open, then service is amazing. The waitress even told me to take a breath of fresh air instead of looking at my phone and focusing on taking foodie pics and actually enjoy the food. She was so hilarious and on top of everything.  Coming here on Sunday's especially around \"11am-noonish,\" good luck. There's usually a list to wait for a table and service will be hit or miss because there's just too many d@#n people to wait on. I'm not blaming the staff, it's actually really good that they're that busy but I can tell there's a little more stress around. Food remains un-compromised and just as tasty.",

    "text": "Eggstacy put me through many emotions on my most recent visit, let me tell ya.   My boyfriend and I arrived around 11am, and we were seated right away. It was a Thursday, and not nearly as busy as it usually is on the weekends. First, the hostess sat us at a dirty table, even though there were plenty of open tables available. Our waitress (her name was Madeliene) came over and looked a little frenzied, but took our drink order right away. I got a vanilla latte and my boyfriend just stuck with the cucumber water at the table. The latte was delicious when it arrived.  It took a while for her to come back and get our brunch order. I got an egg white fig and goat cheese omelette with a side of hash browns and toast, and my boyfriend got the \"Incredible\" omelette with a side of gluten free pancakes and fruit.   It wasn't our waitress' fault, but it took nearly an hour for our food to reach our table on a very un-busy day. When the food did arrive, my omelette was wrong and had to be sent back, so it took an hour and 15 minutes to get my food. She ended up comping my meal, comping the up-charge for gluten-feee on my boyfriends meal, and gave us a side of pumpkin cheesecake pancakes for free.   I won't lie, I was pretty upset when it took almost an hour for my food to arrive and then to have it be the wrong thing. However, our waitress really made it a much better experience with her kindness and excellent service. It was really all redeemed because of her.  I've been here many times before and I'll be sure to go back!",

Unfortunately that is the only good part since the wait staff is either inexperienced or understaffed because we barely got water, napkins, utensils, etc. To make matters worse the new items that the chef added are sub par at best   1. The spam sliders are mushed together sloppily and the taste of mustard is very overwhelming   2. The cotton candy pork belly is mainly fat and they over did it with the sugar  3. The Eggasm was the only decent plate  4. I asked for a strawberry mimosa and got a regular mimosa   What made matters worst is when the waiter asked I let him know the problems to which there was no comp'd meal since most of the food was left on the plate, no management was called, and no apology or attempt to rectify was made.  AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE. There are plenty of better places like Hash where they know how to properly treat a customer",

The three cheese omelet with the requested gruyere as one of the cheeses was outstanding-way too much for one person since it came with pancakes and hash browns but managed to eat most of it.  Husband ordered eggs bene and was pleased except perhaps a little too much mustard in the sauce. Daughter mentioned that it was my birthday so also received complimentary pumpkin pancakes - delicious.  Kelsey was our server, and she was the best! Attentive, pleasant, and efficient. Kudos to Kelsey! Yes, the place is noisy but not so much that we were bothered. The food was so good -  we enjoyed a delicious breakfast. Will most certainly return.",

When I called the owner over to speak w him abt the poor service , he not only disrespected me in front of the entire patio but proceeded to tell me off saying nothing was wrong w his staff or service. Really? That's why two additional tables left after seeing how rude he was to our party. I brought in a party of 20 ppl-- they could have made a killing off of us!

The menu looked incredible. That's it. Fell apart from there, 1) the service is horrendous. Our waitress and all others were unsmiling sourpusses who moved glacially. Had the restaurant been busy, then the wait to see a waitress and the wait for food would have been understandable especially if the food is great. They were not that busy. Call me quirky but I like a smiling pleasant waitress. 2) the poor service was not for want of staff. They were all chronically aggregated at the side doing nothing and when the food came out,  no one was sure where it should go. There was no expediter. Compared to restaurants like Butterfields which always has a line to get in, this was pure amateurish and clearly without a manager. There was a very young lady in the front that was pitifully unknowledgeable.  3) worst coffee I have had in years. They claim it is premium stuff. It was bitter and overly strong suggesting machine not cleaned and proportions wrong 4)never got to the food because watching this whole thing was painful and very slow  Spoke with someone that claimed to be the mother of the owner and she may have been the cook. She blew us off  Too many other options out there. A shame as menu appeared very promising",

The guy behind the bar said he was new and apologized in advance for his not being familiar with the bar. Wasn't a problem at all. What was a problem was the old lady wearing a mumu working behind the bar. From previous trips, I assume she is one of the owners. She was a horrible representation of the restaurant. Dressed like she just rolled out of bed, you could tell she had dark underwear on since her clothing was super thin. At least get hair and makeup were done. But this is the worst part. On several occasions, I saw her wipe her forehead with her hands, and then serve drinks. WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS. Then, she collected trash, pushed it down in the bag, and went back to serving customers. Again, WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS. I really hope this gets read by ownership/management, because there is no place for people like this in an industry where appearance and cleanliness are so important. And if she is indeed an owner, she should be ashamed and embarrassed. Have some class and give your employees the proper training and support so you don't have to be hands on in that capacity ever again.",

As an aside get a POS system that has the capability to split checks.",

Nobody at our table could even put a dent in the plates they were served. My husband and I agreed that we could've shared a plate and still been stuffed. They have a big menu with plenty of options (think Cheesecake Factory). Prices are moderate, but really affordable when you consider the amount of food.  The dining area is a large open cafeteria style with open kitchen-so loud, loud, loud.  For reference, a crying toddler could not penetrate the wall of noise. May not be an issue for some, but worth mentioning.",

    "text": "Just left after having breakfast here for the first time. Arrived at 9:53 on a Sunday morning. I expected them to be busy, and with a party of 5, I also expected to wait for a few minutes. We were told 15-20 minutes. Just before 20 minutes was up, the hostess sat another group of 5 that arrived after we had. I went and asked what was happening. The hostess pointed to a table in the back and said they were waiting for that group to leave so they could seat is there. Not wanting to cause a scene, I said okay and sat back down. 15 minutes passed, during which I watched them seat a group of 5 and another of 6, both of which arrived after us. I went back to the hostess stand and asked why other groups were being seated before us. All the girl said was that they were getting our table ready now and she was sorry, but it's only her third day. I repeated my question, which she had not answered, and they just hustled us along to a table, ignoring my question again. At this point, we were ready to walk out. The only thing that kept us there was the fact that if we went someplace else, we would have to wait again.  The 5 of us were jammed into a 4-top table. I ordered a veggie omelet with no mushrooms and a side of hash browns. My son got a veggie omelet with mushrooms and a side of fruit. When they brought the food, they appeared to have put the wrong omelet with the wrong side dish. I asked about it and was told that the one with hash browns was the one with no mushrooms. A few bites in, I discovered he was wrong. My supposed no-mushroom omelet did, in fact, have mushrooms. I guess the runner just wanted to avoid the hassle of double-checking. Good thing I'm not allergic to mushrooms.  I was incredibly disappointed with the apparent lack of caring demonstrated by the hostesses and the runner. The only reason for the two stars rather than a single star is that the food was indeed good, mushrooms not withstanding. I will not visit again, nor will I recommend to friends.",

The place is a little loud, which I actually thought made it more fun.  The menu is large and everything looks delicious. I ended up ordering the Camelback Panini with broccoli cheese soup. WOW, the soup was heavenly and the Panini was grilled to perfection. I also go to sample an omelet, a pancake, a side of sausage and eggs benedict. Every bite was better than the last.  I plan on dining here as often as possible to try as much as the menu has to offer!",

With that being said, they don't deserve anything more than 3 stars, at this point in time, because their service, wait time, and patio dining, are all subpar.  Service: After coming here 3 times now, I've had to wait 30+ minutes each time for my food to come out of the kitchen. Each time, I had to wait additionally after that for a set of silverware.   Wait time: It seems that 30 - 40 minutes is typical on a Saturday or Sunday morning here, which is fine for a busy place, so I can't really blame them for. They're just busy.  Patio: It's November, and still fairly hot on their patio. It wouldn't be so much of a problem if they had shade coverings to keep their patrons cool. If you choose to move inside after something has opened up, you may be in jeopardy of losing your food, cause they have trouble keeping track of the table numbers and their patrons.  Overall, I'd still recommend a friend to give it a shot, because their food really is good. Each time I've been here, I leave with a full and satisfied belly. Just frustrated through the process of getting there.",

The wait at butters was very long, probably because the food is amazing, so I settled for Eggstasy. When the coffee arrived in was cold and I had to ask for cream multiple times. I ordered the crab cake Benedict and my daughter ordered the avocado Benedict, the eggs were not only over cooked but resembled a piece of six month old gum you would find on the bottom of your shoe, simply disgusting. I informed my server of this and she put in an order for new poached eggs. The new eggs were delivered by the manager, a lifeless woman who seemed to be in an awful mood. She dropped the eggs off and left. Supposedly her daughter was sick and her day was not going great, newsflash, if your kid is sick take her home and figure it out. As I ventured into my eggs I saw not one but several fragments of shell. How the hell do you not see the shells when you poach the eggs, do you have eyes. The fruit was sour and shriveled, the coffee was cold and bitter, the hash browns were undercooked and lacked seasoning and crispness. I will never come back and I advise you, if you want good breakfast in Scottsdale do not eat here!",

    "text": "I stopped for breakfast because it was next to my hotel when I was in Scottsdale for work.  I got a good vibe as soon as I walked in.  It was homey, but modern, clean and fresh looking.  I ordered from the healthy section of the menu - a brie and green apple omelet!  I also ordered an almond coffee - unfortunately they were out of the almond, so I got a caramel macchiato.  The omelet came with a fruit shish kabob on the side.  The omelet was fluffy and big and yummy - I thought the brie would be worked into , but it was a big slab of it on the top!!  Perfect - better for the tasting!  A couple of mistakes by the staff - I ordered coffee in a to go cup, and it came in a ceramic cup, then they brought a hot to go cup, I finally asked for a cold cup with a straw, and the waiter said sorry - he couldn't find the right cup before!  They weren't even that busy!  But overall a very enjoyable experience. I also had enough food to have breakfast for the next day!",

I waited over 45 minutes the other day for takeout after being told it would be 15 minutes...last week, we picked up takeout and the order was wrong. The time before that, we never got our coffee or drinks, and the food came out before the drinks. We were charged for the drinks, and I said something to the waitress who didn't adjust the check, so I mentioned this to the owners, and they made everything right, which I appreciate, but the servers don't ever seem to care! I love the food so much that I can't lower the stars anymore than 4, but I refuse to go there anymore when it's remotely busy. It seems like 7 out of 10 times there's an issue.",

My daughter loved her sandwich, however, which was pretty and huge. Service was fine, within 15 minutes of ordering, except I would have liked my coffee refreshed.  Manager came to our table and I told him nicely and politely about the Benedict.  He apologized profusely and offered a dessert or a coffee to go and overall could not have been nicer.  I will wait a while and then give Eggstasy another try.",

My first time dining in was during the Waste Management Open event and enjoyed brunch on the patio. Ordered their Chocolate Bacon and Eggs Benedict. Food and service was perfect, only having to deal with the bartender and very few patrons at the bar. My last experience was far from perfect.. Walking in, there was no host/hostess to greet us and no one took an initiative to welcome or get us a table. Not a great start for the morning. After being seated, we were asked for our choice of drinks and food and then the service came to an end. No \"how is your food\", \"can I get you anything else\" or even a thank you at the end of breakfast. Our food was INCREDIBLE but without good  service, I will only be taking carry out from here in the future. Also, if coming here during the winter season, bring a blanket or jacket since the outdoor bar is connected to the indoor bar and lets in the cool air.",

Then the coffee they serve is Lavazza! The juice is squeezed fresh and the orange was delicious! Our server, Teeter, was phenomenal & patient with me. The food was plentiful and delicious! I love that they give you the option of potatoes or fresh fruit. In addition, you get the choice of pancake, waffle or toast (I believe). The meal was so fresh & tasty!  Furthermore, the prices are so reasonable for the portions. Teeter was so sweet and gave me cucumber water to go along with a cup of coffee. While the food was fantastic, the service & experience made the visit special and enjoyable. If I lived closer I would be there all the time. Definitely a recommended spot for breakfast or brunch. Bravo to Teeter for a great experience!!!",

They have their off days but most of the time we are well taken care of. We love this place so much that it's hard to try anywhere else.  My husband cheats on me by sneaking here mid week without me. I introduced him here, and now he comes without me! The hostess even knows his typical order!  I love their skillets - I get the veggie skillet minus onions (yuck). It's a great combination of broccoli, collard greens, tomatoes, and mushrooms under some crispy hash browns topped with Swiss and American (I think?) Cheese topped with scrambled eggs. Comes with choice of pancake or toast but i gret the English muffin because they're the best I've ever had. This meal is enough for me to have a 2nd breakfast.   Hubs orders the chorizo omelette which is fit for a giant. He never has leftovers.   We just love this place!",

My brother in law dish was completely wrong and not what he ordered.  Lastly my sister in laws breakfast panini was missing the bacon .  I must also say that we have eaten at this restaurant on a few other occasions and had good service in the past.  Yet this instances was beyond a bad experience, based on the food quality,  indifference by the waiter which seemed to not really care that we had issues.   The manager did apologize and took 20% off bill and sis not charge us for the wrong meal provided.  But we had to request to remove the dish from the bill that was never provided.",

Went with a couple of my friends Sunday morning, it was busy but we got sat relatively quickly, within 15 minutes I would say. Delicious food, A LOT of food in fact. Reasonable pricing, it was around $12 for my eggs/hash browns/bacon, and an additional $1.95 or so for the French toast side, plus $8 for my mimosa (I think a little overpriced for the size given, but oh well.) Great experience & would definitely go back!",

A lot of crepe options, pancakes, waffles, oh my. After the gal came over to ask for our drink order, we both immediately noticed she didn't look or sound happy. She wasn't rude, but she wasn't polite either. It was almost an attitude of \"here I am, what do you want\". My back was to most of the restaurant & the friend I was with commented that most of the staff looked unhappy. The few times I turned around, I could agree with her. No one was smiling, or when they did, they stopped after turning their backs on the person(s) they were smiling at. If the ambience of the staff was better, I would gladly give this place 5 stars. The food was worth a return visit; but not to this location.",

My first visit I ordered the Greek omelette, which was a little odd, but yummy. Most plates can come with a side of pancakes, and there's the option to upgrade them to certain flavors! Because of the amount of food, I split the Steak and Eggs plate my second visit. It was just the right portion for us and cooked well. For the pancakes, we upgraded to raspberry white chocolate, which were very sweet but tasty. We also ordered the Eggasm (easy egg over potato puree). Potato over bread was a bit much for me, but the egg was cooked perfectly, and the presentation was beautiful. The menu is extensive, so I'm excited to go try something new here!",

Today was my first time actually going in, and I've refrained from coming in because of the reviews I've read about the not-so-great service. After my experience today, I'm very aware of why people complain about the service and I probably won't eat from Eggstasy again.   We sat on the patio and waited over 15 minutes for someone to come over and greet us and take our order.   I brought my Mom here, and I ordered the Eggasm and my Mom ordered the Eggs Benedict. My food was except, minus the extreme amount of oil on my plate, but I was able to save my toast by removing it immediately.   My moms eggs were completely raw, as soon as she cut the eggs, they were slimy and raw and really gross. When I got up and brought the plate to the bar, the bartender was nice but our waiter was really rude and made me feel inconvenient. They remade my Moms meal but 20 minutes later mine was now cold, waiting for hers to come out. Her eggs were then hard boiled. I guess they don't know how to cook eggs. The ham on the Eggs Benedict was also thicker than the English muffin, which i found a bit revolting, but even cut in small slices my mom said was gross.   I'm disappointed.",

It now lacks quinoa. Except for the 12 pieces we were able to excavate from among the undercooked potato hash.   The brisket and gravy wasn't actually brisket at all. When asked about the brisket, our server assured us it was made in-house and was delicious. Well, maybe the grilled steak was made in house, but there was no brisket. And given how early we came in for brunch, it's not like they had time to run out of it this morning.   The lemon blueberry french toast was so bland even my kid pushed it to the side and asked if there was something else to eat.   We would have ordered something else except that our order took almost an hour to come out and we were so disappointed in the slow service and drop in food quality that at that point, we just wanted to pay our bill and leave.  Finally, we very clearly requested no fruit to be placed on any dishes because of a severe pineapple allergy. Remarkably, it came out on almost every plate. All that was done to rectify the issue was removing the fruit. Not helpful when you're that allergic to pineapple. Like hospitalization allergic.  What a disappointing turn for a spot with so much potential.",

First, kudos for having fresh squeezed orange juice, not to many places take the time and this one does.  So Fiancee had the crepes and I had the crab and cheddar omelette.  We did share as the crepes where huge!   The crepes had ham, mushrooms, spinach and cheese.  Very impressed, the crepe was perfectly done and beautifully presented.  There was the right amount of balance between the eggs, spinach, mushrooms and cheese.   Did I mention the portions size was huge??  Not kidding as we took a whole one home and I have a good sized appetite.   The omelette contained crab, cheddar cheese and had ritz crackers on top.  Couldn't understand the ritz cracker thing until I started eating.  Fluffy eggs cooked perfect with a rich cheddar throughout with a good size helping of crab.  Now this is where the Ritz crackers come in- as rich as the components are, the crackers provided just the right balance and saltiness to the dish.  Who would have thought.  At this point, anything you could have done to the hash browns or pancakes that came with the omelette wouldn't have mattered, but hash browns cooked perfectly and the pancakes I was again impressed.  Light, almost buttermilk but something different and by different I meant delicious.    Service prompt and polite.  Remember to come early or late on weekends as there sometimes is  a small wait  Overall, a great breakfast with a great atmosphere.  Probably my favorite place in AZ so far.",

The whole place was a bit chaotic.  We placed our order and my wife ordered a bloody mary...they were $10.  The waitress dropped the bacon that came with the drink...not a big deal...but then did not even attempt to bring her a new piece.  After asking the waitress to, she did.  The portion sizes are HUGE!!  (see my pictures)  The prices were good too.  Plenty of positives with the place, but overall the whole experience was mediocre at best.  Not sure I would return.",

    "text": "When we walked in for brunch on Saturday, our group of 7 was seated at a table right next to the bathroom hallway. The bathrooms smelled VERY strongly of sewer and urinal cleaner. We requested a move, and the hostess actually AGREED with us that it smelled bad...  When we moved, it took us a long time to have anyone come over to take our orders. My wine glass was chipped, and each of our mimosas came in different sized glasses leading us to wonder if we were drinking the same thing- or not.  We ordered the ham, asparagus and gruyere crepes- which were awful. The ham was diced up very small, it just fell out of the crepe, and there was no filling inside the crepes- just on top- also SMOTHERED in sauce. We also ordered the burger- which was really good. (not enough to redeem the restaurant). The only reason this review has 1 star is because of that burger.  The service was terrible. It was completely dead for a Saturday during a holiday weekend, and our server forgot our toppings for our burger (avocado, mustard, ketchup), and by the time she brought them over everything was cold. When it came time to pay our bill- our server had disappeared, and we were left with our plates in front of us (no one ever came to clear them).   All in all- one of the worst restaurant experiences we have ever had. We were visiting from out of town (we are from Dallas), and our friends were bummed because they said it was like night and day- they had come to Eggstasy before with a MUCH different experience. Hopefully this review helps them to take a look at their food and their service.",

The wait for a table is reasonable before 9 am on a weekend-- maybe 20 minutes. The bar made delicious fresh orange juice-- great for mimosas and screwdrivers. The coffee was also nice and strong. My only gripe is the service seriously moved at a snail's pace! The wait just to take our order was at least 30 minutes, and then another 30 minutes to get our food. Though, I have to say the food was worth waiting for. Everyone was raving about it around the table.",

I had the Gypsy Steak Skillet which was to die for and my boyfriend had the Smoked Salmon Omelet with a yummy Mascarpone sauce. The water is infused with Cucumbers, they do have regular water too if you don't want anything infused. We didn't have any juices, but they do have fresh squeezed juice available. The little 3 year old behind us squealed in excitement as his fresh orange juice was being made. The coffee is Lavazza and is delicious! Sarah even brought us some to take with us on our trip back home to Santa Fe, NM. I'm definitely bringing my little girl back to eat here to try the Mickey Mouse pancakes! Super glad our friends recommended this to us, we'll recommend it to everyone else!",

    "text": "One of my biggest complaints is to be out of menu items.   Ate here this past Sunday and based on a couple of other reviews, here, I could hardly wait to try the Pretzel Croque Madam.  Ordered it. Next I ordered what sounded quite refreshing:  Fresh Squeezed Apple Juice. Ordered it. Out of it. Damn. So I went for the refreshingly cold Apple Cider. Delicious.   Then my Croque arrived. The bread didn't look pretzel-y yet I held out for my first bite. Nope. It wasn't. I asked the server what was up. He checked with the kitchen. Pretzel bread was not available so they substituted an unknown, white, homemade bread of some magnitude without his knowledge.  Damn. Two thick slices of it. I deconstructed it by ixnaying the bottom slice with the mid-squirted glob of dijon mustard and finished it off. The server made-up for the bread faux pas with a comp'd glass of the delicious Apple Cider.   Another bugaboo I have with restaurants is staff members hanging-out at either their stations; the host stand or at the kitchen counter. Here, the kibitzers were at the kitchen's counter and the bartenders were chatting endlessly. McDonald's says it best:  \"You got time to lean, you got time to clean.\"  In closing, the decor is TOO WHITE.  The windows were wide open...the flies were overly aggressive. (The one fly that bugged me and The Beau the most left us to join the diners at the next table when their food arrived.).    I'm just not liking the vibe of this place. It was no Eggstasy for us.",

I have been here 3 times and the service has never been good.  The bar can take forever to make your drinks, which doesn't really make sense since they only have a limited bar menu.  Two out of the three times I have been here, they have forgotten someone's order, so the rest of the table is waiting and letting their food get cold while they prepare what they forgot.  The service in general is very disorganized and slow.  Last time I ordered the crunchy pancakes which my server told me were like donuts, and they came out burnt and super greasy.  They are literally fried pancakes - skip them.  I really wanted to like this place, but 3 strikes and you're out.  I won't be back.",

Our server was a super nice guy, right on top of refills and provided great service. I got the \"skinny b&$*%h\" burrito and the hub got a spinach omelet with gruyere and pine nuts with a side of fluffy pancakes. We both loved our selections and the portions were gigantic. I could have eaten the leftovers for dinner. Best part was the price, for the money we have not seen better and we have hit a lot of breakfast places in town. The only reason this was not a five star is the atmosphere looks a little rough inside. Decorations have fallen off of the walls and the paint and dry wall could use repairs. Conceptually cute, just needs a little love. Still, this is our new fav.",

After we got seated we waited about 5-7 minutes until anyone brought us water and we made eye contact with several people working there and we were ignored. We saw a couple tables seated after us get their drinks and order even before we got our water. We tried a couple of the eggs benedicts and the crispy pancakes and everything was delicious. The fresh squeezed and pressed juices are extremely refreshing as well. However, the subpar service and crowded room was enough to keep us away. It took several minutes to get to the exit weaving and asking people to scoot in and with a massive crowd of people blocking the entry it must be a fire hazard!",

I had an omelette with mascarpone, quinoa, swiss chard and prosciutto. I also tried the side of waffle & and it was deliciously crispy and not dense. It came with a side of fruit, some powdered sugar and maple syrup. I had the fresh strawberry orange juice and thought it was good but a bit sweet. I also tried the pomegranate juice which was also a bit too sweet but had a great tart flavor. My brother said the pancakes were fluffy and delicious. I'd love to come back to try their other dessert breakfast options.  There's plenty of parking and I'm unsure if they take reservations. Your party has to be 100% present for you to be seated. They have an outdoor patio area and a large indoor dining space. They also offer a bunch of coffee options like espresso, lattes, americanos, etc.",

    "text": "Pretty disappointing. While our server was very well versed in the menu options, all I wanted was a pancake and a couple eggs. Options included protein, fruit, potatoes and what seemed to be a host of other decisions that frankly took away the joy of having breakfast.   But so did waiting for what seemed like 20 minutes to get pancakes and eggs. When it did finally arrive, the portions were shameful.  One order of pancakes with berries came and there were 4 or 5 large pancakes on the plate. My order was 2 pancakes plus a skewer of fruit that should have been cut down to size prior to be served. It really was insane since we could have shared an order of pancakes and we still would have been unable to finish them all!    Our server was really on top of providing anything she could to make the meal pleasant but it wasn't her fault that it took so long. It might make some sense if there was anyone else in the restaurant but it was sparsely populated.   Finally, the pancakes had no taste which might be why they suggest you doctor their cakes with different toppings. This was a bust of a meal when it should be the easiest, tastiest and most reasonable breakfast possible. Big disappointment and wasteful too. Too many other options in the breakfast space.",

And they give you cucumber infused water, which I thought was nice.  I ordered the Brie, Apple, pecan and grape crepe which was good. The crepe was REALLY good but  I barely got and Brie in it which would be my only complaint there. I also ordered 1 poached egge which was PERFECT.  Like seriously it was probably the best egg I've ever had. And the hashbrowns as well were soooo good. My friend got the red velvet French toast which, I think she thought was good but REALLY rich.  She ate about 1/3 and then gave up and ate some hashbrowns and her eggs. They should offer half portions of the French toast. Place was clean, though the salt and pepper shakers were half empty which only bothered me because I work in a restaurant and I just think it's tacky.  Our server was friendly, and made recommendations. I think his name was tony.  He talked pretty quiet but was still very nice. Gal working at the front door was SUPER nice and very welcoming.   Overall I was pretty impressed expecially since they've only been open a week, I feel like things will only get better.  Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Sadly, my review of Eggstacy is not a good one. I was hoping this would be a new spot to go to since it is so close to my house and I loved the outdoor patio but I will not be returning. My son and I had breakfast here and being a server myself I'm very understanding of how a restaurant works and reasons why not everything could run smoothly, but at the same time I know bad service when I receive it. First off our server never came back to check on us, after 2 bites nor 2 minutes, yet the place was not overly busy. I ordered eggs Benedict, both my eggs were cooked completely through and I had to track a hostess down asking for a poached egg so I could eat my meal. Still, after finding her and bringing the new egg no sign of our server. As we were waiting my son is cutting his pancakes and finds a short black hair. He showed me and I said, bud you can't eat those, he was so hungry, he said no mom please it's okay I just want to eat. When I finally saw our waiter and informed him of the hair and incorrect eggs, he took my son's Mickey Mouse pancake but came back with a normal 2 stack, with whipped cream which I had told him please not to have on the first plate because my child hates, the waiter in turn blamed it on kitchen having him run out those. By this time I had picked at my meal but never ate, there was no apology, no manager precense or any partial refund or discount taken. All in all I would not come back nor would I suggest this as a place to eat in the area. Just very disappointing and as much as a love a patio US Egg is right across the street and never had I had such issues.",

    "text": "First time  to this place, very busy an noisy, thats ok.  The cappucino was very weak and took almost 20 minutes to get, almost coffee with froth on top.  The waffle was great, bacon also.  The french toast was also delicous but the canadian bacon was rubbery and tasteless and the hash browns were funky tasting.  The waiter was attentive BUT $42 tip  +  FOR BREAKFAST WITH NO ALCOHOL IS STIFF AND I CAN AFFORD IT. Will i go back yes but no cappuccino at $4 x2 and no canadian bacon at $4 no potatoes at $4 x 2 savings $20 +tax and tip.  There are other options around town like the Breakfast Club which is always consistant.  +-$32.  I give Egstasy a 78%.",

Tried the chocolate bacon...they must use really good chocolate like Belgian, but could not taste the bacon so felt like extra fat grams for no reason.  Hash browns were great.  Everyone liked their food, fresh squeezed oj good. Would have had a mimosa if I didn't have a cold.  Will go back. Want to try the banana Nutella crepes.",

    "text": "So i've been to Eggstasy three times and there are a few things that have been pretty consistent in terms of pros and cons.  Pros:  Really unique menu options and the food is really good. The staff is also very friendly.  Cons: It's really, REALLY loud in there!  I feel like I'm in a middle school cafeteria.  It doesn't help that they play club music which just makes people talk louder. The service can be really slow. I've either had to wait to have my order taken or wait to cash out.   They tend to mess up the order. The first time I was there I got the wrong pancakes. The second time I was there my omelet was wrong. I was there today and although I ordered the banana crepes, I got the french toast.  I can only assume they screw up the order because they can't hear me correctly since it's so LOUD!! They also tend to do a hit and run when dropping off the food. Not once in the three times I was there did the runner ask if I needed anything. As a result, I had to flag down or wait for the server to get ketchup, extra napkins or anything else for that matter.  Overall, if you want good eclectic food options give it a try; just be prepared to shout and get a slightly different version of what you ordered.",

They have a cute patio area that wasn't open yet but I can already tell will be a hit. Food portions are huge so you can probably split a meal or take leftovers.",

First our waitress told us how slammed she was while every other waiter was standing at the service window. Then the gusset is walking around chewing as he cleans up. The bosses mom runs the place and you can tell the servers have had no training. The waiter came up with our water glasses with her dirty finger nails and hands touching the rim of every glass. We also watched the gusset grab the water pitchers with glasses and stick it under his arm so we would have been drinking out of their arm pit sweat. I was thoroughly disgusted and will never eat there again.",

    "text": "I've driven by this place on my way home so many times and thought to myself, \"I should try that place for lunch.\"  Last week I finally did. I was pleased by the pleasant atmosphere and was promptly greeted and seated. My experience took a left turn from there.  The place was relatively busy, but not packed by any means. It took longer than usual for a restaurant in the area at lunch time to be approached for a drink order. Whatever, no biggie, there is an extensive menu and I was going to need a minute. I had time to review the entire menu, be indecisive, go back over the menu several times and finally arrive at a choice, and then sit and sift through FB before my drink ever arrived.   I promptly gave my order for one of their lunch panini sandwiches . The panini comes with fruit or french fries, soup and coleslaw. This puzzled the waitress when I pointed that out as she was trying to walk away and I asked what the soup was. She told me the soup choice, I said \"that sounds fantastic\" handed over the menu and she left. Eh, maybe she's new.  It took 10 minutes for the soup to come out (by someone else) and 20 minutes for my food to come out (by someone else). I'm starting to panic a little bit and think maybe I should just ask for a box but instead, I just asked the person leaving my food for the check.  She seemed a little put off by that request.  I've got patients to see and I can't be late so I need to pay so I can get out of there.  The food is marvelous. The French fries are so crispy, the soup was fantastic, the panini was really good and I have no idea about the coleslaw because it wasn't included and I didn't have time to ask for it. I'm scarfing down my food and I'm about half way done and the check has still not arrived. My server finally appears just as I'm putting sandwich in my mouth and asks how everything tastes, no smile. I say \"one second\" with food in my mouth, chew, swallow some and garble \"it's really good, can I get the check as soon as you have a chance?\"  She just nods and walks away.  I'm watching her now because it seems to me that everything is taking entirely too long. I've been a server so I can understand when you're running crazy. In this case, I watched her stroll about with zero hustle from task to task seeing what appears to be 3 tables including mine.  Typically when a check is dropped there is at least a nicety exchanged, \"thanks for coming\" or \"have a great rest of your day.\"  In this case, nothing, not even a smile. She strolled by and slid the check across the table without a word or even a look and walked off to the table behind me. I was floored. I have NEVER experienced that. I was already prepared with my card out when she dropped it because I didn't want her to leave again, but to no avail. She didn't even give me an opportunity. I finished my food and sat there waiting. Now I'm really panicked because I have 10 minutes to get back to the office and she's not coming back. I walk over to the hostess and ask her who takes care of the check. I watch as she takes it over to my server and taps her on the shoulder. The server gives her a \"can't be bothered look,\" rolls her eyes and processes my card.  I've worked in this area for almost 4 years. I don't typically choose fast food when I want to grab lunch and most places are able to get you in and out at lunch with plenty of time and are at least somewhat time sensitive. Usually I'm with 4 or 5 coworkers and we still get out in plenty of time. It is also common to ask for the check right away to speed up the process.  The food here was fantastic, the restaurant is beautiful and has great outdoor seating. I was thinking how great it would be to have a team meeting here. Not now, no way. I'll never go back there for lunch and my coworkers are aware and won't be either. If you're not on any time constraints and aren't necessarily concerned with customer service I recommend, otherwise, hit up U.S. Egg across the street. I have never had such terrible service and have never been inspired to leave a negative review.",

If you want to eat healthy, like my girlfriend, there is something on the menu for you. If you want to not eat healthy, then there is something for you too and everything in between. I normally get their omelets and create my own. Their omelets come with a side of 2 massive pancakes! They are the best pancakes that I have ever had! And you get an option for a side...whether it be has browns or fruit...get the hash browns..you won't be sorry! They offer freshly squeezed juices and other great drinks. Their service is fantastic! This place is always busy when I come so expect to wait a little bit. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Oh man, where do I start?  Finally hit this place up yesterday for brunch with a girlfriend and our sons.  Convinced the friend I was meeting today for brunch to go there instead of Postino!  The menu is fantastic.  We tried the prosciutto and asparagus flatbread and the pumpkin pancakes yesterday, and shared.  You get HUGE servings.  We had the prosciutto omelette today with a side of pumpkin pancakes because they were so good yesterday I had to have them again, and we shared again.  The kids tried the chocolate chip pancakes and were thrilled.  Couple suggestions:  -Don't sit at the bar unless you are in a hurry.  The service was WAY better in the restaurant.  Not thrilled with our service today at the bar. -The strawberry mimosas are great but only when stirred.  Ask for a straw and stir it up before you take a sip.  YUM. -Yes, it's loud, but that's part of the awesomeness.  It's super kid friendly and also adult brunch friendly.  Something for everyone.  Baby crying? That's okay!  Arguing with the husband?  That's okay!  This place will drown it out and you'll be so happy with your full belly and amazing food when you leave that you'll forget your woes. -Do NOT go there for the first time and not order the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes.  They are light, fluffy, and have a tad bit of salt so they are not as heavy and sweet as you would think a dish like this would be.  I can see why they are the signature.  WOW. -Their hash browns are off the chain.  Go with a friend, order any omelette (which comes with hash browns) and get the pumpkin pancakes.  They split it for you with no upcharge and it's enough food for 4 people. -Chocolate covered bacon.  Order it.  No questions.  Need I say more?  It's chocolate covered bacon!  This is our new brunch spot.  We've been loyal Four Peaks brunchers for years.  Glad to have a new spot to break things up a bit.",

The entrance has no markings on it so it's kind of hard to tell where the actual entrance is. After we went in, we were greeted by a hostess who took us to a table near the end of the restaurant. Our waitress was Selena. She was awesome! She was the best waitress we've had in years. She was always on top of everything! She patiently took our order (since it was our first time, we had some questions about the menu). She answered all of them. We opted for the Cheeseburger, Dali's omelette, and the regular French toast. The potions were HUGE! The burger was pretty good. The only thing bad to say about it was that it was a bit overcooked. Having asked for a medium, it was well done. He omelette was delicious and the French toast was great as well. Overall, we had a great experience and will absolutely return in the future! Hopefully we get Selena as our server again",

    "text": "We come to Arizona every March for vacation. We had a very good brunch here last year. This year I noticed from other reviews that they offered truffle egg toast, which I can get at Davanti Enoteca in Chicago and it's delicious. So I ordered it here today--and it came on cinnamon brioche. Not plain brioche . I don't know about you, but I don't find cinnamon to complement the taste of truffle oil and fontina cheese and asparagus. The waiter never came by to ask how things were so I picked off the egg and cheese and ate that. My husband had the breakfast burrito and it was okay, not great. I guess we won't be returning next year.",

I was there was a description because he doesn't care for banana bread and that's what it was, so it didn't really taste like french toast at all. I ordered the eggs Benedict it looked amazing but I was super disappointing because my eggs we over cooked basically ruined the meal. I've never gotten them served that way I thought the point was to have the yolk runny. Whatever I'm just going to Ive them the benefit of the doubt on being new.",

The patio umbrellas are completely broke.  The floors are not kept and I told my group to please wipe there shoes on the pavement before entering my truck.  The food quality was good but not great as it use to be.  I am worried this place may not make it even though it has a huge following.",

After that I got the chicken skillet and it comes with a side of pancakes, so naturally I got the pancakes with Nutella and bananas... You literally can't go wrong. The bartender, Aaron, was super sociable and the staff is running around like crazy because it so busy (that's because the food is so good so expect a wait).  If you haven't tried this place yet, do yourself a favor and get to Scottsdale and Shea and try it. It blows Breakfast Club and Butterfield's out of the water and believe me when I say that, I'm a foodie!",

After a bit we are told that we will have to wait 1hr 15min for a table outside in the shade, which we are still okay with. We decided to get bloody marys at the bar while we waiting and we see a party of 7 who had been there for maybe 30mins get seated in the shade outside. The hostess then tell us that our table is almost ready and points to one in the shade. Alright!  5 mins later they move the umbrellas to a different table of 7 leaving ours in the sun.. Really!!? We ended up waiting almost 2 hours for a table in the shade. I wouldn't have cared where we sat but my friends from Chicago were in town and really wanted to sit outside. Then the manager tells us we would get a discount since we were so patient, which they never gave us. This is not my first visit here and I'm disappointed we had this experience with our friends who were visiting. Again - great food, great server - just poor management.",

Sat on the patio on a beautiful Sunday morning. We were seated at a table that had food & napkins and trash left under it from the last people who had sat there. Several of the patio umbrellas were broken and falling down. Some were tossed off in a corner obviously unusable. The food was just ok. Our waitress Christa was nice and did a good job but I think we got lucky. The bathroom was disgusting, dirty, broken trash can so that you couldn't even throw your hand towel away.

I had an omelet (yummy) which I easily shared with my two kids: ages 2 and 4, and still had some leftover. I appreciated that our server suggested sharing, as opposed to swindling us into kids meals instead (though well have to get the Mickey pancakes next time just because they looked fun and yummy). My husband had the salmon eggs Benedict and he said it was fantastic. The orange juice was generous and fresh squeezed and omg the hashbrowns?? Even if the rest of the food was horrible I'd be coming back for the hashbrowns. Best I've ever had, ever. My potato hating husband even devoured them.  The owner, or person I assumed was the owner, was very present. He was helpful working with his staff by clearing plates and also making the rounds to check in with guests. Super nice guy!  Kid friendly, delicious, great vibe, we'll be back!",

Their mimosas are amazing and my boyfriend loved his Bloody Mary. Any breakfast place is going to be busy on the weekends but they were apologetic and brought waters out to those waiting.   Candace was our waitress and she was very outgoing and went over the top to ensure we had a good experience. Again, I think it might be geared more toward younger adults or a couples morning out than a family gathering place but it's a refreshing change! Just wish they served beer. ;) (they might actually, guess I'll just have to go back and find out)",

Ask for a straw. As the precipitate of the orange pulp sits on the bottom, shake it a bit to taste both the orange and the champagne. I didn't get our waitress's name but she greeted us as we sat down and took drink and food orders with a smile. That's the attitude I want to see.

    "text": "I have been looking for a go-to breakfast place in the area and finally came across Eggstasy on Yelp. A group of us met here on a weekday morning, and were fortunate to find seating immediately. The large interior was clean, with tables spread across the large floor coupled with great natural lighting. The ambiance was relaxed, casual, and the noise level was high. They have an enticing breakfast menu, with the support of a juice and espresso bar, and a kitchen that delivers an array of savory and sweet dishes.   The Heart Healthy Omelette ($10.95) was gigantic, with plenty of egg whites to wrap around an abundance of turkey, artichoke hearts, red onions, and low-fat cheese. The dish also included fresh fruit on the side to give breaks to the savory flavors. It was delicious, healthy, and satisfying.  The Red Velvet Cake French Toast ($9.95) was made with a dense and moist red velvet cake. However, the buttermilk flavor was hidden from the warm sweet icing that also competed with the chocolate shavings. All together, it was better than the version at Wildberry, but also very rich and too sweet for the morning.   Crispy Pancakes ($9.95) came with large in-your-face pancakes deep-fried to crisp that still carried a nice chew. It was served with a delicious caramel dipping sauce that nicely complemented the burnt crispy part of the pancake. It was highly addictive and I had to have the last bite.   Service was friendly and attentive. Santi and I tried to return on the following weekend, but the place was so packed that we decided to go elsewhere. As a lesson learned, interested diners should consider calling in ahead of time to get onto the wait list. To date, Eggstasy is my top place for breakfast and brunch in the area for its large portions, creative dishes, and unassuming ambiance. I would be interested in returning to try their Pumpkin Cheesecake Pancakes, Stuffed Brioche French Toast, and other Omelettes.",

The place was busy, but we called ahead to get on the list and were immediately seated on the patio and served fresh coffee.   After much deliberation, I ordered an egg white omelet with goat cheese and fig preserves, fruit and an English muffin. The portion sizes are massive, so come hungry! It was fantastic, perfect ratio of cheese and preserves, the fruit was fresh, and the homemade English muffin was delicious.   Our waitress was lovely and made sure our water stayed full. If I had to nitpick, I'd say extra umbrellas outside would be nice because it got HOT, but it's Arizona. Duh. Our orders came out staggered. One person at the table had to wait an extra 5 minutes or so to get his food, but whatever. It happens. Other than that, everything was excellent. I would love to return and try everything on the menu, it all sounded so good!   Side note: extra points for them being dog friendly.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place, the food is amazing, and have been here 10 times or so, but the last time I was there with my girlfriend, we both could agree that the service was absolutely ridicules. I didn't catch our servers name but it was some kid with white gauges.  It was about 2 in the afternoon, and we get there and it is fairly slow. Our server comes around to ask for our order and I tell him that we aren't ready yet. He revisits us about 10-12 minutes later, which is a littler longer then usual but nothing I would really complain about.  We put in our order and the food comes out fairly quickly and is good as always. At this point out waters were empty and were never filled for the rest of the time we were there. We are both fairly quick eaters and finish everything in about 10-15 mins. I'm a server myself so i was putting plates stacked up on one side of the table to kind of give him a hint that we were done and could use some service. But we ended up not seeing our server for FIFTY MINUTES after he dropped off the food. He did not check up on us or anything, we could watch him as he was doing all his side work as we sat there with no food or water left in front of us, contemplating if we should just leave. Finally at 2:55; five minutes before they close, he drops off the check. Finally i give him the 2 cent tip he had earned by neglecting us the whole time we were there, as I leave I thought, finally we are done here.  But that's not all... He literately comes out to the parking lot to confront me about his shitty service, and I told him how he didn't check up on us for 50 minutes and we were ready to leave after 15, then he complained to me about how he's losing money off this crappy tip, and quite frankly, I don't really care. Learn to serve or find a new job, I will not return unless I know this guy no longer works here. Sorry",

I always sit at the outside bar which is always nice when we have beautiful mornings. This morning as I was sitting at the bar servers were working hard making the vegetables that go in the bloody Mary's. Then out of the blue one of the kitchen managers came out yelling at the same two servers! Yelling at them to stop what they were doing, immediately...to shut it down, because she was getting yelled at!  This was the same job she had told them to do! I've never seen any manager yell like that infront of customers. I felt so bad for them. It was so demeaning and sad. After that the owners mother was yelling ordering servers around while she is wearing open toed sandals in the kitchen and behind the bar area, even when she was running food out. I always thought open toed shoes violated AZ health code.",

    "text": "First visit today, and I was not impressed by the food.  Service was very good, though-- look for Shea, and at least for this morning, he was at the bar/counter.  I came in and was surprised by the number of people waiting outside (it was very chilly!), and even more amazed to see the line of people waiting to be seated inside.  And then it hit me, it's a Saturday-- I'm usually at work at this time.  A Yelp friend even warned me last night about the long wait times on the weekends, but I was dining solo, so I figured I could wait for a spot to open at the bar.  I ended up waiting for four minutes-- not too shabby!  Found out that the chocolate syrup in the cafe mocha is Hershey's (corn syrup), so I opted for a cappuccino. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eggstasy-scottsdale?start=100&select=LQ43uEfOvZzDUBGcY_q4hA#LQ43uEfOvZzDUBGcY_q4hA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eggs...</a>  LavAzza is the coffee sold here, and I like LavAzza, so far, so good.  Shea was nice enough to provide me with some receipt paper so that I may jot down a few of the entrees I had questions about, and he gave me his suggestions from the list of items I wanted to try, and I ended up ordering the Lemon-blueberry French toast <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eggstasy-scottsdale?start=100&select=CXV8FUkYF-yixQdKW1BIIA#CXV8FUkYF-yixQdKW1BIIA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eggs...</a> and Fried truffle egg toast. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eggstasy-scottsdale?start=100&select=J1on-3kAP9IHxQNws194sQ#J1on-3kAP9IHxQNws194sQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eggs...</a>  As I mentioned, I wasn't impressed with the food.  First of all, the presentation of both items wasn't pleasing.  There's a reason I posted so many of the Fried truffle egg toast, and that's because no matter how many times I spun that plate around, I couldn't get a decent shot!  Also, the plates were not staged in the best way, but then again, perhaps there was no way to make them appear any better...  The pancakes were sweet on their own, but I added the last bit of pure maple syrup that the kitchen could spare, and it tasted a bit too sweet after.  They usually come with blueberry compote, so I'm assuming it was omitted due to my corn (starch) allergy.  This dish needed a cream sauce to add another layer of texture.  Otherwise, it felt like moistened and heavy pound cake to me.  The Fried truffle egg toast needed more salt, but I was hesitant in adding any more, so I added Tabasco sauce, instead.  The two eggs were sunny-side up and gave the brioche a nice color, as well as good mouth-feel, with the combo of fried bread, egg whites, and melted gruyere.  This dish needed something else, though, besides seasoning.  Some Canadian ham, perhaps?  Or a few slices of extra-thick bacon, or two, or more cheeses?  Yes, this dish, as well as the pancakes, had the makings of something great, and today's offerings do not make me want to order them again.  Two lackluster entrees at the same sitting normally wouldn't make me want to visit again, so why am I eager to go back?  Because of the cool service Shea gave me, of course!  First, he never made me feel like I was an imposition, asking so many questions and sending him to the kitchen with a list of concerns (better than asking him to memorize the questionable ingredients and the four entrees I had my eyes on).  Second, when I asked him what kind of chocolate enrobed the bacon I spotted on a neighbor's Bloody Mary <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eggstasy-scottsdale?start=100&select=iiKKb5DG5ApDBjBUEq3-pQ#iiKKb5DG5ApDBjBUEq3-pQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eggs...</a>, he guessed Hershey's syrup, as well (I guessed Valrhona, or something similar), but offered to double-check with the kitchen and came back with an apology that it wasn't Hershey's (I kinda knew), but a Belgian chocolate.  But wait, here's the kicker... he excused himself while he grabbed a saucer and napkin and reached into the mini-fridge for a slice of chocolate-covered bacon for me to try (shh! don't tell anyone)!    What service!  Now, I haven't had a chance to taste the said bacon slice, but I plan to ask for Shea's section- hopefully it will be at the bar, where the wait time is shorter- whenever I stop by!  Oh, and third, Shea offered to give me a cup of coffee to-go, which is probably a standard service here, but still a nice touch!  p.s.  The cappuccino was very good!",

    "text": "I've been here about 20 times, and still I rate it \"meh.\" I went for these positives:   (1) drinks - great bloody marys, mimosas, and they serve illy coffee (2) ambiance - I love that it's light, airy & open  (3) decor - modern clean lines (4) service - very attentive and prompt (5) outdoor patio access with a great outdoor bar.  The only thing I'm not thrilled about is the food. I've been pleased with the basics - an egg and toast or a plain waffle. But I can make these things at home - the point of going out, to me, is to eat something that's too troublesome for me to make myself.  My main complaints are that the food simply is boring to taste, and they seem to think that tweaking classic dishes is imperative to their brand. But sadly, to me, their take on these classics isn't even close to how good the original is. Some examples- their BLT, Cobb salad, and baked steel cut oatmeal. The only steel cut oatmeal they offer is baked and sliced in loaves. I tried it, and it was impossibly dry - gulping water didn't even help.  Same with the BLT - it was oddly dry. It also had avocado on it, which is great, however, assembled, the bacon was too dry, the bread too dry, and the other veggies in the sandwich couldn't counterbalance that excessive dryness. I didn't like the Cobb salad because it was served on field greens lettuce, instead of romaine or even iceberg. Swapping the field greens out didn't work, to me, because the texture of them didn't hold up to the other ingredients. Field greens are too delicate for the traditional Cobb salad ingredients. Again, I found the salad DRY! (How can a salad be dry!?!?) I asked for more dressing, which still didn't seem to make the plate any better. I wasn't impressed with the omelet I ordered either, on another visit. I had the veggie omelet (onions, peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, mushrooms, cheese), but it had minimal cheese and there wasn't anything special about it - it simply wasn't flavorful.  I know the issue isn't me because I never complain about food being dry elsewhere - I enjoy the food at First Watch, Snooze, and others and don't find their food dry at all.   I loved taking my out of town guests here just for the ambiance and vibe, but I've since stopped because I'm just plain sick of paying for food I don't like. I end up wasting more than half my meal because after so many bites of attempting to resurrect the dish, I just give up and my appetite is spoiled. No ambiance is worth that price. I hate that I don't like their food because I love the idea of visiting with my dog on the patio, how close it is to my home, etc. The only other negative is that they don't accept reservations.  I've not been back in over a year, but the menu I see online looks to be the same. If the food was better, I'd probably visit every other week because it's so close to where I live, and I truly love the decor, ambiance, and patio.",

    "text": "I very much want to give Eggstasy a 5 Star rating because they could easily get there.  Their menu is fantastic and offers new twists on traditional items as well as every go-to favorites.  The first 5 or so times I've eaten here the food and service were both top notch.  Unfortunately, this hasn't been the case the past two weeks.  The quick points are: My nephew waited 50 minutes for his pancakes- no apology. We loved sitting there watching him eat! We ordered a single side egg but were charged for a full kids meal, although the waitress told us we wouldn't be charged at all.  There was an extra order of pancakes on the bill.  I didn't catch it until I got home, my fault, I guess.  Today, same single side egg showed up as a full kids meal and was being charged for it.  It looked like the eggs sat under the warmers for a while.  I never received one of the sides I ordered, but it was on the bill.  The Mickey Mouse pancakes looked like an after-thought.  It was just three pancakes arranged on a plate.  They forgot the chocolate chips and just brought a small side instead of remaking them so they're cooked in the pancake.  Hash browns were crispy on the top and uncooked on the bottom.  The Greek Omelette didn't have any feta cheese in it and it was overcooked. The menu says the Greek Omelette is $12.95 but I was charged $14.95.  This was all disappointing considering we waited quite a while for our food.  I really hope they can spend some time training their servers better and more importantly, get their food quality back up.  I hope this place will be awesome again one day.",

We were asked to sit at a table that was dead in the middle of two other tables. Not even my 8 year old daughter could fit to get to the table. The hostess just looked as we struggled to get to the table. Bumping everyone next to us. Even during our breakfast we were bumped while others left and more came. It was very uncomfortable. We waited for our server. Our appetizer (or foreplay) came with the rest of our food which both took forever. Two of us were missing pancakes and other side orders. My daughter didn't get her meal until we were almost done with ours. I kept asking but he said it would come. The food is cool to Instagram and it taste good. I just wouldn't be back.

    "text": "As a party of six, we were smooshed into a small, long booth. I definitely did not complain, as I realize the restaurant was full. However, I was left sitting less than 12\" away from a customer belonging to another party to my left. We both apologized to each-other several times as we bumped elbows. We both mentioned to each-other that it was unacceptable how closed they had placed the two separate parties.   Second, our arrogant, rude and just plain odd waiter came to our table, about 4-5 minutes after we had been seated. Because I have been here before, I know how the waiter/waitresses typically behave. Typically, they uphold acceptable customer service, know the menu well and are upbeat and pleasant. They make the experience enjoyable. Today, we experienced the polar opposite of that.  I also know that typically the waiter/waitress will ask if you would like cucumber water or strawberry water. Not today... he just poured cucumber water in our glasses and didn't say a thing. I asked if we could have the strawberry water instead (honestly, we don't like cucumber water) and he rolled his eyes. He was irritated we had asked, and made sure that we knew it.   He walked around the restaurant making weird facial movements and looked as if he was drunk or hung-over. It was rather odd. Actually, I have never seen anything like it. My husband mentioned that he continued to \"adjust himself\" as he was walking around. My father in-law saw him picking his nose. He would lean against the bar where the food was prepared for delivery. Honestly, it was disgusting and I was about to ask to switch to a different waiter/waitress. However, we were afraid of the aftermath of doing so. At this point, we were used to being ignored... and honestly, should have left. I would much rather have spent my morning somewhere else.   We waited for coffee to arrive to the table, and he dropped it off without asking if we were ready to order, without spoons, and without cream (we waited over ten minutes). We finally were able to order, about ten minutes later. The facial movements and odd behaviors he exhibited were just disgusting. It's almost as if he was drooling, or unable to control what he was doing. As he was taking our orders, his face was uncomfortably close to mine.  He asked me twice what I wanted. At this point, I was ready to leave. Again, should have done so.  I felt mortified that I had recommended this restaurant. After we awkwardly placed our order with him... we never saw our waiter again. Honestly, he went home.   Next, our food began to arrive... the first dish in a timely manner. Yes, I realize we were a party of six, and that it can't come all at the same time. However, it took about 12 minutes for all of our food to come to the table, correctly. It was continually brought by different waiters and waitresses, who continued to act confused and continued to ask what we were missing. One waitress said, \"hmm... that wasn't written down\". We were also brought two other items that we didn't even order. Obviously, our waiter didn't take the order correctly. Oddly enough, we were not surprised.   Food was okay. Sadly, it was cold because we wanted to be polite and wait for our table to be served in its entirety before we began eating. The food was sub-par. My omelet lacked flavor, so I had to add a significant amount of salt. The pancakes were spongy, and not their normal consistency. None the less, it was just plain gross. It was not Eggstacy's fine quality that I had mistakenly upheld them to. I can never recommend the food to anyone, ever again.   We were never attended to again. No water refills, no service. No, \"How is the food?\". No, \"Anything else I can get you?\". I gathered many empty plates that were scattered around the table, and someone eventually came to grab them and dropped off a check, without saying really anything.  We asked the new girl were our original waiter went. She said, \"oh... oh ya, he was really, really sick and went home.\" What?!?  Seriously?!? Too sick? Too sick to handle our water and coffee? Too sick to lean into us to take our order? Too sick to lean on the counter where ALL the food was being prepared?!? It's a good thing I don't work for the health department, or that would have warranted an immediate shut down, or at least investigation. She didn't say much else, never apologized or offered any semblance of empathy. Should she have told us he was too sick? No. She was yet another employee not trained on proper customer service. here was a clear lack of leadership presence and that was evident in all aspects of what we encountered today.   At this point, I was seriously about to lose it. I excused myself to the restroom to walk away for a few minutes. Queue the next problem: (I'll bet you guessed it...) the absolutely disgusting restroom. Fecal matter on the sides of the toilet, an overflowing trash can. I can't continue, I actually feel like vomiting.  Bottom line: don't go.",

However, I got invited to a birthday brunch and unwillingly found myself at eggstacy again. It was a group of 8-10 of us. Our service was poorer than it has ever been. The waitress kept forgetting items and we had to ask several times for certain sides or refills on beverages to be brought to the table. Someone ordered a very basic meal but needed her pancakes to be gluten free and they messed this up several times.   We asked for the manager who honestly was no help at all which to me is beyond frustrating.   I will not be returning and was very disappointed with this place.",

Our waitress never came back after food was delivered until she dropped the check. She didn't give refills without being flagged down or check to see how things were prepared. Had she done that, I would have let her know that my over medium eggs were REALLY under-done, and my pancakes were dry, crumbly, and not even warm enough to melt a pad of butter... my husband, who typically eats everything placed in front of him no matter what, only ate about half of his meal, though he couldn't tell me what exactly he didn't like about his.   So, yeah, probably not coming here again.",

    "text": "On the first day of our holiday \"Eid\", many people like to go out with family for breakfast. We had plans to go somewhere else, but that place failed to provide us with our expected table for 20. When we got there they said the wait would be 1-1.5 hours! We weren't prepared to have 20 people wait - including kids - for that long  Eggstasy was our second option and it should have been our first! With very short notice when I called and asked for a table for 20, they said, plz give us 10 min! We made it in less than 10 but just as they promised, the table was ready on time! He place was full so we were so pleased that they were still able to have us despite how busy they were.   We all were seated and given the menus. Bottles of ice cold cucumber water were all over the table. We were asked if we wanted coffee, many of us said yes and we all then placed our orders. We asked for separate checks and that was managed properly.   I ordered First Street which is a chicken panini with a side of fries and my husband ordered a veggie omelette with a side of pancakes. His order also came with another side option so he picked hash browns.   The food came out in pretty reasonable time. My order also came with a soup (potato and leek soup) which was creamy and delicious! The sandwich was just good, nothing extra special. My rating for it would be a 3.5. My expectations of a sandwich that has sun dried tomatoes, artichokes and basil as well as mozzarella was much higher. I didn't taste the basil which would have made the sandwich more flavorful.   My husband's omelette and side of pancakes were great as per his feedback.   Kaitlin our server was superb. She was very friendly and efficient. She took all our orders carefully. We had no mistakes at all despite the large group, variety of orders and separate checks!   Overall, excellent service with pretty good food. Temperature in the restaurant was a little uncomfortable. They tried their best however to adjust the AC and window blinds to accommodate us better. Since I am egg sensitive, I unfortunately cannot try their egg options which could be superb. Would definitely recommend it though based on service and overall quality of food.",

But what I don't get is why you would call a grilled fig butter and a single slice of cheese sandwich a grilled cheese. This sandwich had so much fig butter on it, I could hardly find the cheese. I was asked when I ordered if fig butter was O.K. on the sandwich, which I was excited about! However, I didn't expect a half-inch of fig butter, I expected a smear to enhance a cheesy sandwich. $10 really? More than one slice of cheese would be nice. In regards to the other issues, It took an usually long time to get little things like coffee and water. Also, why the cucumber? Ick. And holy moly, it was hotter inside than outside. The party had several very pregnant ladies in attendance, and I can only imagine how uncomfortable they must have been since my normally cold self was uncomfortably hot the entire time were here. I recommend not wasting your time or money on this over priced egg place.",

Stopped by here with a group of about 10 for a Sunday brunch and it was pretty spectacular.  To put it simply, the place is VERY popular on a Sunday morning.  I would definitely come in with a reservation like we did.  The atmosphere inside reflects its popularity.  It was bustling and there was a lot of action going on.  I was honestly pretty impressed by the speed and attentiveness of our waitress during our meal.  She came by and took our orders very quickly and our food and checks arrived just as fast.  Incredibly efficient, which was great considering how many people were looking to get inside.  I ordered the Denver omelette with hash browns and wheat toast.  It was quite possibly the largest omelette I've ever received at a breakfast restaurant and it was very delicious.  I typically have no trouble finishing a meal, but in this case, there was so much yummy goodness on my plate I couldn't even finish all my toast.  Talk about first world problems!  Eggstasy lives up to its name - I'll be back for sure!",

OK I'm ready now...really.   First,  I enjoyed the nonsensical nature of your review, what with the misspelling and run on sentences.  But, I guess those are the symptoms of \"FDS\" (fragile derangement syndrome).  I mean c'mon..I read 4 lines of your review before I ever saw a period.    OK.  Enough. About that.  I don't believe shaming people online is the way to go, and I just wanted you to feel what it is like even only for a second.  I want readers to know that what  I read in Jaki's review is an absolute \"360\" from my perspective, after enjoying Eggstasy for more than a few years.     The manager you write about is a very kind and thoughtful person.  I've personally experienced this kindness myself, but also observed her kindness to other people on multiple occasions.   Remember this.  The people in the service industry should have enough respect from the patrons that should not include various outbursts of childish misbehavior (like: \"shutting this place down\").  I think everyone should work in the service industry.  If everyone were required to do this, there would be fewer terrible people in the world, and I'm sure a much more polite place.  Hmmmm....I guess we all can dream Jaki.  PS:  Eggstasy rocks and everyone I've ever come in contact with there are amazing hardworking people including the great manager mentioned in the review above.  PSS:  I'll give a smile to anyone that can spot a spellin error in this review.",

I adore breakfast/ brunch and this is most definitely at the top of my list for brunch hotspots in Phoenix/Scottsdale. The menu here is insanely diverse & there's truly something for everyone here!",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place, I really did. It looked so cool and had a neat menu. I didn't mind the 30 minute wait for my table, but... First of all the place was absolutely chaotic! Servers, food runners and bussers running into each other. I watched a table get wiped down 3 times by 3 different people with a dirty cloth that smelled like a school cafeteria. There seemed to be no communication with each other bc everyone seemed confused. I ordered a juice which took longer than it should bc they have one juice area and it was crowded with servers.  Now for what I really minded... My food took about 35 minutes to come out and when it did, it was all wrong and tasted terrible. Hash browns are made in house but even after ordering them crispy, they came out wet and undercooked in the center. The only thing crispy was the outside. My eggs were ordered over medium but came out so undercooked. Just white slime on top. The sausage links are butterflied and you get 2 links instead of 3 like every other breakfast place. They obviously slice them so it looks like more. I didnt really mind that bc I can never finish 3, but I didn't like the taste. My English muffin was thick and doughy, not toasted. DISASTER! I just sent it back and asked for a pancake after they offered me something else. It never came... It was a complete waste of an hour and a half that I could have had for holiday shopping!  The 2 stars are for the really nice hostesses up front",

Also tried a special of the day which was an omelet with a sweet corn relish and braised beef which was really tasty. The omelet was super fluffy but hash browns were crispy to he point of being dry so I wasn't a fan. And my boyfriend said the toast, despite looming really yummy, was weird and not good. Service was good!",

The omelet I ordered had great filling, but way too many (overcooked, rubbery, greenish) eggs surrounding the good stuff.  My boyfriend had some decadent stuffed french toast and he was happy in sugar high heaven.  We also ordered coffee and bacon, as those are our litmus test items for breakfast places.  The coffee was just ok and the bacon was decent.  The restaurant itself was clean, bright, and had a good vibe (very friendly wait staff).  I did note that the main dining area was really noisy.  Definitely won't be bringing Grandpa here.  Huh? What?  Never mind.  Overall, *shrug* - we're 50/50 on this place.",

We came to this place a couple of times before and didn't notice how disgusting it was until recently. We sat at the bar and watched the chaos unfold as one waitress yelled at another waiter and then burst out into tears and then continued serving tables slamming and throwing things, followed by an entire staff under the age of 25 who had no idea what they were doing. They did not clean up anything after themselves and some of them didn't even look old enough to be behind a bar handling food and fruit with their hands. Behind the bar was a complete disaster everything all over the floor, trash, flies...absolutely disgusting the kitchen didn't look much better but at least the food was okay. hopefully you can cook out the disgustingness of what I saw. Absolute disgrace, the manager of this place really needs to clean up his staff and run a tight ship. Service was incredibly poor as well. Not Scottsdale material.",

We tried to get past it but that was an impossibility.

We called last night for a reservation for our party of 11+ a baby hoping to have a nice breakfast with our family from out of town. This morning, because of how large our party was, we called to verify that they really did have our reservation and they said they did. We arrived 15 minutes early to make sure they wouldn't give our table away. They told us they had a table but they were just waiting for some people to leave so that they could push a couple more over. We expected 15 minutes of waiting in the heat, we could manage that, but it was bordering on 30 minutes with a four month old baby in the Arizona heat and it was far less than ideal. The whole reason we waited that long: they gave our reserved table away. Knowing we had a baby with us. They finally got us into a table in a less than ideal space but at least it was still inside. The service was good but it doesn't exactly make up for having a hot and cranky four month old, two hot 83 year olds, and three hangry teenagers with their 6 parents. Plus one breakfast was overcooked to the point of inedibility and they neglected to listen when our grandfather asked to bring the bill to him and instead left it at the opposite end of the table.",

    "text": "We were salivating.  Our first time here was on Halloween.  Food was just  awesome after finding this place by mistake.  Full plate of food...hot...cooked right...we each had the two egg breakfast plus sausage.  The only bad was we had to wait a few minutes for the bread but that didn't amount to anything. So last Saturday when we were up again from Tucson we drove 10-miles from our hotel to Eggstasy even though we had a zillion places to go in between.  We couldn't wait. We ordered the same plates this time.  Once again...no toast.  But they served me the wrong eggs.  A few minutes later they re-served me...but we still had no toast.  We kept our plates covered with napkins while we waited.  Then the toast showed and away we went.  Our toast was not warm.  My hash browns were barely warm and way under cooked.  Sausage was OK.  Eggs were barely warm.  It was obvious they took back the original plate, cooked new eggs while the plate set, then they brought it back out with the proper eggs.  We didn't see our waiter until we were almost done eating...not good.  He asked how it tasted and we lied and said \"OK\".  But another 2-minutes went by and we realized we should not have lied.  Everything was cold.  So we told him about it and I said I was done despite having half of my cold food still on the plate.  He apologized and said \"he hates under cooked slimy hash browns too\"...but nothing came of anything.  No offer to replace...no manager...no discount.  So we paid...I left him 10%, not sure why I tipped him other than we're not troublemakers.  Then I wrote on my receipt things like \"cold food\", \"near-raw hash browns\", \"rip off for $30\".  Then I set it on the counter by the line where the manger was and walked away.  They looked at the ticket but did nothing.  I guess they have so much business they don't care.  Good for them.  Dispute going to American Express for this $30.  11/25 12:19 Ticket Y42 Server is Shea S  $33.60 total.",

Went on a Friday afternoon and was seated right away even though they were pretty busy. The decor is pretty contemporary with some of the larger tables with bench seats. Seems like they try to make it like a open casual home feeling.   Shared the Denver Omelette,  asked them to substitute asparagus for bell peppers and they had no problem. Also substituted the buttermilk pancakes for the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes. Also shared the fruit Waffles and ham kaseri crepes.  The omelette was good but if this makes sense tasted more like a bunch of scrambled eggs than an omelette. The pancakes were good but did not wow me.when the pancakes came out it looked like a glob of melted marshmallows on top of the pancakes. The hash browns were good and crispy the way they should be. The Waffles were done very well as was the huge portion of crepes.   The interesting thing was the cucumber water, kind of different but okay would prefer just plain water.   Overall the place is nice food is average to good and was nice to try a new place.",

    "text": "This place was completely under-whelming. My experience varied from mediocre (at best) to unhappy (at worst).  Our group of 3 arrived at 12:30 - well after the breakfast, brunch, and lunch crowds, as evidenced by the fact that there were only about four or five other tables occupied. We were seated at a small table in the southeast corner of the dining room, at a table that had food on the floor underneath the table. Despite the low attendance, the place was so noisy that we could barely hear each other.  There were flies in the window, and the black grout on the floor showed all the schmutz that had not been adequately cleaned from between the tiles - many of which were lifting and even more of which were cracked.  I asked for the 1/2 sandwich and soup order, but was told that it was not available with the sandwich I preferred (the B.A.L.T. - bacon, avocado, lettuce, and tomato sandwich). So I just ordered the B.A.L.T. - only to discover it comes with a small bowl of soup! Why didn't the waiter (who was attentive, by the way) let me know that?  Not only did the menu NOT state the the B.A.L.T. comes with soup, but the menu did not mention that the B.A.L.T. comes with a dill pickle. I really do NOT like dill pickle, and I would have asked that it be eliminated if I had known it was included. To make things worse, not only was there a pickle on my plate, but it was swimming in several teaspoons of dill juice which completely soaked the bottom half of my B.A.L.T. - making it soggy and - to me - unpalatable.   I enjoyed the content of the deconstructed sandwich which I ate open-faced.  The soup, by the way, was warm but not hot.  So, a noisy and dirty restaurant with incomplete information on the menu and luke-warm soup.  I will not return.",

I don't understand how that happened because it was very quick. My pancakes were a mess. I ordered the cinnamon toast pancakes and they came out drenched in this gooey sauce. They were not hot either. I attempted to get the managers attention but she was too busy to acknowledge me. Oh well, there are a number of breakfast restaurants in the area to try.

There is a major attitude among them and a serious lack of communication and as a consequence of this, the wait time for myself and my family went from \"10-15 minutes\" to almost 45 minutes today. I'm surprised we even stayed. The hostess would point to a table that was being cleaned and we would be next to sit. Our table was given away, this happened twice. Then one hostess said there was a table available but it was unlikely that a highchair for my baby would fit.... well obviously that doesn't work. This sort of instance has happened too many times and I'm sad to say that it's unlikely we will be back to this location.",

I'm a HUGE breakfast fan and good breakfast food is hard to come by in Charlotte. In Scottsdale, it's pretty easy lol.   My husband and I got here early, and most places in Charlotte make you wait to be seated until your whole party is there. But that didn't matter. We were seated and told the rest of our party could join us once they arrived! That was a bonus. Loved that!   We took a LONG time to order. The menu is big and there is a lot to choose from. Our waiter was super friendly and was very patient. He was great! I'm sad that I don't remember his name. When I do, I'll add it to this review.   We ordered so much! We had 3 appetizers, and we each ordered a meal! So much food to share. We loved it all! There is too much to label so I'm just going to share the pictures.   The food came out quickly. The restaurant was very clean and well kept. Our server kept an eye out on our drinks and we never were left on empty. The food was DELICIOUS. I highly recommend that everyone come and try this place. When we come back to visit, this restaurant is the top on my list!!",

The paninis are cooked perfectly, not the smooshed soggy thing sometimes one gets. I recommend the fresh fruit, because it's not just melon (see photo).  One visit I got an omelet with pear and something else, but it was awful. I'm not seeing it on the menu, but I do recommend sticking with omelets that do not include fruit. Soup of the day was displayed lovely, and the kids marshmallow pancakes are sweet and cute. Great coffee choices as well.",

(Maybe flour and bread is that expensive (?). ) I'm sure breakfast is done perfectly here our lunch items were done perfectly.  Expect breakfast to be around 20$ per person. (Drink/coffee and tip included in that 20$.)  Five stars are for the chicken avocado sandwich, cheese burger, fries and sweet potato fries.  Yes they are that good. We will come back just for those items.  Plus the price is spot on for what you get. The burger is grass fed beef. I like little details like that.   LaVazza is the coffee they serve. Yum! It is my favorite coffee. You can taste the roasted flavor.  We will come just to have coffee here on days we are over fed and need caffeine.",

Extensive breakfast and lunch menu. Portions are huge (six egg omelettes)! Most meals come with a fruit skewer and your choice of pancakes or toast. It's only $3 to upgrade to specialty pancakes or French toast so I do every time.   My favorites - fire grilled asparagus skillet, stuffed brioche, Greek huevos rancheros, barbacoa omelette, and the buffalo chicken wrap.  I honestly believe food wise this place can do no wrong.   5/5",

I had to ask our waiter twice, 2nd time interrupt him from a chit chat session at the next table for extra syrup...better yet rewrite the recipe for the pancakes..awful!

    "text": "DELICIOUS!!! So this place was delicious but it definitely had some cons to it.  I ordered the chilaquiles and instead of chicken I subbed for chorizo. It was amazing!! The flavor of the sauce they used was perfect and not spicy. The problem was there was an up charge for chorizo instead of chicken, which chicken costs more so that was weird. The orange juice is literally a MUST and to die forrrrr. It was so good and freshly squeezed.  I also ordered a side of brioche French toast wbu h was HUGE and I could barley eat one bite but it was very good.  Cons: the hostess wasn't friendly and at when we got there or leaving. She honestly looked like she didn't even want to be there.  The service was super slow and just okay and we had to flag down our waitress for refills. It also wasn't very busy.  My little brother ordered an omelette with no onions and when it came there were onions. So the waitress asked \"does it need to be remade or can he eat it?\" Umm no we asked for no onions in the first place so obviously remake it. This took some time and we were already almost done eating. It's also kind of pricy.  This is 40 min away from my side of town and we drove here to try it so idk if I'll ever make my way back but if I'm in the area I will for sure eat again.",

We also had the prosciutto and chocolate chip waffle which was tasty no complaints, and the sun-dried tomato, goat cheese, and pine nuts omelette which wasn't very good.

The bar is half inside/outside which leaves the restaurant and open format. It would be pretty stupid of them to bother even running the AC if they were. You can guarantee your party some nice sweaty horseshoes by the time you leave.   2) Drinks- The couple we dined with each ordered a vanilla latte. After 15 minutes of still not receiving a latte, we decided the only way to push through breakfast was to order a round of mimosas. Get this, each mimosa was delivered one drink at a time. Not sure how they keep their doors open when the bar can mix one drink every 5 minutes. By the time food came we were on 2nd round of mimosas ... still latte-less.  3) Food- Half way through eating ONE latte arrived. Bravo. The last arrived close to receiving the check. Enjoyed the frequent interruptions of staff trying to deliver other tables food to us while in the midst of stuffing my own skillet down my throat. Our friend also never got his order of pancakes which in the end was fine being that he had no latte to wash it down with.   Suggest scrambling your own eggs at home or try Hash Kitchen, Breakfast Club, Sumo Maya. Even IHOP has reliable AC.",

They got their food first and we waited for ours about 5-10 minutes after theirs. We got our food finally and i got the barbacoa omelette with hash browns.  The food was just ok... I've definitely had better. The flavors were kind of boring and i feel like i could have made a better one myself at home. The presentation of the food looked better then it's taste. I will however give this place another shot... i believe in second chances. I may just order something sweet like the French toast or something.

We ordered a three cheese omelet, veggie omelet and a spinach and blue cheese omelet with goat cheese substituted for the bleu cheese. We also ordered a side order of Apple Gouda chicken sausage. Unfortunately, as has been noted in previous reviews, the restaurant is extremely noisy. While some might find this pleasant, I go out for breakfast for a social environment and not being able to hear my table mates is a downer. In addition, it clearly impaired the servers understanding of our order because she came back twice to clarify the goat cheese substitution on the bleu cheese omelet and also thought we had ordered Apple Gouda chicken sausage crepes, both of which were clarified. Despite this, somehow I got a veggie omelet with goat cheese. Definitely not what I wanted. It could have been avoided if the server had repeated the order when she took it.   The omelets are huge and when served with two pancakes are more than enough and none of us finished our omelets. I would suggest two people splitting an omelette as an alternative to waste.   Overall, I would have to be in a specific mood to eat, not converse and would have to make sure the order was correct to go back. A shame because I think it has potential but not with the decibel factor is generates.",

Can't beat it! Others in our party had omelets which were packed with various add-ins and comes with a side of pancakes. Even the coffee, which is Lavazza, is very good and your cup rarely has a chance to be empty since our waitress kept our cups full all the time. The service is great for such a busy place we had just the right amount of attention paid to our table. They have a great outdoor, dog friendly patio too.

And I was pleasantly surprised that it came with a large skewer of fresh fruit on the side. We only had coffee, but they have a pretty extensive list of fresh squeezed juices I'm looking forward to trying. Atmosphere is bright and the vibe is great! Very friendly staff that were right on top of everything we needed, despite being packed with people. Extensive menu that will appeal to just about anyone. Love this place!",

It was frustrating because they have a limited number of seating for two people so larger parties were being seated before us. Once we were seated the service was very slow and we only saw our waiter twice. Once to take our drink order and once to take our food order. Once we got our food my boyfriend asked for maple syrup and never got it. Also, we observed that the table of four next to us who were seated way before is finally got their food and we were already done. What?! The food was ok. The experience blew.",

I got an omelette with caramelized pear and brown sugar and it was delicious. As was the raisin walnut toast it was served with. The butter was freshly whipped so that was nice touch. Hash browns were just ok and could have been cooked a bit longer but it's hard to mess up hash browns too bad. I will ask for them crispier next time. Husband ordered red velvet pancakes which again could have fed three of him. He really enjoyed them as a special breakfast treat. Basically dessert! They were topped with chocolate sauce too. They have nice outdoor seating here too. Please just put the mimosas on the menu though haha.",

Our last visit we went right after our workout. The food is good, portions are large and they have excellent coffee (my demise).  However, on this day, we sat at the bar. The bartender refilled my iced coffee with hot coffee and more ice. I took a sip and the bottom of the glass blew out. A FULL cup of warm coffee spilled all over my pants and nikes. The bartender throws me a fist full of napkins. As I continue cleaning myself off, the bartender moves our plates down a few spots so they could mop up the floor. She runs to the back to consult with the manager (i assume, although no one ever came out). When she comes back she asks if she can make me a fancy latte to make up for spilling coffee all over me, ok thanks.  After a brief sorry and a latte, we get the bill. They comped our coffees. So not only so I have drenched pants and Nikes that are stained and smell like coffee, I got $6 worth of free coffee. Super.   I was incredibly disappointed and baffled with how they handled this siuation. No apology from the manager. This just goes to show how much they value their customers. I will not likely be back.    Me and my coffee drenched Nikes will be at US Egg across the street.",

If you don't like your job, find something else to do, don't ruin my day just because yours isn't going well.  -came in, host was nice -sat down -L came and poured us water, walked away -once again, never been here. Would of been nice to explain a bit of the menu -L two tables away, starts yelling to us asking if we wanted anything to drink. Really? You couldn't wait until you actually approached our table?  Ordered two bloody Mary's  -for all the fuss about the bloody Mary's, they actually had no taste, very disappointing  -L come by again asking if we are ready to order, before I could even say anything, she turns her head and walks away -about 2/3 minutes later, she comes back and asks what we want -my friend had a few questions, of course, and L seemed irritated to answer -I asked about the eggs Benedict. Got two options, later to find out they have about 6 different ones to choose from. And yes, she looked annoyed about that as well -about 30 minutes into it, our food has yet to come -I look around and notice 3 tables, who came after us, are already half way through there meals -I look up trying to find our waitress and see her by the kitchen, she starts walking to her section and notices that we still don't have our food -runs to the computer and puts our order in -comes to the table and blames the kitchen for not getting the \"prosciutto\" right. - don't ever LIE to your quests, if you were honest, I would of understood, shit happens. But don't tell me 3 orders went in, but ours simply didn't go through the system. Are you fucking kidding me?  -on top of that, don't blame the kitchen, take fault for your mistakes -I got up, stopped the order, called for a manager -took off our drinks, obviously.  -asked if we wanted the food to go on the house. After the worst service ever, no thanks. Offered coupons or whatever for next time, no thanks. I didn't complain to get free stuff. Your servers need to be taught better.   I'm not one to complain, people have their off days. But this one, I can't even put in to words, of how I felt. So un welcomed.   It's unfortunate, your food has been talked up by many.

The food took forever to come out (being with two young kids was not fun with the long wait), our bill came out to $80 with tip ( 2 kids and 2 adults). The omlete was over cooked and didn't taste good at all (don't remember what the name was but it had a balsamic glaze on it). Never again coming her again!",

    "text": "Such a let down. From the service to the taste this place fell so flat. I will say that the inside of the restaurant is really cute. Very open, chic and inviting. But that's really the only thing worthy of stars. Our server was barely functioning- had zero enthusiasm and gave zero shits about giving us good customer service. Seemed like he had partied hard the night before. My boyfriend asked what kind of feedback customers gave about a certain dish and all he could muster was that a lot of people order it. So he ordered the truffled brioche and asparagus toast with fontina and egg which sounded great. And the food even looks really appetizing. Photo worthy for sure. But the food was soo bland. Neither of us could taste the truffle, and I love sweet and savory together but the brioche in this dish did not work. I ordered the brie and apple omelette off the healthy side of the menu which I expected to not taste as good as something more decadent but the eggs were so flavorless.  It seemed like there wasn't any brie inside the omelette, only one big piece on top. I also requested spinach be added, which it wasn't. I didn't want to wait for a new omelette so I asked for a side of vegetables which he declined to accommodate. We did not make very big dents in either of our dishes (which a good server should notice) but ours was completely oblivious to almost everything. He wasn't rude but needs a serious wake up call. This a breakfast place where everyone should have a sunny disposition and at least act like they've had a cup of coffee. For a place located on Scottsdale and Shea this was a pretty big disappointment. Save your time and money and eat elsewhere.",

    "text": "How this place has 4 overall stars is beyond me.  I took my son here a few weeks ago & I'm still ticked off about our experience.  First off, let me start with the only positive thing I have for this restaurant...it has a very cool modern look and feel, which I like. Now for the rest of our experience...the music is so loud you can barely hear anything else, so I opted to sit outside.  The patio is quite large, but has absolutely no shading from the sun, it's Arizona, the sun is out 95% of the year!  I had to move my son 3 times to try & keep the sun out of his eyes.  Next, it took over 10 minutes for anyone to come over & greet us, and take a drink order.  When the waiter finally came by, I could barely hear him or understand him because he was talking so soft, I swear he was on something by the way he was acting.  I asked if we could go ahead and place our food order since my son was getting really hungry & restless.  I ordered buttered noodles for my son and bacon and eggs for me, it took 40 minutes to get our food!!!  The place was not even that busy.  I will say that the eggs were really good, but when I picked up the bacon, the grease dripped off in a huge puddle, like it was not even drained off, yikes!  Now for my son's food, he will eat just about anything you put in front of him, but as soon as he put the noodles in his mouth he spit them right back out, I have no idea what they did to them, but he just wouldn't eat them.  I told the waiter when he finally walked by again that he just couldn't eat them & asked if I could I order something different & he said that was fine & he said he would take it off the check.  I asked him to see if they could rush it & 25 minutes later, still no food for my son, I called the waiter over & he said the kitchen was really busy & couldn't give him a timeframe as to when the food would be out (again, not a ton of people in there at this time), so I said to just cancel the new order & asked if I could have the check.  He brought the check & it still had the buttered noodles on it, so I called him over again and reminded him that he said he would take it off, he then proceeded to argue with me about taking it off the check, I asked to speak to a manager & he told me that no managers are employed there...what?!?!?!  He finally got snarky and said he would take it off. Not a good experience at all for us or for the other 4 tables around me from what I observed.",

I have no idea why this place is so busy, except that while looking around at the high school age filled tables, I can guess. The only bright point in this adventure was our waiter, a young kid who was trying his best to salvage the disaster of food the kitchen had sent out. I'll spare the description of food, it's not worth it. We sent it back and it came back worse (did not eat it). The noise level in place rivaled the interior of a crashing jet, but the food would probably be better on the plane. Save your time, your money, your hearing and make just toast at home, it'll be a better experience.",

My wife had the sun-dried tomato, goat cheese & pine nuts omelette, pretty Plain Jane. I had the same problem with the asparagus, ham & gruyere crepes. I'm sure he is just using a Swiss cheese and not a True gruyere. This is the type of guy who seems more worried about prices than quality. My daughter did enjoy her chocolate chip pancakes.  I saw the menu online and thought this place might be a delicious change. It was not. Again, I'm sure that quality is 2nd behind price when this guy does his food buying! We won't be back.

Takes another 5 for the server to come back by and another 5 to get the cream. By that time the coffee is cold. No talk of specials or of taking an order. Meanwhile, servers / runners are dropping food around us, coughing on food and generally looking sluggish, unmotivated and confused.

    "text": "I had an unfortunate experience this morning at Eggstacy. When I arrived and put my name on the list I was told that it would be about 25 to 30 minutes for a table. We were pleased when we were called after a 22 minute wait. I was going to complement the hostess on their accuracy in estimating the wait but it was so noisey and crowded I just tried to keep up with her on the way to the table. Water came and I asked a bus boy for coffee and he gave me a signal for \"just a minute\". He didn't return and a server hadn't arrived although tables seated after us were being served, so after waiting 15 minutes I went back to the hostess and told her we hadn't had a server yet. She promptly went behind the bar and got one of the women working there to come out to us.  We placed our food order and I asked for coffee. She said she'd be right back with that.  After waiting several more minutes with no coffee I took our cups and walked up to the coffee station at the bar. Seeing me do this, our server rushed up to me and said she'd take care of it and es courted me back to the table. Delicious coffee!  We both finished our cup and I began looking for a refill. During this now 30 minutes that we've been at our table, we've been watching the to-go boxes placed on the window sill between the indoor and outdoor space blow off the sill into the high chair seats with the bus people swirling by picking them out of the seats (think babies in diapers in those seats) and putting them back on the counter. Finally a big gust of wind blows them onto the floor. A good natured bus boy makes a comment about them, gathers them up from the floor and puts them back on the counter to be used. After 45 minutes at the table with still only one cup of coffee our food comes out and it is delicious. The server says he'll be right back with our side of pancakes.  Coffee finally came round again.  It was another 10 minutes before the side of pancakes come out. I spread the room temperate whipped butter on the pancakes and they were completely cold and the butter didn't melt. Oh well. I really didn't need them. We flagged our server down for our bill and gave her our two credit cards. She comes back to the table and informs us that both of our cards had been declined. We had her try again and guess what?  They worked.    The manager came around once while we had been waiting and asked how things were. I was telling her about the service when a gust of wind came in throwing the to-go boxes and she got distracted by the commotion and lost her attention and didn't turn back to us.   While the food was good, the service was so disorganized that we did not have a good experience.  They need some training!",

Every employee that greeted us seemed genuinely friendly. They were attentive without being overbearing. And the menu! Oh, the menu! So many unique options! It took us quite a while to make up our minds. We decided on sharing a sweet and a savory dish. Our fantastic server Elena split our dish for us. We shared the quinoa, kale and sun-dried tomato omelette and splurged on the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes. Wonderful choices! The pancakes weren't too sweet. My friend got the fresh-squeezed orange juice. I had coffee which was served with real cream. The carafe of water on our table had cucumber in it. Every detail was perfect! I wish I had discovered this place earlier! I'll be back soon. I want to try the chocolate covered bacon!",

My first visit to Eggstasy was quite pleasant, and this is why we decided to pay this place a visit again. Based on today's service, I don't that I will be back here anytime soon. My server was not only inattentive but seemed very apologetic when she made a huge error on my wife's order. My wife and I are always very explicit when it comes to not having any pork or pork products in our meal; I let the first 4 mistakes slide (steak not cooked appropriately; hash browns not cooked correctly (to her defense, she did correct this after I told her); other tables being served before us; and having to hunt my server down to explain the mistake on our order). Finally after I expressed my disdain for the service we received, our sever did finally right her one wrong. But what bothers me is, she only righted her wrong, because I had to tell her how disappointed I was with our service. I am not willing to give this place a 1 star, because of our service the first time, but I would hope that management understands that servers need to be extra cautious when it comes to food allergies and requests, because this could be a law-suit waiting to happen.",

    "text": "If you don't like eggstasy, then I don't like you.  Honestly, best breakfast I've ever eaten.  Steak and egg skillet was fantastic.  If there's two of you, split one.  Then order a SMALL PORTION off the \"eggstasy\" selection in the back of the menu, I highly recommend the brioche French toast or the pancakes with pumpkin cheesecake sauce (make sure to order the pancakes crispy.)  I've never tasted anything like either.  The chorizo grits are also tasty (just like chilli), but you won't have any room for sides.  So obviously I love the food.  Service:  been there twice, Candace and Michelle are GREAT.  Michelle actually insisted on sending us home with to go cups of coffee (for no extra charge.)  Everything comes out so fast, it'll boggle your mind.  The owner, Pete, gave is extra pancakes out of the blue, on the house.  I honestly felt like I was a part of some social experiment where scientists were studying my reactions to insanely delicious food at fire sale prices.   Price:  30 bucks for a fantastic meal for two?  Including coffee?  Hell yes. Wait:  been there twice, waited 20 min at the bar the first time (the bar tender kevin is now my boy), sat right away the second. Ambiance:  too loud, but I didn't really care.  There were flies because it's an open air restaraunt, honestly the only thing that bothered me at all. Pretty sure this is the first review I've ever written.  That's because this place is the shiat.  Not really sure how they're gonna stay in business for very long with those prices, so you might wanna get in the car now.  I SAID NOW! Ps if anybody happens across any of the recipes for any of the dishes at this restaraunt, I will pay you one million dollars. Pps Pete, if you're reading this, why aren't you open at 11:21 pm?  Also, I would consider nominating you for the Nobel peace prize if you implemented delivery.  Maybe if you delivered to Syria, ISIS would chill the phuk out.",

Service from the hostesses and our server Tara was prompt, friendly, and attentive with genuine friendliness that one doesn't find everywhere.

The waitress was really nice and told us the portions were big so my daughter and I choose to split a French toast.   The food was cooked perfectly and the whip cream tasted like cool whip, which reminded my of my childhood. I liked it but I know some people don't.   Overall service was quick, the food was good, and it was a nice atmosphere.",

The amount of syrup they give is not enough to cover all of the food and it's not warm syrup as you would except it to be. Very busy place and I am not sure why because the taste of the food here as well as the service is mediocre. They do serve a lot of food but I personally would rather have a smaller portion but taste good versus the other way around.",

    "text": "Another noisy yuppie Scottsdale breakfast spot. There are no booths just wide open room AND open kitchen which makes for a very noisy breakfast, shouting across the table at 9am on a Sunday and the place is only have full. I`ve read how the portions are huge, yes in deed, like Denny`s huge. Personally, I would rather have a balanced breakfast with enough food for the meal. I did not go here to have a meal AND get take out. Instead of 4 enormous pancakes and no sides, I prefer 2 pancakes, sausage/bacon/ or fruit. Why am I paying to have leftover pancakes that will be gross afterwards. Most other breakfast places I will get a cloth napkin. Here its one cheap paper napkin similar to mcdonalds. Those don`t work very well cleaning up syrup.   About the sanitary conditions, I did see the bartender put fruit garnish in a drink with her bare hands, GROSS! With what sounds like a culture of unsanitary conditions I would prefer my coffee creamer in sealed portion cups. Who knows how many of those silver, open portion cups they condense to serve new ones.   Food was meh. Banana macadamia pancakes just crumbles into pieces. Maybe because the stack was 4 high, its impossible to get a nice cut and not have mush. The sauce just tasted like pure white sugar. Why are my sausage links cut in half length wise? How about the presentation of nice golden brown sausage? Most up the staff looked under 20 years old and it showed in the service. Ugh never again at this place.",

By the name Eggstacy, we were expecting an out of this world egg breakfast experience. We ordered coffee, fresh squeezed strawberry pomegranate juice, the fried truffle egg toast, stuffed brioche french toast, prosciutto flat bread, a side of bacon and hash browns. The main dishes ranged from $12-14 each.  Service was great and our food came within 15 minutes after our order. The portions are huge and initially the food looked inviting.  Fresh squeezed strawberry pomegranate juice-Delightful, crisp and refreshing. Highly recommended!  Coffee-Not particularly smooth, a little bland, average.  Fried truffle egg toast-It came out as two pieces of French toast. The first piece had the fried egg, asparagus, fontina cheese, and truffle butter. The serving was large and was sufficient to leave one feeling very stuffed.  Prosciutto flat bread-This was our least favorite dish. It seemed like the prosciutto, roasted tomatoes, asparagus, parmesan, fried egg, and balsamic reduction was carelessly tossed onto the bread. It was extremely salty.   Stuffed Brioche French Toast-This was our favorite dish and works well as a breakfast dessert. I loved the stuffed mascarpone, bananas, and nutella.  By the name Eggstacy, we were expecting spEGGtacular or EGGcellent, but instead it was just rEGGular. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here or wait, but if I were in the area early in the morning, I might try it again.",

This is a popular spot due to its prime location on Shea & Scottsdale so it is a bit more noisy than average. The prices are on par with most other Scottsdale locations, a little bit on the pricier side. I had the Dutch Apple French Toast ($12 after tax). The French toast was just two huge pieces of Texas toast with some apples on it, no sides. The French toast was very good, albeit a little overpriced. So all in all, a solid Scottsdale Breakfast spot with a hipster atmosphere similar to Hash Kitchen.",

The atmosphere was overall every chill-too chill almost. There really wasnt much professionalism and mostly just experienced a lot of friens like behavior, like calling us 'bae' and 'omg'.  There was four of us ans our server was pretty nice, but he forgot one of the orders and ended up comping it. The food was okay, the pancakes were definitely my favorite part of the meal. Prices arent bad depending on the item. $10 for a large omlette plus hash plus pancakes.  The one thing that really bothered me was the fact that the server really insisted we try the chocolate covered bacon. It was very pushy and not just a suggestion. He ordered two plates for us, which I thought wasnt right of him to do. Also, it was not good at all. Chocolate was soft, bacon was floppy and cold, the flavor was just strange.",

The hash browns are the best, nice mix of crunch and generous seasoning for excellent flavor. The Benedict with crispy prosciutto was recommended by my server and was a great selection, prosciutto was thinly sliced and cooked up like bacon, only crispier, and smokier. The poached egg (just the very teensiest, slightest bit underdone) and hollandaise (very lemony, yum!), over a monster of an English muffin from a local bakery. Portions were HUGE - half of my Bene and most of the hash browns are in the fridge for tomorrow. Service was excellent! Hostess, waiter (Junior), co-owner/manager, and water servers were very attentive, friendly, anxious to please, and delighted to share all the details on anything related to the menu or local restaurant biz. Like that the terrific and spongy English muffin came from Strictly From Scratch bakery, who are also the suppliers for Scramble and recently bought Chompie's. Who knew? Can't wait to return and try some of the funky crepes and omelets on offer! Also:  Coffee is strong and good and plentiful, but needs to come with a spoon for stirring in cream.",

    "text": "Overall a disappointing experience.  The restaurant is very trendy looking.  It seems like it should be in LA.  The menu is filled with intriguing options and interesting choices for those who like to not eat a boring breakfast.  The meal started out with rancid \"fresh\" pressed apple juice for my son...obviously not so fresh.  A second stab at it returned another slightly less rancid tasting juice.  At that time I just said forget about it.  My wife and I had bloody marys, described to us as the best you'll have.  They came with a piece of chocolate covered bacon and a useless skewered garnish of 1/2\" thick green and red bell pepper rounds and 1 green olive.  No matter how much I stirred I couldn't get any flavor out of the bloody mary, I even added more salt and it was tough to get \"the best bloddy mary ever\" out of it.  My wife only took about 3 sips.  We ordered our breakfast.  To my surprise the waitress came back a third time and brought me apple juice that was not rancid and was quite delicious.  The savory food was overwhelmingly underseasoned with the exception of the prociutto benedict, which was so salty it was difficult to stomach.  I had the crab dip omlete and again, no flavor, the cheese was only in the the very very center and not throughout the omlete.  We added a cheesecake pumpkin pancake and it was OK.  The pancake was moist and yummy, the sauce could have been a little richer (It tasted like a loose cream cheese frosting).  Finally the banana nutella crepe was very good, but it would be extremely difficult to mess that up.  The waitress was attentive to our needs until the end when we needed to pay, then she couldn't be found.  Our card was sitting in the checkbook, upright, for 10 minutes.  The prices are very high for a breakfast establishment.  The tasteless bloody mary will set you back $10, because you are paying for chocolate bacon and bell pepper that do not compliment a bloody mary.  The icing on the cake for me was being charged $5.50 for the apple juice after being served not one, but two rancid apple juices.  I've been in food and beverage nearly my whole life and I would never charge a guest after screwing something up twice.  I'm not saying that they may not shine, but for the price I would expect nothing short of spectacular and that is not what my family received on August 29, 2015.",

I loved the bright indoor/outdoor space and the modern details. Our waiter was very friendly and was clearly trying hard, but the whole staff seemed to struggle with the volume of customers. The kitchen timing was way off - for example, all of our dishes came out as once except for one, which took more than a half hour to arrive after everything else. At one point, a second waiter brought over some plates. We started explaining what went where when he rolled his eyes, slammed our plates on the table and said, \"I'm too busy,\" before running off. It was so inexplicably rude. At the end of the meal, our waiter kindly explained he hadn't charged us for our coffee, but \"didn't hear\" when we responded that we had purchased our coffees at the car prior to being seated. I would probably go back for the food, but I will expect to have a long wait and potentially rude service.",

    "text": "The servers at Eggstasy are exceptionally, eggceptionally?, nice and helpful. Even the manager twice checked in on our table during our recent visit. I would suggest that you take the advice of your server when ordering. The menu, as structured, is a little confusing. Their advice is not the typical effort to encourage you to trade up or add on expensive extras. It's actually helpful.   Any complaints about Eggstasy? It is loud. On a Sunday morning you can hardly hear yourself think, much less your tablemates' conversations. A few well placed acoustical panels might help, Much better on weekday mornings. The Eggstasy section of the menu, which contains all of the restaurant's unique featured items, appears last in the menu, a curious choice. The portions of these items are huge. You do not want to order them unless you are sharing. Server suggestion that you order an egg oriented menu item and then select a side from the Eggstasy list is the way to go. Why not just lay that out on the menu?  Love the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes, although the cream cheese topping is a bit overwhelming after a few bites. The lemon blueberry French toast is delicious, but is heavy and resembles a banana bread. Not what you might expect from the description. I'm anxious to see what other surprises there are in the Eggstasy portion of the menu. Everything there is dessert-like, however, so be forewarned. A side order, as part of an egg dish, is definitely the way to go unless you have a massive capacity for carbs and sugar.  Have not eaten here with kids in tow, but they do have a kid's menu.  The total tab, for two of us, was $33 including tip. Not unreasonable. Just Scottsdale pricing.  The restaurant decor is a bit mid century, a bit industrial, a bit hipster, a bit modern; that is, a bit fun. The outside patio, which was full when I first viewed it, actually made me laugh when I saw it empty. A good thing.",

Loved the presentation of the fruit on a skewer!  Crispy prosciutto was really good.  Corned beef hash was not especially flavorful, so would not get it twice.  Pancakes were amazing and full of sugary flavor.  Coffee was good so I would definitely get it again -- I dont like strong coffee.",

    "text": "At first glance/ taste it's an ok place...  We showed up about 10 o'clock on Saturday my mother in law and sister in law got there first so they got us a table we came in sat down seems pretty nice they had cucumber water on the table and a cute little plant in the middle. The music was a little loud and for the size of the big round table I couldn't hear what was going on on the other side of the table. There were six of us total my husband and I and our two youngest children, and then my mother in law and sister in law. My mother in law ordered 8 chorizo omelette with fruit skewer, my sister-in-law ordered corned beef hash and a banana pancake thing. Husband ordered steak and eggs and had stuffed brioche which had banana and I had the corned beef hash and the stuffed brioche also. My son had  mickey mouse pancakes. And my 18 mo just shared from my plate. I will say that they do offer a ton of food well worth the $10+ plate price. Little tasted pretty good cook corned beef hash was a little bland for my liking. Service was good enough. The tables are not set up well it is hard to maneuver especially when it's busy.  There were a few table side issues that I normally just move on from, there were fruit flied all over our table... it was a battle while we ate but  this is a thing when you have food so I usually don't write anything when th is happens however it may lead into why I rate this a 1 star. The other thing is they don't grow in their strawberries and one of my strawberries had spider web or possibly just a dandelion fuzz either way I just question over to the side of my plate and ignored it. Again I'm usually not picky with natural imperfection its food  it grows outside, whatever. The coffee was okay but I like strong coffee nobody else at the table was impressed by the coffee. So we ate we paid we walked to her car.  Here is the reason for 1 star review* details not for squeamish  My in-laws do not live with us and we haven't seen them for over a week so all of the following  directly relates to our dinning experience. . My mother in law was already starting to not feel so great. We drove home and she was sick (headache, stomach aches). She rode with me and my husband and sister in law went out to go shopping. My mother in law experienced diarrhea the moment we got home. Being Saturday I had errands to run so I left to go run my errands while out my stomach began to hurt pretty bad and I came home, to experience the same diarrhea. My son also came down with headache/ diarrhea.  My husband returned from his shopping early because both him and his sister were not feeling great. The baby also came down with the same illness.  This is a classic food born illness. I'm not sure if this was just a bad day or if other people have experienced the same thing but when an entire family gets sick I feel like it's important to write a review so that other people might be wary. We won't be returning to this restaurant. Eat with caution.",

Even common sense would indicate that these orphaned pancakes had a family somewhere else. It took 45 min to get 3/4 of our table's order out; About 60 min for the 4th. Zero recognition of the service delays. None of the sides like bread or salsa came out at all. No coffee refills. She did ask three times and we kept telling her, but they never came. Oh, this was funny; the waitress told one of our party that he \"could not get bacon\" with his order.  So, he was like, really?..... ok. No bacon. Also, why even ask what size juice? They all came out the same size. We had to wait another 20 minutes after it took an hour to get our food to get the cc back to sign.  We are a pretty mellow group and fortunately, we'll eat again. So, it's not that big of a deal. But I kinda feel like they actually hate running a restaurant and having customers. They really just wanted to design a restaurant and menu.",

Colorful open dinning area with open kitchen is inviting and fun. The only reason it didn't  get 5 stars is because it's hard to get a refill on coffee, I've had to get up and get it myself from a carafe, it'd be great if they could just leave a carafe on the table.",

    "text": "Eggstacy has Officially Jumped the Shark.  I can only hope the leadership cares enough to read each and every word of this review.  So I was a BIG fan of Eggstacy in the early months but the last five times I have visited, the service, food and ambiance have imploded.  I mourn for the loss of yet another Phoenix restaurant.  I don't know the inner dynamics of what has gone so horribly wrong at this place but just watch the interplay at the open kitchen window between the expediter and wait staff and you can witness that all cylinders are misfiring.  The wait staff is victim to the kitchen fails and the kitchen is getting flooded with a failure of the front to professionally manage pacing, menu descriptions and simple bussing of tables.    But you, reader, want details so let's organize and paint the picture from tip to tail.  Reception stand: Somehow the restaurant industry has managed to carve a special place for pretty young girls with little capacity for common sense.  The front desk has become something to suffer rather than welcome.  This last visit was for my wife's birthday breakfast.  We made a reservation for 8 one week in advance.  The weather unexpectedly turned cold, so I called in two hours ahead to inquire if we could ensure an inside table.  The desk could not find the reservation at first and later revealed that they kept a separate book for reservations and walk ins.  With the reservation now found, they were accommodating on the phone.  We arrive 10 minutes early and checked in at the desk.  I could recognize the bubbly voice of the gal at the desk from the phone...and again she cannot locate the reservation...until I ask if it may be in the reservation book.  At least the table was set and ready.  Other people, however, were visibly upset by the desk.  It is set just inside the main entrance and creates a choke point.  The is no civility in the mob rush of the desk and this crowd mismanagement further impedes the ability of patrons finished with their meal to exit.  Additionally, During a lull I asked the hostess how they s at the tables and her answer was simple, \"We just seat the next group once the table is set.\"  But when I asked if they consider the load upon the servers in seating 2-3 tables in a section all at once, she replied that she didn't understand what I was asking.  I am sure there's an app that could remedy this.  Ambiance: Just read the better reviews and you can tell the public is keenly aware this place is just too loud.  The decibels rival pit row at a NASCAR event.  Even at the end of my last visit when I was talking to the manager table side, I found that both she and I were yelling at each other just to be heard three feet away.  Perhaps the interior designer is a retired rock star or jackhammer operator with major hearing loss.  The tile floors, arabesque tile walls, steel beam ceiling and total absence of soft structures is simply dumb.  To the owners, spend a little coin on some heavy drapes to frame the Windows, baffle the ceilings and  you will immediately change the decibels to a pleasant range whereby patrons could leave feeling good about the conversation and the food.  At the Table: Be leery of ordering drinks ahead of your meal.  The staff routinely greets you promptly but once that drink order is in, you typically loose sight of your server for 5-10min.  On this last visit, four hot chocolates, one coffee, one latte and two mimosas took 15 min to deliver.  Made worse, the hot chocolate was missing the \"hot\" and the coffee was bitter or burned.  The second cup of coffee (30min later when the waitress finally brought a pot around for refills) was worse.  Also, a simple tip to all those wait staff out there: if you are filling a cup, leave enough room for your diner to add cream or sugar to their liking.  Nobody wants a piping hot cup filled to the rim spilling on the table before they can make it the way they like it.  Move on to ordering.  Nobody should be set free on the public if they don't know the menu.  For at least six months, many of the items on the menu are described one way but now churned out of the kitchen in that manner.  This happens from time to time but it is the waiter's responsibility to represent those changes.  Once upon a time Eggstacy served a pretzel bun croque madame...that is still inaccurately haunting the menu.  For the last six months, they have been \"out\" of the pretzel buns yet they continue to appear amazed the kitchen serves this flavorless bechemel-drenched mess over flavorless brioche.  So the \"Food\": Mehh....perhaps they have changed suppliers or the original owners turn keyed their restaurant to a soulless corporation riding a wave of popularity, no longer resembling quality.  With eight people at the table, statistically they couldn't ALL be terrible...could they?  1.  The Rueben -  I am certain that a Reuben has corned beef and sauerkraut typically on rye.  The meat that was served contains approximately 10% of the fla",

We were expecting to wait for 45 minutes but were seated immediately at a large table that had opened up. The place is open and loud but the vibe is great and energetic.    Now for the food. I have 3 tween boys and they can pack away a lot of food. It is a rare event that a doggy bag is required however this was the exception. The portions are large and filling. The quality of the food we sampled was excellent and without exception. The kitchen staff knows there stuff and can prepare items beyond the standard breakfast fare. Kudos to the protein pancakes for the low carb/gluten free crowd, they were delicious.  I could keeping going on about the food but I suspect every item is delicious and we will be definitely returning to sample more fare.

    "text": "I'll admit I was a little skeptical of trying brunch at a restaurant with a name like \"eggstasy\"- it just sounded kind of cheesy. At the same time, the pun of the name sucked me in and we had to try it!   The challenge of weekend brunch is always finding a place to go that doesn't have a 45 min wait. I was pleasantly surprised that we only had a 10 min wait on a Sunday around 9:30/10.   The ambiance is trendy with a bright, semi industrial and loft like feel. There's a white tiled wall that gives the entire place a clean, fresh feeling. The light fixtures are modern and inviting. The layout is spacious. It's a bit loud with the hustle and bustle of servers and people but not uncomfortable.   The menu! That is what impressed me the most. The sheer variety and unusual options make it worth coming here. The portions are huge also! My hubs and I could easily share a plate and be satisfied but we usually opt to try two and share for the variety and take the rest home.    Of the two times I've been, I really enjoyed the brie, apple, and chicken sausage omelette. I've also had a savory crepe which was delicious! Like the rest of their menu, the crepe section is extensive.   They serve Lavazza coffee and offer to-go cups- such a bonus.   For me, the value is definitely here for breakfast/brunch. The prices are comparable to other brunch places except their menu is much more interesting.",

    "text": "The service made our experience an agonizing headache.  I sat down at our outdoor table before my husband came in with our son. From our young, inexperienced server, I ordered our two mimosas, a strawberry pomegranate juice in a kids cup, and a kids scrambled egg breakfast with sausage and hash browns. Once they came in, we settled in and enjoyed the open patio on the Sunday morning. The kids drink came out (no mimosas yet) and it was a very thick juice, so I diluted with some water and my son couldn't get enough of it! I then ordered eggs over medium with extra crispy bacon and my husband asked for the Incredible omelette with no mushroom and extra crispy hash browns. The server wrote everything down and even repeated a bit of it back to us.  This is where it started getting annoying.  - Kid's breakfast came out with bacon. Was sent back for sausage. - Had to ask for silverware. - Asked for straws for our waters and an extra napkin, which was thrown on the table. - Asked two extra times about the location of our mimosas. - Hash browns were not crispy, as requested. - (omelette actually had no mushrooms, so small victory) - Bacon was soggy.  By the time we got to my bacon, I was pretty much through with this place, but my son had eggs, which are his favorite, so we weren't going anywhere. I sent back my plate for the chef to get my bacon to extra crispy and then.............................. it never came back. My husband didn't touch his gigantic plate of omelette (that thing's seriously huge. split that shit) because he's a gentleman who waits for everyone to get their meal. Our server uncomfortably sees I still don't have my plate and makes a beeline inside. We notice him continuing to help other tables, so we just wait. He sees our table again, stops and says he'll go check on my bacon. When he comes back out, he looks a little frantic, saying that my plate must have gone out to the wrong table. So I ask for the manager.   The manager comes and asks us how our meal is. We explain that I don't have my meal and that my husband hasn't even tried his yet. We tell her about our wait for mimosas (which ended up coming out about when we got our food) and all other issues which led to this moment. Not saying anything to us, she turns her head and calls out to the server to begin asking him if this is True. She walks him inside. Uh, what? I thought this was going to be a conversation between us and you. I am but a human being - I need closure! And THEN you do your managerial thing in your professional way to a server who doesn't know what he's doing because this is a learning experience. But, no. When my husband walked up to her to ask what was going on, I chugged my mimosa and asked the server for our tab for only the mimosas and the kids meal. He tried to explain to me his actions in a very unprofessional way (it's really busy, it's Saturday, you didn't tell me you wanted mimosas, you never said the bacon needed to be extra crispy!) until he finally left, effectively making me very uncomfortable. When the the server finally came back out, he told us to \"just go\" and that he's getting chewed out by his manager now, so thanks. No, kid. Thank YOU for this experience.   As we were gathering our things, the manager came back out and turned into the woman that I'd hoped she'd be from the get-go. Apologetic, understanding, and caring. She even handed my husband an envelope, saying she would really like us to come back and try them again. Maybe, he tersely replied.  When we got to the car, he opened the envelope. A $10 gift certificate. For wasting my time and a beautiful Sunday morning?? What a joke. We gave it to a waiting couple and will never ever come back.",

Avoid the couches on the patio if the sun is out, they are plastic and get very hot very quickly.  I'll keep the rest short, server did not bring enough water for the table and offered no refills, splashed mimosa on my husband and didn't bother to help clean up or apologize, and we only saw him 3 times the entire meal. Crispy pancakes were burnt, salmon eggs Benny ; salty. Skinny bit*h burrito was bland. chocolate covered bacon had too much chocolate. side of bacon was not \"thick cut\" and was similar to Denny's bacon. all around just disappointing.   won't be back that's for sure.",

    "text": "This place needs to hire people who actually have serving experience, instead of confused hipsters who match the decor. The servers, the food runners, the bussers, it's like no one has EVER worked in a restaurant before. They all run into each other, there's NO \"behind you,\" \"on your left\", there's no helping each other out, they have NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE DOING. They disappear for long stretches of time, they lie to their tables, they are just completely incompetent.   Never, ever going back to Eggstacy. The food is amazing but the service is ATROCIOUS. Two weekends in a row, our server (a different person each time) disappeared for 15-20 minutes. Last time he disappeared right before our food came out, and I had to wait 10 minutes for him to reappear so I could send back my omelette to get it with no mushrooms...the way I ordered it to begin with. Ok, no biggie, stuff happens, but the food is so, SO good I'm definitely going to give it another shot.  The second time, she just didn't even put our order in before she disappeared. First she didn't put our appetizer order in, then she took our main order and didn't put THAT in either! So we sit there, for OVER 40 MINUTES, as tables get sat around us, order from their server (not ours, we didn't see her at all for 20 minutes), GET THEIR FOOD, and eat all of it, and STILL WE DON'T HAVE OUR APPETIZER.   Then she comes rushing over to \"double check\" what we ordered and she flat out lied about forgetting to put our order in, and that's what pisses me off the most. People screw up, fine, but OWN IT and APOLOGIZE. We're not stupid. She finally admitted it, and of course my eggs were undercooked because the kitchen had to rush the entire order. UGH.   Never, ever again. Two visits, two instances of terrible service. Done.",

Didn't matter too much though since the meal was only luke-warm by the time it made it to the table anyway.  The owner came over and asked how things were and my wife said \"disappointing,\" then she left and never came back.

Best breakfast/brunch spot in Scottsdale area for sure. Thanks again David!",

The restaurant is full of light and is fun enough to enjoy with friends while also chill enough to read a book.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about writing this review as this is one of my favorite breakfast places but I'm just tired of having bad experiences here.  It seems every time I come, they are short staffed, the kitchen is backed up etc. Every. Time.  I get it, things happen, servers call in sick, a flood of orders hits the kitchen all at once but unfortunately this has become so consistent that it is no longer the exception it should be.  I do think the servers work hard and are as attentive as they can be but they always have too many tables and we have to flag people down most of the time.  I do love the food and have no complaints about it.  The savory crepes, various pancakes and what my kids call \"foo-foo\" omelets are all divine.  If you have time to spend and are not in a hurry, you just MAY have an enjoyable meal. (I hope you do!)   Just be prepared.  Be prepared to wait. Wait for a table. Then wait to be acknowledged. Then wait an extraordinary long time for your food. (Make sure you get what you need when they bring it too b/c you may not see anyone for a while after that).    For a while I just dealt with it b/c I like the food so much but I don't think I can do it anymore.  There are plenty of other breakfast spots with better, more consistent service.  Sorry Eggstacy, I'm sad to have to go.  I give them a 5 for food but 2 for service.",

Not only was she slamming plates down, she was cussing at her employees so loud that we could hear her. I felt so bad for the employees because they were flustered and trying to move quickly. When we asked who the manager was we spoke to a lady who is the owners daughter. When we told her about the situation that we had young kids with us and that we couldn't believe how the kitchen manager was acting, her response was ridiculous. She said and I quote \"Do you know how hard it is to find good help?\" She said she would speak to the kitchen manager later because she would probably quit on her. She also said that the kitchen manager needs to keep them in line when it's busy. I explained that I understand keeping the employees in line but cussing at them was absolutely uncalled for and unprofessional. The food was good but we didn't pay to have such a horrible experience.",

We walked in and thought great we're gonna have to wait cause there was so many people waiting. Luckily, it was me and my wife and they seated us right away. What a relief.   The place very bright with bright yellow and green bring color to the room with cool light fixtures. Very welcoming and warm but really busy and loud.   Anyways, I ordered the Lemon Blueberry French Toast with a side of homemade Hash Browns. I got three huge pieces of French toast with fresh blueberries sprinkled around with fresh whip cream, strawberry, butter and syrup. First bite and wow. Loved it. It had the lemon flavor with blueberries inside the French toast. Really tasty and thick. The homemade hash browns did not disappoint. Really good and crispy the way I like it. I'm a pretty big eater and I could barely finish it. Portions are huge.   My wife got the two egg breakfast with hash browns and pancakes. She loved it and was talking about it on the way home. That doesn't happen too often. She loved the crispy hash browns but was crazy about the pancakes. She thought the pancakes were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Cooked just right. She thought the pancakes had a different taste than all the others ones she had before.   The service I thought was good. Our waiter poured glasses of water and they leave a pitcher of water with ice & cucumber in it. Out waiter kept an eye on us and took away our finished plates very quickly. One thing that impressed me was how quickly then can clean a table up. One person cleans, one person sets the table, and one person sweeps up for those messy people.   I thought this was a really fun place to eat. Very lively. Huge portions. Good food. What else could I ask for breakfast. Enjoy.",

The food came out all wrong and the server didn't even have a pen to sign the check. Not one pen? Ok guess you don't want a tip? The owner's mother (not the manager mind you) argued instead of trying to make things better or fix the problem. My order took 1 hr and 30 min and it was incorrect once it came. I'm extremely disappointed. I am not one to complain because I understand the food industry as I have worked and managed multiple restaurants. However, this has been the worst possible experience for breakfast and I promise you that you will feel the same. If I could give less than zero stars, I would.",

The restaurant is an open concept layout, so, do expect some noise and bustle around you while you dine. Everything is in view. I was greeted shortly after I walked in and was nearly immediately seated, the place was very busy, so, I'm impressed with the short/non-existence wait time. Once seated, it was only a matter of moments before my waiter Kayden appeared and took my drink order, impressed again. When he came back, he asked if I had anything in mind for breakfast, awesome, because when he asked that particular question, he was actually looking for a discussion of my preferences. He listened to my answer and asked a few follow ups to make absolutely sure he got it right, he made a few suggestions like \"you should try our sausage patties\", Ok... Maple Sausage Patties made in house, absolutely delicious, a must have. The turnaround time on the order was super fast and everything was exactly as I ordered. Kayden kept breezing by from time to time to check up on me and refill coffee, no pressure, very attentive, and when I asked for something, he went right to it and didn't get distracted and forget, impressed again. After a short while, Kayden brought the check and set it on the table, long before I was ready to leave, awesome, now I don't have to flag him down and wait for it, impressed again. Looking around, you see the wait staff, when they aren't at tables serving their customers, they are lined up at the kitchen anxiously awaiting their food to come out, again, absolutely awesome, the food doesn't sit there getting cold waiting for your server to get around to picking it up. When the couple at the table next to me were finished, the guy that busses the table was there within a very short time as he cleaned, he asked if I needed anything or a to go box, so, this tells me that he has customer service skills as well and wants to make sure I'm being taken care of.  All in all, great experience, well taken care of delicious food made correctly to your order, I will be back.  The only negative is the restrooms, they need some help. My breakfast came to $16 not including tip, a little on the upper end, but for the quality of the food and the portion size, I think it's within reason.",

Some things I noticed when going to Eggstasy is that there are many options to choose from on the menu. This is both a blessing and a curse. If you are someone who can't decide what to get, good luck. But if you are someone that loves to experiment with different food, then this is a great place for you. The food there was overall well put together, put their portions are a large, so do not over order or you will regret it. The food there is a little pricey. $5.50 for a coffee and 15$ for an omelet is a little high. The high prices do make sense though because of the large portions and numerous sides that come with the meal. I recommend the restaurant to decrease the size of their dishes and make sides extra to minimize cost. Also, the service at this restaurant was subpar. My friends order got mixed up and had to ask for ketchup multiple times before receiving it. A plus I would give this restaurant is that the food comes out very fast ( not many people were there when I went). Overall great breakfast but a little pricey.",

It feels like a different restaurant because of the size but it's the same great food and same fun vibe. The staff is great and I will definitely be coming back on the regular to see them.  Come in twice a week till you've tried the entire menu,  i promise you'll be glad you did.",

By the time we were sat the first table had ordered. We were ready to order right when we sat but when I told the waiter he said \"I got you\" and then walked away. He came back around and we told him again but he still didn't take our order. When he finally got our order we waited 30 minutes and then told him we had a hotel checkout in an hour and might need everything packed up and brought with the check. We waited another half hour and still no food so the group of two said they would bring the food back and pay the checks, they checked with the hostess how much longer it would be and she told them the kitchen was backed up. They stopped the waiter and let him know to bring the food to her since we had to run back to the hotel. When we got back to the hotel we were told that the hostess saw us leave and went to the kitchen and cancelled the order and when they tried to reorder everything they would not make the food. After an hour of sitting there..... No food...",

I remember different textures and warm colors (or was there just a yellow wall?) from my last visit. I like the high ceiling that made the space look more open.   My wife and I both enjoyed our food. I ordered corned beef hash, like I always do from brunch menus, and she had chocolate chip waffles with crispy prosciutto. Hers came with a side of fresh fruits and everything on her plate was delicious. Mine was good too, but it wasn't great. My poached eggs came out hard. I guess I should've specified but I'm just used to getting them soft with a runny yolk. The meat was a bit dry but I ate it with Tabasco anyway. I was satisfied but I've had better corned beef hash. We also ordered fresh strawberry oj, which tasted fresh but wish it was served cold.   Staff was friendly and the wait for the food was pretty quick. We left satisfied and I would definitely go back to try other dishes.",

Nom-nom deliciousness!  I had the Berry Blintz. Omygoddess, had a li'l foodgasm with the first bite.

It's not easy to mess up brunch, but my table of 4 - none of us really enjoyed what we ordered. It wasn't horribly bad, but it wasn't satisfying. I stopped eating my Benedict after the first one and just left it there. I didn't even want to take it home.   The pancakes were weird. When I cut into it, it was breaking apart. Almost as if the texture was hard and crunchy? Not pancake like at all.   Also this place has the most expensive orange juice ever. My friend ordered a large orange juice (with no free refills) for $5.50. How outrageous is that?",

We started with the lemon blueberry French toast (which everyone should try), I'd recommend it to share not as a dish just for you unless you're really craving something on the sweeter side. Then I got the Eggasm - and I've been craving it for the past 3 days. It's listed as an appetizer but if you share the French toast like we did it's perfect as an entree. The omelettes are huge and there is a really nice selection of Benedicts to choose from.   TL;DR: get the eggasm and the lemon blueberry French toast and thank me later.",

Hash browns are homemade and top notch.  My wife got the Melt Away and it was equally delicious. The veggies were really good.  Orange juice is fresh squeezed and tastes like heaven.  I cannot recommend enough.",

I knew the owners were Greek so I went with Greek Skillet which was fantastic. I had a side of gluten free lemon pancakes that could have easily been their own meal. My daughter had what was on menu as  chocolate chip pancake (as in singular) but there were 3 gigantic pancakes on plate. My son ordered Dali skillet, which was spicy and, also huge. Also appreciated the AC wasn't on full blast which is an AZ thing I can't stand.",

Another order a quinoa bowl and the iced coffee which is real good. It's a bit pricey for breakfast, but it's unique enough place that they can get away with it, I suppose. We sat outside, because inside was very loud and we had the baby with us. It was nice but when the sun came out it got HOT. The booths make you sweat and your legs and back stick to the seats. They have umbrellas that don't cover enough and no misters or fans, so I'm not sure how they manage during the summer. I will definitely go back. It's a great place to take out of town visitors.",

To me, this place is OK, I can't say I was impressed with the food.  The ambiance  was nice though, it was well decorated and had a lively atmosphere.  The service was good and they constantly fill up your water and coffee.  The place had a diverse menu alot of variety.  As you may know, I'm not a sweets person and not a huge fan of waffles, pancakes, or crepes, which this place is know for.  I'm more of a biscuits and gravy guy or meals that are hearty.  I ordered the brisket and gravy, but was eventually told they ran out of brisket, so I went with the standard biscuits and gravy and two eggs.  I also ordered the chrizo  cheddar grits.  The biscuits were whole and had gravy on top.  It didnt have enough gravy for the whole dish.  I felt the dish was very dry and bland.  The cheddar grits were nothing to rave about either and for the price, the portions were small.   If you ask my fiancee she would give this place 5 stars.  She's into the fancy fresh juices and presentation.  I'm all about the food.  I was told they have big portions, but it was nothing to rave about.  I did see an omelette dish the person ordered next to us, it did look good.  Anyways, I'm always open to try out breakfast joints, but I dont think I would go back to this place again...Who am I kidding..my lady loves this place, I'm sure I'll be back and hopefully will try something better and give it a better review.",

The food is ok most of the time, but a couple of times I had horrible eggs. As in not edible.   I've never had a five star experience here, with either food nor service. Mostly disappointing. But worth three   But alas, in the name of saving time, in a rush to get breakfast on the way out of town, I recently went back.   BUT....This last time I visited they seemed to have better knowledgeable staff that knew what they were doing!! Amazingly different than before!   My order was correct! as in I got the meal I ordered(most of time there are mistakes)   My eggs came out over medium just like I ordered! (NEVER  happened before in approx 5previous visits)   The waitress checked on us throughout the meal!  Again, this is new.   I was delighted at the transformation they seem to be doing.  The place seemed cleaner. The staff is different & more professional.  Good job on the improvements.  Thanks eggstasy I will try again, and hopefully have better experiences. I'm actually rooting for you!  The 'better quality breakfast business competition is actually very nearby, one across the street and one about two miles away, but with this  being walking distance from me, is why I hope for eggstasy, to get it together.   If they would just play appropriate, less jarring music, it would be a more comfortable place to eat. And I'd be less inclined to drive for my morning meals.",

    "text": "Food was really good overall, a few things better than others. Omelet was awesome and my girlfriend liked her benedict. It seemed like a lot of people were working there but the service didn't reflect it. We had someone come by for a drink order, then another person came by for out meal order. Had what was called \"the incredible omelet\" and it was... pretty darn incredible. Ordered the hash browns and they brought me fruit. They offered to bring out hash browns as an extra side, which is so much better than places that pull the dish back and correct it. After getting the whole order, the fruit would have been a better choice, but hash browns are... well hash browns no matter where you go. The fruit was a skewer of pineapple and berries, which was really unique compared to a bowl of fruit. I ordered a bloody mary, girlfriend ordered a strawberry mimosa which was recommended by the waiter. When the bloody mary came out, I had to take a moment to say \"wow\". Saying it was garnished would be an understatement, as there were the usual celery and lemon, but an added skewer of olives and two kinds of bell pepper (did I mention they must own a skewer business?) across it. I saw in other reviews that there was chocolate dipped bacon with this drink, and there was indeed... chocolate on bacon. It was an interesting add-on, but not one that really worked for me. Some may like that, but I was kind of \"ehh\". The bloody mary was more of a jalapeno taste that horseradish, not really anything unique. Girlfriend's mimosa was good, not great. The \"strawberry reduction\" was more like strawberry syrup, and it was not exactly a big glass to start with. Decent pour on champagne, OJ tasted fresh squeezed. The funny thing is the brunch type drinks aren't anywhere on the menu, so you kind of have this \"well what do you have for adult drinks\" moment with the waiter. Even more shocking is the price when the bill comes. Would not order them again for the $8 and $10 each. Other places offer a better drink for the same or less. I don't mind a $45 breakfast for two, but it usually means more drinks at that price. The place is bright and open, the atmosphere was really inviting. As mentioned in the other reviews, there were a few flies, but nothing that made me wince (we sat inside but the doors were rolled up and the patio was 20 feet away). The real disappointment was the service. Our waiter was working several tables, and it didn't seem like he had a busser as a backup for him. Ice tea glasses sat empty for long periods, plates that were empty sat for a while too. There had to be nearly as many people working as there were customers, but it didn't look like people were doing much. I am not sure if there was a 'manager' working, there were a few people who looked like they could have been something other than waitstaff, but we never had anyone ask if things were ok with a table-touch, which would have been nice. Our waiter looked like he was really busy, so cannot fault him, but since we had encountered 4 people from the time we walked in (host, drink gal, waiter, guy who brought plates out, same waiter again for check) a busser would have really been called for and it seemed they had them to spare. I would have gone to 4 stars had the service been there, but don't see me going back. Someone asked me later \"have you been to any new breakfast places lately that you recommend\" and my answer unfortunately was \"not really\". Good food, 'meh' drinks, kinda poor service means no repeat.",

The service is very friendly and the servers seem to know their menu. The food is simply unbelievable. I couldn't ask for a better breakfast anywhere else.   The owner (possibly manager) greeted my friend and I and after discovering it was our first experience at the restaurant he brought us little samples of crepes. I wouldn't ever order crepes on my own but after trying these my mind was blown! I don't remember the name but I'm pretty sure they were banana and Nutella. My favorite part of the meal had to be the teas though. To say the food was amazing is one thing, but this little place was on point with everything, even that delicious tea!  I can't wait to go back to Eggstacy for another amazing breakfast and experience!",

    "text": "OMG!!! I think I am still full from Sunday Brunch last week! From the street you dont even notice this amazing Gem off of Shea! Its a must visit but get there early as they get a long waiting list early. We were a party of 3 and found a seat at the bar. Don't know how the service was but seemed a bit slim.  TIP!!!!!!-- The bar is all open seating, if its a small group, place your name on the list and go stand by the bar for people to leave, turns a 1.5 hour wait into a 15 minute wait.   For their food.. Watch out for the portions, they are massive, Had the corn beef hash and eggs, I dont know how I finished it but it was massive. The pancakes are the fluffiest ive ever had. We defined them as ..... Fluff-tastic !! Yes we made up a word because they were so good.   On top of that, you have to try the chocolate covered bacon. Its a must!  Down side, no drink specials and nothing too fancy, its all about the food not the drinks  When I feel like I can eat that much again, im going back but will make sure to workout all week leading up to it.   A must try!",

The restaurant was really apologetic.  The chocolate covered bacon was also a miss.  First time our family hasn't finished an order of bacon.  It was cold and soggy.  Will definitely give it another try bc service and effort on behalf of the staff were great but it will probably not ever be on my go-to list.",

    "text": "I'm new to Scottsdale and I decided to venture out for breakfast one morning. This place is pretty close to home and I thought I would check it out.   My first impression - this place is LOUD. The acoustics in this place make general conversation by diners echo and it sounds like a high school cafeteria in there. I could barely hear my server. So, if you're looking for a quiet breakfast, this won't be the place for you.  I must have just missed the main breakfast rush, because the place was full, but I only had to wait a few minutes for a table.   Bonus points - the regular coffee is really quite good.  If the coffee was that good, I was very excited for my meal.  I ordered the Steak and Eggs Benedict which came with hash browns or fruit (I chose hash browns) and I also ordered a side of the Chorizo Cheesy Grits, because I was curious.  I requested the steak be cooked medium.  My food arrived fairly quickly, and it was almost perfect.  The steak was juicy and flavourful, the eggs were poached perfectly, the sauce was delicious. My only slight complaint was the English Muffin was a little under toasted, so it tasted a little gummy. The hash browns had a slight hint of heat to them, which made them fantastic.  The Cheesy Grits were fine, but not what I was hoping for.  I wouldn't order those again.  There were so many menu options that I deciding what I wanted to eat was a challenge.  I will definitely be back to sample more of their options.",

    "text": "Start to finish: Arriving the place seemed PACKED. asked the hostess to put our name in  (4 people) and she said it was going to be 45 minutes. Walked around to the bar which was also packed and got some mimosas. Then we started looking around. All though the place seemed packed, only about  1/2 their tables were occupied. We soon found out the reason: owner and/or manager was this old mean lady who was incredibly rude to both customers and wait staff.  Finally a waiter snuck us into an empty table in his section after seeing us standing at the bar for 30 minutes. Manager/owner then proceeded to come over and yell at him in front of all the diners. Despite her actions the waiter held his ground and we were able to keep our table.  Our waiter was awesome! he totally took care of everything we wanted, kept our waters full, joked around with us about, gave us some great advice about where to visit, and talked us through the whole menu. He even brought a sample of the chocolate bacon for us to try! This is what we had: Bloddy Marry- Loved the veggies and chocolate cover bacon that came with this. However the mixer seemed a little thin and tasteless to me. All in all 4 stars Pumpkin Cheesecake Pancakes-Not enough Pumpkin flavor for us personally, but they were still great. Eat these fast! 4 stars Caprese Benedict-Egg was poached perfectly and the pesto tasted amazing. 5 stars Breakfast Burger-Fried leeks were amazing but the burger meat itself needed more flavoring. 5 stars Dutch Apple French Toast-Apples were cooked perfectly and the cinnamon butter was to die for. 5 stars Prosciutto & Chocolate Chip Waffles-Super yummy, but it was bacon not prosciutto served with it. 5 stars  All in all we will definitely be coming back here because of the food and the wait staff. Hopefully the manager/owner will start to understand she needs to work behind the scenes a bit more.",

Our waiter started out great:  brought us waters, got our coffee, took our order, pleasant and courtesy.  Then after he served us, he came back for our obligatory \"how's everything?\" and DISAPPEARED!!!  We flagged down another waitress who re-filled our cups, got a box for my leftovers and she apologized saying she didn't know where our server had gone. About 10 minutes later we were ready to leave and STILL never saw our server!  Hated to do it but flagged down the nice waitress who had helped us before and asked if she could find our bill.  She did and apologized again, but we never saw the original waiter again.  Lucky the food was good.",

By the time they got their food, we were completely finished.  Our waitress, Erin apologized.  We asked to speak to the manager and waited another 15 minutes.  We finally went up to the manager who seemed very inexperienced and who was too busy to bother with us and explained our complaint.  We told her we were not paying for any of our breakfasts which she agreed to comp.

But it went downhill from there.  It took 20 minutes to get water after asking twice.  Got water, took drink and food order.  Water had fruit flies in it.  Not just in my glass, but in the water carafe.  I would have told someone, but there was nobody to tell.  Never got refills on drinks, food came out one at a time.  My husband's omlette, then, my salad, then my grandson's crepes and my husband's side of pancake.    What was suppose to come out warm was cold and what suppose to be chilled was warm and wilted.  The pancakes could have been used as a flying saucers.  It was so thick and dense, it clunked on the plate.  Very, very disappointing.

The menu has lots of great sounding options and they have a good variety of freshly squeezed juices. The food was incredible!

Our first visit didn't go so well because we were confused that a pancake would come as a side for an already large meal and there was just overall miscommunication.  We have been back twice since and have enjoyed both of the other visits.  Good mimosas, good breakfast and an assortment of things to choose from.  It's great because my mother-in-law can get something super healthy and my father-in-law can get his not-so-healthy choices.  I love the avocado benedict but also enjoy the skinny b as well.  Cute decor. The inside can be really noisy.  There's a lot of concrete/tile/metal so noise kind of bounces around. I think it's better when the windows are up on the one side of the bar because the noise has an outlet- but on a day like today when it's 112 and not practical to open the windows, it gets noisy.  Not a huge deal though because the great food makes it worthwhile and normally we sit outside if we can anyway.  Nice breakfast place that we enjoy on occasion.",

They just opened this week so we will call this review \"constructive criticism.\" First off the decor is really nice and clean but yet the staff does match the decor. They all looked VERY sloppy, maybe being new they haven't implemented attire yet? Or a shower for that matter? Sorry they all looked greasy and gross. Service was over the top, almost to much. Couldn't take a full bite without someone interrupting making sure we were okay. Once or twice is good but not every second. Also I like restaurants where you can see the kitchen so I can see the food being prepared, except in this case we were directly facing the kitchen and one guy kept using his hand to wipe his forehead and then was handling the food! Ugh gross!! One out of the 3 chefs touching food was wearing gloves, that reallllllllly bothers me! Gloves should be worn at all times no excuse! Now  to the food, soup was awesome, fries are awesome, but both sandwiches we ordered weren't great. One was the Reuben and we asked what sauce came with it and were told none, then half way through the sandwich we were brought what was suppose to be thousand island and it tasted more like vinegar horseradish. Also the corned beef was not good. Can't remember the name of the other sandwich but couldn't get through that one either. All in all if they clean up in the kitchen (wearing gloves, and not using hands to wipe sweat) I would try this place again seeing the other reviews are good. Gave 3 stars because their new, otherwise would have been 1 or 2.",

    "text": "We waited 40 minutes on Sunday Brunch April 3rd the place was packed. We waited another 20 minutes for anyone to come and allow us to order food. A party of 11 we we're seated outside and they we're nice to put another umbrella for our group. EVERYONE was very nice but the service was not great. The chairs stunk like heated plastic and was dirty. To be expected being outdoors I guess. We ordered our food and we got it over 30 minutes later, and they kept trying to convince our party that we ordered an egg Benedict even though we didn't. They forgot an order my daughter waited another 30 minutes. THE FOOD WAS GREAT THOUGH! We all enjoyed our order. A lot of food for the price!  We got our water, and utencils after are food too!  we were at eggstacy for over 2 hours. We thought it was just our group being big. BUT THE PARTY OF 3 BY US HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. Even with all the problems we had, I think it was worth the wait. When it was time to leave and pay they also sneaked in an order we didnt make ( yes the egg benedict!) Thank you to everyone. Next time we will avoid Sunday! Maybe things will be better. Have recommended to many already. TASTE WAY BETTER THAN BUTTERFIELDS. BTW.",

The chocolate covered bacon and the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes were to die for! If you are in the neighborhood, I highly recommend stopping in for some delicious breakfast and/or lunch. I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu items. If it's as good as the first time around, this may be my new favorite spot. Oh, and if you appreciate fresh squeezed juice - you will love theirs! Great service, great ambiance and great food!",

    "text": "Just had lunch. Our first time here. Come hungry because the portions are very generous! Lunch for me was the camelback panini which came with excellent fries and an unexpected treat of a bowl of their freshly made soup! My wife had blueberry filled pancakes (4 large) which she said were very good. She brought two home. Other then a few start up training things which we really did not notice I would say this place is a home run for the owners. Great service, great food, great staff and reasonably priced! We will be back soon.",

A member in our party mis-ordered, his fault, and they were so willing to correct it and then follow up to be sure he was happy with his meal.  Couldn't ask for better service.  The only negative is the noise level but that won't deter us from returning.",

Both times it took our server 20 min to even take a drink order, the second time after we asked the hostess to see a server! I ordered two drinks at a time for fear I wouldn't see another server again. What a shame to have such excellent food be ruined by such awful service! None of us will go back again!!",

My girlfriend ordered the eggs, corned beef hash, and pancakes while I decided to go all out with the Dutch Apple French Toast with a side of chocolate covered bacon. Let me first say that the strawberry mimosa and fresh squeezed orange juice were just incredible but back to the main event. The beautiful presentation of a half chocolate covered piece of crispy bacon with chocolate drizzle, whipped cream and strawberry was a great start. And then the French toast arrived...Thick French toast covered in caramel, sauteed apples, and graham cracker crumbles, best French toast this side of France, if they even make French toast over there. More food than we could reasonably handle but it won't deter us from returning again. Next time, crispy pancakes...in the eternal words of Arnold Shwarzeneggar, who is not French, I'll be back.",

Delicious and presentation was five star. Restaurant has an urban modern vibe, and is noisy BUT they are addressing this with plans to add fabric to ceiling, etc.   patio is being remodeled and glass garage door will be open soon to add fresh air to restaurant.  Bar area for dining is nice touch.  Looking forward to going back....we will be regulars",
