The beef and broccoli was so sweet.. Toward the end I had to stop eating it because it was sickly sweet and felt the same about the dumplings sauce.. (Just as a rule of thumb... Don't put the sauce all over the dumplings on a take out order.. They became soggy) but why so much sugar!? I think you should scale way back, probably by 3/4ths.  Totally not worth the cost of the food.. The only bright spot was the customer service, it was excellent..",

I do appreciate that PF Changs offers gluten-free options, a few of which are also vegetarian. It's just that it's not very good. I ordered the Coconut Curry vegetables, the cucumbers and an overpriced glass of cheap wine, and my friend had the salmon (because the server said it was the most popular dish). She said her entree was bland. Everything I had was underwhelming. And the food just didn't sit right with me. The host was friendly and helpful, but our server wasn't very good.

First when our waitress came she doesn't offer to take our drink order she assumes we just want water I know I have a big family but we're going out for a nice dinner why wouldn't we want drinks or a least ask us if we did I had to pretty much do her job and go around the table asking everyone what they wanted to drink and this went on the whole dinner. I had to flag her down to order appetizers and again for our dinner. We had to ask for the sauces they usually bring before you're dinner And make to your liking she brought in little containers. And to top it off it was my birthday so my husband tried to get her to bring out a special treat for me and she brought out chocolate cake and later my husband told me when we left he kept telling her if there was something else she bring because I don't like chocolate cake but she said all she could do was add some ice cream to it he did said that was fine because he thought like most places that it would be complimentary but no she charged us almost 15$ for something we didn't even want and there were other desserts we could have got since we paid for it anyways but it was just how horrible of a waitress she was and how horrible she made this dinner be. Not sure will be going back ever again. But I will say the food was delish and that is the one star is for.",

Sure their signature chicken lettuce wraps are good, but their salt & pepper calamari are better! If you're a crab wonton fan, their hand-folded crab wontons will do the trick. For my main course, my absolute favorite is their Sesame Chicken under their Wok Classics accompanied by their fried rice! The egg drop soup is also yummy and my favorite side dish is their Shanghai Cucumbers, gotta try those! I prefer to go to the PF Changs by Fashion Square Mall on Camelback, ask for their server Patrick, or you might find him behind the bar, and if you do, order the Coconut Lemon Sour. He's incredibly friendly and very attentive, he also makes great recommendations.",

    "text": "This was my long-overdue first visit to P.F. Chang's and it was very satisfying. Went for lunch on a Friday and it was not very busy at all.  I'll get into the food in a bit, but first I have to applaud Chang's for their amazing service. Not only were they super-attentive and friendly but they helped us out so much. The thing is, my girlfriend is vegetarian and I am vegan so it's often hard to find a decent meal at restaurants that cater primarily to meat-eaters. We let our server know our dietary concerns and he was zipping back and forth to the kitchen (unbidden, mind you!) to find out what all was vegan. Usually when I dine out and ask \"Does this have _____ in it?\" or \"Is this vegan?\" I get an odd look and an unsure \"Yeah...that's totally vegan...\". It's hard to enjoy a meal when you aren't confident that there isn't some sort of strange animals bits lurking in it. You'd have to adhere to understand, but trust me. It sucks when you can't enjoy your food because there is that concern in the back of your mind.  Now on to the food...  We started with the tofu lettuce wraps which I had heard great things about. They were a bit salty for my tastes, but still very good. The addition of a crisp, cool sesame slaw would have taken this dish to the next level, but that's just me.  For the main course I got the coconut curry and my girlfriend got the ma po tofu. The coconut curry had all kinds of colorful vegetables and tofu topped with peanuts. It was alright, but no where near the same quality curry you'd get from Thai Basil or Swadee or Touch of Thai. But that's to be expected. After all, it's not a Thai restaurant.  The ma po tofu was HUGE. Large, sweet and saucy chunks of tofu wreathed in broccoli. Of the three things we tried, this was my favorite.  Oh, and they offer brown rice! Thank goodness because American really needs to get on the Whole Grain Train.  So there you have it. The vegan food is enough for me to *want* to return, but the great service pretty much guarantees that I will. I just hope the Chang's across the street from me in Chandler can match this location! If so, I'd be stunned.  UPDATE: Since posting this review I've visited both the Chandler and Tempe Chan'gs. Of the three Scottsdale is by far the best. Chandler location completely lost my business when they mixed chicken in with my tofu. Unacceptable.",

I also like the pictures of most of their entrees. I've been to this location several times over the years and they are pretty consistent with service and delicious food.   I started out with their Hot & Sour soup which is perfect in my book.  Spicy but not burn your mouth for minutes later spicy. It's rich and velvety and perfectly done. I went back to a good old stand by,  the Orange Peel chicken with white rice.  The chicken was nice white pieces with a tangy, spicy coating that was amazing.  A new dish we had to try was Hokkien Street Noodles, the picture looked great and when it arrived, it looked and smelled heavenly.  I love the thin rice noodles!!  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the light curry sauce was perfect amount to noodles ratio.  I will order this dish again!! I notice they have changed up their menu adding Dim sum which is nice for variety.  Dessert was New York Cheese cake with berries and it was delicious. Great dinner!!  Thanks P.F.

We were seated at around 7:15pm and we got our food at 8:45 the kitchen was ill staffed and the servers were stretched thin. My food tasted as though it had been sitting under a heat lamp for at least 30 mins. and this was the only time I've ever had chicken that didn't taste like chicken.

The other food I ordered was very dry as well and the cup of wonton soup came with 2 tiny wontons. Very disappointed beyond belief.",

Tender pork ribs, marinated for hours, cooked to perfection in a tangy sauce, and served with a little ramekin of Chinese 5-spice blend.  Pinch a little atop -- munch, munch, munch.  It's pure love.  Order \"off the menu\": -- The \"real\" Ginger Beer; usually made with Kirin beer and ginger syrup has been replaced with a non-alcoholic one on the menu.  I have them make it with bud light to save a few calories, and still -- so good. -- The \"Stir-fried Eggplant\" is awesome.  Except they no longer carry it with the minced chicken, only listed with the veggies.  Voila!  Available on request.  Yay!  I took some photos of the ribs and eggplant, and eek - doesn't look so good up-close, so scratch the upload.  Regardless, with the trinity of PF Chang sauces, I slather it all about everything I order...always great.  Like George, I like it HOT and SPICY.  No matter what you order, you get quality -- not authentic, but it is what it is.  Whether you get a Chinese Chicken Salad (adore), Sweet & Sour Soup, or the Lemon Chicken -- it's consistently good.  ======================= Location specific - Scottsdale =======================  1.  Big location, lots of seating, and great outdoor area.  2.  Late night happy hour - yay!  When the temp of the nights in AZ are in the 70's --- sitting outside is supreme  3.  Yelp check-in offer, free order of dim sum - edamame potstickers (yum!)",

As a result, there was sauce all over the bag and the dumplings were drenched in some sauce we did not want.  We called PF changs but they gave us some lame excuse and said it wasn't their fault.  Which is baloney since it is clear that whoever packed the food did a poor job.   This was a bad experience.  I would not order food through them on amazon prime. And, if I did order takeaway from PF Chana's I would check my food before leaving the premises.",

You can buy them in the frozen section!! Not nearly as good as the freshly made ones from the restaurant, but mmm....they are still delightful)  Their lettuce wraps are also amazing. So are the crispy green beans. And their desserts. Oh gosh. This place is just delicious. Now I'm craving it...  I feel like the best thing to do here is just share a bunch of appetizers. I've done that in groups or just on date night, and there is always more than enough.   Pretty large restaurant, easy to find, convenient location. Lot's of parking. There is outdoor seating as well. Kinda dark inside, but that's just kinda the theme of this place; it's rather intimate. Not very loud, which is nice.  The service was mehh. Took awhile for the guy to take our food order. My dad ordered Jack on the rocks and got it neat, took an unusually long time to bring it out correctly. Always had to ask for drink refills, glasses were constantly empty. Never really prebussed the table either, lots of empty plates takes up a lot of space. 5 stars if service was better.",

Tried their prawns with noodle entree for the first time. Much better than the salt & pepper prawns. But still stunningly over salted.   Szechuan beef a standard favorite was inedible. The beef was thin little strings. Cooked beyond death. Tougher than leather. The only flavor was the coating of spice. Giant fail.  The topper was how the server handled things. Now, I'm a really frequent customer so I get a lot of Chang's rewards. It just means I've spent a lot of money on them. So, tonight was a free entree. It doesn't mean they should just pass things off because my tab was going to be lower than normal. I tried repeatedly to let the server know the beef was a disaster. Finally, at the end, when \"to go\" boxes were rejected, I made the comment. It was nearly laughed off. I said, \"the kitchen really let you down on this. They should taste it, it's that bad.\" She had no skills to handle this. No manager was brought in. Nothing. I was not looking for anything to be comp'd. But, management should realize that one reason their dining room is no longer packed like it was years ago has everything to do with a kitchen staff phoning it in and a server who doesn't care at all.  Bummer. This location is right in the middle of my \"I want dinner now\" path frequently.",

    "text": "My family and I love this place, we usually go to the location at Kierland but tonight we branched out, and boy were we sorry.   When we arrived, the restaurant was all but empty, but it still took the host a few to make it to the front to seat us (it was no biggie at the time, but in retrospect, it should have been our first clue). When we were sat it took a while before our server a while to come and take our drink order. He was talkative, vibrant, and wayyyyyy too creative, and spent almost ten minutes talking to another table after we ordered before bringing our waters. It took almost 15 more to get our bar drinks (a beer and a cocktail). We ordered the Changs for two, with this you get a soup, an appetizer and two entrees. Each course took what felt like forever to come out. The appetizers and salad were tasty, but our entrees were a disaster.   Right before our entrees came out, our server (the creative one) came to our table and told my boyfriend \"I made the executive decision to order your Mongolian beef the way I like it best.\" Um..... In what world is it ok to order your favorite for someone else without asking the guest before you order it????????? Not only did my boyfriend HATE it, but his noodles never came, my pad Thai also came without sauce (another executive decision?). By this time we had been in the restaurant for 2 hours, so my boyfriend choked his meal down, and by the time my sauce came my noodles were cold. My food smelled and tasted like a wet dog. Literally.   A manager came by to check on us, and despite not wanting to complain, I asked him to take the soaking mutt disguised as pad Thai away and replace it. He told me he agrees with me and that they put too much fish sauce on the dish now, and he hates when people order it.... Um... Ok?? I ended up complaining about the \"executive decisions\", the timing and the wrong orders. He offered to make me something to go and I agreed and ordered the ginger chicken with noodles instead of rice, he also offered to take care of or check. I told him that our bar drinks were awesome and offered to pay for them. He said, verbatim, \"ok, you buy your drinks, I'll take care of the rest\". We were in no way trying for a free meal, but when a manager offers, they should deliver.   When the check came, we just gave a card to the creative waiter believing that we were only paying for our beverages. When the check came back, the manager had not obliged to his own promise and charged us for half of our food and we had already paid!!!!!!!   When I got home, I began to eat my ginger chicken with noodles and that order, again, was wrong.    Unless you're only going to drink, this location is a waste of time, patience, and money and with so many other options at lower price points, there are many, cheaper options.",

The serves was good most of the time, but our server seemed to just disappear near the end of our time there. But no biggy.  Before I came here I was expecting a lot. I have heard a lot of good things. So, I was excited to go. When I seen the prices of the food, most dishes $15-25,  was thinking, wow thia place must be really good. After all, thats a lot for some Chinese food. However, When I got the food it was of less quality then most Chinese buffets I been to. The crispy honey chicken with honey chicken was soggy and my beef was burnt.  The quality of the food will most likely prevent me from going again unless someone else is willing to dish out for it.  All and all, the it was ok, but not worth the price for sure.",

    "text": "I was taking a course at the Civic Center Library when I received a call from some friends who were in the Phoenix area and asked if they could come over to my house to say hi.  I had nothing in the house to feed them so I decided to drop by PF Chang's and get dinner for the 6 of us.  The hostess told me to go to the bar (behind the hostess station ) toward the right and ask for Jay.  Jay would take my order.  I waited about 10 minutes and no Jay.  Then I overheard a young asian man on the phone saying that he had been there 30 minutes waiting for his food.  I turned around and asked him:  Have you really been waiting 30 minutes for your order?  He said, \"Yeah.  and I called it way ahead of time\".  Knowing that this ridiculous time frame would not work for me and knowing that a dinner order for 6 would take some time if I ever found \"Jay\",  I decided to head for the door.  I stopped at the hostess station to tell her what happened but the \"hostess\" was no where to be found.  I ran into a waitress, explained that I wasn't able to even find this \"Jay\" and that after waiting, I am deciding to leave.  She said, \"OK\",  (no sweat off her back!)  I guess PF Chang doesn't mind losing a take out dinner order for 6 people.    I am a big fan of PF Chang at Kierland in Scottsdale so I am appauled at this lack of service at this location.  Ironically, this location was half empty so I don't understand why the kitchen was so backed up that take out orders were so delayed.  I didn't even get a chance to put in an order because \"Jay\" the elusive, was no where to be found.  Maybe it was a Godsend that Jay wasn't around and that I didn't put it an order.  It might have been hours before I got the order.     I ended up picking up food at my local chinese restaurant where the cost was half as much as PF Chang.     Can I give zero stars?",

Normally my favorite is Chang's Spicy Chicken, and my husband's is Orange Peel Chicken. Our daughter loves the kid's lo mein.   Once in a while I deviate, but sometimes I'm disappointed. Tonight I ordered the Lobster Sushi roll. It was the blandest sushi roll I've ever eaten in my life. Just no flavor at all. It was like eating chunks of rice. Even their wasabi and ginger are bland. I guess an Americanized Chinese food place doesn't know how to make Japanese sushi.   Another disappointing meal I've had here in recent months was the filet mignon dish - I think it was a stir fry. The meat wasn't good. It may as well have been flank steak.   There are other wonderful mainstay dishes on their menu, such as buddha's feast, fried rice, all the chicken dishes, pan fried pork dumplings and Dan Dan Noodles.",

I heard you. Um. Ok.  That was not ok. You are in the service industry and all we wanted was to come for a nice happy hour. Won't come back to this location because of that. We will go to Edina instead.",

We decided on Beer(Hefeweizen) and Mai Tai (cocktail with white rum,dark rum and pineapple juice).The cocktail was refreshing and Fruity with the right amount of Rum.It was well made.They also have a Good collection of Wines.  The Crab wontons are lovely i especially enjoyed the sweet and spicy plum sauce they were served on.We also had the Chang's fried rice(take your pick from chicken,pork,beef,shrimp), Garlic Noodles(egg noodles tossed with garlic and pepper flakes) served with cucumbers on the side and Dynamite shrimp(Crispy shrimp with a tangy sauce).  It was a good experience and i would gladly be back for some Chinese food.",

Our waitress was friendly and helpful. My only issue is with the food. I'm on the keto diet and there was really nothing to pick from. I thought the Beef A La Sichuan would be \"safe\" but it didn't seem to be. It was still tasty, though. The food is overpriced, in my opinion. I could get twice as much food at a mom and pop shop closer to my house. I would say go if you're looking for a place with good atmosphere...",

Waitress was wonderful, I ordered King Pao scallops and they were cooked perfectly.  I wish I could cook them like that.  I ordered banana rolls with caramel and pineapple ice cream to go.

    "text": "It has been years since I have been inside this PF Chang's.  We ate here for dinner on a busy Friday night around 15 years ago and I was very disappointed.  The food was definitely above average but the tables were so close together that it felt like we were having dinner with strangers.  No big deal-we like people but the table next to us was inhabited by a man who thought If he told his wife he wanted a divorce in a restaurant she would not make a scene. First off, I learned way too much about their personal life and secondly, he was wrong. She did make a scene. It just left a bad taste in my mouth (so to speak).  Well I should have gone back sooner.  The food is so so good.  Yesterday afternoon my daughter and I were planning our weekly lunch when she said she had a gift card so I decided to give them another try.  We went at a slow time of day and were seated at a nice comfy booth.   We ordered dumplings and crab puffs to start.   They were so good. Perfectly cooked and delicious.  If I were to be nit picky, one negative was that the lemon wedge on my daughter's water glass  had the sticker on it which would indicate that the lemon had not been washed before it was sliced. For our entrees, I had the Kung Pao Chicken and it was perfect. It is my favorite dish and this one was absolutely excellent. The chicken had just the right amount of crispy and was actually cooked perfectly.  My daughter had the Honey Crisp Chicken and the portion of her meal was enormous.  She loved it and is going to get at least one more meal out of it.  We ordered another order of the Pot Stickers and we asked them to make the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce in to a spicy meal and pack both things up for me to take home to my husband.   He loved both and has enough left that I will not need to fix him lunch today!!! The service was good. Not great but good and we had a very nice afternoon.  Lesson learned do not wait more than a decade to go to this place because the food trumps any lack of privacy.   It did look to me as though there is more room between tables than there was back then but regardless,it was a great lunch.",

I ordered the surf and turf which was way over priced for what you got. The menu said it came with filet mignon, lobster, shrimp, asparagus, and mushrooms. The steak was over cooked and all cut up, the lobster and shrimp were fried, and the asparagus was hard. While I was eating I noticed one of the pieces of shrimp was not deveined and still had its poop running down its back. I was immediately grossed out and lost my appetite. We told our waitress Brittany and she basically blew me off and didn't care. We thought she might have taken off one of our appetizers at least but she didn't. I can definitely say that I will not be returning to PF Chang's.",

I ordered the Black Pepper Steak and sat down to eat with several co-workers. While eating I discovered a piece of some kind of metal wire in the food; it was approximately a half inch in length. I presented this to the woman who was taking payments for the food. She asked what food I'd gotten, and then said \"Thanks. I'll let our manager know about it.\" I didn't see any effort by them to make sure there weren't any further problems with the food, and they continued to serve it as though nothing was wrong. This disregard for the safety of customers is disconcerting. I also informed the person in our company who handles these arrangements with outside food vendors, and hope that someone will actually be held accountable.",

    "text": "So I don't normally do reviews but I experienced some of the worst customer service at this location that I am astounded.  I had a larger order catered for my company, nothing too big. 4 pans total, $200. I spoke with Calvin that informed me I could pay over the phone if I wanted to since online for some reason didn't have a payment option. As I didn't have the card I indicated that I would call back once I did and he informed me that was fine just to ask to speak with the manager. This was on 12/15/15. On 12/17/15 I called and provided the card number to the manager Amanda and confirmed the details and the pick up for 11:15 am on 12/21/15.  This is where things turned into an absolute nightmare. I arrived and couldn't figure out where to park and pick up the food as I'm new to area so I called and was provided with directions. After finding the garage I was informed that I had to park in the PF Chang's take out spots which were all full. I asked if there was anywhere else I can park and was informed they don't control their parking spots and I would need to find somewhere else to park. A huge majority of this parking structure is reserved parking only mind you. So I drive around a few more times without any luck. I called back and asked if I could have the food brought down to me and I was informed no that wasn't an option. (10-15 minutes)   After another 10-15 minutes of circling around someone steals a spot in front of me that had just opened up. I quickly asked the lady was she going shopping and she said no to PF Chang for take out. I decided to wait as I wasn't finding any luck and none of the \"Take out\" parking had become available. I waited another 15 minutes and she finally came down low and behold with a PF Chang employee behind her carrying her food!  I finally head into the restaurant to find out that Amanda had not processed the payment for the food and it turns out someone could have bought the food to my car for me as I initially asked. I wasted 45 minutes of my valuable time due to inefficiency on the behalf of their receptionist and in addition missed the entire first half of the meeting I had ordered food for. Calvin handled the checkout and was pleasant. I admit at this point I was so upset that I lashed out at him when it wasn't his fault. The lack of knowledge and customer service I was provided was definitely something I care not to repeat and I will not be having my company return to this place of business for any future catering needs.",

    "text": "We normally love P.F. Chang ... often going to their restaurant in Mesa west of Power Road.  Yesterday (5/16/17) we decided to go to the one in Scottsdale on Camelback and Scottsdale Road.  We arrived at the front hostess podium and looked around and noticed very few people were dining at 1:05 pm.  Perhaps the snowbirds have all left. The young lady was on the phone, in what was obviously a personal call.  She completely ignored us while continuing to chat.  After what seemed like 2-3 minutes of this nonsense we left.  As we were walking out my wife said we're leaving ... we really wanted to have lunch but can't wait all day to be seated in a virtually empty restaurant.  The hostess gave us a glare and said \"I'm on the  phone\".  This was the tackiest we've ever been treated at any restaurant.  Someone needs to work on customer service.  Personal calls, texting and the like should not be obstructions to serving the public. If it's a legit business call, all the  person has to do is ask that we be patient for a moment.  I spoke to Calvin, the managing partner the next day to report the incident and suggest that some customer service training was in order.  He said he would look at the tapes and speak to his manager because that's not the kind of service that is acceptable in his restaurant.  I asked that he take my name and number and get back to me with assurances the young hostess had been counseled.  He declined to do so.  Struck me as a lack of good will.",

The last time I was there we got there very late and even though they would be closing in a short period of time we were seated and served with cheerful and attentive service. There was no rushing us out the door and no telling us we could not have a particular item because they were about to close.  I recommend this place for the food and service.",

The service was nice even if there was bit of a mix up when we were seated, but the service never was unprofessional one bit. Halfway through the meal the manager came out and spoke to us, and gave us all $10 gift cards for this establishment. For a party of 4 that was quite nice for me that took care of the bill. (I promise I tipped decently on the actual amount.)  The food doesn't impress me, but the restaurant is very nice looking. That together with a surprising service, that gave us a really nice dinner experience. And that is what I wanted to convey by my review.",

Not even worth a second try to be honest, and some of the noodles were \"blocky\" and cold.

Somehow with less than 10 people eating around 10pm, we still had to flag down a waiter to find out who was serving our table. I probably shouldn't even be eating this type of food as I have soy issues, but went with the soyless and tasteless honey chicken as my entree along with some unplanned crunchy rice. Another order was the heavy on the grease and oil loaded fried rice with five types of meat, which I did not try. I suppose 15 bucks is the going rate for a entree at night, but the quality just isn't there anymore. Even most lunch entrees top the 10 buck mark now. I still fondly recall those early days of this franchise when PF was the man - now PF is the old man.",

    "text": "Horrible. Horrible food and horrible service. Man, this place has gone way downhill. I made a reservation Sunday night for 14 of us on Tuesday for my nephews b-day. The hostess had to put me on hold to ask a manager if it was ok. Um...ok? Mgr was super nice and penciled us in. I got a call on Monday AND Tuesday to confirm my reservation...ok. no biggie. We get there and there's literally 2 other tables in the whole place. I didnt catch the servers name but she had a very unique style of serving. She kept asking us if she could \"snag an order\". Like any other restaurant, we wanted appetizers first, then our entrees to come out together. Nope, not this place. Our apps came out sporadically and my uncle got his app as his entree because she never came back to snag his order. He was fine with that as all the plates were decently sized and we shared. My nephew and his girlfriend got their food before my side of the table even ordered. WTF? When I pointed this out to her that we all came in together and wanted to eat together....ya know, like normal, she apologized, which was nice but we were all eating different things at different times and it was just weird. The 4 of us at the end were still eating while my nephew opened gifts and ate dessert. Lame. Everyone pretty much enjoyed what they got except the pad thai was gross. The chicken seemed undercooked a bit and I asked for no cilantro which apparently means extra cilantro but no peanuts. I traded it for the spicy chicken and that was decent. Overall, I will not be back and this is again why people should support locally owned businesses and stay away from corporate.",

It was nice that it was quieter in there. P.F. Changs has a great, relaxing and classy ambiance.  Our food, like I said earlier was fabulous! We ordered a mix of things and shared them. Our server said that the portions were for about two people family style, but we would disagree. We are Italian and believe that we each could have finished our meals we ordered without any issue. They were larger portions than any other chain restaurant.   We ordered potstickers as an appetizer and I don't normally like pork, but these were amazing. Also when our main dishes came, the server brought out an extra entree that she said was made in back on accident. This was a great surprise and also very tasty! We had a great server, she was attentive, but not overbearing. We ordered dessert, both a chocolate cake and a dessert drink and both were equally as delicious as the meals.   Definitely a five star in my book from this experience!",

They were very attentive to our needs and seem to know what we were thinking.  Nash, our waiter was in just one word, Outstanding!   The food was just amazing when compared to other locations I have visited.  Everything from the Chicken Wraps, to the Sweet and Sour Chicken were prepared well beyond my expectations.  If you are in the Old Town Scottsdale area and need to pick from a long list of excellent establishments, place PF Chang's at the top of your list!",

Lots of neighboring restaurants were really full we noticed but due to food allergies, we are always limited in choices at other establishments.   Chang's offers a gluten free menu that doesn't just eliminate pieces of your meal. They took the time to create some True gluten free options and craft them in a separate area of the kitchen.   My wife ordered the Pad Thai and a glass of wine while I ordered 4 potstickers (not gluten free) Chang's gluten free Spicy Chicken and just a lemon water.   The food was up to Chang's expected level of quality. The service was so-so. She just wasn't really engaged in her work, even tho she only had two parties.   All in all, a good meal tho.",

As soon as we walked in the host spoke so quietly I could barely hear what he had to said before he asked us again if there were just two of us and what kind of table we wanted. We sat and waited for our server to come. She finally did and quickly asked if we wanted to order and appetizer or order all together. She never introduced herself, gave us any specials, nothing. Nor did she ever smile as well as looking as she had just rolled out of bed. Thought all of the rest of the servers looked like that.   We got the pork potstickers, side of fried rice and wok fried filet mignon. We were never asked how we wanted our meat cooked.   We got our appetizer and after eating 2 of them I pulled a hair from one I had just taken a bite out of. Since our server never came back to ask how things were or give us more drinks we had to flag her down. Her response was \"oh. ok.\" And said she would get the manager. A couple of minutes later our food came out and after about ten minutes we had finished our food and waited. It took another ten minutes for the manager to show up when we explained what happened and that we had not had a good dining experience. He said sorry and walked away.  All the manager did was comp the appetizer and tell our server to ask again whether we wanted a free dessert. Needless to say we didn't want anything more from them and just wanted to leave.   Poor service. Bad food. Poor presentation.",

The service was kinda slow my family and I, came in for a late dinner so it was empty wasn't busy at all.   They never cleaned off the table or checked to see if we need plates to be removed as what other restaurants would do.   The food: it was OK nothing really to be amazed by after all it's P.F Chang's , I ordered Spicy Tune Rolls it was really plain not much too it expected more to be honest as they offered it as a main plate not an appetizer.   Also ordered sesame chicken , it was very sweet and kind a spongey to be honest wasn't very pleasant.   Also as a appetizer we offered the chicken lettuce wraps they we're just OK.   Once in a great while I'll come in but I don't think I'll visit this one for a while not for the price and quality of the food.  This place is basically good for stop in have a drink or two and maybe an appetizer nothing more.   I hope this helps people to whom ever would like to try this place don't expect much .",

    "text": "This place has REALLY fallen.   We arrived at 6:30 on Sunday night. The restaurant was about 35 to 40% full. There were lots of empty seats, yet we had to wait a few minutes for the hostess to be seated. Not a big deal. We were then sat at what was literally the worst table in the restaurant, right by the takeout door and a post. Again, this would not be a big deal, but there were tons of empty booths and tables all around. We didn't say anything, so maybe this is an unfair complaint.   We ordered wonton soup, Mongolian beef, shrimp lo mein, and egg rolls. The soup came out after about 10 minutes, which was fine. Next followed the egg rolls. I didn't know the egg rolls were a second course, but apparently they are here. Then we waited 20 minutes for our Mongolian beef and lo mein. The Mongolian beef was ice cold, the lo mein was hot. There was a hair in the Mongolian beef, which was absolutely disgusting.  We just wanted to leave. We asked for the check. 5 minutes later we got it. After waiting an additional 10 minutes to get picked up, I just simply went to the manager and asked her to ring us out. People were complaining all around us.  The restaurant appeared adequately staffed. Yet on a fairly empty night, it seemed that no one knew what they were doing.  The manager comped the Mongolian beef. Needless to say, we will not be back.",

I have been to this location many times and it is always the same. This is officially off our list and will never return.  Maybe it time to hire some grown ups to run the restaurant.",

We were in a corner and she went to every table around us repeatedly before finally deciding to talk to us. By then we were done and decided to leave.

We had reservations at 645 and then had to change them to 715, when we got there they only made us wait about 2 mins to clean the table, which was nice!  Allison was our server, which we had her last time as well- super nice, once again:) Great service!  I started with their Bloody Mary not spicy and my husband got a Fat Tire on draft. The bloody mary was sooo spicy even adding tomato juice hah so I ended up getting something else, which they were very accommodating. We started with the chix lettuce wraps, which were awesome as always, then I ordered the Changs spicy Chicken and my husband ordered the Shrimp and Chicken Rice. I was a little disappointed that the Changs spciy chicken seemed a little dry and I have gotten it in the past with success and the Shrimp and Chicken had 6-7 pieces of meat in it. Bummer. TONS of rice tho, you should see the bowl it comes in, so if you like rice with a taste of meat, its your meal, I wouldn't advise for men! Then they brought out a dessert shooter for my bday which was nice. I only had two bites and my husband ate it, which he loved. All together a good place to go, just bummed that the food was a little blah this time. The manager usually comes to the table and asks how everything was and what not, I would have told him our service was great but he was hanging out at the hostess station... but like I said all in all a cool place.",

Anyone who says they don't even mildly like the lettuce wraps is either lying, or just doesn't like things that taste good.   The seared ahi tuna appetizer is also dee-lish.

That long incorrectly worded sentence aside, I have to say, we had a fantastic Chang experience. Mostly due to the fact that we were buzzed after the fabulously thrown Gabi yelp event. And we didn't choose to wait for a table, yet sat at the bar, with the other drinkers. We quickly made friends with the bar staff, and diners on either side of us. The spring rolls were crisp, hot and well, kinda bland. Thank you sides o sauce. The mushu pork was dee lish as was the Spicy Chang Chicken. However, riding the bland wagon, was the chicken fried rice. Undercooked and totally void of flavor. The sake was hot, just like the electronics were our diners to the left were hawking. Seriously. He went to his car to retrieve things. Thanks. But no thanks. Service was outstanding. Energy in the restaurant was fun. Unusual for me to give 4 stars to a chain restaurant, unless there's and in and an out in the name. But here goes for tonight. Four stars PF. Four stars! More on service and ambiance than food. But four stars nonetheless!",

A neatly organized menu with descriptions True to taste  I don't mind supporting the independents when I know where they are, but this week its all about avoiding the hits or misses that I have been enduring in Phoenix over the past 3 months.  I wasn't expecting authentic chinese food- its a chain so if you go in with that expectation then I think you need to do your homework on the meaning of \"chain restaurant\"....  Wish I could have tried more items on the menu. What I did get was excellent- crab wontons, steamed dumplings (can't remember which), and a double pan fried noodles with shrimp. No leftovers on this trip!  Oh, and a PF X. Went down well enough to order a second.  So, my white-bread bottom will be back at this restaurant in the future :)",

Anyway, one thing to ring home about was the lettuce wraps app. Very well, done, although it was hard to recognize the chicken in it.

It's fun to sit outside at 11 pm and down some lettuce chicken wraps and have a nice glass of wine. Plus you can 'shout out' to the folks outside Starbucks just a few feet away.",

No thank you!  Unfortunately I was the only one who felt that way.   PF Changs serves very Americanized Asian cuisine for a tad higher than it's worth in my opinion. If it tastes the same or not as good as my take out Chinese place it's not worth my time or the extra money.",

Very refreshing...I like mojitos and I like Asian pears so it's the perfect combo. I tried many different appetizers but my favorite are the fried green beans and fire dumplings.",

My boyfriend and I like to go on dates here very now and then too.  We both like the pork dumplings that are steamed and pan fried...they are both delicious and of course we always have the waitor mix up some of that great sauce with the hot mustard and chili paste!  I really like the orange chicken, the moo shu chicken, mongolian beef, changs spicy chicken, kung pao chicken and the dan dan noodles.  I also really love their chocolate cake...Ask for it warmed up with raspberry sauce and chocolate sauce with vanilla ice cream! You may only want this for your meal hahaha...This place will always be here and I will always enjoy it!",

The quality of the food was on par with what I experience at past visits but the service was very rushed even though the restaurant was less than half full. Appetizers and main courses were served without adequate time to finish the appetizers prior to the main course arriving at the table.  As we were about half way finished eating our main coursed the server asked if what we wanted for desert. We advised her we were still eating our lunches and were not ready to consider deserts.  About 3 minutes later we were presented with our check.  We were in rushed in and out in about 20 minutes for no reason.  I think a little more staff training would help both the customers and the restaurant.",

But,,,, the items on the gluten free menu are at least $1 more than their same counterparts on the regular menu. I guess that gluten free soy sauce is more expensive?! Please. I had the Singapore street noodle dish. It was okay, but had very little chicken and shrimp in it, and was mainly rice noodles with some cherry tomatoes. The best thing about the gluten free menu was the GF Flourless Chocolate Dome- it was an amazing chocolate dessert, despite the $5.95 price tag. It was well presented with berries, a mint sprig and the oh so pretty drizzles on the plate. It melted in your mouth with a creamy chocolate center. I split it with another person; even though it was small, it was enough for two. Go for dessert!",

Place was smaller and more intimate with outside seating to take advantage of the locale. Egg drop soup just to syrupy for me .... Just keep it simple.  Wonton soup +.  Lettuce wraps done quite well, maybe even the highlight    Entrees included Mongolian beef, spicy chicken. Mongolian beef very salty,  otherwise, nice large portions for the entrees. Only downside was the service. We ordered very quickly upon arriving and but did not get our food for approximately an hour.",

I think most people go to pf Chang's cause it's got nice interior but food wise, pf Chang needs to mind more bout the quality instead of overly charging consumers for low quality food.

Staff is knowledgeable and friendly and there to assist and serve. Definitely will be going back. If you sign up for their Rewards program they send you buy one entree get one free.",

There were about 15 3rd party delivery service pick up people waiting as well and it was a confusing mess. They need to do something diff that works!",

Hope service and food makes it worth the wait.   Another observation, when you have an event free entree with purchase of another, one night only, perhaps staff enough servers and bus staff.  One table sat dirty for over 25 mins. Finally got sat at table at 52 mins past reservation and table still was uncleared.   So the server was excellent.  Took good care of us in our visit.  Food was great too.  That made up for the negatives of the first two paragraphs and helped to redeem this visit.",

There was no sign stating to go to the bar to get my order but I did anyway and preceeded to stand at the bar for 15 minutes waiting for my order, the man prior to my order stated he had been waiting for 25 minutes and was still waiting to be cashed out. I normally get lunch here so this was definitely not the way the restaurant runs. It's pretty disappointing that they cant handle 2 takeout orders.",

First time was in Honolulu -and it was not a good experience, second time was here and once again it was not good  Our server was excellent, but the food was so underseasoned  We had the lettuce wraps - and since PF Changs was the originator of them you would think they would do them well - they were not good - and the sauce is so boring.  We also had the deep fried green beans - which were ok - mostly because of the sauce. The buddhas feast dish was, like everything else - underseasoned and lacked flavour.  I wanted to like PF Changs - I have tried 2 now - and that's it - I won't give them a try again.   Both times were a waste of money and a disappointment.",

    "text": "From opening night at Fashion Square Mall, I have always loved PF Chang's. Yep I was There on the 1st night of operation at Unit 1, for this now mega chain.  For years PF Chang's remained an exciting destination to dine, I remember the crowds and the throngs of ever present managers and chefs working hard and diligent to keep things humming and on point.  Even as the chain grew there was still plenty of excitement in other cities across america. Replication was working and millions of Americans were introduced to skillfully prepared Chinese dishes.  Last week I returned and was dining alone on a mid week night around 7 pm. I knew when entering that the magic has gone, as the restaurant was merely at about 15-20% capacity. and a completely empty bar.  Welcomes and seating was swift so why complain, I'm not. Service was swift and pleasant. and the food was... Well the food has changed. One of my lifetime favorite restaurant appetizers has been rethought and er... remastered. The Chicken lettuce wraps tasted fine, as a mater of fact they tasted just like every other restaurants that strive to duplicate this appetizer. Diced chicken, not ground and the mushrooms although present they are now flavorless, The crispy white noodle could fit in a small childs hand, Then the Lettuce cups Hmmmn the care on serving 5 perfect cups in the past, well I got some lettuce. Then there was the sauce on the side you remember the soy, sambal and vinegar you composed at the table well that doesn't happen anymore. Its pre-made and in a little cup. take it or leave it as my server had no idea what I was talking about.   I also ordered some chicken egg rolls, what the heck? these would have never made the original menu. They arrived hot and crisp on a small side plate with sauce, but no garnish, and worst yet they were cut in half ?!?!? but why?!?!?! why cut an eggroll??? perceived value?!?!    I passed on the dessert mini's. I didn't have the heart to eat from a shot glass.  Gotta do what you gotta do, but with a dining room at 20 percent at 7 pm What did you Do?!?!?!",

It's also a good place to grab dinner at 10:30pm on a Saturday when nowhere else is still open...although I would've wanted to go here anyways. The Lettuce wraps are amazingly good, especially with the yummy sauce they mix up for you at your table. We also ordered the Honey Chicken and the Mongolian Beef, which were both very good too. I like the atmosphere of this location as well, and the server was super friendly and helpful.",

    "text": "PF Chang's ain't bad.  Granted, it's not the best food I've ever had but there is a lot to like about this chain and the food IS of good quality.  I like the following:  1.  The lunch bowls are really inexpensive.  You can get a decent lunch bowl and soup for like 8 bucks ($7.95 to be precise).  That's pretty cheap, man.  I mean, come on.  8 bucks rarely even buys you a 12-pack of beer anymore.  2.  The to-go containers are awesome.  I bicycle around and, to date, no hot soup has spilled down my back.  It snaps together and, VOILA, you're good to go.  3.  Overall, it's pretty fast.  If you work close to a PF Chang's, call a little bit in advance, get it to go and, man, you're set.  Sometimes the people who work at this location think too highly of me and don't realize I'm a fatass.  I'll order my food, the lunch deal and sometimes two spring rolls and they'll give me two forks and two fortune cookies (actually I got three fortune cookies today).  They either think I'm ordering for two or that I need two forks to shovel the food into my mouth twice as fast.  If I were ambidextrous, I so would.  Celebrity sighting!  I saw Frankie Muniz outside of this location, too.  I looked at him as he walked by and I was like, \"Is that the kid from Malcolm in the Middle?\"  I cocked my head like a dog who heard a whistle and he looked a little panicked, like he thought, \"Ah shit.  This guy knows who I am.\"  I didn't say anything cause he was with his chick and I had to fart.    But, hey, Frankie, that sweaty guy who had to fart used to watch your show when he was in school.",

    "text": "Ok, I tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt by visiting it a second time, after my first experience here a few months back, which was dreadful and ended up in a complimentary dinner for my 2 friends and I, even though, all I really got a hold of to consume that evening was the drink that I ordered and not my meal.   Firstly, I was sat kind of in the same general area which I'm just going to dub the slow as hell corner. Last time when I sat in this area, I didn't see my food until and hour after I ordered it, and by then my friend had sent it back in frustration of the wait. This time, it was the same extremely long wait, its like they can get out appetizers and small quick meals, but obviously entrees are a bit more time consuming than that, but an HOUR wait, in between, and there was like 5 tables of people in the entire restaurant, total that afternoon, and then for it to taste mediocre...come on P.F. Chang people!!  The waitress this time was nice, so I made sure she got a good tip, it wasn't her job to make the food so I wasn't blaming her on the untimeliness of it all. However, the waiter I had at the prior visit, spilled water on all of us and didn't even apologize or have someone to come clean it up, I'm like are you serious?!!  The manager of the place is pretty accommodating and apologetic, as he comped our first meal. Although, I didn't see too much of him during my second visit. Otherwise I would have so complained...normally I just grin and bear bad service and talk crap later, but now I'm learning that an unpleasant dining experience is something to say something about, and not after you've left!",

I've found the food is always prepared well, the service is always great, and the prices are reasonable including drink prices.  Oh and now they have these cute little dessert minis for $2.00 each.

I am very paranoid about food poisoning and I'm very picky about food..   So Pf Chang's, yes its a chain, its not own by Chinese people and its kind of generic but its good for what it is.. The hostess always do seem to be snotty but the waiters are nice and quick, the bar is a little expensive but that expected at a restaurant like this, but they do have a great martini menu.. Sometimes I splurge..   I usually always get the Chicken Lettuce Wraps which is one of my favorite things on the menu, they are messy but really good. I tried the vegetarian Lettuce wraps and they were just as good, maybe even better.. I asked if they were really vegetarian (I worked at a restaurant that claimed to be but weren't) and the waiter said that it was suitable for a vegan.. good to know..   For entrees I usually get the Kung Pao Chicken, very good never disappointed.. The Mongolian Beef is also pretty good.. There noodle dishes as alright pretty basic, haven't found one that I would routinely order..  But the thing I like about the food is that it is down well.. It never is too fried, or too oily of slimy etc.. some many Chinese restaurants I've been to just left me feeling like I ate a whole bucket of McDonald's fries, Chang's doesn't leave you with that heavy icky feeling..   Is it the best ever? No, but for what it is its good, I don't go often but when I do go I enjoy it..",

    "text": "To be honest, I really don't consider the food here to be Asian. It's very far removed, but about one step away from being American cuisine. The food here is really good, don't get me wrong. Just don't come in here expecting exciting authentic Asian cuisine. It's \"safe Asian\" for the whitebread, Scottsdale community.   Regardless, the service here is always really good and efficient. The waiters always bring the dishes at the right time and check up on your multiple times to see how everything is. Considering the portions you're offered, you get a pretty good pricing for a meal if you're sharing. Overall, I tend to think the food is more filling than it is flavorful, but that's just my opinion. Some people swear by this place... I am not one of those individuals. The Kung-Pao Chicken isn't bad and it seems to be a staple at this place. The dessert shot glass things are a recent addition to the menu and are actually really good. I wish more restaurants would think of using these because it makes sense after eating a huge meal to get something small rather than a sundae the size of a T-bone.  In all, P.F. Chang's is pretty good. It's a nice spot to have a dinner with friends or family because alot of the dishes are made to be shared. If you're looking for real Asian food however, you're not going to find it here and are better off trying a smaller, family-run place.  (Side note: P.F. Chang's is probably Phoenix's most successful franchise export. They've got locations in LA, Vegas, and a few other cities.)",

Tiny dessert samplers ( $2 a pop ) were quite good and tasty.  I think they changed their menu very recently as they have some new items i never seen on their menu before. And that is cool.

It's usually good if it's a chain they  better have the recipes on point.  So I'm not expecting mind blowing food but good food. So if it's on the menu someone somewhere loved it and hopes the same for your dining experience. So I'll be back and I'll enjoy yet again. Keep up the consistent service and food.",

Unfortunately the service was lackluster which is why I couldn't give 5 stars. We just didn't get the attention we expected. Refills didn't happen and no one checked in with us once the food came. But going back to the food, it was really good and we got enough of it. Shared several plates between 2 adults and 2 kids and for $30 we walked out stuffed. The food definitely made up for the lack of service but it is a shame because we could have had an amazing meal worth raving about. Instead we will go back when in the mood and not more often as we do like to receive good service when dining out.",

    "text": "I haven't been to a P.F. Chang's in ages, but had a craving for vegetarian (vegan) lettuce wraps after a friend mentioned them. I met a friend here at 11:30 a.m. on a Thursday (after the 4th of July) and was surprised to be the only customers in the room for quite awhile. By noon, there may have been four tables of people. I suspect they get a lot of business lunches and the holiday may have reduced that to nothing, but it was eerie. I used the quiet time to ask if the vegetable spring rolls were vegan. They are not - so - vegans beware. The wraps have egg. Bummer. That's okay, because the vegetarian lettuce wraps were plenty enough for me.  The wraps were pretty much the same as what I'd had before, but they don't \"make the sauce\" for you at the table anymore (it has indeed been awhile since I've been there) and you don't have the option to add more heat. I probably could have asked for the mustard and hot sauce, but figured I'd try them as offered. I definitely could have used more sauce, but there was soy sauce on the table so I just added that to the sauce dish. There was plenty of lettuce - half a head really. It's a nice reliable vegan option that has some flavor and doesn't require special requests. However, I talked to my friend for so long that I was hungry by the time I left!  Our server was fine - she mastered the not pestering too much but keeping us topped off style of waiting on people who were there for hours. It's not like they needed the table! I did get very cold after awhile, but given the temperature outside, that's just fine. Parking was a breeze. If you are headed east on Camelback, turn before the corner into the public parking garage, and go to the elevator by the take-out parking spots for Chang's. I probably won't add Chang's to the regular rotation, but it's nice to know it will still do in a pinch!",

We were a party of three so we figured the wait wouldn't be too bad.   We walked in and headed straight towards the hostesses to check in. One of the hostesses, (male) just gave us a weird look and went on to do what he was doing. We stood there and just looked at him. He didn't greet us or not even a \"we will be right with you.\"   Out of the corner the other hostess, (female) quickly ran over and helped us out. I gave her my number and she said the wait would be about 20 to 30 minutes. We headed outside to wait.   Waiting wasn't bad, and they txted us when our table was ready. Our server came over right away and she dropped off menus. The dining area was very busy so it was a tad bit loud inside. Our table was very STICKY so we did ask our server for a rag to wipe it down. She came on over and she quickly wiped it down for us.   We ended up ordering a spicy chicken noodle soup, one order of the chili garlic green beans, and the kung pao chicken.   The chicken noodle soup is the BEST!!!! If you haven't tried it, please do. Our kung pao chicken was very flavorful and the green beans were great! The food was delicious!   The waitress was friendly and she did a great job with refilling our drinks. The inside is a bit too dark for my liking. Ive been to a bunch of other locations and this location seems to be the darkest one inside.   I will be back when in the area! Oh and do sign up for their rewards program!",

    "text": "I guess I should know better then to pick this place for a quick lunch. I will blame myself for getting the latest round of mediocre service and sub standard Chinese food on my inability to wait in the line that was in front of Culinary Dropout which basically forced us to choose to eat here.  My husband and I couldn't even remember the last time we ate at PF Chang's. We thought it had been at least 10 years and it was in Albuquerque, New Mexico for heaven sakes. That's how unimpressed we are with their food.  Well so when it comes to spending $50 for two people at lunch, this is the place to come and waste it.  First of all note, that if you choose to eat inside the restaurant that it's freezing cold and to bring a jacket. If you decide to eat on the patio like we did, note that you will bombarded by the flies that will come around as soon as your food is served.  Due to the restaurant being very cold, we decided to eat outside. We should of known better. Everyone knows that if you choose to eat outside when there's only one other diner that the service you get will be less then stellar.  Our waitress didn't come around for 10 minutes and she seemed very rushed and def not attentive. No small talk for this one.  We decide to order from the Wok lunch specials of kung pao chicken and Mongolian beef, with two iced teas. Within 15 minutes our food came up and as you can see from the pictures, it's a lunch portion with more rice then chicken and more rice then beef. My kung pao chicken had celery and peanuts mixed in. Not a water chestnut in sight.  The taste of my chicken was served hot, had decent flavor and a bit salty. My hubby's Mongolian beef was a little tough and his scallions a plenty. Way too plenty. It was the only thing the beef was served with. The lunch specials were okay, nothing special.  Still hungry and even with the \"fiies\" buzzing around and a waitress that was never around, we decided to order two desserts to continue to feed our hunger or hope for a better experience.  While we were waiting for our monster chocolate cake and the banana spring rolls, the table next to us hadn't been bussed in the 30 minutes we were eating there and consequently, more flies started buzzing around.  Since our waitress was busy doing other things, gosh knows what, we put our finished plates on the other table to prevent attracting more flies towards us. This was a good idea.   Our cake and banana spring rolls were finally served and ta da...thank heavens it turned out to fill our sweet tooth needs and make us feel not so hungry. The cake was so large that we took it 3/4 of it to go. If you order this, make sure that you know that it's a group cake good enough for 2-3 people to share.  Overall, the service was mediocre ( I had to stand up and leave the patio to ask us the waitress to fill my ice tea ), the food so so and the flies did not help.  As far as coming back to the location, we'll wait another 10 years to try again as there are far better places to spend $50 for lunch in Paradise Valley/Scottsdale.",

Chang's was the best!!! They were super accommodating/efficient and also had some employees work just for my birthday dinner!! Our waiters had great personalities and made my night wonderful! Overall the experience was more than I could've imagined! Talia was the one who assisted me and really went out of her way to make it happen. They had a busy night but she insisted on working my large party into the schedule. The food was good as always and price is so reasonable for the portions!! They know how to run a great business. I am a loyal returning customer and highly recommend this location!",

She was kind, attentive, and didn't rush us. It was kinda a big deal bc we've been feeling rushed at other places ...  The Fried Banana dessert was so yummy with fresh strawberries & blueberries, that we actually ordered a 2nd one (even though it was now after 10pm). Again, Jessica was sweet & kind and let us order ....",

We ordered our food, picked up, got it all the way home (which is not close!) and realized they had given us a completely wrong order. The order they gave us contained shrimp which I have an allergy to so i wasn't able to even eat it if I wanted to. Ok so I know mistakes happen but here's why I'm so upset. We called down there to tell them what happened and they said they would send us a gift card to make things right since we didn't live close. We thought this was more than fair ... well guess what, the gift card never even came. We all know this place isn't cheap so we spent a good amount on food I didn't even get to eat. Literally threw money down the drain! Thanks a lot PF Changs   UPDATE! I reached out and they made things right. They told me that it may have not gotten done due to the holidays. I get it, it's a crazy time and super busy. They sent me the gift cards and this time I actually received. Thanks for making it right!!",

    "text": "Went to the Scottsdale P.F.Chang's  The waitress suggested the Ginger Chicken with Broccoli.  I love veggies so order her suggestion.  The brown rice came in a small dish and was very dry and I hardly had enough to mix with the entree; plus there was no room on the plate to stir the meal.  The broccoli surrounded the chicken on the plate.  The broccoli was steamed and now getting cold since it was not mixed with sauce and chicken.  Mixing it with the sauce would have added flavor too.  As I ate the broccoli, I noticed the sauce was under the chicken only.  I asked the waitress why wasn't the dish all stir fried together.  The sauce would have helped keep the broccoli warm and flavorful.   She suggested next time I am in for a meal, tell them and they will stir fry that dish.  Isn't this an Asian type restaurant?  She did not offer to have the chef stir fry the remaining meal.  I had only eaten a little of the broccoli.  Humm..  Not  very smart.  I probably won't be back.",

I had a chicken breast dish off the lunch menu which was also breaded. I could have gotten a dish like mine at a strip mall hole-in-the-wall Asian style restaurant. There was a choice of soup or salad. My salad was a nice size and not bad. The soup was ordered by three others, and it was egg drop soup. Egg drop soup is not rocket science. The soup was so bad nobody would eat it. It tasted like nothing. I tried to eat some of it. The service was adequate. We hadn't been there in a few years but it used to be fairly busy. It was almost empty. Sadly, Pei Wei, which is a lower tier restaurant owned by the same people is better. We won't be returning,",

My buddy and I went there just for the hell of it, as I haven't been to one in years.  I got a PF-X drink, which I highly recommend.  It has some mango rum, sprite, and something else that gives a well balanced drink.  He got a pear mojito which was okay, since I am not a big fan of mojitos.  We sat at the bar and got incredible service and attention from the bartender there.  I give an extra start to PF Chang because I think they value customer service.  As an appetizer we got chicken lettuce wrap.  It is a diced up chicken in soy sauce that goes into an empty fresh lettuce.  To complement our dish, our bartender made a sauce mixed with soy, chili pepper, and mustard.  This added a nice kick to our lettuce wraps.    My man dish was the mahi mahi with lemon grass cilantro brown rice.  The lemon grass was almost as good as lemon grass from a Thai restaurant, and that is saying quite a bit.  My friend got the honey glazed chicken, which was okay.  Overall was a pleasant experience.",

I have been coming to this restaurant since I was in high school and I should have stuck with my tried and True dishes: Crispy Honey Shrimp, Green Beans and Lettuce Wraps.   Since it was lunch we went with the lunch bowl menu. The prices were very cheap, about $9 or so and it came with soup and either white or brown rice. I got the Honey Chicken and it was just okay. The egg drop soup I liked much more than the Hot & Sour. The service was very slow. We were there at about 2pm, so I think thats after lunch rush, but they seemed to be very understaffed for how many people were there. Overall, food was just okay, but the price was right!

    "text": "Been to one Chang's, been to them all. Except for the specific decor, they're a chain. My sister was in town on business recently and had a craving for Chang's so we stopped here before shopping across the street. We each tried their new Pad Thai dish with chicken and shrimp...meh, ho hum. Trust me, stick with their tried-and-True dishes. My faves are the Dan Dan Noodles, the Crispy Honey Chicken, and Singapore Street Noodles. The crab wontons, chicken lettuce wraps, and dynamite shrimp are my favorite appetizers. They also make a mean key lime martini.   This location is good -- it's on the SWC of Camelback and Scottsdale Rds, across from Scottsdale Fashion Square near the waterfront. Inside and outside seating are available.",

The staff then tells me they canceled it and I have to add that plate back on I let them know I can't and after 15 minutes of on and off holds I'm told to call DoorDash. Really? I asked to talk to the manager because to me there's just a matter of common sense here, either you apologize and include it because you had no reason to cancel the order in the first place or you take a card over the phone ... 6 minutes later Ken the manager gets on the phone who hardly lets me get a word in and finishes with \"okay okay just come pick it up no problem\". Ken, I don't think you know how DoorDash works or how customer service works.",

I forgot my phone and the restaurant was technically closed, yet customers where still dining (11 o'clock they can't seat anymore customers). We called and asked if we could retrieve the phone, we had a flight to California the next morning. The manager made no effort to compromise and help us retriever the phone. Eventually, she called security and those guys, the real MVP's got us the phone. Long story short, the manager is not very friendly.",

    "text": "What an awesome experience I had, so great that I am writing a review for a chain restaurant that already has what- 1,000 reviews???  I took my mother to lunch yesterday, and this was the destination. After several strokes, she struggles to walk and uses a walker. The great service started w/ a phone call to ask about the best parking for easy access, because after circling around, it was truly a mystery to me. The lady who answered advised me of exactly where to park and suggested entering at the take-out door because it was a much shorter walk. Once we got in we were allowed to select any seat we wished.  Our waiter was so genuinely sweet, attentive and helpful. Neither one of us had been there for some time and we asked for suggestions from the lunch menu. He made several very descriptive recommendations that made our ordering very simple. He kept the delicious and fresh iced tea coming.    Every food item was perfectly prepared & served as it should be- hot items hot, cold items cold. The egg drop soup was so flavorful I don't' think I will ever be able to enjoy it anywhere else again. The salad was perfect- lightly dressed, perfect balance of greens and other ingredients.   Our entrees were Walnut Shrimp with Melon and Mongolian Beef, which we shared. The honeydew balls were a perfect foil for the crispy shrimp and honey glazed walnuts. The Mongolian Beef was amazing- so often is is chewy at other places but PF Chang's preparation using quality beef results in a tender steak quality product.  I am perplexed as to how PF Chang's fell off of my radar.  Yes! We will return, and it will be soon.",

They remembered my order, as all aloha systems do regarding takeout orders.  Fine.  Pad Thai again with a certain amount of fear because of the last experience.  Upon arrival, I choose to inspect my order.  Greeted by a nervous bartender and manager.    They both looked at me like I was violating some takeout rule.  I told them I had a bad experience last time.  I need to check the order.  I likened it to when you're slumming it and have to check your burger before you leave the drive thru.    The manager, never introduced himself, was wearing a blue and white vertical striped shirt and a black suit.    He asked me what had happened upon the last take out.  I told him the noodles were in pieces.  Chopped up.  He literally tossed a free appetizer card over the bar.  I tossed it back.  He returned the motion.  I felt like we were playing air hockey at a certain point.    You will find no personal service from this location.  While walking out, I saw a woman sleeping in a booth.  Literally, curled up.  Food still on the table.  Is she an employee?!  And if so, why is Mr. Manager allowing this impression?!! Get your shit together Pf.!!!",

The wait wasn't bad until the host called my name just to tell us our table wasn't ready they were cleaning it. 12 minutes later I went up to ask and they said they were just cleaning it right now. Why call me at all then? We sat down my friend ordered a glass of wine. We were quickly served our Coke and iced tea but almost 20 minutes later she still did not get her glass of wine. I finally had to ask another server for it because we had never seen our server John again. That server brought it within a minute. Finally our food came but her daughter's Mongolian beef came without rice. John said it was still being cooked and would take a few minutes. She sat and waited for it not touching her food. Didn't see John again. When he finally appeared I asked and he spun around like he completely forgot it. At least when we sent her whole meal back he took it off the check.",

Drinks were brought out quickly and our server suggested the jicama tacos for appys- they are delicious! They have a little zing to them which is a great accompaniment to the jicama. We enjoyed the ginger chicken and broccoli and the orange peel chicken. They even offer a decent size gluten free menu. I know they are a chain but I do wish their sauces did not contain so much sodium and preservatives. We all drank a ton of water after our meal and still had headaches the next morning.

As she was serving entrees to another table she stopped to show us what one of the plates looked like.

We decided to have lunch here and lucky for us we came in just in time for happy hour.  This restaurant  was not crowded at all. The hosts were very cordial and seated us immediately. For lunch we ordered the orange ginger edamame, the crab wontons, orange peel chicken as our entree and the banana egg rolls for dessert.   I must say wow! Our food was so fresh and delicious. There is so much attention to detail and the presentation is just beautiful on these dishes.   Our crab wontons were decorated with what what presumed to be alfalfa sprouts? They were nice and crunchy and I recommend you dip them in the pool of sauce that comes with it.  The orange ginger edamame was also fantastic and the blend of flavors made for  very exiting appetizer.  We shared the orange peel chicken with white rice and it was just the right amount for two (considering we ate appetizers and we also wanted dessert). The orange on the chicken was not overpowering and made for a decadent dish.  If you ever make it to dessert foodie, I highly recommend the banana eggrolls. It is just mind blowing! There are pieces of banana inside an eggroll. This is accompanied by their delicious pineapple icecream and side of fresh berries with mint leaves. This dessert is a delicious blend of flavors and textures. Try a piece of mint leaf with the icecream. It is just absolutely delicious.  The food wasn't the only great thing here. Our waitress was phenomenal. She made our lunch experience so enjoyable. She had such a great disposition and always attentive.  I definitely recommend this restaurant. It's conveniently located near lots of great stores. If you like sharing food I personally enjoy doing the 3 course meal with appetizers, sharing an entree and then sharing a dessert.  Overall a great way to spend our layover. Their Mai Tai will also add a little kick and refresh to your meal. Enjoy!   Everything was so neatly placed and everything was delicious.",

The food is always timely, and delicious. And if you have a large party, the tables in the middle if the dining room are easily moved to accommodate 20+ people. Highly recommend this location!",

Especially from the manager Amanda a few weeks ago I came in with a gift card for $100 and purchased a pick up order with my order I think I left my gift card there when I called she remembered me and said that she would give me the balance for my gift card and had something typed up for me when I came to pick it up she kept it for a few weeks and had it all laid out for if anyone else were to be there when she was not there when I came in tonight my meal was completely taken care of with this gift card that was my fault for losing I really appreciated the amazing customer service and the food is always great thanks again Amanda and your team!!!",

    "text": "First time to P.F. Changs!  Heard lots about this Resturaunt and it looked like it was going to be an awesome Resturaunt. I'm not impressed. The Resturaunt was not busy and it lacked any kind of cool feel. I was expecting something more upscale. Service was slow and sub par.   Ordered the Mongolian beef and it was over done and did not have much flavour. Also had the lobster fried rice. It was ok. Nothing special. Had to add chili oil to try and give it life. Unfortunately it wasn't until almost finishing the meal that the waitress checked on us and then we were able to request. We were left wondering where our waitress had gone for most of the dining experience.   Not sure if they just had an off night but I really can't see how a chain was born out of this stuff.   I'd say it would have been ok for take out or something. Not for a dining experience. Maybe I was expecting the wrong thing. Oh well at least I got to try it.",

Nothing was comped.",

    "text": "I figured it was time for an update for this local (yes, local!) restaurant. Did you know that PF Chang's started in Arizona and in fact, this location is the flag ship restaurant for all the Chang's. That means this restaurant will have updates and changes to the menu before anyone else.   This is a good option if you're looking for a decent meal with good service. You know what you're getting here because they have their concept perfected. We recently dined here and had Chas as our waiter. Chas is also a trainer and was not only very knowledgeable but also friendly and suggested tweaks to our food that made it even better. When you dine here, ask to sit in Chas' section!",
