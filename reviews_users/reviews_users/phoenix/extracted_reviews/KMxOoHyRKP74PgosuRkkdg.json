    "text": "Nice small place, with a modern feel. Great service.  Ordered Torta Paquime ($5.49) and one Asada ($5.99) to go. Cashier was very nice and friendly. Explained to me all the details about Torta Paquime, which turns out you can order hot or cold. While I waited for my order I listened to her describe some of the menu items to other customers and it was kind of cute : P  Place looks very neat and the cooks wear uniforms and look very professional.  Tortas were delicious. I liked the Paquime a little better. Tortas were cut in half and neatly kept in place with a pick. There come with chips and were in a cardboard box. Overall I am very impressed with this place and will be back soon.",

A little pricey, but they have fresh-brewed iced tea and biodegradable Packaging and containers. Maybe they could have been a little more friendly, but the place was clean. They also serve beer.",

Well the register girl was rude as if asking for a sample of the juices was like pulling a tooth . And the food was salty as if adding salt is trying to hide a horrible taste or something this includes the salsa the avocado was the kind you'd get from the super market isle that was know good . Any how I I'd go to this place on your own risk . Don't say I didn't warn yu specially if yu have high blood pressure . Yu need to be healthy to eat at this place with all the salt thy put in there food.",

The interior is very clean, decorated nicely and good looking pastries showcased in a glass case right in the front. My husband and I each ordered the ribeye tacos. The verdict? Meh. The meat had no spice at all. Everything was generally flavorless. Had me thinking we should have ordered the barbacoa which I avoided because I didn't want too much spice. I'm married to a Mexican man and have eaten delicious Mexican food- I know what is good, what is bad, what is ok. This place is \"just alright\". We prefer good food over good decor. Nice, but will not be back. There is an amazing Mexican place just south of here 7th street. Worlds better. We will stick to that.",

With a limited liquor license you can also enjoy some beer and wine with tacos and Tortas. In cooler weather the outdoor patio is an unparalleled way to enjoy the food and beverage.  Start out with some papa-nachos, Fish tacos, volteados tacos and a Mexican hotdog.  Finish with a Napolitano flan for desert..o and try the watermelon agua Fresca.  You won't be disappointed.",

We got the Carnitas, Pastor, Barbacoa & Ribeye Tacos; all were significantly better than what you would find standard in Phoenix but my favorite were the Barbacoa and Ribeye Tacos.  The Cubano came served with platanos (which were AMAZING) and was super good. My husband and I love spicy so it may be too much for anti-spicy people, but it had a fabulous marriage of flavors. The sandwich was both complex and familiar. Don't forget to use a little of the sauce the sandwich comes with!  We both cleaned our plates and did not use any of the salsa from the salsa bar (the food didn't need it!)  One of our favorites in Phoenix. We WILL be back!",

The staff was friendly and helpful with our questions.  The best part for me was the massive sugar cookie they have. It's huge and delicious and to top it off, it was $0.59 (I think). Get outta here!

No sir. The meat tasted weird, I don't have any other description for it other than weird. It just didn't taste good.  I'm not sure how you can mess up cilantro but that tasted janky too. Did not taste fresh or even like cilantro.  The tortillas left a nasty film that coated the roof of my mouth.  The only positive was the frescas con crema had very fresh strawberries.

Damn, it's hard to believe that I haven't been there in almost 2 years and it is mainly because their prices have reached critical mass. To be honest I went in there twice in the last two years and both times I looked at the menu on the board and saw those full grown adult prices that I've watched grow from infancy and I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I just can't do it! I refuse to pay God knows how much now for my once favorite Ribeye Tacos that used to cost 7 or 8 dollars! This s*** is probably $15 by now! Not to mention the growth of all the other food item prices. Now by no means am I cheap but I still have to sleep with myself at night. ... and when I take naps.  Dang, I sure do miss Paquime but I'm already getting raped by organizations and entities in life that I have no control over. Just like every other hard-working person  trying to make it. There is absolutely no way will I walk in there and voluntarily get raked over the coals. Gonna miss you Paq xoxo",

On top of having to wait about 25min the kids meal burrito I also order was cold to the point the chess they used in it was falling out of it. I did send it back and they gave me another one the second time around the burrito was so hot it burn my hand to even touch it. I was not about to give It to my child and have her burn her mouth so I end up take it home. Overll all I honestly didn't like this place at all.

The place is a bit more upscale and trendy that your standard, authentic taco joint - don't expect to find buches or cabeza or any other yummy but nasty bits here, and in place of gritty carne asada meat you'll get \"ribeye\" tacos.  It's all really good though.  The pescado (fish) is generously portioned and high quality, the barbacoa was flavorful on its own and the ribeye was great with their slightly spicy red sauce.",

My husband wanted to try the Mexican hot dog, it was okay but didn't compare to our favorite spot. We decided to share our meals so we got half and half. Now I know  how delicious and tender the ribeye is. We had chips with salsa and the best  guacamole I have ever tasted. The chips were really good, I'm pretty sure they're homemade. The chips also came with a basic tomatillo salsa it was okay.  My favorite was the guacamole it was so good my husband who really doesn't like it ate some. And for dessert we tried the ice cream, a scoop of chocolate and a scoop of pistachio.  The ice cream was really good reminded me of gelato. I would recommend coming here try out the ribeye in either taco or burrito form, chips with guacamole and salsa you won't regret that. They also carry beer for $3 a bottle or a michelada which was okay needed a little bit more chili but was good with our meal.",

Lots of seating, cute servers, and a nice millennial atmosphere. Absolutely one of the best Mexican joints in PHX.",

It was tasty but TINY (it looked like a big flauta) and came with a couple waffle fries. For $6 that was a rip off. I also had the elote (they called it \"eskites?\") Which was pretty authentic but I wouldn't order it again, too much mayo. The decor *is* nice, and I guess that's what you pay for. The service was TERRIBLE. We walked up to the counter where one women was counting the drawer and the other woman watched and weren't even acknowledged by either of them as we stood and waited in front of them. After a while I greeted them and then the one watching politely told me they'd be with is in a minute. I get it if they are training or something but it happened again when we wanted to order desert. A new cashier just stood there pressing buttons on the register for almost 2 whole minutes. The service staff are in no hurry to help you. The old fashioned ice cream was heavenly and I would go back for desert (only).",

I will definitely split an order of tacos to save room for a dessert next time.  Tip:  Try the apple slices (not on the menu board).

The ribeye tacos are pretty much my go to...I get them about every other time. My second favorite are the esquites which is way easier than trying to eat the corn on the corn. I get the toppings on the side which they never give me a hard time about. Overall, the approach of the restaurant is to provide fresh quality Mexican food with a sustainable approach. This place is definitely one to keep on rotation!",

The restaurant is small but super clean and nicely decorated. Definitely not your typical taco place.  I had the ribeye tacos and they ask you how you want your steak cooked when you order. The order comes with four tacos garnished with a slice of avocado and finely chopped cabbage on a flour tortilla. Aside from the really nice presentation which I'm totally a sucker for, the tacos were ah-maze-ing!! They obviously use quality ingredients and it was totally worth the $7.50! I will most definitely be back to try out some other menu items!",

The restaurant is neatly tucked into the corner of a plaza, and has a clean, modern aesthetic with lots of yummy desserts on display, including homemade popsicles. At first glace at the taco menu, I gawked at the $7+ prices. \"These tacos better be enormous or made of dinosaur meat,\" I thought to myself. The host clarified that the prices were for an order, which includes 4 tacos. I ordered two orders, carnitas and barbacoa.  Unfortunately, the service was extremely slow. I ended up waiting half an hour for my to-go order, with myself and the two ladies in front of me constantly checking up on our order since the wait was so long, and it was not just mine. Finally, the host gave me my order, which turned out to be cold! I was so disappointed and sad. For that I need to remove one star. I really don't want to, but all that wait for cold tacos! Of course we ate them anyway, and they were OK. It would've been better fresh though!",

    "text": "Stopped in here with some friends for dinner based on a recommendation they had received. For an \"order at the counter\" restaurant, I was very impressed!    Located at Central and Dunlap in a strip mall. Its a really nice space. Very clean with a pretty extensive menu for the type of place this is. One thing I always like to mention is a clean bathroom, spotless here!   I had an order of chips, salsa and guacamole for an appetizer and for my entree I had the rib eye street tacos. To drink I had a Mexican bottled Coca-Cola. They have a variety of bottled beverages as well as a soda fountain.  They also serve beer.   We all ordered and took a seat outside.   One of employees brought out the guacamole. It is served with a huge portion on fresh chips, a bowl of salsa and two large scoops of fresh guacamole. Salsa was excellent, the guacamole was pretty good, it just needed a pinch of salt.   There is also a self serve salsa bar with all the traditional fixing of a Mexican restaurant like this. Pickled carrots, jalapenos, onions, etc.   Next came my rib eye tacos. I was immediately impressed by the presentation. Four street tacos and served with a grilled onion, grilled jalapeno and some sauces. These tacos were bursting with flavor and didn't require anything added. Fresh,  tender rib eye cooked to order (medium) for me. I highly recommend trying these.  My friend who also ordered these was equally impressed.   Another friend ordered the fish tacos and he said there were outstanding. Fish tacos are served three to an order.   Be sure to give this place a try. I can't wait to return and try more of what they offer!   Enjoy!",

As we were waiting they could have made more cheese and if they didn't want to the least they could have done was tell us there isn't enough.

They came out really quickly and were awesome with all the different salsas. The salsa bar here might also be the best around.

I asked the employee at the counter, what was the favorite menu item that their regulars come to order time and time again.  He said very affirmatively, the rib eye tacos.  I said I'll have that.  I wanted mine rare.  My rib eye tacos came RARE indeed, and they were delicious.  4 for $9, menu says you get 8 ozs of meat in them.  Although rare, they still had a hint of the charbroiled flavor in the meat.   MeetUp member sitting to my left ordered the same rib eye tacos, but \"medium rare\".  To my eyes, they were \"well done\", not even pink.  I showed him my rare color.  He said his tacos were good, but was \"not overly impressed\" with them, which he considered could be his fault.  I said if I did not get what I ordered, I'd send it back, but he did not.  Person sitting to my right ordered the fish (red snapper) tacos.  He thought they were so delicious.  I felt three 4 inch tacos for $8 wasn't much food, but then again, the fish is red snapper (they said), and not tilapia.    The corn chowder soup was really good, but everyone who tasted it, agreed, that it needed more salt.  I also tried the broccoli soup on another day.  That had enough salt!  It was really really good!  I went back on another date to try the fish tacos.  Yes, they were really delicious, but for both the fish and rib eye tacos, I keep replaying what one Yelper said about this place, copy and pasted here: \"So its a nice lil spot but i think the prices are sort of high. 4 lil street tacos is like $8bucks wtf!  Probably wont be coming bak, portions is too little for the price\".  His little review got the most \"useful\" votes, many times the others.    According to Yelper posting in  2015, the rib eye tacos were only $7.49 then, now $9.00 for four 4\" corn tortillas.  When I posted on our MeetUp that I kept thinking about, that I do not see \"value\" here for the price, either, person sitting to my right who ordered the fish tacos said \"what we were served were \"street tacos\". That's their size. I found the ingredients and presentation way above average, so I would definitely go back. The prices? We're paying for better food quality, not size of portion....my 3 cents\".  I said to him \"You might like The Mission in Scottsdale, cos you get even LESS for more money ($12 for only three 3\" meat tacos, no sides), but it is really tasty.  I told him I like paying for better food quality AND generous size of portion BOTH. Two of those places is Kyber Halal and it's sister restaurant Tahoorah Grill's Sunday buffet.  Otherwise I would give Paquime 5 stars if I paid $7.49 for the rib eye tacos.    Today, I spoke to the Paquime manager about rib eye tacos being $7.49 last year and $9.00 this year.  He said that the price of ribeye tacos will go UP again, SOON, cos it is costing them more and more money to get the ribeye, and they are losing money.  He dared me to find cheaper rib eye tacos anywhere in the Phoenix  area.  I bought the Flan Napolitano $4, because a Yelper said it was the best flan she ever had in her life!  I agree, couldn't remember a richer flan.  But there are two kinds, Flan Napolitano is baked, and in the pictured take-out clear container.  The other one is more orange in color, and she said is boiled, and comes in a clear round sealed container, called Flan Casero $3 (Casero = homemade), which I did not try.    I will come here again to try the other tacos, and the $3 \"boiled\" flan..",

My meals were quite lengthy in time to receive although I ordered different items each time and they were quite simple. Upon discussing why this was happening I was told because if someone else has an order easier to prepare they may do them first. Well, some of us are on time constraints and don't wish to be treated in such a poor manner. I will not be giving them anymore if my business.   Just received this from Yelp.

My wife found this place on Yelp and we took my parents to it on our last night in town for our last trip, and boy was it good.  My wife and I got two different kinds of tacos so we could sample more items, including swapping between us.  They were excellent.  My parents got the same burritos and not only did they love them, but my wife and I finished my mom's and we also loved them.  And boy, do they do Tres Leches cake right!  We're definitely returning here the next time we're in town.",

The owner made an exceptional customer recovery and was very understanding and helpful.  He did offer me the apology that I thought was due and I am now a happy customer.  Thank you Paquime for making it right.  Staff is not well informed in their own products not vegetarian friendly.  I went today for lunch and the place was really packed which at first I thought was great because it meant the food should be delicious the inside tables were all full so I did my order to go.  After ordering the Vegetarian Paquime torta I waited 25 minutes for my order to be ready.  Once I got to my work I noticed that my torta had meat.  I wanted to call the store but the receipt did not have the phone number listed.  The rest of my break was spent calling the store.  When I explained this ordeal to the employee she laughed, just plained laughed.  After a few minutes the manager, Bania, got the phone, she told me that they did not have a vegetarian torta since the Paquime comes with pork. I told her that their menu  reflected otherwise, since it listed the torta as a vegetarian option and that is the way I ordered it  after asking the cashier what came with it (which the girl that took my order did not know) and I did not think it was funny that her employee laughed.   Bania, then said well what is the problem with your order then?  I explained to her that I just wanted to inform them about the mistake that was made but that I did not appreciate that her employee laughed and that noone apologized and by now my whole lunch was over and I did not have anything to eat.  The situation was not handled profesionally, and yes I know I could have just taken the meat out, ate the darn thing and everyone is happy, but I wanted to inform them about the mistake so it could be avoided in future.   This place did not impress me and will more likely stop me from going again.",

    "text": "We tried this last night for the first time. Place was very clean. Lighting was minimal, it seemed really dark inside. We both ordered the fish tacos and an order of chips and salsa-to go. Fish tacos were amazing, they had a tasty orange sauce on them. There are three tacos in an order. Plenty of well seasoned fish on each taco. The tacos came with lime wedges, extra orange sauce and a green salsa, and a grilled green onion that I wasn't sure what to do with. The chips are made in house I believe, they were delicious. The salsa was really good, not spicy(which I like), and not super tomatoey. It was more orange in color and it had a little sweetness to it. I don't know if it's standard for each order of chips and salsa, but a large container of awesome guacamole was in our bag too. We will definitely be back, I need to try the ribeye tacos that everyone else is talking about!  I returned a few days later to try the ribeye tacos. I ordered the ribeye tacos and chips and salsa to go. I ate the tacos and some of the chips. Later that evening, I was going to eat the rest of the chips and salsa, when I found an unidentified object that looks like a fried bug or bug part on one of my chips. The business was closed when I found it, so I brought it in the next morning. One of the chefs was the initial person I showed it to. He couldn't tell me what it was. He brought in another employee from the back kitchen, who told me it was a piece of potato. Sorry, does not look like potato to me! He asked me if I wanted another order, I said no. He asked me if I wanted my money back, I said yes please. I had also brought back the containers of salsa and guacamole. The employee proceeded to open the containers, then gestured to them, as if a refund was out of the question because the containers were not full. Well no sir, I unfortunately did not have the pleasure of finding a nasty 'something' in my food until I had already eaten some of it. There was half of the container of chips left, and half of the salsa and guacamole. Which is beside the point. The employee just kept shrugging his shoulders and pointing to the containers. I asked if there was a problem issuing a refund, and he just said 'well', and pointed to the containers again.  I told him to keep his money and his food. He told me I could try coming back later. I walked out after he said that. I didn't bring the food back to get $4 dollars returned and 'get something over on them'. I'm not in the practice of trying to get food for free, which is what he was insinuating. I brought it back because I thought a food business would care that they served something questionable. Stuff happens in restaurants, but make it right. I have my ideas of what it is on that chip-make it right. I will definitely not be returning to this establishment.",

    "text": "I discovered this place while driving to Long John Silvers, don't get me wrong, I love that place but I changed my mind last minute and ended up here. As I go through the photos on yelp, I seen that they had elotes (Mexican corn on the cob) and was excited! (Also their tacos looked good) but I got the super nachos and the corn in a cup. What a disappoint that was! The corn in the cup was super runny and soupy, the cashier asked if I wanted lime and I was like sure but however there was too much. The lime flavor with the soupy crumble cheese corn on the cup was a turn off and that's surprising because I believe the \"recipe\" of the corn is simple, too simple to mess up yet I was proven wrong. This is the first time  I was actually dissatisfied with corn in the cup that I only took 3 spoonfuls. Even in Los Angeles at the Garment District where they have street food and the corn in the cup, it isn't made THAT watery. After that I was hoping the Super Nachos would redeem this place but it turned into a flop as well. I did notice the Nacho Cheese machine but still went with it anyways because I never really experienced anything bad from that machine nacho cheese. I stress about the nacho cheese (lol) because it did leave a nasty after taste, you would only experience this after taste with cheap cheese. They could of least hooked it up with whatever cheese they use at Taco Bell, come on now. However the steak was good and the guac was good on the nachos, I was pretty much hungry at this point so I split the nachos in half and ate them regardless. We ordered 2 corn in the cup and nachos (she says it can feed 2 but..I think 1 person) 2 drinks, came put to 21 dollars...I wish I could go back and change my mind to continue in route to Long John Silvers. I believe this place just opened so maybe in the future I will come back and try their tacos.",

Their Cubana Torta is one of my favorites.",

    "text": "This place is going to be one of my new stops on my lunch rotation. Usually work in this area a couple times a week and now this just made it that much better. Hello Gourmet Tacos and then some!  Inside is very nice and rather modern looking. The menu items are written on some clear glass behind the counter and the soups of the day are displayed on a hanging roll of brown paper on the wall. Just place your order and find a table. You can see them cooking it in their small open kitchen.  Seating is somewhat sparse and there is an additional area out on the patio outside. Noticed a lot of people calling in their orders and picking them up once they were ready. This area definitely needed a place like this to pick things up a bit.  So far ... Ordered the Rib Eye Tacos on my first visit. They were perfectly cooked and were packed with flavor. Next tried the Mexican Hot Dog and the Torta Cubana. Very good and was too full afterwards for dessert. Today tried the Burrotote and some PapaNachos. Don't forget to check out the killer salsa bar with everything necessary to kick things up a notch.  Food is always very fresh and they use high quality ingredients. Been here several times and have not had a bad experience yet. Nice!  Too many cool things on the menu to list them all. How about fresh desserts made out of fruits, several kinds of flans, ice creams and yummy bakery treats to cap off the meal.  Service is very friendly and polite. Place is starting to get really busy and there can be small wait during peak hours. Did I tell you about the Soup of the Day? They will give you a sample to try while you wait.  Going to round up on this fine establishment. WOOHOO!  4.75 STARS",

As we were ordering the cashier hands us some cream of zucchini soup to try. It was a nice surprise and I have to say it was really good.  We ordered two plates of tacos the 1/2 Lb Ribeye (4 tacos $6.99) and the Pescado (3 tacos $7.49) Both plates came out nicely presented with a Grilled Mexican Onion, Blistered Chili, and Sauces. Everything was tasty and everything was fresh. They have a condiment bar and I really enjoyed adding the pickled onions to the Ribeye taco.  This place seems very solid.",

First time for me that the salsa hands down tasted better then the guacamole.  OMG I can't forget the soups.  If you are in the area this is a must go to.  It has a small eating area, beverages (I think beer) and sorbets/ice cream.  Nice, quaint, clean restaurant with plenty of parking.  Enjoy",

    "text": "I dont know what all the hype is about this place, I was not impressed.  I had the ribeye tacos as everyone seemed to rant and rave about. I cant do the same. The tacos were small and funny to say i had more avocado then meat? Most of the meat had so much fat i could have made 2 more tacos with it. I left hungry and ended up eating at another place. $15 and im still hungry? I dont think so.  The meat was not seasoned and had no taste to it. I mean the avocado sauce had more taste than my meat did. Thank god for limes and sauce otherwise i wouldnt have tasted anything. Im so disappointed because the pictures looked great, reviews were great but this was just simply a let down. I have my fair share of taco places that are cheaper and can totally kill this place, but who am i right?   I will never be back. They offered me a free scoop of ice cream if i showed them my review. I dont think they would wanna offer me free ice cream after seeing my review in a sea of good ones.. lol  But i have to be honest. This was a waste of money, i REALLY expected more.. Im extremely sad because it looks so good and its so close to my house.   Oh and be warned most of the pictures on yelp of the food, they do not have anymore. I didnt see a lot of the food shown on yelp on the menu and i kept asking the lady and showing her if they had it. Unfortunately almost every item she said they dont serve anymore.",

I did request queso fresco and it was free which is cool because that's usually an up charge. Overall, the staff was very friendly. The restaurant itself was small but really cute.

This place is a Order at the register and sit and wait for your meal.   Menu was small and a bit pricey, but I can understand produce can be expensive some times. However with the price comes quality...the taste was wonderful. Certainly taste fresh, this is nothing like chipotle where the food sits there. It was clean and the fact that they had roasted yellow chiles--captured my heart.   Their presentation was 5/5 starts. Like my boyfriend says, \"you eat with your eyes first\" and it looked delicious. I throughly enjoyed myself here and will be back again",

The place was very clean, I did not use the restrooms so I can not comment on those.  I am super picky about restrooms if a  place has dirty restrooms I will never go back. The cashier was very kind. She was Patience and explained me everything. There was a gentleman welcoming you and going table by table asking if everything was ok. Talk about service right? ...Great! Something makes me think he was the owner. They have Pan Dulce, and the basic street food as they promise on their advertisement. Also I loved the back sign on their shirts....\"We can not sell happiness but you can buy our Strawberries with cream which is pretty much  the same thing.\" I thought it was hilarious.....  I will definitely go back and will try the flautas.....  One recommendation...the containers by the salad bar are extremely little. You need bigger containers or zip-lock bags for take out orders. I took out my order and it was difficult to bring home  the delicious Cebolla curtida , pepinos and zanahorias, home.  Question...are dogs welcome to the patio sitting area? This area is full of pet lovers. If you allow them to bring them to the outside sitting area you might have more customers.....having a water container for the dogs is an marketing strategy  to  target pet lovers customers.  Congratulations and welcome to my neighborhood.",

    "text": "Oh, how I wanted to love this place . We always want to support the businesses in Slope.   On a positive note, the horchata was excellent - not too sweet. The also have a great looking menu with tortas, tacos and cool apps.   Unfortunately, the execution was horrible. We had to throw away both orders of elote (one of our favorite dishes). The corn was rubbery and SLATHERED in mayo. Also, no lime included. No lime with the elote? This was the very first time in my entire life I have had elote I didn't like. They need to send their cooks to Gallo Blanco to check out good elote.   After seeing their PapaNachos dish on Facebook, we also ordered that. The picture showed cheesy waffle fries with jalapenos. Yes please! Like the elote, they were extremely disappointing. No jalapenos - just cheez wiz on waffle fries. Boring, soggy and gross.   We didn't finish any of the 4 items we ordered and left extremely disappointed. I'm being nice giving it 2 stars. With so many good options around (Reyes, Gallo, etc), they are going to need to improve quickly to stick around.  Maybe their cooks need more training - not sure. I would skip this place for a bit until they get this figured out.",

My wife ordered the Vegetable Tacos made with a gluten-free shell from Jicama.  I ordered the Pescado (Fish) Tacos.  I must say, the food was AWESOME!  It was seasoned very well and the presentation was great.  My wife also tasted the Agua Fresca (Hibiscus) drink and loved it.    I ordered a slice of Cheesecake.

    "text": "\"Street food\" is my favorite kind of Mexican food. There's nothing more awesome than the cheap, simple, bite-sized tacos you buy at a roadside stand in Mexico or Tucson (an extension of Mexico). Phoenix has its share of roadside stands...but they ain't no Tucson or Mexico. Awesome dirty hole-in-the-wall places where employees don't speak English? Phoenix has tons, and they are great.  Tortas Paquime is a chain of five or so small restaurants focusing mainly on the torta. I didn't realize it growing up, but Mexicans know how to make an awesome sandwich. Honestly, the only sandwiches I get really excited about in any global cuisine is the torta. \"Street Food of Mexico\" is a new concept from Tortas Paquime - a clean, fast/casual restaurant that sells street tacos, tortas, aguas, and other offerings typically found at out of the way restaurants in low-rent buildings.  The food is really pretty good. I had the hot dog, which is not as good as the Sonoran hot dogs found in Tucson, but respectable in its own way, and the Rib Eye tacos. The tacos were simple enough that they can almost be considered real, bonified street tacos, with the meat being the main ingredient, and some avocado thrown in just to make it more awesome. Actually, they kind of straddle the line between street tacos and fancy tacos.  The cucumber agua is superb. They also had horchata and jamaica, and while I love me some horchata and jamaica, it's hard to pass up on cucumber agua. I never see that!  Paquime does sacrifice a little bit of authenticity so as to make white people feel a little more comfortable. There's not necessarily anything wrong with that - the spirit of Mexican street food is still alive in this food, even if it is served amid the bland, yuppie decor typically associated with worthless faux-Mexican schlock like Chipotle and Cafe Rio.  This is a quality addition to the Sunnyslope area. There are definitely better, more authentic Mexican places in the area, but this is not a bad concept at all, and it's executed pretty well.",

We tried the tacos(rib eye), burro(carne asade), torta and a burrito. Chips and salsa were ordered as well as a side of their corn.  Chips were among the best I've ever had in my life. Light, crispy and just salty enough. Salsas were really tasty and had varying degrees of heat to choose from.  I had the four tacos and they were ridiculously good. I was stuffed full but considered more just for the terrific flavor of them.   They had menudo and I was given a sample. It too was  superb. I grilled the guy at the counter and found everything, including the baked goods, were done in house. Picked up some treats for the kids and while they look great, I'm guessing they'll taste even better.",

DA fuck?!? My hand was right there.   When the cook brought my food, he was nice and smiled at me. A neighbor was eyeing my food and when our eyes met, he gave me the nod of approval. LoL  At first, the pork torta was wayyyyyy to salty. Than I had a bite with bread and it brought the saltiness down. With cucumbers and carrots, it turned out pretty good. The cucumber aqua was VERY delicious.  Will I be back? The rudeness of the young boy says NO. The food? Maybe.",

They do have bottle beers and margaritas. A lot of vegetarian options. I got vegetarian tacos and they are loaded with well seasoned and perfectly grilled vegetables. Lastly for low-carb eaters, you can replace tortilla with a thinly sliced jicama. It adds a really nice texture and slight sweetness /freshness. Worth a try. We will definitely be back",

    "text": "Paquime is actually a neat little concept, combining many traditional Mexican foods with items that are often not found in our mainstream Mexican restaurants here in Phoenix. And I'll openly admit, if I'm going to be buying some of this stuff, I feel much more comfortable obtaining it from a place that has to adhere to strict health codes as opposed to some shady looking dude on a trike near my place of employment.  Personally, I don't care what people say about \"authentic\" food. It doesn't always have to be consumed in a dirty restaurant with a non-working AC and clogged toilets. Paquime actually looks clean and modern, so I definitely don't have any complaints there.  Actually, my girlfriend and I dined here a year ago and had completely forgotten about it. I think we went in expecting something incredible, only to be a bit letdown by her soggy sopes. Nevertheless, I suggested that we give them another try after they keep popping up in my Yelp searches.  I ordered four tacos that they allowed me to mix up. Al pastor, barbacoa, carnitas, and bistec, which I guess is kinda/sorta like carne asada. Overall, the tacos were fine, but a bit of a mixed bag in terms of execution. My favorite was the barbacoa, which had surprisingly good flavor. The carnitas and bisect were both offensively cold for some reason, which is probably why I never found our first experience memorable.  My girlfriend ordered a Mexican hot dog, which I actually thought was pretty decent given that it was my first one. She claimed it was good, but obviously not the best she's ever had (which was probably obtained from one of the shady dudes I previously mentioned). We also ordered some esquite, which was okay, but a bit too watery and soupy for my tastes. It appeared that they were skimping on the actual corn itself, which is a big no-no.  Overall, I think Paquime is a place worth trying. They seem to be trying to cover a lot of different ground with their menu offerings. Probably a bit too much. But hey, they're getting great reviews, so they're obviously doing something right.   Recommended to try out.",

This spot reminds me of what you'd get in Mexico. Their staff is very friendly, most of them are also bilingual which I thought was pretty neat. They serve authentic street tacos. Their corn tortillas are fresh and they don't break apart as you eat your tacos. I had the pastor tacos and the pork was incredibly moist and flavorful. They put a thin slice of pineapple on the taco instead of the smaller bits you usually see, which ensures you get a little pineapple in every bite. The onions they put on top give it a nice little crunch and I also added their pickled onions from their salsa bar- which were phenomenal. Their salsa bar has everything you need to customize your tacos. They have merch available for purchase, beer, desserts, and many more options for tacos, tortas, tostados, nachos, and even breakfast.",

Overall first impressions were great - it's a nice clean modern space and I love that you can see the grill from up front as orders are prepared. There's also a salsa bar immediately when you walk in that has several options for all palates.   I was able to get my order in easily enough, but given that it wasn't all that busy, it took a while for my order to come out. There was only one cook on the line and one girl at the counter both taking orders and bringing food out.   The tacos I ordered were the pescado, bistec, and chicken and an horchata to wash it all down with. The bistec was a little bland and dry, which was a bit of a let down. The pescado and chicken tacos were alright, but not much about them stood out in terms of flavor. I will say that these tacos are reasonably priced. The horchata was alright - a touch too sweet but at least it wasn't excessively grainy as some places tend to make it.",

Not sure why, but we had an awful experiance. Was extremely disappointed with the staff, quality of the food and experience overall.  Family of six and no one enjoyed their meal and said we should have gone to Del Taco after eating here.   I ordered the ribeye tacos and they looked good, but the meat tasted awful, was super thin and cut up into very small chunks with a bad taste to it and even the tortilla tasted bad.  The fresh avocado was a nice touch, but this dish was a total fail!  My wife went with a mix of tacos. She said the barbacoa was very oily and could have used salt, chicken was very peppery and tasted like it came out of a bag and like be hated the ribeye.  The kids meals that come with a drink and side which is cool. We got quesadillas and unfortunately they were not good. The kids did not eat them and said they tasted bad. Sampling them to see what was up, my wife and I both agreed they were super super salty. $7 x 2 fail on the kids meals.  My son got $10 nachos with no sour cream.  Then when it came it had no beans and sour cream and when I told them that this was not what context (very politely) they argued with me and said I never said no sour cream and I said no beans. My son and I both were pretty clear at the register no sour and perhaps they heard no beans. The nachos were awful! The cheese wiz with peppery chicken that tasted like it was pulled out of a bag. The chips were very greasy and really did not work for nachos. This was an epic fail and I am very surprised this place has such good reviews considering everything we had was bad.",

    "text": "First stop in a quick search to find some food when I landed in Phoenix was here. Luckily we came here an hour before they closed so we got to eat their food. So right off the bat, saw that they had Pastor. Great. My go to. However, when I looked through their torta menu they didn't have a pastor torta. Luckily, when I got to the counter, the person who took my order hooked me up and got to add that as a torta. The torta itself was not big, however it was tasty and definitely packed a punch as far as the flavor profile. There was a nice kick to it as well which set apart from other pastor tortas I've had previously.  One thing that I have to say about this place was that the menu being displayed on a glass and then with a white background made it a little hard to read the prices and such. Everything seemed like it was a double unless you read it straight on. That was one problem that I found that maybe I just didn't agree with it.   This place is definitely a lunch spot or something really simple. I found that their salsa bar was really wide ranging and that there were a lot of options. I really like the simplicity of their modern design as well as their simplistic view. The staff was friendly and even though we came while they were cleaning up they happily filled our order and let us eat there as well. I definitely recommend to try this place if you're just looking for a low-key type of place and a quick meal.",

I ordered four tacos, two   pesacdo tacos (fish)  that came with tomatoes,onions/cilantro and a mayo type dressing and were full of flavor and two carnita tacos which were very tender and flavorful also with the cilantro/onion topping along with an horchata (which was so good and authentic tasting) and a mangodenada (mango gelato ice cream I believe with chamoy and tajin for the added flavor) . Although seating was kind of limited it was able to snatch a seat so I could enjoy my meal and let me tell you I wasn't at all disappointed. For the price of the food which was $18 it met all my expectations from the salsa and added onion and jalapeno. Given that it wasn't that packed at the moment I record my order rather quickly.",

The staff is always friendly and happy to make suggestions. They will even offer you a sample of their daily soups if you're interested (and trust me, you are).   Be patient while they make your food. It doesn't take too long, but the chef it making it fresh for you right there chopping and grilling it up. It takes longer than similar restaurants, but trust me, it's well worth the extra few minutes (like maybe 3 extra, be patient).  Since you have 3 extra minutes to kill, check out their little garnish bar -- salsa, avocado sauce, radishes, carrots. Everything a traditional taco stand would have! Pick a few to try.   The Paquime salad is gigantic. It's piled high in a nifty lookin' bowl. Beware, the dressing has a bit of a kick -- it's not so spicy you can't eat it, but the spice builds with each bite. But it is so tasty you probably won't be able to stop eating it anyway.   The street tacos are simple perfection. I've personally had the ribeye and their are flavorful and juicy. Add a little salsa, their avocado sauce, or a squirt of lime. I'm drooling all over my keyboard...  And when you are done get dessert. No better way than to end the meal with some of their amazing traditional Mexican desserts. But don't take my word for it, once you see the cakes, pastries, and ice cream there is no way you can pass them up.",

It comes with a side of liquid quacamole (probably more traditional), chipotle (think smoky flavor) salsa, a roasted poblano pepper, and a roasted shallot.    There is a salsa/pickled vegetable bar where you can grab different toppings for your food. I especially loved the pickled carrots and onions. The cucumbers were not pickled, but they were well marinated with oregano and vinegar.    We also started with some CHIPS AND GUAC/SALSA.Guac was filled with delicious ingredients (very chunky, like Chipotle's, but better).  I wasn't a huge fan of the salsa but it was certainly flavorful.    We took a generous portion of chocolate strawberry tres leches cake home. I'll dive into that after I run a few miles. :)  My only complaint?  I asked for my meat mediumand it came well done.  Can I please just have this every day for the rest of my life?",

    "text": "Paquime is clean, small, modern and the food is very good.   Of my friends who haven't been, they say it's over priced, boujee and not authentic...but they have also never been.  This is one of those places I hate to rate because it's a hidden gem and the amount of traffic in here has increased since I started checking in. When you order tacos they bring you 4, and when they ask you how you want your ribeye done. What they are really saying is \"this meat is coming straight from the cow\".   In addition they serve two smaller, divided burritos instead of a huge one. I love this because either feels like you're eating two or that you should save one and not eat so much.   I've recently started ordering the horchata which I rarely do because it's not milky enough but this one is perfect and I would describe it as \"nutty\".",

    "text": "I was craving some street tacos and always look at yelp for high star rating places, so this place had nearly 5 stars so you would think wow this place must be great! NO save your money and go elsewhere! Idk why they have such high ratings. I know why after eating there, the place is gentrified to the max, it is not \"authentic\" or nothing \"street\" about it. We had pastor, asada, and fish tacos. The pastor was greasy, no flavor, meat too too soft, it was just weird texture. The asada was okay, I mean how can you mess up asada right?? It just needed more seasoning. The fish tacos were also okay, they were just over fried, and the cream sauce was non existent, just a little squirt on top of the cabbage, maybe it was just for decoration. We also had Horchata and orange agua fresca. The Horchata had NO flavor it was bland to say the least, the orange was pretty good. After spending $40 I was pretty disappointed that the food was so whatever. At least the salsa was good. The service was okay, the girl taking orders didn't greet anyone and looked like she was over it. They had flan and ice cream but did not have any, they also have burritos, and quesadillas but also did not try them. I won't be going back especially since it was a 40 minute drive from where I live just to eat mediocre food.",

Also, the salsa that comes with the order of chips might be the best I've ever had. It has an incredible flavor and just the right amount of heat.   My only bad comment is there are not enough inside tables during the lunchtime rush. However, now that the weather is getting nicer outside, they have a great patio to enjoy.   Looking forward to many more visits at Paquime!",

I was skeptical at first but agreed to it when I saw they had a gluten-free veggie option for tacos. I was blown away. The taste was amazing thanks to the fresh ingredients. And the cost was fair - $9 for four quality tacos with a scoop of guacamole and veggies on the side.  Amazing.",

The menu offerings are not overly expansive but the food is done well and I attribute that to the copious amounts of vegetable oil that is used in the cooking. Carne is seasoned just right and is juicy and tender. Salsas have some complexity to them and I would venture to say are made in-house. There is seating inside as well as a small patio in the front. They also do ice cream and some pastries.",

I usually hit up Camelback road for some grub, but my belly was telling me to try something new, and I'm glad I did! Paquime is legit and reasonably priced. I love the pescado street tacos and their fruit popsicles. They have everything you would want in Mexican food and it is authentic. If you are having a sweet tooth, they have a pretty unique bakery as well! I am glad I found this place (:",

Authentic flavor and something different for a change.   When was the last time you were asked \"how would you like your steak done?\" For tacos no less! Ordered medium rare as it was a to-go. Sadly, I took a little peek at the 4-some, and they didn't make past the parking lot exit, devoured. Mucho sabor!   Try everything. Whoever owns this place, knows what they're doing.  Probably one of the best Mexi's around. Worth a trip.",

    "text": "No breakfast all day, sadly!  They stop at noon, so chorizo also becomes unavailable.  The employees were very nice about it though, especially the goateed gentleman who seemed like the supervisor/manager.  The lovely Mexican pastries that greet you are very affordable, though the flan is a touch expensive at $4/$3 (depending on the type).  My fish quesadilla was somewhat small, about the size of a Taco Bell one.  It was beautifully crispy with good flavors and actual texture, but was also $7.50.  It came with a small scoop of guacamole on the side.  My large slice of cheesecake from the pastry case was 99 cents, and had a very light texture.  The yellow cake like top layer gave it a good chew, and it was very creamy too.  I ate the entire thing, and I feel it balanced out the slightly small quesadilla in terms of overall value.  Atmosphere is okay, with wood and brick.  I can see why people are comparing it to Chipotle.  I definitely appreciate that they're trying.  The restroom was very nice and clean!  There was a strange chemical or burning rubber smell in the air when they were grilling something though.  Very unpleasant.  It was interesting to note they had a pretty strong Caucasian clientele coming in while I ate, so hopefully they will stay part of the neighborhood.  One of the employees started cleaning the glass right behind me just now and the Windex smell is really awful.  I'm going to be slightly generous with my stars and boost them up to 4, since they're a solid 3.5 and I really appreciate a slightly more upscale (clean, new) \"fast casual\" restaurant choice in the neighborhood.  Their dessert choices (pastry, cut fruit, ice cream, popsicles) really help set them apart from the competition.",

My girlfriend and I drove all the way down just for this and we couldn't even finish it. Literally left a bad taste in our mouths.

    "text": "I stopped in because I saw on yelp that they served elote, - usually a delicious ear of corn slathered in mayonnaise, rolled in cojita cheese and sprinkled with chili powder and lime juice. I was terribly disappointed when they brought to my table a paper cup filled with a cloudy liquid and a glob of mayo floating in it. When I questioned him, he said that they no longer serve the corn on the cob. Now they serve a small cup with a little bit of corn kernels at the bottom, and the rest of the cup filled with cloudy water, with a glob of mayo and a little bit of crumbled cojita cheese. It wasn't good.   The tacos however were great!  The ribeye tacos were simple but delicious. diced ribeye, cabbage and a slice of avocado on a small corn tortilla. The Volteado taco was especially wonderful. A  small corn tortilla topped with a little heap of a wonderfully flavored pork and a slice of cheese, then the whole thing is flipped over face down on the grill so the cheese gets crispy and toasty, then topped with an avocado slice.   The red hot sauce at the little salsa station was exceptional as well. it was really spicy and velvety smooth, It was even kind of creamy. Judging by the creaminess and richness of it, I'm pretty sure it has some heavy cream in it.  The rich salsa paired with the simple clean tacos made for an amazing meal.  After my meal I bought a churro from the pastry case. It wasn't good. It tasted old and was really tough and chewy.   Oh! And when I first walked it, the girl at the counter gave me a sample of the soup of the day. It was cream of zucchini, which sounds kind of weird, but it was great as well. it was creamy and rich with corn and bacon in it. I wasn't in the mood for soup but it was definitely delicious. Service was friendly too.  I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the weird corn water and old churro, but it was an overall good experience. I would highly recommend the Volteado tacos and Paquime in general.",

Last Sunday (Sunday September 25, 2016) I tried to call my order in but no one answered.  I checked their hours and yup, they're supposed to be open.  I had to drive by on my way somewhere else so I stopped by but 30 minutes after they're opening time the doors were locked and they still weren't open.    A young lady comes to the doors and says, \"We need 10 more minutes to open.  He's not ready yet.\"  So I wait and when I get my order, it's all wrong.    I gave Paquime plenty of chances because I liked the menu but have lost my patience for people who don't respect customers enough to provide good customer service.",

Clean, very bright from big walls of glass facing the street and parking area, and simply but very tastefully decorated, this eatery serves upgraded versions of popular Mexican street foods: tacos, sonoran hotdogs, tortas, burritos, etc. The hot soups are really welcome on cold - and even not so cold - days, and there are ample desserts such as flans and cakes to satisfy any cravings for sweets. Good prices and very friendly service, though some items such as papanachos or elote en vaso (you have to ask for this; it was not in the menu during my last visit) may take a bit of time to prepare.",

    "text": "Paquime is the epicenter of the Sunnyslope Sunday Breakfast dilemma. Next door is the coffeehouse that has better coffee and the Blueberry Spiral Rolls of Delight. But Paquime has three weapons to suck a really hungry person in:  1. Breakfast tortas! The chorizo breakfast torta is pretty much the best breakfast idea in the universe, beating out now-familiar breakfast burritos. It has chorizo and maybe beans and definitely peppers, and it will make smoke come out your ears.  2. Full menu served at breakfast time. So if you need fish tacos at 9 a.m., you can have fish tacos at 9 a.m. (There is also menudo on Sundays.)  3. Best Mexican pastries I've ever had. I'd gotten a little jaded on the Mexican-pastry front, but these are fresh! And huge!   Now, the reason you want to go here, rather than to the much divier -bertos across the parking lot is that both the food and the environment are rather more chi-chi (while still being quite affordable). All things -berto's are for when you want a honkin' big burrito on a foam plate, with a plastic fork, before you go to Lowe's (or after a long night at the bars). Such moments exist, and they are real.  Paquime is for when you want a quietly civilized meal, with quality ingredients, on real plates, but the prospect of hauling yourself to Gallo Blanco is too onerous, expensive, and precious to contemplate. They also do take-out, should you prefer your civility at home but not want to fire up the skillet.",

    "text": "The food tasted amazing!   The interior of the place is very modern, clean, and hip! They have a nice donut/pastry display right when you walk in. Good strategy from the owner since that makes people like us who come in, think about maybe saving some room for some sweets after! They serve tacos, sopes, elotes, to flan, aguas frescas(which includes: horchata, cucumber, and Melon flavor) and ice cream just to name a few! A place where you can get everything just in one place if you don't wanna drive out to get dessert.  What me and my sisters ordered: -Flan Napolitano -Ribeye tacos(medium rare) -Barbacoa tacos -Carnitas Tacos -Horchata -Cucumber drink  Right when we ordered, I've been eye balling their flan and I asked the guy at the register if it was good and he said that it was his fave, so I had to get it and try!   All the tacos that we ordered were very tasty and yummy! Even the presentation was beautifully done! Each taco plate comes with 4 tacos, a whole grilled green onion, and a cooked yellow jalapeno pepper served with green and red hot sauce on the side. For me, I am a very detailed oriented person, so I take into consideration of little things like that! Even my sisters were telling me to make sure to eat the grilled green onion as well since it was tasty(make sure to dip it into hot sauce for some extra flavor)!  There is also a side bar of condiments(carrots/cucumber/red onions/lemon etc.) which is unlimited to cater to your taco needs! =)  The drinks tasted very authentic! I especially love the cucumber drink! Not too sweet, but juuuusssssttt rigghhht. Oh yeaaaa, just how I like it!  Even entering upon the women's restroom, it was very clean! I know this might sound weird, but I like the picture that is hung inside the lady's room! =X It's an elder lady in the picture selling elotes which is my all time favorite Hispanic treats!!!! Mm mm mm good!  At the end, I saved the flan for last, and MY GOD!!!! The first bite, I literally just died and was reincarnated! I swear that first bite was love at first taste! My sisters looked at me weird when they heard my crazy commotion and wanted to try as well and they agreed with me but not too wildly crazy as I was, but they did the, \"mmmm omg this IS REALLY GOOD!\"  Overall, me and my sister/friend wanted to come back here before we go back home to CA but didn't get a chance to since it would've been out of the way, but when I do come back to AZ to visit my sister, I will for sure come back here to try more! =)",

    "text": "Paquime is located just south of the hospital in Sunnyslope. And it is definitely worth putting in your rotation.   It is a order at the counter and sit down joint like 90% of today's new restaurants but the difference is the chef will actually bring you out your food. It is relatively small inside but there is a little patio as well.   The food is the best part. The cream of zucchini is amazing!  Excellent flavor and little pieces of zucchini and corn. So so tasty.   The Flautas were topped with an avacado salsa, tomatoes, cucumber, lettuce, cotija cheese, and radishes. Basically a salad on the side.   The carne asada burro was also done right. The meat was fresh and well seasoned. The burro had beans and avacado as well.  Everything here was made fresh and taken an extra couple steps from your average place. There is also a salsa/condiment bar that is excellent.  Some places have 20 salsas that are all mediocre.  Paquime has three that are delicious.  The avacado salsa is amazing.  The arbol salsa is savory and spicy.  The verde salsa is also spicy and fresh.    I will be back and recommend you try.",

    "text": "My wife and I moved here at the end of August 2015. Before we relocated I started using Yelp to bookmark the places I thought would be good, Paquime Street Foods was one of the first and we have been eating here 2-3 times a week ever since, why? Because it really is authentic street foods of Mexico, except that the restaurant is sooooo clean and the people that work there are so professional and neat that its actually better than eating at a taco, torta or antojitos cart in the dusty Mexico streets, I can say that because I was born there, and plus its True.  Our favories so far have been the potatoe and cheese soup on fridays (get there early cuz it runs out), it tastes just like the one my nana and mom make, the only thing I would add would be some corn kernels. The rib eye tacos are way better tasting than any taco I have had in phoenix and taste as good or better than any taqueria in Mex., get em on flour tortillas. And my wife loves their tostadas and flautas, her favorite are the shredded beef ones. Weve also had their pozole, their broccoli soup is the best one ive ever had and i like to add a bit of Tapatio sauce to mine. We love their pork tortas, breakfast tortas and mexican hot dogs. For dessert, their pan dulce is so soft and sweet and one of the best crafted breads ive had, their flan is one of our favorite and their esquimales are also bigger and better tasting than the paleteros on the street in Mex.  In conclusion, this place is too legit, and we will continue to eat there regularly as long as they keep serving great food in this extremely clean and inviting environment.",

I hope they fix this place... -------------------------------------------  Wow. I can't believe how great this place is! From the second we got in the door, the staff greeted us and made us feel so welcome! They could tell we were new and offered us samples of their sopa  de dia. It was simply put: AMAZING! And I'm not a soup person. Soup is for old people and I never order it. But this was so good I got some to go.   I recommend the fish tacos  and the ribeye  And my fiance said the veggie tacos were surprisingly flavorful.   For dessert they have a frozen mango with chili and lime that tastes better then you get in mexico. For real!  Can't believe this place isn't packed 24/7",

We were hungry, but not 'starving'...so we didn't want a heavy, cheese-laden plate with rice and beans.  I like a \"little of this and little of that\" so we ordered two different kinds of tacos, since they come 4 (of the same kind) to a plate. They are perfect little street tacos and made fresh to order, so don't expect your order in 2 minutes.  Fresh grilled accompaniments are included on the plate... a yummm mild pepper and grilled green onion. They also have the salsa bar, it also has the grilled peppers, pickled parrots and jalapenos, 3 different salsas, pickled red onions, limes... just good, fresh stuff.  We got the al pastor and fish tacos.  Both my husband and I agreed, they were tasty...full of flavor and freshly made.  We'll be back and we are looking forward to trying other menu items.  On the way out we smiled and said it was our first time in and that we would return.  The cook over-heared and pridefully smiled and said 'excellente?!'  Yes... excellente!",

    "text": "Had to give this place a go after seeing it today while out and then reading the posts. Dragged my husband down to Sunnyslope to check it out and was really glad we did. This is a fast casual restaurant with rather limited seating, BUT the food was really fresh and delicious.  We were given a sample of the lentil soup (different soup each day) to try and that was the kickstart of what was to come. The soup was homey and savory with the lentil cooked to the point that there was still some toothsomeness but were creamy. I would go back for the soup alone.  We also ordered the esquites, fish tacos, and rib eye tacos. Everything was freshly prepared and brought to us. I was confused by the term that the corn is shaved, but it really just meant it was not on the cob. The esquites could do with less liquid in the bottom of the cup, but the cotija was briny/salty good and the hot sauce provided a nice contrast. The portion could easily feed two.  As for the tacos, I might have been very content with the rib eye tacos had I not sampled the fish tacos. Those fish tacos were fabulous- crunchy, flaky with a great chipotle crema. Loved that. The rib eye tacos had generous portions of steak, were topped with creamy avocado slices and came with a chipotle sauce and avocado sauce. After tasting the sauce that came with the fish tacos, I was dunking there. That sauce had a little heat and some tang that was excellent.  Unfortunately, we did not have room for dessert so I cannot comment on that. I will say that the service was good, the place is clean, and the food we had was freshly prepared and flavorful. The menu is more extensive than you might think and we will definitely be back.  **Please note, this place really is not like Chipotle. It is MUCH better than Chipotle. I hope they branch out further north but in the meantime, I will make the drive.",

You order at the counter and they have several offerings including: sopes, tacos and tortas. I had the torta ahogada and my wife had the sopes; both tasted fantastic and the price point was great. We finished off with the tres leches cake which was equally great. I will definitely return,",

They have a fixins bar with various pickled items, salsas, and limes.  I recommend the pickled onions, and the green salsa is very good too.  A great value, being that we often spend more at taco bell which isn't even in the same realm as this place.  Everything was made to order and very fresh. Next time, I will definitely have to try the amazing desserts they offer which included homemade popsicles, ice cream, pastries, and cakes, they looked sooooo good!",

Walked up on a Saturday morning around 11... greeted by the sound of... is that Bret Michaels singing \"every rose has it's thorn?\" on the loudspeakers.  Took away from the \"street food cred\" immediately for me.  Walking in you see a nice display of baked sweets in a glass display case.   Mine was a little dry but nice.  Service was extremely prompt and friendly throughout the experience, if even a little over eager?  As I waited for my meal, I looked at the black and white pictures of old school Mexican street eats, and Bret Michaels turned into Journey, then REO Speedwagon, only to be topped by Peter Cetera and Cindy Lauper.  Not sure what Mexican street these guys played on.  My lunch came on house baked bread which was very nice, potato chips were homemade and excellent.  Salsa bar has limes and cool cucumbers which contrasted nicely with the appropriate heat in my Torta Huevo con Chorizo.  I sat at 2 tables and all chairs, most tables and corners of floors were covered in crumbs.  I was the only one in the restaurant.  The first table was cleaned off quickly for me.  I am mixed on this place.  The ambiance was disappointing but the food was very good.  I guess... wait for it... every rose has its thorn?  Barump.",
