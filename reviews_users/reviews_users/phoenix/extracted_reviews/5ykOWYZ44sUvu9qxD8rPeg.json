Our original plan was Romo, but the 1-1/2 hour wait deterred us and we found Il Bosco and what a find it was! The atmosphere was comfortable and casual. The owner was very attentive with a great sense of humor. All good, but nothing compared to the quality of the food. From the delicious olives and bread with seasoned olive oil that got us started, to the fresh salad and finally to four of the best pizzas! We tried white and red; all had perfectly thin crusts with the right amount of dough around the edge and each was topped with wonderfully fresh cheese or other inventive ingredients. Exquisite!  The party didn't end there - we finished off with lemon sorbetto which just perfect and the youngest members of our group had the stamina for the pumpkin brownie.  We all decided when we left dinner that this place was going to get a return visit on our next business trip.",

MOST of those places that make brick oven pizza are too thin, the sauce bleeds thru in minutes and does not reheat well. This place has the best pizza of this kind I have had.  Not thin in the middle, amazing quality cheese!  Also got the meatball appetizer. 3 meatballs with marinana sauce, easily the best meatballs I have ever had. Not over seasoned or weird tasting.",

He took it to box it up. Finally when we paid and were wanting to leave we asked for our box and it turns out the food got thrown out instead of boxed up. No big deal since it was just 1 slice but if it had been more we definitely would have asked for another pizza to replace it.",

I was greeted at the door by the owner/ Bill Forrest.  I received nothing but wonderful hospitality throughout my dining experience from both Bill and Barbara as well as some entertaining dialog with the kitchen team (a penquin tattoo, really?). The wine list was well thought out with very reasonable by the glass and bottle prices.  The menu selection was focused.  By that I mean, it stayed True to what they do and they do it well.  Too often you find the restaurant that wants to be everything to everybody.  Not here.  They do pizza very well.  I have traveled to Italy many times in my career and this place nails it.  Great dough coupled with the finest of ingredients, prepared in a minimalist style that lets the food do the talking.  I am truly impressed.  I will be back often.  I hope for Bill and Barbara that this is a hit but deep down I love the hidden gem.   If you are a foodie and love food without pretense, you will love Il Bosco.  This is a foodie find.  I am a chef and I absolutely love this place.  You will not be disappointed.   Cheers,",

    "text": "I've had Bosco's bookmarked for a few years and never had a chance to try this place. Decided to give this place a go today and boy have I really missed out on a really good place. Shame shame on me.   It's a small place that is somewhat hidden but we had no problem finding it. They have a decent amount of outdoor seating but indoor is quite small. About seven or eight tables. Very homie with a long wooden bench on one side with throw pillows all over the bench making it very homie. Most of the tables are two people tables but they do push the tables together for bigger parties. They also have an open kitchen. I think it's has a really nice ambiance. Somewhat loud cause everyone's enjoying their food.   Well, we were started off with some tasty olives and sour dough bread which I thought was really good. Olives weren't to sour and very tasty. We ordered the Roasted Seasonal Vegetables with Burrata. Today's veggies were Brussel Sprouts. My favorite. Very fresh and really tasty. Really loved it. The Burrata was lite and really went well with the Brussel sprouts. Really good dish.   Next, we got the Lucia pizza which had sausage and mushrooms. My wife was a little worried it was going to be salty but it wasn't. Sausage was fresh and really good. Mushrooms were really fresh. All the ingredients were really fresh. It was a good sized pizza and the crust. I enjoyed the crust. It was not too thin and not to thick. A little chewy but everything came together. It was a really good pizza. Probably the best I've had on this side of town.   For dessert, they have so many choices and the owner recommended the Lemon Sorbetto. It had lemon sorbet in a real lemon frozen. I was really surprised. Very light. Not to bitter. Very refreshing. Really good.   So we came to Bosco's on a Friday night but pretty early. We beat the crowd. Our server greeted us quickly and brought us water and our own bottle. There were at least three or four different people serving us and making sure everything was okay. Excellent service. Friendly service which followed the homie feeling inside.   I would say I really enjoyed our whole meal at Bosco's. Great food. Fresh food. Really good service with a wonderful ambience. The prices were even reasonable. All I can say is I can't wait to come back. They have speciality pizzas on the board and can't wait to try them plus their desserts. Need I say more.  Enjoy.",

The mushrooms were small and quartered, which really added to their flavor. I got the Adrianna pizza with tomato sauce, cheese, and chiffonade basil. Both pizza's were delicious and the crust is to die for! We'd never had such wonderful crust on a brick oven pizza. It was crispy and chewy, absolutely perfect! I had the lemon sorbeto for dessert and it was wonderful! We will definitely be back to this wonderful pizza joint.",

The fresh dough and custom high heat oven makes a perfect combination for a browned crust.  I must say my favorite pizza pepperoni, sausage and olive.  Appetizer was a Caprese  cheese and tomatoes which just is out of this world. We also had some cooked red peppers to die for.  Service was quick yet a nice dining experience with friends.  Two thumbs up! #bestPizza",

For meat lovers, the pizza can be topped with lots of meat choices--and they top with a good amount. Definitely a local staple.",

There's a darling patio with heaters in the cool months; the indoor dining space is rather small, but it's part of the charm.   If you're not making reservations (only taken for parties of 6 or more) you might have a little wait, but not to fear - you can have an Italian beer or nice glass of wine at the bar, and you'll probably make friends with the regulars sitting to your left...and right. This place is popular, and for good reason. The quality is unparalleled, and yet the owner is as humble as can be. Tonight I watched a Postmates guy wait for the pizzas he was delivering. The staff made him at home with some ice water and a dish of their signature olives; how very charming, I thought.",

The timing of delivering the pizza to our table was great as was the consistency - no soggy middle like you get other places. The proprietor was friendly and helped us make good choices. The spot is cozy and their brick oven catering looks phenomenal.",

    "text": "Il bosco reminded me of a pizza place on lago lugano in switzerland.  The owner is very laid back and generous; he even bought me a \"campari\" soda.  It's obvious he has a lot of passion in his restaurant.  The ambiance is intimate and the staff is attentive and on their game.  The flavor from the wood fire oven was as expected.  The pizza dough was over kneaded...also, if the portion of bread/crust was less I think I would have been more pleased.  The ingredients seemed fresh but average quality.  The amount of cheese and sauce was perfect though...  I'm honestly unsure if I'll return.  My expectations were higher.  Still, give it a try if you want a decent pizza with great service and atmosphere!",

We were asking the owner a ton of questions about the place, food, etc and he was very generous with his time. The pizzas were really good, sausage good, cheese was yummy. The bread, also made from the pizza dough was nice and crusty with a chewy center. The caprese salad was grape tomatoes with fresh mozzarella and a nice surprise, burrata. Very fresh and good.  He grows his own herbs too.  This is a must try!",

We are TOUGH pizza critics and this place is now on the top of the list. Going back for 2nd time in a week. Female server was very easy going and pleasant. Whole thing was totally relaxed and delicious. Owner present and engaged.  Will up this rating to a 5 if it's as great again...... AND if no one takes the offensive-smelling garbage out during our meal and stinks up the whole place. It's a good thing we were finished eating, because if we hadn't been, we would have had to abandon the meal. Poor staff judgement to do that. Poor management judgement to leave the trash long enough to smell that bad and to not clean the bin.",

I came here with high expectations, and I was with my family. The kids wanted ice cream, the waiter recommended us a lemon sorbet but did not state the price, and since the menu lists a sorbet a certain price we thought it would be the same price we would be charged. Turns out, they were very misleading (minus one star) and we were charged almost 2x as much..I believe it was $7 for half a lemon sized sorbet! Outrageous, esp when we got three of them! Total of three of the sorbets cost the same as one pizza. Pizza is overpriced also, esp since their toppings aren't that much. Disappointed as they did not meet the expectations as I thought they would based on the yelp review.",

    "text": "This is the best pizza in Phoenix, no contest.  I've eaten at pizzeria Bianco many times and I will be moving my business to Il Bosco. You can read my review on Grimaldi's and how i stated it was missing something,  well Il Bosco has the \"it\" factor.  My wife and I dined here tonight and it was just a great, refreshing experience.  The place is on the smaller side, we sat outside which was great.  The menu is very limited but everything on it looked fantastic.  We opted for the Biaggia which consisted of prosciutto, arugula, a fig sauce, a squeeze of citrus, parmesan shavings and goat cheese. The other pizza we split was the special Zita. This was a white pizza with meatballs and carmelized onions.  Both pizzas were phenomenal.  The flour they use is organic so the pizzas are super light and do not sit heavy at all.  The service is also fantastic as both our waiter and the owner checked on us multiple times and were very informative.  Also, the pizzas came out extremely fast, like less than 5 minutes fast. I can't rave about this place enough, it's worth going out of your way for. .",

Tasted just like ice cream you'll get from the grocery store - in fact grocery store ice cream is better.   We all had a serving of mediocre food, followed by more of the same in the desert department. Oh, and it was all topped of with a healthy dose of service reeking of attitude.  Maybe our experience was an anomaly, but it was bad enough to dissuade us from any future visits.",

We came on a cool rainy night and sat at the bar, right in front of the wood-fired oven, and the owner made friendly conversation with us the whole time.  We split the Biaggia (prosciutto, goat cheese, fig spread, EVOO) and the Dona (mozzarella, pancetta, roma tomatoes, parmesan, and tomato sauce). The crust was perfectly chewy and had a slightly sweet flavor, which I love. The toppings were fresh and high-quality. I just wish we had more room, because we also really wanted to order the egg and pancetta pizza. Next time... and there will be a next time!!!",

    "text": "We were starving and wandering around Scottsdale Quarter, so we decided to pop into True Food to eat. In spite of there being lots of open tables, they said there would be an epic wait - or we could sit with some strangers or on a sofa outside. I didn't feel like doing either of those things, so we split and headed south. I used yelp to find the best place that was still open and on the way.   Il Bosco showed up with the best overall score, and neither of us had eaten here so we decided to give it a shot. It's tucked away in a little nook next to Handlebar J's and looked cute and inviting. We wandered in and were seated right away. It's a cozy little place - clearly decorated with care and love.  We both ordered water (sparkling and still) and they came in these fancy artisan bottles that were left at our table along with a pair of small glasses filled with ice. I like when restaurants do this. They also brought out a tiny strange plate with olives on it. Neither of us eat olives, so we sorta poked at them, puzzled over them and dared each other to eat one.   The menu was elegant and beautiful - simple and hand written. We later got an explanation from the owner that he had a local artist make them by hand. Details details... this place is rich in details. The items on the menu were pretty much just salads and pizzas.   Everything about this place says \"fancy fine-dining\" and if I hadn't looked at the prices I would've thought it was going to be too rich for my blood. As it turns out, the prices were VERY reasonable. The only thing I thought was a little pricey was the water - on any other night I would've ordered wine though, and the wine prices were appropriate.   We ordered a pizza (half and half - something you can do as long as the sauces match) and a caesar salad. They brought some artisan bread with herb oil for us to snack on, and we made that disappear. The salad was split into two plates and we quickly ate that up as well - it wasn't drowning in dressing. It was an excellent presentation and a good salad.   The pizza then arrived... it was about a 10-12\" woodfired pizza. My half was pepperoni and sausage. Her half was just cheese. Each half had a name on the menu - girls names if I remember correctly. We each took a piece over to our plates and started digging in. Right off the bat, I noticed how rich and creamy the cheese was. The pepperoni was light and had a perfect amount of spice behind it. The sauce was flavorful. The most notable part was the crust though - light, crisp, airy, and delicate.   We both cleaned our plates - the only things we left behind were the olives. We also ordered a dessert - creme brule - it was one of the best I've ever had. We were both full, but we didn't feel like we needed to be wheeled out to the car in a cart. It was the perfect amount of food. It was also pretty inexpensive for what you get. This is high quality fine dining with great atmosphere and attentive staff. This is a new date-night spot for me. It's also inexpensive enough to make it a regular spot.  Had a chat with the owner who was waiting on us most of the night, and he seems like a great guy. We could tell that he loved his business. I like supporting local businesses, and this 5 star review is one of the most deserved that I've ever given.",

The menu has pizza, salads, two appetizers, and two desserts.  They have a wood fired pizza oven, which gives their pizza the perfect crust. They do have beer and wine, although a limited selection.  I ordered the Joanna Pizza - pepperoni, sausage, cheese and tomatoes, and had them add onions. It was delicious, one of the best pizza's I have tasted.  I was going to give it a four star rating, but had several pieces left over, which I took home for breakfast the next day.  Wow!! It is the only pizza I have had that actually tasted better the day after!! That in and of itself, bumps them up to a five star rating.  Another plus is their prices are very, very reasonable.

    "text": "I think I may have discovered pizza nirvana.   I am a firm believer that a restaurant should pick something- and do it well. Il Bosco embodies this philosophy completely. The place is small and cozy, with a warm, rustic environment. The menu is simple with very few options- which I appreciate. It's even written by hand by an Italian calligrapher (then copied, but still!)   We were immediately served a small plate of olives upon being seated. I hate olives, but I appreciated the sentiment! I even worked up the nerve to try one, but it just confirmed that I do, in fact, still hate olives. The homemade bread and seasoned olive oil that followed was fantastic though.  My beverage of choice was sparkling water, which even that is made in house! It was served in a pretty glass bottle, tastefully etched with their logo. It was a little spendy at $4, but it was nice to have the bottle at the table to refill my cup as needed. The drink really was the only thing that was a little high priced, the pizza and appetizers were VERY reasonable- low even.  I opted for a plain cheese pizza with red sauce and basil. I had sort of high expectations after seeing that this place only had 5 star reviews, but even still I wasn't disappointed. I've had wood fired pizza at a number of places in Arizona, and this one really stands out to me. I think I could safely say that this is my favorite pizza in the valley. The crust is perfect. Not too fluffy, not too thin. Crispy parts, with doughy bubbles that are chewy in the center. The sauce was the perfect balance of savory and sweet, and I could taste a hint of red wine. The cheese was out of this world. I actually meant to ask the owner (who was waiting on us) about what made the cheese so fantastic. I will next time for sure.   They knew my dessert weakness, and had creme brulee with berries on the menu. I couldn't resist. I went against the owner's recommendation of the Lemon dessert, and I'm glad I did. The creme brulee was amazing, and each berry on top was ripe and sweet.  Seriously, I have no complaints about this place. It was a great date night dinner and I enjoyed my experience from start to finish. I can't wait to go back!",

Well-crafted za, and baked by a guy watching the flecks of dough cook to perfection.  Their idea of perfection looks a little dark, so you should like a slight charring.  The prosciutto ingredient is the real thing.  The crust is lean.  It seems like flour, water, yeast, salt - no or little shortening.  This is not the golden pie where your hand comes away greasy after grabbing a slice.  Excellent salad - fresh romaine, good sharp cheese.  If you don't like a healthy dose of dressing ask for them to lighten up, but the caesar - it's tasty!  Interesting selection of italian wines at $8-10 for a small-med pour.  This is an artisan's pizza and deserves a try to round out the rich, cheesy pies that are found elsewhere.",

Great job guys!!!",

    "text": "Mouthwatering cuisine really can come in a small package and Il Bosco is here to prove that size definitely does not matter! I met the lovely Anna M for lunch recently and much to my delight, she introduced me to Il Bosco.   Hidden down an alley on the north west corner of Shea and Scottsdale Road, Il Bosco is a humble abode filled with a whole lot of flavor. The restaurant itself is tiny and probably only hold around 50-60 people. Upon walking in, I was immediately greeted by the scent of pizza baking in the wood fired oven and a feeling of hominess with dark wood and brick paneling and close seating. You know those restaurants where they offer you an \"eating in the kitchen\" experience and make you make a reservation months in advance for the chance to \"dine with the chef\" Well here, you get to do so every time you visit because the open kitchen is just steps away from the seating. Therefore you get to see the pizza being created from scratch and here's the best part of the entire experience...the pizza cooks in 90 seconds! Yes 90 seconds!   I ordered the Biaggia which comes with prosciutto, figs, four cheeses, arugala and evo. The lunch pizzas are personal pizzas so Anna ordered the Lucia which comes with cheese, tomato sauce, sausage and mushrooms. I could smell the pizza being made and I started to drool with anticipation. Finally a whole 90 seconds later, poof! The pizza appeared and I took my first heavenly bite which turned into many more heavenly bites. This pizza is some of the best pizza I've ever had and I have had my fair share of pizza! The crust is a combination of crunchy and chewy and it's seasoned to perfection. The toppings are a perfect combination of sweet and savory and compliment the crust perfectly. I must say that the Biaggia was by far the most superb pizza I've had in quite some time. The Lucia was also extremely good but the Biaggia stole poor Lucia's thunder. It was a delicious lunch and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It's one of the best kept secrets around but I don't think it should be a secret. Everyone should experience this pizza!   I will leave you with one more little fun fact. They have a portable wood fired oven that they use for catering! It's amazing and would be great for a party. I also noticed that they have a walk-up window where you can order take-out.",

This actually turned into a charming experience. We talked to the owner for a while and he told us the story of how he got his start.   He served us himself, and the food was fantastic! Super fresh, and we got to watch them make our pizza in the brick oven! We ordered the Biaggia pizza off the lunch menu, and it was topped with figs, prosciutto, cheese and arugula. Totally excellent combo! The Bistecca sandwich, with steak and mushrooms, was also good. Menu items were simple but fresh and clearly from high quality ingredients. I loved talking to the owner as well, it seems like this whole place was made with love!",

We shared the kale and spinach and caprese salads before sampling a few of the specials pizza and my favorite, the Biaggia.

    "text": "I wandered in here last week, late on a Friday evening, and found the place almost deserted.  Bill greeted me at the door, I asked if I could have a meal, and he sat me down at the bar.  Almost immediately I was impressed by the hospitality.  I looked at the menu, which is just a sheet of paper with drinks on one side, and pizzas, salads, desserts, and antipasti on the other, and found it promising.  Why?  Not because it was extensive, but rather because it was limited.  I like a place that just does a couple of things, and does those things well.  Each day there is a different pizza of the day, salad of the day, and I think antipasti of the day.  My first visit, I went with a split pizza--half Maria (pesto, garlic, and tomato) and half Biaggia (prosciutto, goat cheese, fig, maybe something else)--along with a Boylan's root beer.  The root beer turned out to actually be a Boylan's Creamy Red Birch Beer (Bill said he promises his customers this is the best root beer they'll ever have.  It's partially True, in that it's better than many root beers, but it's technically not a root beer. Get it anyways.), which was actually a nice surprise. (Boylan's Birch Beer would be even better...)  I liked the Maria, but I LOVED the Biaggia.  This was a very good pie, and based on the other reviews here, it possibly could be considered their signature pie.  On my second visit, a week later, I had the Dona, a red pizza with tomatoes and pancetta.  The pancetta was nice and crispy, and of course, delicious.  They also serve you olives while you wait; these were some of the best olives I've had.  I couldn't stop eating them.  They actually tasted fresh (well...as fresh as an olive can get, considering you have to basically wipe out their original bitter flavor when you cure them).  The best part about this restaurant is that it has the feel of a small neighborhood restaurant.  It gets busy during the dinner rush, but if you come a little later, it'll be more relaxed, and you can actually strike up a conversation with the staff.  Good pie, excellent establishment.",

Now had this been a server who hated his job, I could've shrugged it off but this man was the OWNER. Then after I enjoyed it enough to order a glass, he forgot to bring it to me (we were one of two tables on a Tuesday night). This is why I'm giving three stars instead of four, possibly five. You can't skip out excellent service just because you have excellent food (which Il Bosco truly does) and the owner of the establishment should know this and provide this and if he can't, he should hire someone who can.",

Bill made the process so easy and their catering prices are fantastic. My guests LOVED pizza at the wedding. Who wouldn't like fresh pizza at a wedding?! With the pizza oven parked in my driveway, they did passed appetizers, salad, pizza, and cannoli for desert. This was the best decision I made for my wedding.

If you want the best, go to Pomo in Phoenix, Piazza al Forno in Glendale, and maybe Bianco.  The owner didn't think I was legit when I walked in. I came in for a late lunch, as usual, well after 1:00. It was quiet, might have had the whole place to myself. When I walked in, the owner did some kind of read on me and pegged me as someone who might be looking for a random pizza place, might not appreciate the kind of primo place this was. Picture a Mexican dude walking in in khaki shorts, polo shirt, nice sandals. Call it a graduate student uniform, or an Arizona uniform, but maybe it's a big departure from the normal North Scottsdale lunch crowd.  Anyway, I sensed the vibe come from him -- he thought I didn't know what kind of place this was. So we were talking, and I mentioned that I'd been to Bianco and Humble Pie, that I took Alan Richman's Top 25 pizza places in America and used it as a guide for my trip through the northeast (try Bob and Timmy's in Providence, RI -- they grill their pizza, man). From this, it seemed like he understood that I was a serious individual, someone who was there for the real thing.",

It put forth a decent effort, but needed more fig and goat cheese. However, the crust was dreamy and the service was friendly, which sort of compensated for a few extra dollops of flavor-balancing pizza toppings. Il Bosco also offers small, tasty desserts, topped with Sweet Republic ice cream. Double local business points for ordering one of those after (get the brownie, warm.)  The bill came out 50 bucks for two pizzas and three desserts, which I'd consider a good deal for ze quality. The crust is truly awesome, the patio's relaxing and pretty, and the free olives are always appreciated. You can pretty much taste the integrity in the pizza at this little local spot, and you probably should if you find yourself in the area.",

    "text": "I love wood fire & brick oven pizza. So, found this tiny (and mean TINY) restaurant  by accident after ditching Jack N the Box. Its tucked behind fast food, big name franchises on the North/East corner of Scottsdale & Shea and is a nice little gem.   Besides how small the place is, the first thing you notice is the menu is very small (dinner menu is a little bigger), so me and my friend picked different things and shared. We got a personal pizza and a meatball sandwich. The sandwich was good, but not spectacular, but the pizza is awesome! I went back again for dinner and again the pizza was terrific, as was the salad; delicious. We asked them to do a half and half and they said no problem which is great; I hate when places won't compromise for make you feel guilty for changing their stuff. I loved it and my girlfriend loved it. Also something fun is their soda is not fountain drinks, but bottled real-sugar cane sodas that are delicious.  The only strange thing I have to say is the owner doubles as the server and he is very chatty. That's not a bad thing; he is a very nice guy but be prepared to have a conversation with the guy.  Recommend for a casual lunch and dinner for gourmet pizza & salad.  Pros: Amazing pizza, great food, great service and inviting setting. Cons: Very small menu; caters more toward veggie eaters rather than meaty pizzas.",

We started going there when the original owner and creator opened it, and we have continued going there each time we allow ourselves a treat.  When we heard of Bill's passing, we really grieved.  This place was truly special, and he treated every customer like good friends.  I think the place is still special, and I appreciate that the people who took it over are trying to keep the place as Bill intended.  I highly recommend IL Bosco and wish the new owners well.  I hope you allow yourselves the freedom to keep reinventing the place.  Bill was always trying new ideas and that is part of the spirit that makes the place a gem in the middle of a sea of sameness.",

    "text": "Took a chance and popped in on Valentines day without a reservation (don't even know if they take reservations).  Anyway, we got lucky as there were 4 seats available (would have been more seats but the patio was closed due to inclement weather).   Seated immediately and then...no server.  Had to call over to the hostess to get service.  Once we got that settled, service was fine (mostly).  Had the caprese salad and the valentino pizza (no, not just because it was V Day).  Caprese was amazing and I think the balsamic and some hint of pesto maybe are the key...this is not your everyday boring tomato/cheese plate.   The pizza likewise blew my mind. I'm slightly spice averse but the heat from the Calebrien (sp) chiles was perfect.     Wine selection was perfect match for the cuisine.  Overall, just need to work on service. I understand there was a management change recently BUT the food definitely makes up for this (and hopefully service will improve).    PS. why am i typing almost every sentence with parentheticals (why not?)",

Mr. Forrest and his family operate this gem and are nothing short of wonderful. Having a meal here is like going to a good friend's home for a relaxing, perfect meal. The ambiance is warm and cozy, the music is on point- the service is spot on, and again- the food is epic.     It's worth noting that they also do a great job with takeout. Simply place your phone order ahead of time- and when you arrive they will fire your pie- and two minutes later you're out the door.  One other thing I must highlight is the bread you get with dinner. If you are a bread aficionado- you will flip out when you try their house made bread. It's incredible and they would be a successful bakery if all they did was sell that bread.   The location is great and they also have a lovely patio for dining when the weather doesn't feel like the surface of the sun.   Give this wonderful spot a try. I have tried all the \"best\" in AZ and I unequivocally rate Il Bosco #1.  Try it and you will too.   *Bonus pro tip- if you have leftover pizza, for the love of God don't reheat it in your microwave. Either reheat in the oven or fire up your BBQ for a quick warm up. You'll thank me.",

I went in recently and was saddened to find the family had been pushed out by new ownership. I still ate there and noticed the food was not as fresh as usual and many ingredients were missing off my favorite pizza and appetizers. I will never go back to IL Bosco Pizza after learning how the new owners took advantage of previous arrangements after the founder Bill suddenly passed away. The new owners should be ashamed for forcing out Bills sons right after the passing of their father. Where are your morals?! This is simply bad business and karma will catch up.",

Then, I have seen all the check- ins from Anna M., so I kept trying to make time to come and check it out myself.  I wish I had come sooner, although my hips and thighs might not appreciate that.  We ordered the Biaggia pizza.  I learned it is the most popular, I chose it mainly because I saw figs and prosciutto on it, two of my favorite ingredients.  Then we noticed the next table having a salad I didn't see on the menu.  Well, duh, it was in the specials.  They have daily specials on boards above the bar area.  We decided to share the spinach and kale caesar.  It was so fresh and tasty.  Then on the other table, I saw a dessert that was not on the menu either.  The owner told us it was an apple pizza, part of the special menu also.  Yes, I love to check out what everyone else is eating.  Our dessert was warm and amazing, and the scoop of vanilla  ice cream completed this perfect meal.  We were offered a taste of their homemade Amaretto.  What a treat, it was delicious.  This place made me very reminiscent of my daddy, we used to cook all our italian dishes on Sundays and my daddy used to make his own Lemoncello.  I definitely will come back and I won't wait almost a year to make it.",

The wood fire oven is right there and watching them work is inspiring.  The owner, Bill Forrest, was there and took our order.  It was so nice to see an owner go and visit with the patrons, calling most of them by name, to make sure people were happy with their experience.   Bill cares...about the food they make and about the people who visit.  What a great combination.  I love to eat quality food.  I don't exercise like a should, so I do my best to have a healthy diet because I still have an active lifestyle.  I have become passionate about food, usually preferring to make/grow my own food.    Some day, when I get \"20 seconds of crazy insane courage,\" I will follow Bill's example and do things the right way...the way he does it at Il Bosco Pizza.",

Friday night during prime dinner hours and we were lucky enough to get a table inside. They have lots of seating outside which would be perfect come warmer weather. For now they have heat lamps.  Service was impeccable. The owner floats around and helps his staff and enhances the dining experience (completely unlike the other review mentioned). We were brought a carafe of water, olives and bread to start. We ordered the caprese salad to start. I would eat this EVERY DAY. They use a pesto balsamic glaze that is to die for. The mozzarella is fresh and the cherry tomatoes were bursting with flavor. Next we had one of their specials, fried ravioli. Simple and tasty. Portions here are well sized without going overboard like the chain Italian restaurants do. To finish we ordered the Becca pizza, another special. The crust is delicious here and not one you would want to leave uneaten on the side of your plate.  I can't stress how fresh and wonderfully prepared everything was. I personally cannot wait to go back (did I mention how amazing the caprese salad was?!). This restaurant earns the five star rating because our experience was flawless and anyone who experienced otherwise must be mistaken.",

    "text": "We were on a mission, not one of pizza in general, we just didn't want to go home. So we roamed the streets of the North/Central Valley.  It started with a late breakfast with drinks which kept taking us North and then East, eventually arriving at Il Bosco.   We were the only patrons in there at the time the staff was hustling and bustling.  Come to find out they had a large catering event that evening (love their portable wood fired pizza oven)  and they had also started the preparation of a Superbowl party they were catering on Sunday.    Even with all the Prep going on  Bill greeted us upon entering.  My accomplice (Anna M) had been telling me about this place and we finally stopped in.  Each of us decided on the house Pino Grigio and we decided to split the Biaggia.  I came to this decision with some reluctance, I love fresh figs and find that dried figs can be overly dry and strange when sliced on a pizza or bruschetta  and when it is more of a jam it is often too sweet or applied in a quantity that overwhelms the palate.  Appropriate in their place but often not done well figs can be hit or miss.   I was reassured by both Bill and Anna that all would be ok.     It wasn't long before the pizza was before us.  This was the perfect personal sized lunch pizza (just smaller than the pizza's at Bianco's) . Fresh arugula,  Prosciutto, 4 cheese, evoo  and fig; each cheese was identifiable but none was over powering.  The salinity  of the cheeses and prosciutto really lent themselves amazingly to the lightly sweet caramel earthiness that was the fig component of the pizza.  A perfectly measured drizzle of fig puree, intermingled with extra virgin olive oil and the green peppery nature of arugula... I was sold on the Biaggia.  But what really made me think perfection was the crust.  Having just eaten at Bianco's earlier in the week the essence of their crust was still fresh in my mind as I compared  flavors and textures.  Il Bosco totally wins, tender chewy and crispy, light and slightly sweet not overly toasty or \"burnt\".  The bottom of the crust was cooked at a heat high enough to give the pizza a sturdy base without altering the tenderness of the crust.    Just when I thought it couldn't get any better I was introduced to the house cured olives.  These were heavenly, ripe, flavorful, gently cured and far from the salty, brine-y  commercially available olives commonly offered up at other establishments.   I noticed they sell them by the jar and I regret not picking up a jar before I left, as I find myself  daydreaming about these rich dusky pearls.   Oh well it is not like I needed an excuse to go back but this will give me a reason to go back sooner than expected.",

We began with an appetizer plate of roasted brussel sprouts with mozzarella, an unexpected combination that really works! We then had the Joanna pizza, a fantastic, wood-oven, thin-crust sausage and pepperoni that had great flavor and crust. For dessert, the days special was a lemon sorbetto, packed into a real lemon, a perfect ending. I should also mention the great music selection which added quite a bit to the flavor of the evening. I'm already looking forward to the next visit!",

I wasn't expecting much since it was almost closing time and from my experience with other places is that the employees usually want to get out of there so theres attitude or a sense of being rushed to get me out the door, but when I arrived to pick up my order, the owned greeted me with such a cool calm and collected demeanor which  was such a pleasure, he even helped me carry my food and walked me out to my car. The place itself had a great atmosphere, I can see myself and my husband coming back to eat in next time! I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family!",

No stars taken off for that, just letting you all know that a pizza here is about a slice and a half by weight compared to a normal 18\" pie. For me to get full I ordered a salad $6 and entre $6. You might be a smaller eater and get either or. The execption on pricing is the beverages. I ordered one ice tea and was unpleasantly surprised when I saw the bill for it was $5.75. EDIT: The ice tea was 2.75 and the tap water my coworker ordered was 3.00.",

We had the fried ravioli appetizer followed by the prosciutto, fig, & arugula pizza and the sausage & mushroom pizza. The pizza was delicious. I'd put it on par with another valley favorite, Pomo.   What made the experience special was meeting the owner Bill and his son. Bill is an example of a life well-lived and his warmth and enthusiasm was pleasant.   We don't live close by, but when in the area, I would definitely go back to Il Bosco.",

    "text": "The pizza was so authentic, it brought us right back to our summer in Rome. The ingredients are fresh and wonderfully prepared. We got the Valentina and the Biaggia; both were very special, with great complexity of flavor. However, I'm not sure what all is included in the dining experience. For example, we got complimentary olives, but larger groups got bread and olive oil too. Large groups also had a water decanter on their tables for refills. We were sort of neglected after we got our pizzas and were left sitting without any water for most of our meal. Furthermore, some tables had flowers, others didn't. Since the restaurant is really only open during the evening, I would suggest a candle on each table, instead. This would be more cost effective, and would give the space an even more romantic vibe. Lastly, my amoretto was complimentary at the end of my meal. It was incredible (like butter), but the restaurant shouldn't just be giving that away for free....it's too good. Bottom line, everything needs to be consistent. Every table, every group (no matter the size) should have the same service and experience. That being said, I loved the food here, and would gladly return.",

The meatballs are delish - not spicy but very flavorful and the sauce is great for dipping the bread that they give you.  We've had the traditional Caesar and the kale spinach salad. Between the two we definitely preferred the kale spinach. The Caesar has a thinner dressing on it that isn't bad, it's just not the creamy Caesar I was hoping for. I believe the same dressing is on the kale spinach salad and it fits better with the thicker kale. Plus the kale spinach has pancetta on it - can't go wrong there.  The pizza is definitely the standout here. The crust is done perfectly - not charred and not soggy in the middle. The sauce has a nice flavor and the toppings are placed in just the right amount.  The owner has been there both times and is very warm and welcoming. On our second visit his son was our waiter and was very pleasant as well. The service is fast and the atmosphere friendly.   We will definitely be returning. How else would we become Il Bosco regulars?",

Thought I should share the good news.  Food is still amazing and the service..... 5 star.",

The charge of a couple bucks for tap water is something that the owner needs to reconsider, leaves a bad taste after a great meal.  Upcharge something else to make up for this.  Otherwise great pizza.",

We called in our order, and the staff was very friendly on the phone, and explained that they would not put the pizzas in the oven until we got their, so that they would be fresh and hot for us to eat.  We got the Dona and the Biaggia.  I was worried that they would be tiny after some of the reviews, but they were both a decent size and bursting with flavor.  I was a little reluctant to try fig on a pizza, but the previous reviews told me I had to.  It's a winner!  If you have not gone here yet, give it a shot.  Very excellent pizza for not a lot of dough!",

    "text": "Well, we were swayed by the reviews and good press, so we went.  Not overly impressed, but I guess it is in what one is looking for.  This place has one size pizza, 11 inch, and a pizza variety limited to eight or so.  None are standard Italian fare.  Salads are limited to two pretty ordinary selections.  Our pizza was VERY salty, with a remarkable blandness.  My wife, who has a very limited capacity for pizza was still hungry after we split a salad and a pizza.  Also, beware ordering the $3 bottle of water.  It is very large but non-branded.  Folks who like this type of pizza are those taken with botique kinds of food given a liking for something non-traditional.   Pizza Bianco folks would be happy with this as would Barrio Mexican food fans.  For us, these offerings were lacking in flavor, spice and quantity.  I'm sure the quality of ingredients is good as the proprietor seems to take great care with his product.  However, in the final analysis, we cannot agree with any 5 star rating.  PS.  The owner responded to my comments saying he was happy to be compared to Pizza Bianco and Barrio.  I wasn't suggesting those spots were bad.  However, what they offer is  \"Foofey Food.\"   If that is the kind of fare one likes, so be it.  For those looking for something more substantial, \"Foofey Food\" doesn't do the trick.",

Authentic pizza not loaded with a lot of toppings and not too doughy. They come in one size only, 12 inch. They brought out small tray of 10 olives to nibble on. We started with Cesar Salad,$7.5; glass of Chianti $9 and Boylan Root Beer, $3.5. Followed by the Adrianna pizza and Lucia Pizza, 11.5 and 13.5 respectively. The Lucia pizza had sausage and mushrooms which was proportional and the crust was yummy. You could actually taste the mushrooms because they were quartered instead of sliced. My wife enjoyed her pizza and mentioned that if we want pizza, this is where she wants it. We finished our meal with a Lemon Sorbetto which was an actually lemon hollowed out and the sorbet was packed into it. Refreshing!!

We were served freshly baked in the house bread with olives upon arrival and oh my it was delicious! We ordered stuffed peppers with sausage, burrata, spinach & kale salad and few pizzas - let's just say we enjoyed every bit of it! Definitely new favorite place for authentic Italian pizza!",

The pizzas are perfectly per portioned and the crust perfectly cooked.   The owner was the one that served us and told us that the names of the pizzas have a story behind them which was fun to hear some of them.   It's an eclectic restaurant with church pews for some seating and unmatched chairs and tables which I loved. We sat outside because the weather is great this time of year.   What we ordered: Meatballs- juicy and tender and hot! The \"Adrianna\" pizza  because my fiance's nieces name is that and the \"Gia\" which was amazing.  PROS: everything CONS: nothing  We have found our go to spot now :)",

    "text": "I generally don't write reviews after 1 visit unless things were really great or really horrible. I had seen this place on yelp and it was pretty highly rated and I had a cousin visiting from out of town so I thought, pizza, why not, lets try Il Bosco!  We walked in the door and we were immediately greeted by \"we have no room\" from a white haired man named Bill (who I later deduced was the owner because he had his tweenage son working there as well). Hi to you too!   Alas he found us some space at the bar. I set my things down at the bar, and I happened to have a bottle of water with me that I didn't want to leave to roast in the car because it's Phoenix in July and that would be a waste. I had every intention of ordering a drink. He confiscated my bottle of water and placed it behind his counter, looked at me like I was some sort of village idiot and asked me if I brought my own food in for him to cook, too. I was dumbfounded. He only returned the water after my mom insisted she would put it away.   After reviewing the menu I ordered the Elana pizza without salami, as my cousins requested. Again, I got the you're-an-idiot face from Bill, and a \"you just want a pizza with olives?\" Why yes, sir, is that gonna be okay with you? I'm freakin paying aren't I? He did seem to be very friendly with customers that he knew or were regulars. Sorry you didn't give us that chance.   I was literally OVERWHELMED by the condescension. And then to add the icing on the cake he kept coming by to make sure everything was great and acted all reverent and friendly when we got done and were leaving. Its too freaking bad, Bill. Because Brent(?) and Gerardo and even your son Max were all lovely human beings and the pizza was pretty good too.   But if I wanna feel like an idiot I'll take a calculus class, not come to your pizza joint. Wont be returning.",

The atmosphere is simply wonderful and cozy.  It's a small space but interesting and nicely decorated.

That in itself made the night a blast because to be very blunt and straight forward, her brother and I are hilarious and we make every occasion fun. So, if you need to liven up a party, give me a call, we will jump in his truck and rock your world  Now for the pizza. We came for the pizza, and we loved it. The pizza was delicious. We got 3 different pies ( 2 biaggias). We loved the pie biaggia, that was every ones favorite. We also had the Joanna and Lucia. I loved them all - they were delicious.   Why 3 stars:  1) We waited like 15 minutes for everyone to get a water. They ran out of glasses...This was ridiculous, and we got refiled about once in the hour and a half we were there  2) we were sitting outside, and the heat lamp was broken...tough to enjoy the meal when your shivering - This was in February, so hopefully some of the kinks have been worked out.  3) the meatball appetizer was subpar. Small portions, 3 tiny meatballs, and they were nothing to write home about  4) I like that they have boylan soda brands, but seriously, I would rather have refills on ice tea and a soda on tap then spend 2.75 for like a sip of coke  I will def come back here for the pizza. It is awesome, but I will bring a bottle of water with me",

All of the toppings are good. The crust is super. It's crispy on the outside and tender inside. The fresh made dough has a good taste, too. It is as close to the pizza in Italy as we've found.

First thing: it's tough to find, but don't give up. The restaurant can be found behind their portable wood fire pizza oven. Once inside, wave to the owner. He's wearing a white chef coat and has grey hair. Even if you don't wave, count on a table side visit.   Second: he's a former golf pro who tired of traveling and thought opening a restaurant would be fun.   Third: get the homemade meatballs to start. Delicious and served on a plate of homemade tomato sauce that's also delicious.  Fourth: order the Joanna or Biaggia. Every pie comes in just one size. The Joanna has hot Italian sausage that's home made. The Biaggia is the PERFECT combination of sweet and savory. Yes, it has figs in it and yes, they are delicious.   Fifth: be prepared to come home with money in your pocket because Il Bosco is very affordable.  I brought two buddies from SoCal and all agreed we would return. Lots of people talk about Pizzaria Bianco, and for good reason. Il Bosco is right there in terms of food quality but you don't have to wait four hours. It's the PERFECT local Pizzaria.",

We ordered the salsa, the stuffed peppers, the toasted ravioli, caprese, and one Eggplant pizza for all of us to share.  This was more than enough for the four of us, especially since we were originally not that hungry but wanted to try the various antipasto dishes.  The stuffed peppers aren't the large green peppers, but small red peppers with a nice bite to them and delicious sausage inside.   The bread was delicious.  My mother doesn't usually like cheese (except on pizza) but she liked the toasted ravioli so much that she wants to learn how to make them.  The caprese had fresh mozzarella and sliced cherry tomatoes.  The pizza was superb.  A nice change not to have breaded fried eggplant on a pizza but fresh cubed eggplant.  Everyone there was so nice and the food was delicious and came out quickly.   We were able to enjoy the food without feeling rushed.  I would definitely go back if we are in the area again and recommend it.",

The menu is simple and straight forward, again a nod to True Italian Pizza and Salad.   A friend and I split the Kale and Spinach caesar (excellent flavor)  and the fig, prosciutto, arugula, and goat cheese pizza. Literally the pizza had all my favorite flavors in one, and with the perfect crust it was excellent. Great over all restaurant and will be back again soon!",

The last three times we've gone in the owners tell us they're closed, this time closing in 10 min and then give us a blank stare. That was at 8:10 on a Saturday night! Look the pizza is good, the appetizers not so much, we've been going there for years but this is a new thing, closing at 8:20? Looks like they're doing so well they don't need our business anymore. Pomo pizza a few minutes away sure was happy to have us.",

He was on top of all his customers' needs the whole way through, directing the kitchen and the supporting waitress and chipping in himself to make sure everything was well.  The complimentary bread looked disastrous - it was cold and looked like it was undercooked.  One bite though and it was the best Italian bread we'd ever had.  The flavor was so good.  The caesar salad was also excellent.  We had the mushroom and sausage pizza, which unfortunately was burnt.  It was a bit bitter, or else we probably would've eaten the whole pizza.  The red pepper flakes were super flavorful which I appreciated a lot - most places' flakes are stale and doesn't provide this much kick.    So usually the burnt pizza at a pizza place would definitely lose a star or two, but I can't help but love this place.  The owner was so nice, and even gave us some homemade amaretto that was off the charts.  It was great on our dessert of chocolate covered ball of chocolate, pistachio and strawberry gelatos.  The hospitality of the place, the quality of the food and service, and the set up of the place are why I'm a super fan of this restaurant.  I'm hoping the pizza will be good next time too!",

Do a Yelp search ... Frank Pepe Pizza, New Haven, CT ... they are world famous.  Ronald Reagan and Frank Sinatra used to have pizza flown to them from New Haven, Ct. as it was so highly regarded.  When I lived in Ct, we would drive from Middletown to New Haven at least once a month.  The final results are in ... (Frank Pepe will not be happy)  Bill in Scottsdale is better (it even surprised me) ... Everyone who reads this should give Ill Bosco one try and understand that the absolute MOST delicious pizza in America is in of all places Scottsdale, Arizona and produced by someone who was once the premiere PGA Golf Coach in America (2006 PGA Golf Coach of the Year)  in a location that is virtually impossible to find.    How is this possible?  ... Most of the pizza in Arizona is sub-standard and everyone living here knows it  ...  You mention going out for pizza in Arizona and most everyone from back east figures they are going to suffer through a lousy meal.  But Bill has done something different.  In a state filled with mediocrity (or less), he has taken pizza to an art form.  You think Pizza Bianco with all their national publicity  is Number 1 in the state of Arizona ??? ... WRONG ... Yes Bianco has great pizza (i've eaten there and enjoyed it even though they have the most uncomfortable seating as everyone is packed together like sardines), but Ill Bosco is better (check the other YELP reviews to see if i am just blowing smoke).  And eating at Bill's is comfortable ... plenty of elbow room and a vibe that makes you appreciate Scottsdale ... you just want to sit and enjoy which is something very rare in 2014.  And to top it all off the owner is a Gem ... When you walk in, it's like being part of a family.  You won't be coming just once ... Give it a try ... You'll see.",

The toppings are all great, love the spicy sausage and the pepperoni. Lastly, the thing I really love is that the pizza is not overly salty. You can taste each ingredient without the sauce or the salt overpowering the flavors. Love the cute setup as well and the Italian style tumblers for wine. Too hot now but they have a nice patio too.

If I were to come again, I would wait until Winter, because eating outside when it is over 100 degrees is really not enjoyable at all. I can see where eating outside during the nice time of year would be really fun though. I ordered the pizza with goat cheese, fig, arugula, citrus and Parmesan. It was so amazing. I loved the way my taste buds danced as I learned the different flavors in each bite. The pizza was a little pricey for what you get $15. But I loved it. I would definitely come back.",

Even under new management, this place still has the cozy and quaint vibe that originally first drew me in.  The pizza is great and the dough/crust is crisp on the outside and soft amazing in the inside. So good! Even though it isn't the exact same as before, and change isn't always welcomed by all, if you come in with an open mind, the change can be a welcomed thing! Do yourself a favor and try it out regardless of the naysayers. You won't be disappointed!",

Inside the restaurant is tiny but charming. The menu includes starters, salads and pizza but before ordering check out the \"special board\" that hangs from the ceiling. We finally decided on the Biagga. It came topped with prosciutto, fig jam and goat cheese. It was incredibly tasty and the perfect combination of ingredients.   What makes this place special is the personal touch of the staff and the quality of the food. They are there to make sure you have a good experience. After only one visit I'm hooked!

Funny, she asked me where i'd heard about the place and I told her the internet, she said \"Yawp (sic) ?..yeah most of those are family or friends, we got 5 stars or somethin'.\" That explains ALOT! Gee, good thing me and my husband weren't really hungry, twenty bucks for a snack? Not bad quality but tiny quantity for price. Sauce is kinda raw, undertaste of wine and exactly two nickel sized slivers of  garlic sausage per slice. Cheese is good quality. I see why the place was empty at 7pm on a Saturday.

The owner, Bill, waited our table himself and was so friendly, attentive and conversational. You can tell that he and the staff take a lot of pride in the quality of their food!   We elected to sit inside, which seemed to be the right choice, since the music next door was pretty loud and could have easily overwhelmed the outdoor seating area. The place was small, but quite cozy with a great view of the food preparation and pizza oven. Seriously, I watched that oven, and nothing sat in the window for more than a minute before it hit a table (impressive!!)   We started with some of the most tender, delicious meatballs I've had, sopping up the delicious marinara with our fresh, hot bread. Sooo good! We went for the Carmela pizza and both loved it!!! The ingredients were of very high, fresh quality, and it was piping hot! The wine was okay ($9 a glass is a little high for table wine in my opinion), but they kept our glasses full and we loved it! I hope to save some room for spumoni next time... Give this place a try! (They also offer take out if you're more interested in pick-up pizza!)",

    "text": "With a 4 1/2 star average on 155 reviews, there's little I can add that hasn't already been said.  It just feels good to add another 5 star vote for a pizza that is unusually good.  Standing out as much as this pizza stands out should mean something.  From every big city to every rural town, there is always a pizza place.  Our own USDA published a scholarly paper earlier this year calling pizza the world's most popular food.  On top of that, I've lived my entire life in Chicago, and notwithstanding the ridiculous notion some New Yorkers have that they know good pizza, most knowledgeable foodies agree that Chicago is the pizza capital of the universe.  And we do have terrific pizza in Chicago.  Lou Malnati's, Fox's, Toni's, Pequod's, Vito and Nick's, and on and on.  But there's something about Bill's pizza here that seems to always be served with a kind of pride and love and devotion to the product that is plain and simply rare.  The mozzarella is exquisitely fresh, and every single ingredient, from veggies to meat, is fresh and flavorful.  The tomato sauce rivals the best in Italy itself.  The crust is so good that it stands alone as a homemade bread of the finest ingredients.  And yes, I've had the famous Pizzeria Bianco, and Grimaldi's, and Oregano's, and they are all perfectly acceptable pies.  But Il Bosco is simply in a class by itself.  It's all done in a very small space, no reservations accepted, a little hard to see from the street - no matter, do whatever you have to do if you want one of the absolute best pizzas in a world full of pizzas.  I'm lucky, because when I visit Scottsdale several times a year to see my son and his family, he lives very nearby, and we can go at odd hours and avoid the crowds.  But whatever it takes, do it.  You'll see what I mean.",

    "text": "Seasoned Phoenix/Scottsdale area diners know the usuals when it comes to great pizza: Bianco, Cibo, Pomo....Il Bosco deserves to join that list.   They serve pizza cooked in a wood-burning oven. Each pie (only one size here) spends about 90 seconds to two minutes in the oven. The result is fantastic. What separates great pizza from good? The crust. And the crust at Il Bosco is the right combination of the three Cs: char, crisp and chew that you can only achieve with an extremely hot pizza oven. If you judge your pizza on the crust, first and foremost, as I do, you'll love this place.  Of course, pizza is more than simply great crust. Pizza varieties, all named after women, should be enough to please everyone. Il Bosco offers a good variety of red and white pies. I didn't try any of the white pies yet, but they looked very good. I can heartily recommend the following red pies: Joanna, Elana and Lucia. Elana was my personal favorite, with mozzarella, olives and sopressata salami.   Beverages are somewhat limited, but that doesn't mean you'll be disappointed. Bottles of wine are affordable. The Italian Pinot Noir was excellent at $25 for the bottle. They also have two types of beer on tap, Four Peaks Kilt Lifter and an Italian brand I cannot recall. Soft drinks include cane-sweetened colas and root beers.  Dessert options were also limited, likely because the pizza is so good most don't have room for dessert. The creme brule was topped with fresh fruit (strawberries and blueberries). The flavor was quite good, but I felt like it should have had a thicker layer of burnt sugar.  The size of the restaurant adds to its charm. By my approximation, it seats no more than two dozen diners at one time. Bill, the owner, was working with just two employees Saturday night. At times the action became frenetic, but they worked with a smile, and were never too busy to engage in conversation. Despite the fact that there were people waiting to be seated, we never felt rushed.  Get here before the AZ Republic reviews this place. Because the line will be out the door once the word is out!",

Tucked away next to Handlebar J's, this cozy place has all the charm you would expect from an owner that has a passion for creating an authentic Italian experience.  We have visited Il Bosco now on several occasions since its opening, and have yet to find a flaw in the service or food.    Having the owner personally wait on you is always a nice touch in a locally owned restaurant, and Bill makes sure that you always feel welcome and appreciated.    Il Bosco has an excellent wine list that compliments the eclectic selection of wood fired pies, including a refreshing Procecco that really hits the spot on a warm Arizona evening.  These guys even produce their own sparkling water!  Complimentary in-house marinated olives and artisan bread baked fresh daily make a nice start to the meal, while Il Bosco's version of Caprese salad will make you think you've died and gone to heaven.  The fresh, local ingredients Il Bosco uses makes all the difference, and has this starter bursting with flavor.  Chef Dennis is the \"mastro pasticciere\" at Il Bosco, turning out crispy/crunchy deliciousness from his 700+ degree wood-fired oven.  It is obvious this ain't his first rodeo, and is happy to explain his technique to anyone who is lucky enough to grab a front row seat at the bar to watch him in action.  The pizzas he serves up are nothing short of amazing.  The Biaggia - a goat cheese, fig and proscuitto really took me by surprise and has now become one of my favorites.    Last night I had the Domenica - a spicy sausage and leek pizza that redefined my opinion of what a sausage and leek pizza should be. :)  There are pizzas for the less adventurous, I encourage you to go to the Il Bosco website and take a look the menu, then call for a reservation to experience this outstanding Scottsdale treasure!     Support your local restaurants, folks!  They are what gives a city it's uniqueness.",

Bill is not only a wonderful host, but the food is consistently superb and the overall energy (especially at night) is incredible.

First time hear - and not sure when the next time would be, so tried a few things:  the meatballs, the Biaggia pie and another special pie - red sauce, pancetta, red onions (I think) - all was delicious!    Like some other reviewers have mentioned, we had the opportunity to meet and chat with the owner - a very nice guy, who's really mastered the pizza art.  We ate outside - enjoying the nice cool evening air.  All in all a great experience!  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Ok, why is it that when it comes to writing REALLY good reviews, or REALLY bad reviews, I usually (not always) get it done straight away. But when it comes time to write the less than 5 star but more than 1 star review I procrastinate. In any case, here's my review of il Bosco, finally.   Where to begin, well, when you price your pizza in the same range as say Pizzeria Bianco, and you model your whole concept on them as well (more on this later), you better be phenomenal. But lamentably Il Bosco isn't phenomenal, theyre ok, the pizza is good, just not great. That said, the owner must have cajones the size of Texas to have priced his pizza in the same range as Chris Bianco's, or maybe its just his ego that's over inflated hence the over inflated price. As I've already said, its not bad, its just not $12-$15 per pizza great, the crust is good, but so delicate it cant handle a trip up the street a few blocks without completely collapsing into sogginess (I tried to take one home to my bro). I deduced that this must be the reason I saw 3 customers come in for take out and all of them had to wait as their pizza was cooked, after their arrival. They simply will not cook it until you are there to pick it up, which means you will always have a bit of a wait. We also had the meatballs al forno, which were not only small, but one of them was burnt, and I mean black spot burnt, but they served it to us anyway. Again, 2 of the 3 small meatballs were ok, they were good, but not, \"hot damn I'm coming back here again soon\" good, and the burnt one was not good at all of course. The caprese salad was probably the best thing we had there, but again, it was good, not great. The wine selection was decent, although I would say the reds are a better selection than the whites.   Now back to the afore mentioned similarities, like Biancos, Il Boscos menu features 2 salad choices, 2 small plate choices, and a variety of pizzas. Again just like Bianco's, they also offer house made mozzarella and bread, though the bread seems suspiciously dense, thick and un-Italian, not to mention nowhere in the vicinity of Bianco's quality either. This is where the menu similarities end though, Il Bosco offers 4 dessert options, but oddly, save for the the gelato, none of them are Italian, no tiramisu or cannoli here. Along with the gelato, a root beer float, brownies, and creme brulee are offered. What is a French dessert doing on the menu of a decidedly Italian restaurant (judging from the name Il Bosco which in Italian means woods or roughly forest)? Again, that suspiciously un-Italian vibe creeps up.  I bring my tome to an end by saying that a google search of Il Bosco filled in some of the blanks for me, and now I understand why my experience was what it was. Il Bosco is not Italian owned or operated, its actually the artistic retirement endeavor of a retired golf pro who isnt even close to being Italian (maybe THAT'S why the meatballs were so close in size to golf balls, lol). Well I'm old school, and for me, when it comes to better dining, you have to be Italian to make Italian food, and Ill pay more for the luxury if need be. That said, this place is ok if you're really hungry, in the area, and don't mind paying Pizzeria Bianco prices for pizza that is lesser in quality than Il Capo, which is right up the street.",

    "text": "Okay, okay, okay.  I endlessly daydream I am sitting at a quaint corner street in Naples, Italy eating al fresco with a beautiful fresh pie atop an iron table just a few inches larger than my plate.  The fragrant smell of fresh crushed tomatoes, warm mozzarella, earthy basil, and olive oily hand-rolled wood fired pizza crust wafting through my olfactory glands.  This dream is so often replayed in my mind that I must convince myself that I have actually never been outside of US territory (I know, it's a problem). While we all have our favorite food fixations, my particular obsession is, none other than, the pizza pie.  New York, Chicago, New Jersey, St. Louis, Detroit, New Haven, California, or even Naples.  I'll take it any way, all day, any where.  After visiting @ilboscoaz in Scottsdale, I was left pondering, \"have I had better pizza than this?  I have had a lot of pizza!  Could this be........*GASP*........my favorite?  In Arizona?\". It's like choosing our favorite of our pets and I assume parents with their children.  Can we have a favorite? (Yes, his name is Todd.  I have five animals because I am crazy.  He is my favorite.  He is a . I am a sucker for anything cute). To answer the question, I am still left without resolve, but what I can say is that I'll never forget the flavor and aroma of their Valentina . It simple: pepperoni, cheese, Calabrian chili crushed and mixed in with the sauce, drizzled with sweet, sweet . @ilboscoaz is tucked inside a back alley behind the shopping center at Scottsdale and Shea in Scottsdale, Arizona.  A seemingly unlikely place for the Universe's best pizza pie.  A hidden gem.  A place for us all to ponder the best pizza we've ever had; and maybe, just maybe, a little hole in the wall in Arizona has what we've all been searching for, the perfect slice.  Stop by @ilboscoaz in Scottsdale and decide for yourself.  We all need answers!  Check out my stories for more of our salivating experience.",

    "text": "Years ago, my girlfriend and I stopped by Il Bosco after reading a lot of their positive Yelp reviews. The former owner was the man who brought our pizzas to the table. After delivering one, he brought out the second and ended up accidentally elbowing my soda, spilling it all over the first pizza, ruining it in the process. Looking annoyed, like it was my fault and not his, he quickly ordered another one in an extremely awkward moment with no apology given.  This was my first interaction with Bill Forrest, former golf pro and pizzaiolo of Il Bosco.  Despite this hiccup, we were both mutually impressed with the food and decided to go back, despite my reservations on the owner. During this second visit, which ran much more smoothly, I told my girlfriend I was going to ask Bill what he thought the best pizza (aside from his) was in Phoenix. Expecting a short, snarky answer, I was surprised that Bill actually stood and talked with us for 30 minutes about pizza. His favorites, his inspirations, what he likes and doesn't like about certain styles, as well as his opinion on Yelp reviews.  After this conversation, Bill (and his son) always remembered us. Bill would always come by and inquire to what new places we've visited lately and sought out recommendations from us. He consistently remembered our preferred orders, which always impressed me. Despite going to other restaurants much more frequently than Il Bosco, Bill never forgot about us.  When he passed away in 2018, something we found out about far after the fact, we were both saddened by the loss. Bill made spectacular pizza and created a warm and quirky little environment that reminded me of something you'd find in a place like Flagstaff. The place is now under new ownership, which from what I read, had a bit of controversy surrounding it. And in many ways, it's upsetting that his family is no longer attached to the restaurant. However, after a recent visit, I can confidently say that the food remains (mostly) unchanged.  Il Bosco pizzas are a combination of both traditional and unique creations, with the Mia breakfast-style pizza probably being the best of the bunch. Other favorites include the Biaggia for fig lovers and any red sauce style pizza. Ingredients are top notch, while crust remains crispy, light, and full of flavor.  Starters, such as their bread, meatballs, and fried ravioli are all solid options, while desserts seem to have changed a bit. I'd suggest bringing back the old lemon sorbetto, which was served directly out of an ice-cold lemon. But if not, the cookie a la mode is always a safe bet.  We didn't get a chance to speak to the new owner, as they became swamped once we arrived. But from what I overheard and observed, he seems to be very personable and inviting, so at least the customer service aspect of this place has remained intact. Allegedly, they are looking to open another location and expand. I'm sure they'll do well, as the place still seems to have a lot of regular customers.  Ultimately, I'm glad to see that Il Bosco still manages to deliver great pizza.   We miss you, Bill!",

    "text": "These guys are killing it. This month, I enjoyed amazing pizza at Bianco, and had two fantastic dinners at Tratto, that were some of the best meals I have had in town. And then I walked into Bianco.   Now, the day before, I had been with a group from Univision and the most popular host of a Spanish language TV program in the world, and a judge on many cooking shows. When we walked in, the pizza chef at Bianco rushed out to meet him, and they went out of their way to make sure that everything that came to us was the best I have ever had there.  And the next night, I was asked by a close friend to return to IL Bosco. And, juxtaposed next to those four absolutely fabulous pies from Bianco...it was different, and to my palate, even more enjoyable.   The crust was a little more flavorful, and \"yeastier\". There was a little more tasty char, but not too much, crisper under the toppings, not overly bready on the edges, and it was just more complex than what we had the day before.   I don't want to say better....because they are very similar in style and both are fantastic, but I enjoyed the last pie more. And, while we were completely fawned over at Pizzeria Bianco because of my famous guest, the service at IL Bosco was even more attentive, and it was just us.  And the pie: In addition to the precision and complexity of the crust, Daniel the pizza chef, recommended something different in a pie he was trying with chorizo, braised onions, mushrooms, and an egg in the middle.  Not at all what I was salivating for walking in, but we dubbed the pie: \"The greatest hangover dish ever created\". The taste was incredible, and different, yet the comfort factor was out of this world with the egg-yolk mixing with the other ingredients. All accompanied by great, inexpensive red wine selections, that night the favorite was the Montepulciano. In a great pizza town, this is still the only place where I have never had a less than absolutely stellar pie, and working through the menu, I think I've now hit them all...keep innovating!",

    "text": "Possible Hidden Gem of Scottsdale?  Me and my friends came here recently for dinner on a whim. You almost wouldn't know it was there with the other businesses around. That being the case, I am very glad we found it.   We were sat right away and because of that we ordered right away because we knew what we wanted. Pizza, and lots of it. I'm pretty sure the ones that stuck to mind the most were the Gabriella(or maybe it was the Joanna?) and the special I ordered. One of them was more of a basic pepperoni pizza but man was it the best fancy pepperoni pizza I've had in awhile. I really enjoyed the sauce and the fact that it wasn't too greasy.   Now the pizza I got was one that had white sauce, Brocollini and Sausage. Those 3 things are definitely my jam when it comes to food but for some reason it wasn't quite up to par. The sauce and the pizza overall was still tasty but the Brocollini was a tad undercooked. Secondly if you notice in my picture below, there are no sausages. Profound Sadness. The only other gripe I had was their fancy sodas. I got the Cola but honestly I still was craving a regular ole Coke Cola. I honestly feel like they should use regular soda. It's cheaper and much tastier imo.  Ultimately I had an amazing experience though. Our waitress was nice and the owner was extremely friendly. He apologized and hooked us up with extra sausage on the side. When one of us needed ranch, he went all the way to a neighbor restaurant just to get some and then brought it over. Talk about customer service! Il Bosco would definitely be the pizza place I would go to if I lived here. It's probably one of the best pizza's places in the area that not everyone knows about.",

Unfortunately, his boys took over the business, and it proceeded to take a huge dive.  His sons cared about your money, not the experience or the food.  You'll note the several recent 1-star reviews from their friends as they attempted to throw their last temper tantrum with bitter fake reviews.  Thankfully, the controlling interests sold the place to Jeff and his partner, and they have resurrected it with everything that matters - great pizza, salads, appetizers, wine and beer selections, and most importantly, engaged service.  Bill's staff stayed on, and it is readily apparent that they are in a much better place.  They're obviously happy and serving up some amazing food.    If you're looking a fun, comfortable and reasonably priced dining experience with indoor and outdoor options, this is as good as it gets!",

The new owners claim nothing has changed, but it certainly has.  The pizza dough  is not like it was before -- the crust is chewy and flavorless.  The pizza toppings just don't taste the same.  Caesar salad is still delicious.  We have been a half dozen times under new ownership, but won't be returning.",

So we pull up, made sure they were open, we were seated by an amazing young waitress and had one of the best Pizza dinners of our life!   My wife had the Carmella pizza, gluten-free, which shot her to the moon! She was completely beside herself as to how amazing one: the gluten-free crust was and two: the overall taste and structure of the pizza! Myself  on the other hand, I chose the: Valentina pizza. The taste is something that I've never experienced before. It had the right amount of spice and flavor to it!Drop what you're doing this weekend, then race over to the Bosco. You will not be disappointed. Ever!",

    "text": "I feel late to the party discovering this place! Thank goodness for Yelp! or I'd never know about it!  We eat across the street at Guido's for years and never knew this place existed! So glad we found it!   This restaurant is very small (about the size of an ice cream shop). But the benefit is that it is very quiet and peaceful inside. The prices are fair and the pizza is very light.   I ordered the Adrianna pizza and it has to be the single best Margherita pizza I have ever had.   Unfortunately, there are no fountain machines here. Nor are there Coke or Pepsi products. They serve Boylan's sodas by the bottle. I like that it's different, but the soda beverage limitation negatively impacts my overall meal experience.  I imagine if I wanted a beer with my pizza, I'd be satisfied, but I'm not a beer or wine drinker. Perhaps I need to bring my own Coke with me next time?  My wife ordered the lunch special with a three topping pizza (pepperoni, mushroom and onions) and she absolutely loved it!  We will definitely be coming back here again. A shame its so hidden and finding a spot to park can be difficult when it's busy, but there is plenty of parking on the other side of Scottsdale Blvd, with a short walk. Totally worth it! Forget Pizzeria Bianco. While that pizza is good, this pizza is better on price, crowds and flavor!",

    "text": "I had been working next door to Il Bosco for the last 4 months and constantly smelling the deliciousness of pizza cooking. I would always tell myself, \"one day when you get off work you need to go order a pizza!\"  Well I finally went in and ordered my pizza. I've always loved the outdoor little patio seating, there's just something about it that says \"comfy, inviting, relaxed\"...and although I placed my order to -go, I do look forward to coming back to sit and dine on that patio with the beautiful weather coming.   Anyway, as I came into the pizza restaurant I was immediately greeted by Jeff the owner. I told him the story of how I had always wanted to try the food here and he talked with me for several minutes telling me about all the different choices of pizza on the menu. I settled on the \"Carmela\" which was sausage (I got the spicy), spinach, mushrooms, sauce, cheese.  It was prepared quickly and I enjoyed a nice glass of red wine while I waited. As soon as I got out to my car I couldn't wait till I got home, I had to have a slice. Seriously THE BEST pizza I've had in Arizona.... and I'm not just saying that. It's the real deal.   Growing up in Las Vegas there was a little pizza place that we would go to that I honestly have never found any place that has ever matched how good it was.... I have now found it.   Go... you won't be disappointed. I promise",

Our starters were Caesar salad meatballs, and mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes. We could've just had that. The party had a selection of pizza... From traditional pepperoni to gluten free options. Some cool beers on tap (had Scottsdale Blonde and Ballast Point Sculpin). Smaller intimate restaurant with an active/engaged owner. Definitely impressed us!

I will warn it can be a little tricky to find but it is right next to Handlebar J in Scottsdale. It is a small place that reminded us of the little bodegas we visited while in Spain. Small, quaint, and authentic. We started with roasted vegetables  (beets) that were fantastic. They were roasted in the wood fired oven, which I think everything is cooked in. The beets were over the top of an incredibly creamy, what I believe was a mozzarella cheese, and simply seasoned. Loved them. We then chose a pizza made with a fig jam, prosciutto, mozzarella, and topped with arugula. Again fantastic. It was difficult to choose which pizza because they offered so many great combinations. Lots of top quality ingredients to choose from, gourmet cheeses, and and an authentic Italian crust - crispy from the brick oven, a little chewy (not doughy), and cooked perfectly.   I could go on but hopefully I've given you enough info to give this place a try. Great place for a date night!",

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, when I was craving a good pizza, but didn't want to make that infamous drive/wait in downtown Phx.   Me and my best gal showed up, and were promptly seated for dinner on a Thursday with little to no crowd around 6 PM (that quickly changed). We started with water and some delicious olives, and moved onto to the pizza... Let me tell you, if I could have one pizza for three meals a day, it would be the Valentina. Sweet/spicy-all in one. You NEED this in your life.   I woke up the next morning so sad we didn't order two pizzas and have leftovers honestly. So if I could change one thing, it would be that! Also, the owner is ridiculously sweet and stopped by the table. I will be back, and telling everyone about this place!!",

    "text": "(Lyrics - Kelis - Bossy)  Il Bosco It's a fresh bite to scream up my Yelp It switched up the beat to my heart That's right it brought imported cheese to the boulevard And that's right, it's the one who's firewood oven to start   Il Bosco It's a place y'all love to date It's a place that's raised the stakes I told Yelp Phoenix there's no debate I'm back with an appetite cause it's Bosco  Il Bosco Pizza is a locally own spot quaint and popping with some firewood cooked pizza; this place definitely has a lovely charm to it.    I came on a rainy evening so the place inside was packing!  I would say the inside seats a max of 35 people including the bar.  The open kitchen where you can see the firewood oven was an allure while chef craft his work.    We started with a bottle of wine plus some Fried Ravioli.  The ravioli came along with some sweet marinara sauce and had a decent soft doughiness to it.  Next we shot for the Caprese Salad; which was my favorite.  It came with Burrata cheese along with the traditional Mozzarella cheese, tomato, and balsamic.  Overall, one of my favorite bites of the night.  Fluffy burrata along with smooth and stringy mozzarella cheese ending with a sweet balsamic punch.    For our pizza we ordered their Biaggia & Carmela.  The Biaggia came with prociutto, fig jam, four cheese, and arugula.  Overall, a decent bite but I felt the arugula was over-powering.  The fig jam was light and I wish they would put more on it.  The Carmela came with tomato sauce, sausage, spinach, and caramelized onions.  The tomato sauce was a welcoming pairing with the saltiness of the sausage and sweet onions.  In the end, Il Bosco Pizza is a little sweet spot for some farm to table pizza.  Traditional Italian bites with some allure of the ambiance.  The firewood oven is awesome to watch, but not sure how well it fares during the summer months. - Enjoy!",

    "text": "Fail.  Walked in on a weeknight around 7 p.m. Tiny seating area all but full. One 4 top remaining. We asked to be seated there. A worker said that he'd rather we sit at the bar. Well, um, you have an open table and 2 people who want to sit and spend money here. No, I don't \"do\" bar seating to eat dinner. I'll sit at a bar if I want to knock back a drink or two, maybe have an app. and then take off. Sitting at a bar is not a comfortable way to relax over dinner and unwind after a long day.  So, no thank you. Despite awesome reviews that suggest the food is good. Attitude is important, too. There are ways to handle this kind of thing. And, there are ways to not handle this kind of thing.   Probably will not make another attempt to try this place. I don't need attitude at the end of my long day.  NOTE: To the person who decided to call me out - by name - over this review, this was my legit reaction to my experience. I'm glad you had a better experience. Clearly many reviewers find that this place offers amazing food. I wish I'd been treated well enough to have been able to discover this for myself. No need to call anyone out by name, sir. Our experiences are our experiences. The Yelp community can help one another by providing honest feedback.  Second update: I've been debating whether or not to write this for a while. First off, there wasn't just one, but two fellow Yelpers who chose to call me out by name for the above review. Not cool! Like it or not, it's a legit recap of my experience. And, I was able to get one of those people's reviews taken down. No idea why the other stays put. Whatever. Here's the reason for this update: five months after I posted this review, the owner reached out to me via private email. Props to him for that even if it came five months after the fact. However, in his explanation, which was, actually, not unreasonable, he decided to say that I had \"stormed out.\" Well, sir, that isn't True. How is it that I made such a memorable impression if I was in and gone in under a minute and it was many months ago? You said to our request to sit at a 4-top and I quote, \"I'd rather you sit at the bar.\" You didn't say something like, \"I'm sorry but that table is reserved and we'll have another table in a few minutes.\" Had you said that, sir, we very likely would have stayed. Clearly your food is very good; I dine out a lot and I rely on Yelpers to give good advice. Congrats for the good reviews on your food quality. But, don't take an opportunity and turn it right back on me saying that I \"stormed out\" before you could explain. Just for future reference, because it is truly awesome you can fill your restaurant, and serious congrats for that, it's not your customer's fault that you are full up. A friendly, \"we'll have an open table in just a bit\" works. \"I'd rather you sit at the bar\" doesn't play well. Good luck.",

It's cute and quaint and offers excellent wood fired pizza! It was cooked perfectly and had that delicious wood fired taste to it. Delicious home made pizza sauce as well.   The owner was incredibly kind and welcoming as well. He spent a lot of time talking to us and making lovely suggestions for us to explore our new city.  He really knows how to run a business and make his patrons feel comfortable.   I can't wait to come back.",

I ordered through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FDoorDash.com&s=caa5c3cd82e0ea851de7140809551a0732b8f726e604ed0c9c1197f2774280de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">DoorDash.com</a>, which was a disaster unto itself.  I can't blame Il Bosco for the fact that my pizza arrived cold. What I can blame them for though, is that the pizza was inedible because it tasted like a salt lick.    My Order - The Adrianna (cheese, tomato sauce, basil)  I have had some bad pizza in my day, but I can always power through, because even bad pizza is usually has some redeeming quality.  This, however, I had to throw out.  It was burnt in places (I know wood fire pizza is going to have some char marks, but this was flat out burnt).  I would have been willing to deal with the burnt parts, but it was so salty I couldn't choke it down.  Believe me, I like salt - I add it to everything. If I'm saying it was too salty, it's because it tasted like someone dropped the entire jar of Morton's in the sauce, then tried to hide the spill with the cheese.    Perhaps dining in would yield a better pie, I don't know.  It would take a lot of me to take the risk though.",

I tried two different pies, the Caprese salad and their creme brule.  All were well made and the service speedy and friendly.

The pizzas are big and more than enough for the average person. The desserts were very delicious as well. I know this is a small complaint but the sodas are disgusting. They don't have Pepsi or Coke products just these custom cane sugar drinks. No bueno. The owner talked with us half of the time we were there. He is a cool guy. Just don't ever ask him for ranch, ham or pineapple for your pizza. It offends him rightfully so because his pizzas are pretty good. The service was okay but the server rarely came around.

We arrived at 8:15 and got a chilly reception. The person waiting on us splashed the wine into our glasses and I ended up with some on my jeans.

The first thing I noticed was a giant bag of pre-shredded mozzarella cheese sitting on the counter. For an authentic Neopolitan-style brick oven pizza place that is unacceptable. As expected the pizza tasted like it was made with processed cheese.   The sauce and mozzarella just melted into a big gooey mess in the center and the crust was pretty dry and flavorless.  This pizza is average at best. I was really disappointed in this place, especially after some reviewers compared it to Bianco's, Cibo and Pomo.  Hate to say it, but il bosco isn't close to being in the same league as those places.  If I didn't know better I would suspect most of these reviews are the usual friends and family pump-up.",

My wife had the Fig, Goat cheese, Prosciutto and Arugula pizza,what a pie. I had the Lucia, and the kids had normal pepperoni, which they all raved over. You also have to have the Caprese salad, very, very good. The service was very friendly and informative. My only regret on the restaurant is that it's here in Arizona and not Connecticut.

The restaurant is small and does not seat many people so we were sure to make a reservation (they only offer 2 slots each night). At the last minute, we had to add 2 more to our party which they took on with no issue at all and were able to accommodate all of us. The food is awesome, the ambiance is great, quick and friendly service. All around, this was a very authentic Italian experience at what I consider to be a fair price point. The pizzas are intended to be personal size but if you're not starving, they could definitely be shared. For dessert we tried to vanilla gelato, spumoni tortufo, and a brownie. All of them were delicious but the spumoni was definitely the winner. At the end of our meal, the owner offered us all a taste of his homemade amaretto which was fabulous. Absolutely recommend this place for anyone looking to enjoy a good, affordable, authentic Italian experience.",

I came here tonight with my sister, and we both thought it was nice, the inside is a bit small and no one was sitting inside when we came! Outside we could hear the live music from next door which was fun haha. I loved the little lights. One complaint is it was too crammed..it was basically like sitting at the same table as the people next to us which was a little bit weird. Also we had to pick up and move the table to get in and out of our seats haha. But it didn't look like all of the tables were like that!  The bathroom was nice and clean which is a bonus. The lady who seated and served us was nice, everything done in a timely matter and she made sure to check up on us! My sister wasn't sure if she wanted the meatballs or a salad. She got the salad and wasn't a huge fan. It's a small portion for $7 and didn't even have caesar dressing, it had some other type of dressing. The croutons were weird too, I didn't like them. The bread with oil was tasty! And luckily, the pizza made up for the mediocre salad. Very good quality stuff! A tiny bit too soggy in the middle, but otherwise totally excellent. I'd love to come back and try out the pesto pizza! Would recommend this place too!",

    "text": "Il Bosco is my favorite pizza place in the valley!  I have been to all the ones you know and all the ones that your friends tell you about with glowing eyes having just been to some great new hidden pizza place that they think they have just discovered. Let me know tell you, none of them compare.   It's a cosy place where you feel like family. The Canadian owner is super friendly as are all the servers. You are served some delicious olives which you can buy a jar of to take home. I prefer the Lucia pizza which normally has sausage and mushrooms but I get with pepperoni and mushrooms instead. The pizzas are all wood fired and when you take a bite you feel like you are in Naples instead of Scottsdale. My friend gets the Biaggia which is their prosciutto and argula pizza and if that is your thing this is where you want to come. It is so well balanced with the fig jam and earthy.   Go to Il Bosco! You will love it, scout's honor!",

    "text": "After scouring the United States to find the best pies, I would go on a limb to say that Il Bosco is within the Top 5 Pizzerias in the Nation! The sauce, the cheese, the quality of the toppings, and, most notably the crust, are all exactly what you'd expect from a proper thin crust pizza. If you live in the Phoenix area, don't eat pizza from any other restaurant until you get your butt to Scottsdale to try this place out. If you're visiting Phoenix from somewhere else, you need to try out this joint. It's truly a hidden gem.",

The place has a great patio area, though in the smaller side,  it had ample seating.  We ordered the meatball al forno and they came out quickly and piping hot.  Seriously amazing meatballs! Then the pizza came out not long after. The brick oven they had was the secret to making one of the best pizzas we've enjoyed in AZ. We will be back!",

    "text": "As an Italian with high expectations in this area of food, I went into this restaurant with high expectations. In doing so I look for two primary concepts in a restaurant, the food itself and the environment. Bosco Pizza implemented both the food and environment excellently.  Environment: Once I walked into the restaurant I immediately felt welcomed. I was hit with the aroma of the Italian pizza as well as a welcoming environment from the owner himself named Bill. While the restaurant was completely full, he managed to get the five of us a table within five minutes. Once we received our table, Bill was incredibly friendly and the restaurant itself gave off a social vibe to it. I was incredibly impressed by the look of the interior design. It was small, yet filled with more than one would expect from an Italian restaurant. There were multiple unique decorations and the specials of the day labeled clearly near the kitchen. When we ordered the food, Bill was incredibly informative as well as clear of the kind of food we may want to order. We had a friend who was dairy free and he was clear on what she may enjoy as well.  Food: I was thoroughly impressed by the menu. There were a myriad of options and unique menu items. I order a pizza called the Biaggia. This masterpiece of a pizza consisted of prosciutto, fig jam, goat cheese, and arugala. At first bite my taste buds were hit with a plethora of flavors without being overwhelmed. While it was on the expensive side for the amount served, I was given a great return in flavor. If I was to give a complaint, it would be that I wish it was a larger serving. With this said, one should know coming in that Italian pizza is thin crusted and generally served for one or two people.  TL;DR With this said, I would highly encourage anyone to try II Bosco Pizza. This restaurant has combined both environment and the food itself for a masterful combo in order to provide the most excellent dining experience. I rarely give five stars, but this restaurant greatly exceeded my expectations. I will be returning soon.  (The pizzas are named after the owner's acquaintances)",

    "text": "Phoenix is a pretty good pizza town, and this place is definitely in the middle of the pack. Nothing really bad about it, but not much stands out either. Honestly, I think my favorite bites were the complimentary starter olives.   My friend and I split an order of fried ravioli and a margherita pizza which was plenty of food, and our whole tab was only $20. The ravioli was fine, but again, nothing remarkable. I liked the pizza, but I felt adding a little red pepper and parm helped the flavor. At better places, I don't have to do that.  I wasn't particularly happy with our server because he was very condescending when I told him we needed our check right away because we were late for a movie. He said, \"You know, no one in history has ever been late for a movie because they were eating at a restaurant.\" Then he proceeded taking his sweet time getting our check and making change. Prior to that exchange, he was much more pleasant.",

I take it this spot depends on word of mouth because you would never know it was there unless you went to Handlebar-J's or paid attention while you hit Jack in the Box at 1am. Anyway wood fired pizza that is excellent, lots of nice combinations, we had the special called \"Juania\" that had spicy sausage, caramelized onions, and Jalapeno. Nice little wine list that had some Italian classics, very affordable bottles no more than $40. Overall a great spot to kickback and have a few bottles and pies. I have to say lastly that the quality of everything was great, extremely fresh and creative combinations on the pizza and apps for example the Caprese salad came with Burratta cheese as well which is something I haven't come across.",

It was unbelievable and they definitely don't skimp on the toppings. I have no problem going out of my way to eat here. It's totally worth it. If every pizza I get here from now on is 80% as good as the one I had I will be eating here forever.",

I used to frequent this place when it was a previous business and owner.  It is completely flipped the mood of the environment and is a great new addition to the neighborhood.  We plan to frequent and often.    Don't ask if they are going to be open to the wee hours as in the past businesses.  It's not gonna happen.  Nice.",

We ate at Il Bosco last night and had a lovely evening.  The outside patio area is very cozy and quaint.  Service was outstanding (Pomo could really take lessons from the Il Bosco servers).  We ordered a Caesar salad to share which the server (who I think may have been the owner) happily offered to split.  Our pizza choice was the Dona which was delicious with melty cheese, perfectly seasoned red sauce, salty pancetta and sliced Roma tomatoes.  Before dinner teasers of delicious olives and fresh sourdough bread with a fruity yummy olive oil to dip in were an excellent appetite opener.  The after dinner homemade amaretto was a perfect ender. During our visit we noticed several take out customers leaving with not just one or two boxes of pizza but three, four and five boxes.  We knew we had arrived at the right place to satisfy our pizza cravings.  Thanks Il Bosco for a great experience.",

This set the stage for everything being made from scratch with fresh ingredients. The gentleman who I presume to be the owner, wearing a plain white t-shirt, and the staff were all very welcoming and non pretentious. The appetizers (meatballs and veggies) and pizza (Adriana + a few extra toppings), were excellent. I have been here both on dates and with my kids (ages 5 and 7) who like to sit at the bar and watch the pizza cooking in the pit. There is a small TV that sits in the corner by the bar which is convenient if you want to see the score of a game, and much more appropriate than an obnoxious big screen on the wall.",

And....they get the most important component of pizza right - the crust.  It's chewy and flavorful at the edges and thin in the middle while still standing up to the toppings and not getting floppy.  My only complaint is that they don't have a margherita pizza on the menu.  In my opinion, the margherita pizza is the True measure of a neopolitan style pizza restaurant, but Il Bosco does not offer one.  Their most simple pizza is this Adrianna, but instead of being dotted delicately with Buffalo mozzarella, it's spread liberally, American-style, with melted cheese.",

The prosciutto layer covering the entire top of it would cost a quarter of the price they ask for it, and the flavors go amazingly well together. The light sweetness of the figs balances the saltiness of the prosciutto, and the olive oil, parmesan, and arugula finish the visual appeal and further melds the flavors together. Incredibly savory all together. Unfortunately, I couldn't really taste any of the goat cheese, and the prosciutto make the pizza difficult to eat without a sharp pair of teeth.   The only cons are $3 for a bottle of water (premium filtered) with no option for free tap water . The lower than expected cost of the pizza evens it out though. That and I ever got to try their bread, don't know why some people got it and I didn't, but maybe it's because we didn't order an appetizer? (confirmed with the owner, the bread is complimentary but is usually served with a starter because they don't think serving bread with more bread (the pizza) really makes sense) The free olives were nice and tasty.",

Wine was just ok, but very reasonable. Server was attentive, helpful and friendly. Owner came by a couple times to check in on us and was absolutely delightful.   Deduct a point for the proximity to the Handlebar J Saloon and the faux-cowboys arriving in limos with 10-gallon hats.

It's location was easy to find and it is a small and inviting. I walked in and was greeted by the owner and I took a seat at the counter which gives you a great view of the Kitchen.I ordered a Caprese Salad and the Biaggia Pizza.  The Menu is small but easy to navigate. My server was friendly and from Chicago as well. The salad came and it was like no other caprese salad I have had including Italy. Fresh Mozzarella along with Barrata Mozzarella which has a creamy center topped with airloom tomatoes dizzled Balsamic and a light touch of pesto. it was served with olives cured in house with several slices of in house made bread. I watched my Pizza being made and it was timed perfectly to arrive just as I finished my salad. The Biaggia Pizza might sound odd but it will be the most AMAZING experience you will have in your pizza eating experience. The dough has a slight wheat taste that compliments the fig jam which is lightly spread on the dough, then goat cheese is added baked to perfection. the pizza is cut and topped with prosciutto slices  on each piece and topped with arugula and evo dizzled on top and some custom house mixture of grated cheese.   You must try this  6 Star Pizza Restaurant. You will not be disappointed by the Food, Service, and Price. It is a valley hidden treasure.",

    "text": "SIRI found Il Bosco for us last summer when we asked for pizza on our way home from Kierland.  There are many good pizza spots near our home, but we are always hoping for something more artisanal.  This small, almost hidden wood-fired  pizzaria was the find of the year for us.  We have brought family and friends many times and have never been disappointed. When our company needed to find a caterer for a two hour event for 100 guests at the Phoenix Children's Museum I did not immediately think of Il Bosco.  The event was to be akin to a happy hour with wine/beer/soda/appetizers.  I really didn't want anything to do with the planning or execution of the event - I am not good at such things and I don't enjoy the process.  It wasn't until after seeing quite a few other options that I raised my voice.  The Phoenix Children's Museum is a wonderfully playful and unique setting and I felt we needed a more comfort oriented option. I remembered the pizza oven on wheels that sits in front of Il Bosco and asked my assistant to call the restaurant to see if Il Bosco offered event catering. We promptly received a catering menu with set prices based on number of guests.  We liked what we saw immediately.  A few days later, I met the planning team at the restaurant for lunch where we were offered samples of 5 or 6 pizzas that could be made on-site at our event.  It was a hit.  We selected a salad option, drinks and desserts. We received a VERY reasonable quote via email immediately.  Bill Forrest, the owner, went personally to the museum to meet with our team and museum staff to coordinate the set up and execution.  Bill offered suggestions without being intrusive and in every way demonstrated a willingness to \"make it work.\" The event came off without a hitch.  The food flowed at a perfect pace - it takes just a minute or two to cook a pizza in that 800 degree oven.  Pizzas were consistently hot and in keeping with demand.  The salad and desserts were top notch.  Everything was perfect.  The sight of a wood-fired pizza oven at the event raised a few eyebrows and added to the anticipation of the evening. The absolute crowning contribution of Il Bosco to the evening was their having the forethought to bring pizza boxes and offering our guests fresh pizzas to take home.  It was a very nice and unusual courtesy as many of our guests had children at home. Il Bosco made us look good.  Our choice of a wood-fired pizza caterer made our event stand out.  Their professional appearance and behavior were exactly what we would have expected.  Il Bosco shines not only as a restaurant, but as a caterer.  Most highly recommended.",

Or in Phoenix.  Or in Arizona.  Hell, the best I've had west of the Poconos (I'd say west of the Hudson River, but there are some REALLY good pizza joints in Jersey).  Can't wait to try their Pananis.  I just keep saying to myself WHY haven't I known of this place before.   All that lost time.  Sigh.",

The salad was yummy too :)    We will definitely be coming back again!  A hidden gem right off of Scottsdale Rd and Shea  LOVED THIS PLACE!!!",

    "text": "The best hidden gem in Arizona. This place doesn't just have the atmosphere that you want for a nice lunch, or romantic dinner, it has the artisan hands-on quality you would expect from the best pizze in Italy.    They give you a plate of in-house marinated kalamata olives that are just to die for. I could eat just the olives all day. They also give you fresh baked bread with the best olive oil you've ever had. At this point in the meal, I was already thinking about my next trip back.   Both the antipasti, packed with flavor and excitement. The meatballs, in an excellent marinara, just perfectly cooked and seasoned. Roasted veggies with burrata, equally as great. The burrata was fresh, light, creamy, and tart; paired perfect with roasted beets. We also tried the special, peppadew peppers stuffed with Italian sausage; one bite of intense flavors perfectly combined. I'd try any special they offered, and I will for future visits.  The wood fired pizze? Amazing, to say the least. We had the Elana, sopressata, olives, amazing tomato sauce, and fresh hand formed mozzarella. I will be back to try every single one on the menu.   I have nothing bad to say about this place what so ever. The owner, who served us, is friendly and very accommodating. They have something very special going on here. They have made a regular out of me.  Update: Went back again today, yes two days later. This is the kind of place where you find yourself saying, \"Yeah maybe I don't like anti-pasti because I've had it before and it wasn't very good\", but you order it here, and it becomes the best thing you have ever had. I suggest, if it's something you wouldn't normally order, order it here, because it may just become the best thing you've ever had.",

I'll definitely be back to try out the rest of the menu. The service was very good as well.  The only negative to the place is the seating is very cramped and it's pretty small in general. Not a huge fan of almost knocking elbows with the people at the tables next to me.  The food and service are outstanding and make up for it however.",

    "text": "Had been trying to get to Il Bosco for quite some time and after eating there last night, I have found I've been missing out.  Tucked in a tiny recessed space directly next door to Handlebar Js (one block north of Shea, just west of Scottsdale Road), Il Bosco is a rare spot here in the Valley - looks and feels much more suited for San Francisco's North Beach or Boston's West End - a quaint, neighborhood feel, a comfortable little space that doesn't try to make you feel like you're in Sicily but rather  is just is what it is - a gourmet wood-fired pizza restaurant that does what they do VERY well.  Not many places here in AZ where the owner greets you at the door and also serves as your waiter.  He also knows his pizza inside and out and took the time to chat with us about the process he uses to make his dough, the fresh baked bread, the construction of his pizza oven and his fresh herb garden out on the patio.  Il Bosco is clearly a labor of love for owner Bill Forrest. He did the entire build-out himself and says its easy to recommend pizza for his customers - \"it's my menu...they are all my favorites or they wouldn't be on there.\"  From the caprese salad's crisp cherry tomatoes, creamy mozzarella and basil grown right there on the property to the two pizzas we sampled (one a standard red sauce, sausage and mushroom; the other at Forrest's recommendation - and something I would have NEVER ordered - was AMAZING...prosciutto, figs,white pizza...insanely good) - the entire experience was PERFECT.  This is a small neighborhood spot with an owner and a dedicated staff trying to make a go with great food and service to match.  This is the kind of place - and the kind of business owners - we want and need in our neighborhood!  Go - and go again. This place is truly AWESOME.",

I am an Italian and I have only been here for a few years, and let me tell you, it is refreshing to finally get a taste of home. The crust is just the consistency that it should be. It's not an American pizza, it's much lighter and not as greasy. I will most definitely return on a regular basis.",

Service is prompt and friendly. My wife and I shared one salad, which we thought was little small, however the lettuce was cold and didn't come out of a bag like many restaurants. They make their own sparkling water which came in a very cold bottle - a nice touch.  Wine selection is small, but reasonably priced. The patio is small, so get there early if you want to sit outside.  We will definitely go back!",

    "text": "My wife and I revisited this place after hearing from multiple people it was of the two best pizza places in the greater Phoenix area. To start, the vibe is great. Very small, tucked away Italian shop where you quickly get the feel that you have known the owner/waiters for months already. Needless to say, the service is great. The owner came by on both our visits and chatted with us about whatever it was we wanted to talk about - this time, restaurant reviews :) Now we ordered a Cesar Salad to share, 3 pizzas between 4 of us (we had guests) and a cookie dessert. The salad was delicious. Very light dressing with farm to table greens. It isn't your typical Cesar though, much more airy. The portion size is on the smaller end. The pizzas are incredible. We tried the classic margarita, Lucia and fig spread one (can't remember the name but definitely their signature pie). It has a classic Italian touch to it but not as thin; more of a hybrid between the thin Italian and doughy New York.",

It was all very cool!  With a staff of 3 (2 people making pizzas and one person serving as a \"hostess\") and enough pizza to serve 20-30 people, the cost was $750.  They also throw in Caesar salad, which was really tasty!  The couple of pizzas I tried were all very well made and tasted really good.  My only gripe was that they charged a $150 \"service fee\" (which is in addition to any gratuities given to the staff), which was not disclosed at any point during the reservation process.  Other than that, the experience was flawless!",

Once the pizza is prepared, it takes 90 seconds to cook in the 700 degree pizza oven. For me, the amount of pizza was perfect. Great flavors, cheese, and sausage. I was also served a small dish of olives which they brine themselves...tasty. To drink I had a red birch beer...very tasty too. The pizza was $7 and a couple of bucks for the birch beer. Very reasonable for lunch in this area.   I'll be back.;)",
