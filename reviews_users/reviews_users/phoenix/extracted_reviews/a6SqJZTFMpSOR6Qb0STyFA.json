    "text": "I am giving this restaurant 1 star for customer service only as I never got to eat there. I had a Groupon to redeem which expired on 2/27. This Groupon clearly said \"reservations required\". I had a friend coming from out of town and we decided we would use the Groupon on the way to the airport on 2/27 (the last day of groupon). On 2/24, I went to their website and made reservations for 3 at 5:30 PM (they use the open table system). I received confirmation and another confirmation/reminder the day before. When I arrived at the restaurant, I was told that there were no reservations allowed. I explained that I had made it  3 days prior and had confirmation, the man at the desk refused to honor it and said that it should never have been allowed because they don't allow reservations on the last 3 days of a groupon (but..groupon said \"reservation required\"). He told me I had to wait over an hour for a table and I explained that we were heading to the airport and could not wait that long. I felt that his attitude was very rude. When I got home and looked at my email I saw that my reservation had been cancelled by the restaurant at 5:26, 4 minutes before the time of the reservation.  I will never go back to that restaurant.",

My husband had the stuffed Cannelloni which he said the steak was so tender it just melted in your mouth. We didn't have dessert because we were full.

The bread is rather ordinary white French bread to be dipped in oil and vinegar.  The cons: The food is very, very slow in coming out and the restaurant was only half full.  Took over half an hour to receive our meals.  Being a cook myself, what I ordered should not have take that long.  The waitress we had was too busy talking to her cronies at the bar to give us much service.  I had to flag her down to get another been and some more vinegar and oil for our bread.  They do not offer any draft beers.  My wife's meal, one of the nightly specials, a seafood ravioli was rather sparse for the $21 price tag.",

I ordered the Rustica pizza (Tomatoes, Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Mushrooms and fresh mozzarella) I liked the flavor of the pizza and the crust was really good but the pizza it's self was pretty soggy in the middle I think it could have been cooked more but for $6.50 it's a deal...

From the live pianist/singer to the cozy booth and candle light to the jovial host, I was immediately impressed.  Then the menu...no crap, just the good stuff, the basics and the prices were pretty good. We couldn't wait to order, but we did. We waited and waited and waited. Finally I flagged down the waiter and asked if we could please order. It's like, \"Um, I would like to buy things from you. Would you like to sell me something?\". It really rightsized my excitement being put on hold like that.   Finally the food!  YUM!  I'll get the chicken parm again.  It was the right size and delish!  So dinner was over and we were ready to pay. Along came the check and there went the waiter. Again we waited and waited until I flagged him down and asked if we could please pay. Again, it's like, \"Hey, I'd like to give you $30 + 20% for your...ahem....service.  Why won't you just come take it???\"  arg!!  Anyway, the restaraunt was great and I'll go back and hope for a different waiter.",

That said, if you go there for date night it's a crap shoot on what kind of service you'll get. One or two of the waiters are surley and inattentive, to the point of being down right annoying. It's a shame because I don't go there as much as I otherwise would.   If you want reliably great service along with great italian cuisine, I'd recommend Ruffino's on Warner as an alternative.",

    "text": "Food - 5.0 Service - 7.0 Management - 0.0  A big disappointment.  I brought my wife and kids here knowing I had a Groupon for $40. It's Mother's Day. We hadn't eaten here before, so a Groupon is a great incentive to try something new. When we arrived it was less than half full at around 6pm. Atmosphere was ordinary, but it appeared that they were professional. Cloth napkins and table clothes and well dressed staff. We ordered our food, which included wine, and rang up at tab just over $100. The food was nothing to write home to mom about, but it wasn't terrible. The quality didn't match the prices, however we knew we had our Groupon, so it made it all palatable. That is until we tried to pay and explained we had a Groupon, but I let him know I would still be tipping on the pre-Groupon total. He frowned and said that they don't take Groupon's on holidays. Having used many Groupons prior at other places, I always check the Fine Print before going. The only restriction it showed was that it couldn't be used during happy hour or in conjunction with other coupons. I showed the waiter this and he still gave me the heisman pose. I asked to speak to the manager, thinking this must be a mistake, and to my great surprise, the manager held his ground stating this was Groupon's policy in the Fine Print. I showed him that it said nothing about \"holidays,\" and he too stood his ground. I decided to take the high ground and save myself and my family further embarrassment and paid the tab (still tipped the waiter well since it wasn't his fault, per se), and here I write. Long story short, what a hustle and great disappointment. Not a great way to get a return customer who racks up $100 tabs for pasta. I've never seen a manager who would choose not only a battle that was wrong, but knowing that we would never return.   I do not suggest supporting this establishment. This is my first YELP writeup.",

    "text": "Ironic that one of the translations of \"arrivederci\" is \"goodbye\" because that's exactly what I'm going to do - kiss this place goodbye!  I want to like this place - I like the environment and Ahwatukee has a severe shortage of variety in restaurants.  But this was the second time we gave this place a chance and it was just as bad as the first.  Our first experience, the service was ridiculously slow.  The waiter got my order wrong and when he finally brought the right order it was cold and my husband was nearly done.  I was hoping for a different waiter this time around to get a more well-rounded experience but sadly that was not the case.  Service was still slow, and communication was severely lacking.  I had to ask for water twice; the second time another waiter overheard and said \"he didn't hear you, but I did - we're low on water glasses right now\" and proceeded to give us water in wine glasses.  Totally acceptable solution, but the original problem should have been provided to us by our waiter.  We never got the specials.  Didn't know they had any until we were midway through our food and overheard waiter #2 telling the table next to us.  The only thing good about the food we got was the fresh bread.  I ordered the tortelloni bolognese and my husband ordered the fettucine alfredo with mushrooms and chicken.  I don't eat mushrooms, but I like the flavor - and in my opinion, mushrooms (rich flavor) and alfredo (rich flavor) seem like an overwhelming pairing and my husband said it was a strange combination.  There was something wrong with my tortelloni bolognese.  How one messes that up, I have no idea.  The sauce was watery, and there was an odd aftertaste in a few bites that were reminiscent of cleaning solvent.  I barely ate half and didn't bother taking it to go.  The tables were squished together; it was a regular occurrence for the staff to bump into each other.  The manager seemed loud and overbearing.  When another table near us also had a subpar experience, he comped their meal but was incredibly brash and loud about doing so.  They left even more annoyed than we did.  They must be doing other things right because the restaurant was full - we clearly just have not been on the receiving end.  However, two chances is all I'm giving.  Arrivederci, Arrivederci.",

    "text": "This looked like a nice place to celebrate my wife's birthday, as she enjoys Italian meals, so we came here to celebrate my wife's birthday with the family (including two children)  Reservation was honored with no wait. Table setting was a bit odd, three wine glasses in a four table setting.  Not that I usually even care about the quality of silverware, but this looked like ones from a school cafeteria.  Bus staff brought water to the table and even put the water in a styrofoam cups for it youngster.  I had incorrectly assumed that almost all restaurants are in some way kid friendly, but this one isn't.  Other than the water, this place is not kid friendly in terms of drinks or food portions.  Started off with fried mozzarella, which was average, nothing fantastic but nothing bad.  Between all of us, we ordered 4 full dishes - lobster ravioli, meatballs all Franco, chicken arrabiata and a cheese ravioli.  Lobster ravioli and meatball dishes were good, with a portion size that matched it's price (well, lobster rav was a special so that jacked up the price).    The cheese ravioli was a disappointment, with just 5-6 raviolis that were easily forgettable.   The chicken arrabiata was an abomination!  The portion was small, the chicken rubbery, the sauce more like plain tomato sauce, and rice that was pathetic.  In reading other reviews of this place now, it seems that they do some dishes well but the chicken (and probably anything paired with rice) is an after thought.   The food took over 45 minutes to get served, and a request for a second serving of bread did not come (it technically did come but we had already received our dinners at that point)  I went home still a bit hungry.  Overall, a poor value and with the consistency of food quality missing, we will not be returning here.",

    "text": "My wife & I went to Arrivederci in Ahwatukee last night to celebrate our 20th Anniversary. We were less than impressed, unfortunately.  We had been there twice before, as we love good Italian, and the restaurant is closer to where we live than other places. Here's what we experienced:  - The waitresses were very good and I don't blame them for anything. Let's get that out of the way.   - The ambience is okay. We were put under a stronger light by the waitress station as opposed to one of the more romantic tables. But it was busy and we came in with no reservation, so we were ok with that, though it wasn't our first choice.   - As we get into the food, understand that the kitchen was ridiculously slow. We were sitting there for 45 mins before we got our entrees (though our appetizer came out in reasonable time). We decided not to send our dishes back because of the fear of the extended wait time again.   - We got the beef carpaccio as the appetizer, it was smaller than I anticipated ... But very good. So  thumbs up there!  - For entrees, my wife got the main eggplant dish & I ordered the Chicken Parm. We waited a loooong time for it. By the time I got it, the Chicken Parm looked and tasted like it was either left under the broiler or under the \"French fry light\" too long. The cheese was brown and the chicken was over cooked. The side of penne looked & tasted like it was right out of the box, but the marinara was nice.  - My wife's eggplant dish was a similar quality. There was a flavor we traced to the cheese on it which she didn't like. She actually said to me \"this is the first time I don't like eggplant.\"  -For dessert, we got the Chocolate Tiramisu. It was good, but seemed store bought.   I wish I could say that Arrivederci over delivered and was wonderful, but that just wasn't our experience. The atmosphere and wait staff were solid (hence 2 stars instead of just 1), but IMHO, the kitchen needs help.",

The host flipped us an expression with attitude which I picked up on quickly. The waiter eventually made his way to the table and we ordered our dinners. He didn't ask us if we wanted salads or appetizers and for what it's worth I am glad he didn't.   When the food arrived 40 minutes later I was ready to walk out. The dinner I had ordered had no shrimp and I asked the waiter what kind of crab was in the dish. Snow crab isn't even in season.  They used artificial crab which is whitefish and god know's what else.   Stay away unless you live in Awatukee and your filty rich and stupid.",

I got cannoli for dessert and it was really small for the price, plus the middle of the shell was hollow. I would never buy it again.  The pricing was high for the ambiance and for what you got; thankfully, we had a Groupon for 50% off. If we didn't have that, I would have felt ripped off.   As for ambiance, the tables were very close together and it almost reminded me of cafeteria style seating. It would not have been good for an intimate date.

When our bill came, I noticed we were charged full price for all items we had ordered when we should have been charged Happy Hour price for some.  Our server said that since we used a Groupon, we had to be charged full price for ALL food.  I was confused why I was being charged full price for Happy Hour items, I am aware Groupon can not be used to pay for discounted items (Happy hour) but we had ordered $60+ worth of regular priced menu items which was more than the Groupon Value.  Our server clarified that if anyone uses a Groupon, the owner mandated that every item ordered be charged at FULL PRICE, regardless if the Groupon value had already been met by other items.  She also confirmed it was because \"the owner needs to make up the cost of running the Groupon so we have to charge at full price.  The deal is so good, you shouldn't mind being charged full price.\"  We were over charged by $15 because of me using a Groupon.  The experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I doubt we will come back because of it.  Hope the extra $15 was worth it for you, Owner.",

Our salads seem to lack dressing but had too many croutons.   I had the fettuccine Alfredo which was tasty, but someone else had a veal dish wish they said lacked flavor.  Dessert was good.  Everything was spoiled as I got near the bottom of my cup of coffee and there was a ring around the bottom of my cup.  Totally grossed me out.

    "text": "I am really quite surprised at the high reviews for this establishment. They truly don't deserve it! I purchased a coupon for this restaurant through my work (after checking the Yelp reviews, of course) so we were excited to give them a try but were sorely let down.  When we arrived the first thing I noticed was the place was empty at 6pm. Well that's not a good sign! We waited for one of the employees to acknowledge us between their laughter and chatter between each other. Once being taken to our table we looked at the menu and couldn't believe the prices; they were extremely high. I told my boyfriend, its a good thing we have a coupon, this better be some dang good Italian food! Due to the high prices, we decided to share an appetizer and an entree, surely it would be plenty, it's an Italian restaurant!   It took about 25 minutes for our appetizer of meatballs to arrive and when it did my boyfriend and I just looked at each other. There were about 6 tiny meatballs swimming in some marinara. I was expecting huge meatballs like what you get at Oregano's...nope, not even close! So we ate, and unfortunately the dish was nothing special. They tasted like they were from a frozen bag. As we were waiting for our entree I had been needing more water but regardless of the empty restaurant no one was checking on us. We waited for our entree another 20 minutes after that. Why was it taking so long? We were the only ones in the dining room. We finally received our entree. What the hell! It was just about the same size as our appetizer!!! There were three small rolls of pasta. Seriously? Did someone eat the other 3/4 of it back in the kitchen? We ate those in about literally a minute and then tried to scarf down some bread to help fill our stomachs. And the worst part, it wasn't that good. At this point I finally was given more water.   Needless to say we would never come back here. Why pay such ridiculous prices for tiny portions of pretentious food with a side of crappy service? No thanks, I'll head over to Oregano's or RigaTonys!",

We got to sit on sofas in what I guess passes for the \"VIP\" section since our friends apparently hang out there a lot. The only downside was the sub-woofers were under the side tables, so it was a bit loud. They had live music, which was cool. The singer was very good and super nice.   We had the Caprese Rustica, not something we'd usually order but our friends insisted. It was sooo good, they make their own mozzarella, which is neat. We also had the Ahi Tuna, so nom! The Ahi was perfectly cooked and very fresh. The last thing we tried was the Calamari in Umido, it was pretty good though I don't know that I'd order it again. It's basically cooked Calamari in a broth, instead of your typical friend calamari. They have a pretty good selection of wine. We went with a Moscato that was delicious!  My only problem with this place is the entrance, I'm pretty sure they have to bribe fire/health inspectors. The bar is just inside the door and there are chairs lining the whole bar. Getting through there to the other side of the restaurant (where the bathroom is) when it's crowded isn't so fun. I'm also pretty sure if there were ever a fire everyone would be trapped by fallen barstools and the bottle neck effect...the food's good enough to risk it though!",

Not only did it come out cold the first time but it was just plain terrible. I would compare the chicken to a soggy lean cuisine dish. It was clearly frozen, processed, breaded chicken. For $18 we were expecting so much more. We overheard a few of the servers suggesting this meal as it was a new addition to the menu. My advice would be to take it off the menu. Its not a quality dish. Very disappointing.",

They do have a Happy Hour from 5 to 7 and live music certain days of the week, but there is separate section devoted to the Happy Hour crowd.  We ordered the Melenzana Arrivederci (Rolled Eggplant filled with spinach & four cheese, served with tomato sauce and pasta).  The eggplant was ok but lacked flavor and the pasta was very inferior with the tomato sauce that was meh....  Also at $16, I would expect alot better.  We also ordered the Penne Alla Pepe e Nero, which was Penne in a lemon black pepper cream sauce with sausage, chicken and eggplant.  Pretty big portion but at $18 it was a fair price.  However, the sauce lacked a fresh lemon flavor and seemed more like a mustard in it for some reason or might have been overpowered with the pepper.  I understand all the pasta and sauce is made in house but the quality seemed like out of a box.  For dessert we ordered the cheese cake which was nothing great to write about either.  Giving it two starts because the service was good and so was our server, otherwise it deserves only a single star.    Even with a GroupOn, there are many good choices around for good Italian Food and will not return.",

I made reservations for tonight at 5pm since I was told yesterday when I called about going in that night they couldn't accommodate me, and I needed to come in the next night.... But whatever.  I found the whole thing odd when I came in tonight and they did not have my reservation, and then laughed at me and said it was probably on a scratch piece of paper in the office.  Awesome.  I would comment on the service, but other than taking my order, it was pretty much non-existent.  Oh wait, they did stop by 30 minutes after taking my order to drop off some burnt bread and to tell me they were having \"printer issues\" and my appetizer would be out soon.  I'm not sure what kind of Jetson's kitchen has a printer that makes my food, but again, whatever.  I waited tables in college, so I know that's code for \"I forgot to put in your order\".  15 minutes after that, my appetizer came out.  In my world, 45 minutes to wait for your appetizer is pretty bad.  And I'm not exaggerating.  It really took that long.    Since I was pretty hungry at that point, the appetizer disappeared quickly.  I honestly probably would have liked it if it hadn't marinated in my bitterness for 30+ minutes, but I wasn't impressed.  I looked at my watch when that was polished off and it took another 30 minutes from that point for the entrees to come out.    Now, really, any entree at that point was pretty much doomed.  Its hard to like anything when your irritated, however, for $19 a pop, I was not pleased with the quality of my entree.  If it's going to take you over an hour to cook it, it better have some freaking pizzazz!  Again, I am quite confident that it didn't take them that long, and they just forgot about me.  I get that, but i have been many places where the way they handle the screw up is so impressive, I come back for customer service alone.  That is not the case here.  Please tell me your sorry, comp something, bring me some wine... Something!!!   And like I said, the food never even stood a chance....  Needless to say, I will never be back.",

I started with the minestrone soup and for my main course I ordered the lobster ravioli with vodka cream sauce.  My 9-year-old also loved the minestrone soup (he ate most of mine) and he really liked the spaghetti and meatballs.   My significant other ordered a salad and the tortellini (both of which he enjoyed).  For desert we ordered the flourless chocolate cake (I cannot remember what it was called) and it was so yummy.

My girlfriend and I arrived at 7:00pm and were seated promptly and given water and complimentary bread. Unfortunately, that is all we had. After 30 minutes of not a single soul coming by our table, mind you there were only 4 tables occupied on a Saturday night, which should have been an indication of low expectations, I proceeded to the bar area to find out what was going on. A blonde woman, who I imagine was in some sort of management role, told me to hold on while she answered the phone and took a takeout order. The guest standing in front of her should have taken precedence. I returned to my table and proceeded to leave and was asked how everything was. I replied, \" All we have had for the last half hour was bread and water.\" Upon getting into my vehicle, she came out and asked what went wrong. I have been in the hospitality industry over 15 years and have never had such a disparaging experience. My girlfriend called as we were enroute to another restaurant and they offered us a free dessert if we came back. Talk about POOR guest recovery. So, if you want an absolutely horrible evening, try Arrivederci in Ahwatukee. It even says it in their name, they need to be Arrivederci from the restaurant scene.",

Although most guest were our seniors and they may have been a bit scared as the soccer team marched past them, the restaurant is normally pretty loud with table conversations.  It's not a huge place and fit plenty of tables in there. The staff took care of 1 table of kids and 1 table of adults and we could not have asked for better service. Food was amazing.  Not the chain restaurant supersized portions (which is a good thing) but they are not small.  They seem to focus on food quality. Chicken and mushrooms was wonderful. Lobster ravioli was really good and not to rich like some others I've had. This is exactly the mom and pop type restaurant we like to support. We would definitely come back, but sans kids next time.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND",

It got to the point where I asked them \"why don't you just tell me what you do have\".   Then they burned something in the kitchen and the smell permeated the restaurant. Nasty.   Food is normally pretty good but nothing spectacular. Service is usually pretty decent as well. We used to love when Tommy was a server there. Not sure where he ended up.

Kind of like plain tomato sauce with red pepper in it and that's it.  Had a cannoli for dessert and it was very good.There was filling throughout the cookie shell. I really hate when you get a cannoli and they stuff it from both ends but the center is hollow, not this one, it was completely stuffed and really really good.

It was 10 layer lasagna with plenty of ricotta cheese and meat and covered in their vodka cream sauce. My friends got spaghetti and meatballs and the chicken pesto skewers. Mine was definitely the best thing ordered, I would not order the other things as they don't seem worth it, although my friends were sayisfieThe main thing I would say is that the prices are a bit expensive and don't totally match up with the niceness of the place. They try to make it seem fancier by closing all of the blinds, which feels a little odd when you go at 5pm and it's still bright as day outside.",

Asked for a high chair, first one the seat belt was missing, so I had to ask the bartender if there was another, second one came and now we are settling in.   I look behind me, the two men who came in before us have waters and menus, the other two who came in after us have drinks and menus...   5mins later....   Well, we have been sitting at our table for a good five minutes now, still without any menus....  3 Minutes later..   I just flagged down a female server for menus, finally got them...   Now we are still sitting here twiddling our thumbs... We know what we want already...  Still sitting here, no server has greeted us or even approached us..  10 minutes later...  And now we have gotten up after wasting our time here and as we are getting up everyone's looking at us.  Oh so NOW we get your attention!

    "text": "This was a nice find. I love little hidden neighborhood eateries that serve great food. Really good authentic Italian food isn't always easy to find in Arizona. But Trattoria Arrivederci (\"farewell\" or \"see you later\" in Italian) is a staple here in the Valley and really offers a nice selection of Italian dishes on their menu. Chef Franco specializes in Nouvelle cuisine which is a more modern way of cooking that presents more lighter and delicate dishes with an emphasis on presentation. Owner Max Sahin helped opened this location in Ahwatukee in 2004 and was pleasant to chat with. When you walk in, you will notice that the lights are dimmed to offer a more intimate setting. The menu consists of a variety of pastas, seafood entrees and appetizers. Items are made from scratch using fresh ingredients and they also have a nice selection of wines to choose from. I took my mother here for dinner on a Friday night. Our server Morgan was a real pleasure to have as a server and really made our night. She shared a bit of her own Italian heritage and was very personable and friendly. I feel like this is something you don't see much in servers anymore. I have never tried lobster ravioli and she sold me on trying it. The dish was outstanding! The saffron cream sauce was nice and smooth and the ravioli are filled with generous portion of lobster tail and crabmeat. My mother got the Canneloni de Carne and really enjoyed it. Overall we had a really nice evening here. Probably my cons of the experience are that the parking can be a little tight and it was a tad bit warm in the restaurant for me (I'll admit I'm a cold weather guy). Arrivederci also has locations in Scottsdale and Fountain Hills.",

TVs over the bar area were visible from the dining side giving it more of a sports bar feel than a romantic one. I had ravioli which was over cooked and had a pretty tasteless red sauce. Actually, it wasn't sauce at all but tomato chunks in a red watery substance. There was another ravioli choice but I couldn't understand the waiter explain the difference: partly his accent, partly acoustics. The bread was ok, nothing special. I had the ravioli, my companion had caprese salad and a beer and it was $35. If you're looking for a enjoyable Italian restaurant for that price, I would head over to Va Bene. You will be much happier.",

Maybe I am being sub-consciously selfish because I don't ever want them to not have room for me when I wish to go. This is my \"go to\" neighborhood Italian restaurant.  My husband gave me 2 choices late yesterday and, of the 2, I chose this. We have been there regularly and they are always very accommodating. Last night we split the eggplant parmesan  appetizer - very flavorful and cut very thin. We each had some hearty minestrone soup followed by this \"melt in your mouth\" lamb osso bucco.  It has been on special before but I have always ignored it. While seating us, a plate for another table went by and it just looked so good, I had to break down and try it. I wish I had a way with words to describe how very tasty it was.  It was served with fettucini (which I believe they make their own pastas) in the osso bucco sauce.  I couldn't finish mine and asked to have it boxed.  We kept waiting and finally I had to ask the waiter where my left-overs went.  He went to check and they had accidentally trashed them but before he came back to tell me, the kitchen had already started on making me a whole dinner to take home. I didn't ask and I would not have asked - they just did it.  That is good management and caring about your customers. In the past, my husband has enjoyed their various fishes and I have always enjoyed their veal. Sauces are good; pasta is always cooked perfectly.  My favorite of all time though they only do on special occasions like Christmas Eve or Mother's Day, and then only if they can get the proper ingredients, is the diver scallops and shrimp in a champagne sauce over linquini. It was chancy for me to try as I do not generally like scallops unless they are fried, but these had a great sear and were cooked to perfection.  Do by all means try this place - just don't get in my way - LOL.",

The description sounded so good and it was, but as I was eating it I wished I would have had some vegetables to go along with it. It is made of sheets of pasta rolled around prime beef cut in small chunks (almost to hamburger consistency) and mixed with ricotta (I think) and covered with tomato cream sauce and cheese then baked. We also shared a piece of the flourless chocolate cake - can't remember what they called it. Perfect ending to a delicious meal.",

We asked for a table as far away from them as possible.  Our waiter was attentive and friendly and quite knowledgeable of the recipes of most of their dishes.  He got very busy towards 7pm and left us for lengthy pauses.  I'm glad we had our food before this happened.  We ordered Chicken Cordon Bleu (Chicken breast, stuffed with ham and fontina cheese, breaded and topped with 4 cheese demi glace sauce served with rice and vegetables), and Cioppino dello Chef, which was a   combination of clams ,mussels , calamari , baby clams and fresh fish in garlic red clam sauce over linguine.  Unfortunately the rice on the chicken dish was cold, but we loved the the rest of this dish.  My Cioppino was more than excellent!  Tons of fresh tasting seafood, lovely sauce and perfectly cooked linguine.  The bread, warm delicious focaccia served with olive oil and a dab of balsamic vinegar called out to us for two baskets.  No room for desert.  The glass of white wine was fresh, fragrant  and had a rich taste.  I take away half a star for the lapse in service toward the end and the cold rice, but since the food was so good I'll leave the 5 stars.  Yes, we will be back!",

Emma ordered seafood  raviolis and I had chicken parmigiana and both of us had a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. Once we ordered our entrees they brough bread to our table. Considering we were eating at an Italian restaurant we expected Italian bread. Instead we were brought a basket of boring tasting pita bread sprinkled with garlic seasoning. The wines came but we had to flag someone down to bring us water. The meals came and then we had to flag someone down for parmesan cheese. My chicken parm tasted pretty good but the tomato sauce on my pasta pretty much tasted like tomato soup. Emma said here raviolis tasted \"blah\". Our dinner bill came to $65. We expected better quality food for what we received. Too many good Italian restaurants to choose from in the area. We're in no hurry to go back.",

The Italian meatball appetizer was tasty, marinara sauce had a nice little zing of spicy to it! For the main dish we tried the penne ala vodka with chicken! Was tasty but honesty I'd skip the chicken next time, had no flavor and an odd consistency.  Overall tasty spot and would come back to try some other things on the menu.  Service was efficient and friendly.",

The woman bartender they had was horrible no smile no hello just pretty much asked us what we wanted then ignored us the entire time we even had  to ask a bunch of times to get our check. I could see that she was busy with her regulars. But never said two words to us the whole time. Plus the food there was HORRIBLE . There's a lot of Italian restaurants around North Scottsdale this was definitely not one of the better ones",

I ordered the Ravioli With Wild Mushrooms and my dinner companion ordered the Penne Alla Pepe e Nero.  The Ravioli was just OK.  The pasta was done correctly, however, the filing was mushy and flavorless and the sauce was very watery.  My companion's dish seemed a little better.  He seemed to enjoy his more than I did mine.  The bread was pretty good.  Served with oil and balsamic.  I also ordered a simple Cesar salad on the side, which was $8 and had almost no flavor.  The greens were fresh, but it was not flavorful at all.  All told, the service was good.  The food was mediocre.  The total for two dishes of pasta, one side salad and two glasses of wine was $66 before tip.  I will have to continue my quest for a great Italian place in the area .",

However, I will say this is literally the worst Italian food I've ever had in my life. I ordered the penne arrabbiata. The pasta tasted like it was from a box and it wasn't cooked fully. The salmon tasted like it was unfrozen from Food City and topped with the same bad sauce as was on the penne pasta. The sauce was so unbelievably bland. It tasted like a can of crushed tomatoes with red pepper added and garnished with parsley flakes.   They were very friendly on the phone when we ordered and when we picked up the food. I had been really excited to try this place for quite some time. We typically frequent a few other local Italian spots. I want to say I would give them another chance, but it was on the expensive side for what we got.   My star score is purely based on food taste, not service.",

We went straight back to the bar area and saw a couple open tables, a few spots open at the bar and the couches were empty.  Made a bee line for the couches and waited. And waited.  One of the tables right in front of us already had a couple people sitting at it and the other table was empty.  A bus boy came by and brought us water and we had to ask for menus. 4 older people showed up and sat at the other empty table.   The male server came out a couple of times and greeted the 4 new people and had drinks delivered to the other table that was already there.  My companion was ready to leave after about 10 minutes of being ignored.  I finally flagged down the male server again who finally came over but I don't understand how he could miss us as we were sitting right there on red couches.  Ordered the meatballs and the mussels/clams. Bread was yummy, other food was yummy, but being ignored really turned us off.  We'll see if we give it another go, another time.",

    "text": "*unbuttons jeans* I really need to invest in a pair of maternity clothes so I can leave here comfortably. So, started off with the Meatball Arrabiatta appetizer. Sounds generic but, I promise you, their spicy marinara makes all the difference, especially when you use the warm bread to dip it in *heavy breathing*. Anyway, main course for me was the Fussili Alla Pepe e Nero, which was amazingly seasoned and perfectly creamy. Not a huge fan of eggplant but I now know it's because I've never had it so well prepared or paired. My husbands Gnocchi Pesto was also delicious. Creamy but not over powering as I know some pesto sauces tend to be. The Argirio wine probably wasn't the one to go with for these particular dishes but still tasted delicious (side note- this wine is 15% alcohol). Our waiter, who was also fantastic, brought us out a shot of his own creation which was a lime cucumber godly vodka concoction which was a deliciously unexpected treat. As full as we were and in our tipsy \"we can do anything\" state of mind, we opted to try their Chocomisu, which is like tiramisu but instead of a coffee taste, its chocolate, it was the perfect way to finish off our meal. *glorious flashback* overall, wonderful experience. Not to forget the atmosphere is fantastic. Dont let the size of the outside fool you, it's a lot bigger once inside.",

The restaurant started out with a bang - great food and terrific service - and has gone downhill ever since.  For the last several times my husband and I went there, it has consistently disappointed. A shame because it has so much potential.  My husband and I started at the bar on Friday night, then decided to move to a table.  No offer to help move placemats, silverware.  My husband spilled his drink on the move & asked the waitress for help.  She shoved a dirty, smelly rag at him.  We asked for napkins twice to no avail.  Sat at a table with an unlit candle - as most of them in the place were - and stared at a big, 1970's looking screen with nothing at all playing on it.  Little things - but as a former restaurant owner myself - these things add up to a lackluster expereince.  The gnocchi had its usual good flavor but the sauce was drippy & watered down.  Our waitress actually took her shoes off and changed to flats in full view of all customers - while rubbing her bare feet followed by no hand washing - then proceeded to serve food..yeeech.   Mind you, we are regulars - and BIG TIPPERS - yet the bartender couldn't change the tv station to the Arizona game????  Bored wait staff, no ambience.  Max the owner used to at least be there - servce lemoncellis with your bill, liven up the place, make sure customers are taken care of...no more.  It's the food and it's the service - they need to go together to make repeat customers.  Sad that we can't just seem to get that in Ahwatukee... -        +",

I found the roasted peppers to be a bit overwhelming, BUT... the mozzarella was -by far- the best I've had in a looooong time.  You know how most mozzarella (except, amazingly, the cheap 'string cheese' kind) is absolutely flavorless?  Even when advertised as 'fresh' or 'bufala'?  Well, the mozza here was wonderful - once you separated it from the peppers, it was simply delicious.    The boyfriend had some kind of cannelloni with beef in a white wine tomato sauce.  The sauce was incredible... extremely well balanced, you could taste the wine and the tomato.  Just lovely.  When asked, he said his food was 'really quite good'. (Coming from him, that's a 4-star review.  He's not a foodie.)  I had ravioli with portobello mushrooms in a brown sauce.  If you're a 'shroom fan, you'll love the dish.  The ravioli were large and soft, the filling was super tasty and the sauce was awesome.  I had to order more bread to sop it up, it was so yummy.  Service was very good - our waiter was attentive, but not obnoxious, and we were able to enjoy a leisurely meal even on a busy Saturday night.    We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "For food, I think the place is overrated.  For a wine bar with occasional live entertainment it's a green light.  On the restaurant side tho, I ordered lobster ravioli which was a featured dish at the time.  Did I taste any chunks of lobster?  No.  Were they overstuffed?  Not even close.  The vodka sauce was tasty but no lobster chunks there either.   If you want a salad it is a separate dish to pay for.  This lobster ravioli was priced around $21.  Was there $21 worth of food there?  Absolutely not.  The portion to price ratio is VERY skimpy.  I have had a better portion in a can of Chef Boyardee. OWNER: if you are reading this, you need to invest in a warming drawer.  I have been to your restaurant twice now and both times the food has arrived bordering on COLD.  It's the least you can do for people dropping $20+.  Please serve it hot, (this shouldn't be much to ask for?). Nice small, cozy, environment but the tables are very close together.  About average service.  You will get more for your money and a bit tastier at Buca Di Beppo across the freeway.  I won't be back here, I cannot stand cold pasta dishes and really don't enjoy throwing hard earned money away on mediocre meals.",

I've had dinner here (or tried to), a handful of times now in the bar area, and the one thing that is consistent is the slow service. The most recent time was a week or ten days ago - 10/18/14. We stopped in at Arrivederci and the bar side of the restaurant was quiet. There was one four-top, one two-top and two separate individual people at the bar. We just wanted to have a glass of wine and decide on where to head for dinner. The bartender seemed to be buried, although we didn't understand why considering there were only 8 or so people in the entire bar area. It was ALL he could do to take our drink order. We laughed about it when he arrived breathless at our table to see what we wanted. The four-top was right next to us and they had food delivered and were complaining about how long it took. Also, it took them three requests for water to actually get the water. Well, it smelled GOOD and we were hungry so we figured we weren't in a hurry, why not eat here? However, the bartender never came back. Once he asked us from across the bar if we wanted more wine then brought it over, set the wine down and went on his way, didn't ask us if we wanted menus or an appetizer or anything. We laughed it off and gave up, paid the tab by bringing our credit card to the bar and then went on our way.",

The service there is hit or miss at best! The reviews that have been posted over the last two years commenting on the service are pretty much spot on, and apparently dismissed by the management. The waiters are not attentive, not accurate in their ability to get the order right and generally absent. I have decided we will not be returning to this establishment any time soon, if at all.  It truly is a shame because the food and atmosphere are great but the service is horrible, with what you pay there should be some level of service.  Food is good service is very poor.",

Appetizer Mediterranean sliders came and were over cooked and dry. They smelled off & we mentioned to server who said they are Mediterranean and smelled different. We each ate one and at 2:00 am wished we had not The Veal Gorgonzola $ 20.00 was a huge disappointment too.  The veal was all uniform in size and thickness like when you buy lunch meats! Not sure it was veal as it was tasteless and swamped in a yellow sauce that didn't allow you to identify the meat.  It was accompanied with 9 yellow soaked pieces of pasta.",

We were thanked upon leaving the restaurant. I had the Vitello piccata con carciofi( veal piccata) and my dining partner had the minestrone soup and salmone vesuvio(salmon.) .Both came with rice and veggies. They were delicious. I had the pistachio tartufo( gelato )which was very good and the other dessert we tried was the spumoni. Prices for our entrees were $18 & $19. and dessert was $7.

The only thing keeping it from a one is the fact that it was clean.  We called for a reservation in which we were told that they didn't take reservations for two.  When we got there, tons of spacious 4 seater tables were available but they stuck us back in a two seater wedged literally a food between two other tables.  When we asked to be moved they indicated that they had a lot of four person reservations but if the tables were open after a few minutes we could move.  We were never offered those other tables which stayed open the entire 90 minutes we were there.  Then when the couple next to us left we asked again to move one table over.  They indicated that it was reserved and we could not move.  Again two people were seated at the table.  Not sure how that happened since they said policy indicated that they didn't take two person reservations.    So if seating doesn't bother you and you've rolled your eyes and skipped over the top section let me discuss the below par food.  We ordered the chicken cordon blue.  Let's just say that if I closed my eyes and took a bite of chicken mcnugget and one of arrivederci's chicken cordon blue bites I would not know which was which.  My vegetables that accompanied my dish were mostly just a pile of red onions.  To top it off my \"famous\" crab cake was more mayonnaise than anything else.  However, my husband enjoyed his stuffed shells.    The experience and food we got was not worth the 70 dollars we paid and I will never come back here again.",

The groupon stated you must call in advance by phone (not on open table) and make a resv to use the groupon.  It also said one groupon per table and there were 2 couples that went here that evening.  When I called the day before our dinner I was told by a man on the phone (sounded Italian...but then again, everyone at this place sounds Italian and I think they fake that accent, by the way!) there is no need for a resv for 4 at 6:30 PM...\"just come-a in-a (that's the Italian accent).\"  So that is what we did.  And WHEN we got there the place was pretty much packed!!  The first question out of the host's mouth, \"Ummm....do you-a have a reservation?\"  I nearly lost it.  However, after my 1.5 min rant about TRYING to make a resv in advance, they quickly seated us at a table for 4....in the crammed, wee corner of the place right by the front door and host station and in front of the line where servers pick up food.  But at least it was a table!  The server was friendly.  We had brought a dozen cupcakes to celebrate my friend's birthday and they stored them for us in the back since the table was the size of my hand.  We ordered a bottle of sangiovese....that came with a screw top cap (not corked) and was so so.  I had the penne pasta with chicken and vodka sauce.  Pretty good and HUGE portion (took most of it home).  Mid way through dinner my husband looked over his left shoulder and then pointed out the 3 inch cockroach crawling on the floor about 4 feet away from our tiny table!!  Ewwwwwwww.  I know every restaurant has cockroaches but it was gross.  We did not order dessert because we had the cupcakes and we couldn't stop thinking about the cockroach.  Server was kind enough to let us use BOTH groupons, even though it did state one per table.",

    "text": "I'm torn between shouting from the rooftops about how much I love Arrivederci's happy hour and keeping it as my own little secret so it doesn't become overcrowded.  Well . . . here it goes, fingers crossed!  We had been here for dinner a few times and were very pleased, we decided we needed to try their happy hour.  I'm so glad we did; this is one of my new favorite quiet happy hour spots.  Not quite as trendy as Va Bene, but that's a good thing.  Less of a singles scene, less noisy and the food is just as delicious!  Happy hour is M-F 5-7.  We walked in a few minutes after 5 and were greeted by a very friendly bartender.  He kindly brought us menus and explained that during happy hour all wines by the glass are $5.  Wonderful!! He brought us some water (with a slice of cucumber, nice touch), took our drink orders, and gave us a few minutes to decide on food.  In addition to the wine specials, there are happy hour food specials! Half off bruschetta, pizza, and other appetizers.  We went with the Calamari In Umido (large tube calamari sauteed in white wine & clam broth with a touch of tomato) and the Margherita pizza. They make their own mozzarella here, people!!  Before we received the appetizers, the bartender gave us some fresh bread with oil and balsamic to snack on.  The calamari came out first and it was fabulous, as was using the free bread to sop up the amazing broth!  Then came the pizza and while it didn't blow me away, it was still very good and that mozzarella is so creamy and fresh!    As embarrassed as I am to admit it, we got three rounds of that yummy bread to use for that delicious broth of the calamari.  The best part, the bartender didn't seem to mind a bit that we were being a little greedy with the free bread!  What a nice guy!  Did I mention the bread and broth were delicious?  The bar area is nice with a small-ish size bar and a few high-top tables.  My favorite part was the living room set up past the bar.  Some comfy couches and a projection screen.  I can't wait to plan a friendly group happy hour so we can lounge around on the couches drinking wine and snacking on appetizers.  The service was great, the food was great, the price was right, and the atmosphere is cool and cozy.  What more can a girl ask for?  A couple more times like this, and this is a five star rating . . . easy!",

They bring bread with oil- great bread, the oil is good - not the best-best, but very good.  I ordered the Cioppino, which although delicious, was not typical of what I'm used to.  It was served thick, over pasta. Usually I'm used to it being a full soup.  My friends got the penne vodka, and the other ordered a pasta/seafood dish.  For Arizona - the seafood and fish options are on-point. Mine was very very good, thick sauce, full of flavor. Not the traditional dish I expected, but absolutely a pleasant surprise!  The portions are very generous. I enjoyed my leftovers for lunch AND dinner the next day (granted I did fill up on the bread).  Wine pours are very generous. House chianti was very tasty and complimented my meal perfectly. The wine list itself is obvious to be matched to the menu. I'd love to try the lobster bisque there - usually when its on the menu of a good restaurant, it is very good.  I'll definitely be back, even though it is on the other side of town.  It was a great meal. I'll be honest, I was not expecting much.  But to find good italian food, with good service and great meals in Awhatukee, that surprise is very much welcome!",

The water we got right off the bat had cucumbers in it - which reminded me of the movie \"The Other Guys\", and it was tasty enough that I didn't order a beverage.  Our waiter recommended the grilled eggplant appetizer, which, up to this point in my 36 years, is the best eggplant I've ever had.  The fresh marinara served on top of it was nothing to scoff at, also some of the best I've ever had.  For the main course I got the spicy penne w/ chicken and sausage, what was most impressive about this was the serving size.  I had enough for a full meal on Saturday for lunch, and it was better the day after once the flavors had time to marry.  The wife got the veal picatta - and said it was probably the best she had ever had outside of Italy.  The complimentary flatbread was warm and delicious, and their homemade gelato was the perfect capper.  We were waited on by the GM, who had a great sense of humor and was was one of the 1st waiters EVER to happily take our groupon - explaining that he's happy to know his marketing is working.  Go check this place out, groupon or not!  MOLTO BUONO!",

I was surprised that they were not ready for customers. We did not receive bread for over a half hour and the first basket they brought was actually burnt.   We had the grilled eggplant as an appetizer and it was delicious. My son had the Pollo Parmigiano and of course, as a teenage it devoured it :-) I ordered one of the chefs special that include Italian sausage and chicken in a penne pasta. It was good but a little salty.   Overall I would return but would ensure I did so at a later time in the evening.",

We ordered two rounds of drinks and four appetizers to share. The food and drinks were average, but the service was terrible. The waitress was rude and made us feel bad about asking for more bread. She had a serious attitude problem. We asked for two refills of bread to use with the sauce from our appetizers; she made us feel like we owed her an explanation to why we wanted more. We weren't just freeloading but she made us feel like we were. Between her and the average, yet overpriced, food...it's safe to say we don't want to come back.",

The food was overpriced for the quality, presentation and service were so-so and we found it the restaurant lacking in ambiance.  There were few patrons on this visit.  We were asked to join friends there after a concert in early Dec. because they frequent the restaurant.  Our friends were greeted by, I'm guessing, the manager who proceeded to boast about his restaurant experience once we were seated.  It was early evening and once again, few patrons in the restaurant but a few at the bar.  Our young waitress was only in her 2nd week of training and I could tell she was intimidated by the 'manager' shadowing her.  I choose to use patience with people who are learning their job because I, too, was a newbie more than once.  Without going into details, I will say that the 'manager' was so rude to the waitress while she was taking our orders that I asked him to please leave the table by 'going over there' (finger point) and allow her to do her job.  He did.  It took a very long time to get our food which left much to be desired.  That wasn't the waitresses fault!  Now, I'm sticking to my original guns and will not return to this place.",

She checked on our readiness to order a few times and was very attentive. The food and service was worthy of a four star rating. All four meals served looked very appealing and tasted wonderful!!! The atmosphere and decor is where Arrivederci needs some TLC. The doors to the restaurant and bar areas were confusing (due to the tinted windows). They had past award frames sitting in the window (and in our opinion, should have been hung somewhere inside). The lighting was pretty dark and there was a big metal cabinet with some boxes/supplies right by our table. The pathway back to the bathrooms had supplies and other materials along it and made that area of the restaurant look subpar and junky. We would go back more for the food than the ambiance. I think if they cleaned things up and did more with the decor, I could easily rate this 4-5 stars.",

I ate there last night, and for me, it was a Jekyll & Hyde experience.  I ate there four weeks ago and it was a wonderful experience.  I had Emily as a server, I asked for a couple of substitutions on the three meals I ordered and she was very accommodating and very friendly.  She even, without my asking, gave me quite a bit of their wonderful pizza bread to bring home.  The bread is a real treat.  Last night, however, Emily wasn't working and my server was an older fellow who paid very little attention to me.  I constantly needed to ask for refills on my Iced Tea.  Unlike Emily who was always watching my table and at least three times during my meal, she asked if everything was OK.  No such luck last night.  To top everything off, one of the substitutions I requested was for meat sauce instead of marinara sauce on the ravioli dish I took home.  The server said OK and I thought it was.  But, when my bill came, I was charged $3.50 for a side of Bolognese sauce.  When I asked what that was for, the server told me that meat sauce was more expensive than marinara and that was what the charge was for.  I was floored - Emily didn't do that I said.  But he insisted.  I told him, that if there was an upcharge he should have told me up front.  I left an angry man, and the tip reflected that.  When I got home, while putting my two extra meals away, they felt lighter to me.  I opened the containers, and sure enough the portions were about 60% of the size they were on my first visit.  I am really confused about the difference.  But, Vivala Emily!!!!!!!",

We changed up the order to no vegetables; instead, we wanted spaghetti with the same wine lemon sauce.  We specifically said we both wanted the same thing.  When our order was brought to our table, by the same person who took the order, she only brought us one plate.  We told her we both ordered the same thing. She wanted to know if we wanted to put in another order.  We declined because we wanted to dine at the same time.

    "text": "My wife and I thought we would try this restaurant.  I love Italian food.  We went relatively early so the place was nice and quite.  It has a great atmosphere inside.  I ordered the lasagna which was one of the specials and my wife had the antipasto plate.  She was very unhappy with the antipasto plate: one of the salami's was way to spicy for her to eat, the cheese on the plate was very hard, and there was nothing to use to dip in the hummus.  She only at a fraction of what was on the plate.  The lasagna I ordered was definitely not what I expected.  I ate less than a fourth of it because it seemed to be nothing but noodles and hamburger meat.  I was unhappy that there wasn't more red sauce in the lasagna.  Also, I have eaten lasagna a lot and I just couldn't choke down more than a few bites because it was so dry and funny tasting.  I am not sure that we would try this restaurant again.",
