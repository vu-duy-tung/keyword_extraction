They have a DJ every Tuesday, they also do 10$ buckets of beer, 2$ margs, 2$ rumchata, and 2$ beers. Besides a great happy hour (or happy day if it's Tuesday) The atmosphere alone is worth dropping by. We got a bucket of beer (6 beers) 3 tacos, and chips and salsa for under 20$. Were still sitting here and planning on stay for quite awhile. There are lots of families with little ones as well as a drinking crowd. The bartender was incredibly friendly as was all the staff. You can tell they really enjoy working here. It feels like we're on Sandy Beach in Rocky Pointe, Mexico and I loooove it! Thank you Espos for an amazing Taco Tuesday!!",

The salsa bar offered multiple salsas: verde, pico de gallo w jalapenos , avocado sauce, radishes & grilled jalapenos, habanero salsa, & a squeeze bottle full of spicy red pepper salsa!!! Chips & salsa are al la carte but well worth the $3.25. They were served warm in a bucket. Tuesday's they offer all beers for $2, can't beat that! Highly recommend! Can't wait for the next time I visit, I'll be coming back here!!!",

In a sea of Macayo's and Garcia's sometimes it's hard to find the True Homestyle flavors that I have come to love , so it is not often that I am impressed with a new Mexican restaurant that I try. Espos is by far the best representation of Arizona - Mexican Cuisin that I have ever had. I Have now eaten here three times and each time I am more impressed.  Of particular note is the green chili beef. This is the best I've ever had and I make an incredible green chile myself! If you too enjoy the type of food  Arizona natives grew up on then you must try Espos! They also have great taco Tuesday deals.",

    "text": "I cannot believe this is my first time here after living in Chandler for 15 years!! Yowza it's awesome! Okay, so we ventured out on a Tuesday, Taco Tuesday that is. They said they have been here for 50 years.   There was a little bit of a wait to get to placing our order. But it was no big deal at all. They were moving quickly. Standing in line I knew it would be good. Lots of people in the restaurant and lots of to-go orders. Drinks came out quickly. I had enough time to hit the toppings bar, and have a couple sips of my drink and tada the food was ready.   You will likely meet the owner also- they are constantly taking care of the front of the house, cleaning up, and talking to guests. Definitely feels like family here. We had the 10 for $10 tacos, quesadilla, chips & queso with jalapeno. You choose your meat-ground beef, chx, carne asada, machaca beef, and carnitas. You can mix can mix and match however you like. They have a toppings bar to choose your salsas, etc. Or you can order a side of something else for toppings; guac, cheese, and so on. As well as the $2 margaritas. I've had margaritas from just about everywhere and these were great. They tasted so fresh, not that heavy syrup-y sweet and sour like other places. We tried both peach and raspberry. So good!   Initially, we sat inside and did not notice it being hot or needing a/c like another reviewer said. It was very comfortable. A table on the patio became available and we ended up eating on the patio. They had a DJ and music out there so the vibe was fun and relaxed. Just perfect.   I would go here ANY day of the week with family, friends, co-workers or anyone for that matter!! Their regular prices are really good and I can't wait to try more items next time.",

Based on other trusted reviews, I got it in a burrito enchilada-style, Christmas sauce and really enjoyed that.  I would get that again anytime.    Then I got just a ground beef hard shell taco because I love the crunchy tacos and this one was simple and perfect.  The shell held up well, and was stuffed full of nicely seasoned meat and cheese, lettuce, & tomatoes.  For those 2 items it was $10.36 after tax.  (It's a buck fifty to make it Christmas)  Someone was a little slow greeting me and taking my order at the counter, but it wasn't like they were goofing off back there.  I could tell they were busy making delicious food.  It would have been nice if the dude industriously filling the napkins would have said something, but hey, they have those napkins full before the lunch rush.  The gentleman who did take my order was friendly and funny.  I had a great lunch and will definitely be back.",

I went at about 5:30p, seen the small parking lot was full (additional parking in the dirt behind the concrete parking lot). Walked in and was greeted by a line of hungry people who know good grub. The cashier was very fast! So I got threw the line in about 5 mins (where the heck do you get that!?). Soon enough, my number was called after about a 10 min. wait.   I wouldn't say this is the best place for brining a large group. The place is cozy size - but it's a new favorite spot for food to-go.",

Glad I finally stopped. We came right before a crowd. Ordered two combo plates 1. Red Burrito enchilada style 2. Cheese enchiladas and added 2 ground beef tacos. Also ordered a soda as I noticed they had Big Red. Everything comes out in a to go round including their salsas (red and green). This works for me b/c I always order too much and need a container to go. Okay, the bad-Big Red tasted terrible. Ended up with a coke which tasted okay. The Good-the enchilada sauce. It is flavorful and spicy. The taco was good, the rice and beans were also. They were a bit bland but I prefer rice and beans this way b/c I add salsa to mine. Service great-quick and efficient. Hardly any wait time. Friendly too. Overall, will definitely be back and would drive if I was craving it. I live by So. Mountain.",

If Espos wants to be great talk to your customers!  Also really the chairs in this place get dragged across the floor and are loud as hell and the tables are dirty and sticky.

The cashier says \"Nacho Supreme\", \"Yes\"!!   Generally, their nachos come with ground beef & includes as a topping -black olive. Asked for Carne Asada & opted out of the black olives.  Waited about 15 minutes to receive our meal. It came in a round foil aluminum pan. Toppings: cheese, refried beans, fresh guacamole, canned jalapenos, & a huge dollop of sour cream. The chips were extremely thin; not great tasting & looked to be a bagged type- not fresh. The nachos itself even with all those layers were very bland.  They have one salsa that's mild and not to flavorful.  The outdoor patio had a nice appeal with plenty of cool water misters. Cute decor. The BAR is eye catching as you walk through the gate.   A plus, they do sell beer! Offer two style juices that look to be made in house.  While we ate browsed through their photos & a few of the previous Yelp reviews. Seems this place had more options/ appeal a few years ago that have changed with their new concept after reopening.   Dinning area is small  & location can be difficult to get in & out of as well.",

The spicy sauce was just hot but lacked depth.",

We visited on a Friday night and the place was packed with a line going out the door!  Best to visit during a non-busy time as during busy times it gets very loud at the inside seating area.  And for those visually challenged people like me, there is an unexpected step up after entering, so be careful.  Best to have a sighted guide to help you.",

    "text": "Screwed..... literally..  First off I love eating at Espos and have been for many years. This review is not meant to bash them but to make others aware of what happened to me. The food itself is actually one of my go to for takeout Mexican food.   On Friday November 24th my family was over so we ended up ordering takeout from Espos which equated to about 8 plates of food with chips and salsa.   Everything tasted great as usual from Espos. We were not able to finish all the food and a untouched beef Enchilada combo plate was left over. I decided to take the untouched combo plate for lunch at work on Monday. During lunch break when I was about to take my second bite. I noticed a large screw inside the shredded beef. No joke pictures below.   I was not upset but concerned for others chipping teeth on metal. I contacted Espos and the female on the other end said they were missing several screws from a device used to cook or slice tomatoes. After describing the screw she apologized to me and offered free food. My goal wasn't to get free food and frankly was not hungry for Espos at that time.   I wanted to warn them about the metal and potential injury to customers. Sounded like they were aware of missing metal screws and she told me it was not just one screw but several.   In talking to the female at Espos I asked her if she wanted me to bring the screw in. She said she would really like that. The next day I took it to the restaurant and asked for the manager. The female cashier said the manager was busy and I showed her the screw. This was the same employee I spoke to over the phone and  told me the manger was upset and never took down my name or any information.   Even though I love the food it's disappointing that it happened.",

    "text": "Despite having grown up in Chandler/Tempe/Ahwatukee for over 20 years, I've fallen behind on the local food scene. Quite a bit has changed in the past 2 years, and it seems like its all for the better. Espos food tastes like your 90 year old grandma is in the back cooking for you, and you alone. The food is savory, filled with depth and flavor, and feels unique. There's no shortage of taco shops in Arizona, but Espos has done something completely different and is what I would call \"Mexican Soul Food\".  The menu is a little daunting and complex, but its essentially 4-5 different fillings (green/red chile shredded beef, carne asada, chicken, etc) in 4-5 different shells (chimichanga, burrito, enchilada, tacos, etc). There are plenty of combinations to keep things interesting and fresh. Based on Yelp reviews/pictures it felt like the consensus was to go with a chimichanga, and since green chiles are apparently in season, my final choice was a green chile beef chimichanga. I owe a lot to my fellow Yelpers who guided me to a blissful destination. I've never been so happy in my life. The deep fried chimichanga is crispy on the outside, hot on the inside, and topped with tomatoes, lettuce, and sour cream. Despite being deep fried, it doesn't feel too heavy. The homemade salsa is smoky and complex in flavor. It brings enough heat to satisfy even the most insane chili freaks, but it provides enough depth to those who are averse to spices and are likely to use salsa more sparingly. I was a little disappointed on the amount of beef in my burrito as it was combined with beans, but I'll live. My uncle on the other hand probably got too much chicken in his chimichanga, so maybe I just need to get that next time?  I loved it so much I came back for breakfast a few days later only to see they weren't open at 8 am. I should have checked the hours. Overall, this is a great place to hang out with some friends and enjoy an amazing meal.",

There were so many seeds and skins in the sauce, it was inedible. It ruined my beans and rice as well and I went home and threw out my left-overs.  I Never Do That!  The salsa was ok, too. Just ok.

Located just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the Chandler Fashion Center to be relaxing, yet close enough to keep you in the action, this is that \"off the not-so beaten path\" restaurant you need to experience.  Flavorful and mouth watering food, such as, their chicken burrito (I added their green chili sauce) has kept me coming back for more. They serve breakfast burritos ALL DAY! Also offering tacos, flautas, tostadas, quesadillas, taco salads (and supra), enchiladas, chimichangas, and beers to ensure you get your money's worth.  Speaking of money, their prices are very good for the quality and portions. Friendly staff welcomes you with warm smiles as they take your order from the counter. Pick your table from the cozy inside or from the scenic patio (with bonfire pit) and after a few quick moments of enjoying the atmosphere, your food will be ready for you to devour!

Also, the price is right!!",

Great place for patio tacos and a bucket of beer! All the food is prepared fresh as ordered. Not a microwave to be seen or heard in the building. Damn now I have to go get a burrito!",

    "text": "If i could give zero stars, id do it in a heart beat. I am the party planner for my team at work and someone suggested you guys as an option, remind me never to let that happen again!!! They are great for personal orders(maybe) but DON'T EVEEVVVEEERRRR go here for ordering more than 2 peoples food at a time on one ticket. I called in an order for about 15-20 people, everyone mostly got a burrito/rolled tacos so we didn't think it would be that bad... I told her everything the team ordered, including if they asked for no cheese on their stuff because we had about 4 people that could not eat it(allergy's and lactose) . First of all, after it was all said and done, the order was NOT repeated to me so I think that was the first mistake. When i went to pick up the food, it was so busy the lines were out the door so i cut them some slack. I waited for about 15 or 20 minutes after the time they said it would be ready. I work about 8 miles away from ESPO's and I have to use my own car and gas to drive out there and back. When me and another coworker picked up the food and drove back, we realized about more than half the teams food was wrong. Of course, I got talked to and bombarded because of this issue, like i shouldn't be able to trust ESPO's with not messing MOST of the order up. One or two mistakes, okay I get it but this was too much!!!! I spoke to an employee who said they would be able to refund some of the tacos and burritos so I could use it for gas which was not very much as all. They remade the stuff they messed up and sent me on my way, it was my mistake not to check it again. When I got back and my coworkers told me the order was wrong again, I got so mad, I was on the verge of just grabbing all of the food and get a whole refund. Was this really worth the hassle? Only 2 people got the food out of the 4 that was missing, even the people who had their food right said the burrito was REALLY soggy.  I called in again and i really wasn't the nicest, the manager stated, \" I would hate to ask you to come back again but I don't know what else I can do.\" I told him he either refund the whole order or remakes the whole thing for the next day. I spoke to my manager who said to decline the option of remaking the whole order again for the following day because he was afraid they would go as far as spitting in the food for as bad as the service was. Would you drive back a third time??? NO! He then said he didn't think it was fair at all since they refunded a small amount of the food and remade the food missed. At this point, 200$ for these meals was way over pricing everything i went through with this restaurant and how upset my employees were at me. It was such a bad experience, i shed a few tears and I can hold myself together pretty well so it says a lot! The manager's name was BETO, please take my word for it, DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS ITS JUST YOU!!! :( I really wish they would have just remade the whole order, their food is good when they take their time. I lived across from this restaurant for 8 years, almost my whole childhood until my mother moved 4 years ago. It was good then, WHAT HAPPENED, GUYS!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!!? We could have been ESPO's favorite/best paying customers....now another company gets our money. I am a such an idiot for tipping you guys 10$, If i could i would come get it all back. The worst part about this was that my food was right but when i got back, it was so cold that i ended up having to throw it away. i benefited NOTHING from this besides 4 hours off of the phone WHERE I ACTUALLY MAKE MY MONEY!!!  Thanks ESPO's for costing me more money than I paid for!!!!! Horrible experience.",

I go back to the restaurant and the manager simply says sorry, throws away the quesadilla and my receipt and brings out another quesadilla with chicken. It is with the shredded chicken that is dry and something I do not like and did not want.  So I drive twice to espos only to be extremely disappointed in the customer service and the unwillingness to solve my problem. Unfortunately, this has left a bad taste in my mouth and I won't be back for quite sometime.",

When i went outside, around the building to go to the bathroom a restaurant staff was pushing into the kitchen, from outside, a cart with two plastic tubs full of shredded beef, not covered. Where this meat came from was anybody's guess. I did not finish my dinner after seeing that and we left. We wont be back.",

If you sound like us, look no further than here! Husband got the chimichanga, I got the enchiladas tray, and baby shared off of our plates. It was not fancy, but exactly what I was looking for. My husband raved about his chimichanga and the baby kept clapping a squealing with delight. I did take off a star because the cashier got my order wrong even after we had a discussion about it (I only wanted the enchiladas, not the upcharge to the tray).   The seating space indoors is also limited, so you'll have to be aggressive about snatching a table or wait until something opens. Maybe it's not worth going out of the way for, but it's definitely worth it if you're nearby!",

The chips were hot and fresh and so crispy . Both of our burritos  were easily the size of an adult forearm . Both were stuffed full of tender and perfectly seasoned meat.

Same Family owned joint on the corner of McClintock and Chandler Blvd that's been serving Chandler before any of you started shopping at the mall around the corner. Leon has poured his life, heart and soul to continue to give the best to everyone that steps into Espo's. I will forever continue to support him the restaurant and community of Pueblo Alto (aka Hightown) for as long as he keeps those doors open. It's amazing seen how far its come since its little beginnings. This place is another True staple to Chandler's history. If you haven't dropped by to grab a bite you need to stop whatever you are doing and go right now! Oh, and they do get super busy around lunch and dinner. Stop by for Taco Tuesday and be on the lookout for special events like Cinco De Mayo. I promise you won't be disappointed. Go get you some!",

The queso was the best we have ever had with the right amount of spice.  We have been to the restaurant a few times for lunch. It is usually busy especially on taco tuesday, prepare to wait a little bit in line and to find a seat. You can sit outside but with the AZ heat many people sit inside where there is only about 7 tables. The tacos are good but spicy with their pico de gallo, so I usually get it on the side. The tortillas usually fall apart which is a disappointing mess and thats with meat and pico only so not much weight inside. Many people get burritos which look awesome so that might have to be the go to from now on.",

The cashier is pretty much always checked out, but in person they pay more attention and your order is more likely to be correct the first time.

    "text": "Ive read many reviews raving about their green Chile, and I've been dying to try it!!!  After debating where to get some lunch, I talked my wife into making the 25 mile trip to Chandler to try Espos. Once getting there I was shocked how small the parking is, it literally hold like 5 cars. We parked across the street and made our way in.   From the outside I didn't really know what to expect but once we walked in we were pleasantly surprised. It was very nicely cleaned and decorated. There isn't a ton of seating in there so I can see how it would get super busy and crowded in there. I wanted to try everything!!! I stuck to the the Green Chile and got the Chapo Burrito with beans and rice. My wife got the 3 tacos, and we got chips and salsa. They asked if it was our first time there and when we told them yes they gave us 2 free drinks. When we got our chow I was in heaven! The green Chile was delicious and has a small kick to it. It all bended together so well that I was in my own little world with El Chapo! The Beans and rice were a bit bland, I was happy that they weren't using uncle bens rice which is what most \"Mexican restaurants\" do. Adding salsa on it gave it some flavor. My wife's 3 tacos honestly were just ok, and im glad I didn't order that. I told her the reviews say \"stick to green chile\". I let her try my burrito and she loved it to. We even ordered another for dinner. If im ever in the area around lunch time ill def. come back to this spot. Friend service, great chow!!",

    "text": "I decided to come here after hearing about their Taco Tuesday special with little to no expectations. I really just wanted $1 tacos - which are only $1 if you get the 10 taco deal, and It's $1.50 if you don't. They also have a 3 tacos plus a drink for $5.00. I think the best deal in the house is their margaritas ($2) and beer buckets (5 bottles for $10).   Parking was pretty packed when I arrived (not the smallest of parking lot either) with 2 open lots. Entering through the gates, I can see why this place brings in a crowd on Tuesday. On the patio, they play lively Latin music as everyone enjoys their drinks and food. The line was not too long - the friendly staff works fast to get orders in, but getting orders out took maybe 20 minutes (not a bad time considering how packed it was). Getting a table was hard as well. You have to be ready to pounce on a table once it clears.  The food. If I wrote this review alone on just the food, and not considering the price, it would probably be only 2/5 stars. I had the mango peach fruit drink (pretty good, a little too watered down), 4 grilled chicken, 4 carne asada, and 2 carnitas. The tortillas are okay, nothing special. I personally like that they were not too soggy and didn't break so easy. I thought the chicken was going to be just GRILLED, but the final product was shredded chicken soaked in a broth. Carne asada seemed like it didn't get a good sear, and it possibly was rushed too quick or soaked in juice too long. Carnitas were the best, but I mean it's carnitas... always good - this one had nothing special to it. Lots of salsa and toppings to choose from; all were about medium spice. The lighter green sauce had more tomatillos sour to it, lighter red sauce has a stronger tomato base, dark red sauce is thicker with spices, and dark green sauce had a stronger hint of maybe oregano or cumin (was my favorite, especially on the chicken).",

Unfortunately I'm not sure what all the hype is about, the food fell short of anything I would want to have again. I ordered the egg, bacon, pico breakfast burrito and found it to be too salty and my mistaking of just pico with pico de gallo made it not as flavorful as I was hoping. The bean and cheese burrito was very disappointing, it just didn't taste right, I actually stopped after 3 bites. I ordered to go but I thought the workers were friendly enough and the place seemed alright for dining in, they got my food ready fairly quick. I might give them another try but otherwise I'll stick to my usual Amado's next time.",

    "text": "My spouse and a friend went to Espo's for the first time. We have lived in the area for years and have not taken the time to visit. We have been missing out! The outside patio is inviting while inside, the line is continuous with many regular customers. I had two tacos, one shredded chicken and one shredded beef. They came with fluffy flour and corn tortillas respectively. The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the salsa was a wonderful blend of spices. It packed some heat. The beef was also juicy and flavorful and the pico on top had diced jalepenos, which added substantial heat. I would ask for no pico next time. The meat on both could have been drained a little better. Spouse had an egg and chorizo burrito - all day breakfast FTW- and said it was a nice blend of proteins and spicy goodness. We are sad that we just now visited this gem and will definitely return!",

After we were done eating Julie came out and checked on us to make sure everything was okay and told us about their specials.

Today we drove by here on our way to Cheesecake Factory and decided to make a 'u'y. Today is the day to try this place! The portions were very large and price seemed to be of good value. I had guacamole added to my chicken a la carte tostada and they piled it on. It tasted homemade and was good. As far as what my bf ordered, he said it was average, though again, large portions. The hot sauce was a little hot for my liking, but I'm somewhat of a hot sauce whimp!!  I would probably come back to try one of the salads. It was a fun relaxed environment and provided outside seating. Nothing fancy. The staff was friendly and I liked the antique decor. They do not have a wait staff...it is order and pick up.",

My tacos were stuffed with steak and pico, each bite was flavor town. Rice and beans were okay I could have done without.  Each state makes beans and rice differently so I wont hold it against them.  Wifes burrito was also good super tasty pork with green chili's.",

My daughter ordered a tostada and it was huge! The taco bar full of salsas had a great selection and they were ALL delicious. I was worried about a packed house and that the food would take long, but they were speedy and had great, friendly service! :) We shared a table with a nice man from North Carolina.

I don't remember the previous price but the new price is $8.15. The menu is now on the wall and there were no handheld menus.

It's a good sign when you see older Mexican ladies cooking in the back and patrons of Hispanic descent (ooh, that was really, really p.c.) at tables all around you.  The portions are sizable and the food tastes authentic.  The tortillas are excellent, large, thin, soft, warm.  Only tortillas that compare are Carolina's.  There were a couple food items that looked a bit different, maybe strange, but they were delicious.  The carne asada was like nothing I'd seen.  It looks like ground beef or some kind of soilant-green meat product,...sorry, sounds gross,....but it was really good and tasty.  I had low hopes for the guacamole when it came out and looked very smooth and maybe from a package.  But, I was wrong, it was excellent!  Beans looked a bit runny, but very flavorful and delicious!  Rice, excellent!!  Chicken asada, very soft and flavorful. The pico was super fresh and chilled,....salsa was fantastic and spicy.  Overall, I thought this was one of the best tasting Mexican Restaurants I have been to in quite a while and I already look forward to returning.  I'd definitely recommend it for out-of-towners looking for authentic Mexican cuisine, family fun, relaxing dinners or a night out with friends.",

The first time I went, I had a carne asada taco that while flavorful fell apart because it did not have a very substantial tortilla.  And what they call flautas are what everybody else calls taquitos-nothing special here.  On the second occasion, I went for Taco Tuesday.  Upon entering, there were two people ahead of me and I noticed that all the employees were eating lunch.  Not one person bothered to get up and take the orders. We had to wait  a good 5 minutes until the girl was done playing with her cell phone to order.  I ordered a ground beef taco and when it arrived, I saw that they didnt even put lettuce or tomato in it.  It was simply ground beef in a tortilla-that's it.  There was a salsa bar but I was not too impressed with the flavors of the salsas.  My other tacos were alright-nothing amazing.  On the third occasion, I ordered a beef machaca chimichanga.  While it came with sour cream and cheese, they didn't even bother to melt the cheese on the chimichanga.  I honestly have had better chimichangas at Garcia's-which pains me to say.  Oh, I also had big chunks of gristle in the meat. Yuck. Yuck . Yuck !  A shining gem?  Give me a break.",

I've pretty much eaten all the different items on the menu. I don't think they got their beer license back yet or I missed that on the menu. Don't let the look of the restaurant fool you. The food is better then fancy Mexican food places. The portions are really huge so it's easy to over order. I usually split something and add a cheese crisp or something with my fiance. The employees are always beyond friendly too. Restroom is out back in a separate building. Kind of weird but it looks clean so don't freak out.  Enjoy.",

It's a small cozy eatery that offers both indoor and outdoor seating. I personally would recommend taking it to-go if you live in the area. Parking can be a little hectic but it just goes to show how big of a following they have.  Six words:  Machaca Enchiladas and Green Chile Plate. Their rice is super fluffy and tasty and the beans are done right. Toss on more cheese and their spicy green salsa and it's a meal that'll stick to your bones. Their red salsa is also done beautifully but the green salsa packs the heat. They make some wonderful plates that taste amazing. I still need to try their burritos but this is the place I go to for enchiladas.  So come to Espos for some good eats. Don't dilly dally and get your butt over there right now!",

It had a nice kick to it and wasn't overly oily with steak that was tender. The chips and Queso is normal usually for any Mexican restaurant but the Queso itself had a multitude of ingredients that made it have a great texture as well. Overall, if you're looking for something tasty, fast, and priced well try out Espos.",

If you come and are greeted with a line out the door for this food and these people you better believe it's worth it and well deserved. Listen here buddy. You're not going to find tacos this good and an environment this beautiful anywhere else. Here's the deal. On Tuesdays you can get 5 beers and 10 tacos for 20 bucks. Where are you going to find that? And where are you going to find this quality of food? These folks deliver, I tell ya. Get there today and make a friend because seating is somewhat scarce but in the good way. Only the friendliest of people come here so you need to get here now and become a friend. Gosh darn THIS IS THE SPOT",

Some confusion however - there were conflicting flyers around the property about the price, one sign said that Tuesday street tacos were $1.50 ea, another sign said that you get 3 tacos and a soda for $5. I don't really like to drink soda, but the girl at the counter was getting impatient that we were asking and she insisted there was only one deal they offered. Not even a big deal, we had the carnitas and carne asada tacos - and hell-yah! the salsa bar is very, very cool.  Must have been 5 or 6 different sauces, pickled onions, roasted serrano peppers, lime wedges, cilantro, chopped onions.... there was more but I forgot to snap a pic. One more important mention: the house salsa provided with the tacos was not to be found on the salsa bar....but it was soooo good, you not belief!!! As far as I could tell, there was lots of oregano in it, but not in an Italian way! Super-tasty, Ima return sooon with $10 and gets me a TACO PAR-TAY! Um, fiesta, por favor. The outdoor patio seating was perfect at this time of year :)",

    "text": "Having lived in Mexico City and Santa Fe NM, two incredible culinary capitals of the world, I found myself in Chandler AZ on business and looked for a non-chain good place to do a quick dinner.    Enter Espo's in Chandler.  I was told that it had recently been remodeled but it looks and feels like it's been like this since the 50's - Spartan, cement floors, standard tables and chairs.  Exactly how it should be.  The staff are 4 Latin women speaking Spanish and very friendly and happy.  No attitude.    Food - I ordered the green chile beef burrito and the beef floutas.   Unlike Same in either Mexico City or Santa Fe.   The burrito was excellent - soft tortilla wrapping a mushy mix of refried beans, shredded beef and subtle hints of green chile - simple but really effective (a+).  The floutas - over cooked hard shells, not enough inside and a little bland -rescued by surrounding lettuce, tomato, cheese and added red hot sauce (b-).  Add a dos Equis with a lime, with tip was 15 bucks.    Quick service, overall A- food and appropriate surroundings and I highly recommend a stop in.  Set expectations correctly - this is not American Mexican - nor is it traditional Mexican cuisine (mole, al pastor, etc), nor is it high end regional cuisine (green chile from Romero farms NM on grilled elk).  It is basic SW USA Mexican, low cost but very good at what they do.  Enjoy!",

Ordered carne assada tacos plain and a carne assada chimi.  The carne assada (in the tacos and chimi) has the texture of a meat product but not much flavor.  So the tacos weren't bad but they were bland (even plain tacos should have some sort of flavor).  As for the chimi since it came with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, cheese and guacamole, it tasted like those things.  Overall, a pretty big meh.  That being said, I'll probably go back if for no other reason than old times sake.    I gave them a 3 (agian, old times sake) but in reality it's closer to a 2.",

Lots of menu options with variations of the assorted meats like carne asada, carnitas, etc. My husband and I got the El Jefe burrito filled with steak, lots of cheese and green chiles. Very tasty! My daughter got the taco salad served in a ginormous fried flour tortillas bowl. Wow! She's a big eater and she couldn't finish it! Chips and salsa were only 2.75 for a literal bucket of house made chips! Delicious and reasonably priced (burrito was 5.95 and taco salad was 6.29). Very good, I would definitely come back.\"",

In under an hour, they got us 25 tacos, enough quesadillas for a staff of ten as well as churros for all! Thank you so much for the delicious food and wonderful customer service. You definitely have return customers. Thank you for saving the day!",

    "text": "I'd come back here, time and again, just for the crispy taco plate!  To me, tacos to Mexican food are like chips to a sammie: you might get a taco on a combo plate, but the reason you ordered the meal was for something bigger and better. The taco? It's just a little more than a condiment. That said, I have no idea what drove me to order the 3-tacos (ground beef) w/ rice and beans on the side, but I think I was hoping for an unlikely gastric event -- a really tasty taco.  I won!!!  Crispy tortilla that was consistent throughout, and the remaining shell held its molded structure and didn't shatter like broken glass when you took a bite. I like that. I also appreciated that the taco was filled w/ meat, more so than lettuce, cheese and tomato. I like my taco old school, and the ground beef was flavorful and not dry.  The aforementioned dressings were chilled and fresh. Crispy, tasty goodness. I should have ordered 3 more!  The rest of the meal? Not too shabby. I liked the refried beans, but the rice was really salty. Also, my buddy grabbed the salsa (well, it was more of what I would call a \"red sauce\"), so I don't know if there were multiple options, but I prefer a chunky salsa over a sauce. Still, it had a good flavor and was not overpowering as a condiment. Guacamole was okay, and the portion of the side order was plentiful. Regrettably, I found the chips to be a tad over done, and too thick for my liking (I enjoy a lighter chip, cooked in fresh oil).  All in all, a really good meal, complimented by friendly service. I'll be back for the tacos . . .   Cheers! RL",

    "text": "It was a cold, wintery Friday night in the kingdom of Phoenix and I had pledged my allegiance to transport the fair maiden from her castle in downtown to the birthday banquet of her dear friend. It would be a grand feast, a feast large enough to rival the most important of dignitaries, it was not to be missed.   Travelling far, far away, to the foreign land of Chandler, I left the warmth of my hovel, with the young boy in tow and the fair maiden as our passenger. The 145 horse Toyota carriage made quick time of our travels as we escorted our passenger to her banquet. With two and a half rotations of the hour glass until her meal concluded, the boy and I were off to find a meal fit for a king.  I always travel with Lord Yelp's scroll of merriment and wonder, I wouldn't find myself beheaded without it. In truth, Lord Yelp's scroll of merriment and wonder is the quintessential catalogue for booths, stalls and eateries in every land, and on this night, it directed us to Espos, the most wondrous of food from the southern land of Mexico.  I am simply unable to agree more with the sentiment of Lord Yelp with regards to the Espos carnitas plate, simply put, it is the stuff in which the night's dreams are made of and the rice and beans were delectable as well. Should I find myself travelling in the land of Chandler in days ahead, I would not be opposed to again trading my coin for meal.",

Never was I told I'm sorry about this nor did a manager even bother to come talk to me. The staff in the kitchen just laughs. I ask if my meal will be comped. The staff goes back to the manager Evan to ask if my dinner can be taken off. He says no because I'm still getting the food. This is poor business! It not about the 9.00 for dinner  it's about doing what it's right.",

The food itself was a mixed bag though. The tortillas themselves are good quality. My carne asada was neither good nor bad- just decent. The beans had a nice flavor but were on the runny side. My son wanted to try the flour tortilla chips, but neither of us liked them at all. I think corn tortilla chips are the way to go. The salsa was given a thumbs up by my son though. I think Espo's has the potential to be a place we would enjoy, but we need to try some other menu items first.",

Ice cold chicken.  Hmmm.  Had them remade.  The second batch was hot, but tasted like cardboard.   The enchilada plate sauce was delicious, but the cheese enchiladas themselves...well, after a couple bites that exposed the center of the enchilada, it was just a hunk of unmelted shredded cheese out of a bag.  Unmelted.  Just a lump of shredded cheese.  I could have done a better job of melting shredded cheese at home.   Moving on, the refrieds would have been tastier if they had come out of a smaller can.  Seriously they were just flavorless brown mush.    The chips with melted cheese were fine, but greasy.  The salsa was spicy.    I can think of 100 other Mexican restaurants I'd rather patronize in the valley.   But hey, I was able to get a beer and sit on a neat patio.   And I certainly had good company.",

When I spoke to the girl at the counter about all of the flies she simply smiled and turned on the fan. Then when we went to sit down there were 10 or more baby flies on the table!! For the 30 minutes  we were there, I was swatting away flies.  It is clear they have a fly infestation.. I asked a gentleman who worked there if they could do something and he suggested we sit outside.. my big question is what are we doing to address the issue? I'm concerned with all the flies around the food.    There were numerous Fly larva on the floor  Please tell me you are  contacting an exterminator..

They have a vegan burrito that is outstanding. The chips and salsa are super tasty. But the bomb was something they call \"green sauce\". It's served warm and I ended up using it to dip my chips in and poor on my burrito.  It's a must visit place when in the Phoenix/Chandler/Tempe area.",

Tired of looking for good Mexican food in a place that should offer it on every corner, we often don't bother anymore. Espo's, as you will read in their Yelp write-up, existed for 40 years in this same location until some time back and then was reborn this last year. We found it a few months after its re-opening and it was packed with a variety of folks, many of whom had apparently just found it as we had. Yesterday we were there again and noticed how many of the patrons were of Mexican descent--a very good sign. The food is the best you'll find for 20 miles in any direction and very reasonably priced. I tend to stick with what I like, so I can only directly speak for the tacos and the chimis. Staff is super-friendly, vibe is warm and cheerful and decor is simple old-world rustic. And they now have beer! Great outdoor patio seating.",

It was taco Tuesday and my husband and i saw an ad on the internet for 10 street tacos for 10$ and we thought it sounds like a great deal so we decided to go! We got 10 chicken tacos and although the tortillas are small they really pack on the meat it was so good. They also have a salsa bar and they were all very good and spicy! It was very busy and I can see why it's delicious! 10/10 would suggest this to anyone but just letting you know it is pretty hot inside even with several fans but there is an outside area with fans and misters so if you sit in shade it's actually pretty nice. Hope to go back soon",

Seriously, I cannot remember a time when they did not make a mistake and either leave something out or mix things up. Their mistakes with orders are so consistent that now I have extremely low expectations and order from them only sporadically and then get angry at myself for not checking the order before I leave because inevitably they mess something up that I realize once I get home and open the containers. The food is OK but the consistency in mismanaging orders makes me order from them way less than if they got things right.",

Two burros broke open upon first grab, after waiting 20 minutes for our order. Granted it was a Sunday at around 1pm and busy, had to wait to ask for extra tortillas to double wrap tortillas and by time done fixing the busted open burros my burro was cold, and then broke open as well.

Price per person: average $10  Meals:  served with Refried beans and rice and topped with light lettuce and tomatoes Service: order at cashier Food quality:  score 4 out of 5 as the ground beef was very greasy and the tortillas shells cooked were mushy and burned on the bottom.  I was given a replacement meal for the burnt bottom.  A few things to consider:  - The rice has tomatoes and onions for those who are subject to fussy. - ground beef is relatively greasy \"but\" flavored well. - Red salsa is basically HOT sauce and I was not able to eat any of it. - Green chili (sauce for meals choice) was mild to most but still spicy for me, you can ask for light or on the side. - Excellent $2 margaritas. - if you want extra containers to take stuff home there may be a charge. - bathrooms are outside and unisex. - probably can't go wrong with taco Tuesdays.  Over all I think it's a good \"find\" and has something to please everyone, even me who can do spicy.",

Pluses : convenient and pleasant tasting. No stomach upset afterwards.  Minuses: location not ideal, very busy intersection. Lot of traffic a few feet from the patio. Very casual atmosphere. Nothing upscale here. All food served on  foil pans or disposable plates, not a fan of that for eating in.",

First of all, you get 10 street tacos for $10!  Seriously?? Yes! What a bargain!   If you like fantastic tasting tacos, beer, freshly made punch that you can ask to have it spiked with a shot of tequila or rum, a salsa bar and music, then you must stop by Espos on Tuesday! Be prepared to wait a bit in a crowded friendly place, but you won't be sorry! My favorite Mexican restaurant in The Valley!",

The taco salad had iceberg lettuce, seasoned ground beef, olives, tomatoes, sour cream (a healthy spoon full) and shredded cheese. It was served in a flour tortilla bowl. The bowl was the star of the show. It was flaky and fried to perfection. I opted out of ordering a drink (soda, hortchata, Mexican Coke, or Agua Fresca). I appreciated the help-yourself iced lemon water.   The cons: I was disappointed I had to wait 20 minutes for my lunch order. There were two options for salsa, red or green. I wish a spicy salsa was available.   I plan on returning for Taco Tuesday. On Tuesday street tacos are $1.50. Or 10 tacos for $10, I'll have to convince my coworkers to join me!",

    "text": "Happy national burrito day! Here's to El Jefe - one of my new favorite burritos in AZ. Holy cow, this thing is good. A very hefty burrito stuffed with 75% carne asada and 25% other toppings (pico, cheese, green sauce), this thing is great value for money. Their carne asada is some of the best I've had, with a good mix of meat and fat that's been cooked and seasoned really well. One of these things could probably last me 2 meals but being the glutton I am, I inhaled the whole thing (and had a small amount of regret by mid-afternoon).  I've been here for taco Tuesday and didn't really think it was anything worthwhile. I'm glad I came back for that burrito though, because that thing will be my go-to for a long time. I'm loving their buckets of chips as well, especially the flour ones.  They used to have a salsa bar, but it looks like they got rid of it. I appreciate it, as the old salsa bar had so many things to choose from and took up a pretty big chunk of space. I'm also a simplistic guy, so a naked burrito (or with a splash of salsa) is enough for me. They now have 2 baskets with the basic red and green salsas. The green salsa was spicier than the red in my opinion, and had better flavor as well.  The outside patio is great for nice weather, and the staff is mostly friendly. Food comes out pretty quickly even when they're busy inside. Everybody always looks happy with their food, so they must be doing something right!",

It is seriously the best, the flavor, the rice, so good!   Last time I came here, they messed up my order (i called to pick it up) and made me wait for an hour, they were busy at the time. I mean, it is unacceptable for a pickup order to wait THAT long, but I gave them another chance.  So here I am, months later, ordered the same like I always got, on a Tuesday night, it was even busier than last time. I was thinking to just ditch my order if they would make me WAIT for another hour, but nope, not this time around. I was so happy and decide to keep coming back!",

That may not mean much considering the place is so small, but regardless, there were a lot of people there! You order your food first and then sit down. We had a little bit of work to find a table because the entire restaurant was full. There was plenty of seating outside, but it was a little chilly that night.   We ordered an asada burrito and an asada chimichanga, along with some chips and salsa. The food was delicious. The burrito was nicely wrapped and very tasty. The chimichanga had a perfectly crispy exterior that I love. The interior was good, but if I could offer some feedback, I would add a little bit of cheese or sauce or something to bind everything together. When you cut it open, the asada would just tumble out like marbles and wouldn't stay together. It took some effort to get a complete bite. The chips are a bit bland and boring, but they were still good complements to our meal.   I would rate this place 4 stars but I can't. Although the food was good, the restaurant was not great. The dining area smelled like mildew everywhere you went. Imagine a sweaty gym bag, or mildewy towel or shoe and multiply it by 10. I think it was coming from the trays and the floor. Usually, things like this don't bother me much, but it was so overwhelming, we had to move outside even though it was cold. I think they need to look at their rags, mops, and other cleaning devices.   If you're thinking of trying this place, do it! The food is good. But consider getting it to go. You'll enjoy it so much more.",

The first indicator of a good authentic Mexican food is how the beans and rice taste.  They were delicious..... My red chili enchiladas were awesome and spicy with some bite.  My wife's chimichanga was very good..... We'll be back soon!  I give this place cinco chili's  .  Good place to go and hang out !",

I'm glad I get to share this place with my kids and hopefully it will still be here for theirs!!",

Unfortunately they do not have any veggie options so that was a bummer.  Firstly the sauce on the enchiladas was soooooo good. The entire tortilla was soaked really well in it and it enhanced the flavor of the dish a lot. I wish there were veggies or something more than just cheese and refried beans but except meat there is no other option. But must say, I did enjoy my dinner and would definitely go back whenever I visited Phoenix!",

It was my fist time to Espos and I decided to get my favorites. I ordered a 3 taco plate with 2 ground beef tacos, a carne asada taco and 2 ground beef enchiladas. I love ground beef and it is seasoned just right! it isnt full of extras like potatoes or tomato sauce just simple ground beef and it is amazing! The Carne Asada is grilled just right and also season perfectly. Refried Beans are smooth and full of flavor and paired with fluffy rice round out the plate perfectly. The hot sauce is has just enough spice and compliments the food and adds the perfect amount of heat. Service is great and everyone was friendly and helpful. you know you found a special place when everything tastes like your Grandma was preparing it herself. This is my new spot for amazing Mexican food. 5 all day!!",

Being from the midwest what I know as Mexican isn't exactly the same as what I am finding out here in the desert southwest!   I was surprised to find so many \"chain\" restaurants and not as many authentic Mexican ones as I expected to be out in this area of the country.   Espos is a delightful little place to eat and I must say the food was exceptionally good!  It is nothing fancy, and somewhat small but the cooks know what they are doing when it comes to preparing Mexican cuisine.   I came on a Wed. around 1:30 in afternoon to miss the crowd, since I was alone.  You could tell they had been busy but the place was still well kept.  There are no floor servers, you go up to counter and order off of a huge wall menu then find a table.   They have EVERYHIING!!  I was so happy to find cheese dip! Not easy to find out here but all mex places back in Indiana serve it.  Didn't have to wait too long for my food.  I had the chicken/onion burrito with cheese dip and salsa/chips.   I was only able to eat half of it and took rest home.   The prices are very reasonable and most items are ordered \"a la carte\" style.    I am sure going to return here again in the future.   As the weather is finally cooling down I am looking forward to sitting out on their spacious patio,  perhaps in the evening sometime soon. Monica",

Ordered chicken taco salad, green chili burrito chimi and a machaca chile enchilada style.  One chili came plain and not enchilada style when I took it back the gal that came to take it back seemed annoyed .  minutes later she came and tossed the the tray back over the small counter with horrible look at me.  The tray had cheese all over before I could think of snapping a pic I had gathered it up on my tray.  But here's a pic anyways.  Now the plate looked good but the meat in both was super salty!    Had it not been for the rice and beans and sour cream it would have been unedible.  Portions were a healthy size and rice and beans delicious but the service lousy.   Maybe it was too late in Sunday to visit. Idk but I'll pass next time.",

This place was recommended to me today and we tried them out and its Fantastic!  It may not look like one of these corporate chain restaurants on the outside or inside, but what they serve Taste Really Great with lots of Flavor!  You can dine inside or out on their Patio.  I noticed they recently applied for a Liquor License (sign posted), so I'm not sure if they served now or not.",

Not much heat (which is good in my book) and a large portion for the price ($6.50ish). The chips were a bust and was not a fan of the salsa/hot sauce but that did not even matter to me. More room for my amazing burro! We will definitely be back ..... in fact I plan on taking the family there this weekend for some dinner! Good stuff! Try the Green Chile!",

We live an hour away and really wished they had a location close to us (Anthem - hint, hint).    Do not pass up the flour tortilla chips! They come out warm and are addicting.    I had the carnitas plate which was very good (and spicy!) and my son really enjoyed his taco burro.    Will definitely visit Espo's again when we are back in the area.",

They attempt to be fancy by covering every dish in half-a-can of black olives, which sucks, because olives are horrible and ruin everything they touch. Stop doing that, Espo's, and you'll stop wasting food and I might come back. Olives or any food that pungent are not a garnish. Refried beans are great and the rice is pretty good. Chicken chimi wasn't bad (but kinda hard to fuck up a deep fried burrito), just the filling was extremely salty (so I guess they did kinda fuck it up). Would maybe try again, but nothing special calling me back. Especially with those olives all over everything, gross.",

Nevertheless I tried to eat the burrito and it was pretty greasy.  I know Mexican food is supposed to be like that, but I didn't want to gain ten pounds by just looking at the burrito.

The outside patio looked fun, had a DJ playing music.  Going back tomorrow night early to see if it's better. Going to sit on Patio this time!!!",

The food is always amazing and has that homemade feel that makes you feel all warm inside. It is a bit expensive compared to comparable Mexican restaurants in the area but you get what you pay for. Healthy portions and fresh ingredients will keep you coming back.   Also, they have red cream soda tap, which is rare to see and boy is it tasty.  If you have never been, you really are missing out.",

First and foremost, the outside seating area is very comfortable, even though it's right next to Chandler Boulevard.  The inside is very unassuming and kind of what I thought it would be looking at it from the outside.  The ONLY challenge I've had with this awesome place is sometimes the tables are rather sticky. Other than that the place is immaculate.  My wife is a fan of the chicken enchiladas, and so far, I've tried everything \"chime style\"...chicken, chili (red & green) and Carne Asada (my favorite so far).  This is one of those go up to the counter and order kind of places, and if you time it just right you'll miss the crowds...and it does get crowded seemingly out of nowhere.  The service is fast, the pricing is very reasonable and the staff are all very friendly.  Salsa (red) is decent but maybe a little too much oregano for my taste, but the green salsa is really good!  Taco Tuesday has the best hand made tortillas as well.  I highly recommend this place and once you eat there, you will too!",

The food takes a while to be prepared. I believe I waited almost 15-20 mins for my food. I ordered the food to go but that made no difference in the wait time. They prepare the food on a first come first serve basis.  The horchata was delicious. My only complaint was the beans. They lacked flavor and taste.  I was also surprised about the prices as they were on the expensive side for Mexican food.  Mexican food seems to be cheaper in Chicago than here.",

We had the el jefe burrito enchilada style and the carne asada enchilada style. The meat was seasoned PERFECTLY topped with a tasty and a little spicy green sauce and cheese. The red sauce was also delicious. The whole meal was HUGE and soo satisfying. Another note is that the staff is SUPER SUPER clean and conscientious about being sanitary. A super duper plus for this neat freak germaphobe. Like I said try this place you will love it!",

The customer service was not good. The girl behind the counter was on the phone, hung up, and didn't acknowledge me for about 2 minutes while she input a phone order. When my meal came out she must have whispered my order number because my food was just sitting there, waiting for me. It was clean inside.  Bottom line: There are better Mexican food options within a five mile radius. Rositas's, Burrito Express, Elmers, Amado's, Cafe Rio, etc. Go a little further and try Los Taquitos or Burrito Company. I won't be back to Espo's.",

All I could think was how much business would have been brought in by the new hotel across the street. Well now it will!  Same menu as before but laid out very nicely in the front of the restaurant. Same type of ordering process, order at the front, they call your number when your order is ready. It looks like they no longer have a liquor license which is no big deal to me and I don't think it will be detrimental to the business, the food speaks for itself.  I had two machaca beef tacos which were delicious. Espo's does machaca beef so well. The green chile beef is a staple here and great in both burrito form as well as chimichanga if you are being adventurous. Service was great.  I'm so glad Espo's is back. Reasonably priced Mexican food that is done so well. You can't beat it!",

I love pickled Jalapenos and carrots, but they do not have any.  I ordered two chicken tacos.  I got two ground beef tacos.  Pros:  Even though they gave me the wrong tacos, the ground beef had a great flavor!  The amount of meat in it was pretty hefty as well!  Really, really good tacos!  I got the El Jefe burrito as well.  Not your traditional carne asada.  This is with cheese and green chiles.  Kinda heavy, but fantastic flavor!   Absolutely worth a return trip!!  I got my son a couple bean and cheese burritos, and he loved them.  All in all, I'm very happy with Espos.  This isn't a cookie cutter, bland chain store.  This is the real deal!!",

I would think it would be easy but sadly this place wasn't that good. I had a basic crispy chicken taco and my husband had a carne asada taco. We shared some rice, beans and chips and salsa too. The meat was bland in the carne asada, no seasoning at all. The chicken wasn't grilled like it says on the menu and the crispy taco was so soggy from the chicken juices it all fell apart. The rice and chicken was super salty and I am usually the person who salts stuff and this was way to salty for even me. The salsa was bland and no flavor a other than a red chili taste. I would skip this place if you are looking for good Mexican food, this isn't worth the energy.",

As I started hearing order numbers called off I took another look at my receipt to make sure I wasn't going crazy, sure enough my number had not yet been called & the new numbers were steady getting larger & larger (than mine). The young lady behind the counter said nothing to me until I stood back on line to cancel-she must have sensed my agida when she said 'Isra, I see her wrapping your order now - she had to re-make it'  I grabbed my order & when I arrived home was really annoyed to find that my enchiladas were flat & food was not secured in its packaging. The top was loose & had shifted into my food! I'll have to see how I feel about visiting again because my tolerance for poor customer service is really low. The food is good but not worth this kind of hassle - I waited about an extra 10 minutes after I called ahead. What sealed it for me was the hostess lack of attention until I stood up to get ready to leave - she totally could have said across the countertop, 'hey they had to re-do' or any number of things... we'll see what happens going forward.",

There was DJ on the patio, the parking lot was overflowing, and the line was loooong.  Don't drop by for a quick bite on Tuesdays.  If you do come by though you'll find great taco, beer, and margarita specials.  $10 for 10 tacos that are overflowing with meat was a tremendous deal.  I grabbed 10 to go and a Negro Modelo for the wait.  Suddenly I'm looking forward to next Tuesday.",

The green chile in the Relleno was roasted perfectly and the outer masa was crisp that satisfied at the first and last bite. The spicy heat was appropriate to not over power the combined flavors. I'm very pleased to see this place has resurrected. I had such fond memories from high school, because they left a void that couldn't be filled.",

When I asked to speak to the manager, the girl behind the counter responded that no one was there, and no one could help.   It is really frustrating when you place an order ahead, and not only to be forgotten about, but completely neglected. When we got the food, it was overcooked and tasted horrible. It was clear they rushed, since they likely forgot about us. (The girl told me three times the food was being wrapped up.) I will be reaching out to the owners for a full refund. IMO you can get a better breakfast burrito at Adablertos. BEWARE!",

We took the leftovers home thinking maybe the flavors would intermingle and be more evident the next day......nope still bland and lacking taste. I know I know, some of you are probably saying \"oh well you're probably a smoker and your taste buds are shot.\" Nope, have never smoked a day in my life.     Cute atmosphere and pleasant staff but this was our 1st and last trip, food tasted literally like nothing. But they must be making some people happy as the line was out the door.

Craig: I would eat about 25% of that stuff again. I think we both left about half our meals on the plates.   Me: Agreed. The chicken enchiladas with green sauce were decent, maybe 3.5 or 4 stars for me.   Craig: The green chile was probably a four star. But the surroundings...  Me: Yeah, the beans and rice were really bland, especially the rice. The chips were okay, but that red salsa was so bitter I couldn't eat it.   Craig: The salsa was weeeeeak.   Me: Plus, when I order food to stay, I'd like a real plate and forks that don't melt at the tips. Another reviewer said it was like sit-down dining with Filiberto's prices. But it was more like Filiberto's 2.0.   Craig: It was a little pricier than Filiberto's, so my recommendation is go to Filiberto's.   Me: Yeah, it was okay food in a decent setting, but I can't give it more than 3 stars. I don't think I'd come back since there are Mexican restaurants that are four or five stars for me.  Craig: Yeah.   Me: Craig, you need to come up with things beyond \"Yeah.\"  Craig: *laughing*   Me: They did have a cute patio, but they had a DJ out there, and I don't love loud music while I eat. So this is a pass for me.   Craig: Yeah ;)  Mandy: We didn't take any pictures this time...  Craig: They would have been sad pictures.   Me: Yeah *sigh*",

We were excited because the reviews were great and had high hopes.   My girls had a quesadilla and chips with melted cheese and salsa. I specifically asked the guy if the salsa was on the side because and he said yes. The quesadilla was huge but I was disappointed that my other daughters \"chips and cheese\" had jalapenos all over it. She's four and will not eat that so we picked it all off instead of sending it back as the line was still out the door.  Two of us ordered the taco salad with ground beef and it was just ok. Wish we ordered sour cream and guacamole because it really had no taste. My husband ordered the chicken enchiladas, 2 ways. Both green and red sauce was good. I munched off his plates.   With the order comes a huge bucket of chips but I wish they gave it to you when you order and sit to wait for your food. We did not touch any of it and felt bad for wasting a whole bucket of chips.   We tried ordering the fried ice cream but they said they didn't have it and they needed to take it off the menu. Not sure if they no longer will be serving or just out for the night? We ordered the churros for a sweet treat after we were done and it was the best part of my meal.   Tons of Mexican restaurants around so I can't say we'll be back.",

I don't think it even comes with cheese! It is so good. Brad has ordered other things and really likes their tacos. The tacos are loaded with cilantro, which to me tastes like soap, but he likes those tacos. Tables can be hard to find on the weekend and in the evenings.

    "text": "We were visiting Phoenix from OKC for a business trip and were craving Mexican food so I found this place on Yelp and saw that it was nearby and had decent reviews.  It's got a decently sized outdoor seating area and a smaller indoor seating area. The inside was a bit disorganized- there was no formal \"order place\" it seemed, since nobody was standing at the cash register. A woman kept running back and forth, setting orders on trays and calling out numbers. People would come and grab their trays, meanwhile a few customers had gathered in the same area and were confused as to where we should stand to indicate we wanted to order.  There was only one large menu on the wall, no handheld menus to read, so that was a bit difficult without my glasses.  Either way, we did get to order and took a seat at a table to wait for our number to be called. At first it seemed a tad pricy, but we hadn't seen the food yet. We sipped on our aguas frescas while we waited. They were delicious! They had watermelon and peach. Both were amazingly good. One free refill allowed for those.  We got our food in no more than 10 minutes. My chimichanga was HUGE so I was glad I didn't add rice and beans. There wasn't a ton of flavor but it worked for me because it was perfectly crispy and had plenty of sour cream, shredded cheese, lettuce, and tomato. Some kind of special sauce on top would've been nice, though.  The burritos were rather large, too. My friend said the steak inside was pretty good and they are not skimpy at all with the meats, so it was definitely a good value. The rice and beans were also very good and clearly homemade.  We would totally be back if we come to the area! Hopefully the ordering and front counter area gets a bit more organized, though.",

The prices are cheap, the food is tasty but it's just the standard fast food Mexican that's squarely a 3 star deal.   We had: The Machaca chili plate with spicy green chili sauce on the side. The green chili sauce was HUGE and flavorful and very spicy. Probably the best thing that came out. The refried beans were tasty and salty and had a good amount of cheese.   Machaca tacos were fat and full of meat, cheese and veggies. Very tasty. Hard crispy shell!  Carne asada and Carnitas tacos were a bit smaller than the Machaca and were served on soft corn tortillas. Less veggies (salsa Fresca style).   The burritos were big and full of ingredients.   Chips and salsa were fresh. Salsa had a nice kick but the serving size was tiny! The guacamole was really plain, I'm pretty sure it wasn't real avocado.   We ordered 5 flautas but only got 3 and my Machaca taco was missing until I asked for it.   The bathroom was clean and the outside has a nice patio to sit at.  In summary, it's a solid 3-3.5 star experience. It's fast food homestyle Mexican. Nothing great, nothing bad. But don't take anyone here on a date or for a family reunion!!   I didn't take pictures bc there really wasn't anything photo worthy to show.",

    "text": "Lunch on taco Tuesday, with a couple of friends. Tried 4 different types of tacos. Now these are street tacos, small tortillas, but they are very generous with the meat portions. You help yourself to the condiments. Everyone was very pleased with their choices. My favorite was the carne asada. Salsas were tasty, chopped cabbage fresh. Iced tea was fresh brewed. Counter service, they call your number. Everyone was friendly. Pleasant patio was full, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. What a great place, can't wait to return.",

    "text": "It's been a hit or a miss here for me. This is one of those places that you go for their specialty only which is their green chili burrito.  This will be a review for my past 3 visits and I can now say I'll stick to Los taquitos down the street. Where everything on the menu is delicious and where I have ZERO issues ever.  First time I came (last summer) I didn't have any problems. Beef tacos were good, food was fast, order was accurate, the establishment was clean and everyone was friendly.  The next time I went \"Catfood chicken salad\" would be the best way to describe it..... I didn't even touch my taco salad because the chicken came out a can and the water wasn't even drained, so the complete bottom of the shell was soggy. Definitely NOT chicken asado even when I asked for it.  Then today, something so simple such as an TO-GO order. My order wasn't made to go and it also set on the counter for a good 8 minutes.Normally I'll wait at a counter for my food but I have an injury that makes standing painful. When I asked for my food to be put in boxes TO GO for my TO GO order. I was told I'm sorry then watched the gentleman go to the back where the grill was and asked the cashier if my order was actually to go and the young lady threw her hands up in the air as if this was such an inconvenience for her to do her job or actively listen the first time.  When I got home my order was wrong, the cheese crisp my son ordered wasn't fully cooked and melted, my other sons taco was broken in a few places in the shell (he used a fork to eat his taco) my flautas were burnt too salty to the point where I had to spit it out (and I love salt), husbands burrito was good from what he said. I will not be coming here.",

    "text": "Espo's has always been one of my favorite spots in Chandler. The exterior is a bit off-putting, but I promise it's well worth the stop. Be prepared to fight for a table inside or to sit on the outside patio as the interior of the restaurant it fairly small. Parking can be a little hectic as the lot is a bit awkward and small.  The service at Espo's is always quick and friendly. You can expect your food to be ready in a matter of minutes. Honestly, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My personal favorites are the tamales, any of the tacos and the enchiladas. The posole is a can't miss when it's available. The portion sizes are great especially when considering the price. Everything is always warm and fresh and absolutely delicious.  Seriously, just go. You won't regret it.",

The seating area is very limited, suggest going early to have someone reserve your table. I watched a family get in a fight with another one over a table.   Their taco Tuesday is pretty awesome. 10 tacos for $10. A bucket of beer bottles (I think 6?) are $10. We ordered 10 tacos, nachos with guacamole, and their cinnamon something chip things (THEY ARE AMAZING BTW) Your tacos will come w just the meat, so make sure you grab the condiments in the tiny little stand inside.   The food was absolutely delicious. Explains why it's hard to find parking, seating, and the crowd. Well, I did go on a Tuesday ..... but nonetheless. OH. MY. GOSH. THIS PLACE IS THEEEEEEE. T.H.E. PLACE!!!!!! If you buy your alcoholic beverage outside, there's NO tax. So buy you drank outside.  Sorry I didn't take pictures, I was too busy stuffing my face. :P",

We had the El Chapo burro and the carnitas burro. The El Chapo was filled with green chile beef, potato and cheese. I loved the green chile and the spicy kick to it which was about maybe 6/10 on the spiciness scale for me. The potatoes were a bit mealy tasting though and I would have liked an extra texture such as the addition of onion or pico de gallo to contrast with all the soft textures of the burro. The carnitas was decent, filled with slow cooked pork. The pork was moist as if it were cooked in a pot rather than roasted or fried like how I've encountered other carnitas in other restaurants.   The shop is pretty small with a few tables inside and a cute patio outside with more tables.   Overall it was a satisfying meal and I'd definitely stop by again to try more off their menu.",

    "text": "Maybe we came on an off day to Espo's?! After driving by so many times and seeing a full parking lot but always on my way to appointments or what not and just too busy to stop. Well, today I was finally in a place to stop and see what Espo's was all about! It was about 6pm and the line to order was already long. I geared up because I was hungry and just knew that this was going to be good! While waiting I noted that the patio was cute and decorated for upcoming Cinco de Mayo. Super festive! What I didn't like is that it's walk up counter service and there were no menus which in my opinion would be great for those waiting in a long line; trying to decipher a board menu can be blinding! My husband actually pulled a menu from Yelp while we waited. I have to admit, I am not one for counter service and wanted to maybe leave but I felt bad to go after asking my husband to turn around to come here. We finally get to the guy who took our order. He was less than enthralled with us. Whatever. I guess that's what you get with counter service. The water is set up in a big decanter by the doorway. Mind you the cups they give you are that of the dental office 'flush and spit' type. You may as well take as many as your hands will carry. Would it kill you to hand out bigger water cups? This is Arizona and it's 'authentic' Mexican food, right? You can tell I'm getting a bad taste in my mouth.. and the food has yet to arrive. We sat on the patio. I noted the beers seemed cheap. About 20 minutes later out over a speaker our number is called. Our order of chicken flautas and cheese enchiladas is ready. My husband collects it and it's in foil tins. So much grease is floating on the enchiladas that are souped in beans. We also got an order of chips with 'queso' and salsa. The chips and 'queso' are simply a few tortilla chips with melted shredded cheese on a paper plate. Bleh. The salsa is in small cups and it wasn't tasty. Our rolled tacos were frozen in the center and we took them back to Mister Un-enthusiastic. Did he care? No. The cheese was not melted inside the enchiladas either but at that point, we gave up. When they called for us to come get the rolled tacos .. again here came the bellowing ,'5 PIECE FLAUTA!' Across that noisy, impersonal speaker. Don't you think an error such as serving us uncooked food would have warranted a small act of kindness or decent customer service like bringing us the rolled tacos ? Guess what ? It's didn't. These were burned crisp and the two that were edible .. tasted like frozen , old , stale, rolled, used to be frozen tortillas. Hard. Pass. I would rather eat at a popular greasy taco shop known here in the valley that has better food than this IF I am going for the American-ized version of 'authentic' Mexican food. I don't even have to keep walking to tie water decanter there with my small dental sized cups! That's a joke, when saying it's 'authentic' , right ? Authentic for who??? So the cute patio.. it's cute. To me, that's all this place has going for it.  So many taco shops in the area ... keep driving and don't believe the hype. But I am only one Yelper that doesn't seem to believe this hype. This is my story and I'm sticking to it. Terrible.",

This place was never a fancy place to eat, but this restaurant near the corner of Chandler Blvd and McClintock has always put out great Sonoran style Mexican food.  The menu is geared towards spicy and hearty beef and other meat items. Burros stuffed with stewed beef and pork and enchiladas topped with fiery red or green chile sauce dominate the menu and should not be missed. Cheese crisps and tamales are also great. They also understand Christmas style.  I had to have my red tamale plate with a taco like usual. Taco Tuesdays are in force with $2 street tacos and $2 beers catering to the ASU college crowd. The red sauce was as hot as ever making this gringo sweat big time, and I loved every minute of it.  Food is served scalding hot making take out much easier than eating in the basic restaurant. Service can get slow, but the food is worth the effort and the burn!",

I really lost my appetite when flies were trying to also enjoy my burrito.  There was a fly zapper on the wall but it wasn't on.",

My physical therapist turned me onto this place (I hurt myself moving three large rolls of carpet onto a roof and through a second story window, but I digress).  I was staying at my family's VRBO in Prescott with my father and drove down to PHX for the Business Center Costco to stock up on supplies.  I decided to hop on over to Chandler to try this place out for dinner.  I am sure there are better places, or maybe not, but how often do you get personal restaurant recommendations from a local 1,200 miles away .  I got:  the Machaca, carne asada and carnitas tacos; the green chili beef chimichanga; and a cheese and Machaca enchiladas.  I have nothing but positives to say about the food.  The cashier was a bit short with me, but I can't blame her.  Being new I was as quick with my order as possible, but that was probably pretty slow and this place was slammed most of the time I was there.  Mostly with to go orders.  I may have to drive 1,200 miles to try this place, again.  It will be so worth it, though.",

My advice put someone up front who will smile and treat your customers better and won't just throw pens and their receipts at them. Who will be a tad nicer; it will only help improve your business.",

Have some respect for anyone working in the restaurant industry, it's not easy dealing with crappy people.

As I mentioned this is a casual place, but they have a nice patio out front and the restaurant is actually super clean.  In-fact, it has the nicest bathroom of any casual eatery I have every been to.  On a side note, last time I visited Espos, I noticed they have applied for a liquor license; Yea, Margarita's!

In cooler months, the patio would be a good choice.  Julie was very friendly and helpful. As soon as I said it was my first visit, she offered samples. That helped me decide between Green Chile and Machaca Beef. Both tasted great, but I gave the nod to the Machaca. The beef was tender and oh so flavorful! I was also undecided between a standard burrito or enchilada style, and the staff recommended that I get it plain.  My order came quickly. The tortilla was fresh and tender, and the burrito was incredible! Very moist and well spiced. Next time I'll try the Green Chile, maybe enchilada style.  Highly recommended!",

The burro, wrapped in a thin fresh tortilla, was huge, wonderfully spicy, and full of tender meat.  It was so good, I immediately started to go back the the counter for another.  Then, it hit me that I was stuffed and the second burro must wait.  It won't be kept waiting long.    The well earned 5 star rating is based on the excellent food bringing a smile to my face and the awakening of old happy memories of Mexican cafes of years ago.  Other people can rate the small crowded eating area, counter service, and paper plates.  While they rate, I'm going back for seconds.",
