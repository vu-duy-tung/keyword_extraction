    "text": "I tend to be a bit of a snob when it comes to sushi. Rarely have I been blown away by the sushi restaurant. I find typically that the sushi is ok but nothing special.   However, this was not the case at Shimogamo. Everything was quite fresh so much so that they were out of several of the items we wanted. We tried several of their specialty items and were quite impressed with each. I highly recommend the miso marinated salmon and the tsunami roll were amazing.   I ordered two items that are almost staples in my sushi: caterpillar roll and unagi. The unagi was so fresh and fabulous. I did not add my normal extra eel sauce because of the incredible taste of the eel itself. The caterpillar roll tasted good but really paled in comparison to everything else!   The staff was quite attentive and helpful. I never had to wait for a refill of my drink.   The atmosphere is nice. I like the simplistic decor and light music.   I will be back again and again and again!",

He has a terrible attitude and doesn't give a crap if you have been a loyal customer for years. He has his sushi chefs talking about their person lives the whole time you are trying to enjoy a meal. A little tiny whole in the wall and if you want to eat here you better make a reservation it only sits around 20 people. Yoshi the owner will only take reservations so be careful. I went on a Sat at 5 p.m when there wasn't one person in the place and the owner turned us away without a reservation. It seemed a little like discrimination. I will never be going back. Hana, Squid Ink, Masa and even Saki Bomber are better places for so many reasons for ex. customer service, more seating and more affordable sushi.  The quality at other places is the same without the hassle!",

    "text": "I have lived here for nearly 10 years.  I acquired my sushi addiction back in NY/NJ and am always in search of some good quality fish.  Most places in AZ are a dime a dozen.  Nothing special, completely average and nothing to separate one from another.  But, then there is Shimogamo.  I have been here 10+ times.  This is my base for top notch sushi.  I have not been disappointed yet and I have tried a majority of their raw offerings.  Sit at the bar, grab a beer, some cold sake and prepare to have a food-gasm.  Their happy hour (7-days a week) prices are awesome.  Lots of nigiri, rolls, beer/sake and appetizers to choose from on that menu.  For the best eats, the list to focus on is the board behind the bar.  It has all their weekly specials.  The freshest items they get will be listed up there.  Do not hesitate to try new things.  Bonus points about this place is that the owner is Japanese!  Even back east that is a rarity.  Koreans (and even Chinese) own a large percentage of sushi joints.    The chefs here are great at just making something unique for you that isn't on the menu.  We usually get a round of some of our favorites, then let them freestyle the rest of the way.    Don't confuse pricey with over priced.  Great fresh fish is not cheap.  There are plenty of cheap sushi joints with all you can eat and less than stellar grades of fish.  If you always strive for better sushi and aren't content with the imitation crab (Krab = whitefish) that nearly 100% of other places use, step into the big leagues with Shimogamo.",

Being our first time at this place, we stuck to the basics and ordered several types of Nigiri and hot sake.  The Nigiri was excellent.  Although we tried some of the more exotic choices, we found that the basic salmon and albacore were our favorites.  Their house hot sake is also not your typical cheap and bitter California-brewed variety you get at most places.  Their's is both sweet and smooth and perfectly drinkable!  I love that they let you pick your own sake glass too.  We will definitely be back to Shimogamo!",

They used to have the freshest fish and now they have some really foul tasting tuna and salmon which has gotten me sick. They advertise their salmon as King Salomon but it really just tastes like raw canned salmon. As I'm a big fan of good Salmon, this will stop me from ever going back.  Service has gotten pretty bad also. The new waitress they have was about absent minded as can be.  The only things I still like at Shimogamo are the live sweet shrimp (ama ebi) and Sea urchin (Uni) but on the live sweet shrimp they have gotten very stingy as they only give you one head and they split the body in 2 pieces.  The establishment stank like rotten cabbage and I've noticed it being not well maintained behind the sushi bar. Another annoyance is that they are only open for lunch on Fridays now.  There are much better options around and at this momemnt Sushi Kee 3 blocks east on Warner (at Rural) is a lot better.",

My husband and I went in, not expecting much from the food, but we were pleasantly surprised.  The pork spare ribs were delectable with a slightly crunchy sweet crust.  We didn't try much else except the fish because it was so darn fresh!  You need to get here early on weekends because there are not too many tables.  Parking can be tough in the strip mall with the dim sum place next door.  I would give this place four stars but it is pricey for the portions.",

It was one of the best sushi restaurants that I have ever been to (I have been to a lot), and hands down the best I have been to in AZ.  We did as another reviewer recommended and, after giving our server some guidelines, allowed the chef and owner to send us whatever they wanted from the sushi bar and kitchen.  All of the sushi was very fresh and some of the dishes were as creative as they were delicious. However, our favorite was the miso cod from the kitchen.  In terms of price, our bill was in the $60 - 70 for two people, with a number of dishes and no alcohol.  Yes, this would be expensive for a weekly sushi dinner, but for a special occasion it was actually cheaper than other nice restaurants that we have been to. I recommend this restaurant for a special occasion for any sushi lover and for any occasion for the diner who can both appreciate and afford fine sushi.",

I agree with another reviewer, the best way to eat here is to put yourself in the hands of the sushi chef and kitchen cook and let them take care of you.  If you don't mind spending a bit more, they are open to creating an omakase for $50-100+range or tweaking a lunch special to suit your taste.  Best bets for lunch: Assorted sushi - $19 (or $30-35) if you want to upgrade to uni, ama ebi, toro if available/  Daily bento box lunch - $8.50 Super cheap and amazing, True Japanese comfort food.",

    "text": "So, I don't know why I left such a short review last time, but this place definitely deserves more of my attention, because they truly are awesome. Whenever we travel, my husband and I usually make it a point to try and find a good sushi restaurant. The truth is, I no longer want to do that because I am so satisfied with Shimogamo! As funny as that sounds, I know, strange to find sushi of that quality in the desert, but, it's there!   First off, this place is ALWAYS busy, if you go on the weekend, you will want to make a reservation for sure. In fact, you usually find a group of Japanese dining in the restaurant (a good sign of authenticity in my book) We've become such regulars, we have developed a nice relationship with the sushi chef and owner. They totally make us things off menu when we ask them too, (we have some favorite Japanese dishes we can find other places, far away, but not here) and they always do, and they make it well! For instance, one time they got in some fresh Sea Robin, we ordered the sashimi and then afterward they went ahead and fried the whole body for us to munch on, so good!!! (something we had seen at a restaurant in Vegas)   So, what to try? Uni. if uni is your thing, you'll want to get it here. It's always fresh, and AMAZING....if it's not up to par, they won't serve it. (you don't want to eat runny uni, fyi, but you won't find that here)   I never fail to order the Escolar (on the HH menu as well) it comes with a smoked pickled jalapeno on top, which at times can be really spicy, but sooooooo gooood....that's always a must for sure.   All of their sashimi is fresh and of the highest quality, and Zach, their head Sushi chef, often brings in fun, fancy ingredients to play with every now and then. (we got baluga caviar on top our uni last time! ) Every now and then he'll get some special fish, such as the sea robbin mentioned above, Spanish mackerel (aji)....etc. In fact, it's good to follow their instagram as they often post what specials they have, and what special ingredients came in for the week (@shimogamoaz)  Some of our favorite plates from the kitchen: absolutely have to get the truffle amberjack.....it's to die for. And we ALWAYS order the beef tongue, it's so good....be sure to dip it in the lemon juice they bring out with it!   As for service, they are a great bunch of people, but be forewarned, sometimes at their busiest times (think weekend evenings) service can lag a little. But, I think they may have recently hired more help, because the last time we went, there was a new waiter and service was spot on the whole night.  Bottom Line: You just can't go wrong with Shimo....",

We recently moved from San Diego, we have been looking for good sushi place so when my co-worker told me about this place I was really excited and couldn't wait to take my husband here. I took my husband today (nye) around 5:45 p.m  they had several open seats, we asked if we can seat at the bar however, the owner told us that he had no room and that we needed a reservation. We asked how long the wait would be and he said that he won't have anything available till 8:00 P.M.!!! We left disappointed (especially my husband) I called just to see to make a reservation and the owner told me that he can reserve two seats at the bar at 6:30 P.M!!! I wanted to go back but at this point my husband is already upset and very disappointed. We felt like the owner didn't want our business and we don't know why. We were both wearing a semi formal attire and look decent. So, I honestly DO NOT KNOW WHY HE DIDN'T want our business!! It was a very horrible experience, we have never been treated like this anywhere and we've been to much fancier places like Fogo de chao, Flemmings & etc. We will NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN.",

Very good sushi.  We've never done a nigiri omakase experience here, so no head-to-head comparisons with other sushi joints around the States, but based on the food we have ordered, we have a good idea of preparation and quality.  Pretty darn good for Arizona.  I don't believe it's the best in the Valley.  (My wife would disagree, she believes it's the best nigiri in the Valley.)  But almost every piece of nigiri we've ordered here has been very good, aged appropriately, appropriately cut, and well balanced.  This place is NOT a superior sushi establishment based on their rice.  Texture and temperature are mediocre, but at least it is seasoned correctly.  I have had a bad experience with the uni here.  I would not recommend it.  But, every oyster we've had here has been expertly prepared and delicious.  The variety of seafood is pretty good if you include any specials they may have.  It is pricier than other sushi joints in town of like quality, so another reason it is 4 stars.  No real huge complaints here (except the uni).  My father-in-law, frequent traveler to Japan, also approved of the sushi here, so there's that as well.",

We found it on YELP and it had good reviews and we figured it would be great, normally we do go to one of the cheaper rotating sushi places but honestly they kinda suck, but they cheap so who cares. But we had been going to another sushi place on Dobson and Ray that had been pretty good and thought we might try to see if Shimogamo was as good or better.   Well we got put in the back room with a large group that was very loud, mainly because the room was small but the group was also loud. Not a huge deal but a little annoying. What started to piss me off was how long it took to get the food. 45 Min for 2 rolls and 4 pieces of sashimi. The sashimi was good, fresh and tasted great. The two rolls we got were Alaskan roll and Caterpillar Roll, those sucked. They were tiny and the eel in the Caterpiller Roll was chewy and I think it was just the skin. The rolls were worse than what you get at rotating sushi bars. Just 3x as much money.   This places blows and I am pissed. $50 for 2 rolls, sashimi and edamame. Thats a joke. I am still hungry and never going back. I really want to know what these people are thinking that gave it 5 stars. Please inform me on what I am missing. I just don't get it.   I hope this place closes and I will hold the grudge for as long as they hold my $50, so I think forever, I wish they would just give me my money back. It really is how little food I got for how much it cost that really pisses me off.   I hate you Shimogamo. I really hate you.",

    "text": "Sushi rolls for the connoisseur (if there is such a thing).  Shimogamo's home in an Asian focused strip mall is a good indication that this place is the real deal.  Another indication is the need for a reservation, its a good idea to call ahead.  The only thing that did not feel authentic was the service with a smile, the service was impeccable.   The food: - The pan fried dumplings are obviously made in-house to order.  The flour dough wrapping had crispy edges and tasty filling.  Yum!   - The Big N' Spicy Roll was delicious and the spiciest roll I have ever had.  I am pretty hardcore when it comes to heat and I would call this medium.     - The Salmon Skin Roll is a little off the beaten path, again these were the best I have had anywhere bar none (e.i. Japan/Hawaii/CA/FL...).  I don't know if they shaved the skin, but it was crispy and oily (omega-3) almost like bacon (not-omega-3).  The table also shared a Roasted Roll, California Roll and a Futomaki Roll.  All of which were well made with fresh ingredients.   If you are going to try sushi once, try it here.  Just call ahead!",

The happy hour menu was very limited, and the portions were quite small ($3 for a very small bowl of eda mame - my 7-year-old plowed through 2 bowls on her own).  The best roll was the Citrus Roll, and even that was rather bland.  The service was okay.  The best thing about the place is the decor - very pretty.  There is also sufficient parking.  So, basically, everything about this place is \"just okay.\"  There were 2 adults and a child (who only had miso soup and eda mame), DURING HAPPY HOUR, and our bill was $65.",

So we called ahead for reservations at their 5:00 PM opening and were told we would \"have to be done in 1 hour\" because they had 18 reservations at or around 6:00.  That sounded a bit rude but we eat fast and decided that wouldn't be a problem, so we made the reservation and headed over.  You just don't go to a Japanese restaurant for American or Americanized food...that was our mistake and we take full responsibility for that.  We started with the pan fried dumplings (pot stickers in Chinese restaurants) and the Chicken Kara-Age, which were both very good. My wife ordered the breaded pork cutlet, which was OK, while I ordered the prime rib-eye, which was a major disappointment...the meat was served cold and very tough and flavorless.  Again, the Japanese food may very well be 5 star but we would not recommend this restaurant for it's American/Americanized food.",

The owner seats you but doesn't do much after that, and he's pretty quiet; not rude but no super friendly.  Two young guys are the sushi chefs.  The rolls are pretty good, but what does it for me here is the sushi.  They also have a really good bbq beef tongue.    If you happen to go between 5-7pm, they have a happy hour.  Some drinks, sushi, rolls, and appetizers at a discount.  Not a bad deal.  I've happened to dine twice during happy hour and ordered about half my meal off the HH menu and half off the regular menu.  Some fishes I crave aren't on the HH menu.  The atmosphere is laid back, and I've always gone dressed casual.  Some people do get dressed up but it's not necessary.    Try this place, it's legit!",

Like most of their other sushi it was really salty....REALLY REALLY REALLY SALTY. the wasabi had zero potency. The scallops was chopped up...booo, some other places do that too, the worst part was how much salt there was on it. they should have called that a salt roll with a hint of scallops.. BLECH!!!  I also ordered ton katsu curry...soo i got this because someone was raving about it. like the wasabi the curry lacked in the spice category, a lot. Not only that but the pork cutlet was so dried out...  and the panko also no spice at all and what in the world, had no flavor at all. it was like eating deepfried mush.   my over all rating.....2 because the staff was nice and friendly, otherwise i recommend going somewhere else for sushi/japanese food.. their spicy _\"enter random fish name here\"___ rolls all taste the same...super fail....and they weren't...yeah you guessed they weren't spicy at all",

I was excited to go since I saw the high praises specially for the happy hour. Anyway overall, it's forgettable. The rolls (salmon or cali) were so tiny that I wouldnt purchase it full price. I didn't know if that's really the portion of it (should be) or they lessened it since it's on happy hour? My most faves: Las vegas roll and salmon skin roll were not what I expected them to be. They were seriously lacking on flavor. Service was so-so. The lady was okay but the guy/greeter was rude. We were just looking at the soy sauce container and he said \"You dont open it\" while getting it from my hands. Geez. Calm yo self. Anyway over all, Id skip this joint. I know places much better and much worth the 62 bucks bill. One star for cleanliness, another for pretty presentation.",

As someone who checks the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FMaricopa.gov&s=0b46d6776bab6a60127f1676e7c80d488432bc94724149e82fcb172fc3620551\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maricopa.gov</a> site regularly on these restaurant checks, I  know that there are some citations that are really stupid (for example - they got cited for not putting the \"consuming raw fish etc is bad for your health\". Duh, it's a sushi restaurant. But, raw fish storage to me is important, since that's how many people get sick from sushi restaurants. As much as I liked this place, I am going to hold off a couple months until the next inspection to make sure this isn't re-occuring .",

We both ordered lunch trays and an order of the yellowtail tuna. I ordered the Crazy Bowl, which had mini fried shrimp over spicy tuna and rice. It was very delicious and healthy servings of both proteins. Hubby ordered the black cod tray, which tasted similar to sea bass. It was very buttery and luxurious. It was also served with a small side of what we described as whipped potatoes.   Both trays were served with salads and miso soup. I didn't really care for either so he gobbled it both up for the both of us. The yellowtail sushi was 6 pieces, just enough to share. It was pretty tasty and they were not skimpy on the filling at all.  Next time we will try to make a reservation for this cute private back room. Would be fun for a group dinner. Service was attentive and quick, no complaints there.",

I'm happy to say that I had a fantastic birthday dinner, and my guests didn't think I had terrible taste in restaurants.  The service here is really fantastic. Sushi places can sometimes be a bit slow, but everything here was out in no time at all. I had this fantastic roll they make with no rice, just yam batter, and the presentation was beautiful too. The entrees our guests had we're generously portioned, and really good as well. I was very happy with the quality of the fish, especially in my salmon rolls.  Our waiter was extremely helpful with their extensive saki list. I'm not a very adventurous drinker (I like craft beer and mules, and that's about it), so I was hesitant to try a carafe of their house saki. I'm glad I did, because it was delicious, light, smooth, and just a little sweet. I enjoyed it more than I like wine, and I'd definitely order it again.  I'd definitely go here again. The staff is fast and friendly and the ambiance of the restaurant is really nice. This is probably the best sushi I've had in Arizona outside of far pricier places in Scottsdale.",

Not great when there are 4-5 of you and each person is waiting out of courtesy to begin their meal.   There are numerous times where I have been here where they have been out of certain dishes due to issues with the kitchen.

We were seated promptly by, I believe, the owner.  Our waitress was attentive and quick.  We ordered a seaweed salad to start, which was very very good.  I had a lunch \"sushi platter\" which was 8 pieces of Nigiri, one tuna roll, and Miso soup for $19, an excellent value.  My wife had the \"Citrus Roll\".  She commented that it was excellent.  My sushi was fresh, well prepared, beautiful.  The Nigiri was beautifully presented, tasty and fresh.  The tuna roll was wrapped well.  Overall, I believe this was both an excellent value AS WELL as excellent food.  We will be returning!",

I didn't love any of the appetizers or rolls that I tried, in particular. I'd say it was just average. We were also stuck sitting at a tiny 2 top table in a room (almost seemed like a  private party type of room) where a party of about 10 women were already seated at a large table in the middle. So it was pretty loud and we eventually had to ignore or laugh at whatever the ladies were so loudly discussing. One thing that could be easily changed is the name of this place. I can't pronounce it and definitely can't remember it to tell a friend. I wasn't super impressed like I said, so I guess that won't be too much of a problem after all.",

He was more concerned with the white party of six walking from the parking lot than the person standing there in front of him asking for a table for 4. He ignored me the first time I walked in. Then when he finally acknowledged me he pointed to a table by the door and said that was the only table he had. I looked around and there were literally 2 other tables that were open. He seemed upset that he had to tell me where the bathroom was which by the way is in a separate restaurant next door. It was awkward walking in there because the people were like who the hell are you? He didn't even tell me where the bathroom was, I walked around a giant restaurant looking for it.

After digging around for recommendations I arrived at Shimogamo. My expectations were met and then some! My friend and I were seated at the bar with Zach, who was quick with recommendations and great conversation. The rest of the staff was warm and inviting and we felt right at home. I'm pretty simple with my sushi, I generally prefer sashimi or nigiri only and stay away from most intricate or fancy rolls. The flavors were fresh, clean, and delicious. We tore through orders of Halibut, Salmon, Saba(mackerel), tuna, kanpachi, amaebi, and more. Everything was good to to great and some dishes were just outstanding. The miso soup was solid, and the Sapporo was plentiful. We didn't order any of the more creative rolls but we did spy a few diners ordering them and watched the preparation of several and they looked excellent as well. Placed reservations for my next visit before I even left.",

    "text": "The sushi quest continues.  And we decided to check out one of the more promising places in the East Valley.  So we rolled into Shimogamo, a small place next to C-Fu Gourmet and across the street from Lee Lee Market.  With neighbors this Asian, they have to be legit, right?  The first thing I noticed was a nice list of fish and roll options, but a limited set of specials.  That's fine, maybe we can see if there's anything they're not telling us about... Or ask the chef to make us something interesting.  We started with the beef carpaccio.  Carpaccio is typically thinly sliced meat, served raw with some marinade, scallions, and other garnishes.  This one was supposed to be seared, but it came out medium.  It was pretty good, but could have been much better if it were actually served rare.  Next, we had something we asked the chef to surprise us with.  Disappointingly, the chef didn't come over and tell us what he made, and the waitress didn't seem to know.  But it involved a tempura-fried whitefish on a bed of Japanese veggies and a tough of tobiko.  It was good, but we were definitely hoping for something a little more interesting.  Probably the least memorable surprise we've had from a sushi chef yet.  Next, we had albacore and escolar sushi.  They were both good, and came garnished, so I didn't add any soy sauce to those... And they were conveniently on the happy hour menu.  Bonus!  We had a spider roll afterwards, and while I'm not usually a fan of rolls, I always like a good soft-shelled crab.  This one was better than some of the others I've had, on account of the fact that it also had avocado.   The waitress then brought us our shrimp sashimi (with the fried shrimp heads - make sure you ask for that if you order the fresh shrimp!).  These shrimp were huge, and fresh.  Plus, as an added bonus, the heads came stuffed to the brim with \"goodies.\"  I'm not exactly sure what the goodies are, but they have a distinct flavor, and I suspect it is a mix of central nervous system and the free-form liver/pancreatic capabilities that most crustaceans are endowed with.  We had the tuna poke, which seems to be Shimogamo's signature dish.  It tastes great, but it is quite basic.  Basically just tuna and avocado topped with a lightly fried quail egg.  This is one of those times when \"less is more\" is True.  After this, we had another item on the specials board, the orange yellowtail.  This is yellowtail sashimi marinaded with citrus flavor, served with sliced avocado and a touch of sriracha.  This was actually pretty delicious.  Finally, we finished with salmon roe and scallop nigiri, and quail eggs.  The salmon roe was some of the best I've had in awhile (they didn't have that fishy flavor that you sometimes get at a place with limited quality control).  Unfortunately, a few of the things we wanted to order were not available.  They didn't have any uni, baby yellowtail, or toro, which was really quite a bummer.  The owner explained to us that the market price is simply too high right now for him to be able to avoid throwing a bunch out, so I appreciate his willingness to only serve what he can guarantee to be fresh.  Some of this is the fault of their clientele, who from what I could tell, is very caucasian, and might not be interested in paying top dollar for a great cut of fish.    My final verdict on Shimogamo is that it's good, but a clear step below the best sushi places I've been to.  Everything was fresh, and the dishes were well-executed.  Furthermore, the prices were reasonable.  All of these make it a very respectable location, and potentially the best in the East Valley (we'll have to try the competition, of course).    Where they fall short is in two areas: first, the menu (and it seems the chefs) lack creativity.  They do a limited set of dishes well, but they don't seem to be food artists.  It's a little too generic.  Second, the waitress didn't seem very knowledgeable about some of the menu items, and had to ask the chef about a few things.  If she is relatively new, I could give her a pass.  Shimogamo may compete for the \"best in East Valley\" subcategory, but it can't quite hang in the top tier.",

It's fantastic!  We used to go every week, but are recently trying to save money.    My two tips are: make a reservation!  It's a small restaurant, which is a huge benefit.  And from all the times I have gone it looks like there's a lot of regulars, including myself.  This means that it fills up quickly.  We started making reservations and it's wonderful.  Your table is set and ready to go with menus when you walk in the door... On time!  Second tip: Go on Thursdays, Fridays, or Saturdays.  We think they get their fish shipment in on Wednesday or maybe Thursday morning. Also, I like the chefs on a lot more on those days.  Better cuts of fish, look, and overall taste.",

I am, however, very annoyed at the fact that they advertise takeout and I have called on two occasions and was denied my order.  The first time was last summer and they said that it was too hot outside.  Really?!?!?  I called tonight and they said that they were too busy.    I strongly suggest that the restaurant inform their customers of the possibility that they will refuse to take an order.",

All the rolls were delish, but relatively small compared to other sushi places.  Tempura was more on the greasy side, but had a good variety (shrimp, carrots, green chili, onion, green bean and eggplant).  Tempura ice cream was great.  They give you 1 green tea and 1 vanilla covered with a lightly pound cake and tempura batter.  Only reason why I gave it a 4 star is the size of the rolls, other than that great tasting sushi!",

    "text": "What happened to Shimogamo? I had a good experience there 2 years ago. It was a 4 star sushi restaurant for me that time with good quality of food and service and that's why we went back there for our 3rd wedding anniversary. But our anniversary was totally ruined.  Their service was terrible, just terrible. The only thing they did right was taking order of our drinks and brought them quick. After that things just went wrong in every way. It was  like we were totally not served.   For starter, we ordered beer and they only brought the bottle, no glass although other tables got glasses. That was fine. We tried to get a glass but the waiter never came back to us, even to take orders. We couldn't find the waiter for about 10 mins so we decided to order things we could order directly to the chef at the sushi bar we were seating.  Then they forgot to bring 2 out of 8 dishes we ordered including our appetizer. My husband got his dish around 20 mins after ordering and I had to wait another 15 minutes for mine. My husband finished his drink but had to wait for 20 minutes to get another drink. We again waited for 20 mins for just for the bill, etc.. And every time we needed something, we had to wave them as they never come by us. \"Waiting\" is the word that explains our experience at Shimogamo this time.   It seemed the chefs at the sushi bar and waiter/waitress were confused about orders all the time. They brought at least 3 dishes to wrong tables. We heard someone dropped dish(es) with a big noise in the kitchen.  Even the quality of sushi was not good this time. The fish was totally not fresh and didn't taste almost at all. It's a fast food restaurant quality.  I think this was our worst experience at a restaurant ever. Sometimes we get not-so-good service or they forget our order but I've never seen my husband so disappointed before. He is a sweet person and gives at least 20% tip even if they forget our order but this time, he only left 15% tip. But I understand that after seeing him waiting miserably for his drink for 20 mins trying to get attention from them without success. Yes, we just felt ignored and miserable. A waitress even got to the sushi bar and asked the chef in front of us whether he's thirsty and needed something to drink but my husband was totally left without any drink for too long.  And for the first time, I heard my husband saying \"I will never go back to the restaurant.\"",

The fish is so fresh - I usually prefer it on its own, not in a roll.  I feel like usually I order rolls because the fish isn't so great so I'd like some mayo concoction to hide the taste of the fish.  Not so here.  Escolar is the best.  Salmon is incredible.  Tuna - yum.  You can't go wrong.  There's a poke appetizer that they sometimes have that is outstanding.  Ambiance is pleasant, staff is nice, but the fish... oh the fish.  Any time I want sushi and I consider another place, I'm like, why?  Who are we kidding let's just go to Shimogamo.  Go - you won't regret it.",

I would say the rolls do taste fresh and light. Happy hour gives a modest $1-2 off regular prices on rolls. Overall, I thought the place was OK.   The main reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because my party of three was asked to leave to make room for another group. I have never been asked to leave a restaurant -- it was very abrupt and kinda rude. My party said that we never experienced something like that before. This is not a place I would come back to.",

This place is REAL sushi. If you want fried cream cheese in your sushi go elsewhere. The owner is a man from Kyoto and he isn't doing much pandering to American palates.  The highlight of this place is the actual quality of the fish. The nigiri sushi is what you should order so you can fully appreciate the flavor and texture. I'd recommend the unagi, the salmon, and the escolar to get you started. All exquisite.",

The owner Yoshi and his wife  (she's usually busy in the kitchen) have a jewel in the ruff in Shimogamo.    For those fans of Japanese curry (I know it's not sushi!) mamasan makes it from scratch and it isn't on the menu. Try a katsu curry plate for dinner sometime. It will blow your tastebuds and mind!

I come here for lunch almost every Friday as that's the only day of the week they do lunch. I have been here for dinner many times as well and it's very good. This review will discuss lunch.  Get here very close to 11:30 if you're coming on Friday for lunch. There are tons of regulars and the sushi bar will be filled in the first few minutes so it's ideal to get here right around 11:30.  When I come for lunch, I get the same thing every time. It's a variation of their sushi special, but instead of a cut roll, I just get some more nigiri. This is without a doubt, the best quality:price ratio in existence when it comes to sushi. 11 pieces of well-crafted, fresh nigiri, with thoughtful and delicious garnishes. I have also been there when the have live shrimp and it's well worth the splurge.   Service is always good. Overall, this is probably my favorite place to go for lunch, even if it's only open on Fridays.",

The rolls were decent, but again nothing that would excite me about coming back.  Service was good and they offer happy hour pricing 7 days a week.  Now while that sounds great, the $7.50 rolls on the list are pretty small; so yes you pay a lower price; but it's the equivalent of getting 1/2 rolls in some places.  Overall service was good, but the sushi was just ok and not enough for us to travel from Tempe here again.",

We sat down at a 2 person table by the sushi bar to look at the menu, and we couldn't even think because the sushi chef was so loud. One of the first things I heard him shout was his experience with \"hookers and blow\". He made several more loud references to crack and cocaine throughout our dining experience, which, in my opinion, is tasteless. Keep that between you and your buddies after hours.  The sushi chef was loud the entire time, and he was talking to the couple at the bar who were right in front of him (no need to shout). We placed our order and proceeded to wait..and wait..and wait. 30 minutes later the sushi chef shouted out our order to the kitchen (for the cooked items). He had the order in front of him the whole time. Meanwhile several more patrons show up and sit at nearby tables and the sushi bar. Within minutes the people at the sushi bar had rolls and appetizers. About 40 minutes after placing our order we finally got part of our order.   Long story short: great place if you are the party that's getting preferential treatment. If not, be prepared to wait (and bring earplugs).",

We were quickly seated and we took a look at the HH menu and figured out what we wanted. We shared an order of the shrimp tempura, and I had a California roll and spicy tuna roll and my friend had a Vegas roll and rainbow roll. Our server was very nice, but the time between his stops at our table and how the food came out was really long. It took probably 10 minutes for our appetizer to come out, and then from the first sushi roll coming out, it probably took another 10 minutes to get all 4 of our rolls on the table. They weren't overly busy, but it looked like food was coming out to different tables at different times which seemed strange. My rolls were okay - nothing mind blowing. While I waited a lot, I was fascinated by a little private room they have in the back which was super cute and chic. The restaurant has a very NY vibe to it. I'll probably return",

I sat at the bar and ordered from their happy our menu.  While sitting there I noticed the sushi chef very engaged with the other customers at the bar.  He new them by name and was servicing them some interesting rolls that were obviously not on the menu.  Being the outgoing person I am I asked and was introduced to some great chef inspired rolls.  The Shimogamo roll (that is on the menu) was amazing.  It was fresh and just fantastic.  Sitting next to me was a regular who ordered a Diamondback roll (being in AZ) that was great.  They make a sauce with roasted jalapenos and other asian inspired ingrediants.  Awesome.    The service was excellent, the staff was fantastic and the customers great!  This is my go to place while in Chandler.  Check it out!!",

As we walked in I remember saying to myself, man I expected this place to be bigger, but it had a nice cozy feel to it in my opinion and the decor was nice. Never being here before we just kind of stood by the door til someone finally greeted us and took us towards the back, a lonesome 2 top. Lol As much as I can eat I was thinking this table definitely isn't going to be big enough but guess we will see!  I ordered for us, BBQ Beef tongue- pretty delicious for being a tongue off an animal esp with the sea salt and lemon juice they give you. UNI sashimi- super delicious and sweet, melted in my mouth. Big and spicy roll- pretty yum but not my favorite  Baby Lobster and Crab salad- super delicious and pretty decent amount of meat. White Truffle Amberjack- mild flavor, not fishy   And a few other things I can't remember...  Service was nice and friendly, but definitely kind of slow, but I was too busy eating to really notice for the most part.",

I met my friend here for happy hour last week. We ordered so many rolls that I can't even remember them all. The philly roll, las vegas roll, shimogamo roll, and much much more and ended with some oysters.   We sat at the bar and everyone was extremely friendly. I thought that the sushi was actually reallyyyyyy fresh. I love Philly rolls so I always have to try them everywhere I go. This was probably the best Philly roll I've ever had. It was everything I asked for. lol. They also have drink specials as well. My friend ordered some sake while I got their Red house wine. Two of those glasses and I was gone. lol.   I felt like it wasn't HAPPY hour because even with happy hour pricing it was still pretty expensive. I think everything came out to about $70+. Doesn't sound like happy hour pricing to me. lol.   I would definitely come back though. I really loved everything and it's so close to my home. I left completely satisfied. =)",

As a California native I have lived in Arizona 7 years and just about gave up on finding places for sushi. This place is classy, authentic and definetly a cozy traditional sushi restaurant; although it is quite elegant in the inside the real stars are the excellent service and exceptional food. The mixed tempura was hands down the best I've eaten while living here. The fish was fresh and tasty; just absolutely delightful.  I will be telling EVERYONE I know about this place, and will be visiting in my dreams until we meet again.  Try it, you won't like it you'll love it!",

We walk in and are asked for reservations by an older man by the host post. Didn't realize we needed one. Inform him we do not have one and he just shakes his head. Continues to tell us he doesn't have an availability. We ask if there's a wait and how long that might be, he chuckles and says he has too many reservations and doesn't think we'd get served. We're not sure if we're  just reading too much into it but we walked away very disturbed. We understand not having an avaliability but how it was handled left such a bad taste in our mouths. His response was rude and the exchange was very odd. It just came off as if we weren't good enough to eat there. Never had quite an experience like that.",

    "text": "I was a little disappointed in Simogamo but that is probably just because my expectations were too high since there are so many reviews raving about this place. I am certainly not a sushi or Japanese food expert but I thought that the descriptions of their rolls sounded kind of boring and unoriginal. So, I went with the sushi sampler instead which is 8 pieces of nigiri and a plain tuna roll for $19. Clearly not exciting stuff but it ended up that I loved all of it! The strength of this place definitely is the freshness of their fish. All of it tasted like the very highest quality. One of them was a fish I had never tried before (already forgot the name, ugh) and I really loved, one was mackerel which I usually can't stand but this one was very mild and tasty, and once was octopus which was the best I have ever had.  Another plus was that they do offer many other Japanese entrees besides sushi so the hubby was able to get some teriyaki spare ribs and that put a big smile on his face. Their prices were a little higher than our favorite sushi place but still reasonable. The service was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The ambiance was not as nice as I was expecting but again that was based on the rave reviews... really for a mom and pop joint in a suburban shopping strip it is pretty nice. I was a little surprised at how small it was - this is for sure a date night place, it wouldn't really work for a big group or family meal.  So, even though it probably won't replace Mido as our go-to sushi place (seriously they are so cheap!)  I would definitely return to Shimogamo just for the quality of the fish. If you like sashimi or nigiri this is the place for you. If you prefer places like Ra with all the crazy rolls with a bunch of stuff in them and sauces drizzled on them or ayce type sushi places then this may not be your best bet.",

I read that they often get packed during prime hours, so when I saw they take OpenTable reservations I booked it right away.   We arrived, and were greeted by name at the door and seated right away. They weren't completely full, but still at about 75% capacity of their smaller restaurant. It was also happy hour, so we got the full menus, happy hour menus, and a nice order sheet for the sushi so we could just mark what we wanted on that. Waitress was at our table immediately to take our drink order. She was super polite, and extremely efficient.  We ordered 3 rolls and the gyoza appetizer. The Spicy Yellowtail roll showed up within minutes, followed shortly by the gyoza. Both were amazing. I'm usually not a dumpling fan, but these were lightly fried and crispy on a bed of sauce. The yellowtail roll was extremely flavorful compared to other places we've eaten. We barely finished those before our Shimogamo and Las Vegas rolls arrived. Nice presentation, and we were both amazed at how you could taste all the distinct flavors separately in the rolls. The touch of lemon in the Shimogamo roll was just perfect, and seemed to only come through at the end.   I'm no food critic, but eating here made me want to try to describe the food like one. The happy hour prices were awesome, and they're so efficient we were in and out in 35 minutes. And no pictures because we were hungry when we started and didn't want to stop until we were done!  We're going to be regulars now I think. Fantastic.",

Ask for the wagyu beef, it's pricey but totally worth it, we splurge every now and then when available and get the skewers, the meat is so tender that it will melt in your mouth.

    "text": "Without a doubt the freshest sushi I've ever eaten. I stuck to the plan of \"order what's on the special board\" and \"take the server's advice\" and it didn't fail me. At all.  I love me some spider crab. Most places it's over cooked and/or gets drowned out by the other flavors in the roll. Not this time. Loads of crab flavor.  And the unagi was sublime. I normally pass, as the over-sweet sauce just doesn't cut it for me. But I gave it a shot. Wow. Skip the sauce. Just enjoy the incredible flavor. Wonderful.  Their rice-less roll (tsunami?) was sublime. Every bite was fresh layered on top of fresh. The tempura battering was light and flakey. Highly recommended.  The only strikes were selection. Two of the items we ordered weren't available. Not necessarily a bad thing, as I think that speaks to the the freshness. They order enough for the day. And we ate late, so I'm not terribly surprised they were out.   That, and the under-chef convinced me to forgo the ikura with quail egg in favor of tobikko with quail egg. It was good, and in his defense he offered to not charge me for it if I didn't like it. But I did like it. Just not as much as I would have if I would have capped my meal with the ikura/quail combo. Mine may not be traditional. And it may be heretical. But it's fab. So I'll get that next time and stick to my guns.  Because, oh yes... we'll be back!",

I shouldn't judge, I make an awesome spaghetti carbonara.  Ask the chef what he'd recommend for the day off the white board.  The sushi & sashimi is uber fresh and probably the best in the E.V., with the kampachi (Hawaiian yellowtail) being the fave... delicate taste and firm flesh (doesn't mushy fish gross you out??).  Next time I'd save my $ on the toro to get more kampachi!  The rolls were great, Big & Spicy and Futomaki!  That said, I'd stay away from the panko anything.  We did the assorted platter -...worst.deep.fried.Japanese.ever.  The oil tasted old or the panko off (is that even possible?), but we had the gamut of salmon, pork chop, vegs, a shrimp and oyster... it was just plain bad.  You're going here for sushi and sashimi, stick with it!",

When we walked into the restaurant it seemed a little busy not too crowded. We were willing to wait to be seated. However, an older man who might have been the owner walks over to us saying there is no table for us. We just stood there thinking we will wait. He just kept repeating no table as if our business was not welcome. I was very offended and walked out. It almost ruined our anniversary dinner. This has never happened to me before and we will never go back to this restaurant. They only seem to be welcoming customers who are worthy in which we were clearly not.",

We sat at the Sushi bar and our Chef (Al) answered all our silly question with a smile.  Yep, we are pretty silly.  Anyways, we pretty much plundered the awesome Happy Hour menu with my addition token Yellowtail Nigiri.    We ordered: Fried Chicken (amazing) Unagi Sake (Salmon) Yellowtail Shimogamo Roll Panko Roll  1 Sake Bomber 2 small sakes  The Nigiri was super fresh and far outweighed the rice it sat on.  The roll were prepped with super care and they looked fab!  My personal Fave was the Panko Roll.  It was the very subtle in its flavor.  The sauce around the side of the plate was perfect and the one dot of Sriracha put it over the top.  We walked out with all that food for under $50.  It was perfecto, thanks and I will be back!",

I love sushi but its been so hard to find a place that has good enough fish where it reminds me of eating clouds (yes, good fish should taste more like clouds than fish!)  Anyways, the 5 stars is not because it is the best fish I have ever had, but it is the closest thing I have gotten in the state. The price is higher than other sushi bars in the area, but once you try it, you'll understand why. The quality of fish it top notch and the sushi chefs will even tell you which fish is in season. I first ordered a sake bomber (large beer and small sake) for $6.50. We ordered the Agedashi tofu and mixed veggie tempura. The tofu had a great soft, almost custard like, texture and tasted perfect. The tempura was good, nothing exciting to note. For entree, we got the Chirashi bowl, a spicy yellowtail roll, crazy roll, yellowtail sashimi and albacore sashimi. The chirashi was a very pleasant surprise with the amount of fresh cut fish but what solidified our decision for best sushi in AZ thus far, was the sashimi. The albacor was PERFECT and made me reminisce about the best sushi I had in Seattle, which did taste like clouds in my mouth. The dessert special of the day was crepes and they made my mouth very happy and was a perfect end to the meal.  Overall, with the Yelp Check-in and 10% off our bill, we got out of there for $81 including tax and tip. As a said before, not cheap but not a bad price considering all that was ordered.   Note: if you plan to come here on a Friday, its best to make a reservation because it can get crowded. Also happy hour is until 7pm.",

I made sure to call ahead to set a reservation for our group of 10. The owner was very kind and thru broken English let me know they don't like to split checks for that size [but our server let us do it anyway haha]. It wasn't terribly busy since we picked a weeknight. Pretty much everyone in my group ordered sushi. The few who did not received their food first. My friend and I decided to split spicy salmon, citrus, and another roll. Despite my initial hesitation in ordering it, I loved the citrus roll - wasn't too citrus-y, had a great balance of many flavors [umami?].   The place missed the mark though with their service. I totally understand bringing a group to a sushi joint where everything is created to-order can be a hassle and time-consuming. But how they went about serving us all was annoying. Everyone ordered at the same time, and slowly but surely they brought out everyone's food one at a time. By the time the first person who ordered was done eating, my friend and I barely had touched our rolls. Wish they would've done a roll for everyone and then go onto any other rolls ordered. That way we were't starving for 45 minutes looking at other's plates.   Spent ~$25 for myself and was definitely worth the cost though.",

Nice wine selection that we matched to our meal. The owner was very nice to us and took time to talk and answered some novice questions we had on the cuisine. The waitress was excellent and made our dinner fun and when asked took a nice pic of us to document our excellent dining experience. Shimogamo is the best Japanese restaurant experience that I have had.",

Quiet and serene, the waiter was nice. The food was fantastic! Flavorful! And well prepared. The squid salad was soo flavorful and wasn't over powering in vinegar sauce like most squid salads, the beef tongue was sooo delicious and the meat wasn't dry at all. Sake bombs were awesome and they gave us a whole bottle each and I was like dear lord I hope I remember this night lol.  The sashimi was soooo good, the texture was rich and the color was pure, and THE FLAVOR WAS EVERYTHING. The environment, the service, the food, and the location was fantastic. I've never been sooo pleased by a hole in the wall sushi spot in my life! I've already RSVP'd for the following weekend. You can go by yourself and still have a great time honestly",

The Citrus Roll was excellent and I highly recommend trying that roll.   My boyfriend and I were sat in the back room on this visit and it was nice in that room - minus the creepy painting on the wall of a torture room or something?? That painting is hideous and grosses me out. It looks like a room from a Saw movie. Who wants to looks at that while they eat raw fish?  Anyway, the 2nd visit was much better but still I'm not sure if I will be back. I hate it when restaurants are inconsistent in regards to their food. Service I can understand, but I think the food should always be consistent.",

For me, Shimogamo has some of the top sushi in Arizona  and I could come here every day for the dessert ha.  The family that owns this place are so nice and friendly, they are constantly on top of things and will assist you when needed. The atmosphere is relaxing, I like that it is a tiny little restaurant in the corner :)  We ordered the Shimogamo roll, the Panko roll and oh gosh.. I can't remember the last one we had *facepalm, all I know is that it had rice paper around it and it was very light, not heavy at all; SO GOOD!  Even their sashimi is amazing, it was very fresh and worth the money. Well, in general, this place is worth the money.  The desserts though, they have red beans and rice cake (I love both of those things) and mochi icecream.. wooooooooo! So good.  OH OH and the chicken katsu was really good too! I prefer chicken over pork, so I don't know how the pork tastes, but the chicken was yummy!  Anywho, I highly recommend this place, you will not be disappointed!",

That one time, they were slammed and my rolls were not on par with how they were on other visits.   Last night, we went for my best friend's b-day, and Yoshi (the owner I think) gave the b-day boy a free \"Stamina Drink\".. I had a small sip it. Tasted like isopropyl alcohal on ice with a splash of grape flavor. So.. pretty legit.   On the way out, Yoshi told my friend, \"Your life is wrong!\" then burst into laughter. This was hilarious to me. I asked my friend if maybe he meant, \"Your life is LONG?\" maybe just a pronunciation error?? But WRONG is much funnier. Good Times :)",

The rolls were a little small but they were tasty. I wish the rice had a little more seasoning, but it was definitely not bad at all!  I also ordered  the sunomono salad, which had shredded crab meat in it as well as some seaweed. It was very yummy but maybe a little too much vinegar. No big deal!  My boyfriend ordered the shrimp tempura, calamari and chicken cutlet. He was not a fan of the calamari - it was a little tough and way spicy. That's okay - the rest of the food he said was delicious!  Overall it was a little pricey for what we got ($56 for two people), but it was great. I'd recommend them to anyone in the area!",

My fiance and I would go and eat up $60-$70 worth of sushi and we would be getting the check and heading to In and Out.  Not because we're pigs (both of our BMI are under 19), but because the amount is so tiny.  I have no idea how they justify charing half of your mortgage to eat there, it's not THAT good.  I would pay $70/piece to eat if Chef Nobu was cooking.  Skip this place and head to Sushi In Motion in downtown Chandler (see my review).

I ordered ice water and got water from a tap, not even filtered. they used tap water for my wife's green tea and that was not even tea, they used a powder mix that stuck to her straw. those who say this place was good don't know what sushi is. smaller and more expensive does not better or higher quality. not ever going here again. don't blame the chefs because they are working with what the owners give them. one more thing for the owners... when you blowtorch your sushi, it just tast like gas fumes. what person does not know that uncooked fish captures the flavors of everything? why the hell are you gas lighting anything that has to do with sushi? totally wasted my money on poor food that I now am sick because of. avoid this place. it looks pretty but it comes with a price.",

The husband and wife team who own and run this place personally work everyday, ensure high standards for the overall dining experience; he works the dining area, and she is head chef in the kitchen. The highlight dishes were the Spanish Mackerel sashimi with the bones deep fried, the fine kelp soup with taroro, an outstanding delicate citrus miso dressing on the daikon radish & cucumber salad, the emaebi with spectacular deep fried heads, wild alaskan salmon and impressively fresh uni.

Man they were not kidding.  Drinks went empty several times, tried to order a second round of sushi only to change our minds after our waiter walked by our table without taking the filled out menu at least 5 times.  Then it took another 20minutes to settle the bill, which by the way was outrageous.  I would never go back and I would never recommend it to anybody.  I can get happy hour sushi a mile up the road for a fraction of the price in half the time and they will smile at me while I keep ordering.  Good food is one part of having a restaurant, its usually not the most important part.  People pay for good service and that is what keeps them coming back.  I will never go back to Shimogamo.",

    "text": "I love this place so much.  After going to several sushi places in the Valley, in my book, this place ranks as the best in terms of atmosphere, food quality, affordability, and service.  Happy hour from 5-7 every day is the best time to come.  The quality of the food, from the tempura to the miso soup to the sushi itself are incredible.  I paid around $60 with the 10% check-in discount for a group of 5, mostly ordering items from the happy hour menu, which is extremely affordable given the quality of food.  I would happily come here again and bring my friends to try out some of the more adventurous menu items like the Uni and Toro.",

They had a Kobe beef roll and a delicious looking okonomiyaki that was served at the other table... Next time I will definitely try those. I wanted to grab some standard sushi because the sushi chef was fantastic. I've watched sushi chefs my whole life, really really good ones, Japanese born and bred, through all the rigor and tests... In Hawaii and japan. The young man behind the bar crafting the sushi has the talent to go quite far. I think his name was Seth, but I'm not sure. I will get it next time. If you ever read this: you are good! Keep practicing and I think you will make a great ryoricho one day, head your own restaurant. I will bring you business! Just one thing.. Learn the Japanese pronunciation!  Fish was pretty fresh, i inspected closely! The hamachi had a hint of bitter orange, I found out later there is an orange-hamachi, that must be where that came from. Miso-mayo is a good aioli, very few places use it, normally I need to just make it at home. My compliments, I will be back later, and I will tell everyone I know about shimogamo. The sushi bar not Kyoto!",

Small cozy atmosphere we always sit at the sushi bar (Tip if u want most experienced chef sit to far left of bar) really good happy hour 7 days a week 5-7. All of the fish is not older than 48 hours. I can not tell you how amazing the service and food is. My only negatives 1. busy on weekends 2. Kinda pricey if you don't go during happy hour. 3. Recent sushi chef changes. But with all that if u want sushi that's on point then go here. Love this place!",

    "text": "I frequent many sushi bars in the area and I would not recommend this place at all. My usual meal at every sushi restaurant is a chirashi bowl and a spicy tuna roll. A chirashi bowl is a bowl of mixed sashimi on a bed of rice. For me it is always a good way to determine just how good the sushi restaurant because this bowl has almost every type of sashimi you find on their menus - albacore, tuna, salmon, squid, egg, yellowtail, tuna belly, fish eggs, etc.  Now concerning Shimogamo, not only were the portions very small for both the chirashi bowl and the spicy tuna roll, there was absolutely no flavor in the fish, neither did it look fresh. They charge high prices here -the chirashi bowl was $25, the spicy tuna roll was $6.25. The rice in the chirashi bowl was also dry, hard, and not cooked properly to be sushi rice  I would recommend going to Sakana, specifically the location in ahwatukee. Portions are good sized, the fish is fresh, has flavor, and prices are reasonable. A chirashi bowl at Sakana is $16 while a spicy tuna roll is about $6. Also they are always consistent here, which is a huge factor in Japanese restaurants.   If you don't believe give Shimogamo a shot, Sakana in ahwatukee a shot, and then you'll realize how much time, money, and effort you've wasted.",

    "text": "Pros: *Quaint, clean, and classy ambiance in a small package.            *Fish cut well            *service friendly enough.  Cons: *Sushi rice was bland and undercooked.            *Some lesser ordered fish failed to deliver on freshness.             This is a small spot located / connected to C-Fu Gourmet in Chandler. Great things come in small packages, and I was excited to see what this charming little place had to offer. The place is clean, classy, and comfortingly familiar if you make a practice of seeking out the smaller guys.   Young kids behind the sushi bar, which I do my best not to sway my verdict...but does raise the question of experience. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that the twenty something ASU kids are incapable, but the classic sushi chefs are apprenticed for years, and don't even get to touch the fish for the entire first year. They spend that first year learning how to perfect the rice. I raise this point NOT in order to boast about my familiarity with the art of sushi, but because the rice was Shimogamos greatest failing.   The order: All sushi (nigiri) *Mackerel (Saba), Salmon Roe (Ikura), Tuna (Maguro), Eel (Unagi), Albacore (Shiro Maguro), Yellowtail (Hamachi)  The fish itself in all fairness was cut well, portions are modest and not atypical but the freshness seemed to take a hit on some of the less commonly ordered fish. Mackerel is an extremely \"fishy\" fish and spoils quickly and usually served salt cured and washed in rice vinegar, but this process often leads to over curing it or just letting it hang out for a little longer than it should which seemed to be the case. We usually save the Unagi, a cooked eel, with a sweet teriyaki like sauce for last, it's like a sushi dessert, like the cherry on top, the wonderful last bite to end your meal, this was not the case. The Unagi was dry, old, stringy, and tendon-y...not as hoped. Even the eel sauce failed to cover this up, which lets be honest, is so rich that it often can.. All of this, and the rice. That poor rice, embarrassingly flaunted around in its undercooked, flavorless garb, passed off and billed as sushi rice. This was not sushi rice...this was your college roommate's rice cooker at work, and though the maguro, and shiro maguro cuts of fish were cut just fine (and presumably because of their high order rate, kept fresh) the failing of that rice pulled the rug right out from under them....literally.  It was so undercooked and poorly packed that it fell apart as you gingerly lifted them up with your chopsticks. The irony here is that the fresh fish was great, the minor missteps happened in the details, the cooked or brined fish, and of course the rice. If we had skipped the mackerel and unagi and ordered everything sashimi instead, this could be a glowing 3 or even a 4 star review.  Total for the order came to $70, plus tip. The company from behind the bar was friendly which always makes this kind of review more difficult. Perhaps the rice was just off that night. Guess we won't know unless we try again.",

    "text": "Chandler residents, try this place if you like Sushi.  If you live around Chandler/Mesa area, you know how hard it is to find a descent sushi place unlike areas around north Scottsdale.    We ordered few appetizers, multiple sushi and few rolls.  The appetizers and the sushi were pretty good for the most part.  But I do have to mention that the rice for one of the sushi was horrifying.  I've never had rice fall apart on me when I tried to pick it up.  It was soggy and all I could taste was sugar.  Honestly, I'm amazed that the rice kept its nigiri shape on the plate.  I don't know what happened on that particular sushi but yeah, that was unappetizing.  The rolls were ok but nothing special at all.  The portions were tiny and the flavor was barely there.    So, from our point of view, this restaurant is pretty much on the same level as Kabuki in Old Town Pasadena, CA with an authentic Japanese sushi restaurant feel b/c of the presence of Japanese staff and the decor.  That being said, it was really interesting to us because usually, a non-authentic sushi restaurants try to cover their lack of skill by serving pretty good rolls (which is basically an Americanized sushi.)  But this place served better sushi than rolls.  So kudos to them.  Hence, it affected my rating along with the location to 4 stars.        *Location = thank goodness that there is at least one pretty good sushi place around Chandler area *Food = pretty good *Service = very good *Atmosphere = nice and hip *Price = expected for AZ sushi place = over $100/a couple",

We ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer, an assorted tempura appetizer, a lobster appetizer, and yakisoba.  When we got home the order was totally wrong. Instead of lobster we were given mussels (which were gross), instead of assorted tempura and shrimp tempura we only got assorted tempura with 2... that's right only 2 shrimp in the whole mix.  The yakisoba was the only part of the order they got right and it was not that great, pretty bland.  I love Japanese food and I was really excited to find a place near by and while we were waiting for our order we were excitedly planning to come back and have their sushi, but after this complete mix up and poor quality food there is no way I would trust them with anything raw.

    "text": "My dentist recommended this place to me five years ago and every since then, I keep a keen ear to any of her recommendations as Shimagamo is the best sushi I've had anywhere.  I've had sushi in CA, NY, TX and HI.     The fish tastes fresh and the portions are generous.  One piece of advice is to eat at the sushi bar rather than one of the booths, assuming you are having sushi.  In my experience, sushi tastes better served as soon as each sushi piece prep is done rather than waiting for the entire sushi order to be completed.  This place has the best Unagi and an awesome Escolar (which I haven't found anywhere else.)  The Suprise Crazy Roll, served with a sweet wasabi sauce, is always on our Sushi order.  The only con is that this place is pricey, but they do have a daily 5-7 happy hour that contains some great options.  However, the best stuff is usually not on the happy hour menu.  Also, this isn't a place to have Sake bombs.  It's a very low key atmosphere for those just looking for an excellent meal.  You'll likely notice early on how many folks are regulars.  I was told this was the spot where many Japanese baseball players come to have their Sushi.  The restaurant is very non-descript.  It sits in a corner of a shopping mall and is easily overshadowed by it's neighbor C-Fu Gourmet.",

We've been accustomed to the overly fried and overly saucy sushi from over-hyped places like Ra and Sushi 101.

In the case of Shimogamo, their sushi rice has a good balance of moisture and rice vinegar without being overly sticky. They offer a large variety of sashami and of the fish I have tried, their fish quality is good especially considering the price. I love their albacore tataki salad, which is actually a better value than buying the albacore alone.   Shimogamo excels at their selection of appetizers. They offer some Japanese dishes that can be hard to find at most other sushi places, such as BBQ beef tongue or fried oyster. While I haven't had the beef tongue yet, I have tried their fried oyster, beef carpaccio, and dynamite lobster. They were all very good, which leaves me optimistic for the other appetizers.   When my wife and I eat here, we generally order quite a few dishes and spend about $20-25 per person. While it is easy to find far cheaper sushi places in the Phoenix area, this place offers a higher quality and more interesting variety that makes the price well worth it. Shimogamo is quickly becoming one of our regular favorites.",

We ordered the pork goyza to start from the happy hour menu.  There was only one chef, so we expected to wait for the food, but it arrived quickly and it was steaming hot!  We also ordered the Viva Las Vegas roll, the Crazy roll and the Philly roll.  We also ordered sushi (raw fish on rice).  I had the Salmon (Sake), Escolar (White Tuna) and the Albacore (Shiromaguro).    Wow!  It was all so fresh and delicious!  The rolls were flavorful, full of fish, tightly rolled and had amazing flavor, but...the sushi!  Being from Arizona, I haven't had a ton of sushi other than Ra or Kabuki, and Shimogamo kicked them out of the water!  It was so flavorful!  The texture was light, fresh and melt in your mouth.  I have never had better sushi.    The entire staff was so friendly, from the host who seemed so happy we were there to our server who never let our glasses go dry.

First thing he does is stare at my daughter like it's taboo to bring a child to his establishment so I get this funny feeling things aren't going to go too smooth. He asks us if we have a reservation I say no do we need one? He replies no you don't, then why ask? He says well there is nothing available at the moment to which I say is fine how long will the wait be? He looks at his watch and says I don't know it depends on the customer. Now I have been to many many restaurants in my lifetime and everytime there is a wait the place usually knows around how long the wait will be. I told me wife that I feel we're not wanted here and she had the same feeling and we decided to just leave. Naturally we tried to figure out why the old man would treat us this way and couldn't figure it out, my only conclusion was that he didn't want my daughter in there because maybe he thought she would have been noisy and could've disturbed his other customers. Granted she would have been the only child in there but she's a really good girl and has been out with us many times. Really disappointed in the way he made us feel and was hoping to find our favorite Sushi place but we will never return here as they don't seem to family friendly.",

    "text": "Shimogamo is BAR-NONE my favorite Sushi place in the Valley.  It's not as inexpensive as some, but the quality of the sushi is truly impressive.  I've gone to every sushi place I can in the valley (I live on this side of town) and many places outside of Phoenix (Seattle & San Francisco being the most notable) and I'd place Shimogamo against ANY of them.  I'd recommend thier signature roll, as well as many of their sushi pieces, as I've had sushi there that I don't really like anywhere else (quail egg & uni).  Go there.  Try it.  It's a small intimate place with great service and even better sushi.  Reservations probably needed for the weekend and they even have a larger table in the back (a NICE back area) for larger groups.  If there were six stars I'd give them that.",

    "text": "I've heard it said that there's no such thing as good seafood in Arizona. While I can certainly understand the logic behind this reasoning, a worthy and notable exception has been found in Shimogamo.  Shimogamo has carried my personal label of \"Best Sushi in Arizona\" for well over a year now. I've tried plenty of other sushi restaurants, including a number that have been touted as \"the best\" by friends, but Shimogamo consistently wins out in my personal opinion.  The restaurant wins a five star review across all relevant categories of scoring, too: it's not just the food that's outstanding; it's the service, the consistent quality, the ambiance.  I could still recount every detail from the very first time I ever stepped foot in Shimogamo. I fact, it was Yelp that led me there! VERY rarely does ANY place make such a distinct and pleasurable impression.  Every time I've ever walked through the front door, I have been calmly and kindly greeted by the owner. He is quiet and polite and seems somewhat disaffected, but in a very gentlemanly sort of way. You can tell that he takes his business very seriously.  The interior is small but classy; quiet, but in a calming way. All surfaces are consistently pristine and dirty dishes are removed from your area almost as quickly as you can create them.  The sushi chefs are consistently cheerful and talkative, humorous and professional as well. Tonight I saw my favorite, Zach, as usual (I think he might live there), but also had the good fortune of meeting and being served by Josh, a four-day-young addition to the chef team.  As always, the food was superb. Josh was fun to talk to, very funny, and a very capable sushi chef as well. I'm sure he'll be around for a long time. Zach came over to make conversation occasionally, too. Point being: Shimogamo feels like home.  If there is one place that I am consistently EXCITED to tell people about and introduce friends to, it's Shimogamo. I honestly can't believe I haven't reviewed it sooner!  The food is somewhat pricey, but I have never been happier to fork over some $$$ for anything. Besides, they have a great Happy Hour menu for not-rich people like myself!  ;)  If you haven't been to Shimogamo, you need to check it out for yourself. If you HAVE been, I don't know why you've read this far, because you already know all this first-hand!  Well done, Shimogamo (Zach, Josh, and the rest of you)! Thank you for always being SO well worth the drive, the time, and the cost. Keep it up! And I'll keep sending new customers your way.",

They have many off-menu items that vary and you should give the fish head/cheeks a go they're spectacular. Best way to order is as a combo you really get a lot for the money considering the atmosphere and quality of ingredients.  Best to reserve in advance as the space is small. The best place to sit is in the back room. Another potential downside is that they do run out of menu items from time to time.",

    "text": "Okay, you ready for this one? My boyfriend...loves sushi! Me...let's just say I've had my issues with experiencing sushi but I wished I liked it because I know it is good for you and it looks amazing. So, of course being adventurous people we decide to branch out and try a new restaurant. When you pull into the parking lot it is tucked away in the corner so make sure you do not miss it. You walk in and you get this great small business feel to it. The best way to describe its ambiance is that it is a cozy, average-lit, clean, modernized sushi hole in the wall! Love it!  We were sat up at the sushi bar which probably holdds around 15-20 people max. (see picture) Along the wall there were around 5 small tables and in the back there is a private 'party' room. (See picture) We were automatically brought water, and served small plates with fresh wasabi and sliced ginger as well as given soy dipping dishes. we decided to order a cold sake and it was recommended by our waiter (good choice).  My boyfriend is the sushi expert and decides to just pick a few random things for us to share. We had the spicy tuna roll (the only one I did not try), the octopus, the eel, the yellowtail, sea urchin, spicy scallop hand roll and escolar. Let me tell you...wow!! The seafood was really very fresh. The escolar was my favorite or as the awesome sushi-ya (Zach) put it baby dolphin! LOL. I told him they should put that up on their specials board. Have it read: fresh flipper rolls! Oh, and by the way, they have live shrimp that you can eat after watching them prepare it to special standards! (see picture)  So, back to the quality of the food. The only comment my boyfriend really had was about their octopus. He was expalining to me the difference between good octopus and bad...it's the texture and firmness of it. The food looked beautiful and tasted very clean and elegant. I most definately seeing us coming back here again. Especially to talk more about baby dolphins being freshly clubbed daily with Zach! :) Thank you for making our evening very fun and very special! I will remember this sushi moment forever!",

    "text": "We ended up at Shimogamo trying to quench a sushi craving. We picked Shimogamo because of the Yelp reviews and it's proximity to us. I was not impressed at all...  We started off with the fried calamari. It looked great but tasted awful. It was sooo overcooked that I could barely bite in to some of the pieces and it also consisted of mostly tentacles. We ended up arriving at the end of happy hour so we ordered a few items off of the special happy hour list and some from the regular dinner menu. I appreciate that sushi rolls can take time to craft but it took an exorbitantly long amount of time to get from our appetizer to our rolls. And the restaurant was not overly packed.   After the rolls finally arrived they were average, very bland, and some of the rolls flavors seemed off. There was nothing about them that made me want to eat the next piece. As a result, we put our utensils down and requested the check.   Unfortunately Shimogamo left a bad taste in my mouth. This is the fourth sushi place I've been to since moving to Phoenix two months ago and it won't be on my go to list. There are much better establishments in the area - Roku in Scottsdale is amazing.  I would even rate How We Roll in Phoenix better than this place.   I was surprised on the way out of the restaurant when I realized there were two American guys rolling the sushi.   On another note ...   The atmosphere was nice. There are tables in the back that are more intimate and the waitress was very nice.",

    "text": "What a find in the back corner of a strip mall! This sushi place had great, fresh fish, some stellar tempura, and the overall ambiance is completely perfect for a date night. It's a cozy, dark nook next to a diverse array of other businesses. Service was super attentive and helpful. We got a chef's selection of nigiri, one of the specialty rolls, and mixed tempura plus sake and some Japanese beer. The nigiri was super tasty, my favorites the somewhat fatty yellowtail selection and the butter fish. Meanwhile, the specialty roll was also delicious and very well balanced. Now, I love tempura with a passion. This tempura was crispy, perfectly cooked, and not too heavy with a nice light dipping sauce. The only reason for four out of five stars overall is that we felt the price point was just a smidge high (for Chandler standards yet downright reasonable compared to Scottsdale prices) and the sushi rice needs just a bit more finesse to be truly outstanding. Overall, we had a great time here, the fish was great, and we'll be back for many a date night. Plus, can't wait to try to Wagyu beef options for the weekend specials!",

Our host, the waitress, and our sushi chef were polite and efficient.  The music I would classify as synthetic meh and the restaurant very small but the decor was pleasant.  The food was real and very tasty.  The Copper River Salmon nigiri was rich, dense, fresh and delicious.  Agadashi was served like a soup with a fried Serrano garnish.  We had a couple of the Happy Hour rolls -Shimogamo was fresh and had a surprising hint of lemon.  Crazy roll was wrapped with rice paper so it even presented very differently. The Eel & cucumber was also very nice. As a whole the food and service were very nice, but I think the prices were a bit above what I may have paid elsewhere.  Or maybe it's possible the prices really didn't seem to match well to the portions or cut of a couple of things.   It's was $70 for two of us, two beverages -not cocktails, two rolls, one nigiri, and agadashi.  Just seemed a bit steep, especially with two of the items being part of the happy hour savings.",

They shot him down and no they are \"too busy\" I have NEVER experienced a restaurant denying a customer. Especially one that will not come into the restaurant and take up a table and their wait staffs time. I'm so perplexed and bothered by this situation.

I got the rose and she got the iced green tea. The rose was light and fruity. The iced green tea was really good. I will be ordering that next time. It tastes like matcha water. It's not tea-like if that makes sense.   For an appetizer, we ordered the kara-age chicken. It is fried chicken pieces. The chicken is very lightly battered in an airy coating and then fried. I really didn't care for the sauce that it came with. I didn't dislike it but there were better options on the table to dip the chicken into. The tsunami roll came with a good sauce and the sushi chef made me a side bowl of it to dip my chicken in. It was a decent sized app for the cost. I would order this again.   For the rolls, we order three of them: tsunami, citrus, and Zen. The tsunami roll was my favorite. The roll was lightly battered and fried. The roll was slightly crunchy and not oily at all. The sauce it came with was miso based and it was amazing. I used the sauce on everything. I even got the recipe. For the citrus roll, the citrus flavor wasn't overpowering but also wasn't on the mild side. It went really nicely with the fish. The Zen roll compared to the other two was pretty soft in flavor, which was nice since there was already so much going on with the other two. The Zen roll had masago on top so that added a nice crunch and pop to the roll. The ingredients were fresh. We were there pretty late and had the opportunity to watch them prepare the fresh fish for the following day.  I would definitely come back here again.",

    "text": "Wow. What a sushi restaurant. I found another one that has high quality sushi. We went there for lunch and we were pretty satisfied with their sushi. Especially, the uni was super fresh and yammy. The sushi chef knows how to make sushi. It was very Japanese style sushi. The size of the sushi might be smaller than other place but the rice portion is also small which makes the sushi taste much better. Every sushi was really perfect that I can say this could be the best sushi in town. Although the chirasi that I ordered was not that impressive. The collection of sushi was nice and delicious but the rice underneath lacks the flavor. I will most likely go to this place to eat sushi. One downside is its high price. It is more expensive than most of our sushi places. Thumbs up!!",

    "text": "Visiting Arizona I figured that Sushi wouldn't be the easiest to find cuisine yet I was happy that Shimogamo fit the bill, as the other popping sushi joint nearby was AYCE and I didn't want attempt that feat.   When you walk in, the impression is the restaurant is very tidy and you feel at home because locals are at the bar joking with the chefs.   Of the dishes I tried, chicken karaage, rolls: zen, citrus, and tsunami, my favorite was the tsunami because the batter was lighter than the Vegas roll we were thinking of getting which would have been more fried. When in doubt, ask the Sushi chef!    I appreciated the sauces that accompanied each roll and the chef took time to explain the delicate process to yield such magical sauces.    My only (minor) complaint is I wish the menu had more pictures for us visual folks as it would have helped with choosing quicker.",

Lived in Tempe 4 years and are relieved to have FINALLY found our new sushi spot. It was PACKED.   Word to the wise: Make reservations! We were willing to wait, but we got seats pretty quickly, and gratefully before happy hour ended.   We ordered sushi (tuna and salmon) and rolls (spicy yellowtail, salmon skin, the shimogamo).  No. Regrets.   The slices of fish, and the way it's handled... are with obvious care and knowledge. Best sushi we have ever had. The salmon skin is truly fish bacon. The shimogamo roll has this perfect bit of citrus which gives it such a fresh taste.   We finished with having probably the best mochi, vanilla and green tea.   Definitely a gem. We will be visiting again, telling our friends, and looking for any excuse to visit again soon.",

Its seriously, just small tables that wrap around the sushi bar area and that's it. Can't be more than just a hand full of tables in there. But boy am I happy that I found this place so I don't have to go all the way to Scottsdale for quality sushi.    Must try the toro, wagyu beef, and fresh fish! Also, if you haven't had fresh wasabi, try that too. The portions are small, but the quality is high.  Service is relatively fast and friendly. You'll even see the owner hosting and serving. There aren't may workers, but there aren't may tables either so it doesn't take forever for you to find someone or to get your food.

I got the curry cause I was craving. We then ordered the waygu beef which was $10 per ounce. They were served on skewers along with a green onion and it was probably one of the best things I've ate.

    "text": "This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant! The seafood is so fresh and the flavors are impeccable! On this visit, we decided to order non-sushi items as well and were not disappointed. The steak tartare melts in your mouth and the grilled black snapper pairs perfectly with the creamy dill sauce.  Also, you cannot go wrong with any sushi roll here, our favorites are the vegas roll (best in the valley in my opinion) and the spicy yellowtail roll. I'm drooling just thinking about all of their delectable dishes!  The bacon wrapped scallops are also a must if they have them as a special!  Words of caution though, reservations are highly recommended as the owner will not allow you to wait if the restaurant is full.  He is unafraid to tell customers to \"go away.\"",

    "text": "Certainly one of the top sushi restaurants in the valley and getting better every day.  I've been to them all and Shimogamo, Yasu's, and Toyama are high above the rest of them.  Warm and inviting, this place is a classy well decorated and lit restaurant tucked into a strip mall.  Head sushi chef Zach has an appetite for bringing in interesting fish and items and is never allowing his customers to get board.  His efforts to bring in new and fresh fish are a reward for those of us who have eaten sushi all of our lives.  It is also a great place to go to early and get some great prices on beer and food.  $4 large Sapporo when many places try and get $8-$10.    A few things are a must if you come here.  The salmon skin rolls here is done 10X better than any place I have ever eaten at.  They make sure the skin is warm and crispy and loaded up.  The sweet shrimp are also a winner.  I spent most of my life not liking raw shrimp but Shimogamo has changed my mind.  I also love all of the crispy parts of the body that are cooked.  Oysters are always wonderful here as are the fresh scallops when they have them.  An absolute must is the Escolar with the Jalapeno.   I never ate Escolar prior and I would normally think that a Jalapeno would overpower such a mild fish but just GET IT.  They torch the fish to draw out some fats and the Jalapeno has wicked smoky flavor.  If you don't like it I can truly say you are strange!  :)  The toro the last few times is better than anything I have tasted in a decade.    The king salmon, fresh mackerel, and Uni are always fresh and perfect.     Everything we have had from the \"cooked\" kitchen is also very good so even if your friends do not eat sushi I would not hesitate to bring them along.    Be careful for lunch because they are only open on Friday I believe.  Reservations are a good idea unless you are there very early or late.  Music is always right on with nice ambient grooves from Thievery Corp and similar bands.    Lastly if you have a large private party for a special occasion they have a back room that can feel very private and classy.  We had a B-day there for 12 and it was perfect.",

That said, it is hands down my favorite sushi restaurant in the east valley due to food quality. You will not be disappointed with the food here. Freshest sushi around and rice done right. This is the kind of sushi you can skip the soy/sauces and enjoy the flavors on their own.  Shrimp tempura melts in your mouth.  Sushi chefs are friendly and always offer suggestions/make sure you are happy. The host can be a bit picky about seating/accommodating (when reservations take over the restaurant) so I've sadly had to find elsewhere to go last minute on a few occasions. I also wish they had daytime/more open hours as I find it difficult to schedule going there as often as I'd like to. If it were open during the day I would be there once a week for lunch.",

The ingredients are always very fresh and I love being able to watch the chef cut, mold, roll, and create the tasty little packages.  The offerings on their HH menu are pretty standard as far as HH sushi goes, but you can taste the quality.  They also have fresh wasabi available for those not faint of heart.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  You can tell a lot of intention went into the execution of the decor.  It's cozy but still a little edgy and you certainly wouldn't know you were in Chandler while sitting on the leather benches surrounded by metal, ball chain curtains in the back room.    Their specials, while not inexpensive (which would be suspect when it comes to sushi anyway) are delicious.  We tried the bacon wrapped scallops and, I mean, c'mon!  BACON wrapped scallops!  It seems like many reviewers compare any sushi here in the Valley to sushi they have eaten in places that are not land-locked deserts.  Look, your meal had to be plucked from an ocean (at closest several hundred miles away), packed, and flown here.  Seriously, People--that's comparing apples to oranges.    Shimogamo is definitely in my top 3 of Phoenix-area Sushi and I'm thrilled they are so close to home.",

    "text": "So my first visit to Shimogamo was back in 2005, I think, and I wasn't impressed with the place at the time so I never went back.  I remember having a really irritating visit because the sushi chefs were moving like sloths and our order came out super slowly even when there were just us and another table. Fast forward to now, we were on our way to try a new sushi place and when I read the review many of the reviewers complained of their slow service! So I turned to my hubby and said why don't we try Shimogamo again? It's been a while! That's how we ended up here on a Sunday night.  BTW, we'd already eaten our first dinner at 5pm at home and then we felt like sushi so this was our \"second dinner\" of the night.  What we ate: Agedashi Tofu: Two pieces of tofu and shishito pepper in clear broth. This little app cost $7. When you think two bites of tofu cost $7 it's pretty steep. Now, let me tell you that I didn't even look at the price when we ordered it, but I found out later via our receipt. Good thing for Shimogamo, this was a superb agedashi tofu!! Crispy on the outside and silky on the inside. Came out piping hot just how we like it and the extra spicy shishito pepper just made the dish. LOVEd this and $7 was well worth it!  Shima aji nigiri : $9. Fish was good but I've had better in other states and countries. The fact that they even have aji is pretty good though, because not many of the sushi places in AZ even carry this fish.  Assorted sashimi plate: $42. Pretty good thickness and nice sheen to the fish.  Oxtail roll: $16. This was their special of the night and it was delicious. I'm not sure about the truffle oil they drizzled on top which took away from the essence of oxtail IMHO. However, it was very enjoyable.  Overall, Shimogamo is better than 90% of the sushi resto in AZ as far as their fish quality goes. However, I don't think their price is justified. They are more expensive than many top sushi restaurants in Los Angeles and  San Francisco that I frequent.   We weren't even hungry so we ordered less than we normally do. Our total after tip was $105 and had we been hungry we probably would've easily spent $200. I certainly don't see this place as a $100pp restaurant.",

We ordered the fried oysters, salmon nigiri, a panko roll, a Shimogamo roll, and a tsunami roll. Everything was amazing. The oysters were perfect and crispy. The panko roll, which I was kind of skeptical about, was delicious. I can't explain the texture but it was perfect. The tsunami roll was our least favorite--my husband felt like there was too much tuna (I didn't, is there even such a thing?). I thought the sauce was too hot (Fire!) even though it was tasty. This was the freshest sushi I've ever had. The plates were beautiful--True art. We'll be back--infrequently because advance planning isn't our strong suit, but back none the less.  Original review:  I've been hearing great things about Shimogamo. I tried to make a reservation for a Saturday, saw nothing on Open Table before 8:00 for the entire month and mistakenly assumed we could get bar seats if we went early. We were turned away at the door--apparently there's no waiting. There are only eight tables in Shimogamo and if you want one, you should have a reservation, day or night.  I didn't want to wait a month for a weekend reservation, so we decided to go for a Friday lunch.   The interior is contemporary and lux--dark grays and blacks with flashes of silver. It's also tiny, tucked into a corner under the massive C U Gourmet. The service is brisk but efficient.   The lunch menu was pretty limited. There's teriyaki, curry, and bowls. There's also a sushi menu. My partner ordered the chicken katsu curry. It comes with miso, salad, and a potato salad. This chicken was well cooked and a nice portion. He likes his Japanese curry on the sweet side and wasn't a fan of this spicier sauce. All and all it was a good amount of food for the price ($14). I wanted to try the sushi as it is what Shimogamo is known for. I ordered a California roll ($5) and a shrimp tempura roll ($9) and added a small house salad and miso soup ($4.50). Unlike other Japanese lunch menus, there are no mix and match sushi or bento options. That makes a sushi lunch at Shimago a little pricey. Was the tempura roll (5 pieces) better than average, yes absolutely. So was the miso. Still not sure it was an $18 lunch.   We'll definitely come back to try the full dine menu. The small plates look too good to pass up. I have dietary restrictions right now so I couldn't do the sushi menu full justice. That said, I was a little disappointed with lunch after all the hype and getting turned away once.",

My Oahu homie Adam A. has spoken highly of this place and I've been meaning to pop in for years now but it wasn't until Jon H. suggested dinner here did I finally get to try this place. It was honestly so good that I set down my phone and forgot to take pictures of everything. What kind of Yelper has this place made me!?  A well-fed Yelper, that's what. I can't even begin to tell you all that we ate. We enjoyed White Truffle Amberjack, salmon sashimi, albacore tuna nigiri, yellowtail, pork cutlet, bbq beef tongue, fried kara-age chicken, tamago, a Shimogamo roll, spicy yellowtail roll, spicy tuna roll, et cetera. All this was washed down with two bottles of smooth Otokoyama Junmai. Everything was insanely fresh, delicately and uniformly cut, and delicious. Even the seasoning on their sushi rice was spot on. Also to note, their Happy Hour is worth perusing and taking advantage of. They also have fresh wasabi here, on top of that toothpaste stuff, so I'm ecstatic.  I definitely recommend Shimogamo for all your sushi needs.  Tip: Always call ahead for reservations. It's a small cozy place so seating fills up fast.",

I am surprised on the quality of the sashimi and the quality of the food.  This restaurant needs to be more exposed out there in Phoenix area for sushi.   In my opinion, Shimogamo is the best sushi restaurant in East Valley of Arizona and even in Las Vegas.     They do have happy hour menu specials and the prices could be at the high end but hey you are paying great quality of fish.  In my opinion, the restaurant setting is more for adult couples only. So parents, go ahead and hire that babysitter  I would recommend reservations for a bigger group accommodation.   The best thing about Shimogamo is the sushi chef does not fill you up on rice with their rolls. Also, their sashimi is clean and taste like butter.   Finally, I would recommend this restaurant but get ready to throw down that money.",

My boyfriend and I exclusively eat sashimi and sushi rolls so meals end up being very pricey, but worth every penny. We come here for birthdays and anniversaries and if we were rich, we'd visit every week!    They have daily specials which usually include nice cuts of tuna, yellowtail and others. They often have items not on their regular menu as specials, such as sea urchin. If you're not sure if you should try the specials, ask your waiter. But... the answer is yes. Just try it!   It's a small restaurant so reservations are required. Don't expect to get a table as a walk-in. I love this restaurant and will come here for my sushi fix as long as I live in Phoenix!",

The spicy yellowtail was our favorite, well seasoned and the freshness of the fish was obvious. I am not one to order a vegas roll usually, but we did and it was incredible. The shijoku oysters were the favorite of the night. The crazy roll was simple and flavorful. The rolls with panko shrimp were perfect as the shrimp was perfect and crispy.

    "text": "If I can give this place a zero star I would. The worst service ever in my entire dining experience. We showed up Friday night and they are semi busy. We were immediately seated. However, it took an unreasonably long time before a wait staff came by to get our drink order and it ended up being the \"host\". Then it took a while before the waitress came by and took our order. We were told that they are out of salmon. Ok no problem. We ordered some sushi. After quite a wait, we received 2 of our 4 items. It was ok, nothing exceptional. Then came the long wait. Finally the \"host\" came by and tells us that they are out of eel. Uh....shouldn't they know before we put in the order? However, he had no clue we had another order as well. We asked what about our other sushi order. He went checked, came back and told us they are out of snow crab also. So we said, ok then can we please have our check please since they have nothing to eat. The guy just disappeared and no where to be found. At the same time we never see our waitress again that night. After we waited, and waited, and waited, we finally saw him reemerge from the back. The entire time we didn't see any other wait staff in the front part of the restaurant. He's still completely oblivious. We had to waive him down and gave him the evil eye. He didn't even acknowledge us. And finally after he ducks in the back again he came back with the check. What a nightmare experience. Plus, we don't even really know how they foods are since they have absolutely nothing.... Will never ever go back again. Never had service this awful!",

Beef rib is good too.",

So we sat down and the guy suggested we go do something to kill time, so we did. We walked around Lee Lee's Oriental Market for a while. Well, before I left Shimogamo, the guy told me to give him my number and he will call me when a table is ready. Well, we got lucky and someone canceled their reservations so we got in. During our meal time, everyone was so polite. The food came to us in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered Tonkatsu and it was very delicious. I liked it. I will come back soon, but earlier this time haha",

    "text": "We wanted to try this place for so long, but what a disappointment it turned out to be! Maybe Monday evening is not the best time to get fresh ingredients from this place. Maybe it was not the right chef there at the moment. Maybe you get mediocre food when you \"take it out\". I have no idea what went wrong, but if the place is consistently good, these factors should not matter, especially when your bill is $88 for 2 (food only).  Where do we begin? The presentation. I will give them that, almost everything looked neat and appetizing. I know size of sushi maybe a problem for some people, but not for us. We like small pieces with thinly sliced fish. In our mind that is how sushi are supposed to be, not gigantic pieces of thick fish for the added value. There are 2 potential problems here and we had both: freshness of fish and the way their rice is prepared. It was too sticky, too mushy and seemed to be too salty. At least it was not pressed as they usually do at stores (and unfortunately at some restaurants, yuck!) Same applies to the rolls we ordered (btw when a customer insists on no cucumber for both rolls, you repeat it while talking an order, it is a huge disappointment to find cucumber in both rolls!). Real crab sushi was too salty for me, ok for my husband. He said Eel sushi was good.  Albacore Tuna Tataki salad - very fresh greens, nice sauce on a side, thank you for that, but not so fresh tasting albacore tuna! Could not finish it, put it aside after trying one piece. Same thing was with albacore tuna sushi. Lobster dynamite - a mess of a baked mayo with langostino tails on the bottom (Costco?). If we ignore a huge amount of baked mayo for a second, I  don't understand how you can replace a lobster with langostino tails without letting your customers know. There is a difference, it is not the same, and do not try to convince me otherwise! It is not ethical to call langostino a lobster, and it is not ethical to substitute one with another without letting your customers know (have no idea what was the case, but I suspect the first scenario) Also, please do not put slices of overripen avocado with tiny brown spots on a side - just skip it if you don't have a fresh one.  I do not get all these 5 star yelp reviews for this place. Besides, they do not even have half of the items pictured here from 2013. It is possible that the owner or chefs changed from those glorious times, but I am just speculating at this point. One positive thing Pan Fried Gyoza and Yakisoba were quite tasty, but these dishes are not the main reason I go to a sushi restaurant, fresh fish and properly cooked rice are.  My husband and I got severe stomach ache the night after eating this dinner. I usually can eat nails and while people around me feel as if they were poisoned, I either feel nothing or very little. This is the first time in a few years I got poisoned. Without this last fact or if we had eaten or drank something else besides this dinner, it would have been 2 stars. Since I woke up in the middle of the night with a stomach ache, it is just 1 star, sorry. In the evening I was willing to give them a second chance, but in the morning I do not feel so generous at all! Waste of our time, energy and money.",

    "text": "First off, get yourselves ready for some vulgarity. I have a LOT of great things to say about this restaurant, and absolutely zero tolerance for some of the douchepickles who have written reviews about it. That's right:  you're all a bunch of wanna-be foodies who need to keep your boojie ( <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.urbandictionary.com%2Fdefine.php%3Fterm%3Dboojie&s=fbc9669cb10fe2200ae327eb35bcbcabafd7290545c168bb8703febdc66acb77\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">urbandictionary.com/defi...</a> ) asses glued to the bars at Ra and Blue Wasabi. You don't deserve to eat at a place like this and no one wants to hear your opinions.  I absolutely love this place. I've been looking for this place for YEARS, and it just so happens to be in my backward. I've tried a BUNCH of sushi/Japan restaurants in the area, and I've always walked away disappointed. They're perfect for you types who love to tell your friends how edgy you are because you 'LUV SUSHI OMG LOL!\" but have never tried melt-in-your-mouth toro, explosive ikura, or FRESH scallops. Your expertise lies in the fields of California rolls, spicy tuna, and cream-cheese. I don't frequent these places because they don't have what I want (the aforementioned toro, ikura, and uni), and I'd been searching for a place where I could get my fix.   Came here with my girlfriend tonight and was a little wary... but hopeful. Saddled up to the sushi bar and looked over the menu. I should preface this review by mentioning how I even found this place:  I searched for 'uni' near Gilbert, and this was one of the first places that came up. I was fiending for some uni, and nothing less than perfection would do. So here we were, walking into a new sushi place, with high hopes that were just begging to be dashed upon the shores of disappointment beach. Hesitantly, I asked the itamae about the availability of uni. He just smiled and said:  \"Oh yeah, we have it tonight!\". Furrowing my brow, I imagined that he must simply be toying with my emotions. Casting an apprehensive eye back to the menu, I noticed that they had 'toro' listed. An inquiry as to it's availability was met with a big smile and a reply of \"Yes, we have toro, and it's great!\". A similar reply came when I asked about ikura. And so, we checked off a few boxes, ordered some carpaccio, and watched the man go to work. The first few morsels appeared:  sake, hamachi sashimi, and escolar. Now I'm not hugely familiar with escolar, and was wondering what was going on when my dude took a blowtorch to it. He was more than happy to explain:  escolar is a really fatty fish so we hit it with a bit of heat and throw one of our in-house roasted jalapeno slices on top. Now, I'm pretty puritanical when it comes to my sushi... but I have to say, this shit was RIGHT. The escolar was immaculate, and no less pleasing was the sashimi and salmon. Narrowing my eyes, I nodded thoughtfully as hope began to build within my weary soul. Our rolls were delivered, and were promptly consumed:  the shimogama roll was nicely presented with a great texture of crunch and mayo, but it was the salmon skin roll that really twisted my titty hairs. It was PERFECTLY crisped, with a delightful flavor that is HARD to find in salmon skin rolls (read my others sushi reviews- salmon skin rolls is one of my go-to items that I use to judge a prospective place). In short, the salmon skin roll was fucking mind-blowing. No sooner had we polished those rolls off then our next plate came:  toro and uni. I'm not going to lie to you... I was praying with every ounce of my soul for these pieces of sushi to suck sleepy ass so that I could continue my search and keep yearning for perfection... but then I'd be lying. I would be blatantly lying to your face, dear reader, if I told you right here and right now that it was anything less than spectacularific. The toro *LITERALLY* melted in my mouth- a few chews, a few swishes, and the meat had dissolved into a fatty delicious vapor which danced tantalizingly along my tongue. The uni was no less skeet-inducing. The good itamae showed us the package that it had come in, and was all-too-pleased to inform us that:  \"This box was shipped in today. It was probably picked out of the urchins earlier today. We have people who come in and buy entire boxes of this... I don't know how they afford it, but they do- they call in advance and order a whole box of this.\" After tasting it, I know that the man is worth every grain of rice in his nigiri. As I mentioned earlier, I was CRAVING uni, and Shimogamo knocked it out of the park. It was exactly what I was looking for. Then came my ikura (with a quail egg floating happily inside), and I ate it. I ate the shit out of that gunkan-maki, and I wanted to tap my girlfriend on the other side of her shoulder and steal the other out of her hand when she turned around. Because I'm devious like that and I care only for my own happiness. Yeah I said it.   Well shit. I'm out of space. Come eat at Shimogamo. Now.",

The sushi (spicy tuna, salmon, crazy roll) was excellent, and I noted how the rice was shorter and plumper than normal. Delicious.  The tofu dish we received was also excellent. A good balance of sweet and salty, with a nice soft center.  Interiors are nice, dim ambient lighting. The place is intimate with not many tables and seats.  I would definitely come back for my second meal.",

This leaves a little sour taste in our mouths as we recommend this place often to our friends.   The food is great and decently priced especially during happy hour, but beware, you may be turned away, so have a plan B.  We came back another day and it was closed. There was a paper sign stating that it was closed for the day (Jan. 24)",

It's got a cool contemporary vibe. It's small but not cramped. There is a back room for large parties. There were 2 guys manning the sushi bar and I have to say, I have never received my order to my table so fast! But it was not sloppily made, they were as nice and eye catching as any other sushi bar I've been to. The place was not dead either fairly busy for 6pm happy hour. I'd say these guys are very efficient in their work. We tried 3 rolls off the happy hour list. The Vegas, spicy yellowtail, and the crazy roll. All you could tell the fish was fresh and full of flavor. Yet these rolls were not heavy and super filling like some sushi places seem to make them. We also got the pork gyoza and the sushi escolar both were great! We definitely will be coming back!",

After a bit of thinking i remember this place. We came here durring happy hour which was great as they have some great prices especially for the quality.  The nigiri here is phenomenal we had both Escolar and Albacore both of which were amazing. Surprisingly the escolar was cooked (with hand held torch) but had amazing flavor and great texture (and i am not a big fan of cooked sushi).  We also had the Crazy roll (half off for happy hour), the big and spicy roll (still great), a negi-yellowtail (not chopped up like most places just shashimi cuts with scallion and wrapped), and i had a spicy tuna hand roll. All of it was great and the fish quality top notch.  We also had the house cold sake (too sweet for my taste but not bad).  The only downsides were the miso was again a bit cold (the tofu is not soaked in the the soup but tossed in cold). And also there was an odd smell that i am pretty sure is from the fish joint next door but not from here.  For the 2 of us with the sake it was $50 and worth it all. As for price it is about the same i expect for a dinner from Ra, Kona, Sakana, ect but the quality of fish is so much higher and the taste is way better.  Have to say Shimogamo is rapidly becoming my favorite sushi place in the valley",

Fresh cuts of fish, excellent service, great atmosphere & decoration in the restaurant.   This places has a certain level of authenticity that you simply don't find in Arizona (ie. don't look for it at Ra or Stingray). The sushi was crafted with care, the ingredients were of good quality, and they are inventive with certain rolls with out being ridiculous as you'll find with many places catering to more Americanized pallets.   Aside from your usual favorites, try the escolar nigiri and the izakaya style appetizers (sort of like Japanese tapas). I was impressed, and I thought the pricing was right (we paid about $32 + tip ea for two ordering 6 dishes total with beer). The value was definitely high.  I will definitely be going back.",

We got there around 5:15 and were the first and only party there until a couple arrived a little later...it's a small place, no more than 10 tables and a sushi bar, of course. The sushi guys were hispanic and talking in Spanish the whole time when they weren't checking to see how our sushi was or asking if we needed anything else...not too professional and made me wish we'd sat at a table instead.   So...started off with edamame...cant go wrong there, right? Uh, it was overcooked (believe it), and I felt as though it was a childs portion...  The baked oysters were absolutely amazing but they were served with a barbeque sauce....not a fan of the combo...but they were soooo good just by themselves so I managed.  The crazy roll, shrimp tempura, and eel & cucumber rolls were all on happy hour and all really fresh and yummy. Pretty standard though. I almost feel like I should go back and give them another chance but don't really wanna drop another $36 on it...",

With the lighting being kind of dim, the restaurant just gives you a good feeling before you eat your meal. It's a very cordial atmosphere. Prices are vary depending on what you order. I ordered the Tsunami Roll which is Tuna, Crab mix, Avocado, Cucumber, Fried with Citrus miso and Sriracha for 13.50$, and I can say that it didn't live up to the price. At least in my mind. On the other hand, dishes like a California Roll which is 5.00$, is just a classic and was very delicious. It really just depends on your opinion. The service is awesome. As soon as you sit down, you are greeted and given a menu. The tables all looked very clean as well as the silverware. Nothing to complain about, I was actually very pleased. I have eaten at many sushi restaurants, but Shimogamo was definitely a plus in my book! The atmosphere is very calm and casual and it's just a enjoyable place to dine. I think most of the experience is going to be the same. They are so consistent on the good service, and good food that it is really hard to give a negative review.",

I should have listened to that little voice in my head that said no, but my adventurous nature told me to try new places much louder.  I haven't had a good sushi experience here yet, after reading the reviews on Yelp I hoped this would be one.  I got the chirashi ($25), which is my go to dish.  You generally get a good variety of sashimi and can gauge a place's quality without ordering everything on the menu.  I have only one request with my chirashi (because its chef's choice you can't really pick and choose) but its very important and I am very specific about it.  Do not put mackerel in it.  I hate mackerel.  There are plenty of other choices that are similarly priced, so cost is not a valid argument.  I seriously hate mackerel.  Well guess what was staring up out of my bowl? You guessed it, a big ol' fat slab of disgusting mackerel.  I seriously had to stop myself from throwing it at the chef, because I really wanted to.  I wanted to go all Gordon Ramsay on the bastard.  What if I was allergic instead of just grossed out?! Seriously.  People do ask you to leave things out for those kinds of reasons as well.  That being said, the rest of my chirashi was pretty good, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have.  I was too irritated.  My husband was nearly done eating by the time they brought out my food, which didn't do much for my mood.  We ordered some nigiri and some rolls to try also.  The tamago was good but poorly constructed and fell apart on the way to my mouth.  The tuna roll was good.  The tempura shrimp roll had so much mayonnaise oozing out of it that there was no way I was going to touch that.  In fact, if I had seen that before I ordered dinner we wouldn't have ordered anything else.  Mayonnaise.  Ugh.  Another sushi fail on the books.  I won't be back.  They have all of my money they're going to get.  Sorry if I've insulted anyone, but tonight you deserve it.",

    "text": "Went to grab some sushi with Jared R. tonight.  He recommended this place from reading the reviews on here.  We started off with the miso soup which was pretty good.  Lots of Tofu and the broth had a nice flavor.  We both ordered some sake bombers to gulp down with our meal.    We got 5 rolls which were all really good.  The first set was the yellowfin roll and the fiery shrimp.  They both were really good.  The fiery shrimp was exactly as the name said.  It had just the perfect amount of kick and shrimp.    The next roll to come out was the Tsunami Roll which was my favorite.  It had a fried outside and lots of flavor.  The sauce that came on the plate was more than just a decoration.    Lastly we had the big and spicy roll and the spicy tuna roll.  They both had a great amount of kick.  The big and spicy was very good and the best part was the pickled jalapenos on the top.    Overall this place was really good and I would totally go back again.  Thanks again for another good find <a href=\"http://Yelp.com\">Yelp.com</a>",

The intersection has a high concentration of Asian businesses, so you know this is the real deal. It's a small-ish restaurant, and I am pretty sure they do have teppan tables, but I think everyone basically comes here for the sushi.  This is this east valley place for True sushi and nigiri. It is fresh. And high quality.   I suppose I could go on about all the different rolls and beautiful recipes and combos, but those all fall in line when the fish is fresh. So there you go.  Here's a tip though-this place has restaurant hours-you can't just drive here at 3pm thinking it's open. Make sure it it. And it's worth it.",

The tempura don was an accident; I ordered a tempura roll and the waitress brought me a tempura don. However, it looked delicious and tasted great so I didn't complain.  The staff was very nice. The servers made sure our waters were always full and we were always helped quickly.  I will definitely be back here.",

    "text": "My hubby and I have been searching for a real authentic Japanese restaurant in Arizona for long and got disappointed by so many that were rated 4 to 5 stars on Yelp.   The other day, I found Shimogamo from a Japanese community website in Arizona (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.japanese-in-arizona.com&s=45e725e9c1e225e2b5a57699914b3e90aa910be7eb7d8fb1df4066a1d6eb107b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">japanese-in-arizona.com</a>), and I thought it should be authentic and good enough to be posted on that website, so we went there for my birthday to give it a try!  AND FINALLY!!!!! A real authentic Japanese restaurant TwT!!! It's a rather small and unnoticeable restaurant sitting beside C-Fu, but the moment we got closer to the restaurant, we were already amazed by the beautiful interior of the restaurant! The owner (I guess) came to welcome us as we entered, and seated us at the sushi bar. The whole atmosphere was great, with the jazz and/or bossa nova music in the background, every staff smiling, I felt like going back to Japan again (we were surrounded by lots of Japanese diners in the restaurant too)!!  I ordered sushi pieces and my hubby ordered a grilled beef with herb sauce entree. From our experience that we had from other Japanese restaurants in the valley, entrees like grilled beef are usually very teriyaki like, the way I guess many non-asians are used to and prefer, but we were actually amazed and impressed by the beautiful and delicious grilled beef Shimogamo served!! The arrangement of the plate was a surprise:  some carefully sliced mushrooms put underneath, with grilled beef and some veggies on the top, served on a beautiful modern plate (see picture). It just looked so nice! And we were amazed again when we tasted it; the beef was so tender and the aroma of the herb sauce lingered around your mouth...*w*  The sushi I ordered were fresh and tender; the fish would just melt in your mouth (including uni and toro)!! I miss this feeling so much since I moved to Arizona last year and haven't been touched by eating any other Japanese food here. I also ordered a plum wine where its sweetness and light, lovely aroma made me feel soooo relaxed and happy *w*....  Definitely should go for a visit if you're a very picky diner and searching for authentic Japanese food like me! :D",

We will be back, but since the portions are small, that will double our bill since we would order double up on each item.  Shrimp Tempura was very light n crispy,,,,  Would have like to try the oysters, but either no longer carried or out of season ??   Cya next time..",

    "text": "Alright... before I start my personal review of this place, I'm going to comment some of the 1 star reviews I read.   I am myself a small restaurant owner and I truly think those are the best ones to start with - and the most interesting ones as well.  So here we go...  \"They refuse to take my to-go order because of the weather\" - well YES, this is arizona, it gets really hot outside and even more in your car. You're ordering sushis with raw fish; it's obviously dangerous to bring that home in a hot car! They want you to enjoy and appreciate their dishes right out of the kitchen/sushi bar- there's nothing wrong with that!  \"They refuse to take my to-go order because they were busy\" - it's better in my opinion to take care of your customers who are sitting in and waiting their food than rushing everybody and lower the quality. I understand the disappointment, I would be frustrated too but seriously, people, don't leave a 1 star review just because of that, without even trying the food!   \"We arrived at 5pm, the place was empty, they refuse to seat us because it's all booked\" - well YES, if tables and bar seats are reserved, they can't seat you! It's a tiny place with a very small amount of space and seatings. It's pretty common in France (yes I'm French) to be refused in restaurants on busy nights like Fridays or Saturdays if you didn't make reservation in avance. That's something very \"American\" - I want it, and I want it now.  How would you feel about your table being taken by someone else when you made a reservation?  \"Our bill was $$$ for the amount of food we got.\" - well- YES, this is the real deal. Real Japanese food. Not a \"sushis\" chain where you get big fat rolls and stuff to blow your mind. Everything is made at the order, they always have -very- special products that you can't find anywhere else. If you want fast and big sushis, there's other places or even the Fry's a block away with huge plates for cheap and low quality products.   \"They refused us because we had kids\" - well, To be fair, I don't think sushi is appropriate for young kids. They don't offer a kid menu for that reason, I guess.   From my prospective.  I repeating myself, this place is small and authentic.  We've been going there with my boyfriend every week for the last couple months.  First of, it's a walkable distance from our condo. Very convenient.  We get there usually on Monday nights for happy hour.  We've always got seats at the bar since Monday is probably a \"slow\" day.  Sushi chefs are friendly, recognize us and have the best suggestions//samples. Feeling special and recognized is very valuable for customers. I really enjoy it myself.  Happy hour menu is more than just decent, we mostly order from it and try something from regular menu too.  Service is cool, not exceptional - but once again, as a French girl, I don't like to be interrupted every two minutes by the waiter to check if I have enough ice in my water or if I need anything else. If so, I will make sure to catch somebody's attention.  Guy at the door - looks like he's the owner, isn't RUDE like I read in other reviews. He probably doesn't master English and is very shy. I know what I am talking about - I'm myself not very \"friendly\" at first just because of the language barrier.  And he is Japanese. He has different manners that we are not used to... very polite and discreet, doesn't talk or smile much.   We enjoy the atmosphere and our time when we go there.  Food is high quality, presentation is gorgeous in your plate, products fresh and selection right.  NEVER been disappointed.  So yeah, if you want to go to Shimogamo, you probably should make a reservation...  This is top notch Japanese food!",

    "text": "I've been trying to shrink my \"To-Do\"/\"Bookmark\" list on Yelp.  Shimogamo was on my list for quite some time and I was happy to stop by late last year!  I really wish that I had gone long before.  This is now my favorite place for sushi in the valley and I keep going back and forth between 4 and 5 stars.  Let's see by the end of the review where I'll leave it.  Shimogamo sits in a strip mall at the corner of Warner and Dobson Road, just barely inside of the Chandler city limits.  It share a wall and a door in that wall with a popular DimSum restaurant.  I have assumed that the 2 are sister companies because of the door.  Shimogamo is definitely a modern day sushi/Asian establishment with a modern feel to it.  It can appear kind of cold, but I guess when you're dealing with sushi, you need things to be cold.  Needless to say, I think that this place is fantastic.  One of the things that I like about Shimogamo is the fact that the quality of the sushi is stellar.  The fish that they use is incredibly fresh.  The sushi that I've tried is unique and creative.  My favorite roll is the Big and Spicy Roll.  It lives up to its name too!  While just spicy enough for me, the smokey oil marinated jalapeno's may be a bit much for others. Since size does matter, this big role is a perfect fit for my appetite!    I love to eat Black Cod cooked in Japanese restaurants....Amazing delicate and flaky.  Seasoned well and simply delicious!  Shimogamo did not disappoint.   The service is attentive and professional.  They have a large room in the back from a semi-private dining experience for large groups.  The best part about Shimogamo is I spend less money here than I do in other sushi establishments in the valley, but I have had a far better experience with respect to flavor, creativity and freshness!  I've decided given the quality of their sushi and the price... this is the best sushi in Phoenix.  If you disagree, send me a compliment with your suggestion.",

I didn't know what to expect at first, but I later realized that it doesn't matter your ethnicity,  any one can be a sushi chef.  I ordered my usual at any sushi restaurant,  the Chirashi. It was not bad. Definitely not worth  $29. I wish the sushi was more presentable,  for instance, standing tall in my bowl rather than laying flat on a bed of rice. Thicker slices would be nice. Way too pricey for Chirashi,  especially for how they serve it. The sushi rice was delicious. Not like what I've had before. The sushi chefs were very chatty and it seems a lot of regulars dine there. Not bad at all.",

I say this as someone who lived in Japan for five years (2004-2009) and just returned from a two week vacation to Japan. Everything on the menu is excellent as we have tried it all over the years. They will make some Japanese dishes that aren't on the menu if they have the items needed on hand (Okonomiyaki, Ramen, Hamachikama, black sesame ice cream, etc...). If you want to experience authentic Japanese food this is it. It is disappointing in a metro area of 4.5 million people there are no other authentic Japanese restaurants but it is what it is.",

    "text": "I love sushi. And not that trendy americanized sushi that seems so popular these days. I like fresh fish that's not drowning in sauce, which hides its flavor, that is True to Japanese style sushi. The vast majority of sushi places I have tried are americanized.   Not this place. I am so glad I read thru the reviews of this place and that it's only a few miles away from me now.  Tucked into the corner of a strip mall, sharing a bathroom with the C-Fu Gourmet, this place is very unassuming looking and simple. We were surprised to show up at 515pm on a Tuesday (they open at 5) and already most tables were filled.  The decor and ambiance was perfect. Music was a jazzy fusion feel and it was nice and dark colored with light accents.   We sat in the back room, feeling like mobsters doing a business deal. The center of this room has a huge family style table with a classy beaded drape that could be used as separaters.  On the wall was a classy sign showing their specials. When I asked our server about it, she explained, without prompting, which fish was freshest and how a couple specials are cooked. Just with that, this place got 5 stars from me and I hadn't even tried their food yet.  Side note for people with dietary restrictions: I have Celiac Disease and I am 100% gluten free so everything I ate or drank is gluten free. See the end of the review for my glowing gluten free/cross contamination review.  I ordered a plum wine that came in a beautiful little glass that forces you to enjoy the wine, not suck it down. In other words, you refill this tiny thing from a carafe that holds the full glass.   I also tried some of my husbands house sake he got with the expectation that it would be the normal bitter taste, like usual, and no. It wasn't bitter at all! It actually had a sweet ending! I was blown away.  We started with a nice fresh seaweed salad.  We ordered what was inherently gluten free, staying away from any imitation krab or breaded/fried items.  We ordered:   Alaska roll - snow crab was used and copper river salmon - smoky, awesome crab with a slightly citrus taste. Not jam packed with a ton of ingredients or sauce. SO AMAZING. Expensive but damn worth it.  Spicy salmon - smoky and spicy  Philly roll - strong cream cheese but good like that  Citrus roll - very good balance of acidity and spice with a fresh ending  Uni was super fresh and creamy. Uni is normally creamy, but this was the ULTIMATE creamy. I don't think I've ever had such fresh uni.  We ended the evening with green tea ice cream for myself and red bean for the hubs. Excellent as usual.  I have held off on writing this a couple days... I typically go to sushi with the expectation that I likely will get some sort of glutening due to how many places that use non-gluten free soy sauce in their sauce mixes.   I was never glutened at all. No reaction. This could mean 2 things: 1) they use gluten free soy in their mixes or 2) they don't use soy sauce at all in their sauce mixes. I'm betting on that they don't use soy sauce at all and leave it to you to add it when eating if you wish.   Add all that together... amazing food, amazing ambiance, not getting glutened... I would give this place 10 stars if I could.   Totally worth the cost. Go here if you love sushi.",

It was recommended that I make reservations, which I did.   They are only open one day of the week for lunch.   It is a nice atmosphere.   It is adjacent to a Chinese restaurant, which I've been to for dim sum.   I am not sure if the two restaurants are owned by the same owners, but the rest rooms are shared.  So that was different. ...  We both had the assorted sushi.   I asked to substitute the rolled tuna for the salmon roe nigiri, which they accommodated.  Thank you!   Of course, if I were to order the rolled tuna versus the salmon roe nigiri, the rolled tuna costs more.  If I remember correctly, the assorted sushi is eight pieces of nigiri.  It makes for a light lunch.   In fact, if I was starving, I would have still been hungry.   One of the fish had a bit of a fishy smell.   You know what that means!   And the salmon roe nigiri had the liquid of the roe on the dish when I lifted it from the serving platter.  GROSS!   I make salmon roe nigiri.   If there is liquid involved, it needs to be drained.    Our server was quite friendly, professional, and accommodating.   Unfortunately, I don't know her name since it is not on the check.  I wasn't in the mood to try any of the teriyaki nor the noodles or rice dishes.   If I was inclined to travel that far for sushi or Japanese food, I might go back.   Since there are good Japanese restaurants closer to me, I think I would be inclined to skip.   I debated whether to give it three or four stars but settled on the four since the atmosphere is good, the service is good, and even though I was disappointed with a couple of the nigiri, the rest of it was good.",

For a Japanese sushi chef, that's a big Nono.  Salmon tasted very average. Seaweed on the crab roll was soft... meaning it's either not fresh or has been sitting for awhile.  All in all, extremely average and rather poor service.  Again, some people might like the chatty chefs but I like how Japanese chefs never talk at the sushi bar for hygienic reason.",

    "text": "Right before moving back from Tokyo to the states, I lamented my future of never having good enough sushi at my disposal. Gladly I was wrong, and realized there are plenty of good sushi places....even in the middle of the desert....you just have to find it.   Shimagamo lies unseemly in old, almost hole in the wall plaza. However, when you enter you notice the stark contrast with tastefully simple yet elegant decoration. The place is fairly small, so bigger parties (bigger than 4) most likely need reservations.   The menu has more than sushi but we were there for the sushi. Between two, we ordered the sushi combo, unagi (eel), uni nigiri (sea urchin), otoro nigiri (fatty tuna) and a few items off the happy hour menu: sake (salmon), tamago (egg) and a roll. The unagi was meaty, exactly how I liked it. The uni was buttery and the otoro just melted on the tongue. For the sushi combo, I hardly ever expect to like octopus. I was, however, pleasantly surprised it was not chewy, but perfectly textured and delicious - exactly how it should be. My only gripe is the rice although good, did not hold well and was falling apart a bit.  Our bill for some of the more expensive items came out to about $40pp and left us happily full. Definitely one of the places I've tried in Phoenix for sushi, nice selection and fairly priced with excellent service. Would definitely return!",

I've been to other sushi places and it is warm and not cold like sushi is supposed to be, depending on the type of sushi you are eating. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The inside is small but very trendy and nice decor. Good place for a nice date or for a quick bite of sushi. I've tried just about everything on the menu and I can proudly say I've never been disappointed. Try for yourself, can't wait to hear your thoughts!",

The place is small and cozy and the owner was really sweet and kinda reminded me of the old man in Tokyo Ghoul which was pretty awesome. THIS IS LEGIT JAPANESE OWNED YALLS. So you already know it's gonna be bomb!   The food is definitely a 10/10. Their Las Vegas roll was so good and packed with amazing flavors on its own. I really appreciated how the roll had a crunch to it on every bite which is a big plus for me. And their Nigiri (omg) It was so buttery and creamy and just straight up delicious. You can really taste the freshness and tell how well they handle the fish with such care. Their Eel (omfg) made me want to dance it was so good! Literally right when it touches your mouth, it MELTS! All the goodness that makes it like an orgy in your mouth. Yum. To top everything off, and this was my favorite, THE MISO SOUP! I'm a big fan of soups so this was definitely a home run. The first sip of the soup that I had felt like it cleansed my soul. The genuine authenticity that you taste from the richness of the broth, the softness of the tofu and the saltiness from the sea weed just warms your whole body and heart together in perfect harmony.   Thank you SO much Shimogamo for such an amazing experience with your delicious food. Will most definitely be coming back VERY soon and very often!",

I've only dined at Shimogamo twice, but the quality and presentation of their food was so awesome that it left a lasting impression on me. Apparently, many other people felt the same way because it was packed on a Tuesday night that I came!  The rolls and sashimi are excellent and even the kitchen foods are great. Honestly, I would recommend everything on the menu if it fits your fancy. I personally like to stick to rolls and sashimi and then finish off my meal with a bowl of their porridge (which is really ochazuke, for those who know what it is).   I highly recommend Shimogamo. I picked it as my last meal in Arizona, if that says anything about how awesome it is!",

Very nice.  6 thin slices of baby yellow tail.  Looked good, tasted good.  Temperature of the fish was just below room temperature (as far as I could tell).  So it was not cold and not warm.  Also order some sashimi.  Small pieces at a large price.",

For my kid I always order a lobster roll here they did a fantastic job the meat was tender and moist the sauce was creamy but not over done. We also tried a few specials like the amber jack with truffle sauce WOW and the red snapper in a lemon garlic sauce was to die for. Every time I come to visit family this will be my go to place. Oh I almost forgot our server was Max he was friendly attentive and made great recommendation. Also had some albacore with a drizzle of ponzu sauce melted in my mouth.",

The prices on the \"Happy Hour\" menu on their website are incorrect.  I paid $6.50 instead of the listed $5.50 for my chicken.  The only item I tried was 4.5-star-worthy, and that was the \"Japanese Fried Chicken.\"  Lightly breaded and yummily juicy white meat. Very tasty.  Small portion for $7.09 though - only about 7 or 8 small bite-sized pieces.  The taste made me wish even more that they had not been out of oysters.  But as others have noted, the \"price to value\" equation here is on the pricey side.  P.S. It has been pointed out to me by a helpful Yelper that oysters are \"not in season\" in August, and that's why they were not serving them.  That's fine, but I would say to a restaurant owner that if you have something on your menu that is available only in certain months, then you should say that on the menu.  *oysters available only in etc etc etc.  That way, people won't drive over there to get something which is out of season.",

We sat at the bar at this occasion. It's probably one of the few Japanese restaurants/sushi bars that is owned by fa Japanese family. I feel like most other ones are owned by Koreans. (could be a huge generalization but it's True in many cases).   Anyways, the service is good. There were two servers and the owner was helping out as well. Two sushi chefs at the bar who look like they just graduated from high school, but they knew how to cut fish. Thumbs up. I liked the appetizers as we started off on miso soup and seaweed salad. The sushi portions are on the smaller side (6 rolls), but I think the quality is great. The nigiris were awesome and even the rolls tasted really great. They don't go overboard on sauces, so you can taste the different flavors of the fish and ingredients in it. This may not matter to you as long as it taste good overall. Also had the fried icecream which were bomb. I don't know how they make these, but I approve.   Great restaurant to try out if you are into sushi!",

The Citrus Roll is amazing - so unique!  The spicy salmon and spicy yellowtail were also very good.  If you like a lot of heat, you'll love the spicy Vegas roll - it is topped with a jalepeno slice.  We had the spicy dumplings for an appetizer and they were also very good.    The only reason I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars is that the service on our second round order of rolls took a really long time - to the point we thought they forgot about us.  This was surprising because the first round was brought out in a very timely manner.  The wine list is not extensive but the Merlot we chose was a nice one.  A co-worker ordered the Chardonnay and said it was also really good.  Overall, if I'm back in Chandler I will definitely go to this restaurant again.  The sushi was excellent!",

My favorite  thing was the mochi ice-cream!! I had the strawberry! The mochi was a perfect texture and thickness!! The servers were very nice, and friendly. My husband and I were seated in the back room, away from the main room, and it was nice and quiet and relaxing! I want to go back and try some sushi rolls soon!",

This place definitely deserves every good review it has (meaning it's not one of those over-hyped places where you leave disappointed)!! Service is fast and friendly. It's a small place with cozy decorations, perfect for gatherings!",

I ordered the Chirashi bowl for $25 and it was incredibly filling. It was full of delicious slices of fish. You pay for what you get here and it is all incredibly tasty and high quality. The restaurant is cute and usually packed. Reservations are highly encouraged. They have a cute table in the back for larger parties as well.",

    "text": "For my first visit here, I'm only giving this place 3 stars. This is a small little sushi place, so not really a place for large groups, but great for small intimate groups. My only concern, either way, is that it's not very private in the conversation department. It's that small....A little background music would have made this perfect--but this place did not deliver.  Service was ok, i suppose. Our orders were simple, and we had water to drink, so not much to do--plus there were only two of us. The only saving grace was this: i wasn't so hungry i was about to gnaw my arm off (it took forever to get our food and we ordered 2 *simple* rolls a piece) and that i had great company filled with entertaining conversation. If those two things not had been factors in this dinner equation, this could have been much worse.  I will say, however, the sushi was pretty good. Fresh fish, unique combinations, and it kept well for take out. I had to bring dinner home for someone and got the thumbs up from them. Seeing as how it was over an hour before i showed up with it after they brought it to me, that's a good sign, lol.  I will definitely go back if given the chance, but it's not a place that is high on my radar. If the atmosphere was better i might feel differently.",

    "text": "Let me start with the good.  Their fish seemed fresh, and they have some interesting, well conceived rolls.  Their Scallop Nigiri was fantastic, fresh, and delicious.  Outside of the scallops, their food was 'Meh'.  Had Yakisoba, and several rolls; did not try any of their sashimi, because it seemed really expensive (4 pc. Sake Sashimi for $9).  We quickly realized why the rolls were cheaper: because there isn't much fish in them.  The fish on the rainbow roll we got  was sliced so thin, it was hard to tell how quality the fish was.  The rice to fish ratio was ridiculous, leaving with me mostly full, but unsatisfied.  We were warned before ordering that they were pretty busy, and we should put our sushi order in quickly.  While I appreciate the warning, I don't think AN HOUR AND A HALF is an acceptable waiting time with or without warning.  The Yakisoba we ordered came out promptly, but after finishing it, we waited another full hour for the sushi.  Overall I feel they are overpriced for what you get, and the food is not exactly worth the wait.  Not bad by any means, but not worth dealing with the price/service.",

The service was excellent and the menu was pretty expansive for such a small place.   Because I'm pregnant, I'm trying to limit my exposure to raw fish so I ordered the chicken teriyaki platter. It came with rice, soup, salad, and a full breast of teriyaki chicken. Unfortunately, my food arrived cold. I was disappointed but sucked it up so as not to embarrass our hosts. For this, I lowered my rating one star. Cold food is a pet peeve of mine.    My son and our hosts enjoyed the sushi and kept noting its freshness and great flavor. Hubby enjoyed the teriyaki ribs and his meal was served hot hot hot. Not sure what happened with mine, but oh well.   I'm looking forward to going back after my pregnancy so I can try out the sushi and hopefully the hot food will be hot.",
