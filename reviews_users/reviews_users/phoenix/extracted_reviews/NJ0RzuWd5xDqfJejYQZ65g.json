The place doesn't fill up until after noon.  Service is decent.  They have a nice patio area too so in the cooler times of the year it's a great place to sit.   One thing I will say is the smell when you walk in seems clinical.  I don't know what kind of cleaner they are using, but it smells like a hospital ward.  Maybe it's because we got there early, but still the smell lingers and its actually not very appetizing.    Overall, it's a great place to grab lunch or dinner.",

I type in Delux and see it's only 12 mins away so I head on over. Man was I glad I chose this spot. I pulled up and saw the restaurant was quite busy so already I was feeling good about my decision. I decided to sit at the bar since it was open seating. The bartender (who I'm bummed I can't remember her name) despite being pretty busy still managed to take care of me in timely fashion. When I told her it was my first time she quickly gave me the rundown about the type of product they sold. I decided on the Delux Burger and an order of mixed fries, alongside my  Ballast Point Sculpin beer. My burger came out in a promptly fashion and from the first glance at it I was impressed. My first bite was out of this world! I was told to try the aioli that came with it and it made it even better. I was definitely impressed by both the food and service so I will definitely be going back when the late night hunger hits.",

    "text": "Oh Boy. This could be grounds for divorce as my husband loves Delux, but I just can't give it more than three stars. Why? INCONSISTENCY. Don't get me wrong, I've had 5-star nights at Delux but I've also had 2-star nights so here I stand.  The beer selection is fantastic, the wine list is okay and  the menu is simple and what you'd expect from a burger joint - burgers, a hot dog, salads and few apps but there's just something missing for me. The service is okay. I don't think we've ever had exceptional service at Delux. It's always \"okay\" or \"good.\" I like the community table (although I wish the seats were more comfortable) and the outside patio is good when the weather is nice (if you can get over the fact that everything in Phoenix is in a strip-mall and you have views of the Safeway parking lot).  Overall, if I'm going to spend $60-$100 for a beer, wine & burger night with my husband - I want it to be spot on and unfortunately, you just can't count on Delux for delivering that all the time.   If you're in the area looking for a burger joint with a good vibe check out Zin Burger at the Biltmore Mall.",

Then we had the turkey burger and Chicken salad and yet again, we were in taste bud heaven and positive we'd go straight to hell for such yummy pleasures!

I wanted a barbecue burger, but they didn't even offer one...  Instead, they offered two beef burgers and one turkey burger.   I chose the Delux burger (I figured since they named the restaurant after it, it must be good), and it didn't even have any seasoning. It was bland, and tasted more like meat loaf than a burger.   The only redeeming qualities of this place were the fries and the decor. I didn't even like the dipping sauce that came with the fries that much. Very expensive for what you get.",

The waitress said I should definitely do with the turkey burger, it was by far the most disgusting turkey burger I have ever had in my life. It was chewy and just tasted awful. I would have sent it back but our waitress never returned to check on us after we got our food to ensure we liked or food or needed anything. She arrived back at the table after the group had finished eating I had over half my burger left and she didn't even notice. I will never return. I always order turkey burgers, a frozen jennie-o cooked at home tastes better then this crap served to me. The fries were nothing special and I know my friend who ordered the deluxe burger was not impressed either. Awful food and awful service, don't know why this place is popular.",

But I felt like there was not enough beefy flavor to it.  Maybe the caramelized onions and applewood bacon took that away?? Not to mention the fancy arugula green leaves.  The final piece to this atypical style was that it came in a demi-baguette roll.  All of these supporting cast ingredients to the patty tasted fine and complemented each other but overall the final product steered away from the American classic style.  The only thing I remotely liked about the fries were that it was lightly seasoned with salt and little herbs and the fact that it came out in a little shopping cart with the Delux logo in front of it.  I would rate them as mediocre.  It just did not pop.  I was hoping for the potato fresh taste in the inside and crispiness on the out.

Now that the 2go side of the restaurant is also seating there are more servers walking around and going behind the take out counter. On a semi-busy Friday evening I walked inside and over to the counter but no one was there... not a big deal, I'll wait. Most tables was occupied with diners so I was just sort of hanging out with nowhere to sit, smelling the food and craving mine. Two different servers walked though the doorway from the main restaurant into the 2go area -zooming right passed me to their tables without even looking in my direction.. and then back out again. I thought I could at least get a smile, a 'how are you?', a \"someone will be with you shortly\" Nothing! Then, a server walked behind the counter where I was waiting and started ringing up something on a register. He was looking down or passed me the entire time, avoided eye contact completely. It was so uncomfortable!!! I am literally standing a foot away from his face and he says nothing and will not look at me... I was so close to greeting HIM and asking why he was avoiding me but I held back. It was super strange and I really wish I would have said something instead of just writing about it.. but hey. By the way when the young man who was working the take out counter finally came over he was nice and helpful... But seriously Delux.. Say Hello to people! I understand you are not making any money off me by saying hi or looking in my direction but a little customer service is always appreciated.

The meat was prepared just about right and the burger was the right amount for the price but honestly I've had better.  The soup like a crushed bowl of salsa with a nice kick to it.

They recommend you order it medium rare, and I decided that the reason they do this is to thoroughly soak the massive loaf of bread they call a bun in order to make it edible. The completely inocuous side of shredded beets and carrots is just confusing. And at 9.5 bucks, its just not doin it for me anymore.   This burger is just missing something, and all it really does is make me long for a delicious Father's Office burger.   Sorry Delux (and any fellow Yelpers whose sensibilities I've offended with my flip flopping) but I won't be headed back anytime soon....",

I ordered the Delux burger, but I'm not a fan of bleu cheese so they were able to substitute it for me.  The only bummer was it was a bleu cheese and gruyere mix and I would have loved to still have the gruyere.  So good, but a little messy!  We also had a basket each of the regular and sweet potato fries.  Yum!    It's busy during lunch time, so try and get there early if you have a bigger group.  The service was very good.  I really can't say anything which hasn't been said already.  I'll definitely be back here again.",

    "text": "I was so completely ready to love Delux. I had been waiting to try it for a reaaaaally lonnnng time, and was excited to make the little trek down Camelback and give it a go. Pre-review context: it was a Friday night, and it was very busy.   My boyfriend and I rolled up into the strip mall parking lot, and spent a solid 5 minutes hunting for a space. And not just, you know, driving around looking for one. I mean competitive space hunting. Horns were honked. I became a little afraid. An ulcer was formed. After finding a spot some distance away, we walked up and in to the trendy, blue darkness of the restaurant.   The whole place was almost completely full, including the outside patio area, (which is where I really would've liked to sit - October, you are finally HERE!). But I wasn't mad at 'em. Good for them. A frosty hostess seated us at the bar-style table in the center of the restaurant, and stalked away. I think we interrupted her composition of a text message. Whatever, lady!   The table we sat at is probably exactly the place I would've LEAST liked to sit. While it is, you know, \"cool,\" and lit from beneath by fluorescent blue lights, I felt very cramped in between the parties to our left and right. They weren't being loud, or obnoxious, and I even felt they were being conservative with their elbows. All the same, it was not a comfortable fit. Plus, my man and I prefer to sit next to each other when we go out. I know...I know. We also like to converse during dinner, and, since we could barely hear one another over the din, this would probably be the kind of place I'd go with a group of tipsy friends rather than on a date night.   In contrast to the disgruntled hostess, our server was very sweet and pleasant. She was friendly and patient with us as we made our drink decisions, and also remained unobtrusively attentive for our meal. My boyfriend was excited to see that they had Sierra Nevada on draft; I ordered a French Vanilla martini, which I chumped out on and couldn't finish. This, from a girl who used to order three Long Islands at once...I think my heart cracked a little, to witness myself so far removed from my former glory.   We shared an order of mixed fries, \"a la carte...\" CART, get it? Get it? Very cute presentation, but I think I would've been more tickled if I didn't know it was coming.   Know this: I am a sweet potato fry maniac. In fact, Delux's sweet potato fries were really the big reason I wanted to give it a go. I had anticipated them for months! ...and they were just, okay. In fact, both varieties of fries were \"just, okay,\" and I also didn't really see any reason to rant and rave and Yelp about the ketchup or the aioli, the latter which I feel I make a better version of at home. So, yes. I was happy to munch on some sweet potato fries, but it's not like wings sprouted from my back or anything upon touching the first golden fry to my lips. My boyfriend said they were \"fine,\" which is his stock answer for assessing the quality of anything that isn't a beer or an action movie.   My boyfriend got some random burger, and I had the turkey burger. I agree with the several reviewers that have whined for \"more seasoning, please!\" on the turkey burger. Let's face it - the noble turkey is one bland-ass bird. It requires a heavy hand, a smackdown of spices and seasonings. My turkey burger seemed to get something more akin to a pat on the head, although I did still enjoy it, especially with the creamy sauce that came alongside. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger, but prefers the Original Hamburger Works. Oh, well. Apparently the fancy presentation, (\"what is this stuff?\", was his response to the julienned carrot garnish), wasn't enough to compete with the sheer grunge of OHW.   It was easy to pay our bill and leave. I know people complain about this sometimes - you will not have to complain here.   We will probably go back. I'd like to try one of the \"real\" burgers, and my boyfriend has mentioned the great beer selection several times since our visit. It wasn't a bad experience...it just wasn't all that and a cart of fries.",

This includes burgers.  I had heard a lot of hype about Delux, and thought that I ought to give it a try to see if it could hold up to my dad's famous Gerrick Burger - ingredients are secret!  I ordered the Delux burger, lured in by the maytag and gruyere, as there can't possibly be two better cheeses on the planet. And when you add bacon and caramelized onions, you've snagged me.  The burger was good. Well, really to be more accurate, it was above average. It didn't blow my socks off, or make my mouth water for a second.    The Sweet Potato Fries were delightful, as was the aioli they were served with.  Will I ever go back? Sure. Will I be the one to suggest a visit there? Probably not.",

I always get the Chinese chicken salad, but I have tried the caprese salad and the beet salad a few times and I am very happy with all of them. I also really like the turkey burger, it's so juicy! And my favorite drink is a welled mannered martini, some places don't have blue cheese stuffed olives but they do :) and the to go side is genius, I order from there a lot too at night if it is too busy, which it does get a bit crowded in there later in the evening, being that it is kind of a smaller place. It sucks that zen 32 is gone because they used to carry some of their sushi on the to go side but I guess it looks like I'll have to give revo burrito a shot. I've been meaning to do so but I some how keep getting sucked into Delux :) oh and PS you can't pass up the sweet potato fries. Nom Nom Nom Nom! ;)",

Apparently this concept is lost in the valley of the sun other than Delux.  They are open until 2am and serve burgers and sushi as well as drinks.  I know what you are thinking burgers and sushi?  Let me tell you the sushi is very decent and I am extremely critical of sushi in Phoenix and Scottsdale.  Its fresh and tasty...what else do you need at 1am when the streets are barren and everything is closed.  Thank god for Delux.",

Lots of beers on tap, Mothership - really close to a Hoegarden was my fave! They also have what they call \"Flights\" where you get a board of three different beers shooter style to try. Next time if I am feeling feisty I will trying them out.   I ordered the Turkey Burger, very good. It has lots of flavor. And sadly I had to admit that their wheat bun is a bit better than the one I get at the burger place that shall remain nameless.   Over all the place is a go. Nice ambiance, a tv to watch the game, great plate presentation, good sized patio out front (patio is key in AZ!). One thing I will say negatively.... bar stools - not comfortable at all.",

    "text": "Delux is a definate staple in the Phoenix food scene.  This is one of the better establishments in the Phoenix area.  If it is your first time heading to Delux, I would start with the Delux Burger itself.  This is a very good burger that is best served the exact way that it is spelled out on the menu...including the medium rare serving temperature.  Trust me, I am a medium temperature on my burgers (the only thing that is not red), but the juices that flow through this burger are unbelievable.  Start the table off with a basket of mixed fries (sweet potato and regular fries) for every 2/3 people there.  Well 2/3 hungry mid-20s men.  If you want to venture away from the burgers on the menu, I suggest getting the grilled cheese and adding chicken and bacon to it.  The chicken sandwich is pretty good, but the grilled cheese is better.  The restaurant is definitely cool inside, and the patio is nice.  This restaurant is busy, but never seems to be longer than a 20 minute wait time.  The bar is cool, and a great place to grab a few beers.  They always have something new and exciting on tap, so ask for a draft list and enjoy something cool and refreshing.",

Luckily, this place is open until 2am, every day!  And, luckily, it reminds me of the movie Tron, which I love, inside, with neon blue lights all up in your face!  Between the bf and I, we ordered the delux Burger and the Standard Classic Burger.  If you tell them you want it cooked medium-rare, they actually know what that means!  Pink and tender on the inside, light brown on the outside, and soooo yummy.  We also shared a beer flight, which was pretty cool, and some \"a la cart\" fries, which are presented to you in a mini shopping cart.  Convenient, cute, kitschy, yummy, along with a side of good service.  I recommend!",

    "text": "Passing through the Biltmore area, we were in the mood for some good quality burgers, and thought, we'd give Delux a try!  Was it worth it?  Location & Aesthetics - located off East Camelback Road, on the corner of N 32nd. Street and E Camelback, in the Biltmore area/section of Phoenix, and in the same compound with Safeway grocery.  Lots of available parking that's separate from Safeway's parking area.  This particular area does have a couple other restaurants so you may have to drive around (within the parking lot) to find a parking spot which isn't totally inconvenient in my opinion. The interior decor is nice though, I thought, a bit on the small side.  There is outdoor seating, and I believe there was a heating lamp outside for those chilly evenings.  At the time we went, it was around 3:00 PM and the place wasn't too busy on one side. I say \"one side\" as apparently there's two sides to the restaurant -- side with the bar and, if I'm not mistaken, the side that served the burgers; and the other side, I believe, was for the sushi though I could be wrong on this assessment. We were seated on the side for the burgers (for the purpose of this review) as that's why we were there.  There was seating with high chairs that seemed appropriate for couples or just two folks grabbing a bite to eat; and seating with tables, chairs, and booth-styled (though not entirely) seating against the wall.  As I was in a party of three, our greeter was kind enough to join a table together for us.  As I mentioned before, the interior did seem on the small side (-1).  If a medium-to-large sized group came in, I'm not sure how they'll finagle the seating to accommodate.  Lighting was ample with enough light from outside streaming in through the front windows.  There were TV's on the walls but appeared muted.  Noise level wasn't bad.  Dress is casual.  Menus - were quickly brought to our tables, and we were quickly acknowledged by waitstaff!  The drinks menu was quick extensive as well as the dining menu, which were both comprehensible to read and understand.  Waitstaff was happy to answer any questions we had on either menus.          Service - very prompt!  Drinks were brought to our tables, followed by a small wait, then our food.  Waitress visited our table frequently to see if we had any issues, concerns, or complaints, and always appeared with a warm pleasant smile.   Even as we entered, the greeter gave a warm welcome and was prompt to acknowledge us we walked in, asking whether we wished to dine outside or inside, and provided us with options of tables as there were three of us.  Wait time for the food wasn't bad considering one in the party ordered the Delux burger cooked well, and I wanted mine cooked medium-to-well.    Food - I had their signature Delux burger -- premium beef with the Niman Ranch signature seal, their signature infusion of caramelized onions, bits of applewood smoked bacon, blend of gruyere and maytag bleu cheeses, and topped with baby arugula.  All of this is served on a handcrafted demi-baguette!   If you don't know much about beef or products from Niman ranch, I highly encourage you to research it on the web to discover more about their mission. The burger, once presented to you, doesn't look round like your usual burger, but instead, looks similar to grinder sandwich. One phrase to sum up the experience of eating this burger -- it is to die for, and out of this world (okay two phrases).  The burger tasted great -- really fresh; cooked to perfection and as I had asked -- well done; juicy; and really well seasoned.  It certainly didn't taste like your ordinary ground chuck you pick up from the supermarket.  The buns were freshly baked, warm, and soft.  The smoked bacon added that extra bit of smokiness to it; the caramelized onions a bit of sweetness; the cheeses gave it a slight bit of acidity; plus the arugula seasoning, though unusual and never thought could be used on a burger, was a great surprise that provided a slight peppery flavor to the whole burger. For my drink I ordered their Haagen-Dazs vanilla shake which comes with whipped cream and a cherry on top.  Let me tell you, this shake isn't your regular shake and probably that's because it's made with Haagen-Dazs ice-cream -- it made it very authentic tasting....the real deal!  It was super creamy, rich, and thick, and was served with two straws in case you wished to share (yeah, right).  What I particularly liked is that, even though it's served in a traditional milkshake glass, they will bring a metal cup and spoon with the remainder of the shake for you.  In other words, the remaining portion of the shake isn't wasted!      Despite the time we arrived was still 3 PM, they were still serving the lunch menu which entitled you fries with your burger.  I ended up choosing my usual favorite -- sweet potato fries.  The portion size was adequate, and were fresh, warm/hot, and not soggy or limp, but actually very crispy.  A definite must return!",

The parking lot was a bit tough to navigate since it's a busy spot and finding an open spot took a few minutes, but we ended up close-by.  We headed on in, and the place was on the smaller side, but we were seated right away inside at a two person table.    Our server was Mario and he was really helpful in walking us through any questions we had about the menu or options. The space itself felt crowded despite it not being full of people since there are tons of seats, decor, staff, bar space taking up every nook and cranny. But the fun ambiance and all the things to look at are fun at the same time.  We both opted for the Delux Burger and decided to share an order of fries. We hesitated to see that the burgers were roughly $12 and didn't come with any sides, but once we got our plates, it made a lot more sense. The burgers are gigantic and there are two of them on the plate! The fries come in an adorable \"shopping cart\" and they were cooked perfectly.    They had dessert options, but we were pretty full and decided against it, but will know better for next time!  Overall: A Definitely a winner among the various burger bars in the area!",

    "text": "(Lyrics - Ice Cube - Today Was a Good Day)  Just walking to Delux gotta thank god I didn't know they serve sushi that's kinda odd No parking from streets, no prob And they're cooking up some burgers with plenty of hogs (or bacon!) I got my grub on, but didn't pig out  Finally got a some yam fries that I wanna try out Hooked it up for later as I hit the shots Thinking will I live it up, for another happy hour Don't wanna go cause I had me some beer flights  And if I hit the streets, I can get a DUI Had to stop to get another bite Looking in my mirror and was redder than a beet But everythings alright  I got a mini burger, and it's for happy hour all night Called up the yelpers and I'm reviewing y'all Which soup, do you want to try out at all? Get me in Delux and that's no trouble Last week Yelped around and got a duo burger Ketchup and chipotle sauce all the way You gotta believe today was a Delux Day  A Delux day all day everyday!  Yes, Delux is staple burger joint of Phoenix for some times now and now serving Sushi!  Located next to the Biltmore area, Delux burger is known to have a great happy hour and late night eats.    The place is always popping when I attend.  The blue lighting totally weird me out, but it's alright.  I've never came here for breakfast or lunch; needless to say I'm sure it's pretty damn good cause I know the late night menu is awesome.  Craft beer and flights is a must and your fries come in a mini shopping cart!  Don't understand the concept behind it, but it's a whole lot of fries I tell you that much; generally served with a side of ketchup or chipotle.  The burgers here are no joke and one of the best in town.  Nice and moist and the condiment pairings are second to none!  Overall, Delux is a great place to hangout for drinks as well as enjoy a great meal.   Service here is always the best and always a welcoming smile. - Enjoy!",

We decided to sit outside.   I ordered the delux burger served medium rare and we ordered fries that were half sweet potato and half regular fries. It's served in a tiny shopping cart basket, haha. I liked the sweet potato fries and the burger was juicy. Not my most favorite burger in the world, but it was good. It was served with like shredded carrots and beets on the side and I didn't know what to do with that! I put it on my burger just in case and it did nothing for the taste but perhaps the texture. I just didn't \"get it\" lol.",

Of course the burger doesn't come with fries like most restaurants nowadays, so that jacked the bill up more than I was hoping.  Okay, so the prices aren't great. It's actually kinda overpriced. One could go to the Vig and get the same quality food for significantly less. However, the service was great. My server continuously asked if I needed anything else and was friendly throughout my visit. The food itself was pretty good, and the fries inside a tiny shopping cart is a nice touch. The atmosphere is unique, dimly lit with blue lights; cool effect! Will I be returning? Probably not anytime soon, as I mentioned, I can eat the same quality food elsewhere at places with equally awesome environments for much less.",

While the food is great there was nothing in the burger that particularly stood out. The meat is juicy and fantastic and the quality of the ingredients is amazing but that being said getting 2 sliders was over $10 and French fries were extra.   I understand that it's in a nice area and appreciate the restraunt as a whole I was just hoping for a more unique burger experience. That being said there are plenty of other options I havent tried and if you want high quality product this place is still most definitely worth seeing",

    "text": "The owner reached out and sent me a gift card to make up for my previous experience so I tried this place again.   I have to say that I went in a little nervous. We ordered two tuna rolls, a Delux burger, and fresh wasabi.  I almost ordered my burger medium temperature because of the issue we had last time. However, I gave this place the benefit of the doubt and ordered the meat done medium rare. Our first visit here must've been a fluke because it was cooked perfectly this time. The flavors were spot on and the quality was great. Do yourself a favor and try one of their burgers!!!  Our tuna rolls were definitely better quality than before. The rice wasn't mealy as it previously was. We started with one and then ordered two because the first was delicious! The reverse happy hour also made the rolls very affordable.   Finally, we ordered fresh wasabi for $3. Our server was nice enough to bring us a small sample which had us hooked since my boyfriend is a wasabi fiend and uses a TON on sushi. It's a little pricey but definitely worth it if you can splurge.   Overall, I'm glad I gave this place a second change and that the owner reached out to make things right. It's a little pricey to be on my regular rotation but a great spot for date night especially if your S/O, like mine, isn't a huge sushi fan but loves a good burger. Heck, I'm craving one of their burgers as I write this!",

But...we got sidetracked with a half order of mixed fries and 'mini burgers.' I'm not sure how a 4 oz. burger is considered mini, but it was pretty phenomenal, so who cares. Perfectly prepared, pink in the middle. I put some of the 'secret aioli' recipe sauce on it (comes with the fries)and, wow. We wanted to try 'My sister Sally's chocolate cake, so we skipped sushi and went straight to dessert. Our server suggested it warm and we said 'Go for it!' So glad we did.

Our group ordered three sushi rolls, two hamburgers and a order of mixed fries as well as two beers and a glass of house red wine.  We finished the meal with key lime pie. Everything was marvelous. The sushi rolls were fresh and flavorful with enough ginger and wasabi to satisfy any palette. The hamburgers were very tasty and you can choose any cheese you want to top your burger. Because the meat is so fresh I recommend cooking the burger medium so that you don't have too much juice making your bun soggy. This establishment has an exceptional beer selection so don't be afraid to try one of the many local brews on tap. You can also try a beer flight if you want a variety of beers to taste. The key lime pie is to die for! If you eat at unconventional times this place stays open until 2 am.  This is a must-visit restaurant if you want a great meal (burgers or sushi) in a fun environment with friendly and knowledgable wait staff.",

I happen to be a fan of well done any kind of sweet potato fries, so Delux 2Go, you're lucky I'm not a tough critic!  (The fries were soggy but oh so yummy!)    I decided to go all out tonight and get a 'Delux Burger' and sweet potato fries (a 1/2 order was plenty).  I think that next time I will opt for the 'Standard Classic Burger' instead.  The caramelized onion and applewood smoked bacon mixture was a little much for me.  Not that the classic burger with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickle isn't a heavy meal, but the delux toppings just made it seem much heavier and is sitting heavy in my stomach as I type!  I think this concept is great... I didn't have to wait to place my order and I ran over to Safeway (next door) to pick up a few necessities and when I returned, my order was ready.    The sandwiches, salads, and desserts were all looking appealing.  I will have to try those in future visits...  a girl can only eat so much!  I was also pleased to see that there is a limited menu from sister restaurant Zen 32 Sushi - sashimi combo (salmon, tuna, and yellowtail), california roll, vegetarian roll, and edamame.    For all of us yelpers that don't really grill or are just interested in picking up food rather than grocery shopping, preparing, cooking, and cleaning, Delux 2 Go is a great solution!",

If you're doing low-carb/ paleo they are more than happy to replace the buns with a lettuce wrap. The servers can seem stressed at times, not sure what's up with that, but there has never been an issue. They even go out of their way to accommodate my nearly deaf and \"not quite with it\" grandmother, which is great. I assure you that's not the reason why  the servers are stressed unless they have phobias of white hair and handicap placards (I usually do the ordering and the tipping).

    "text": "Fabulous food, great prices and they are open LATE!  How did I not know about this place??!!  My fiance and I stumbled on this cute little place while driving back to Phoenix from Scottsdale.  He ordered a burger and I had a salad.  Large portions, great menu choices and top-notch service.    I just love it when the manager works late, cleans tables and talks to the patrons!!  I've certainly included this place on my \"open-late-and-worth-going-to-when-sober\" list!",

Guess what was missing from my roll ... again.   I looked over the wall and yep, it was the same sushi chef who forgot the last time as well. Even the server was surprised it happened again. The director of operations came up and apologized, saying that the sushi chef was new, but that's what they told us the last time and that was back in July. If this much time has passed and they still consider him new, I'm going to start using that excuse at the office asap. Throughout the rest of the night, the sushi chef kept glaring at my boyfriend and I who was facing him, giving us the stink eye because the manager spoke to him about his mistake. As long as he didn't spit in my sushi, I don't really care. I just want to eat what I paid for because eel is not cheap these days.   Food is still good, that's why I come back. I just always hope it's the other sushi chef that's working when I walk in and not this dude who looks like he wants to throw his knife at me over the sushi bar Kill-Bill style.",

So the boy was forced to eat a burger and I felt like I let him down by not noticing that when I looked through the Yelp reviews before going. The (regular) fries in the cute little cart were tasty! I liked my burger ok, but it wasn't my favorite burger ever. We'll try to come back sometime when they do sushi too so my guy can get his fix.",

    "text": "Been to Delux a couple times on gourmet burger hankering. With a side of fries and a big selection of drafts (and misc comfort desserts/drinks), Delux delivers. There is a cool atmosphere, friendly service, and good food.  One item of note, they advertise Niman Ranch Beef, which many see as grass-fed. Their's is specifically listed as grain fed. So, while the treatment of the animals is still better than typical factory facilities, the diet isn't the same as grass fed. Hey, we can all make our own choices, it just kind of perturbs me to see \"vegetarian fed\" advertised when it is a non-issue -- grass fed is the standard.",

I think I showed up around 11 PM on a Sunday, before memorial day, with my girlfriend.  We were pretty hungry.  Nobody really came around to serve us, but a manager walked by and asked if we had been helped.  We said no, but we were ready to order.  She took our order and our actual server came by a few minutes later and apologized for the mix up.  They were out of the beer I ordered, but the server recommended another one (he said it was only available in a few bars in Arizona) and I went with it.  I was just hoping it wouldn't be more than the beer I originally ordered (that would have been shady), but in the end it was actually cheaper and tasted good.  Awesome.  Both my gf and I ordered burgers, medium rare (recommended temperature on the menu) with a lettuce wrap instead of bun.  The burger was good, but definitely could have rested a little longer before it was served.  We both had a huge puddle of juice on our plate after just a bite.  The huge shopping cart of sweet potato fries was pretty awesome too.  One order could feed four people, I'd say.  Delux has a good ambiance, drink selection, and prices.  In the end the service was good and there is some more food and happy hour specials I'd like to try out. Although, I'm hoping it gets a little better.",

    "text": "What's the sign of a fabulous restaurant? I simply cannot get this deelish memory out of my head -- and it's been weeks since I've eaten there. My restaurant habits tend to be that of repetition and fear of trying somewhere new. Having been a vegetarian for over a decade, new menus were more an exercise in fear than a potential find.  So a few weeks ago when I was feeling adventurous, I loaded the kid and the boy in the car and asked who wanted where and what to eat. The regular short list of restaurants offered nothing in the way of interest for any of us, and, desperate, I pulled out the Sidekick 3 to get some ideas. Ryan said he wanted a burger, so I searched for \"best burger near [my zip code]\" and a reference to Delux Burger popped up. It was relatively close to home, so off we went.  Arriving, the outside of the restaurant is a little deceptive. It's in a Safeway shopping center and if you're not looking for Delux, you're likely to miss it altogether. It's a tiny little place with a tiny little patio but (by virtue of being nestled in a shopping center) there's plenty of parking. Moms & Dads: I was a little nervous that an exclusive little diner like this would be the type to be unfriendly to kids, but that's definitely not an issue. Space is scant, but we sat on the patio and it was comfortable.  The menus were skinny and long and consisted mostly of the beer, wine, and liquor selection, which might have been their original focus from the start (but I don't know that for sure). Their hours are 11am-2am, so I think they're really hoping to serve a post-club-but-not-done-partying segment in the wee-er hours. I perused to find something other than beef or chicken (I don't eat either) and was thrilled to find a grown-up grilled cheese (3 cheese, oven-roasted tomatoes, baby arugula on a demi-baguette).  Shortly thereafter, I saw it. The delux Fresh Fish sandwich. The idea of a grilled cheese was interesting given the ingredients, but I wanted something less rich and more flavorful, and here it was, offered up to me in a single menu entry like a hand-picked wildflower from a wide-grinned, grateful, not-expecting-anything-in-return toddler...  From the menu:      Grilled Mahi Mahi marinated in sake and orange juice with wild herbs, served on a toasted, handcrafted brioche bun with redleaf lettuce, all-natural beefsteak tomatoes and red onions accompanied by sides of creme tartar and cucumber-pear medley.  One word describes this sandwich: Divine. It was hot and perfectly cooked. The fish was light and the flavors were magical. The bread wasn't overpowering and the lettuce was proportioned -just enough- to give you a taste and a different texture, but not take the spotlight from what the real star was. I couldn't get enough of this sandwich. Sadly, though, it came to an end much quicker than I'd desired and yet I was still craving more. How often does something so good and good for you leave you so breathless and wanting more?  We had also ordered a \"shopping cart\" of sweet potato and regular french fries (the kid loved that, though toddlers + things on wheels atop on high surfaces are surely a recipe for eventual disaster), and I snacked on those to curb any further temptation to order another sandwich. At $10 a pop, I didn't need to scarf these things like snacks.  The kid had a kids-friendly grilled cheese which was a panini-based creation (very simple) on a bed of french fries, though she didn't want anything to do with those fries when the shopping cart fries were also available and, by virtue of their container, much more tasty! Ryan had a burger and he liked it, too, but I honestly remember very little of our outing as I was too busy flying high on my mahi mahi experience.  Time kinda stood still for a little while and for that I must recommend Delux Burger to anyone who likes to eat stuff that tastes really good.",

I always order the mixed fries (regular and sweet potato mixed together and served in a mini shopping cart) -The blue lighting (under the table and around the small restaurant/bar) which gives the whole place a soothing, yet vibrant blue glow. -Wide selection of Martinis (I would love it more if they weren't at least $11 each, but that's definitely standard for a specialty martini). -Bar setting without carding at the door (then no one gets excluded from delicious food just because they aren't old enough to drink). -Dessert: Mmmm Chocolate  Delux is one of my favorite places to take someone when I want to hop out of the ASU Tempe area (over to Phoenix), but don't want to go too far.   I love the long, slightly higher table with stools (but not as high as a high top) that runs down the center of Delux.  It's always fun to sit next to interesting people and strike up (even brief) conversations as you wait for your food.  The bathrooms are two dark individual rooms (both unisex) with a sink and vanity area between them.  They have bead curtains around the urinals which was a nice was to add some glitz.",

Two burgers, one mixed fries, one lemonade, one Diet Coke and tip came to $39. Fries were very good but because of the poor service it's hard to say how good our cold burgers were. Susan had to ask one of the other servers where our order was because we didn't see our waiter... everyone around us was getting served and they ordered after us. Too bad, we probably won't go back because of the service. I'm sure if they could make all the pieces fit together the place would be great. Just don't want to pay almost $40 for a couple burgers and take that chance again. We'll go to Burger King or McDonald's where we know what to expect.",

I came at lunch and there is no lunch price its still $9.50 cents for burger with no fries.  Grain feed, organic I get it.  Thats why it is pricey.  But it should knock my socks off and this place does not. Comes with carrots and beet strings hmmm.  Good for groups but it is family style seating in the middle of the burger joint.

I ordered their Delux burger, and my boyfriend got their All American Burger.  The meat was good, but nothing to write home about. The garlic sauce they serve with their fries is pretty tasty, but way too heavy on the mayo side. The fries weren't that spectacular, and were pretty gross after they lost their warmth. We didn't go after the sweet potato fries, so maybe that's what we were missing (??) The salad the lady had on the table next to us looked pretty good. Big portions. I dunno, still not sold.  Needless to say, I ended up trashing my left-overs. I guess these are the kinds of things that happen when you find over rated restaurants. You'll find me at Fez.",

You can't be the classic Delux Burger (medium) and a basket of mix fries.   I do want to say that over the past few months however the service has seem to have lost the personal touch and attention to detail I remember. Smiles and warm greetings have been replaced with sometime forgotten orders and rather robotic sever personalities.   Normally that would get a 3-star rating in my book, but there's a special place in my heart for Delux, so they still squeak by with 4.",

It's a pretty cool place, but it's very busy and popular, so it's often difficult to find a good seat. I also don't much care for the way it's set up - you might have to rub elbows with a stranger - it's far from intimate dining... no matter where you sit, your conversation is open game for everyone nearby.   I'll eat here once in awhile, but I'm not their biggest fan and they haven't really won me over ever with their service. I don't know why it's so popular really... maybe it's cuz the menus are fancy looking.",

    "text": "Delux is a somewhat-trendy hangout where you can easily make getting a burger and a beer part of your weekly routine. The atmosphere is sleek and chatty, with a distinct focus on their wide-range of beers on-tap that lines the bar area and a large communal table in the center of the restaurant. Delux rotates seasonal specialties into their beer selection so you're always either trying something new or enjoying an old favorite.  When it comes to the food at Delux the obvious choices are between one of two burgers, the Delux Burger or the Standard Classic. Both are BIG patties of meat that are recommended to be cooked to the rarer side. Which ever you decide on, it's sure to be filling and delicious, especially when paired with a basket of mixed (regular and sweet-potato) fries.  Much can be said about Delux's alternative sandwiches however. The vegetable panini and turkey burgers are flavorful, lighter alternative to the heavy burger. Delux's gazpacho soup is perfect for cooling down in the summer heat or anytime as a small snack.   Service is happy and usually snappy. Prices are reasonable though have risen steadily over the past few years (but where hasn't?). If it's past 10pm and dinner has still yet to be eaten, the choice to go to Delux is a no-brainer! Overall, a great place to frequent in the valley!",

    "text": "As a self proclaimed burger connoisseur I am always on the hunt for a quality burger spot that provides a tasty product without the need to overdo it with toppings and condiments. I am happy to say I have found another place that meets this criteria!   Delux is a small restaurant that doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food they cook up on the inside is bomb! I had the sushi years ago and it was good, but their bragging rights come from their ability to create a darn good burger that stands on its own. There are a few options for burgers including a turkey and veggie version, but I go with the classic and add crispy bacon. They cook them to perfection (medium rare is highly recommended), and when you bite into it the flavors and juice of the meat melts in your mouth. Lately it seems as if places are creating a bigger badder burger with everything besides the kitchen sink as a topping, and in my opinion it ruins the beauty of quality meat. Delux does not do this, they let you taste a good burger as it should be! They also have regular and sweet potato fries that are delicious and seasoned perfectly.   Tonight we ordered to pick up and the guy who took the order could not have been more friendly, competent, and on point with the order. When we got there to pick it up it was ready at our requested time and the order was flawless. Their prices aren't exactly cheap, but it seems to be the going rate these days.   The only thing I don't love about Delux is the atmosphere inside, it's just not my cup of tea. It is modern and tight, so I prefer to order to go.   This place is great, you've gotta try it!",

My coworkers stated that they used to go here for lunch once or twice a week, as it is close to our office in DTP, however after back to back instances of poor service from their server, they had stopped going.  We opted to give it a go again, as they all rave about the Delux Burger, and I really wanted to try the veggie burger.    Food:  The veggie burger was unbelievable, topped with caramelized onions and all the other fixings, and the half and half fries were just as amazing as I remembered them.  My colleagues have never had complaints about the food there, and they stuffed their faces with their burgers as well.  I also had a vanilla shake with caramel, and while it is pretty hard to mess up a milkshake, it was magical.  Service:  We had a server by the name of Mandy, and she couldn't have been more attentive to us.  Given that my coworkers had described some less than stellar past experiences, we couldn't have been more pleased with Mandy, as she was the opposite of what they had previously described.    We will be putting this place back into our regular rotation, due to this awesome lunch experience.",

    "text": "This is the best late night burger and sushi place in town!   Well, it's close to the only such place, which is most certainly a positive.   In any case, Delux is a relic on Yelp. It remains largely unchanged, and reviewers throughout town have doted on their signature burger since Web 1.0. And while I harbor no resentment toward this establishment, I maintain reservations. The atmosphere is stellar, and so are the hours. But I am not quite sure this could stand up to the competition.   The Delux burger consists of a medium burger patty, gruyere cheese, alleged bacon, spinach, and a special sauce, all between a thick, sweet roll. For the usually strong ingredients it boasts, it came across as rather mild to me. I don't think the beef was seasoned at all, and I had to work hard to get past how mushy it was. Correct me if need be, but the point of undercooking beef is to let its quality shine, right? This meat was woefully average. Forgettable, even.   Fries are extra. TONS extra. At $7 for a mix of regular and sweet potato, this is the most expensive order of the side I've ever made. They aren't mind-blowing, but they are good, as is the aioli they're paired with. Ooh and aaah at the little shopping cart they're served in.   In any case, you've just paid 20 bucks for a burger and fries, so you'd hope it'd absolutely blow your mind. It's just OK.   Sushi is in the 'just OK' tier as well. Just your basic tempura, but at least it'll hit the spot at 1am! The happy hour pricing is a negligible difference, by the way, so don't go waiting for it!  In the end, this is a really cool place to hang out. The hours are hella convenient. Paying for that is justified, but goodness gracious let's stop acting like this food is anything above average. It's not.",

It has a great texture, is smoky, a pleasant soft brioche bun, and is very scrumptious.

Let Me Set The Tone...It is close to 10:00p.m and you know that in rizona, there are Very Few Places that serve Food...Let alone, Great Tasting, Quality Food...Not to mention, also has a FULL BAR. If you are ever going to read a YELP Food Review, this is ONE to read. First of all, I have All the Qualifications that makes a Good Reviewer.  1) Experience: I have been coming to Delux since they opened in 2004. The Owner, Lenny Rosenberg is a First Class, Down To Earth Guy who cares about Having GREAT Food, while having a GREAT Experience.  2) The BEST Hours of any Restaurant in Arizona.  Let's be Serious, when it's Midnight and people are Not Ready To Call it a Night...because they Realize they are  HUNGRY. Most people think the Only places open are our Friends Mr. MC Donalds and his Crazy friend  \"Jack\" that lives \"in a Box\"  Forget that  Because Delux is a Must!! 3) Good Restaurants are as only Good as the people that work for them. One of my FAVORITE Things about DELUX is the Staff. From the moment you walk into Delux, you know you are in Good Hands. My Favorite manager Doug is Awesome. Doug has worked for Lenny for years. Because he was a Server for years, he understands what the job entails and what they might be experiencing, because \"his been there\".  Another First Class Employee is The Sushi Specialist, Chef Hershey. He takes Pride in his Work and His Customers. The Man Behind The Grill \"Chef Nick is Quick\" Do Not Let his Speedy Service Fool You. Even Though he gets his food out \"Quick\" Nick always Delivers Great Tasting Food. Hamburgers, Hot Dogs, Sandwiches, Salads, Sushi, Deserts... Delux does it ALL. Server Eddie is new to DELUX but has worked at the finest restaurants in town. I personally believe that Eddie has so much knowledge about this industry, that he should be owning his own Restaurant...but for now, he enjoys the \"No Pressure\" lifestyle that serving brings.  4) Lastly, if anyone says that owning a Restaurant is Easy...They are Full of  Not only that, keeping a Restaurant open for over 15 years is almost unheard of these days. But Lenny has done both. If you haven't had the Pleasure of eating at Delux, Put it on your TO DO LIST...I Promise, Not Only will You NOT be Sorry you did... Your Taste Buds will Thank You.",

    "text": "I consider Delux one of the best spots in Phoenix. Barring a few instances of lackluster service (which management was lightening quick to address), the food has always been wonderful, and the waitstaff friendly and engaging. The drink selection is impressive (over 40 beers on tap, if I recall correctly), and the atmosphere is as memorable as the miniature shopping carts they serve their fries in. I love that they're open late (until 2AM)--there have been so many times I've been up late and looking for a late night place to grab a bite that wasn't a 24-Hour breakfast house, and it's really nice to have a place as high quality as Delux to visit when the urge strikes. This place is also a great middle ground when each person is in the mood for something different. Recently, a friend was in the mood for sushi, and I wanted a burger ...Delux was the perfect solution.  A few things I recommend:  *The Beet Salad *Their Signature Delux Burger (medium-rare :)  *Las Vegas Roll (about as close to 'sushi' as I'm interested in getting) *Sweet Potato Fries or a mix of these and the regular *a side of their aioli (great with fries or even as a spread added to the burger bun) *'Low Carb' California Roll  *Apple Oatmeal cookie (don't roll your eyes at me, I know oatmeal isn't very exciting ...but this cookie is).  They recently remodeled the interior a bit to remove the limited seating arrangement in favor of larger, more comfortable booths. They offer more privacy and a better overall aesthetic.   I've seen a few of the negative reviews, and I think all perspectives can be perfectly valid. I think it's important to remember that running a fast-paced business, especially in the restaurant industry, is no easy task. There are a ton of moving parts, and mistakes are bound to happen here and there. If you've been here before and had a subpar experience, I hope you'll try them out again. This is so much better than your average neighborhood chain burger joint.   P.S. - Shoutout to Mandy and Quin, who made my last experience one of my best.",

We had the Delux burger, mine with a lettuce wrap instead of a bun. Have you ever eaten in a restaurant that offered this option? I felt loved! This is an upscale sushi bar, too. We passed on this. The sushi bar was backed, near the ceiling, with six 42\" screens that showed bubbling water with a few sharks at intervals.  Our waiter was the epitome of professional--a real one! \"Folks, my pleasure, thank you very much.\" Decor was unique with the ceiling designed to muffle. Music was atmospheric, nice to hear. Perfect for fun, quiet, dining. A real keeper, this place.",

I was hesitant to order sushi from here but decided to go ahead and try it. I am so glad that I did. I got the Tiger Roll. On the bottom of the sushi menu it asks for no modifications or substitutions but our wonderful server Lauren said that it would be no problem so I got it without cucumber and added cream cheese. I cannot wait to come back and try another roll. My husband got the duo sliders and asked for them well done and they came out medium rare. He ate one but couldn't manage eating the second. Ended up being okay though since we had ordered an appetizer and he shared some of my sushi. All in all will definitely be back to try more of their menu.",

It didn't take much longer for my food to be ready, definitely quicker than the 20 minutes as previously stated. They separated the fries from the hamburger, so they kept crispy - which is good because I don't' like limp fries. The Delux burger, the namesake, was delicious as always. I love Delux and it's great you can get the same items from the restaurant quick and easy. If you are in a hurry, ordering ahead is a lifesaver.",

In fact, if I lived closer, I'd frequent the place more.  The place is a bit crowded, and definitely LOUD on busy nights.  It's a bar pretty much, so keep that in mind.    Root beer is tasty too.

I quickly browsed over the menu and saw they have a \"Delux Burger.\"  Namesake = Order.  So I did.  Along with a half order of half fries and half sweet potato fries. I make some of the best decisions ever made.  The fries are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  They are on the skinnier side of the fry spectrum, but not the skinniest I've had.  I love crispy fries.  These were the best, I said it, BEST sweet potato fries I've ever consumed. Onto the burger... I ordered mine medium but would have preferred medium well.  It was a bit pinker than I'm used to for medium.  It was delicious, nonetheless.  I'm not a big fan of arugula, but could hardly taste it because the flavors from the cheese, beef, bacon, and onions.  It was definitely a gourmet burger.   They offered tasting flights of beer that we had to talk ourselves out of since we were having lunch during a work day.  I can't wait to go back and be able to enjoy a beer with a burger.  Yum!!",

At one time my favorite local beer and burger spot, but now, just a distant memory.  I've given Delux soooo many chances to change my mind.  Beer is now often flat, and my burger never comes out right the first time around.  I really hope they can fix the problems and bring back the Delux I was knew and loved.",

My boss and I split a basket of mixed fries (I dig the little shopping cart baskets). The fries weren't outstanding but I appreciated having 2 dipping options - ketchup v. aioli. He had the regular burger, which was devoured in a matter of minutes. I had the turkey burger wrapped in lettuce - it was the most flavorful turkey burger I've ever had! I covered it with the avocado and fresh salsa that accompanied it on the side.   Overall it was a good lunch! I always appreciate a restaurant with good burgers and an open kitchen.",

We were definitely not disappointed.  The portions were generous and well worth it.  It definitely is a little pricey for burgers and fries (we probably paid about $35 for 2 people)  But if you want quality, go to Delux!  Our waiter was one of the best servers we have had in awhile.  He was on top of things and very friendly.  We never had to ask for drink refills or condiments, he was always 2 steps ahead of us.  The ambiance was very inviting as well.  And the best part?  ITS OPEN LATE!",

Order up a \"basket\" (served in a miniature shopping cart) of sweet potato french fries and you have a not-so-ordinary dining experience.  Beer. Beer, beer and more beer. So much beer that the sheer volume of it outnumbers the rest of the items on the menu. From Microwbrews to Michelob, you're sure to find something cold and refreshing. The sweet raspberry lambic is a nice way to top off your meal.  The interior is a bit small and it's often crowded and very noisy. Carrying on a conversation inside when it's busy is next to impossible without having to shout. If you can get a seat outside, I would go for it. Keep in mind that Delux is located in a strip mall so you'll be constantly barraged with cars driving by.",

I had the chocolate cupcake which was not good - there was 3x the amount of icing as there was cake and it was just not an enjoyable experience.  When we ordered tea, they looked at us like we had 3 heads.  We got crappy orange pekoe tea.  They gave us these huge styrofoam cups which they only filled about 1/4 of the way.  We asked for more water of course.  Then they gave us soda cup lids and straws.  Yes, straws....for hot tea.  I get that it's a multi-purpose bakery-deli-prepared foods to go type deal but maybe they should focus on getting one thing right before trying to serve too many diverse needs.",

I can always go for a burger, so I was game.  Well, she was let down (initially!) since they don't have vegetarian patties.  They do, however, have many other vegetarian delights!  She had the grilled cheese and enjoyed it.  I had a bacon cheeseburger and it was cooked to perfection.  The bacon wasn't too crunchy or too soft, and the bun tasted and felt fresh.  We got the normal fries, and they were very good.  Not too thick, and tasted fresh.  They give you a variety of sauces to dip them in.  The service was beyond excellent!  Our waitress was on the ball.  She filled our drinks very often, brought out our food with amazing speed, and was very attentive in all she did.  There are a few minor things I didn't like.  Certainly nothing enough to take away from the rating.  The restaurant feels cramped.  Inside, you may have to share a table with others you don't know in bar-like seating, and outside on the patio, they shoved in as many tables as they could fit, and the seats aren't all that comfortable.  I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "So after hearing good things for a while, I finally got a chance to check out Delux last night and I had to put my two cents in.   It was a Friday, so I expected a bit of a wait, but the wait wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, especially since we decided to wait for an indoor table. I was excited that we were seated at the blue-lit center table - the only negative is the stools become very uncomfortable after some time, but everything else more than made up for it.  I was pretty impressed overall. Friendly service, cool atmosphere and really good food - and I definitely felt like we got our money's worth. I ordered a dirty martini that was really more like two, since they left the shaker with me. Both their regular and sweet potato fries are really good, with a great dipping sauce. I decided I had to go for the delux burger - and for $9.50 you get a lot of burger, not only in size but also in flavor. It's smothered in maytag and gruyere cheese and caramelized onions and I love the bread they use for the bun. Oh and I love how they recommend it cooked medium-rare - perfect.  I didn't have beer this time, but I'll definitely go back for the beer selection. It was very exciting to see how many they had on tap for such a small restaurant.   Due to it's smaller size, it's probably not a great place for a big group, but if you have just a few people, it's a fun place and you definitely you get your money's worth. Oh and did I mention they serve food till 2 a.m., everyday? That's amazing for Phoenix. I'll definitely be back.",

Any place that my uber-picky, easily disgruntled, vociferously opinionated tipsy father finds no fault with should be heralded with a choir.   The Deluxtini, which you feel like a dumbass ordering, is some concoction of orange vodka, pineapple juice, champagne, and peach nectar. $11 sounds like a lot until you see the shaker that comes out with it -- easily, there's three full martini glasses' worth in it. Okay, I was solidly buzzed. The beer list is huge, and they have my SO's Chimay, so bonus points there.  I love sweet potato fries, even these, which were a bit on the flaccid side. The much-heralded orange sauce is tasty as well. The roasted vegetable panini was excellent, but not quite cheesy enough; next time I will stick with the grilled cheese panini, which is a fatty bit of heaven. My dad and SO split a burger and the caprese panini, and again, both seemed relatively content, a rarity.  Dessert (chocolate cake and a vanilla malt) and coffee were generously portioned and delicious.   Our server was fabulous - very helpful, friendly, genuine, and never once tried to rush us out of there, even when it got super busy. Oh yeah, and we get to the minus-one-star area: it's fucking busy. The parking lot is a Range Rover disaster waiting to happen. The whole shopping center is really a trendy yuppie Mecca - pure chaos.  Getting there early, as we did, circumvented some of that, but in general - it's verging on a Xanax moment.",

Brad is awesome (I'm bad with names so I am only 97.4% sure that's really his name) and has helped me a few times and was great and always talks to me when I come back even when he hasn't been our server (why I don't ask to be seated in his section, I do not know). One of the assistant managers is also great and very friendly and personable. It's everyone else there that seems to be the issue. One female server was nice just not personable at all. One male server was just kind of lame. It's the last one that I really had an issue with. Not friendly, not personable. I went there at around 10:30pm with a friend of mine. We split the caprese salad and she ordered a half basket of sweet potato fries. I had a beer and hotdog and then we split a milkshake. He brought my friend a mixed basket of fries. She was ok with that so we didn't say anything. Later in the meal he came back and left the bill and we had to flag him down to ask for dessert. He brought it  and left the bill again. My friend and I were going dutch and each paid with separate credit cards. After putting the cards in the bill...thing (is there a more technical term for it?) he quickly walked by picked it up didn't say anything to us or come to ask how we wanted it split, he just split it 50/50. That was really annoying! I mean more so for my friend than me since my portion was much more expensive than hers. I still give it 3 stars though. If they can kick the service back up to where it used to be, they'll get 5 stars again in no time!",

My food was so bad I just pushed it away after a few bites and had to ask a friend for a mint to get the vial flavor out of my mouth.  I had the Cool Chicken Salad Sandwich. The Bread was dry, the chicken dry, the mayo mixture was flavorless, the only thing that had any flavor was the slice of Swiss Cheese. What a waste of $12.00.  I give this place a below zero but Yelp won't let me do that!",

    "text": "10 years ago, Delux was the spot. Phoenix was less a foodie town, and there were FAR fewer options for burgers around 2005. and so Delux was a place i hit whenever i visited Phx. now that i live here, and i see Delux more often and have gone there a few times over the past couple years, i'm gonna say it's a straight-up middle of the road burger joint with pretty decent parking and seating...but high-ish prices for what you get and a fairly obnoxious noise level inside, sometimes from the servers themselves when they congregate by the order-up area.  THE FOOD ordered a burger well and it was plain BURNT, son! major problems there when you a BURGER joint serving burnt bricks. BOO.  fries were good and dipping aioli and catsup complemented nicely. but holy hell there's A LOT of salt there. i would like more potato flavor and less sodium...but these are probably frozen and not fresh cut and so there ya go.  sandwiches...meh...similar to Crapplebee's or Chili's. big portions of wholesale supermarket ingredients.  dessert - afterthought.  booze selection - good.  shakes - COME ON, all shakes are delicious.  THE SERVICE on a recent visit we had Doug and he was FIVE STARS all day - a True professional doing the best one can in a mediocre environment. again, some of the other servers were loud as all get-out by the pick-up area and that was unpleasant. the noise in Delux is pretty healthy to begin with. i don't need the damn supervisor (hipster dude with glasses) amping it up to 11 with his cackling and joking with his staff: GET BACK TO WORK!  so, depending on who you get, service can be quite great........or dumb.  THE LOCATION hip decor...ACOUSTICS FOR SH*T - sorry but this place is just too LLLOOOUUUDDD if it's even half full. having a bar SO close to the sit-down dining is a bad design, because it makes those tables and chairs ---too close together to start with--- even more claustrophobic.  THE PARKING easy peasy. it's a damn strip mall so boomshackalacka.  PRICES for Applebee's-level food: high. about $25 per person with drinks and $20 per without.   OVERALL Delux burger has peaked. at least half of the service is not properly trained or monitored. the food is meh; the drinks are boppin but the space is too uncomfortable for a long haul. pass. next time i'd rather try Two Hippies, Smash Burger, or a funky Hillstone for that matter.",

    "text": "Good Turkey Burger, Excellent Fries, Pricey But High Quality Ingredients  I went here last week on the sincere recommendation of a friend who loves turkey burgers (doesn't eat beef or pork). Of course, I tried the turkey burger.   I arrived after the lunch hour, so the restaurant was not crowded. I was immediately seated provided a menu, and offered a beverage. Service remained excellent throughout my visit.   The menu offered many attractive options, but since my mind was already made up, I ordered the Turkey Burger. As an afterthought, I also ordered a half order of regular fries (they also offer sweet potato), which my friend had said were delicious.   Fairly quickly, my server brought me my fries, and told me that my turkey burger would be up shortly. This would have been a problem if I had wanted the fries in tandem with my burger. Here is a tip - if you want burger and fries together, tell them when you order. I noticed that the other diners also received their fries prior to their entrees - like an appetizer. I was hungry, and didn't mind the delivery of the fries first. They were hot, thin, very crisp, perfectly lightly salted, sprinkled with parsley, and served with amazing catsup and delicious spicy aioli for dipping. Yum. These are a must have.  At about the perfect moment, my Turkey Burger arrived. All-natural, extra-lean ground turkey breast served on a toasted wheat bun with red leaf lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, and sides of pico de gallo and fat free garlic & cilantro aioli. Per my friend's recommendation, I added the sides to my turkey burger. The only problem with this burger was that it was too thick (even with squeezing) to get into my mouth for a complete bite of everything. I did my best, but I really hope that no one was watching me. I would have liked my turkey burger a touch less lean, but the sides, avocado and tomatoes added moisture and fat that was much needed.  The portions were generous, and had I not been so hungry, I'm sure that I would have taken half of my burger home. As it ended up, I abandoned half of the bun. I didn't notice initially, but I could have had a lettuce wrap instead of the bun. That is what I will do next time.   Yes, next time. There are great burger, salad, and sandwich options, in addition to sushi after 4pm, and daily soup specials.   This was not an inexpensive place to dine, but the quality and service were worth it. For their burgers, they use Niman Ranch beef and other high quality ingredients. They also have a full bar, and extensive beer and drink menu. Seating was tight, so I will likely go back during their off peak hours again.",

    "text": "I'm really sad to write this review.  Both my fiance and I love Delux, but after our last dining experience there, I don't think we will return. We stopped in late on a Sunday afternoon for lunch- around 3:30PM.  We were both starving, borderline hangry starving, and a burger and fries from Delux sounded delicious!  We took a seat at the bar and were greeted promptly, although the bartender seemed slightly annoyed to have guests.  We placed our drink and food orders quickly, and sipped on our drinks while we waited. I am sure most people know, and understand, the feeling of being STARVING.  Any movement at the food window prompts a glance- and a prayer- for your food.  We watched ours get put in the window about 10 minutes after our order was placed.  We also watched 3 servers and the manager look at the ticket and our food, and then walk away.  We were tempted to grab the food ourselves, but as a former server, I cringed at the thought of doing so.  By the way, the bartender was nowhere to be seen, and hadn't been present since he delivered our drinks. After about 3-4 minutes later, the manager finally picked up and delivered our food.  This may have been prompted by my fiance loudly commenting on how hungry he was, since she (manager) and a female server were standing inches away just chatting about life and enjoying a lovely Sunday afternoon.  I am not saying my fiance was right (I shushed him), but it got the job done.  Food was delivered and of course the fries were cold.  Burger was nothing special- I would have had a better burger at In-N-Out for 1/3 the price.  Overall, food was gross and not worth the price.  I left over half of my burger, which in itself is an accomplishment.  I love a good burger!  And on another note, which had nothing to do with the food, there were two other things that occurred during our visit that left such a bad taste in our mouths.  First, there was an unpleasant odor that permeated the restaurant.  I personally thought it smelled slightly of dirty cat litter, fiance said he didn't notice.  Second, the friendliness and professionalism of the staff left a lot to be desired.  Our bartender- a male- was unfriendly and present maybe 10% of the meal.  Maybe.  The female manager was in hippie fringe booties with a long sleeveless dress and her waist length hair untied.  I was a server in Arizona for over 10 years, and I still work in the food service industry.  From what I can recall, both are health code violations in a restaurant, and they just added a negative element to the experience.  While she has lovely hair, when they are waving around my food nilly willy, it is gross.  Additionally, the other 3 female staff members on shift seemed more concerned about gossiping and wandering around than actually caring for guests.  Having shitty food isn't always a deal breaker, but professionalism and environment can truly make- or break- a meal.  Perhaps of the staff had been more attentive to our meal, our burgers and fries wouldn't have been cold.  Perhaps if the bartender had reappeared from wherever he was hiding, we would have had the chance to tell him how bad our food was, rather than leave this review.  Perhaps if the manager was less interested in gossiping with her staff than ensuring her guests had a quality meal- and experience- we would remain loyal guests of Delux.",

It is a great way to enjoy multiple drinks without overdoing it. Which most people do easily because they cannot hold their liquor... ha!  Ordering the mixed fries shopping cart basket is a unique culinary experience. I daresay that it is borderline semi genius. The use of regular and sweet potato fries is a fantastic flavor blend. I had ordered just a simple bacon beef burger so I could deduce the quality of their meat. The bacon was cooked very well and the beef tender (all natural from Niman ranch). I am surprised they are not packed consistently.  This place is chill for either an afternoon, evening or late night dining experience. Whether you go there to meet an old friend, a group of colleagues, or a date this place is fun for all! What is even better now than before is that the other side of 'the wall' is Delux's sushi bar. It is a great addition to an already gem of the desert. I recommend this venue to anyone and everyone that lives in the Phx Metro area and surrounding cities.",

    "text": "One lookat a picture of their signature burger and fries and its clear that they have completely copied Father's Office (Burger joint in Los Angeles). The problem with copying FO is that their legions of fans have no choice but to make the comparison.  So, I'm not reviewing this just as a burger, but as a FO wannabe. And as a wannabe, it falls well short of the mark.   First, although they seem to have gotten the ingredients right, the bun is too thick, the patty too thin and dry, and the toppings less flavorful. The regular fries are limp and bland, the sweet potato fries are better, but too thin. The sauce (they serve ketchup and some sort of aioli) doesn't hold a candle to FO's signature aioli.   The rest of Delux's menu is unnecessarily huge and for some reason they also serve sushi. Who wants sushi from a burger place or burgers from a sushi place?  Better to do one thing right than 2 things badly.   The ambiance isn't much better. The restaurant is located in a Safeway strip-mall. They have an indoor area mostly made up of community tables and a cramped outdoor area overlooking a parking lot with misters spraying the patrons. For some reason they decided to give it a club-like atmosphere with blue lights shining down on the badly prepared food and simultaneously made it family friendly by letting children of all ages eat there. The result is a hodgepodge of burgers, beers, parked cars, raw fish, and crying children.   All in all, a poor imitation.",

The classic burger didn't have much flavor despite having lettuce, pickles, onions, tomato, swiss cheese, and ketchup. The burger felt dry and wasn't very juicy. The fries were extremely large in quantity but not very tasty. They reminded me of luke warm fast food fries.  My girlfriend got the veggie burger and did really like the patty itself, but wasn't a fan of the rest.  Finally, the service was really slow and we were cramped in a table on the patio sanwhiched between several other tables.  Go to hopdoddys and spend less money and get way better food.",

From my understanding, this place is also a take on the former restaurant Zen 32, which served sushi. However, sushi here is not served until after 4pm and they also have reverse happy hour. From hostess to waiter, both were very attentive. We were promptly seated, drink orders taken, and quickly followed with our lunch order. I ordered the grilled chicken panini and my friend had the turkey burger wrapped in lettuce. Unfortunately, I opted to eat a bit healthier and skipped out on fries. Overall, our meal was delicious and portions were great for the price. I will definitely be back to try out there burgers!",

Fries were abundant, so if you are not wanting a huge meal, get the half order.  Then there was Sushi!  Normally I always avoid eating sushi anywhere that serves something other than sushi, but I made an exception and grabbed a roll.  Nothing great about it, but nothing bad about it either.  A buddy had a milkshake and said it was legit.  My recommendation would be to grab a burger, fries and a shake and enjoy at Delux.",

Came on a Friday night and sat on the sushi side which was a bit quieter than the other burger side with the bar. Waiter was super attentive and chatty, which I love :) He gave us lots of recommendations. I took a risk and tried the Delux sushi roll even though I don't usually go for raw fish (well, seared salmon is still raw to me). It was soooo good! Perfect amount of spice and so much flavor. I can't wait to go back just to get it again.   They offer reverse happy hour and lots of drink/food specials. Seem like they have a great dessert menu-- although the apple pie that's posted in one of the pictures here on Yelp is no longer being served. So don't get your hopes up on that because I was pretty bummed! They do have lots of other dessert options. Be sure to try the mix of regular and sweet potato fries!",

    "text": "We stopped by Delux on a late Saturday night after putting it off for several months. Having dined at the nearby Mexx32, we expected a pretty average experience. Delux has been around for awhile now, which means that they were one of the earlier adopters to the whole \"upscale\" burger trend that has since over-saturated the city. That's probably why most of the awards that they report were given out around a decade ago when places like this were still relatively uncommon.  The burger dining area was actually full, so we were seated on the sushi side of the restaurant. People describe it as trendy, but I consider it more to be along the lines of mid-00s Scottsdale as opposed to present day. The bar plays this video on a continuous loop that simulates bubbly water, with the occasional appearance of a badly animated shark. That's one of the problems with going with a trendy atmosphere. While it may have seemed cool at the time, it now looks pretty generic.  We started with a toasted demi-baugette, which includes olive oil and balsamic reduction. It was okay, but not much different than something that could be emulated at home.  I ordered a Delux burger, replacing the bleu cheese with American, due to my renowned hatred for anything within the bleu cheese family. My girlfriend ordered a classic, both cooked medium well, despite their medium rare recommendations which just seem a bit nasty when it comes to ground beef. Honestly, both burgers were just okay. My girlfriend felt hers was desperately in need of some type of condiment, while mine had a bit more life thanks to the inclusion of caramelized onions. Both burgers had decent quality beef, but I wouldn't quit put their burgers on the same level as say Ingo or Hopdoddy in terms of quality or creativity.    We disregarded their usual list of desserts and instead opted for the chocolate cake made with Mexican cocoa. It was actually very good and highly recommended, in contrast to the shakes or desserts that use Haagen-Dazs, a concept that was probably much cooler before Smashburger adopted it.  Honestly, there's nothing about Delux that's bad, but there's not really anything about it that I found incredibly great either. It's just a pretty generic upscale burger experience that was probably considered significantly more \"special\" a decade ago in comparison to now.   I'll give it an average three. But rest assured, if you do your research, there are far better options available if you're seeking a great burger.",

He let me know that he was buying lunch on the way down to the airport.  I hadn't been to Delux in about 6 months and a burger sounded great. I mentioned to him how good their burgers were (Best in Phoenix!), and he wanted to try it out.  Free Delux Burger?  Yes...yes indeed!    We walked in, were seated immediately and served water (the waiter instinctively brought my son his own plastic cup with a lid on it...I appreciated it.).  I noticed that they had a little pop up flyer/table piece that was advertising their \"Lunch Special\" between 12-4 any day of the week, you could get a Delux burger and fries for $12.00.  Um.....SOLD!   I ordered my Delux burger medium rare and got regular fries (you have your choice of sweet potato also).  Here is how it was.........  Delux Burger-  Nothing has changed!  And that is exactly what I wanted to see.  Delux burger is hands down the best burger in Phoenix, and it's definitely in my top 3 burgers in the USA.  They use superb quality Niman Ranch beef, which is absolutely perfect when cooked medium rare.  Juicy, tasty and flat out delicious.  The baguette they use is perfect.  Its sturdy, yet soft and chewy and is the perfect bread for this type of burger.  Sandwiched between this great bread and on top of the burger are blue and gruyere cheese, some baby arugula, and their caramelized onion/bacon jam/spread.  The flavors work so well together, its absolute perfection.  Find a better burger in Phoenix.  I dare you!  The fries were good (the few that I had, because my son, Bill, mowed down 80% of my fries, as well as about half of my buddies.)    Can't say enough about Delux!  Service is always friendly, the food is always fantastic, and every single person I have brought here, has loved it.  Don't change a thing, Delux...don't change a thing!  See you soon for another fantastic burger!",

Eating a rectangle burger was a fun twist, too, as I've almost always eaten round burgers. It was also the perfect portion to fill me up without busting my gut.  Now, I'm not a fan of shoestring fries. They've always seems to delicate and skimpy for me. But the sweet potato fries were excellent, dipped in the garlic aioli.  The decor is pleasant and at 7:30 on a Thursday night there wasn't a crowd. But there was a drunk dude at the bar area who thought he has something important to say.",

They did a good job on creating signature drinks and breaking down the beer selection into styles, Lagers, Ambers, Porters/Stouts, etc. To help the not so intelligent beer drinker figure out what looked delicious.   -Pop quiz: How does a restaurant get away selling a hamburger for $9.50? Topless servers? No. Lottery ticket with every purchase? No. It's by hand crafting their burgers, with bits of blue cheese, serving them with rocket (arugula for the lame) and caramelized onions on a bakery roll. The burgers are cooked to the customers specifics, Rare, Med, Rare, etc, which is a nice change of pace from the fast food joints. The roll does get a bit soggy, but that is just culinary chemistry. When proteins cook, they squeeze moisture out. Once a burger goes straight from grill to bun and cut in half, the juices start flowing. They might want to revisit their burger display idea and either leave it whole or let it rest for a few minutes after grilling to let the juices redistribute.   -Also their sweet tater fries are delicious. I'm sure they're commercial made fries, but they are tasty. And served in a cute little mini-shopping cart (Gag me now)  All in all. Want something to eat after 10pm? Go get a burger and beer and hangout on the patio.",

Plus now that I'm part of a group of regulars (that happen to tip generously, which may play a part in improved service), we get hella good service from our regular cycle of about three different guys.

I have heard their paninis and salads are great, but if I'm going to Delux, I'm ordering the burger.   I have been to Delux several times and their extensive beer selection, creative drinks, and consistent great service makes their experience just that much more enjoyable.   There are hundreds of reviews, so see them for details regarding the atmosphere and specifics, but I can reassure you their burgers are the best.   Brett is the most attentive, pleasant, and knowledgeable server I've had at Delux (July 2010).",

    "text": "Any place that serves sweet potato french fries rates high in my book. Couple the fries with the savory dipping sauce and a cute presentation --the fries came out in a little metal shopping cart (everyone say \"awe\") --and I'll give the place a five star rating.   So, why the three star rating? Well, the place is just too small for its britches. The space is cramped. For the price I'm paying for the burger, I don't want to feel my elbows rubbing against a stranger sitting next to me.   Speaking of the burger. My husband ordered the Delux burger and proclaimed it one the best burgers he's had!   I ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad and was surprised that the chicken looked and tasted like it was processed (not freshly grilled). It was a savory salad -- I just want fresh chicken on my salad - especially when I'm paying $12 bucks for a salad.   Another downside is that Delux is located in a strip mall. I think I would find the place more endearing if it were located, say, on Central Avenue as a standalone restaurant. Also, one other thing to note: The place seems to be frequented by a younger crowd (high school and college age kids driving up in their BMWs and Land Rovers). I'm not making judgements. I'm just sayinggggg.....",

What this place lacks in taste (food, not style) it makes up for in atmosphere and design. I cannot express how overjoyed I was when I stepped in and was relieved to discover that this place wasn't some ridiculous Scottsdale scheme of making a \"burger nightclub\".   The best things on the menu are the fries, the sweet potato fries to be more exact. As far as burgers go, I've had better but that's not saying that the burgers here are sub-par at all; they're just not something to break an arm over like everyone raves. I think the aesthetic look of the place definitely makes the experience of eating there more fun as well as making it a great place to unwind with friends at 1:30 AM. The staff and bar are both great and definitely add to the chill setting that makes me want to come back for more.   Go there for the mood and the fries, but if you're honest you won't be so quick to hop on the \"I love their burgers\" train.",

First of all we had a large group and the seating is mostly for groups of 4 or smaller. The staff created a little private area so all of us could still sit together which was awesome! When it came to the food most of us ordered different types of burgers from coby beef, to turkey burger, to veggie burger but we all agreed that they were some of the best we've experience in the valley! Also we ordered tons of fries they have regular and sweet potato or you can get a mixed batch, but the coolest part is the little mini shopping cart that they are delivered in! you should have seen our table littered with carts! Must try for those fans of a tasty burger!",

It comes with sauerkraut and choice of mustards, or whatever else you want on it. Their \"basket\" of sweet potato fries are on time as well. Literally a small metal shopping basket. I like them with regular ketchup, but they are served with a dipping sauce that is pretty good. I have had the Delux Burger once. It was good as well, but i always get the dog.   They have a great selection of beers, but I always go to the old standby; Stella Artois, in authentic glass and all. My none beer drinking friend Dally even gets some sort of fruity ale-type beer. So it has a good mix.   They have a pretty decent dessert menu as well. I have split the banana split sundae before and couldn't get through it all. It could probably feed 4 or 5.   Delux is great. It is open late, but can have a wait earlier in the evening.",

I like to research restaurants on Yelp when I go out on my trips so naturally I found Delux.  The interior had this modern look - almost like a lounge rather than a restaurant.  We decided to sit outside because it seemed too crowded inside where you don't really have a table and just sit at a long counter next to other people.  I already had a burger for lunch that day, so I didn't want to get another burger.  I got the chicken panini instead - big mistake.  It was dry and tastless.  Nothing much else to say about it.  My friend had the burger which he claims was very good.  They did have a good selection of beers though.  If I'm ever out here again I'll definitely stop by again and try the BURGER Instead.",

I got the turkey burger, fiance got a chicken sandwich, and we split a \"basket\" of sweet potato fries. Their \"basket\" is extremely small - even if served in a mini shopping cart.  The turkey burger falls apart easily and is sort of dry.  The killer here is the price.  This meal comes to $30 with tip.  That is pretty hefty cost for a burger and splitting a medium order of fries.  They do have a nice beer list and the cupcakes that are made next door and served as a dessert here are delicious but this doesn't outweigh the high cost, low amount fries, and the awful conversations you have to put up with (this is a personal view, and why I don't live in scottsdale).  I'd recommend checking out Soma Cafe for a better burger + sweet potato fries.",

    "text": "After slamming Scottsdale's Roaring Fork for their dry-as-hell Big Ass Burger, I felt it was only right I let those in the greater Phoenix area know who has a real burger.  Delux has a real burger.  Granted it is not on as many \"Top Ten\" lists as the Big Ass Burger, but how often are those things right, anyway?  I suspect those reviews are too often written by journalistic whores who make underhanded deals with restaurant owners, trading free meals on their knees and two-night-a-week access to the bottom shelf in exchange for plugging a restaurant's mediocre fare.  Luckily my fellow yelpers are much smarter than that. How much smarter?  Much smarter enough to trust a random stranger who utilizes a terrifying picture of Conrad Veidt as his personal icon and writes food reviews at 2:00 in the morning.  Damn straight!  Now, on to the food!  I have been going to Delux burger for about nine years, and the menu has grown vastly in that time.  However, I don't often stray from getting the Classic Burger.  It is always cooked great, and medium-rare means you are going to get your burger medium rare.  Full of flavor and just damn delightful.  It's like a flavor explosion in your mouth.  You know that Deftones' song, \"Passenger\"?  It's like that - but in your mouth.  If you aren't familiar with the song, trust me when I tell you this is a very good thing.  And I don't even really like the Deftones.  Or Tool.  I would also recommend the Delux Burger, the namesake, the flagship, the Big Kahuna, the Keyser Soze, the mysterious golden-light-coming-out-of-the-briefcase.  Okay, so it's not as good as all that, but it is pretty tasty.  For the Los Angelenos out there, the Delux Burger is a direct rip-off of the Father's Office Office burger (Santa Monica), complete with the baby arugula.  The difference?  Delux is less cocksure and will let you have all the ketchup you want.  Boo-ya, Father's Office.  Boo-ya.  I have never had a bad burger at this place.  The food is consistently exceptional.  My ex-girlfriend introduced me to Delux, so I cry a little bit every time, but the bittersweet, nostalgic ache in my heart is quickly soothed by the delicious red meat, grilled onions, and toasted bun I stuff in my mouth.  Despite the emotional baggage waiting for me whenever I arrive, I can still recognize it is a good place for a date.  My half-Japanese girl (who does it to me every time) really likes the sushi, and they give you as much hot water as you request to squeeze every last drop of life out of your bag of green tea.  If you are looking for a good burger, look no further than Delux.  Tell them Tommy sent you, and they will look at you blankly and nothing will happen.  You won't regret it.  Any of it.",

I myself have been dying to try it for some time now and my bf happened to be having a burger craving last night. After some convincing, we went to Delux and for a small place, was so happy to be seated right away because it was 8pm and we were HUNGRY. The ambiance of the place is \"bar and lounge\" which to me was nice especially for a Friday night. However my bf wasn't initially pleased because of the dim lighting and the fact that he wouldn't be able to \"see his food.\" Let's just say that didn't matter anymore because his first words after his first bite of the Delux burger was, \"burger craving fulfilled!\" ... And after trying it myself, I was impressed. Definitely one of the best burgers I've tried. I got the veggie burger which was good, but I wish I had ordered the Delux burger as well! We also got an order of mixed fries (regular & sweet potato) a la carte (literally, in a super cute tiny shopping cart!) and was very pleased! My bf who also was not a sweet potato fan just became one because theirs were that good... And the aioli sauce it came with helped a ton!   Our server was more than attentive and we even got a visit and chat from who I believe was the owner which was very nice. We were curious to try the sushi that they recently started serving there, which the owner explained stems from his other restaurant, Zen 32.. But we will save that for next time because we will definitely be back!",

The atmosphere at night is beautiful and low key. Great date night place for sure!  The best part is they're open until 2am! My friends and I were looking for some late night quality food and where else better than Delux :)",

No complaints whatsoever about the food.   Prices on the other hand? Not so much. My slider duo was $11.75 and didn't come with fries. That was another $3 for a half order. $15 for two sliders and fries? Ouch. Her salad was $10, which at least was a very healthy portion of salad. I also ordered a draft root beer, which was also delicious. That ran $3.50, and no refills. Nearly $20 ($18.25) for a pair of sliders, fries, and a drink? That's not cool.   Don't get me wrong. I don't mind paying for quality. And the service is fantastic. I just think you're paying a little too much for the quality at Delux. Protip: Get the half order of fries at $3. It's more than enough.  I'd come back -- as the food is that good -- but keep in mind you're looking at almost $40 for two (with tip) for a burger joint.",

What's even more surprising is the sliders. One of the best in town and very juicy. This place is a hodgepodge of asian and american. It's confusing and awesome at same time.  They offer authentic asian sushi, but also serve one of the juiciest american sliders I've ever had. I have no idea how to categorize this restaurant, but you should just try it out. They have happy hour and reverse happy hour!  Great ambience for a date. Lenny the Owner is super nice too. He's at the restaurant usually ever night eating with the rest of us!",

Order a basket (or 1/2 basket) of mixed if you can't decide. The low rating is the result of two poor customer service experiences, both at the take-out counter.   Take-out is on the sushi side where you can call in or order at the register. While looking at the menu and asking questions about bun/cheese options, the gal at the register's attention was divided between me and a fellow co-worker (it may have been the owner). While she answered my questions, she wasn't particularly pleasant and I left feeling as though asking questions about their menu was bothersome to her.  To the staff:  Take care of one person at a time and don't rush your patrons. If you must be interrupted, be apologetic so your customers know their time and patronage is appreciated and respected. If you can't give customers this attention they deserve, add more personnel. Your food is great, but the customer service could use improvement.",

The second is that they're trying to satisfy couples or groups where somebody wants sushi and somebody else wants burgers, and they're gonna please both. I also wonder if most people order both or stick with one. Of course, because we were there, I had to order both.  I was really just expecting both foods to be mediocre at best. It turns out that both were quite good. I appreciated the options of smaller burgers and 1/2 fry orders (plus mixed sweet potato and regular!!!).   Props to people who can mix bites of burger and sushi...I found it easier to finish the burger/fries and then have a sushi \"dessert.\"   This place is totally weird, but it works for me.",

I like Delux because the sushi is pretty decent and they're open late. I love love love their reverse happy hour! The service is pretty standard. Good ambiance, a little loud but still enjoyable. This is a great place to go alone and enjoy the late happy hour with a roll or two. They have an animated shark tank above the sushi bar which is fun to sit back and watch for a bit. I think the rolls are a little too thick to comfortably fit in your mouth in one bite (the rice ratio is a little off), but the roll varieties that I have tied have been really good. Definitely try the tiger roll is you are looking for something sweet and spicy!",

I am always greeted immediately upon entry and have never (regardless of the hour) waited more than 30 seconds for a table.    Last night I had the Turkey Burger (outstanding, btw) and the sweet potato fries. I had the best service from Tara who was totally personable and on top of our drinks, meal, etc.  In the end she recommended a unique dessert that can only be found at their restaurant.  It was a chocolate cake with cream cheese icing and your choice of a flavor of ice cream.  I had the strawberry.  The dessert was spot on and I will definitely come back hungry for it.    I really do not think you can go wrong with their food. I have had many meals like the panini's, burgers, salads here over the past 3-4 years and they have always been good and consistent.  As a reminder, you get what you pay for, and I have no problem paying their reasonable prices for good quality food.  I can't wait to go back.",

Cooks are excellent, quick, and consistent...the waiters not so much, they are very friendly but often forgetful and slow for simple requests.  Sushi is also probably the best I've had (although the portions are much smaller than they used to be but still the pretty high price) if it's packed you may not want to get sushi though the wait for sushi is often VERY long I'd say 75% of the time. I do remember one time I came and only ordered sushi, the rest of the table had already ordered, received, and finished their meals before I ever got my Sushi rolls this was the second time this had happened.  Overall though it's the quality of the ingredients and how they are combined that trumps the wait and makes everything here delicious and keeps us coming back no matter what.

It is also the restaurant I have visited most consistently since moving out to Phoenix. Being open until 2:00 AM is another huge plus, especially if your priority is food. I have spent many a late night poker winnings on the reverse happy hour sushi there.  The food is really good. Though it's a burger restaurant, I would say the hamburger, though good, is the least tasty option on the menu. This is literally the only place where I order the turkey burger over the hamburger. The spice blended into the turkey is excellent, and they load plenty of avocados on top. The veggie sandwich is a crowdpleaser and the mozerella and tomato sandwich/salad is also delicious. They recently added sushi to the menu and it is passable, but not particularly memorable.   The fries are the True stars of the show. I would absolutely recommend the mixed regular and sweet potato fries. They hare served with tasty aioli and ketchup.  They are delivered in mini shopping carts, which is a nice touch (and always puts a smile on new diners' faces).   The beer selection is a bit disappointing and overpriced, and rather than the hagen dasz milkshakes, I'd recommend walking across the lot to the nearby Gelato Spot.",

    "text": "Delux is different, yeah it's different ...  Think outdoor pool club scene meets Niman Prime Angus gourmet burgers on Ciabatta meets sushi meets retro bakery menu. Sound weird? More like a True condensed description of Delux if you ask me.  To be honest I bookmarked Delux, because i love me a good burger and the little shopping cart holding the fries here are just so darn adorable- hey, what can I say I'm a sucker for cute packaging and eccentric food presentation.  I decided to go for their signature Delux burger and had a bottle of Kirin to share with my roomie- don't judge it was Happy Hour and the bottle was only $7.  Delux Burger- Fresh ground, all-natural, grain fed, niman ranch certified premium beef, caramelized onion & small bits of applewood smoked bacon, a blend of gruyere & maytag bleu cheeses & topped with baby arugula. served on a toasted, handcrafted demi-baguette (seems more like a ciabatta to me)  This is hardly a burger, if anything it's a burger for two. Comes in a demi baguette so it's in a strange oblong sandwich shape, nonetheless it is damn good! I got my patty medium- well and the beef was tender, juicy and had that signature niman ranch flavor. The cheese wasn't strong in bleu cheese and the touch of carmelized onions added a good sweetness. The arugula gave it a kick of pepper, but slightly and the bread was substantial enough to hold this huge burger all together without getting soggy.  Really good burger though I would say if you're a small gal like me share a burger with a friend and share an app as well. I ate only half of my burger and took the other half home and was stuff with the beer and all.   The environment was awesome to be in and service was good. A bit pricey, but for a gourmet burger this good- it's well worth it.",

Not once were we asked how things were....I would have sent the mahi sandwich back, no one cares to even ask why I left it on my plate. Water glasses never filled and overall poor customer service, very tragic as I think they have potential. $112 for us to leave hungry and had dinner at separate times! 2 thumbs down!",

It was so dark in there, I had to use my cell phone to be able to read the menu.  Not a deal breaker.  But it was so cold in the restaurant, I had put on my jacket and eat my dinner in it.

Employees are usually nice and give great service. The only slightly bad thing about this place is that they get really busy at night, especially the weekends...probably because everyone knows how good they are! So if you go at any peak time, expect to wait a little bit. They can usually seat a 2-4 party in 15-20 minutes if they're swamped.

I also love that they're open until 2AM (at least on weekends... I'm not sure about weekdays).    I cannot post a review about Delux without recommending both the Delux burger and sweet potato fries.  The burger has always been cooked medium-rare, as ordered (don't hunt me down if they mess yours up), and the fries are worthy of being served at the Pearly Gates.  Said another way, I USED to think The Vig Uptown had the best sweet spuds in town.    I can also vouch for the beet salad and Chinese chicken salad.  Oh, and the Haagen Dazs strawberry shake/malt thing will make your messy divorce seem like a lighthearted disagreement.  And before you complain about the $6 price tag, remember how much your divorce lawyer cost you...  They also serve sushi now, and although I won't go anywhere near it (I was born this way!), I did sample my friend's Vegas roll, and...yeah... why don't you try those too.    The reason I award 4 and not 5 stars is because I find the service to be inconsistent.  Sometimes it can be great, and other times, I feel like my server would rather be anywhere else.  Considering that I eat out alone a lot, an absent or bland server can ruin a dining experience for me.  Don't project your bad day onto me, please.  Ain't nobody got time for that!",

I'm a sucker for sweet potato fries, and Delux does great sweet potato fries. The house aioli is great, I recommend the mixed basket of sweet potato and regular fries. If you still have room after that, get the float made with the stout. Happy Hour's good, everything's good!",

But damnit if they don't have a tasty burger and fries.  Well constructed with great flavor and texture combinations.  Their delux burger is unequivocally delicious and, at least the one I was served tonight, perfectly cooked to my specified temperature.  I comment about this because far too few places get the basics correct.  Delux did tonight.",

BEST BURGER IN ALL ARIZONA, and probably one of the best i had anywhere outside arizona. theres a reason this burger keeps winning best burger in az. their Delux Burger is just delicious. The meat is melt in your mouth(make sure to order medium rare, otherwise you cant get the full benefits) two people can eat from one, and im a 6'1 guy so i could have enough with half. I would choose sweet potatoe over regular fries.   *****Once you try this burger you wont be able to enjoy others, as you will always compare it to this(just keep in mind, theres fast food, pub burgers and then there's Gourmet Burgers, Delux being gourmet; you cant put others in the same line.   AVG burger price: $11 fries: $5 or $6",

I must really need to get laid if that last sentence about a thick hamburger sounded sexual to me.  Anyway, besides the thickness factor, the hamburger was delicious-- medium rare, melty Gruyere cheese, bacon and onions cooked together in what makes a gooey, slightly sweet BBQ-like sauce.  I also partook in one of the beer flights... and then I partook in my friend's beer flight because I forced him to get one even though he doesn't like beer (Insuring that I would end up with two beer flights-- nothing in life is random, wait, everything in life is random... I'm confused.  How about nothing in life is random where beer is concerned?).  The sweet potato fries were soft. I like a little more crunch in my fry. Who wants a flaccid fry? Not me. I could bend them in all sorts of shapes, none of which were useful.    I think I liked the ambiance more than the food, but the food was good too. Or maybe I had too much beer and this review, tainted with sexual innuendos, is worthless. Either way, a must try.        P.S. I hope people I only know in passing never read this.",

I am not complaining about it by any means, but it just didn't knock my socks off. Our order included the signature burger, sweet potato fries, and the chicken salad sandwich. The fries were great. The burger was well constructed, though the temperature was a bit over the medium rare that I ordered (this is also how they recommend it). I'm not surprised as the patty was probably only half an inch thick. It was still juicy and the flavor was fine. The chicken salad sandwich was gargantuan, but its contents were a bit lacking of flavor and the chicken was a touch on the dry side.  All in all, it's certainly worth a shot if you've never tried it. I didn't really see the value in it at the moderately high prices so I doubt it will come to mind when deciding on where to eat, but maybe it'll do it for you.",

This time I had a waitress that seemed distracted (yeah you, the one who was working this Saturday afternoon) And didn't smile much or was having internal conversations while she was dropping utensils and clashing plates.  She was preoccupied when she took my order and totally forgot my fries...wasn't even on the bill.  I don't know, when a burger waitress forgets fries orders she should be fired.  She apologized when I told her and she said she was just looking out for my diet.  Cute, but where is the incentive to come back?  I mean forgetting fries with a burger is pretty obscene.  She pissed me off so much I don't want to go back for a while. I guess my point is that service doesn't represent the individual but the restaurant as a whole.  If they hire people who have no understanding of customer satisfaction and they are no longer representing the restaurant but only themselves, then it means the restaurant is slipping as they are no longer managing service.  This waitress clearly was not representing the restaurant, or even aware she was working. The decline of good consistent service is a bad sign.",

    "text": "Okay so Delux needs to revoke whatever ill-conceived licensing agreement they entered into with the cretins over at the airport. That \"Delux\" burger--if you can even call that wretched mass a burger--was the absolute worst single thing I have ever consumed in my whole entire life. The free burgers they give you at this boat-shaped strip club in south Tucson on Fridays far exceeded the \"Delux\" burger in both quality and taste.   The real Delux burger is quite good. In fact, its one of my favorites. So, when I sunk my unwitting teeth into this sham and discovered it's pre-frozen mass-produced patties, cheap-ass American cheese, McDonald's tomatoes, stale \"Brioche\" bun, and conspicuous lack of a tasty condiment capable of masking the mess, you can probably imagine my soul-crushing disappointment.   This thing costs like $14, which is more expensive than a real Delux burger if I recall. I'll never see my poor $14 again. My poor $14 is now in the hands of some godless heathen who's probably reinvesting it to buy licenses from other unsuspecting local business owners. I should be reimbursed that $14 to pay for the colon cleanse I'm gonna need in an hour. My sad, sad anus...   This experience, suffice it to say, has taught me that there is no justice in this world. What's happening over here at Sky Harbor needs to stop ASAP. I am posting this to the actual Delux page to raise awareness, and politely urge the owners of Delux to put this to an end.",

Honestly, I am salivating like Pavlov's dog just writing this review. Crap... now I'm starving.  Go. Get the burger. You'll thank me later.",

The place does fill up fast, so I prefer to go there on off-hours, especially during the reverse happy hour. The bartenders are very friendly.  The burgers are large and tasty. The fries are some of the best I have ever had. The bar is well-stocked with a large variety of beers, wines, and spirits. I tried a hot dog at Delux once and thought it was good, but I suggest sticking with the burger and fries.",

    "text": "Delux sounded really good, so I decided to grab a burger for an early lunch.  I had heard from others that it was really good.   The service was excellent and for that alone, I give Delux 5 stars however..  I ordered a cup of coffee $2.50,  a half order of sweet potato and regular fries $3.5 and the delux burger with bacon and avocado $10.90 (typo in the menu it said $9.90) and $1.50 for the bacon and avocado. It was over $21, crazy!  The bill was high for what I got I think , compared to other restaurants, definitely not worth it.   Fries, awesome, in the top 5 for best sweet potato fries but not the best in town, sorry, I do have my favorites!  The burger was not a tasty as I imagined it to be.  Yes, it was fresh, but it wasn't that tasty even with the extra bacon and avocado, and usually I devour burgers if they are good regardless of the size, this one I didn't.   Delux has a wonderful outside venue and is a great place to hang with friends and maybe share a burger and fries, but I wasn't blown away as I thought I would be.  I gave the restaurant a 3 because of pricing and just the taste of the burger, it wasn't that great.",

    "text": "I was pretty excited to go to Delux, and had been meaning to try it for some time, but I finally got around to it this last weekend.  I'd heard how great their burgers were and that if you wanted to spend a little more than the average to get a fantastic burger, that was the place to go.    So, off we went to give it a shot.  We got there at around 6 or 6:30 on Saturday and the place was pretty busy, although there was no wait.  We were seated at the tables along the west wall.  Talk about an awkward entry onto the booth side.  The tables are so close together, there's no graceful in or out.   To the table next to me... I'm so sorry I invaded your space.  Some other reviewers have said it was loud, boy were they right.  It was quite noisy and crowded, even the servers had trouble getting around the people & I did hear 1 tray of dishes hit the ground.    On to the ordering... 1/2 the menu is drinks.  From beers to wines, they have you covered & I appreciated the options.  Food menu is small to average, but a decent selection of items. My boyfriend & I opted to both go for the Delux Burger.  Can't go wrong with the namesake, right?  High quality beef with arugula and a blend of cheeses, onions, and bacon.  mmmmm ... bacon.    As we waited anxiously for the tasty treats, I got nervous. I heard the woman next to me say, \"I seem to be missing my bacon\".  I saw her pull her burger apart, searching, and no bacon.  I was hoping it was a one time oversight and that my burger would come with bacon, as promised.  Not so.  Both my boyfriend and I were lacking our bacon.  Our server was just attentive enough to not be MIA, but if I'd waited for him to come back so that I could point out my lack of yummy pork product, I'd have been sitting another 15 minutes with food in front of me that, although lacking a bit, was fairly tasty.    This brings me to the fries.  Everyone keeps posting how fantastic the sweet potato fries were.  Um, yeah, average at best.  We got the 1/2 and 1/2 basket and both types were limp and bland.  They were only cooked to the point of being 'just done'.  No crispiness.  It made me sad.  Oh, and I have to throw this in, when asked if we wanted desert, we politely declined & said we were all set.  Apparently, that is server code for, \"No more fries for you!\".  Yup, he snatched up that basket of fries without asking if we were done.   All in all, I didn't hate it, but wow, I sure was hoping for something better.  You know, that gem of a place that you get a craving for.  Maybe it's like that blockbuster movie that you've heard so many good things about, you can't wait to see it, but it's been so built up that it winds up being a let down.  I'm not sure if it was an off night, but I'm also not sure I'll go back.",

Our server (if you can call him that -- he was more like an entitled lump expecting a tip), Christian never came back to check on us, offer refills or ask about dessert. I had to practically ambush him like a guerrilla warrior to get him to bring me the check. After that we waited another 10 minutes for him to run my card, even though the patio was empty.  The food was OK,but nothing memorable or extraordinary.  I'd sooner eat McDonald's Dollar Menu burgers then spend money here again.  Just a waste or my time and money.",

The burger and sushi we got were good but nothing you couldn't get at a fraction of the price at several other establishments nearby. The service we got was deplorable. Our drinks sat empty most of the time, the servers were standing around joking not paying any attention and they put both charges for our bill on one card instead of splitting it between the two like we had asked. We had to call and get it taken off by our bank. Won't be back to this place.",

I know it may sound strange, but they combined the two separate restaurants and turned them into one. Highly recommend the sweet potatoes fries. They are thin sliced with the perfect amount of crunch to them. Plus it comes with ketchup and spicy mayo for dipping. Also, if you are going for a vegetarian option, the vegetable panini was on point and filling. The waiter was awesome! He was super kind, knew the menu VERY well, and offered add-ons options (ex: Asian chicken panini instead of the regular chicken because the Asian chicken one is marinated in orange juice and saki - and even throwing some avocado in there). Kudos to your Ryan for being knowledgeable about the restaurant! I feel like I would come back to this place especially since they are open late everyday and they have something going on everyday of the week (Sunday's is tequila Sunday!)",

    "text": "Went here tonight for my first time after a long shift at work. Thankfully they're open till 2am and I didn't have to settle for fast food. I was so ready to order a bunch of sushi when I found out the sushi bar isn't open as late as the restaurant on weekdays. Bummed. But not a big deal.  So I browsed the rest of the menu and decided on the Chinese chicken salad (I think it was called) and the delux burger with sweet potato fries and regular fries mixed. Salad was a nice size and very very tasty. The burger came out shortly after along with a side of some kind of sauce and ketchup. The sauce was orangeish in color and looked like spicy mayo, and let me tell you it was AMAAAAAZING with the sweet potato fries. I couldn't have been more pleased with the food.  The very best part of my visit, however, was when Lenny, the owner came over to casually say hello and introduce himself which is such a nice touch to a dining experience, I believe. We chatted for about ten minutes. He's owned restaurants before and he's been in the business for a very long time, and it shows through this restaurant. I was impressed that he was there so late, it really shows that he puts a lot of time and effort into his place.   Needless to say, I 100% recommend this place, not only for the great quality and taste of the food, but to support local business! I will be back soon to try the sushi. :)",

Order from the late night happy hour with margarita (frozen and on the rocks) along with some sushi (from Zen) and the 2 slider burgers!!!

Narrow chic restaurant that reminds me of living in NY where the coolest restaurants are small dark and narrow. Good use of space but NOT a fan of the long Island table in the center with non moveable stools, you could potentially be shoulder to shoulder with a complete stranger. Everyone tonight had the Delux burger which they all were satisfied, I HAD to go with the grilled cheese my \"go to\" it is one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I have had in my life, fresh bread and it is almost like a tomato basil salad complete with mozzarella and a blend of other cheeses (perfection) it's so colorful and fresh you'd swear it was healthy. Fries both sweet potato or regular delicious! With great aioli which we kept dipping and dipping until my friend and I noticed a \"glow\" at the bottom of the dip cup from the glowing table.......it was a HOLE in the bottom, I don't know how that got past chef prep but it wasn't a huge deal just \"things that make you go hmmmm\".",

    "text": "I placed a pick up order today at 7:01pm for two Chinese chicken salads. I was quoted 15-20 minutes for the food to be ready and might I add the person I spoke with on the phone was less that polite or nice. I arrive at 7:16pm to the curb side pick up and call to let them know I was there. The same person I spoke with earlier answered the phone and said \"oh it's not ready and you can come inside to get it.\" I said no I'll get wait out here thanks. So now it's 7:26pm and still no food or anything. At this point I am very annoyed. So my aunt calls this time to see what happened with our order and still the order isn't ready. So at this point we both go inside and ask to speak with the manager. I don't remember the managers name, I think it may have been Jared. Anyways I explain to him THREE times what the situation was and yet he still was confused. I was even showing him my phone with the times the order was placed, yet he still had a super confused look on his face. He then shows us the order ticket that he or someone else just placed at 7:27pm!!!!!! I was absolutely appalled. I was like \"what?!? I placed the order at 7:01, called at 7:16 and NOW the order is only being made?! I don't understand!\" Instead of apologizing he said he will comp only salad and only charge for a jr for the other one but we still had to wait. We have now both lost our appetite and say \"forget the salads we are leaving, you could have at least been open and honest with us that someone dropped the ball and forgot to place the order BOTH times we called or even just said sorry.\"   Our family has been coming to this restaurant for 10 years and this was extremely disappointing. I actual don't even live in this state anymore and visiting from the Bay Area so I tried to make it a point to visit one of my favorite restaurants but I will no longer return. The poor service is not worth the food and we will take our business else where.   Come here/ order at your own risk -- you may leave disappointed like we were.",

The sushi was way better than I anticipated; I thought it was weird this being a burger place but everything we had was bomb. Try the tiger roll! The fries are a must have. The drink menu is ok- they could have better options. Overall a good experience & their open late which is nice too!",

I was first given mixed fries but had to wait another 7 mins for the right fries but lost my appetite by then.  Among other things,  my glass of water was empty and never got a refill.

I LOVE the fact that no matter how late it is, Delux seems to always be open (at least for an old person like me).   I LOVE the fact that the restaurant caters to different appetites. Feel like sushi? No prob. Feel like a hamburger from grass fed beef locally grown. No prob. Feel fat? No prob, order a tasty salad. You won't go wrong!  I LOVE the fact that the location is so convenient to home, and the parking lot is big enough to find a place to park.  I had my first Lindeman Framboise here. So, refreshing! There are a lot of beer options on tap, so you'll likely find something you like.   The beet salad was excellent and I'd definitely order it again. Full size, no prob. Just keep me away from those addictive fries!",

I spent $40 on takeout sushi that would cost me $15 in (Washington) DC in a high end grocery. Maybe $25 in a restaurant.  Just to be clear - DC is not a cheap place, and sushi is not cheap food in DC.   Delux sushi tasted like grocery store sushi too.  Like crappy grocery store sushi. The crab meat was tasteless imitation crabmeat, the avocado was hard and unripe, the rice was stale, a lot of the fish was rubbery.. the spicy tuna was tasteless and not spicy.. etc. I could go on and on.  Finally the rolls were small. Sorry guys, but small rolls + crappy fish + stale rice + $$$$ is not a great formula for sushi.  I could understand either:  - big rolls + crappy food + $$$$  or - small rolls + decent food + $$$$  but not small rolls + crap + $$$$  (FWIW I ordered the rainbow roll and the tiger roll, as well as seaweed salad.)",

    "text": "My other half and I were in the Phoenix area and really craving burgers, so we decided to stop by here for a late lunch. First impressions were a bit strange - I'd never heard of a sushi/burger place, but we were willing to give it a try.   I had a few complaints, for example the restaurant itself was very dimly lit and rather dark, so I had to hold the menu closer to my face to be able to read it. The bathrooms were a bit of an atrocity as well - single-person bathrooms, with the sinks out in the hallway?! Even with just a couple people waiting in line and an employee restocking the paper towels it was very cramped and awkward to move around in that tiny little hallway, so unless or until they expand and revamp their facilities make sure you use the bathroom before you leave the house.  Moving on - we were seated in the sushi half of the restaurant because upon arriving we were undecided if we'd be ordering a roll or two, which we didn't, but on the television screens above the sushi bar they were playing my favorite anime, Shokugeki no Soma (Food Wars), which I got a huge kick out of! I'll admit, I had a small fan-girl moment. It was a shame they were playing it without audio or subtitles, since I would've really enjoyed to actually watch and listen to it, but it was still an interesting and nice surprise nonetheless.  As for our food, I ordered a grilled cheese panini, which at first didn't seem like it would be enough for a meal but it was actually very tasty and filling. My boyfriend ordered one of their signature burgers, which he let me have a few bites of, and it was equally delicious.  Now, here's the story of the day: We had ordered a basket of fries to split when we ordered our entrees, and our sandwiches had arrived first. Our waitress, who was rather young and slightly ditzy but polite and friendly, said the fries would be out shortly, which was fine - and sure enough just a few minutes later we could see in the little window between the kitchen and the restaurant was our fries sitting there waiting. But unfortunately, we never got those fries... as we were eating our sandwiches we watched multiple times as our waitress stopped by the window to chat with the chef, with our fries INCHES FROM HER FACE but she still left them there and never brought them to us. It wasn't until after we finished our entrees and we were sitting there a bit disappointed with our now-cold fries still in sight at the window, our waitress finally stopped and asked \"Wait, did you guys ever get your fries?\" Uh... as our server that should be something you would know? But to her credit she was very embarrassed and apologetic at her mistake, so not only did she place a new order for fresh fries for us at no charge, but she also took the original fries and an additional 10% off our bill. While it shouldn't have happened in the first place, I'm very glad the waitress went above and beyond to fix her mistake and make sure we left happy. That's why even with the mistakes and minor complaints, the excellent food and mended mistake gets 4 stars from me. We'll definitely be back sometime in the future when we wants burgers or sushi - but hopefully they don't forget our fries next time!",

Seriously. Looking at the photos from last night is making me crave a burger now.  At breakfast time. (Ok, so I started writing this review before breakfast. Fast forward many, many hours later today and I'm still craving another one!)  My super awesome fella suggested this place 1) for their impressive beer list (yes!) 2) food 3) service factor. Although I numbered them these items should be weighted equally. Yes, I like dark beers. (And so should everyone. But that's a different topic;)  There are two very different sections to this restaurant. We sat on the \"sushi/pick-up/to-go\" side in a booth. If you can swing a booth I'd recommend that.  The hostess offered us a round of free drinks if we sat in the main area. (Where the bar is.) I've heard the following from my fella and my brunch friends. (This could be a yay or nay for some, I didn't personally experience.)   The chairs are bolted down to floor and the tables are, perhaps, a bit, on the close side. Sounds like fun for socializing to me! (Or a stretch to have an intimate moment.)  I'm very gung ho to return given how efficiently and seamlessly our order was processed. And (obviously) the food. Even tho the beer menu has recently changed our server* knew her stuff!  My drink of choice was a \"Delux Youngsberry\". This is delightful mix of chocolate stout with framboise. Hoh. So. Good!   On the sushi side there are these hypnotic TVs with an ocean theme. The bummer is all four of them are dedicated to sea worthy endeavors. There are two other TVs to watch sports (but those must be tuned to the same game).  This is a great place for groups of four and under. (I would say the space can't handle more tho.)  * I wish I had written down our server's name. (You'll love her!) Keep an eye out for her / you can't miss her. Pitch black straight hair, slightly longer than chin length with blunt bangs.  She's the bomb!",

    "text": "My boss has been picking all of the restaurants while we've been in Phoenix (and to his credit, they've all been pretty awesome) but today I was told to find us something for lunch. Fortunately, there's this nifty website called Yelp where I was able to find a place that had both burgers and sushi, thus hedging my bet.  Upon arrival, we were informed that sushi was only available at night, which kind of bummed Boss Man out - he was secretly hoping for some sort of sashimi burger creation, but it was not to be. He had to settle for the Delux Burger which was served on a brioche bun and topped with any number of things. Given the speed at which he dispatched it, I assume it was very good.  Because I am forever in search of a decent turkey burger I had to sample Delux's version. It was legit - a thick, juicy, well seasoned patty that was full of flavor and topped with fresh avocado slices. It was everything I hoped it would be.  Service was prompt and pleasant and the tab was reasonable. Four stars for the best turkey burger I've had in a long while.",

    "text": "Location: The restaurant  itself is really cute. I like that it's tucked into its own little corner, makes you forget you're in a strip mall area. Small patio but probably 7 tables. The two doors with different signs is a bit misleading it's all one establishment. Seems like over kill. 4  Service: Upon arrival the door was held open for me by the hostess. She was very friendly and smiled as I passed though. I was then greeted by the other hoatess she inquired about number of people in my party and promptly  took me to my table, by the door on the to go side. Not the most ideal seat at first but turned out to be nice as many people don't use that door. I was quickly greeted by our server, Patrick,  with menus. In told him I would look at them  and wait for my friend to arrive before ordering. He brought waters by soon. He was knowledgeable but he did talk a lot more than I would have wished and at the  end he said, \" I'd offer you two dessert but you ate plenty already so  I doubt you need it\". I was shocked. ALWAYS OFFER. I was on a date and it was like damn, is he calling me fat?? 3.5  Food: We only did sushi. It was good. Nothing memorable but good.  Writing this review a few days after and honestly can't tell you what I ordered. I love sushi and ate it again recently and can tell you every roll! So it was basic at best. 3   Presentation: food was presented neatly and quickly wait time was not long. Drinks wet offered once. Both  had a glass of wine. 4  We were satisfied when we left the restaurant.   I'd like to give a 3.5 due to service and food but I will go to a 4 because service change easily. Also, because I didn't try the burger and it's what they really are known for.",

The burger lacked flavor, even with all the toppings including caramelized onions.  Nothing popped when you would bite into it, and even the bun was a little soggy.  I would go to In and Out and get a tasty burger for a better price before going back.  OR, stop in at Blu Burger for a tastier burger at the same price.",

    "text": "Delux vaguely irritates me and I can't quite figure out why. It might be that because since it has opened, Phoenix magazine has breathlessly stroked it with loving essay after loving essay, complete with pictures, all of which painstakingly include its one gimmick, a miniature shopping cart to deliver french fries in. Still, sometimes you want a good burger, and last night was one of those sometimes, so we decided to head over to Delux at long last and check it out. Have you ever thought to yourself \"ha ha, if there is one thing I know for sure in this world, it is that a glorified hamburger joint could never have a menu that could be considered pretentious?\" If so, it is clear that you haven't been to Delux. The menu, six pages long, devotes one half of one page to its two hamburgers (signature and classic), one and a half pages to other food and four pages to various types of booze you've never heard of. In the food section, their ground beef, its origin and the manner in which it is prepared is described regally, using language clearly designed to indicate that you should be thankful you only have to pay ten bucks for it!  OK, so what of it? It's the Biltmore, I knew I was facing up a ten-dollar burger, so STFU and get on with it, right? Well there's no getting around it. This is a damned fine hamburger. It's not often that you will get to a place where it's menu SUGGESTS that their burgers are best served medium rare - rather than suggesting that if you get it medium rare there's a chance you could DIE. This one simple fact more than any other made me certain that Delux isn't just flapping its gums about the origin of their meat. They know where it comes from and are close enough to it to suggest that you can have it prepared in a manner that might put you in the hospital if you were dealing with commercial ground beef. They deserve a lot of kudos for this. I had their classic burger with American cheese (because blue cheese and carmelized onions, found on their \"signature\" burger - are not my thing on a hamburger). I had it medium rare. It was absolutely fantastic, easily the best burger I've had in this city. So there. I said it. The shopping cart is cute if non-sequitur. The regular fries were merely OK. I liked the sweet potato fries better than I thought I would, but the suggestion that a lot of yelpers have made that they are the second coming is a tad overblown.  The service was absolutely great, but I doubt that my experience could be considered a test case, because we were there off-peak and there were more employees present than patrons. Seriously, the place can't be any bigger than 1500 square feet, and I counted nine employees! Plus one for helping out the local economy, but minus several million for efficiency?   All in all, this place is too full of itself, but you can't argue with the end result. When I want a good burger, I'll be back.",

The weird to-go store is just a waste of space and would serve much better as extra sitting room for the the main restaurant.

Liked the fries (served in a mini-shopping cart) and their accompanying orange concoction, but the burgers were bland.  The outdoor seating area, with its view of the mini-mall parking lot, was less than glamorous.    One redeeming characteristic, aside from the manageable price, was the gazpacho, which was relatively delicious.  Would order, again, but that's about it.  A bit overrated.  Wheelchair friendly on the aforementioned patio, but not so much around the high bar table troughs inside.  *Been here a couple more times and feel like the food is at least dependable, and the attitude is kept at a minimum.  Deserves and extra star or two more than my original review because it's the kind of place that you don't love, but that you can comfortably hang out at for awhile w/ your friends, yapping it up.

We were starving.  As we walked in, all eyes were on us.  I want to say it's because we were 7 hot chicks, but honestly, I think it was because were 7 hot ASIAN chicks.  I think they were all impressed by how well we spoke English.  Ha ha.  Good times!  We had a little wait before being seated but it wasn't bad at all.  There just isn't an area to stand around because the joint is cozy.  But the decor is beautifully chic and totally fun.  We sat in the middle aisle which is set at bar level.  The stools (hence no place to hang your bag) are pinned to the ground so you can't group together with your friends but it's kinda good that way.  You're forced to step out of your comfort zone and sit a little closer to the guy next to you whom you never would have been so close to before.  I almost wanted to eat the fries off his plate.  Ha ha.    Speaking of fries, they were delish!  And the dipping sauces... one was ketchup but the other one... a most wonderful spicy mayo type creamy thing.  I had to save some to lather on my burger as well.  I had the Delux Burger, of course.  This wonderfully fantastic fat raw (but in a good way) burger was SO good, despite being full I finished the whole thing with a break in between.  Our waiter, this adorably gay blonde and outgoing boy, asked me how I wanted it cooked then proceeded to tell me it had to be medium/medium rare.  I'm glad I trusted him.    I had never thought of having a glass of wine with a burger before but I must say, the Ravenswood \"Icon\" Syrah was excellent!  The wine itself was delicious but with the USDA Choice all-natural, grainfed, Certified 4 Diamond Angus Beef it was to die for.  ^_^  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.deluxburger.com%2F&s=f702892244356da88c28078bcde66b44c538da3d3a4c4ef54c8d5019d43a4222\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">deluxburger.com</a>",

    "text": "To remix the legendary \"Spinal Tap\" aphorism, Delux \"does for 'the burger' what 'The Sound of Music' did for hills\" - that is to make them bold, fresh, modern, and delicious.   Pros: Original, fresh menu - Great Beer selection (all microbrews from across the states) - Very stylish, vibrant, contemporary decor - and (an odd one) the bathrooms are incredible.   Delux boasts a fresh and clean aesthetic in the design of the space and the quality of its food. From burgers to sandwiches to soups, salads, and deserts, the quality and originality of Delux's recipes are evident from the first bite.  Everything I've tasted here (on my numerous visits) has been unique, and most definitely \"worth writing home\" about.   Entrees are $6 - $10 and served a la carte (sans fries or salad). Fries are available (in regular, sweet potato, or a combination), and are $3 for a half order, $6 for a full (more than enough to share). Known for their burgers, Delux also serves many other sandwiches and paninis including a chicken panini, a grilled cheese version, and a vegetarian panini(chock-full of deliciousness).  I've had just about every one, and they're all great. As an added bonus, the menu incorporates an extensive selection of beers from microbreweries across the US, along with a wine menu and a fully stocked bar.   But I think what really sets Delux apart as a destination more than just a place with tasty food is the design. Delux's design is fashion-forward, with a long bar-height table with diffused neon blue light emanating from it anchoring the room, repeating themes of mirrors and stainless steel, and numerous architectural elements to mirror and mimic the light around the room.  It's design probably steals elements from several nightclubs and lounges around town, and translates them into a unique and chic hotspot for dinner.  Con's: (only 1) Delux is a small restaurant which fills up quickly. Can be at least a 10 min wait if you have more than two people.",

The burger was fine, but not the BEST I've ever had.  The burger was not much better than something you might get at Chilis, Red Robin Cheeburger, Cheeburger etc (my opinion). I think I actually would prefer a burger from these places over Delux.  Maybe my expectations for this place and burger were set too high and I was disappointed with the final product.  Pros: The sweet potato fries and dipping sauce was very good. The service was excellent.  Cons: Limited seating and basically rubbing shoulders with the person next to you because you are packed in so tight. T the lighting in the bathroom is very dark. I'm shocked techno wasn't being played when I walked in. I didn't like the trendy nightclub feel of this place.",

Good service, Great Food, Outstanding Beer selection. You really can't go wrong. It is True it does get crowd but it is worth the wait and everyone know it. My recommendation is to go late night after the bar and have another drink with a great burger and fries.",

    "text": "I recently moved away from Phoenix and can easily say Delux is 1 of the top 5 things I miss about that city. We ordered from Delux 2 go at least 3 or 4 times a month. The service was always consistent and we rarely ran into issues with our order. You can get just about anything off of the regular Delux menu to go. I do agree with others that the sweet potato fries can be soggy. We usually avoided soggy fries by telling our order taker that we had issues with soggy fries in the past and wanted to prevent that from happening again. The Delux burger is THE best twist on the conventional burger I have ever experienced and is best when prepared medium rare.   The sweet potato fries are a must with any meal and you always have to ask for extra secret Delux sauce. That stuff is good on ANYTHING!",

The signature Delux Burger with sweet potato fries are absolutely mouth watering. The little added novelty of the sweet potato's coming in a mini grocery cart was also a nice touch accompanied by a nice aioli sauce to dip in. Now I'm not a fan of onions, let alone grilled onions by all means, but the waiter talked me into them and I'm glad he did. The carmelized onions were a nice texture touch to the burger and infused the burger with more flavor.   After what I felt like, was inhaling my delicious burger, we had a apple cinnamon cookie with a glass of milk. Such a great finish to a great burger. A nice 'fancy' touch to comfort food indeed.",

    "text": "It was my first time visiting Phoenix (I'm from LA), and I had just paid $10 for a pair of unbelievable Canali (Italian made) jeans at the nearby Last Chance.  That, coupled with drastically cheaper gas I'd just filled my tank with, and you can only imagine the love-for-everything-Phoenix high I was riding as I entered Delux with my native-born girlfriend.  The restaurant was nicely decorated with a slightly modern/upscale feel to it.  The prices were extremely CHEAP. The burger (I put my faith in the Delux burger) was unbelievable.  Truly a treat,  Not to mention their generous portions of fries,  The cart was convenient for rolling back and forth between my girlfriend and I, and it also created the illusion of containing less delicious sweet potato/regular cut fries than it actually did.  Not to mention the great thousand island that was served in a sauce dish along with the burger and its nicely plated garnish.  My girlfriend ordered the Vegetable Panini (after threatening to order a regular green salad for 10 dollars at the burger place she bragged about) at the last minute, and I was irate with her after she continued to ask for bites of my burger and expressed disappointment with her sandwich (which I later thought was pretty good after trying it, but nothing compared to the burger).  The bad part: Our server was absolutely terrible.  Maybe he had something going on in his life, maybe he's just a poor server, but we deserved more attentive service than we received.  It all seemed to stop after our food came, without so much as a water refill.  However, all around great, upscale burgers at good prices.  I will definitely be back.",

I ordered the Delux Burger medium rare which was cooked perfectly, moist and flavorful.  I also ordered the mixed basket of french fries and sweet potato fries which comes in a novel \"mini shopping cart\".  The only thing cooler would have been if we were able to take it home as a souvenir.  The fries were also cooked perfectly, not too oily but crispy with a nice subtle sweetness on the sweet potato fries.  The staff was also very friendly and expedient and they have a huge selection of beers on tap.  The only downside I can think of would be the price, which isn't exorbitant but also isn't the cheapest burger you're going to eat.  Still, the quality of the food and the excellent service have me giving Delux an emphatic 2 thumbs up.",

When I finally got back home the bun was soggy and was luke warm, but even through all the faults I could taste that I was in love. If a soggy burger can get me going I know this place is fantastic.

    "text": "I arrived before my friend, so the hostess was going to seat me while I waited.  I looked around and my first impression was that it was very modern decor, very trendy.  The tables to the left were along one long booth bench, then had a chair across from it.  There was a long table in the center with BOLTED stools along it, and then there was the bar.  The only table left was next to a couple with two very loud toddlers, and since the tables were so close together, we'd be almost sitting on top of each other, I opted for the long center table.  After sitting there for about two minutes, I was looking for somewhere else to sit.  VERY uncomfortable.  When I friend arrived, she sat there for an even shorter amount of time and said the same thing .... we have to sit somewhere else.  There happen to be a table open (a few down from the toddlers) so we opted to sit there.  Again, the tables were soooo close together, that we had to move the table over so that she could get through to sit down!    Now for the food ...  we happen to order the same thing, the Cool Caprese Panini.  As other reviewers have said, if you want any sides, they are all extra.  Since the panini was already almost $10, we opted for no sides.  The panini was very good, fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, basil and some kind of herb paste (I think).  The warm grilled roll was also very good.  It came with a small container of vinegar/oil, and two separate cups with salt and pepper.    It came with some fruit, about 5 small pieces to be exact.  If I were really hungry, I probably would have hit the vending machine when I got back to work.  Forgot to mention, it was FREEZING in there.  We sat close to the door, and it actually felt good when someone opened the door to let the 105 degree air in.  So, if you not very hungry, don't mind over paying for what you get, and don't care if you are comfortable while you are eating, you might enjoy this place.",

We then shared some sweet potato fries and normal fries, good, but just fries.  I'm a sucker for a loaded burger that isn't cooked to death and that's what I got here.  There were other aspects of the place I wasn't able to sample (the beer journeys, for one thing...being pregnant has it's downfalls), they had some really interesting beer picks up there, I was salivating just at the thought of some of them.  If you have a taste for something more than Bud, Miller or the usual watery junk you should check this place out just for thier selection of craft beers.",

When it comes to burgers, I firmly believe that they should be held as their own separate food group, right along with Pizza, Beer, and Burritos....so you can only imagine how excited I was to try this place, as it was voted Best Burger in Phoenix Magazine.  There was no wow factor.  None.  So, to anyone who reads this review, please tell me what I am missing?  Because, to be honest with you, all I tasted was a piece of unseasoned beef, on a bun, with some fresh tomato, lettuce, and red onion.  What set's the place apart?!  What makes this place amazing?    The only thing that I can say that was good about this place is that they didn't use the same interior designer that Blu Burger does.",

    "text": "I ate here the other day as a last minute \"I'm early for my appointment and am super hungry\" thing.  Glad I stopped by.  The seating? Meh. It's a bit crowded, and I sat at the community table. The purse hooks are nice, but sitting on a stool for an hour long meal was not good for my back, and my shoulders cried out in pain.  The menu is good; however, online they tell you if the soups are vegetarian/vegan. They don't mention it on the in-store menu. Good thing I'd looked it up, and that my server (Meschelle) knew her stuff.  I was in a bit of a hurry and not ready for a whole sandwich, so I got the gazpacho and an order of sweet potato fries.  Which come with ketchup and a house aoili, but the server let me know it had mayo in it, which means eggs.  So instead, she brought me ketchup and a nice mustard (they have 4 kinds) for dipping. I appreciated that a lot, and also her asking me about whether I wanted the goat cheese that came on my soup or not.  The fries? Delicious. Some of the best sweet potato fries I've ever been blessed to try.  I may come back just for those.  But then, I had my soup? Oh! It wasn't anything like what I'd imagined (it was way more chunky, and more like a tomato salsa than a traditional gazpacho), but it came with goat cheese and avocado on top, and it was to DIE for. So freaking good.  The service was excellent; my drink was always filled, food came out on time, and the check came out when I wanted it too, rather than too early or having to ask. The food as delicious. My only beef was having to sit on a stool and lean over a hot (because it was lit) table.  I'll be back with my partner for sure to try the burgers (her) and sandwiches (me)!",

All the servers and host were standing around looking bored out of their mind. My server was nowhere to be found so I waved down a server that was standing right next to me with nothing to do, he shook his head at me and replied \"I'm not your server,\" and went back to staring at the damn ceiling before asking if he could help me with anything. I couldn't read his name tag but I think his name was Ali or ali-something. Finally my server showed up after a few minutes and took my order. If it wasn't for my friend wanting to try this \"popular\" place, I would had walked out of there. Overall, service was below a one star.  As for the food, I got the delux burger since it was their popular item with an order of sweet potato fries. I ordered the burger medium well and it came out way over cooked. It was extremely bland, I had to add a lot of salt and pepper just to finish half of the burger. Oh, the BACON was nowhere to be found in my burger. Over $10 for this dinky tasteless burger? I rather go to in-n-out. The fries was okay since the sauce was good. My friend got the chicken panini sandwich, which she said was nothing special. With that price, you could've gotten much better for less elsewhere.  Overall, we're never coming back.",

I couldn't really see it clearly with dim lighting and blue light emanating from the table tops, but that didn't really matter, because it was flavorful and cooked to perfection. My absolute fav were the french fries that came with different dipping sauces and sweet potato fries. I can't get over the fact that it was just so darn cute that fries came in mini shopping carts, too adorable...I really wanted to take it home. I would definitely come back!",

I've spent quite a few brunches here nursing hangovers with great burgers, amazing mixed fries (they've got the best sweet potato fries in Phoenix), and...flights of beer. HAH. For half-awake, hungry, and indecisive folks like me on a Sunday morn, a beer flight is THE way to go. They've got some pretty decent brews too-- a lot of nice crafts from all over the place with token AZ beers like the Papago Orange Blossom and the Four Peaks Delux brew thrown into the mix. (Note: A lot of the hip, trendy places in Phoenix seem to have their own Four Peak brew...but they all taste the same!).   The burgers, once regarded as the best in Phoenix, are delicious behemoths jumping on the gourmet burger bandwagon of 2007 but falling just a little bit short of greatness. I typically play it safe with the original Delux burger cooked medium well. If I ask for medium, sometimes it's just too darn rare. They've got a mean Turkey burger, and some vegetarian options like a 3-cheese panini and veggie sammy too. The menu is simple, but the servers are not. Sometimes waiters are spot on; legitimately earning those tips with friendly and efficient service. Other times, you don't exist. The good thing however, is that they do offer take-out so you can just bring that awesome meal on home.   Oh, and if you're contemplating a cookie for dessert...DO IT. A simple and scrumptious way to punctuate an already indulgent meal.",

There's some other stuff to try, but I know I'll have a hard time not wanting to just get that burger again next time I go here, which I know will be again...",

Fa-reaking rare;  cook the \"moo\" out and we're good to go.   My sammy was chared on the outside, gray-ish pink on the inside.  Tell Mr. Krabs to fire spongebob and get a wage monkey that can handle temperature orders. (I'd so work here)  All that being said,  the restaurant was nice, though I was sat at the community table (what is with THIS fucking trend? I don't want to sit on a strangers lap...hmmm....) and even though my meat was nuked, it did have some good flavor.  I shall return to Delux in search  of redemtion.  For them.  Yeaaaah.",

I ordered a beer, server asked for my ID, which I handed him, and he ran off with it (I assumed to check it). 5 minutes later he returns with my ID but not my beer! I finally got my beer shortly after.   The food is overpriced and marginal at best. It seems like it is a place to go to be seen as long as you don't care about mediocre food at a Biltmore district price.   When we were ready to leave, we waited for the bill. Then waited some more. Then more waiting. The group of 4 next to us at the table was in the same boat - where is our server & our bill? I finally got up, walked over to the manager & asked for our bill and the bill for the party next to us. He of course apologized. We paid, which took the server way too long to process, and left.   I will not be back & I doubt the party next to us will be either.",

(Both owned by a great, local restaurateur )  there was a perfect \"2 top\" on the patio... and the ambiance was perfect... fabulous menu, just enough \"cafe chatter\" in the background, but not overwhelming, where you cant enjoy a conversation with friends.  So.. we heard the house wine was new on the menu and fabulous... so we tried one white, one red.  Perfect temp... and absolutely devine!  Also got a tip from the table next to us, that the Lollipop Roll x a nd Zen Citrus were a must.  We hadn't planned on eating... but they were better than any I have ever had!  Fresh and top quality... all the way around.... A definite must for anyone looking for a one of a kind experience... local, unique and softly sophisticated.  Can't wait to try MEXX32!

The meat is supposed to be this amazing, specially raised beef - that's all good, but could you maybe add some flavor/spice to it? I'm not sure they even added salt. Besides that, my bun was soaked with juice. Really? I've never even got that at Burger King.   The one positive thing I have to say, is that the atmosphere is pretty cool and they are open late. BUT..even though they are open late..it's not enough for me to go there even when late-night options are slim.",

I'm not sure where people say this burger is phenomenal. Anything usually tastes good with a lot of butter/oil and bacon, which are one of two main ingredients of the Delux Burger after the beef.   But, other than that, the food here is marginal. The Chinese Chicken Salad was horrible (chicken wasn't cooked), fish sandwich was bland, and the grilled chicken sandwich was less tasty than McDonald's McGrilled Chicken.    They have a decent selection of beers; however, the waitresses were slow with drinks and water. I would go to Four Peaks any day as the food is better and the drinks are cheaper. For burgers, save your money and go to In N Out. Although, Chelsea's Kitchen has a pretty decent burger (pricey as Delux though)  I think people in Phoenix haven't had good food before, don't know what good food it, or clueless. Still not sure why people rave about these burgers.",

Am I wearing a sign that says \"sucker\"?  I read about a cool bakery in NYC that sells award winning red velvet cupcakes and they charge $3.00.  In NYC!  This is not NYC.  It's Phoenix.  Come on.  And $6.00 for a hot dog?  Granted, it is a Neiman Ranch hot dog, but it is to go.  I think you can buy a whole package of Neiman Ranch hot dogs at Trader Joe's for $6.00.  That being said, I probably will fall prey to the red velvet again.  As you leave Delux, you can see them in the window of To Go, beckoning like a siren.  Glorious and succulent looking.  Genius.",

Just when you think it couldn't get better come along their fries. I could eat three orders of them. They come in a cute little mini-shopping cart. Delux offers regular fries and sweet potato fries, which are a must if you go there. I always order a combo of the two to dip in their spicy aioli sauce. My boyfriend has made this our official weeknight date spot. It's casual enough to stop by after work but has a vibe that definitley makes it \"date-worthy.\" I've always had great service, and have seen the owner strolling around several times. All-around great place to stop by when in Phoenix.",

I LOVED THE FRIES!  My Mom and I shared the Delux burger which was just enough filling to feel comfortable and not fall asleep during the peformance to follow. My Aunt had their other well known burger, but it didn't seem like anything special. The Delux was great but I'm not sure what was so delux (or $10 worth) about it. The fries are DELUX!

But that's just silly, even though those are great, too. Some people even like their burgers a particular way: with ketchup, with two strips of bacon, with mustard... whatever. I'm one of those people.  But at Delux, you just have to throw yourself into the arms of the attractive waitresses and get what they recommend: the Delux burger medium rare. It's heavenly. And don't forget the basket of mixed fries (sweet potato/regular). Not only does it come out in a little basket, but it also comes out before your burgers. That annoys some, but just embrace being able to nibble on them before the medium rare Delux burger comes out (that is what you ordered, right?).  Plus, they have a killer drink list for a leisurely Friday lunch.",

We also split a shake three ways which was fantastic.  We were all happy with our meals (Delux burger, beet salad, and mahi-mahi sandwich), and it was great sitting outside.  The only reason I didn't give a fifth star was because the service was a little spotty at times.

The salads are not that great and their burgers are more impressive in their description than their actual taste. The milkshakes are rather icy, not creamy. However, it is still pretty good and its open late.",

We did have an off night... burgers were a little dry... so... knocked the review down a star.  the sweet potato fries are great! Burgers are very flavorful and just all around great.  Drop in and give this place a try.  It's not very big... I would suggest you go during the week and avoid it on the weekends or Friday night. Very busy!  But... just go... if you like a really good burger... this is the place to go.",

That is one freakin awesome burger.   And the Banana Split Lava Cake - oh man. What a beast of a desert. It's WAY more than enough for two people...we couldn't even finish it. It's practically the size of a baby. Or maybe a small dog. I think I heard a few \"ooohs\" and \"aaaaahs\" from other patrons when it was brought to our table.

The Delux Burger is by far one of the most delicious burgers I have ever had. Within the 4 month stretch, I usually eat the vegetable panini which is also never a let down. My most perfect meal would be the vegetable panini with an order of sweet potato fries (I have finally learned not to get the mixed basket since the normal fries always disappoint). It is enough to split with someone. Dipping the panini in the special sauce makes it all the better. The food is always good in my experience, but when I go I usually choose to eat outside since inside is so dark and you can't really get up to go to the bathroom without knocking something off someone's table or putting your a** in their face. But if you're in to that closeness, darkness, hip, loud, can't see your food thing then you'll be fine. Delux is a great place to go on a Sunday night at midnight since it really is the only place open in the area. Thank God for that.",

Also because the overwhelming desire to be trendy and coming across as trying to hard seems to fit as well.  That being said, I feel a little glitzier every time I step through your doors.  I am going to go with a Pro/Con for the rest of this review.  Pro: -The fries are pretty darn good.  Smaller and thinner than many places.  I'd recommend getting half sweet potato and half regular.  They come in a shopping cart which is adorable.  Best part is the chipotle mayo that comes on the side. -The beer list is extensive and full of local brews.    Cons: -The menu is a little small and comes with only two types of burgers (three, if you count the turkey burger). -The Delux Burger is just ok.  I have had it three times now and each time I am satisfied, but never thrilled.  I find myself having to slather generous portions of the chipolte mayo on it to make it better.  For 10 bucks, this burger should be stellar and it just isn't.  Like most of the burger places, it is better to come with many people so you can share the cost of the add on fries.  Delux certainly is worth going to, but I would rather go to Zinburger or Fez if I am craving beef.",

Sweet Potato Fries were the best I've had. Very good taste, little crispy on the outside and good texture and temperature inside.  I'd say they were too heavily salted but I'm hardly one to complain about that.  Burger was very juicy and fresh and cooked just right, which led to the bottom of the bun becoming soggy but I can deal with that - I eat slow.  Server was on top of it and, from what it seemed, the manager came around a couple times and made sure everything was going well and that we were happy.  Why 3 stars... It was just what 3-stars says... \"A-ok\"... no problems, everything was good but I wouldn't say that \"yay! I'm a fan\".   It's an upscale trendy burger joint.  To be honest I've had better burgers in hole-in-the wall mom-and-pop shops.  I know the meat is special and grass fed with no hormones or whatever but it's not worth paying x2 as much for. That's about all I have to say about that.  I'd be back but not if I'm buyin :) lol",

There is an outdoor seating area, which is actually pretty relaxing for being in a grocery store shopping center.  This time around we opted to sit inside, and to my delight were seated at the long lighted table in the center of the room!  I love this table because it always makes me feel like I've entered a much trendier, fashionable city than Phoenix.  The fact that they're also open until 2 am helps, too. There's not a lot I can say about Delux that hasn't already been said.  The atmosphere is enticing and the food is always excellent.  They serve Niman's Ranch beef, which always makes me happy, and the price is reasonable for the higher quality meat.  There's a great beer menu, if you're into that sort of thing, and a sizable list of other cocktails if you're not.   If you find yourself drifting towards a drive thru because it's getting late and you're craving a burger, reconsider and head towards Delux for a damn good burger and a drink.",

The highlights for me are the Delux Burger with bleu cheese, beer flights (flight #2), fry carts (a must)  with dipping sauce, & the malts. Burgers are more gourmet then backyard, but they are cooked well and come together very nicely. Service is solid, but sometimes can be a bit crowded, since it's a small spot. Don't overlook the milkshakes and malts at the end, totally worth it and you can ask for it to-go. Highly recommend Delux for anyone craving a new type of burger, & there is now a  sushi spot inside too.",

Unfortunately, having tried both variations of their Burger (The Delux and The Standard) I did discover that the flavor of the Delux comes from the accompaniments and NOT the beef. This comes to light with the Standard, as without onions it does lack the \"beefy flavor\" one expects from an extraordinary Hamburger. Certainly a presentable and repeatable experience, although NOT sure it stacks up against other premium priced Burgers. Their late hours (open til 2:00 AM) are a plus forNightowls.  Biggest hit are the Sweet Potato Fries and the accompanying Aioli. FABULOUS, almost beyond adequate description. Plus the service in a miniature grocery cart is very cute!  Not the best of the Premium Burgers in town (See The Grind) but worth repeating occasionally.",

    "text": "Friendly staff, eager to please. Overpriced at 11-$12 for a sub-par burger. Fries not included ($5 extra). For a place called Delux Burger we expected the menu to consist mostly of well....burgers. Only 2 choices. The burger itself was flavorless and greasy. The Applewood smoked bacon might as well have been missing as at one point we were both digging through toppings in search of the bacon the menu made us drool over. The cheese was nice and gooey, the arugula was fresh, and the bun was amazing. If the main course wouldn't have left us so disappointed I would have gone back just for the fries.",

    "text": "I ordered the classic burger. The bun was over buttered and over toasted so that the first 1/4\" of both the top and bottom buns had the consistency of a crouton and overall a bit dry. The meat was juicy, well cooked, but lacking a little in flavor. The chopped iceberg lettuce was wilted and had started browning, and did not bring the fresh crisp texture that makes this burger so great (usually).   The side of fruit was not fresh and took away from the quality of the burger just by association.   Ordered a basket of the classic french fries and the chocolate shake both of which were the stars of the meal.   I have had this same meal here with satisfaction but this time we left disappointed. If the bun, lettuce, and fruit had been fresh our overall impression would have been positive. The tap beer selection and the fries will probably bring me back.",

    "text": "I can't believe I haven't updated this review for so long! So I have been to Delux several (and I mean SEVERAL) times since the last review. This place has my favorite burger in town. The Delux burger is crazy delicious. I was a fool to ever order the classic burger. The Delux burger has delicious caramelized onions on it and has bacon in it....yes....in it! I solved the problem of their huge burger sizes by taking half home and having it for lunch the next day (ohhh and it is soooo good the next day too). The sweet potato fries are the way to go here, like I said before, they preserved the flavor of the sweet potato in the fry, which is great because usually that delicious flavor is lost. Also, their fry sauce is excellent...good on the burger and good with the fries (and I'm not usually into mayo at all). The prices are a bit high, but for dinner and lunch the next day (and fries with dinner the next day because I always have to take half of the basket home), it is well worth it. Skip the desserts, though, not the most awesome and you can go get Hava Java next door (much better move for sure).",

I will say the seating is a little limited. Furthermore, I've had subpar service mostly every time I've been there. They have recently added a sushi menu which I just do not understand. They state on the tables that it was at the customers request. The bf went ahead and ordered the Vegas roll (why I'm not too sure). anyway, I went ahead and tasted a piece and the smell alone had me question the freshness of the sushi and the batter was slightly soggy. I will stick to burgers at the burger joints and let the sushi places master their sushi, I'd advise this to any of my friends as well :) I'm pretty sure we'll be back but neither the service or the food really help it to be a regular stop.",

If I could give the water a 10 out of 10 stars I would. The water tastes like it has fallen from heaven, filtered through God's tear ducts, went through the springs of Fiji and Iceland to somehow land in my cup. I do not know if it was tap, I do not know if it was filtered but I guarantee this place has the best water. I still think about the water this places serves to this day 3 months later and I wonder quite often if I can go by this restaurant with my 10gal water jug and ask for a water refill. I've drank the waters of all different brands (to me, which all taste different), I have drank the waters of different states (tap or no tap), and maybe it is because I have gotten too used to the filtered cloudy water of the phoenix area...and maybe I'm not familiar with this location...but this place...really, has the best water. I cannot stop thinking about it. Other wise, their food and service is great as well. I did not get a burger, like the name of the restaurant suggests. I got sweet potato fries which come in a small tiny little shopping cart which I thought was endearing, and I also got some sushi which was...a bit more to be desired I suppose. But I forgave the sushi because the water was so good. I will be returning here for the water, and the burger as well.  The service was excellent, when the waiter forgot the sushi, he gave it to us for free afterwards. A+ recommended for water (if you want to taste the best water of your life)",

Portions are huge so split a burger with a date and a shopping cart full of fries with their amazing dipping sauces. Then sit back and enjoy some great local beers or whatever else they have on tap since they have a full bar until closing time.   If you're ending your night here and just eating, get a milkshake. Seriously, when can you ever go wrong getting a milkshake.   Sure food is more pricey here, but you won't get the patio dinning or late night crowd experience from your car of the [insert cheap fast food chain] parking lot, or the amazing fresh, \"all-natural\" grain fed beef. It's worth it.  Protip: Let the waiter know your sharing and they'll split the burger for you and give you an extra plate.",

It has an extensive menu (burgers & sushi!) and a wide variety of selection in wine, beer and other beverages.  The Delux Burger was well cooked to your specifications with quality beef from grass fed cows, but it is a bit blend by itself.  Fries/sweet potato fries are to die for and comes in a cute shopping cart/basket, but it is not included in the price with the burger.  I also ordered a house made root beer and it was well made.   The restaurant itself is quite small, but it is packed and everyone there seemed satisfied with their food.  Service was excellent as well, and the owner (or manager) came by a few times and seemed to be interested in whether people are ordering sushi (freshly shipped from LA?).  This restaurant is also one of the few places that opens until late.     It is definitely a high end burger joint complete with a sushi bar, a good place for a first date, but price was too high for me to fully enjoy a burger. 4+ stars.",

    "text": "Always been a fan of Delux; however it appears that over time and the addition of the 2go feature, has taken it all down a notch. Decided to order carry out on the way home with our 3 year old. Easy parking and the main restaurant was mildly busy for 8pm on a Friday night. Arrived and the cashier provided our 3 year old with a child's coloring page that included the kids menu. What was annoying was not offering crayons to go with it, and then after asking for some, told \"you can get them at the hostess stand in the restaurant\". What? She did finally bring crayons to us, but 10 minutes later. How about keeping those crayons at the 2go cashier as well? Hmmmm....I digress. Ordering and wait time was good (about 20 minutes total). Items were packed well and provided in plastic bags; NOTE to Delux: paper bags are better as when you pick up a plastic bag filled with take out, everything gathers towards the middle and the food inside the containers slides to one side. This can turn into a mess. Kids peanut butter/jelly sandwich was non-descrip; dark bread and soggy fries  Back to the above note on bagging, had paper been used, the french fries would stay where they belong vs using the plastic bags and the fries spilling into the melted peanut butter from the sandwich. Kind of gross. Main burgers (had both the standard and delux) were as good as I remember. However, fries are thrown in a double paper bag; 5 minutes after picking up the meal, fries (both sweet potato and regular) were a greasy clump of nothing. Tossed them both. I'm all about supporting our local businesses in the Arcadia/Biltmore area, but when something starts to slip, I'll run elsewhere. May dine again in the main restaurant , but no more 2go. They just don't have the service level nor take-out best practices to make it worth the time/money.",

My roomate introduced me and although I've been there only once, that was all it took for me to fall in love with this unique Burger joint.   Its probably the best burger I'll ever have!  The fries (regular and sweet potato) come in cute little shopping carts!  Great beer selection and the menu isn't too extensive, but don't bother with anything else than the burger! Not too pricey, and the wait staff is friendly.  Unfortunately is so damn good, its always crowded and the seating area is just so friggin small!  You're kinda seated family style on this long table on bar chairs that don't move.  Wait can be looong sometimes, but trust me, its all worth it in the end when you take your first bite!!  Gosh, my mouth is watering!!!!",

I am an IPA fan so I had a flight of IPA's which were all excellent.  My wife chose a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc to go with the excellent homeade gaspaccio that had sprinkles of goat cheese on top and fresh avocado diced in, perfect for a hot day.  I had the Delux burger which was cooked perfectly and paired that with another beer sample this time the favorite was the \"Coconut Joe\" from Papago Brewing company.  My wife had a turkey burger on a whole wheat bun and paired that with \"The Big Red\" from Australia.  The staff was very helpful, allowing us to sample the beer and wine before committing to a whole glass.  Amanada helped my wife select lower calorie options as she is trying to cut back on calories but still enjoy eating out.  We recommend ordering the 1/2 order of mixed french fries which was still a very large portion.  The shopping cart of fries the the people next to us had was huge!  Be aware of ordering the chocolate lava cake as it is huge and for at least 4 people with 3 large ice cream balls (vanilla, chocolate and strawberry) with lava cake, a serving vessel of hot fudge to pour on top and at least 2 whole bananas!  Kimberly (the other bar tender) helped us pack some up to go.",

They do regular and sweet potato fries (brought out in little shopping carts) and both are amazing - skinny, crispy, not at all greasy - they come with ketchup and another awesome dipping sauce. I've also had the fish sandwich and a salad here, and they were just as high quality and wonderful as their burgers and fries. Shakes are good here, too. They have a very small space, so expect to wait unless you want to sit at the communal table or outside (in which case you still might wait). However, it's a very nice atmosphere, with casual vibe and good music. I only deduct a point because service was so-so on my last visit, and the restaurant smelled like a nursing home for some reason.",

The beer flights might be an interesting choice for my next visit.  The decor is nice with soothing blue lighting.  Be aware of the close sitting quarters.  I wasn't sure about the communal counter in the middle of the restaurant, but it turned out to be pretty good.

(see we have two kids and rarely get to eat without the little ones).    Since we go on the same day we've become familiar with a lot of the wait staff.  We prefer Bobby in most cases-super nice guy working his way towards medical school-loves to gab and gives EXCELLENT service.  He sees us walk in and comes to our table with two tropical ice teas in hand.  Usually we order the same thing-at least husband does-I like to switch it up so after confirming that my husband wants the usual he's off with our order.  Depending on how busy they are we chat with a few of the other servers too.  Since we are frequent visitors we don't even have to show our \"VIP\" card anymore.    Don't count out their turkey burger-I'm not a big turkey burger fan as they tend to be dry but this one is always delish.  The hot dog and chicken panini are also tasty and who can forget the Classic Standard Burger.  Hands down best sweet potato fries on the planet!  We love Delux and their super staff!",

The meat is tender, juicy, and flavorful; the fries are divine; you can't go wrong ordering regular, sweet potato, or a mix of both kinds of fries. As much as I would love to try the other dishes, the delux burger and fries are too good not to order time and again.   If you don't do the delux, get the standard classic burger. Order it on the demi-baguette, as the regular bun gets soggy from the meat juice. Be sure to try the aioli; it's excellent.  This place is popular, so be prepared to wait, especially on the weekends.

If you are against eating at the bar or a more communal type-table, get there early and be prepared to wait.  If you're waiting at the bar, Delux has a decent list of beers, including a few different choices for flights of beers.  Once you're seated, get the Delux Burger!  By the way, Delux is one of the few places I've ever been where they allow you to order a burger medium rare.  Regardless of how you order it, though, I can't think of anything about this burger that i don't like.  Also, it's a big enough burger that you can probably share it with someone else, or take half of it home.  Be sure to order some sweet potato fries, a la cart.",

The long blue table in the center seems to be the place to be.  They tried to sit Mrs. Ambience and her sister (the really pickey one) out side, well, that did not work at all and we moved to the long blue table.  The food was just great, comfort food for late night.  Shopping basket for the fries is a great touch.  Early morning tomorrow, so could not fully ReTox.",

The fries here are amazing and they have an aioli sauce that is AMAZING. Theyre served in a cute little shopping cart, too. They have tons of beers on draft which I really like, and most of their sushi is good too. They're happy hour is relatively unimpressive but does save you a bit (and they do reverse happy hour too). Service is always really good! I also recommend their mini burgers or lava cake. And Haagen daz shakes! Anyway, they're open til 2 and the food is good so I recommend.",

    "text": "I read about this place in Phoenix magazine where it got an A+!   I didn't know anything else about this place besides the fact that it received an A+ for burgers!  When I saw the restaurant from outside, it looked like a small, hole in the wall place. I saw misters in front of it so it seemed nice.   Once I walked in the place, I was surprised by the decor. It has a retro and trendy look. It has a contemporary feel to it with a mix of the oldies. It looked really small at first. When we took the host that we are a table of three, we looked around and realized there's no where to sit. However, the host led us to the other side which I didn't notice. The other side had booths and it reminded me of a cute little ice cream parlor. I like the furniture and decor.  I decided to order the delux burger since I figure it's probably the burger that received the A+. My burger came out and I took a bite of it. It's definitely juicy but does it deserve an A+? Well, I guess it depends how you're rating it. The meat in it deserves an A+ (I got mine medium rare, delicious and juicy!). Everything else in the burger is nothing out of the ordinary. It had arugula and although I don't like arugula, I think if they put more arugula in there, it'll probably be there. There's also onions and cheese there but could I taste it? Hmmm, they didn't put that much especially with the cheese. There was no cheese. The bread was crispy but also soft, so it wasn't bad. Overall, the burger was juicy and good but it could have used more of the other ingredients in there. I like my burgers to be large, packed with flavors from the meat and other ingredients.   The delux burger actually reminds me a lot of the pork belly sandwich at roli roti except roli roti uses pork and this place uses beef. Similar concept - I think the delux burger combination of ingredients probably works better with pork than beef because I think arugula's bitterness goes well with pork than beef (Maybe that's why there's not that much argula).   We ordered a side of fries (regular and sweet potatoes). They were fresh and crispy, delicious! I love the chipotle aioli with it. It goes well with the sweet potato fries.  I'll probably come back and try the classic burger. The delux burger was just something for me to try once to experience.  Pros: +Juicy meat for the burger +Onions are grilled nicely +Bathrooms are neat looking - very contemporary and the sinks are outside. I like the decor a lot! +Love the casual, contemporary furniture +Open late (yay!)  Cons: - Can't really taste the cheese (it's a plus if you don't like blue cheese because you can't even tell there's blue cheese) - The order of a burger is just a burger, it doesn't come with fries or any other sides. You need to order the sides separately.",

The addition of zen 32 sushi is nice light option to have at a burger joint. Some of the sushi items are a little overpriced, but has always been fresh!

    "text": "Delux is great, they do burgers, they have a good beer selection, they do sushi, and their building is kind of split to showcase that on either side.  The right side is Delux, with bar seating in the middle, tables off to the side. There's outside seating with heaters, but I think it's still too cold the couple months Arizona acknowledges winter.   I've never been a huge burger and fries kind of person... until Delux.  They have a relationship with Niman Ranch (vegetarian fed beef) and their Delux burger is so good.  I kept telling myself I'd venture out and try something else, but outside of going for sushi, the Delux burger always happens.   It has caramelized onions, bacon, gruyere and bleu cheese and arugula.  I order it... bleeding.  It's soo goood.    The fries come in a fry cart!!! It's a little itty bitty shopping cart you can wheel around on the table and you can get fries, sweet potato fries, or both!  And it comes with a dish with an aioli on one side and ketchup on the other (there's a divider in the middle, don't panic).  They have my favorite lambic framboise, they have a 4 Peaks beer flight (kilt lifter, hop knot, sunbru kolsh), and a Sweet Street flight that included my beloved framboise, with another local favorite, Papago's Orange Blossom, and Crispin Cider.  They offer other flights and a custom option, and I love the selection.    I came here for sushi once with a friend.  We sat on the left side.. the sushi side.  They were playing episodes of Samurai Champloo on the walls.  The sushi was good, it was standard.  Like it was good quality if you want sushi but nothing stood out.  When I think Delux I still think burger.  If you wanted a burger and your buddy wanted sushi, or vise versa, this would actually work out really well.  So go here because: 1. Delux burger. 2. Beer! 3. You get to play with a fry cart 4. It's open late aaand 5. Reverse happy hour.  You're welcome.",

Not sure what the point of the mix of shaved raw beets and raw carrots was other than garnish.   Extensive wine and beer selection on tap, with Sierra Nevada, Chimay, Green Flash, and Stella to name a few. This place also serves sushi: rolls and sashimi, although 7 slices of yellowtail for $17 is a bit on the pricey side.    This place has won numerous food critic awards for the Delux Burger, so it's pretty ligit as far as burgers go.   Point for improvement: not sure bun qualified for a \"Demi baguette,\" but that's how it's described in the menu. Was more like a French Bread loaf rather than a baguette in the traditional sense and it was a tiny tad on the doughy side.   All in all, I would come back here for the beer and burger.  I'm a tough grader. Service was prompt, nothing special.",

So a good buddy of mine met up for lunch, so we ended up choosing Delux, we both have eaten here before and we knew what they brought to the table.  This place is a great place for burgers and fries.  They are a little higher in price than your average burger joint, but you'll notice the difference in the taste and the quality of ingredients.  I believe they use a better cut of meat than most burger joints and every time I walk away satisfied. They are located off Camelback and 32nd street and are open til 2:00 in the morning.  My good friend and I ordered the same thing, The delux burger and each ordered a basket of fries.  The fries come in a shopping cart, nicely presented along with couple of dipping sauces. ( Ketchup and a Aioli)  I requested the burger medium rare and was cooked very nicely and the fries were nice and hot.  Overall I would highly recommend this place.  Great atmosphere and the service was great.  As mentioned its a little more expensive than more burger places, but its worth it.  If you are craving for the classic burger and fries, hit this place up, you'll be glad you did.",

Then Zen closed and they've apparently merged the two with a limited sushi menu at a burger joint. Kind of an incongruous concept, but honestly, there aren't many sushi choices nearby, so I guess I kind of get it.   Went there last week since I was visiting my family, and we wanted burgers.   So first the good. Fries are awesome, especially the sweet potato fries. They were hot, crisp, and just as I remembered.   Now, the not so good. The sushi. It was convenience store quality. The octopus was tough and rubbery (yes I know it is octopus, but there is a difference between good and old octopus). Yellowtail was fishy.  Portions are generous, but we only ate about half of what we ordered. The rest got sent back. Waitress assured us that the fish was fresh. Maybe they just don't get very high grade fish.  She did try to make things right, and gave us 20% off the bill.   Burgers were good. Nothing crazy. I had a turkey burger. Dad had grilled veggies, and mom did the chicken sandwich. Chicken sandwich had a giant bun with a not so big piece of chicken.   Overall, meh",

We have finally found the place that meets and exceeds our needs! We always ask for Tara because she is AMAZING. She actually cares about us and how we are doing. The Delux burger is to die for. The garlic tomato soup, the roast beef sliders, also the sushi is amazing! The shakes are to die for as well. Did I forget about the fries?! They are so amazing as well. Always come out super fresh and crispy.   If you're looking for a delicious burger, look no more.",

Came here around 11 pm and they have happy hour from 10 p- close!  The place looks cool! There is patio seating, bar, sushi bar, and dining area. It seems like each seating area has a different ambience, so I would love to go back sometime and sit at another spot. We sat at the sushi bar this time because we get complimentary hot sake, pale ale, or house wine. How awesome is that?!  We weren't too hungry when we arrived, so ordered a basket of sweet potato fries and two mini burgers. The shopping cart of fries is just too cute. The yellow dipping sauce that comes with the fries was so good! The burgers were very good as well...the meat was juicy and I love the bun!!!!   Given that...I would go back again!",

    "text": "Delux seriously missed the mark on my visit. We came on a late Monday evening. There were a few tables there eating dinner as well. The service was terrible. We got the feeling that the server was new. The two main misses in service was that she was not paying attention to our table so other servers kept having to get items for us (refills, sauce, the check, etc.). The other miss was that a hot plate was placed in the middle of the table instead of in front of me with no warning that it was hot... ouch!   I ordered a veggie burger and side salad. The veggie burger tasted very plain and was so dry that it was falling apart. The side/house salad is literally a plate of greens. That's it. It was laughable I had never seen anything so plain before! Good thing the French fries were delicious because I ended up filling myself up on those! They did not dissappont.  I don't anticipate myself coming back, but I may give them a second shot as I think my experience may have been an odd one out.",

I know not everyone loves sushi so it's a great spot to for a group of friends with different taste in food. I may love sushi but I am aware not all my friends are sushi fans so hello burgers and fries. Not only was the sushi delicious but so were the burgers and fries.   I can tell the company prides itself in its customer service. They had a sign at our table requesting anonymous feed back. Our server was great and they even gave us a free basket of their fries/sweet potato fries and dessert since their kitchen was a little backed up. The best part was we didn't even have to say anything they thought it was an issue and corrected it.   Overall was impressed with the place, food and service.",

The beer was cold and delicious. I recommend a flight of local drafts on tap. The appetizers and sushi are also excellent. And the burger is -- wow!  Service was very good. And they have Coke Zero, which is always a plus in my book.   It got a little noisy inside at times. The crowd started young but got to be a real mix of people from 18-75 by the time we left. It was a really interesting hodgepodge. Perhaps they needed late night food too.   Delux is worth your time and money. Don't hesitate eating there.",

It was my daughter's 28th birthday and our son suggested that we \"start\" here with some saki bombs.  We have never been here before for sushi but after entering, realized that this is a very cool place.  The service was amazing and even though we weren't having dinner, they still treated us with class and dignity.  We didn't feel rushed and frowned upon for just drinking.  As far as the saki, Sapporo's and crafted cocktails went, this place was a hit with our group of six.  If they have the Jameson drink that is with ginger beer, you must try it.  Thanks Delux for the amazing service!  We will be back!",

The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant was different, but not in a bad way really. I didn't care for the music, but I'm not a huge music person. Lots of tvs in the bar area. The highlight for me was the fries and the beer selection. My burger wasn't that impressive (Delux Burger) and my fiancee wasn't really wowed by her Chinese chicken salad either. I looked at a fair amount of yelp reviews and never saw that the sushi portion of the food menu wasn't available till 4pm, which was a big let down for us. I would like to go back and try the sushi but I'm not sure it would be worth the trip over there again. I would say my experience was underwhelming.",

    "text": "I'd give this 5 stars because the food is awesome and so great they have the impossible burger. Reason I'm giving 3 stars (should be even less but I happened to luck out and not eat the item just in time) is because of the lack of knowledge of one of the servers who has worked there forever.  I came in late night with my boyfriend and ordered the impossible burgers and asked no cheese, no mayo, no dairy whatsoever. Then I asked for grilled onions on it because I don't like raw to which our server said \"we have caramelized onions if that's better\" so of course I said yes!  The burger comes and the onions are on the side so while we were waiting for our fries to cook I just happened to look at the menu again to see if there was something else we wanted to which I see \"AWARD WINNING CARAMELIZED ONIONS WITH BACON\" so they're cooked in with bacon pieces.   I slightly sifted through my onions before putting them on the burger and sure enough there was bacon pieces in it. I don't know why asking for a VEGAN burger the surfer suggested caramelized onions when they're loaded with bacon.  So again, this should be a 1/2 star post BUT because I happened to not eat them and because the food is in fact delicious I wanted to give them the benefit. Just very very crappy I was served that. I know for a fact that server has been there for years so it's extremely upsetting he even offered that option.  If I had consumed bacon this would be an entirely different vibe for this review",

The stools were very uncomfortable, we ended up getting another table outside for the older & pregnant people.   Luckily I am not drinking (I'm the pregnant person) & was full from lunch. Because it took 15 min at least to get drinks, two different waiters took our order at different times so the food came out separately. I only ordered the miso soup, which was disgusting.. I never knew you could mess up miso soup but you can. I tasted a couple of rolls & they weren't anything special.. But the spider roll was the most horrible tasting roll ever. I swore it was made with rotten crab, another person tried it & felt the same way. Our waiters were scattered.. service was a mess.   I don't recommend this place for a large party  UPDATE: Review went from 1  to 4  's   Someone contacted my sister (whose birthday it was) and they apologized & were so kind they refunded her the price of the roll & miso soup I complained about AND sent her a coupon & gift card to try it out again!! They addressed every issue I complained about in a letter  AMAZING Customer service  Thank you for reaching out, I personally don't live in AZ but my sister will be back. I posted a picture of the letter they sent!",

The place is clean, the wait staff is ok, sometimes friendly, sometimes indifferent, but I'm not there for them, I want the food. I've always sat on the patio which is ok, not entirely comfortable, but it's outside and the food is good. Did I say the food is good? It is. And I was looking at the pictures and see that another yelper took my picture one time. How funny!",

    "text": "Honestly, I've worked in the restaurant industry for some time now, and I'm not sure how this place is still open. Maybe because it's a late night spot? Lots of beer and decent food? Not quite sure because everytime I have been at this restaurant they have messed something up. The food is actually pretty good, but I always find the service to be extremely sub-par. It wasn't always like that either.   It's crazy to think this is the same ownership of Zen-32. What's happened? I get that it's a late night spot, but there is no attention to detail. The gentleman that took my to-go order tonight, couldn't even read me back what I ordered on the phone and I actually had to end the conversation. Like how unprofessional? Then I get there this evening to pick up my food and OF COURSE they got the order wrong. Apparently the person was new, but like come on now, how hard is it to read back an order or to ask somebody to repeat themselves if they couldn't hear? Instead of getting my food when I showed up like I should have, I had to wait an extra 10-15 minutes to receive my last item. Funny thing is, they still made me pay for it too. Needless to say I am pissed off, and will not be coming back. I really used to love this restaurant; it's a shame that it's gone to such shit (excuse my French). The owner needs to figure it out, or I won't be the only one they lose.",

This time I ordered also the beet salad which was barely OK. Nothing in particular but the beets (the flavor and texture) are nonexistent.   The patio was super dark, I mean, you could have a whole braid of hair in your plate, that you would't see it.  Also the add sushi in their menu. That gives me the impression that the burgers weren't doing that great. But why sushi instead of improving their flagship dish?  Oh well, 3 solid stars.

Would I have liked more lobster in my bisque? Am I not a man (woman)? So the answer is yes, but the only place that really loads up their bisque with a 1/4 of a lobster is Ray's the Steaks in Arlington, VA. Go to there. Back to Delux. I really did not like the decor/lighting and the seating is uncomfortable. I think a more homey atmosphere would go better with their food and give off a less gimicky vibe. But, what do I know? I am a mere simpleton from Tucson. Some in the party enjoyed their sushi, but I did not try. I thought the low-carb roll options were a neat idea. The beer selection was also better than average.",

    "text": "The only redeeming quality of this place is that they serve Papago Orange Blossom Wheat Beer.  I went here expecting something delicious. We had both heard good reviews, and are both burger fans so we were excited to see what Delux had to offer. Their menu was very limited in the burger region, with only two to choose from and no option to \"build your own burger\" like many burger places have. In addition, their burgers and other menu items are very over priced in my opinion. This restaurant takes pride in serving fresh ingredients. This may be True, but we both left feeling less than fresh. We were both nauseous, and the food resulted in me nearly throwing up a handfull of times.   We ordered two delux burgers; mine was served well done and his was served medium-well. Each burger came with a small side of fresh fruit. We also ordered the half and half fries. I was not impressed by the burger, and thought it was too sweet. I only ate half of mine.   After battling through hours of nausea, I called to speak with the manager. She refused to acknowledge that her establishment was the cause of our nausea and sickness. She told us to \"further investigate\" what he had consumed prior to eating there (but this was the first time we had hung out in 2 days due to complicated schedules- so it was the only meal we had shared). She kept saying to \"further investigate\" what could have made us sick, when we were both certain that it had been the food from Delux. The way that she handled the situation was less than professional, to the point of being insulting. She kept saying that they get their ingredients fresh daily, implying that since their ingredients were fresh, they couldn't have made us sick- which is absurd because there could have been one thing in there that was handled wrong or cooked incorrectly. Then she told me that she would \"further investigate\" with her head chef, and said she would call me back. She called me back less than 5 minutes later, which convinced me that she obviously didn't care and probably didn't check with the chef.   Personally, if I were the manager, I would have apologized for us not feeling well and I would have invited us to come in again, on the house, to try the restaurant again. Instead of handling it like this, she infuriated me beyond belief. The only reason I would ever go back would be to get the beer again, but I definitely wouldn't eat their food.",

    "text": "Sometimes I just want a burger.  But normally burger joints aren't this swanky.  So after much campaigning from my brother, I went and tried out this small hangout near the Biltmore area.  And I left hooked, but not on the burger.  The inside is pretty small with glowing tables crammed together to where only a small group of people can fit (and even then just barely).  They usually play music you'd expect to hear at a club in Scottsdale with mixes of pop, hip hop and techno blaring on the speakers.  The crowd at the restaurant mirrors that feel as most of the people I encountered were very fashion conscious and sporting the bling.  As a whole, the atmosphere wasn't my thing, but for some in the chic crowd this might be to your liking.  Anyways lets get to the food.  I got the staple Delux Burger which is served on a baguette with and has a different (almost fruity) sauce to go with it.  It was okay.  Nothing spectacular.  Then I tried the one thing that might (I stress the word might) bring me back to this place.  The sweet potato fries and the accompanying sauces.  Talk about addictive!  I rummaged through my little shopping cart of fries in no time flat.  The fries alone were almost enough to make me warm up to this place.  In the end however, the noise, the slow service, and cramped feel of the place was too much.  Normally I always stick around to try dessert at a new place, but I constantly got bumped into either by the person sitting behind me or the passing waitress.  I had to constantly shout across the table to carry on a conversation with my bro and it just seemed like they were squeezing more and more people into the restaurant as the evening went on.  We'd had enough and didn't stick around for dessert.  Now to be fair, maybe I picked a bad day to go or my experience was highly unusual.  But I was sure that Sunday evening wouldn't be that crowded and one would think a restaurant's signature burger would be the one to knock your socks off.  Again, I just felt like I was suffacating at a crowded night club more than anything.  Not one to hold a grudge, I don't want to discourage people from giving these guys a try.  Judging from the crowds we saw it looks like it has a pretty solid following.  I just wish I'd decided to grill my own burger on the Foreman that night.",

I think serving a burger on a baguette is a bad choice. It was hard to eat and I thought it had a funny taste from the combination of cheeses and caramelized onions.  I also didn't like that they cut it in half.  The standard burger is a whole different story.  It is fantastic!  The quality of meat they use can't be beat.  I don't even order cheese on my burgers.  The meat itself is so flavorful it doesn't need anything else on it.    Every time we've ordered there our burgers always comes out at the perfect temperature.  I order medium rare and my husband orders medium well.  Usually when we order burgers at other restaurants   both of our burgers come out medium because the kitchen can't get the timing down for the two different temps, not at Delux.  My burger is always perfectly medium rare and his is always perfectly medium well.   The sweet potato fries are to die for.  Their always perfectly cooked and the dipping sauce they come with is awesome!",

The applewood smoked bacon was barely detectable, and there was a big glob of caramelized onions masking any flavor that would have otherwise been noticed.  It left the burger tasting a little too bland.  They should consider cutting the onions in half, and maybe adding some pesto or something in addition to the aragula to give it a little contrast.  I particularly appreciated the fact that they had Sonoran Root Beer on tap.    In a more negative vein, the food took forever, and the price for a burger, fries, and root beer was almost $20.  Definitely not a good value.  It's worth stopping by if you're in the area and you want a burger, but you don't need to go out of your way for this.  It's somewhat overhyped.",

Even on a Sunday the restaurant was full but we got lucky and there was no wait for a table. Service was excellent with our waiter giving good suggestions and advice about what to order. We got a few baskets of the mixed fries - regular and sweet potatoes - which come in the miniature shopping carts as mentioned by other reviewers. The fries are delicious and my children loved the little carts.   For the main meal, my wife and I both had the Delux Burger as did my mother-in-law and my father-in-law had a salad. The burgers are big so bring your appetite or prepare to share your food! However, the burgers are delicious and well worth the reputation they have earned.  I didn't try any, but the selection of microbrews is extremely impressive and its nice to see a place with such a good representation of local and regional beers.  Finally, save room for dessert. The choices looked great and I saw other diners enjoying them. Unfortunately I was already stuffed!  Overall, Delux is definitely pricey but well worth it for one of the best burgers I have ever experienced. If I lived in Phoenix full time, I would make this a regular stop!",

The Delux burger itself is much meatier than most burgers, and I think this is what impresses most people. Unfortunately, the meat and bread lack flavour. On return visits, I tried it a few more times, but there's something about the meat that sets me off. I usually walk away feeling not quite right and suspect the meat has been treated.  Nice place for people who don't care too much about the food but want an interesting ambiance; otherwise, it seems to stretch its image of itself beyond reality somewhat. I don't object too strongly to coming here, but on my own accord, would not choose to visit again.",

    "text": "Two years ago, I moved from the Bay Area to Phoenix (and yes, I have had Barney's burgers, and Delux is WAY better).  I moved into a place behind Delux and an addiction was spawned.  This is THE BEST PLACE in Phoenix to get your late-night eating on.  Open 'til 2 a.m., I can blame Delux for my extra 5 lbs. of Phoenix weight.    Here's what would happen: I would get into my pajamas and get into bed, at around 11 p.m.  Then, I would start thinking about the sweet potato fries with their completely crack-addictive aioli.  I would open my window a little bit and then start to smell a little burger grease.  Like a mindless zombie, I would then get OUT of bed, put on clothes, walk through the gate to Delux, and order a shopping cart of sweet potato fries and their house burger.  This would happen 2-3 times a week and it was Heaven. The herbs and seasoning on the fries make them the best I've ever had.   I took my parents here and they could not speak for several minutes.  It was that good.  Although trendy, yuppyish, etc., I was always made to feel comfortable here, even if I came in my sweats. Alone. In the night.  The only thing I would recommend for change is their salad.  I really like caprese salads and theirs would be MUCH MUCH better with a lil' fleur de sel and some balsamic reduction, NOT just watered-down balsamic.    I moved back to the Bay Area last year and have to satisfy my burger and sweet potato fries cravings at The Counter in Palo Alto.  It's a poorman's version of Delux and every time I eat there, I feel depressed with how much I miss Delux.  I have seriously contemplated buying an airline ticket and staying in a hotel just so I can go to Phoenix for a weekend and gorge myself on Delux and a few of my other favorite Phoenix restaurants.  The justifiably \"higher-than-your-average-burger-joint\" prices are somewhat defrayed if you ask for a VIP card: they give you 10% off the food at Delux and Zen 32!",

I highly recommend the sweet potato french fries with chipotle mayo, as well as any of their burgers. But stick with the beef, as the only legitimate knock here are the chicken sandwiches.",

Here's the deal, they have an amazing selection of all craft beers (around 50 plus seasonals), they have a decent selection of local brews, by the way and they do have something for the veggie lovers.  If you order the grilled vegetable panini sans aioli and cheese, you're in the clear.  The baguettes are vegan (not the brioche buns, obvs) and they have a few salads that can be modified.  They also have a tasty gazpacho with avocado and (minus the goat cheese).  The fries are good, but I'm kind of over the whole sweet potato fries thing.  Back to the booze.   They have flights (three 5-ounce beers of your choosing, or preselected)!  They offer tasty martinis and wine, and have a fairly extensive liquor cabinet.  The staff is friendly and the vibe is pretty cool.  They are open until 2am, everyday so it's nice for those of you who like a late night snack or if you're preggs.  One more thing, they do use Niman Ranch beef, so at least you're eating grass fed beef and not contributing to the nasty system that feeds poor cows antibiotic-laden corn.  That is all.",

The burgers are high quality and cooked to perfection, also the bread is amazing. I'm not a huge fan of bleu cheese and it's on the Delux burger so sometimes I will just substitute it for some Monterrey jack or American cheese. The mixed (regular & sweet potato) fries are a MUST! They come with an addicting aioli sauce that I always need extra to spread on my burger. Since the burger is so huge I always split with the manfriend. To top off a great meal we get the black and white milkshake which is vanilla with fudge (BOMB.COM). Regardless of the amazing food, the service is impeccable. My bf was super thirsty and was joking that the waiter would not be be able to keep up with his light speed water drinking. Well, sure enough, the waiter was crazy on top of it the whole meal. HAD to tip big--he was amazing. I will be sure to remember his name next time and update this review with props to him.",

Thank you Lacy. Room was comfy, we sat at the large community table, had great people watching. Fries were yummy tho a VERY small portion in exchange for one Abraham. The Delux Burger had no flavor of Maytag Blue cheese (or Kenmore for that matter...god that's not even remotely funny) or bacon. Cupcake at the end was dee lish. My favorite part was a picture of Pink's hot dog stand on La Brea in L.A. that adorned the wall.  Although my freshman Delux experience was aight....I couldn't help but stare at the framed photo of my second favorite weenie stand in the good ole u s of a! Three stars. That's all.",

For a better burger visit the Chuck Box in Tempe, Cheeburger Cheeburger also in Tempe, Johnny Rockets, the Hard Rock Cafe or even Carl's Jr! Spare yourself the pain of fighting for parking with people trying to get their groceries from the grocery store a few doors down. Unless you are a size zero, this place is CRAMPED! A more unwelcoming hostess I have never encountered. This is a burger joint people, not Nobu or the French Laundry!",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying I am enormous Burger fan, I love them. I eat at least 2-3 a week, no problem and it is absolutely safe to say that I would choose a cheesebuger as my last meal on earth.. I once called In & Out my True love, but last night my friends, I met someone new and have fallen hard... his name is Delux, and he is amazing.  I arrived here really late to meet up with friends, so I didn't spend too much time inside.. and I never actually saw a menu, but from what I gather, the place is totally popular based off the amount of people and the wait I was told about, also that they have a great beer list (also a full bar) and some wonderful orange special sauce that you definitely need to dip your french fries (and whatever else) in. The interior reminded me of something the wonderful Chef Barbara Lynch would do. The Butcher Shop in Boston is very similar, aesthetically anyway. Since I was late and it was packed, I didnt get to order, so I just want to extend an enormous thank you to the wonderful Georgie S. for sharing with me the most amazing burger I have ever had. In my life. Hands down. I was in meat heaven last night, and the fries were freakin' awesome too, served in a miniature shopping cart no less. Top that off with a Makers on the rocks, and you have one, very happy Nikki.  In & Out... I would like to apologize for cheating. I still love you Animal Style #2, but it was worth it, I am in love and I now have a new favorite.",

It's a must when u come) the sauce served with is yummy in your tummy! We got the smaller version of the salad and the portion was perfect for me since I still had fries on the side. The service here is also spectacular! Our waitress was a sweetheart and another man consistently checked up on us as well. We were really looking to catch up, so it was really nice that even after our meal they still made sure we were okay. Everything on the menu is delicious here, I've been many times. I'd recommend Delux to anyone! You'll be far from disappointed in all aspects!:)",

Fish is always fresh. My boyfriend loves the burgers here, especially the turkey burger. I love their lobster bisque which I believe is only available on Fridays. Their fries are good but I don't get the hype. The drinks are good too. I always have the deluxtini while my boyfriend gets the buddha beer.   Prices aren't cheap but aren't too expensive either.

The hamburger is pretty simple just great meat, cheese and bun, they do give you lettuce, pickles and tomatoes on the side and I asked for mayo and the brought that too. Meat was cooked perfect, it needed a tiny bit of more salt other than that, it's a decent burger. The sushi tasted fresh and it's one of the best ones that we have tried in Phoenix.

    "text": "I'm SINCERELY blown away by the negative reviews about their Delux burgers. My boyfriend and I would come here at least once or twice a month when we lived downtown solely for burgers.    Seriously, these burgers are the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>  - Juicy, flavorful, not piled 2' high with useless veggies that take away from or try to mask the flavor of the meat itself. The bread is soft and helps in absorbing the juices from the burger. They have this amazing spicy aioli that comes with the fries and I usually spread that on the bun for a little extra kick.   Since moving 15 min outside of downtown we don't frequent Delux as much as we would like, but we did make it down last night for a late dinner.   Managers - your new bartender is the SWEETEST. I ordered an annoyingly complicated (I know this. I manage a restaurant. I judge myself for ordering it. Every time.) Manhattan. It came out wrong the first time, but the server took it back and had the bar remake it. The bartender ( didnt catch her name but short with shorter dark hair ) delivered it the second time, made sure I was happy with it and asked me to taste it before she left to make sure it was perfect. Such a sincere extra step to insure customer satisfaction. Muffin.   Anyway - Delux, keep doin' what you're doin! Don't change a thing!",

The regular fries were seriously no better than fast food. The burger was decent and cooked to medium well as requested but it really just wasn't anything special. We were there during happy hour and draft beer is a dollar off. That's good because draft beer prices are on the high side. For the two of us with one beer each the meal was fifty dollars (that's after the 7% Yelp cashback). I really wanted more out of it than this.",

I've had the sliders, basket of fries and the california, Las Vegas and rainbow rolls.  As usual I can't get past what I love but I have made an executive decision to try 1 new item every time I go there.  In closing, if you haven't been here, go.  You will not be disappointed.

I think I could eat that sauce with every meal for the rest of my life (did I take that too far?). I usually do a basket of mixed fries - half sweet potato and half regular - and even dip my grilled cheese or burger in it!  I also got one of their giant cookies and the waitress offered to warm it up for me... Game-changing. So fresh and so good! Thanks Delux for being such a staple in my life for all these years! :)",

The happy hour isn't amazing price wise but some savings are better than none right?   Typically it's risky to eat raw seafood in landlocked states as is but I am a risk taker. Sushi and burgers? Why not. So I got the tiger roll and the salmon nigiri. The tiger roll was great, I could have done without the drenched sriracha on top. The salmon nigiri was a let down. Usually I expect my salmon to be almost buttery. No fishy taste but this definitely let me down and it was disappointing.   The Deluxtini was fun and refreshing! Their fries are great too. I wouldn't come back but if my friends really insisted, I could deal.",

Wonderful and Fantastic at the same time!!! I loved the Delux turkey burger, and am totally enamored with Zen sushi!  Don't get me started on the location at Sky Harbor in terminal 4! Their breakfast sandwich is phenomenal!!! B.L.T. makes me reconsider going vegan! I have to keep reminding myself that I no longer eat meat! So this past visit, I had the beet salad- bomb!!! I love beets, and their beet salad had beets a-plenty!  Do yourself a favor and head to Delux!!",

Our server was friendly, but got two of our orders wrong, (two house-made hot dogs, fully loaded, they seriously came with a plain bun! Couldn't of been more opposite!

Next time I will try the lettuce wrap option, or just go for some sushi or a salad. Our server Connor was friendly, humorous and very accommodating to us and our pup.   Bonus: they have a dog menu!

    "text": "A friend & I were burger-fixated & realized it had been eons since going to Delux. Ok maybe I was and she wanted sushi! My friend schooled me that Zen 32, the former sushi spot, merged with Delux and we could both get what we were craving. We reviewed online menu ahead of time & thought Happy Hour was daily (b/c it didn't say otherwise). FYI: Happy Hour is during the week only. Can y'all update that on the web site?!  Michael waited on us: we monopolized his time but he was a good sport. We both ended up going for the same: two Delux Burgers and a cart of Sweet Potato Fries, doubling up on that magnificent mayo/mustard dipping sauce. My friend got hers perfectly cooked, \"medium rare.\"   Although I emphasized I wanted mine \"well done,\" I got a burger that was pink inside. Michael took it back and had them make a fresh one. Second time around came back \"well done\" as requested. Their beef is primo, supplied by local Nieman farms. The signature Delux Burger is topped with caramelized onions, Gruyere/Blue cheese and arugula. A winning flavor feast. :P  Friend drank a White Rascal beer with subtle hints of coriander & orange for a sweet, spicy tinge.  Since my burger wasn't cooked as ordered, they comped our Fries. Bravo - much appreciated! Having worked in restaurants, both my friend & I understand that mistakes happen. The most important thing is how management handles it and then treats the customer. We continued to get rock star service.  I'm happy to see Delux is going strong after FIFTEEN YEARS: I remember when it first opened & we all fell in love with this special spot! Still special, local & superlative.",

    "text": "I know, I know, some of my fellow yelpers (one in particular :) ) will for sure disagree with my review but Delux for me was just a decent dining experience at an overinflated price point.    Upon walking in and being seated, the staff seemed a little stiff. Don't get me wrong, everyone was nice but didn't really feel like anyone was really happy to be there.   The restaurant was nice. It had ample televisions with a large bar.  More of a nice bar feel than restaurant vibe.  As for the grub, I had the classic burger ($13.00).  All their burgers are made with Niman Ranch prime beef.  The utilization of this quality beef showed and made for a good burger. In my opinion though, the quality meat does not carry such the high price point.  With the burger, we had an order of the sweet potato and regular fries, which were served in tiny grocery like carts. Both fries were pretty good. As interesting as the little carts were though, at $7 and $8 a piece for the fries, I once again am left thinking I am not getting enough bang for the buck. Lastly, we had to try their chocolate signature shake, which are made with Haagan Dazs Ice Cream. Now, that little puppy was tasty and worth the price ($8) paid.  Overall, we had a decent dining experience and good food but paying over $100 for a family of four to have burgers, two fries, two soft drinks, and one shake seems pretty crazy. I am still left searching for the perfect burger and until then, I think I'll stick with Whataburger. :)",

    "text": "I haven't been to Delux in a few years, but was craving a vegan burger so I thought I'd give them a try again. Main improvement since I was here last: they removed the cramped tables and put in booths! That probably happened awhile back, but it made a big difference for me. It was a much more enjoyable (and private) space - better for business and long conversations.  While the menu doesn't mark what is vegan (or could be made vegan - which lost them a star), I had previously been told that the veggie burger is vegan. I asked if I could get the $12.95 lunch special - burger and fries - with the veggie burger and was told yes. The server then asked if we wanted regular fries, sweet potato or a mix. My friend and I both went for the mix, but I was surprised to see with the bill that we were charged $13.95 instead of $12.95. Considering my veggie burger was only $10.95 compared to the usual $12.95 burger, you'd think they'd waive the extra dollar (that we were not told about in the first place) but no. So, that also added to them not getting 5 stars from me).   The burger and fries, however, were excellent. The veggie burger is house-made - sort of a compilation of various veggies in a panko crust, grilled (or fried?) to a crisp. It tastes great, but it does fall apart pretty easily. The fries lived up to expectations - perfectly crisp and flavorful. I've enjoyed the beet salad in the past too - made vegan by changing the dressing to a balsamic reduction and removing the cheese. It's a big salad though - even when ordering the small size - so I normally share a burger and salad with my spouse.  The service was excellent. There was no wait, and it was nice and cool inside. Our server kept an eye on us but did not intrude in our conversation. I did run out of water for a few minutes, but that's because it's 116 out! Overall it was a good experience, but I'd like them to be more clear about prices and to mark vegan options on the menu!",

    "text": "First time experiencing Delux.  I decided to order their chinese chicken salad which is loved by so many on Yelp.  I used to fly to Vegas just to have Spago's chinese chicken salad among other delicious treats available on the Las Vegas Strip.  We started with a flight of 3 beers.  We liked one of them and the other two we would not order again.  I ordered the junior version of the chicken salad (which is a little smaller) plus an individual burger which is more like an oversized slider.  My companion ordered the turkey burger and we shared an order of mixed fries--sweet potato and regular.   The Chinese chicken salad was delicious!-- lots of interesting greens with bits of grilled chicken, crispy chinese noodles, red peppers, etc.  Came with two sauces-- one peanut sauce and another which had the taste of sesame oil.  One was more delicious than the next.  I shared it with my companion so I wished I had not ordered the junior size.  He loved it too.  My burger was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I was super impressed that it was seasoned so well.  Came with melted american cheese and dill pickle.  My companion's turkey burger was perfectly cooked which is not the usual with turkey burgers.  They tend to be overcooked.  It came with pico-de-gallo, a generous portion of sliced avocado, lettuce and tomato.   The fries seemed to be from fresh potatoes crispy and delicious.  Our server, Kalani, was very attentive and friendly.   Definitely coming back for that Chinese chicken salad.  Not as good as Spago's but then again I don't have to fly to Vegas to get it.",

Juicy, flavorful and cooked perfectly. We shared a Delux burger on this visit (we couldn't finish them last time, and it's a 59-mike trip home for us!).  Our sever split everything for us - the burger, the shake and 2spoons for our soup.   They have a featured soup of the day. On Thursday, it's mushroom Brie.  You've got to try it. Creamy and just the right amount of mushrooms.   Love the sauces they serve for your fries. Tip - get the mixed fries. So good!   We will be back - there are many items on the menu we want to try. And Sushi after 4:00!!!!",

The ambience is fun, casual, with cool lighting effects and a nice little patio.  We really appreciated the little touches including delivering the French fries in a little grocery cart!  Would definitely recommend especially for late night eats (huge plus of full kitchen open til 2!!)  late night joints with this quality of good are quite rare :)",

    "text": "I ordered the traditional burger, with swiss cheese, cooked medium rare, with a side of mayo along with a half and half fry. My friend ordered an artichoke cream soup (options change daily).   Her soup came first. It was delicious. Had it not been about 110 degrees outside I might have been more inclined to devour it.  The burger had a cute stick in it that made note of the temperature at which I had requested my burger arrive. All of the extras were on the side, pickes, onions, tomatoes, and shredded lettuce (as a side-note, I LOATHE shredded lettuce, I think it is the bane of all greenery). The side of mayo was just enough. I immediately cut my burger in half, and it was cooked to as I had asked. It was juicy, the bun was nice and definately MADE the burger (more so than the patty combination that is expounded upon so much in their description that I couldn't even manage to understand if it might come with a side of gold bullion, bc it seemed to be THAT).   The fries were a combination of shoestring-cut sweet potato and average potato, served in a cute little metal shopping cart, low grease and cooked nicely. They came with a dish that had ketchup on one side and what seemed to be a mayo/chipotle combination on the other.  I took a peanut butter shake to go. It was good, but I could get the same at Sonic.   At this establishment you are definitely paying for the fluff-factor, a ten dollar burger tastes like a five dollar burger but comes with five dollars worth of accessories (temperature stick, shopping cart caddy, etc).   There is a lot more on the menu, so if you want to impress someone with a ten dollar burger go for it, try the soup though (it's only five dollars and a little more mouth-watering),",

It would be wrong of me to not be appreciative of their burgers, especially the Delux Turkey burger. It's one of the few places I've been to where the Turkey burger comes out moist and not dried out, and served with a really good cilantro and garlic aioli. The fries (they have both regular and sweet potato) served in the mini shopping carts is a great concept, and the micro brewery they have makes Delux a good place to grad a bite and enjoy a brew. As for the sushi, it's decent and does satisfy any late night cravings since they have reverse happy hour from 10 to close daily. It's a good eats kinda place and one of my late night favorites, it's worth a try.",

Can I resist trying it?  No.  No I cannot.  Right when you walk in, I was struck by the 'cool' factor they have going on.  Dark paneling and blue accents, as well as an awesome long blue table in the middle.  It's not a big place, and I can see it would be easy for it to feel really cramped in there.  Luckily, the lunch crowd had dwindled, and my friend and I had enough space.  Sweet potato fries?  Done.  I was wildly amused that they came in a little shopping cart.  They are also served with side of ketchup and some some of vaguely-Cajun remoulade.  They.  Are.  Awesome.  And then my burger came out.  I really think I heard a choir sing.  They win huge points for presentation here.  The colors they use to accent their burger are truly masterful.  It helps that the burger tastes awesome too.  And, truth be told, we went back that evening after the coffee shop gave us the boot for a post-studying drink.  We got to sit at the big blue table and enjoyed some of the many, many beers they have on tap.  It's a great place for a meal or a drink.  Now if only they had a quiet little corner I could put all my books out on...",

    "text": "Bar none, the BEST place in Phoenix to get a burger. I took a friend here for lunch today (Ada G.) and we split the Delux Burger (medium rare) and the sweet potato fries and each had a hard cider. I've been telling her how good it is and she's been wanting to see for her self and she wasn't disappointed.   The fries always come out first in their cute little grocery cart and we each get our own dipping sauces (ketchup and some kind of chipotle aioli?). Once we gorged ourselves on those, our burger came (we split, how else can we be expected to keep our girlish figures?) and it was on to the second course. The patty is always the perfect medium rareness. The juice from the meat melds with the Gruyere and blue cheeses and makes the perfect sauce with the caramelized onions. It's topped with arugula and is served on a baguette. When you get this, don't change a thing. It's perfect as it. It would be a travesty to play god and change these beautiful flavors. I love this burger. I could eat another one now. If I could write poetry I would write it a poem, but I can't so I'll just stop now. And maybe plan my next visit.",

I have no idea what they do with these fries, maybe they fry them in sugar oil, I have no idea what makes them great, but you MUST get an order of them!

If you want some extra room (they tend to really pack people in the main dining area) and if you want to make a reservation so you don't have to wait for a table (they don't take reservations); the private room is the way to go.  It seats about 10 people but the catch is that you have to spend at least $200 which normally isn't a problem if you go with more than a couple people.  The room itself is kinda cool but you can totally tell it is their office/conference room thingy.  They should really clear it out of all the office junk and make it more of a dining room thing.  It was pretty cool anyway.  Very private and quiet.  The salads, burgers and fries were excellent as always.  The sweet potato fries were a bit raw/undercooked which pissed me off but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to complain.  Our waiter was very friendly, quick and accommodating to our large party.",

    "text": "Stopped by Deluxe last night.  It's got that fun, it's-almost-like-we're-at-a-night-club ambience for people who want to feel like they're going out when they eat.  The tables were all lit up blue, the furniture is very modern and the music was hoppin'.  I ordered the Classic-Standard Burger.  The food and service was good, but I have one major complaint.  The prices are outrageous.  The burger I ordered was $9.90 and didn't come with fries, but instead, a teacup sized serving of melon. Like every other red-blooded American, I like my burger with a side of fries. It cost me $6 to get that.  (These were not $6 fries.) And while our service was otherwise good, when I asked about ordering fries for moi our waiter didn't suggest the $3 alternative (1/2 portion).  I still don't think you should have to pay additional for fries with a burger, but hey, that would've been better.   I get it, they're hip, the food is tasty, and they're kitsch so the prices are high. But there's limits to how much you can charge for a simple burger and fries.  For that price or less I can go to Houston's and get a burger with amazing shoe-string fries or get one with fries and fruit at AZ88. (Both restaurants are larger and their wine lists and menus are too.)   My advice to the owners: make your almost non-existent serving of fruit exchangeable for a satisfying portion of fries. If you are going to charge for fries as a separate, (hahem, your competitors don't), they shouldn't range from $5 (regular) - $6 (sweet potato) for a full serving.  The fries taste pretty much exactly  like Fuddruckers'.",

    "text": "Delux is good...it's just not as great as people make it out to be. They've got decent burgers, but they're nowhere near the best around. It's not worth a special trip to eat there, but if you're in the neighborhood anyway Delux isn't a bad place to eat.  You can tell they use high quality ingredients in the burgers, but the overall combination of flavors isn't out and away mind-blowing or anything. They are good. I could even say they're \"tasty\"...but I can't extend any praise beyond that. Also, for a place that's supposedly known for their burgers, I find it odd that there are only 2 burger options on the menu. Another note: if you want your burger Medium Rare, then order it Medium; or, if you want it Medium, then order it Medium Well. They have a tendency to undercook your burger by one level -- at least they keep doing it to me. The last time I was there, my (supposedly) Medium Rare burger possessed all the color and delicious slimy texture of red, raw ground beef. \"Mmmm....!\" (said with sarcasm)  The inside is narrow and cramped -- hardly a place to kick back and get comfortable. The service is okay -- not super friendly, but not over-the-top rude either. The fries are delicious though. And the beer selection is good. Overall, this place is \"just alright.\" I'm not a huge fan, but sometimes I'm in that neck of the woods and someone I'm with will want to go there. So, I can't say I'll never return...but I'm not looking forward to it. There are just so many amazing burger options in the Valley (SEE MY LIST), so I really don't see the point of going out of my way to get to Delux for their burger.",

Sometimes I get home from work at odd hours in the early am and since their grill is open to 2am I can call in and pick up a delicious sandwich on my way home. One thing I have to say is some of their food I dislike. I love their chicken panini and chinese salad. Their sweet potato fries are also awesome. Their burgers and sushi are like 3 star quality and some of their drinks are rather weak. But hey, I go there and get what I like and I am super happy every time!",

Ordered a Delux burger, and 2 Chinese Chicken Salads. $9.5, and $9 respectively. 1 beer, 2 glasses of wine, and two Ketels and Soda. The basket of mixed fries; get ready for it.... $6. Are you effing serious? Grand total, $77. Tip and total $83. (edit: my numbers were off, and it was brought to my attn that the tip sucked... so it was closer to $87 or 88.. we did leave a fair tip because the service was good.)  Value. It sucked. 6 bucks for a basket of mixed fries; it had better come with a blow-job. The bread on the burger was a little firm. Not saying stale, but a little firm. The burger was cooked right, but it just missed something. The salads were good, but not great. Just a ho-hum meal.   Great selection of beers on tap, and a great bar. Great service, too, but the food left too much on the plate to be taken seriously as a $100 burger joint.   For almost $100 you should leave with a big smile on your face, not holding your ass like someone just raped you.    Gotta say... It was entertaining watching a girl make out with two different guys at the same time. (+1 star) The whole group was snowed out of their minds. (-1 star) Think she put that in the, \"things I did last night that I do not remember\" category? Eh, maybe. But, it was a little awkward sitting with my family while watching the sexcapade.   So, the lesson here boys and girls is, when it's the only late-night game in town, you can charge whatever you want.",

I am happy to say that 10 years later, I feel the same way as when I first visited.    The Delux Burger is their flagship burger and is wonderful.  You have to try it with a shopping cart of sweet potato fries.  Don't forget to put some of their custom aioli on it.  If you are in the mood for a sweet treat, try one of their awesome deserts or even a milkshake.  Peanut Butter and Chocolate have never tasted so good!",

    "text": "DELUUUUXXX! Is my absolute favorite burger!!! Anytime I want a burger i dont even hesitate its gonna be Delux!   The first time I went to Delux it was with my mom  and her girlfriends we had a huge group of 12 women. Our waiter was such a delight he knew all of the beers on tap and knew his wine very well. I got the pear cider (delicious!) When it came down to ordering he told us if we haven't eaten there before then we have to get the burger me./well so we all did just that. And of course we got the fries (you can get the fries mixed with sweet potatoe and russet) i highly recommend getting the mixed fries. And OMG you have to ask for extra sauce that comes with the fries because its not only good with the fries its superior on you burger.  That burger is gourmet and freaking amazing it seriously melts in  you mouth! There is a reason why they only put lettuce on this master piece. You can taste the perfect of the meat the and the gooey deliciousness of guryer and blue cheese. For the price of everything its not even expensive!  My mother and i loved this place so much we went back the next day!",

    "text": "I created a Yelp account to give this review to Delux. I consider myself a regular as I frequent here about once a week, and I live about 45 minutes away. This is a testament to how wonderful the establishment is. I don't really do reviews but I'll give it a go anyhow.  Food: Top notch. My favorite place to eat hands down. Get the Delux burger. It is 10/10. Read the other reviews for sexy adjectives on what is included with the burger. Sweet potato fries...Christ in heaven I love them. I will not eat them from anywhere else anymore, they simply don't measure up to the ones served here! Their shakes are out of this world, Haagen-Daaz I believe. I have recently started branching out from just the Delux burger. I rarely go alone and with friends I will order the grilled vegetable panini - OMG! Thunderstorm of flavors in your mouth, just fantastic! From what I see and hear they have quite a large variety of beers on tap - one I am eager to try is the Papago Orange Blossom, looks ace.  Atmosphere: For me, it is wonderful. Small, intimate yet loud, great vibe, chill music, all around fun. Almost club/lounge-esque.   Service: One of the reasons I come so frequently. I have had three stand out servers here that I LOVE. First, I believe her name was Stacy. She was in training when she waited on me, and gave me the best service I have ever received at any restaurant. Second, Alejandro. Very nice kid and down to earth, no bs-ing or fake smiling for a tip. Talks to you like a fellow human not paycheck. Third, I believe her name is Amanda. Funny, alert, observative. Never had bad service here from what I can remember, but these waiters/waitresses stand out in particular.  10/10, my favorite place bar none.",

    "text": "I'm not as impressed with this here \"2go\" version of Delux as everyone else. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy eating at Delux itself once in a while (including their new turkey burger), but when you sit around waiting for your burger just as long (or even longer, because sometimes they forget about you next door) as Delux itself, \"2go\" really loses the point.  Dock a star for the useless lit-up bench-that's-not-a-bench in front of the register. Who was the brilliant mind who designed that? Makes no sense to me whatsoever.   Then we have the ready-to-pick-up cold sandwiches in the fridge, along with sushi from Zen32. Sandwiches and salads run on average in excess of $7. Are you really going to pay $7 for a pre-made sandwich or salad? You're not in an airport waiting lounge (or anywhere in London), so that can't be your excuse . Although D2Go tries enticing folks to buy the sandwiches buy throwing in a free side of potato/pasta salad.   There aren't many places to sit and wait here - coupled with the sign that basically says \"Don't even THINK about eating here, mofos.\" Yeah, I knew that already.  So for me, eh. The cooked food, when I do eat it, is still really good, but there's no point in being in the local vicinity, suddenly getting a Delux craving, walking in here on a whim and ordering a hot dish (vs. calling beforehand). You may as well dedicate yourself to just eating next door, because you'll find yourself waiting and twiddling your thumbs without a drink in hand for at least 30 minutes. The cold, pre-made sandwiches aren't really worth the price (I tried a few). The sides are decent and they offer a selection of cupcakes and other desserts. They also have a hot dog machine, if you want to forgo everything else (I haven't reached that point though - I only save that for Costco).   So in the end, D2Go is nice in theory, but a little bumpy in execution. If you don't want to wait, buy something from the fridge that's not really worth the price or call an hour beforehand. Otherwise, sit down (but not on the lit-up bench-that's-not-a-bench) and devote your energy to beating your high score on your phone's version of Tetris. It's going to be a while.  2.75 stars (round up to 3).",

You would think that a restaurant that serves both sushi and burgers wouldn't be that good, but let me tell you! We only got the avocado roll for sushi but it was so good! Husband and I both got burgers after with a basket of fries. First of all, they come out in an actual basket! Cutest and coolest thing ever, I freaked out. I got the delux burger and my husband got the turkey burger. His was pretty messy but so delicious. As  for mine, it was medium rare and tasted like butter. On top of the great food, our waitress was the sweetest ever. So kind and helpful, I think her name was Autumn. We noticed that they're open til 2 am! So this would be the perfect spot for a late night snack. I believe they have a late night happy hour starting after 10. Needless to say, we will definitely be going back! Also must mention that I loved the environment, very trendy and cool inside. Not too loud.",

    "text": "When more than 400 Yelpers are telling you to give Delux a try, you should probably listen!  While there really isn't anything unique about this small modern burger bar, Delux comes up where it needs to; it offers up a delicious burger.  There are only two on the menu (the Delux burger and the classic standard burger), but my party of four ordered them in a different way, and no one complained.  I had the classic burger cooked medium with swiss cheese.  When it arrived at the table I cut the burger in half, and saw (then tasted) a perfectly medium cooked patty.  I didn't recognize any crazy seasoning or added flavor to the beef, which is a good thing.  I like knowing that I'm eating a premium beef that doesn't require anything more than a pinch of salt and pepper.  And the brioche bun; out of this world!  My table also ordered a basket of regular and sweet potato fries.  The fries come in cool little shopping cart baskets.  Go for the sweet potato fries and dip them in the special aioli, you won't regret it, the fries are crispy and the aioli has a wonderful sweetness that compliments them quite well.  And if you're looking for a quality drink to go with your food, Half of Delux's menu is alcohol.  There's a massive selection of micro brews and imports on tap.  How can you go wrong?  Not into burgers?  There's also a few cool looking sandwiches and salads.  Put off by the location being in a strip mall?  Welcome to Phoenix.  That's where the best local spots are.",

    "text": "This is not going to be a great review but I want to start by saying I LOVE the burgers and other things at Delux.  The problem is that the service has often been poor; not always but more often than it has been good.  The most consistent good service has been at the bar, especially when Boston is there; she's awesome.    For example, my wife and I went for lunch last week.  Server #1 took our order and she also asked for a diet coke which never came.  After about 10 minutes, server #2 was passing by so I asked if she could get the diet coke that we'd been waiting on; she said she would but never did.  Server #3 brought our food; good teamwork, I thought, until he walked away without asking if we needed anything else.  Both our waters were empty and we still didn't have the diet coke.  Shouldn't that just be automatic to ask a table when you deliver food?  It was when I was in the service industry.  Still, I try to cut servers a lot of slack because sometimes it's just poor training and a good attitude helps which they do have.  Anyway, at this point I finally got up to ask the 2nd server if we could get that diet coke plus water refills which we finally got.  I ordered the Mahi-mahi sandwich instead of my usual Delux burger; nothing special and wasn't worth 14.00, I'm sorry to say.  Just kind of blah.    Server #1 finally came at the end and apologized for being in the weeds and thanked us for our patience.  The place wasn't that busy, though, so I was wondering why he was behind the bar and with tables on the opposite side where the booths are.  Ok, so on to a different issue: gift cards.  I received a 50.00 gift card, used about 35.00 of it, then found out that they don't issue a new one for the balance.  Instead they asked me to fill out a form with my address so they can mail me a check!  Well, 8 weeks went by and no check.  We saved our copy and gave it to our waiter, Eric, who did a good job, by the way.  After much run-around from our manager he got the balance taken off our bill; nice job Eric!  Don't buy gift cards from here until they get a better system!  Finally, we've given up ordering our favorite sushi roll, the Tempura Shrimp, because  of the lack of coordination between kitchen and sushi bar.  Twice now, the roll took more than 25 minutes to get to our table.  I wish I could remember that server's name during the 2nd episode because he was awesome; great attitude.   So to end on a positive note the Delux burger is seriously one of the best I've ever had; love the fries, too.  I also love that they have such a great craft/import beer selection and that they DON'T carry Bud, Miller, Coors or any of that crap (I'm a beer snob.)  There is some stiff competition, though, from Ingo and others but we're still giving Delux our business; I just hope they implement some better training for some of the staff.",

    "text": "Visited Delux on our \"babymoon\" roadtrip through AZ in May.  I'm typically not a huge meat eater but, being pregnant clearly had an impact on my eating habits (needed more iron in my diet).    We checked out Yelp for the Scottsdale area and saw fantastic reviews so decided to give it a try.  We were not disappointed, in fact we're now super bummed that we don't have one out here in CA.    I had the Classic burger (would have loved the Delux but, was off the gruyere due to bebe) husband did have the Delux and we split the half and half sweet potato / regular fries.  We agreed these were hands down the best burgers we've had at a restaurant. Super fresh meat, super fresh produce, even the rolls they were on were outstanding.  Fries were tasty as well.    Not only was the food outstanding but, the on tap selection of beer was incredibly impressive.  Then top it off with outstanding service - this place really is the whole package.  Our server (wish I could remember his name) was super helpful - answered all my crazy pregnant lady questions, actually walked me over to the take out side of the business to find a pasteurized juice (he looked at the labels with me!), was extremely knowledgable about the beers and without being asked, brought samples of a few the hubby inquired about so he could sample them; this after the hubby had ordered a pint of one he recommended.  The management of this place clearly know what they are doing.    I wish wish wish we had places like this out here in our neck of the woods (\"the counter\" has really lost their edge).  Next time we're in AZ we will definitely be back (and I'll be ordering that Delux burger!)",

We shared a romantic mini shopping cart of french fries over a bright blue glowing table.  The Bar is lined with a great selection of Beer and I very much so enjoyed my wine.   I had the Turkey Burger, which I never do, but I was trying to appear more health conscious to my new beau.  It was the first Vege Burger Ive ever truly enjoyed! It was so juicy and cooked to perfection.  My boyfriend had the cheesburger which he devoured and in the few bites it took him to down his dinner, he made \"Mmmmm\" noises the entire time with his eyes closed as if he was in Burger Heaven.   The Staff was pretty attentive, and the open kitchen kept things interesting with the occasional flames of fire catching my eye.  The lighting was great, the music was good, the TVs had the right games on and even with all of that going on the mood was quiet and serene with a touch of intimate.  My only semi negative review is the location.  Its in a little shopping center, next to a Safeway and a frozen yogurt spot. A place like this deserves a more swanky, downtown feeling location with a nice view.   My boyfriend lives out of town but we go to Delux every time he's back to visit! Its our favorite Date Night Place with a twist of our own romantic sentimental value.   I recommend Delux  *Said So By Starr",

The first thing I noticed was the ridiculous amount of beers they have on tap. As I sat down, I proceeded to count and they had 40 different beers on tap. FORTY. I've NEVER seen that many in my life!! That's raw -- way to go Delux.  DELUX BURGER (the first one on the menu) - Um, YEAH IT HIT THE SPOT. I wasn't brave enough to try the cheese that was on the burger so I swapped it for some melted cheddar. The waitress even suggested I do that if I wasn't bold enough to try this two cheese mix that was supposed to go on the burger. Shrug.   FRENCH FRIES - Kinda tasted like McDonalds...so it was GOOD.  SWEET POTATO FRIES - This is a MUST ORDER.  Anyway, your fries come in a cute small shopping cart w/ a side of ketchup and I believe what was a chipotle mayo sauce. It was tasty nonetheless and the chipotle mayo sauce tasted magnificent on your burger.  This place can get somewhat pricey but it was $10 for an orgasmic burger. YUM. Definitely a cute place to go on a casual date.  (Photos uploaded)",

It's the only thing I have had there before and those are still good. The burger though? No flavor... I asked for it minus the arugula (not a fan of the stuff) and I realized after I had left disappointed that they also managed to leave the bacon off. I certainly didn't ask for that. If that had been on there it might have been a little better. But even then I don't think it would have been a good burger.

The restrooms are fresh and clean.  I loved it.  We ordered two Delux drafts and a double chocolate stout.  The lights come on.  The waiter urges us strongly to do a shot.  We knew it was a bad idea.  No go.  Then came the freshly baked cookies [<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NJ0RzuWd5xDqfJejYQZ65g?select=RWLEGQXa2ss05mth8fxn-w%5D\">yelp.com/biz_photos/NJ0R...</a>.  So enticing.  The waiter says no free cookie until you take a shot.  We really wanted the cookies.  In the end, no shot, free cookies.  Extra star for service!",

They also have Lindemann's Framboise on top (raspberry lambic), which my wife loves.  Delux Burger is fantastic.  Try it as a lettuce wrap so that you can pretend it is somewhat healthy.  I really like their carmelized onions.  My only complaint is the 'bun' - it gets oddly soggy if I eat too slowly.",

    "text": "The Delux Burger gets the reward for being the juiciest burger I have ever eaten. This thing is like a meat sponge that's soaked up all the grease from the grill and the blood from the cow and it's quite amazingly awesome! Everyone knows that to have a good burger, you have to have good quality beef, which means humanely raised grass-fed cows. None of that grain-fed crap or that mad-cow cannibalism.   Also, be sure to ask for some extra aioli sauce because the burger is in desperate need of a condiment.  Restaurant itself is actually quite small so I could definitely see it becoming super crowded during the rush eating hours. But we went in-between lunch and dinner so we were promptly seated.   Kk the decorum was kind of gorgeous! Whoever designed this place has a flair for life and urbanism! The place has a very neon club lighting kind of style. And even though it's not at all subtle, it's still not over-the-top and in your face. The place glows with a blue light that enchants more than dazzles. Dig it, dig it, dig.",

Despite the cool ambience and delicious food, the managerial staff is below average and, in fact, makes me not want to come back. Being so that I work in the restaurant industry and have been for years, it's easy for me to distinguish between an effective management staff and one that isn't. I even watched them pull one of their employees aside last night and interrogate her about what seemed to be a complaint or bad review or something right in front of us! I have ordered togo before from this employee who has well exceeded my expectations in the past and am shocked. A few times before I have had encounters with the managers who have badgered me and truthfully, creeped me out and I am not about to spend my money here again when the managers seem to be as shady as they come. I will miss this place!",

Anyway my friend suggested this spot because of their sweet potato fries...that's all she had to say, I was down!! It's a trendy little spot inside of a strip mall, it kinda looked outta place but it stood out in a good way.  I ordered the sweet potato fries they were yummy (I like mine a little crispier, but they were still delish)  and the CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD...Mmmmmm the flavors were amazing, the red peppers, cilantro, romaine and that peanuty vinaigrette is too die for! I was a little worried that I wasn't going to get full but this salad was easily large enough for 2.I'm ashamed to say that the 3 times that I have been to Delux I have had this salad, I'm hooked. Next time I promise I will venture out and try one of these burgers everyone keeps raving about...maybe.",

    "text": "\"Ode to the salad\" Two words: In-vogue.  Delectable burgers, Exceptional Salad... When you think Burger, the first thing that comes to mind is a hands-on, unpolished, All-American type of fare. Delux is the sheik fashionista of the burger world.   Excellent brew selection: \"beer flights\" are amazing.   You can't go wrong with a Delux Burger, but that isn't what keeps me coming back folks. Are you ready for this? SALAD. That's right, salad.  You're probably thinking, \"Wow this guy gets a salad at a burger joint\" but I ensure you, The DELUX CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD will change your life. It reduced me to a confused, pathetic, blubbering oaf for days, maybe weeks until I returned for another. If you must have a burger, PLEASE, do yourself a favor and get the Chinese chicken salad on the side (but be warned, its siren call can tame the most pompous of meat loving men.)  And remember to get a basket of \"MIXED FRIES\", that way; you can try both the sweet potato and regular. Together, they're an unstoppable force of dynamic excellence. One of my favorite late night dinner stops. Eat well, Live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do. - Cheers",

Their veggie sandwich is pretty much just mozzarella on bread.  And their fish sandwich is really weak.  There's just absolutely nothing memorable (except for the funny aftertaste) or interesting about it.  The fish is supposed to be marinated in some kind of citrus vinaigrette, but it's quite tasteless.  None of the salads have ever seemed appealing, so I haven't tried them.  I really wish they had a veggie burger, because I bet it would be quite yummy.    And their fries are okay, but they're skinny - and very fried.  But the sauces they come with are tasty.

    "text": "It was a burger kind of night, and we searched high and low on Yelp for \"Best Burger\" and found this place. Based on reviews, we decided to give it a shot.  It was a bit of a gamble considering we drove in from Scottsdale, but it was pretty good.  The vibe is pretty hip and swanky inside, with lighted up tables in the center row, but we opted to sit outside in the misted patio. Our server took our order for beer. Here is where things kind of went a bit south.  This place has a pretty extensive craft beer selection, with a strong selection of seasonal beers. Our server had NO idea what seasonals were on tap, and had no idea how to describe them once he figured out the list. My tip? Print out a list of seasonal beers and put them on the table.   On the plus side, they offer beer flights for all of their beers, so you can mix and match everything. Awesome sauce.   We shared a turkey burger and the chinese chopped chicken salad. Both were good. The turkey burger was moist and flavorful. Perhaps had a bit too much garlic. The salad was very good, and the portions were very good.  Overall, this was a decent place. I'd maybe give it another shot. There wasn't any huge red flags that said, \"Dave...don't come back.\" BUT, there wasn't anything that said, \"OMFG, Dave...you HAVE to come back next week and bring all of your friends.\"  Final grade. 3 stars. Solid B.",

    "text": "So, maybe I don't get it. Maybe all the hype ruined it for me. Maybe it's gone over my head.   Only...I think I DO get it. This den of would-be Williamsburg-ites is beyond over-rated. Delux should spend less time spelling a word wrong, being lit like the interior of an alien craft, and begging for someone to confuse for them for a restaurant in the hippest part of Brooklyn...and spend more time on decent service, and food to match the lofty expectations set by your atmosphere. Which brings me to the point of all this:  the burger. The burger was, at best, okay. It didn't wow me, but it didn't repulse me either. The meat was tender and well-cooked but aside from that, I'm left wanting more...and honestly, I'm left wanting a lot more. I was led to believe that this burger would blow my socks off and that the fries would be so good, I would order another basket. The only good thing about your poorly seasoned, room temperature fries was the gimmick you delivered them to me in. You could literally hear my eyes rolling. I've had better burgers at plenty of restaurants that also weren't simultaneously clamoring for me to talk about \"how cool they were\". Our waiter was barely present;  I effectively only want to see you once in a while to refill my drink and maybe check in once the food is there...consider the ball dropped. I'd have more to say about this place and why I didn't like it, but I was too busy yawning at Delux's attempts at being \"cool\".  I do get it. You just haven't earned it yet, baby.",

Was greeted by Kristina with a smile and asked what we wanted to drink I had to have a sleepy Dog - Red Rover ... And some more chatting with Kristina helped me pick a beer flight I looked over the menu... I went with the Delux Burger (Blend of premium all natural ground beef topped with maytag and gruyere cheese, organic arugula and caramelized onion and apple wood bacon mixture all on top a toasted bemi-bagueette.  Plus an order of Half combination (sweet and French fries) The burger was really good and the fries as well it was funny the fries come in a little shopping cart made me laugh... This place is a really cool hip place really friendly staff and great craft beer selection will be back for sure.",

MMMM....The flavors of the meat, the onions and cheese came together in perfect harmony. Sweet Potato fries were cooked perfectly. All in all  the food was amazing.  Service: Our server was pretty knowledgeable but had a bit of an attitude upon learning that I had never been there before. As if I should've known what to order before hand.   Decor: Pretty and modern but it smelled kinda musky in there. Like a grandmas house.  I really like this place and will absolutely come back",

Most of the food is pretty good. Their signature burger is good but needs a little ketchup. I've also had the Grilled Chicken Panini which was ok but not great. It just seemed a little bland. The bread that they use is always really good. I love their sweet potato fries and would get it all the time if it wasn't for my expanding waistline. The best thing I've had their is their Chinese Chicken Salad. The serving size is a little ridiculous because it really is made for two people but it comes in one giant serving bowl. Despite the size, it really is delicious. It has the right amount of tang from the dressing and savoriness from the chicken that makes this carnivore skip the burgers and order the salad.  The one drawback about this place is that it's really small. The outdoor patio area is much more comfortable in terms of elbow space but you're sitting on cheap plastic chairs. Inside you'll be lucky if you're not elbow to elbow with the patron next to you.  Love going to this place when the temperature is nice outside and having a convenient low-key dinner, a middle ground between fast food and fancy restaurant.",

Coming from midwest where we have alot ofgreat food and even better burgers so anxious to see what Delux had to offer. Worked late and missed dinner so came out here late to grab a bite and see if Delux was up to snuff. Didnt seem too crowded midweek. One TV over the bar, plenty of open seating. Had a bar with one long table down the middle. I sat in the bankette. Since it was my first time here, tried the Delux burger first to see how it tastes. Like all my burgers well-done and it was cooked to my taste. Burger was fine. Nothing too impressive but better than a fast food joint so no complaints there. Burger was about $10 and with a drink I got out of there about $15ish or so.   Not the cheapest price I've seen but for burgers of higher quality you have to expect to pay a premium. From what I have heard The Grind and charr are similar pricing so I'll be trying those next. For now, Delus isnt bad. Didnt have too big a meal since it was late but will try the others and see which one gets my repeat business as a newbie in town. So far not bad though.",

I'm a sucker for sweet potato fries and of course got the half/half basket- so good. I got the 1/2 caprese salad- taste just like every other place. Boyfriend got roast beef slider and mini burger which he enjoyed. Both great portions. The only bad thing was that our server was obviously sick. She couldn't even get through taking our order naming the cheeses without coughing at least five times. I just hope she washed her hands before touching the plates. It could've been allergies but she had a stuffy nose and legit couldn't stop coughing and it's not attractive when you're handling food.",

Which shows where your priorities are.  Sushi until 11:55 (or earlier maybe) for those of you who don't know. Not 12. Seems minor but pretty disconcerting when you make it to a restaurant before something is cut only to find out they did away with it earlier than they were supposed to.

    "text": "OMG! How did I not know about this spot sooner? First of all, the drinks were delicious with an average price point of $8-12 depending on the time of day and drink. I actually like that my burger didn't come with fries because then I'll actually eat the burger. I'm one of those weirdos that if a side of fries comes with my meal, I MUST eat all the fries first because who likes to eat day old fries? NOBODY that's who!! Now, you can order a side of fries that arrive in the cutest mini grocery cart you've ever seen. So, duh! You've got to order that.  For starters we ordered the hot dog and split it three ways. Best life choice ever. For real. I haven't had a hot dog in years and this was just absolute perfection. Oh, and that pretzel bun. To die for. Seriously.  I ordered the turkey burger, which was absolutely delicious. The burger clearly was made to order in house. The meat was juicy and fresh and oh so flavorful. Side note: the sauce that comes on the side IS cilantro. So, if you're part of the genetic pool that finds cilantro to taste like soap like I do, DO NOT place it all over your top bun.  The fries, both regular and sweet potato were like crack. I couldn't stop. Okay, I've never actually tried crack and I never will, but I imagine that it's a very similar experience. Why do crack when you can eat carts full of fries instead?!?!  I did take half of my burger home simply because it's what I do. The next day it was just as juicy and delicious as it was the night before. An epic feat by anyone's standards.  Other reviews say they've gotten greedy with prices, and while I don't have previous experience to compare to, I didn't find the pricing to be outrageous.  It's True, this spot also does sushi. I'm not a fish eater, thanks again to genetics. But if that's you're thing, my companion who did order the sushi said it was on point. And he doesn't give praise lightly.  The vibe is dark and chic, without feeling overly pretentious. You can watch the game, or anime. The entire staff was friendly and inviting. And I'm pretty sure one of the owners came to check on our table. Which, I've not seen in a very long time and is a particularly touch.",

Good quality beef and super fresh bread make for a pretty great burger. The size is big, but the shape eliminates those awkward moments in trying to hold and take bites without it falling apart.   The fries are awesome as to be expected with an overly addictive aioli (sour cream, mayonnaise, cayenne, and lemon?). The sushi menu is not so expected for a burger joint. But hey - I love sushi so no complaints here.    I also have tried the turkey burger, and I wasn't over the moon. It was good, but not as amazing as their beef. Alas, this is why I will continue to go to those \"others\". However, I will say the delux has the leg up on the beef burger scene.",

I don't like blue cheese so I always substitute the blue cheese/gruyere mixture for cheddar.

The fact that so many people rave about Delux is just another thing I dont understand. I tried this place twice, (I will always try a place twice in case they have an off day) and I was very very disappointed both times. The burger I ordered was $11. ELEVEN DOLLARS FOLKS!!!!! No burger no matter how incredible is worth anywhere near $11. And of course this did not come with frys or anything else. The burger was kinda mushy with no flavor at all. The bun was very plane and did not have the best texture. I also ordered the sweet potato frys and did not like them at all. That was the first time I had ever had those so it could be I just dont like that type of french fry. The second time I ordered the regular frys and they were pretty undercooked with no seasoning.      This place proves my theory, if you make it snooty enough everyone will think its good matter how bad the food is. Delux is nothing but hype. If you want to try a real burger with great flavor and a descent price try Lenny's on Thunderbird and 35th ave. That's what a burger should taste like.",

Or a sweet potato fries swimsuit in a swimming pool of aioli. You get the point. I'm not proud of it. Especially because adding $6 fries to my $9 veggie panini is not a frugal choice. But there is no way I can go to Delux and not get those goddamn fries!  The kitchen is open late 7 days a week. It's wonderful. I can get my fix at 1:30am on a Sunday, even! If You show up near typical dinner time, though, prepare to wait. Try not to stare too hungrily at all the patio diners stuffing their faces with burgers and beer.   The service is usually decent and the food is yummy. But all the bread and cheese and, yes, sweet potato fries, make me feel a little regretful and terribly sleepy afterward.",

And while I don't eat meat and can't try this heralded burger, I did get to try both the grilled vegetable panini (my dish) and the panini grilled cheese (my boyfriend's dish)- and both were delicious.    Of course we had to get fries, but it was a really hard decision on what to get for dessert.  Should we opt for one of the amazing looking shakes we had seen going by on trays to neighboring tables or give in to the call of the GIANT banana split lava cake?  We gave in.  And it was wonderful.  This dessert was meant to share, but every bite I took was worth it.  I can't wait to go back to Delux again to have it, that's for sure.",

It took me a while to get over that fact and give it a decent try.  Among the things Delux has copied from FO is the famous \"Office Burger,\" which Delux calls the \"Delux Burger.\"  They also bring out the fries in a shopping cart just like Father's Office.  What Delux fails to copy, however, is the quality of the food and the high-end nature of the original.  At FO, the wines changed weekly and are all incredibly rare selections.  The beers at FO also tend towards the more obscure.  Delux seems to concentrate almost exclusively on beers and does have a decent selection, but nothing you can't find elsewhere.  Wines are available, but as an afterthought, and definitely not of the quality served at FO.  For Phoenicians who never experienced the joys associated with the original Father's Office, you're missing out.  It's like being an Eric Clapton fan but not even knowing who Muddy Waters is.  But all the imitation aside, I have to say that Delux does a pretty good job with everything and they have taken the FO concept and adapted it to the PHX strip mall environment.    Food wise, everything I have tried was ok.  They did change their sweet potato fries a year or two ago because the other ones weren't \"crispy\" enough.  The problem is that these new crispier ones have no flavor.  When they were testing out the new fries, the manager asked me and a friend to opine and we told him the truth: We said the new ones are flavorless.  I guess we were the only ones who thought so because they went ahead with that change.  That lost them 1 star from this review.  I would rather have the soggier more flavorful ones (who knows how they make these new ones so crispy anyways?).    When I go here, it's almost always out of convenience and late at night.  Not many places of this caliber stay open until 2 am, so it's about all there is when you are in need of a late night meal in this part of town.  Their 2 star rating is based on: clearly knocking off one of my favorite places, Father's Office (minus 1 star) and for ignoring my feedback on the new crispy tasteless sweet potato fries (minus 1 star).  They also lose a star for retaining the FO prices but substituting Phoenix strip mall quality.",

It's a well seasoned and dressed with caramelized onions and arugula on a ciabatta or brioche type roll....And the gazpacho - this is one of the valley's best gazpacho's.  Considering there are 130+ reviews on this place - it strikes me odd to not see any comments about their seating and ambiance. Delux is little. At one point, they seemed to have realized how great they were doing, and smooshed every possible table,booth and chair together to try and squeeze every last possible patron.  D's ToGo (next door) is a great concept, but it seems that space could be programmed better. Utilize curbside or call ahead pickup instead of cramming us in the main area like sardines.  And although trendy and stylish, if this were anything but \"Delux\", we would all be yelping about their shameless exaggeration of their logo and branding. Just take a look at how many Ds you see floating around the restaurant...We get it - we're at Delux, eating Delux burgers, going to Delux bathrooms, ordering Delux beer, wiping our asses with Delux toilet paper.  It's a FUN place with GREAT beer, though.... Remember that!  Oh yea, their fries are good. Not great. And a bit overpriced... And so many people have sweet potato fries now, I wouldn't be surprised if I saw something new starting to accompany the burgers....",

Everyone I know raves about their burgers and I thought I was in for a real treat. I scanned the menu and decided to go with the Delux burger and a basket of fries to share with my sister. The beer selection here is 5 stars. Unfortunately they were out of sunshine wheat beer so I settled for a beer suggested by our waiter. I think it was Papago? The beer was so good it made me forget about sunshine wheat! Our fries were delivered before our burger. I tried to practice self control and wait till my burger arrived but I caved in. The fries were great! I love the aoli sauce that comes with it. Then my burger arrived. I took my first bite and was NOT impressed. In fact I was disgusted because it smelled weird. I don't know if it's the organic meat that they use or what but I took one bite and had the waiter box it up so I could give it to my dad. He'll eat anything. I enjoyed the rest of my beer and fries and still left a happy camper. I'd come back for drinks but not anytime soon.",

I normally don't like sweet potato fries, but they are really good.  Cause they are savory and not way sweet like the way most people serve them.  The meat is also cooked properly, I hate when I order a Medium burger and a friend orders a medium well and it's the same thing.",

    "text": "besides the old fav of most AZ/88, Delux is one of the best burgers in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. in a strip mall with Gelato Spot, Zen/32 and the huge Safeway, it's found it's niche for hip. not many restaurants are beyond the strip center/mall in AZ, but you have to go inside to see if the spot is for you.   i have been going to Delux for a few years now since it opened and have always had good food there. and the major PLUS here is the GINORMO selection of brews that they have - probably about 20+ on tap and seasonal brews as well. the shopping cart with regular or sweet potato fries or a mix of both was cute at first, but now i'm over it.  what i order: - the beet salad (note: not just beets, there is lettuce in there too) - the standard burger either a lettuce wrap or the normal way (really if you're trying to cut down on bread, the lettuce wrap is pretty damn good) - mix of fries, although compared to my fav restaurant in chicago Rockit's sweet potato fries, Delux's are a little soggy and limp like that guy from 'revenge of the nerds' trying to throw a football  it's a cool spot and is open LATE NIGHT...big plus and hard to find in this area (note: the place is small, seating is tight, but there is outdoor seating as well)",

    "text": "\"If the melting pot exists, the cheeseburger may well be its most palpable product; to take a bite of it is to take a bite of history...\"  -Elizabeth Rozin, Primal Cheeseburger  Who could argue with that statement? Checked out Delux Burger today; Delux is a burger joint that gets some serious buzz and numerous Best Burger awards from the local media. They are also a late night favorite since they serve food until 2 AM. This gives them street credit in my opinion.  The mystery dining companion, otherwise known as L. joined me for this burger excursion this evening; we arrived around 10:00 PM for a late supper. The seating is a bit cramped in the dining room and the patio. The Delux menu is very nicely limited, meeting my personal rule for just do what you do best. We both ordered the signature entree, the \"Delux Burger\"($9.5), starring a half-pound of freshly ground Harris Ranch beef; supporting cast includes a toasted demi baguette topped with Maytag and Gruyere cheeses, sweet caramelized onions, applewood smoked bacon and organic arugula. We also ordered the Combination Fries \"a la cart\" ($6) which came out before the Burgers. The fries were fantastic! They were served in a mini shopping cart (making them easy to share) and included french and sweet potato fries. Two sauces were also included with the fries, a standard ketchup and a house aioli which resembled a thousand island type sauce with some kick.   The burgers came out shortly after the fries. They were impressive looking before we took the first bite - robust in size and the beef was perfectly cooked. Delux recommends to order their burgers at medium rare allowing them to showcase the juiciness of the beef; L. and I ordered our burgers medium and they were prepared perfectly. As we bit into these works of art, the beefy goodness oozed wonderful flavor onto our palate. The beef truly is the star of this show, however supporting cast complements it nicely without taking away from the magnificent flavor of the beef. This burger really hit the spot.  I was able to command and conquer this burger, however L. was only able to master one half and took the other half home. Adam from Man Vs. Food would have been so disappointed with her. A few other good factors that Delux offers: Good service, fantastic beer selection, which are primarily microbrews from across the country, and reasonable prices. If Delux has a weakness, it's an atmosphere that's a bit trendy and possibly even slightly pretentious, but the burgers are so good that it's overruled.  Overall, a fantastic experience... and another bite into burger history.",

It felt ultra hip and trendy. The menu is very minimalist, but I immediately found something that peaked my taste buds.  My hot and sexy male waiter came over stared me and my friend in the eyes and took our order. We ordered mixed fries for the appetizer, which is a mix of sweet potatoe and brown potatoe fries with aioli sauce. they arrived in a tiny lil shopping cart, which was so cute my friend and i both took pictures with it. I ordered a delux burger because it came with gruyere cheese and I'd never heard of this cheese. I requested my buger not have bacon and well done. Another hot and sexy male waiter delivered our food and agin flirted with us. My burger was delicious. My friend and I were very impressed with the attractiveness of the waiters, we even left them a special love note because we are immature in that way, but we tip well to make up for it. I would return to Delux for both the food and great service.",

They actually recommend that you get your burger cooked medium-rare, which was perfectly fine with me since that's how I like my steak cooked. The ground beef was really high quality, too, so I definitely see why they recommend you order it that way. The only thing was that the bottom bun got crazy soggy. I ended up just getting rid of it all together. I love sweet potato fries and love how you can choose to order them mixed with regular potato fries, which is what I did. To be honest, the fries really weren't THAT amazing, but they were also only $3. Oh yeah, you also have to buy the fries separately. This isn't a place for penny pinchers, but it's also not super expensive considering the quality of the burger you are getting. No, it's not a spot to go to all the time, but if you're looking to get out and try a good quality burger, definitely go for it. I'd say it's worth it!",

The menu is pretty simple, and the drink list surprisingly offers a rather large selection.  I'm not a big burger eater, so I ordered the grilled chicken panini.  It came on a grilled baguette topped with cheese and veggies.  It was fantastic, and huge--I took half of it home for lunch today.  I liked that there was seating both inside and out--since it's about to get a million degrees out, we opted to sit outside on the patio and enjoy the nice weather.  It was Monday night, so it was incredibly slow, but our service was still great.  My girlfriends both ordered the burger, and definitely enjoyed it.  A glass of wine was very reasonable at $6 each and our sandwiches/burgers were each about $10.  Considering I got two meals out of it, I think that's a great deal!  Because it was my friend's birthday, the server brought out a complimentary ice cream sundae, which I thought was sweet.  If I ever am craving a burger, I will have to come back",

My friend & I decided to forgo the 5 minute wait to sit inside (because I was THAT hungry) and were seated right away on the patio. Yes, it was hot as hell and the misters didn't do much,  but I just needed to be fed ASAP!   I had my usual (Delux burger), my friend had the turkey burger and we shared an order of sweet potato fries. I'm really glad he got the turkey burger because I've always wanted to try it, but was always hesitant to order it in case it sucked. It actually turned out to be really good! I'll probably order it the next time I'm there. And the sweet potato fries are so nice & crispy!!! I almost didn't order them because the past several times (last year) the fries were limp (even when I requested them to be well-done/crispy). I guess they finally got a clue and now I heart their fries.. yummy!   Our waitress, Jessica, was great. She was really helpful, friendly and always made sure our drinks were topped off.",

My most recent trip, took a business partner for lunch.  Wait was negligible at 12:30, and the staff was fantastically friendly and attentive.  Water refills are a luxury on a 95 degree day, and they were on the ball.  They have a great drink menu, including some fun beers that go well with the burgers.  I got the house lager this time, which was crisp and clean for the toasty day.  Burger is to die for--I think it's gruyere, caramelized onions and a baguette.  Skipped the fries this time and got the beet salad--perfection with goat cheese and candied pecans.  Reasonably priced--$25 for Beer, salad and burger.  Sweet!",

Delux is good, atmosphere is cool, service is great, and if you sit at the long high top'd table you will make friends with the people sitting next to you.  Their Sweet Potato fries are bombDOTcom....the aioli that comes with them is amazing, I would put it on everything if I had a bottle of it at home.  Had the Delux Burger...flavor wise it had everything going for it, and everything that I've heard people rave about.....BUT 1 thing: it was madly overcooked, kinda killed it for me.  I normally get my burger's medium, but I know you should get the Delux burger med-rare, so I sprung for it and it came out close to well done :(  It's the only thing holding me back from giving it that extra star....",

I would recommend they put a little \"deluxe\" license plate on them so at least they get extra advertising when people see it at someone's house. Or maybe look into buying a bunch and make them available for purchase. People amaze me. Bad karma momma!!",

But if I hadn't had that burger mere days before I had Delux's burger, then I would say this is the greatest.  The difference?  Father's Office is aged beef.  And I didn't taste that in the burger at Delux.  The Delux has carmelized onions, arugla, and seemed a little bit over cooked. If I hadn't had the recent experience, I would say it was way up there. I would try to order a different bun or maybe it get it with the lettuce wrap because I didn't really think the foccacia went with the burger. I think it's fun they served the fries in shopping carts (maybe it's a trendoid yuppie thing).  My friend who had the salad said there wasn't enough nuts in it for protein.  Hmm, possibly this is not the place to go if you're vegetarian.   My other friend who had a walker had a lot of trouble maneuvering in and out of the tight table the put us at near the front and though the staff was trying to be nice, they didn't know how to deal with it.    My friends also felt it was really loud but I didn't think it was.  Maybe my hearing is gone.  Wha?",

If free-range fresh organic sirloin isn't enough, they mix in gruyere and gorgonzola, and top the thing with caramelized onions, bacon and ARUGULA! The plate comes with beautiful little grated curls of carrot and beet-root which are tasty atop the burger. Don't be a weenie and order a plain burger! Order the Delux. Medium rare.  Ask for extra chile aioli, you will want it for the sweet potato fries, trust me! The sweet potato fries are delicious, but I only order them to share because I am pretty sure this is a half pound burger and the fries for me alone are way too much food. The beet salad is also very good. Order the Delux Burger! Chimay on tap, so this COULD get spendy folks.   This ain't McDonalds.   The place can get annoyingly crowded and loud. It is very popular. try to get an outside table if you can.",

The only reason why I even gave it 3 stars was because it's one of few restaurants that is open until 2:00 AM and the interior is nicely decorated. It actually looked like a fun place to grab drinks but not the burgers. After reading reviews about Delux, I was excited to try a \"gourmet\" burger. Instead, I ended up with their \"Delux\" burger, which the meat was tasteless and overly greasy by itself. The burger was minimally saved by some of the savory toppings like grilled onions. The bun was grilled (drenched) with butter. We actually split the burger and fries and boy was I glad!   The day after my burger experience, my stomach reminded me that Delux is just not the place for me.",

Always have been. The deluxe burger is great if you want something different. Extremely rich and delicious. The classic is good if you are more of a ketchup and mustard kinda burger eater. It was always too much food for me so I was sooo happy to see the addition of the mini burgers, woohoo.  And...you can just buy one if that's all you want. I wish they had the deluxe burger available in mini too.  As a frequent take out person, I was sorry to see the 2 go side slowly disappear. Now you have to walk in through the middle of diners eating and it's a little awkward. Then the to go counter completely disappeared and was replaced by a sushi bar. This I think is weird. If you want to do sushi, do it in another spot. You are trying to squeeze too much under one roof.   Also, my last take out order had extremely soggy sweet potato fries. They were cold, floppy and inedible. I didn't take away a star for this because it's the first time it happened. But, come on. Every drive through in town can provide warm crispy fries...so can you. They are amazing when done right!  Go here if you want a great burger and fries. The root beer and beet salad are also very good.",

For a fat kid who grew up in Idaho / Utah, this is an absolute staple when it comes to fry consumption.  The only reason this place doesn't get a 5th star is, the signature burger, while tasty, came out with a grease soaked bottom bun.  This leads to the sog-factor, which is a texture I find intolerable in the burger kingdom.  I'm sure it's not easy to make a burger patty WITH bacon mixed in non-soggy, but maybe a grilled bun, or some lettuce under the patty would help with this.  Either way, I will be back, and look forward to it!!",

My go-to is the classic burger, medium-rare, with a slice of cheddar and crispy bacon. It's always cooked to perfection, juicy and delicious. You really can taste the quality of the Neiman Ranch meat (burger & bacon). What really sets this place apart, however, is the fries & aoli. They say the fries are for sharing but my boyfriend and I always require 2 baskets and extra aoli. Both the regular and the sweet potato are to die for! Great beer selection too, really what more could you want than good beer, fries, and burgers??",

Giant selection of beer. Got a couple of samples and then had a new one (Green River Street something) that was really good. The selection is really varied so you should definitely find one you'll like.  Really nice seating & decor.",

Unfortunately probably won;t be back in AZ for a while so they may never redeem themselves in my book!  We went for the beers and burgers and beet salad I had read so much about. First off, when we order the waiter tells us the fan is out for the night so theres no beer AT ALL.... they advertise their beer and burgers like crazy- you'd think there was a sign or someone would tell us before we were seated!  Anyways, the beet salad I got was very good. The beets and walnuts and arugula and all that jazz were crispy and refreshing and the dressing they use is very subtle so you can really enjoy those veggies. Also had the low-carb roll... it was good, but nothing special- served me right for ordering sushi at a burger joint. My boyfriend got the Delux burger. he LOVED it. the bun, the burger, the toppings- all of it was right up his alley and no wonder their burgers have been rated the best!",

I got to try the clasic delux burger itself and it was quite amazing, incredibly juicy and cooked just how i like it. We also got the lightly seasoned original fries as well which were just as good as the sweet potato ones. i also got to try the turkey burger which was also juicy and flavorful, along with the chicken panini which was incredibly tasty.  it was a great lunch every one i was with enjoyed themselves and I am glad my friend recommended it.",

    "text": "Delux perhaps defined the entire summer I spent in Phoenix. I have only fond memories of this place.  Hip: let's get this out of the way first. Yes, from the blue and black lights in funky round balls atop the bar to the center table with stools to the booths along the side, the interior oozes of cool. I am particularly picky about where I sit in restaurants, but I tried pretty much every seat in the house here and I will say they're all great for whatever matches your mood. The place is small inside, and there's sometimes waits during peak hours/weekends.   The hours. This is what really made Delux...well, deluxe for me. It's open so late, and I loved coming here for a more mellow nightcap on weekends. The drink list is superb (essentially, the food consists of one page and the drinks are the other 7 pages of the menu) and I always found the bartender to prepare our drinks well and quickly.  Now, the food. Burgers. Are. Delicious. They are basically your high class, uber-chic and swanky burgers with impeccable presentation. I was impressed. I must say I'm sold on not only the image but also the taste. The perfect ratio of protein-carb-toppings. I would highly suggest pretty much any of their burgers, but start with their Delux Burger. It's the staple. As for the sides, yes, the fries (sweet potato AND regular) are tasty and adorable, coming in this little shopping cart, which makes it perfect to share. They are, likewise, delicious. Also, they don't make you feel like you need to go run a marathon or your heart might give out on you, so that was always a huge incentive for me to indulge.  Service has always been good here on the whole. Sometimes, naturally, during the busy times it can get a little slow and you can feel slightly neglected, but hopefully your company and/or the food will ease the pain.  I miss Delux. A LOT. I am also dying to try their cupcakes, which weren't part of the menu when I was last there...",

We were in hamburger mode and Delux was just what we were looking for.  The atmosphere was trendy, busy but not packed and overall had a good vibe. We sat in the outside patio area after a short 20 min wait on a Friday night. I immediately liked the place just on their drinks menu. I really appreciated the fact that they are descriptive about their drink selections. Nice touch indeed.  So I got the turkey burger and it was pretty good even though I wasn't digging the bun too much. We got a mix portion of the sweet and regular potato fries in what seems to be their signature container - the mini shopping cart. Overall the food was above average and worthy of high praise.  I plan to visit the Phoenix area from time to time and I certainly will need a repeat visit to Delux. They were just that good!",

A large bar/table is in the center of the restaurant, highlighted with blue lights. This place oozes of sleek.  But enough about the lighting, onto the food!  I got the Delux burger, which was incredible. Medium rare beef, served up on arugula with gruyere and a mixture of onions and bacon was incredible. The bun, a super soft baguette style was incredible as well.   Juice dripped from this burger. Not grease, but juice.  Pure, delicious, incredible, beef juice. If I could bottle and sell it, I would.  My fiance had the turkey burger, which was excellently spiced, a tad dry, but the aioli helped cover that dryness.  Their fries were also tasty, I enjoyed the ketchup and aioli. However, I have had better sweet potato fries.  Their beer selection is awesome, including selections from 4 Peaks, I had an excellent Kolsch-style lager, that complemented my burger well.  The prices are a little high, but the burger does make it worth it, both size and quality  On a final note,I wouldn't recommend coming here at night, it seems like over priced drinks, loud music, and lots of stuck up people.",

    "text": "Any review of Delux requires an obligatory mention of the Los Angeles landmark restaurant Father's Office, whose concept was all but completely plagiarized by Delux. I always say, though, it doesn't matter who came up with the idea, it matters who executes it. And, I like how Delux executes the concept. High-end burgers, delicious craft beer selection and great service in a cozy (and hip) location.  Of course, I have to be the weirdo -- I am also a vegetarian, so I can't have a burger anyway. Instead, I grabbed the amazing grilled cheese, which they grill panini-style, cut into quadrants. The baguette, as usual, was perfectly toasty, firm, yet chewy. There is a great variety of craft beers -- everything from Alaskan Amber to Stone IPA. The service is always good, although this time our server was particularly flirty. He actually sat down with my dining companions and I to chit chat. It was charming and fun and certainly added to the fun (and enjoyment) of the meal.  Another mandatory purchase at Delux is the fries -- available in sweet potato, regular, or half and half. The fries are served in a mini shopping cart (familiar to anyone who has been to Father's Office). They are perfectly seasoned and served with a delicious aioli dipping sauce.  Delux is a perfect place to have a sandwich and day drink on a warm afternoon, and I am looking forward to the temperature cooling off so I can waste a few Sundays there. And, of course, Delux is open till 2 a.m., so it is a great option for late nights as well.",

I was a little nervous about the strip mall location, but then I remembered \"this is Phoenix.\"  We showed up around 11:30 on a Sunday night. The place was packed, but they had a seat for us.

I always go with the Standard Classic Burger, cheddar, extra pickles.  Love it!  One thing to watch out for though - the last time I was there I asked for my burger medium and my dining partner ordered medium rare.  The burgers came out more like well done and medium well.  If this type of thing matters to you, stress to your waitress that you really do want it cooked the way you say you do.  Then again, it could have been an off night.  I love their sweet potato fries - a guilty pleasure that's also good for you.  Delux has a great beer selection too and I've found that the beer flights are the way to go.  The servings are generous and you get to try a few before committing to one.  For those who fear commitment, this is the place to be.  I've never made it to desert so I can't comment.  Finally, try to get there early or late, ahead or behind the crowd.  Delux is always busy at lunch and dinner time and I've almost always had to wait.",

I often find myself here for an impromptu girl's night out, and the ambiance is just fantastic. Plus, they're open late, which is great for those late night cravings! I crave their French fries probably three times a week, they are THAT good. And the aioli sauce that they serve with the fries tastes so amazing, I have never been able to find another aioli even remotely close to being as good as that. Great ... now I'm craving them again! :)",

    "text": "Delux seemed a little yuppie for me, but we tried it anyways after my friend kept raving about it. I got the original Delux burger with the caramelized onions and whatnot on it. I liked the soft baguette it came on; but at the same time when I want a burger I want a BURGER, you know? So one of those oversized buns would have been better, I think. We shared an order of the sweet potato and regular fries, which were good with that aoili dip that comes with it. They were crispy and thin cut, which I liked.   I was disappointed with their small selection of burgers. I like variety. But they did offer salads (the chinese chicken salad, by the way, is great) and I think a few other items. On the plus side, they're open to 2am... and they have cool bathrooms if that counts for anything.",

We sat in Jacquelines station and she got our drinks right away and Mom ordered a beet salad that was very, very good. Lots of beet strings and candied pecans. The dressing was a tad heavy and blue cheese was powerful but that salad was awesome nonetheless. I had the Delux burger with caramelized onions, cheese, arugula and perfectly cooked patty on a roll. I thought it was fantastic. We got the mixed fries on the side and it was a healthy portion with a fry sauce and ketchup on the side. Service was great, food was great....what more can you ask for?

Walking in, I was taken by the trendy lighting and decor along with cozy booths that make the place feel intimate despite the open design.  Quick and attentive service was consistent during our whole meal.  Our party ordered the Bruschetta as a starter and a Delux Basket of Mixed Fries to share. The Bruschetta was wonderful; crispy baguette slices topped with perfectly textured tomatoes. I could have eaten just that for dinner and been happy. The Mixed Fries were good - I was especially surprised that the sweet potato fries were crispy. The accompanying housemade sauce was delicious.  For our main eats we ordered The Classic and Delux Burgers. Our pescetarian friend ordered a California Roll, Shrimp Tempura, and Spicy Tuna.  My burger (the Delux) was delicious. The burger had a nice, perfectly seasoned flavor, and a good amount of chew texture-wise. I especially enjoyed the caramelized onions and applewood bacon that top the Delux Burger. If I'm ever in Phoenix again I'd order another for sure.  Two of use decided to ring in the New Year with Deluxtinis. If you're looking for something that is sweet and packs a roundhouse kick to the senses, get the Deluxtini.  Orange flavored vodka, peach schnapps, pineapple juice, and champagne are all mixed up and served to you in a classic martini glass. This drink is STRONG, and if you don't enjoy the taste of vodka it might be off-putting; if you are into drinks that aren't too sweet but have a lot of fruity flavor I'd recommend the Deluxtini.  All in all, Delux left a great impression on me. The food was good, and we had great service. If I lived in the area, it'd be a regular happy hour spot as they have not one, but two!",

Everything seems to be so far away from each other compared to California. Anyways onto the food:   Chocolate milkshake- my bf ordered this and it was so thick and creamy! It was absolutely delicious and is a total must!  Deluxe burger- I switched out the bleu cheese for Swiss. The baguette bread was so soft and just the way I like it. The meat was so juicy and tender (I had it in medium rare).  Regular and sweet potato fries- it came out in little carts and was so cute! I like the regular fries more tho Vegas roll- my little cousin ordered this and we should've known better than to order sushi at a burger joint.... It wasn't good and got very old easily. She didn't even finish it.  California hand roll- she enjoyed this, but how can anyone mess up such a simple entree.  Classic burger- bf loved it and seemed happy with his choice  Decor Very trendy place! I'm not use to a burger joint being so hipster. Looked more like a bar for me. It was pretty cool though!  It was a bit on the expensive side for burgers. I don't usually eat burgers so maybe that's why? For 3 people, it was $66-76 excluding tip.",

    "text": "I first came here several years ago before I was a yelper.  The delux burger haunted my dreams as the best burger I've maybe ever had.  Since then, I've had many high end burgers, so I was thinking, it's probably not as good as I remember and I've built it up in my mind.  Nope!  It's still awesome and totally lived up to the anticipation.    So what makes the Delux Burger so great, well it starts off with very high grade Niman Ranch Beef.  You want this burger to be nice and pink so order it medium rare.  It's such a juicy burger that the beef itself creates a sauce that is soaked into what they call a demi baguette.  This is a perfect bun.  It's shaped like a mini sub roll and the burger is also rectangular so you have burger covering every inch of the roll.  You would expect something called a baguette to be crunchy on the outside, but this isn't.  It's nice and soft, yet firm enough not to fall apart.  The cheese on this burger is an interesting mix of may tag bleu cheese and gruyere.  I felt on this visit, there could have been a little more cheese, so next time I'm ordering extra chese for sure.  The burger is also topped with a blend of caramelized onions and chopped up smoked applewood bacon.  The only veggie is baby arugula.  It is perhaps tossed in a little olive oil first, but I'm not sure.  You don't add on or take off from this burger, as it's perfection.  They brought some ketchup and mayo but it takes away from the flavor.  The juices from the beef along with the caramelized onion bacon mixture makes sure the burger is in no way dry.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delux-phoenix?select=9-u-8vM2cZKHwQYG00yZ4w#ORnSlQsuz19YA5juttyufQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/delu...</a>  Now if you live in Los Angeles, this burger may be familiar to you.  It's called the Father's Office Burger.  And truthfully Delux Burger ripped it off.  But this is better hands down.  I've had a few father's office burgers in between my first and last Delux Burger and it's not even close.  They have perfected it here.  They even stole the A La Carte Fries idea served in a little mini shopping cart.  But let's just call it an homage, because the fries are way better at Delux too.  We got the mixed sweet potato and regular fries.  Perfectly seasoned, crispy, but still potatoey.  I'm not sure which I liked better, so I love that you can get a mix.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delux-phoenix?select=9-u-8vM2cZKHwQYG00yZ4w#hcCouQJXFqiYIFikfy_eZQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/delu...</a>  Got to try a few other things as well such as the Brie and Mushroom Soup.  While it didn't have gooey strands of brie (man I was hoping for that) it was more like a very rich cream of mushroom soup.  Very good.  They have a different soup each day, so if you want this one you have to come on Thursdays.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delux-phoenix?select=9-u-8vM2cZKHwQYG00yZ4w#JZaNWjKY7Q8YgAWmUy62TQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/delu...</a>  I was so full it was hard to get dessert, but I'm so glad I did.  The apple pie was very homemade tasting, piping hot topped with Haagen Dazs Vanilla Ice Cream.  We loved every bite of it.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delux-phoenix?select=9-u-8vM2cZKHwQYG00yZ4w#MpH-7ioUSrGWUCqgxLo3TA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/delu...</a>  I wish I lived near Delux as I'd love to try some other things on their menu.  They now have a Sushi bar as well, but I have no idea how it is.  The vibe of the place is great and they have the kind of bathroom you wished you had in your house.  The attention to detail at Delux doesn't go unnoticed and it was great to see that they are still at the top of their game.  Another plus is they are open until 2am with a full bar!!",

All while other people around us were being served (mind you they sat down AFTER us) ... servers just kept on walking past us ...   We walked out and went to The Vig Uptown - they don't have the burgers Delux has, but hey - at least we got served.    We then decided to try Delux again this past weekend (8/11).  Same thing happened!  Sat on the patio, the owner even greeted us, other people sat down after us and were served and greeted before us.  We walked out and went to Zinburger at the Biltmore - they don't have the burgers Delux has, but hey - at least we got served ...",

If you love burgers, sushi and craft beer look no further. They're all perfect. What we love the most is being able to go for sushi and get fries on the side. Or go for a burger and also have a sushi roll. It's like a dream. A yummy burgery sushi beery fantasy. They do all of it exactly right. They have sushi happy hour. They stay open late which is a rarity in Phoenix. They have cocktails. There's plenty of parking. They do take out. They do lettuce wraps. The lighting is perfect. The service is fast and friendly. The prices are right. It's so good I'm getting a little choked up just thinking about the meal I had only yesterday. Tito, get me some tissue. Jermaine stop teasing.",

He made sure we had a great experience..something that is hard to find these days.  He truly has a passion for this restaurant.    The beef on his burgers comes from a small farm in northern Cali and is free of all the crap that comes from factory beef... and it tastes amazing!! The sweet potato fries and regular fries are very tasty too.  We also got the Kale chop salad, which was also amazing.  The atmosphere is very cozy here too, not loud, not too upscale, not to busy...just perfect.  I love all the booths too.  We will be coming back!",

The food is incredible the prices are great and the staff is awesome. I'm not a sushi guy so I usually get the hot dog on the pretzel bun and it's awesome. The fresh baked cookies and the real Coco chocolate cake are absolutely delicious. The french fries served in the little shopping carts are awesome as well. 5/5 definitely a cool place to bring people visiting Phoenix or a group of friends.",

Rehab Burger and Zinburger both have better burgers, and you'd get fries for the same price that Delux offers burger only at. We also tried the sushi, which was good but again nothing that you can't get elsewhere for the same price.",

The burger was undercooked (which was explained to us after we complained about the food temp of all of our meals).  Suggestion to management; instruct wait staff (who in our case was new & not very knowledgeable about menu/bar options, but I don't blame her, except other wait staff not much more knowledgeable) to advise customer of lower cooking rating before customer orders (& before you serve people undercooked beef bacteria!).  Really, if this place was good to great (not sure if back in the late 90's?), then clearly it has been managed into a really second rate burger joint not worth passing a fast food burger restaurant.  Another suggestion to management, maybe take a day & go have a beer and a burger at your competitors like for example Yard House where that many beer handles is worthy a menu that describes your beer ABV & IBU Characteristics with actual bartenders who know their pours!   Until you do figure this out, trust me, your competitors will love your repeat customers!",

Delux is often raved as the best place to get a cheeseburger and I can't say they are wrong. Ever heard of Zen 32? Well they moved into Delux and the same sushi can be had here.  They have a large beer selection of at least 40 beer taps. They also have a large cocktail menu and wine menu. The happy hour is generous and lasts from 3pm-7pm.  I purchased the double mini burgers and there was nothing mini about their flavor... DELICIOUS. My girlfriend got the low carb sushi and she said it might be the best sushi in Phoenix, and she is HARAH, when it comes to judging sushi.   We got the Sally cake for dessert and boy was it a great choice. I came for the chocolate but I left talking about the icing. So good and I highly recommend!  Last but not least, the experience is probably the best part about this place. The owner walks around the restaurant and greets everyone and you can tell he loves the restaurant he has built. He is a phenomenal guy and loves to talk to the customers so don't be afraid to say hello.  All in all, a well deserved 5 star review!",

Despite the delicious toppings on the delux it really didn't have any flavor. I would rather have a burger full of hormones and chemicals that tastes great!  Be aware that the delux burger is served on a baguette instead of a hamburger bun, some might find this to be a turn off.  Sushi is also available here and it's pretty good. Yes, this is also a sushi restaurant! It's sort of split sushi side/burger side but you can order either or both wherever you are seated.   They have great cocktails, even martinis. French fries are very good and they serve a large portion.   You can't beat the late night hours at Delux! They are open and serve food until 2:00AM.

    "text": "I had been here once before and had a burger with a fun fry \"grocery cart\" and a beer, which was good, but when one of my attendings brought us back here for sushi, I was incredibly impressed.  Who knew that a burger joint would also have the best sushi in Phoenix?  We chose several of the happy hour rolls, keeping the selections simple (for example, salmon rolls and spicy tuna, without the usual fancy additives).  The rolls contain a large amount of fish and very little rice, really highlighting the flavor of the buttery fish.  Delicious.  We also had some sashimi which was spectacular.  Even better - if you ask for it, the chef will chop up some REAL wasabi.  I didn't even know that the wasabi I ate at other restaurants wasn't real wasabi, but apparently real wasabi looks like a green salsa and has an incredible taste.  Way worth the extra $2.  Try some warm saki while you're at it!  We're excited to bring back friends to what is apparently one of the only places in Phoenix where you can get True unadulterated wasabi without the horseradish.",

It's not too big so they keep it original with the modern decor and the music they played during dinner this past Saturday night was ON POINT!  The food is ALWAYS spot on. I don't care if you order a burger or sushi- they know what they are doing!! It's fresh, delish, and I've never had to send anything back for any reason at all. The service??? GENUINE & AWESOME!! Laid back vibes but on their grind! The servers take their jobs seriously but also know how to have a nice convo with their regulars, it's refreshing!!   I love the fact that they are open late. It's a super classy spot to have a burger or sushi on a date night or chill night... That kind of versatility makes this place a gem!! Keep it up!!!",

Then I felt something and realized the vent was dripping on me. I couldn't get away from it; wherever I moved, it splashed me. The food was decent, certainly not bad, but more like a slightly higher priced version of foods that did not elevate beyond other versions that cost less. I work with Niman Ranch products and the sliders were left relatively flavorless as they were overcooked. Also, the sushi was very good, but relatively overpriced as it costs more than a lot of places while being smaller and lacking in presentation. It's not bad, not crazy overpriced, and the service is personable, but slow. Very average experience in a nice environment. The environment would add a half star if I could.",

Even gives us a to go of carrot & beet spiral swirls for our guinea pig. The owner, Lenny, is here in the evenings often and makes a point of making sure your meal & experience is great. Personalized attention & delicious food=must go!  Found another fun & wonderful server in Vanessa. Food amazing as always. Best burger in town!",

It is better than some places that advertise themselves as a beer bar.   Bathrooms are not unisex, but normally clean.   Food is pretty good. It's nothing amazing, but a solid burger and sushi roll.  And good happy hour prices if you can come during that time.   If they are broadcasting a game over the speakers and also have it on at the bar, there is a 3-5 second delay between the broadcasts, which isn't pleasant to listen to.   Some bartenders are more attentive than others.  Sometimes my glass is never empty (water or alcohol) and sometimes I have to sit there for a while and flag the bartender down to get more water.",

He definitely did better as a server than our last few, but that doesn't say too much. He was very patient and attentive for the most part. We ordered 4 burgers a basket of mixed fries and a sushi roll. The sushi roll we ordered was terrible, I had to send it back. Definitely not worth the $16 or so they charge you for it. I can't remember what it's called but, it has a bunch of shrimp in ther, and topped with I believe a spicy mayo?  I've worked at alot of sushi places throughout my life and the size and the amount of shrimp they only give you, definitely isn't worth the money, and pretty bland even dipped in soy sauce with wasabi.  So all in all my experience was good, better service this time.  Burgers are always a 4 star. Sushi is a 1 star. Starting to think we should probably just order burgers to go.",

Also the Vegas rolls seem undercooked and I'm not sure how she knows this taste but my sister claims the Vegas rolls tasted like bandaids, I know gross she's tasted bandaids but even more gross she had to relive tasting them by eating those rolls.

Ordered a turkey burger, added cheese and mushrooms ($3.50 extra seriously?!?) and got a half order of fries (mixed)  Fries were better plain as sauce was pretty bland.  Burger came with a side of some pico de gallo that had zero taste to it as well as a garlic aioli that a little flavor but nothing to really write home about.

    "text": "I have little else to say about Deluxe, other than it was there that I witnessed the unfortunate result of an unfortunate trend. Low-sodium \"soy\" sauce got itself added to the table at Japanese restaurants over a decade ago. Like a virus, its process of proliferation led to its overstepping its boundaries. Four years ago, I began having to ask the server to bring the real-er soy sauce to the table, as it became standard practice to bring that green-lidded, watered-down, bitter-tasting, sodium benzoate-laden gorp that people thought would act as the sole prophylactic against future kidney troubles, high blood pressure, and heart problems. My dinner at Deluxe exposed me to the culinary downfall of Western Civilization. The standard procedure, of the server bringing over that swill, happened like clockwork.  - \"Will you bring a bottle of regular soy sauce?\"  - \"We don't carry regular soy sauce. The low-sodium is the only kind we have.\"  To the server and among my friends, \"(chuckling) I never thought I'd see the day...\"  What to do...I had to think fast...  - \"What if I had a gluten allergy?...Do you have gluten free soy sauce?\"  - \"Yes we do.\"  BOOM! Checkmate, Sir. See, like the company informing you that Twizzlers, a product composed almost entirely of sugar, is fat free, I can order gluten free soy sauce and get as close to the real thing as possible. Companies like to save money by cutting their soy sauces with wheat, a practice they may have picked up by watching crafty drug dealers. Those with celiac disease cannot have wheat-derived products, so gluten free soy sauce is typically made purely from soy beans. Kikkoman still looked to money-saving strategies and cut their version with rice, but I was still happier than being forced to dip my maki roll with the fake crab in it into a fake soy sauce.",

And can I just say, \"Holy hell there were a lot of menus that got dropped down on our little two top of a table\" lol.   I tried their Samba roll; it was alright, nothing to write home about. The Vegas room was okay - it was a standard Vegas roll. The fries, the one thing I remember being awesome at the place was alright. Maybe I built it up in my mind and it didn't live up to the hype or perhaps it really wasn't super awesome as I once thought it was. The lobster bisque was good. Didn't have that finish that Wild Fish had, but it was still pretty good. I really appreciate that they have local brews available cause who doesn't love Papago's Orange blossom?   Now onto dessert - had a sample of their some pie and their peanut butter cookie which was chewy but not like undercooked or anything. It was a good finish rather than a full dessert. Topped with ice cream was just extra yummy. The apple pie was okay, but you really need the ice cream to combat the top of the pie. The crust under the filling, which has all the yummy flavorful goodness is better and not so dry. Both desserts are a good size and perfectly capable of being split between two people.  I'd come here again and give the sushi more of a chance cause I do love the burgers here.",

I enjoyed the lunch special of a $12 delux burger with fries - so ridiculously good!  The staff was beyond welcoming and truly makes me want to go back again quickly since they truly appreciate your business.  Nice atmosphere, amazing food and amazing service - what's not to like?",

Would rather get this combo at In N Out and save 10 dollars.",

Just get it as-is, medium rare. Then get yourself a shopping cart of sweet potato fries and dip them in the fry sauce. Do it! You won't regret it.   What else? The beer selection is amazing. And the service...the service. I can't even describe how friendly and accommodating they were today at lunch. I put my white cloth napkin across my black pants and the waitress asked if I would prefer a black napkin instead so I could match. What? That's insane attention to detail.   I've been going for 10 years. I took my wife-to-be there on one of our first dates. I take clients there. I had my bachelor party meet there for dinner before we hit the nudie bar. It's versatile like that. I'll always come back.",

After a few minutes I'm told they have to purchase root beer next door. After 15 minutes our food comes out, waitress still busy shopping for root beer next door at Safeway. They usually have root beer on draught; something that sort of justifies $8 for the float. Another 10 minuets go by and we've just about finished our food and a root beer over ice in a cup comes to the table. I tell the server I ordered a root beer float and she apologizes and has it made. Ready to pay my bill, and holding a fresh can of \"A&W from Safeway\"$8.00 root beer float would have been ok if the burger was good, which it wasn't. The burger was ok at best And to top it all off I was charged for a root beer and a root beer float. Worst experience I've had going out to eat in a very long time.",

You wouldn't expect to find amazing burgers and amazing sushi in the same place, but they manage to do it every time! The fries are great too and come in a cute little shopping cart :) I loveee the fact that they're open until 2AM because it helps when I'm out with friends and we are hungry but most places are closed.   The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the food can sometimes take a while to come out, but hey for the food you're getting, I don't mind waiting a little while! :)  I will continue to recommend Delux to anyone in the area looking for good food!!",

We know it was a burger place but had heard it had good sushi also, so we decided to give it a shot.  This was an excellent idea.    We got there and were seated in the sushi side as that was what we were craving.  Tara was our server and she was awesome.  She made some great recommendations based on what we liked.  We ordered a few rolls and had a couple of drinks.  Here is some info on the rolls we shared:  Lollipop roll - good, light, looks like a lollipop  Samba - excellent and tasty, little bit of heat on the back end - teriyaki-ish  Vegas roll - very good, lightly fried but great flavor  Overall, it was a great experience and we will definitely be back next time we are in the area.",

    "text": "As a professional musician, I'm used to hunting for places to eat after 1am, which in the early-to-bed, early-to-rise culture of Phoenix is not easy unless you're willing to settle for the typical Denny's or IHOP.   Delux is a go-to spot when I can get there before they close at 2am.  And, unlike virtually any other establishment open at that time, it's not a compromise or last resort.   Food: Everything I've had--from soup to burgers, appetizers, etc. has been top notch and very delicious and properly prepared.  The burgers are obtained exclusively from one ranch and you can definitely tell the difference in quality.   Good selection of craft beers if you're into that.   Service: I've been here many times and always had excellent, friendly service.  I see some others' complaints here, but I've never personally received poor service.  The opposite is True--I've walked in more than once within minutes of closing, and not once has the staff acted in any way annoyed nor hurried me.  That is HUGE in my book.   On occasion the owner is there and he's very friendly and personable.   Atmosphere: It's trendy and upscale, but small.  I like sitting in a booth, and none exist here, but that's a relatively minor issue.  There is a nice patio out front which is comfortable for most of the year (they have lots of space heaters).    All in all, one of the best burgers in Phoenix along with other great fare.  And probably the best choice for late night dining.",

    "text": "Delux.  Since today was National Cheeseburger Day I thought it only right to go out and find a place where I can get a really good cheeseburger, and from all of the reviews, this sounded like the place. We started out with their take on Bruschetta for an appetizer, which while good, lacked a bit of flavor. The bread was a little too soft for my liking and they piled the mixture on so high that you had to lift your plate to your face just so it wouldn't fall all over the table when you took a bite. So for the main course, we obviously both got the classic cheeseburger and a half order of fries. The ingredients came on the side and the fries on a completely different plate. The array and design of the dishes and food looked wonderful. As we ate our cheeseburgers we both noticed that the burger had no flavor, like it hadn't been seasoned at all. Honestly, they could have just put some salt on it before the cooked it and it would have been perfect but it was lacking on that department. Other than that the burger and the ingredients (pickles,onion,tomatoes, and lettuce) were very fresh and tasty. The bun was the best part, cooked with perfection to a golden brown outside yet a perfect medium between crispy and soft. Very tasty! The fries came with this garlic Chipotle aoli sauce that was to die for! I was well satisfied with the meal. For dessert, we ordered the Classic Root beer float made with two scoops of Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream- and you can't really mess up a root beer float, so that was a perfect ender to an overall, pretty good lunch.  And to comment on the service, it was great. She came only a couple times when she needed to and not any more so we can enjoy our lunch. I give this jazzy joint a 4 out of 5 stars. And recommend you try it out for yourselves!",

I ordered the cool Fresh Panini with fresh mozzerella cheese, fragrant basil and ripe tomatoes.  MMM, so good, dipped into a mix of balsamic and olive oil.  Morgan shared her burger with me, grassfed beef, and very juicy and delicious... I think it was topped with gorganzola?  So clean tasting... on very good brioche buns.  We also ordered a milk shake \"that's a pretty fuckin good milk shake!\"... chocolate goodness!  And dont forget the fries... we all shared baskets of regular idaho and sweet potato fries, served with ketchup and a mayo type sauce... WHAT THE HELL?  I dont like sweet potatoes or mayo, but why the hell couldn't I stop eating them!!!  Crazy good...  We HAVE TO GO BACK in the evening and try some beers, they have a ton on tap.  I don't like beer, but I do want to TRY if its from this place :o)  OH, one more thing, we sat at the bar and our server was awesome, Amanda was her name I believe.

The atmosphere is nice and modern, the window to the kitchen and open kitchen is a nice touch, the shiny squeaky clean  kitchen makes you feel warm and fuzzy about your food.   Again the hype. Like many places I have tried the hype kills it. I expected this burger to a burger fit for the gods. One that is so great that one has to fast for days to able to mentally and spiritually prepare for the extraordinary flavor.  It was a good a burger, just not the best. It is what one would imagine for a gourmet burger. Fancy bread, fancy greens and fancy stuff on the plate that no one eats. The sweet potatoes fries are good but nothing special about them, I mean they sprinkle some chopped parsley on it.   All in all it is a nice place, the food fits the atmosphere and area.

Soooo good. The restaurant is pretty small and has a unique vibe to it. They serve a huge selection of beers. No complaints with the service.  I wouldn't suggest taking a larger party here, as it is so small and takes a long time to sit.  Depending on when you go, you can face a pretty long wait.",

You might get the same result at home, but only if you have time to grind your own beef and grow your own arugula.   I tried the Papago Orange Blossom beer...not bad, but soft; it was a bit too similar to what the eight year olds are selling at the lemonade stand down the street from my house.  Finally, the restrooms were clean and candle-lit. It's the kind of restroom you'd see in one of those late-night, Showtime movies.   I'll go back to Delux in a month or two, but I'll probably order from the to-go menu rather than pulling up a stool.",

This makes eating at Delux a little unusual but pleasently enough, not impossible.  I went with my friend (early, because I have seen how busy it gets when I hit up Zen 32).  The decor was super cute (which I find important) and I love that french fries come in a shopping cart.    Anyway, I went because my friend had a major hankering for some of the cupcakes.  I got the turkey burger (because of the no red meat thing) and it was pretty fantastic.  I took off the tomato (I hate them), but they had a cute sign that told the customers why theirs were still safe.  My friend had a burger (of some sort...I didn't pay too much attention...sorry) and she really enjoyed it (although she asked for medium and it was probably medium rare...she couldn't eat the middle).  I am telling you that it is good.  I want to go back for sure.  Oh yeah, one last thing, the burgers are huge!  I couldn't finish mine...but I really did want to...",

It's my favorite burger spot.   The atmosphere is slightly on the pretentious side. However, it's very small and pretty cramped. Even at lunch during the week it can feel cramped at a table and there's a big chance of waiting in line awhile. I've sat both inside and outside and felt a little too close to the other tables. It's a little complicated with bigger groups also.  The food however is amazing. I always get the same thing, a delux burger and sweet potato fries. I don't care if you are scared of medium rare, you need to try this thing. It's one of the most amazing burger's I've had and I can never finish the entire thing. I'd love to have a mini one. That would be perfect. A regular order of fries comes in an adorable metal mini shopping cart. Also good to note is that by default you do not get just ketchup with your fries. Being a non tomato eater, it's nice to not have to remember to ask for another dipping sauce.   Oh the beer list you ask? Phenomenal. Being able to order a red velvet always makes me happy. Unique beer flights make me happy also.   I never have room for dessert while I'm there but I did have a friend order the cookies they brag about one time. It was rather hard and I wasn't impressed. That cookie should have been soft and chewy and full of deliciousness.  It's a bit on the pricey side, and you typically are going to have to wait awhile and/or be cramped, but if you're not in a hurry, it's worth checking out.",

    "text": "A la carte fries in a SHOPPING CART = love. Sweet potato fries in a shopping cart = I have to check that I still have a pulse.  I wish wish WISH that there was a Delux in Chicago. The burger (rare, just how I like it) was nothing short of incredible, and I am ridiculously enamored of the mayo aioli for dipping the shopping cart sweet potato fries.   The beer/cocktail menu here is more extensive than you'd ever expect for a burger joint. It takes up several pages of the menu - which, by the way, is pretty nifty looking. The beer flights come in cute little trays, which may be entirely unnecessary, but they're fabulous nonetheless.  If I hadn't been so full from the burger, I would have had one of the gorgeous cupcakes from Delux's to-go place next door. Or a mini-apple pie. Or both.",

    "text": "Supposedly Delux is the only place that sells lobster bisque in all of the Valley.  After a week of craving lobster bisque, a friend of mine told me that Delux sells this soup.  I've been meaning to go to Delux for awhile.  I hear their burgers are the best in the Valley. I got crap on twitter because my friends knew I was going to Delux, but getting the soup instead of a burger.  C'est la vie...last week, my cravings were to strong and I had to give in.  Burgers will have to wait.  I went to Delux 2 Go specifically for the soup.  I decided to surprise my boyfriend with lunch and ordered him one too.  Delux sells soups daily.  They make lobster bisque on Wednesdays. A schedule of their soups is on their menu which can be found on their website.  I also ordered the tomato mozzarella salad.  I can never pass up a caprese salad.  While I waited for my order they offered me a water or iced tea.  I thought that was really nice.  The soups hit the spot.  The salad not so much.  The tomatoes and cheese were fresh.  I had problems with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Both came in their own containers.  I tried mixing them without success.  I tried dipping it.  Not luck there either.  It was very diappointing.  All in all, I will be back.  Just to try the burger and for a bowl of lobster bisque.  I loved the soup",

First off, it's pricey, the sushi was below average, and the burgers and chicken salad were average. Lastly, my rating doesn't take into account that we found a hair in our fries which the manager comped and apologized for. Atmosphere was dull, more like a diner with no ambiance. Overall not one of the four of us in our party said we would go back.",

    "text": "Barney's this place is not. If you've become accustomed to the creative variety of burgers at that small Bay Area chain, Delux will be somewhat of a disappointment. Like others have mentioned, this place is loud, busy and pricey, but still manages to produce a decent dinner experience.\r \r A recent 6:30 Friday evening visit had our party of four waiting for only about 10 minutes before we were seated at the long, narrow community table in the center of the restaurant. Not a bad wait, I'd say. The service was efficient, but friends she certainly did not want to make. Nevertheless, we ordered drinks, fries and burgers and tried to pass the time by talking above, through and around the noise. We were fairly unsuccessful. My qualm came with the bill.\r \r The Standard burger is a whopping $9 and the separate basket of fries is an additional $5. That means a burger and split order of fries rings up at a very San Francisco-like $11.50. Yikes! A joint in a strip mall in Phoenix leaves a bit to be desired when contemplating an $11.50 burger. For about the same price, a diner can get a trip to Chelsea's Kitchen up the road. Both have good burgers and Sierra Nevada. One just does it a little better than the other.",

Everyone was chatting and having a grand time. Then my two year old pushed aside the french fry cart and smeared her hand through the ketchup dish and on to my shirt. Yup - gone are those free evenings to sit around and savor time out with friends and loved ones!   This place was nice. The seating outdoors looked a little more spacious however with a record high of 111 today it did not sound appealing. The inside seating was tight.   The wait staff was friendly. I ordered a burger served medium. It came out medium rare. It was tasty and the bun was delicious. My hubby ordered the grilled cheese panini. It was made with three different cheeses and arugula. It was very good. The sweet potato french fries were well seasoned and I loved the aioli dipping sauce.   I would warn if you do have young children - this probably is not the best place to take them. Delux does have carry out. Next time we go perhaps it will be for \"date\" night. :)",

Not to mention that everything on the menu here comes out to less money than the god awful Fudrucker's that so many cardboard people in Phoenix adore.  I wont even go into my dreaded $13 lunch experience there.  EW!  An amazing burger for 9 bucks.  A shared basket of fries for 5.  10 or 12 beers at 4.75 each?  This is a dream come True.  If you don't look out the window you can even forget you are in a parking lot.  This place is even open late so after a night of bar hopping and parking lot traversing you can still pop in here and get a burger and beer in appealing surroundings.  LOVE IT!",

Then...I tried the Delux Burger.  Wow.  I'm talkin', \"Holy Shit Wow!\"  It's that good.  (Ok, so I used that expression in a previous review, but it applies here as well)   The meat is so fresh and so good.  The bun is great. The baby arugla is a nice touch, making it stand out from all other burgers.  Here's how the menu describes their burger...  \"fresh ground, all natural, grain fed certified premium beef, maytag bleu cheese and gruyere cheese blend, caramelized onion with applewood smoked bacon mixture and baby arugula served on a hand crafted toasted demi-baguette. [lettuce wrap available]\"  They recommend the burger prepared medium-rare and I agree.  Gotta try the fries with the aioli sauce.  I suggest dipping the burger in the aioli too!  I am starting to crave one now just writing this.",

Inside the restaurant,  the staff appeared very attentive to the guests.  Atmosphere: From the outside, it looks like a very cool place to eat with the neon blue lights. The patio was spacious and inside was on the dark side.   Food Quality: Here's where the ball was dropped. The burger was definitely on the greasy side as evidence by the accumulation of grease on the bottom of the takeout container. Interestingly, the beef patty was on the dry side. Despite this, I think I would return and try the Classic Burger, which is on a brioche bun (looks great). The fries were too thin (personal preference), but tasted great.  Overall Experience: The atmosphere definitely shined more than the Delux Burger, but will return to give it another try.",

I look on Yelp on what's opened now because it's 11pm on a Sunday and this place comes up. So we said why not it has a lot of reviews and 4 stars is good for all those reviews. We get there around 11:45 and it was seven of us so when the guy asked us how many he knew it was a struggle because at nearly 12am this place was packed on a Sunday. He told us only outside is available for our party of seven which is fine they provide heaters so no ones really cold. We order Sake bombs and sushi and burgers and honestly for what I had on my own was good. The tiger and Vegas rolls were good. The tiger roll is more on the spicy side and a Vegas roll everyone should know what that is if you eat sushi. But they did lack on service they slacked on coming back. But for a party of seven shouldn't you give us more attention than a party of 2? The waitress was cool when we threw some drunk jokes out there she started to laugh and comment back. Also outside its impossible to see your menus you have to grab the candle or the flashlight on your phone. It's got a nice feeling it to it tho. I like the place the foods good they just need to work on service especially being such a busy place. Also very small and bathrooms are cool haha.",

    "text": "This is really a high quality burger place.  If you want a greasy spoon burger joint (which sometimes I grave) this is not the place.    This is more burgers the way Elements Restaurant would serve them.  What's great about this place is that it also serves high quality healthy food (beet salads, insalata caprese, sushi, etc.)  So for you guys who have healthy eating wives, like mine, go her with equanimity. You stuff your expanding gut and she can remain gorgeous and slender.   Ok, the fries were wonderful and not greasy but a tad too healthy for my redneck taste.  The burgers are of the highest quality.  You can see it and smell it even before you take one bite.  I love the way they cut up just the right amount of lettuce for you.  The pickles are sliced perfectly.  The meat is cooked just the way you order it.  etc etc.  My only complain--which is purely individual--is that I would rather a soft bun than a brioche bun.  I'm getting tired of burgers and sandwiches served on brioche.  I know it's french and chic but it's also too thick and destroys that elusive balance between bread and meat that makes a burger a burger--take a lesson from In 'n Out.  Our waitress was delightful and this place from the manager to the illegal alien serving the water go out of their way to make you feel welcome and appreciated.  My only counsel would be to the manager to stop by a patron's table once.  After three times, it starts to become interruptive--especially when I'm in the midst of gnawing on your delicious burger.  Chapeau to all those who work hard to make this place great and it is great.",

    "text": "Interesting concept for a burger joint.  I was expecting to wait to eat at such a trendy-looking restaurant, but we were seated immediately at our choice of patio or inside.  We opted for the patio.   The waiter seemed distracted and didn't know much about the expansive beer list.  If you pride yourself on beer (Delux has over 40), you best know your shit. We ordered a beer flight, with our choice of three--this satiated my indecisiveness when it comes to ordering...  The menu was limited.  I was expecting many more creative burgers than the five or six listed (only two of which were actual beef burgers).  I guess if you do the burger right, you don't need many to choose from.    My dining companion and I split the chopped Asian salad and the turkey burger.  The salad was very tasty and was enough for two large helpings for each of us (and then some).  I'm always hesitant to order a turkey burger for fear of crumbly, dry meat.  We took a chance and it came out moist and flavorful.  The burger arrived cut into halves, which made divvying it up easy.  Plus, it came with non-fat cilantro aioli and pico de gallo (I love my sauces!).  We were happy campers.    The setup of the patio is awkward. There is no flow whatsoever.  Our waiter slammed an opposing chair into my knee, and I felt like I had to crawl over people sitting at surrounding tables just to get to the bathroom.  Also interesting was the communal sink outside of the restrooms.  It's a restaurant...not a club.   I'm curious to try other items.  I'll be back, but it's not the first thing on my list.",

The waitress did not notice my disdain.   Meal two: Seriously the worst grilled cheese Panini I ever had. The sweet potato fries were okay but didn't hold a candle to Fez fries.   I do like purse hooks at the bar.   I remember a time when Delux served delicious food that was well prepared and um..actually tasted good.

    "text": "Delux has been my go-to Burger place (other than In-n-Out of course) during my time in Arizona. Delux is open until 2AM.... 2AM!! Open until 2AM on sundays is unheard of! Given that I'm a night owl, Andrew and Delux are a match made in heaven.   The owner of Delux also owns the Zen 32 sushi bar and Revo Burrito, which all happen to be in the same shopping center. He controls 4 store fronts (also Delux To Go), which makes a pretty impressive representation in such a small area.  Delux offers indoor and outside seating, but like other yelpers mentioned, if you come with a party with more than 4, be prepared to wait. Most tables only sit 4, and will have to be moved together. There is a long community table in the center of the restaurant, which is a nice change for Phoenix... I say this because Phoenix seems like a place where people in restaurants pretend they're eating in their homes... and it's a social faux pas to talk to your neighbor.   Now for the food. The burgers are delicious. I personally recommend the delux burger. This comes with a cheese blend (which I always ask for no cheese, so I can't review it), bacon, sauteed onions, and arugula. I get this medium and with added tomato and pickles. Ask for a side of the aioli and ketchup to smear this on your bun, you'll thank me later.  As a compliment to your meal, order the sweet potato fries. The french fries are pretty standard, but the sweet potato fries are excellent. They come in a mini metal grocery shopping cart, which adds a nice touch. These are served with a side of the aioli and ketchup.  Delux has a very nice drink menu, with a large variety of beers and interesting drinks.   For the atmosphere, the restaurant is very hip, but far from hipster (which is good). You'll feel comfortable here dressed in either a jacket and jeans or even shorts and a t-shirt (you'll see both groups represented).  In summary, the food is excellent, the atmosphere is great, and the hours of unbeatable.",

    "text": "I experienced severe waiter envy, once again, at Delux.  I actually had not gone to Delux since I bit into a chicken last time I wrote this review. But it was late at night, I was craving Chimay on tap and sweet potato fries and I knew they had Youngs Double Chocolate Stout on tap too. Plus it wasn't too bad of a drive from Tempe.  We heard Blonde Redhead coming in, a nice sonic surprise, but from there service plummeted. The host didn't even get up and as we went to the bar to look at the beers, he deadpanned \"You guys are just sitting at the bar right\" and didn't even look up from the stand. Okkkaaayyyyy.  Sat down at a table and our waiter ...no, our dude who brought us food once in a while, lets call him Noah, said \"what do you guys want to drink\". Ok. So we gave him the orders, brought back delicious Chimay, then came back 1/2 way through the drink (btw, you dont drink Chimay fast) and said \"ready yet?\". We first got the basket of mixed, which we demolished and def. better than last time we were here. Tim ordered the traditional delux burger on whole wheat bun and asked if it could be cut in half (his mustache has odd handling needs) and Noah deadpanned \"it already is like that\". If he could have said DUH at the end, I wouldn't have been surprised.  As his burger was done halfway, he brought him the Youngs Double Chocolate Stout cause I was still working on my Chimay. Fair game. However, Tim was done with the burger and we sat there. And watched the other waiter be so much better than Noah. The other waiter smiled, asked how people liked fries, the OTHER waiter even took our empty plates and glasses for us it was sitting there for so long! I wanted other waiter. I waited for Noah. Finally, I GOT up and ordered my own beer (Dogfish Punkin Ale) from the bartender and ran my card with her instead of Noah getting that tip from me.   While I was at the bar, he came back to our table and asked if we wanted dessert or if I wanted another beer! A little late, Noah, don't you think? Tim still ordered a chocolate chip cookie, and Noah dropped it off with the plate and two forks. Ooo, was it warmed up and goo....no. We went to get our forks-bascially cold and crispy. Okay. So we did manage to fork it in half and eat it with our hands. At this point Noah swoops to Tim and says in a loud, weirdly hopeful voice \"Another beer?\" \"Uh, no just the check, thank you\".   The most Noah does is at the end is when he drops off the bill \"HAVE A GOOD NIGHT\". Every single quote from him is verbatim. No hello, hows it going, have you been here before, HOW IS ANYTHING, nothing. It really wasn't that busy and it took what could have been a laid back night of burgers and fries and delicious beer into a frustrated and annoyed night.  If I come here, in another year or two, I will sit at the bar like I should have done originally  and until I cannot resist the Chimay. But two horrible services like that in a row? That is bullshit.  I'll borrow a shopping cart from my own friendly neighborhood bum and fill it with my own goddamn Safeway frozen sweet potato fries while drinking Natty Ice, thank you.",

However, in my opinon Delux makes a huge mistake...since when was it cool to take away everyone's privacy?  I went here with a client, and was almost afraid to say anything confidential because the next patrons over were only about 6 inches from my face!  Ok, they weren't that close but it felt like it.  At one point the woman next to me actually chimed in on a comment I made to my client about the drink I was having!  I think it's arrogant for Delux to think their food is so good that everyone will gladly sit on each other's laps in order to wolf down a marginally creative burger.  The bottom line is that you shouldn't come here if you want one shred of privacy to talk with your companions.  If you're alone however, this might be the perfect place to make some friends!",

They tasted good and love the little shopping cart.  Our waiter was really nice and friendly.  That is about all I was really impressed with.  My first impression on walking in was \"it is very loud in here\". Then looking at the seating I was thinking it should be fun sitting elbow to elbow with everyone in here.  Seats are very close together.  Not much room to enjoy your dinner and have a conversation.  Now the food.  I guess I just was not impressed by the food.  I had the Delux burger and it wasn't bad but not worth the price.  The beef may be good quality but it was not the best burger I have ever had.  I would probably not even put it up on the top 50% of burgers I have had.  I feel like if you say you have amazing burgers, then you should at least live up to the expectation.  My opinion is the burger fell short.  Other things that were not up to par was that the AC was not working very well.  I will say the owner came around and appologized for that and I think that was nice of him.  A confusing part of the place is the whole sushi thing.  Are you a burger place or a sushi place?  From what I have heard neither are amazing so maybe focus on one and do it well.  Also while our waiter was very friendly I would not say the service was great by any standards.  Not sure if I will try it again... maybe a sandwich next time???",

It's reminiscent of a smaller La Grande Orange, in that it's basically a glorified deli, but with all the trimmings - sandwiches, salads, sushi, bakery, plus all the regular Delux items are available as well.   About the food - think pre-made yuppie roast beef sandwiches ($7) with balsamic infused roasted red peppers or, what I had, the turkey sandwich with dijon mayo spread and cranberry relish.   The sushi is readymade as are the side salads (including a deliciously tangy southwest pasta salad) and are in a refrigerated grocery-style section along with Pom, Kemper sodas and overpriced waters such as Ty Nant, Blu and Voss.  The desserts are a welcome addition, but I thought the cupcakes (strawberry and red velvet among them) were too small for the $3 they were charging.  You're better off hoofing it to Tammie Coe or Karsh's for that price.  The cookies looked more reasonable and delicious -- the cranberry white chocolate chip had cranberry icing shavings on the top.  Yum.  There are only five or so seats in the joint, so be prepared to take it to go - as the name of the place suggests.  I guess they're upfront about that, right?",

I am a huge fan of the \"Standard Classic Burger\" here.  It is fresh simplicity, at it's best.  A hot, greasy burger on a fresh bun and tons of good fixings.....I go back here again and again.  Pair this up with a \"grocery basket\" of mixed fries (regular & sweet potato), and you've got yourself a great meal.  I always order extra sides of their \"fresh aioli\" sauce, which ultimately finds itself all over my burger, as well as my fries.  A quick note on their signature \"delux burger\"....very good and I love that it's served on a demi-bagette, but the maytag and gruyere cheeses are just a bit much for me.  I'm not a big blue cheese guy, and I think it just overpowers the burger.  But, if strong cheese is your thing, order away....they don't call it the \"delux burger\" for nothing!  One last comment that you may not know about delux......they serve until 2:00 AM.  So, after a night of power drinking, divert your taxi to Camelback & 32nd Street for the ultimate anti-hangover gut bomb.  Expect to wait for a seat.  I've found the wait at 1:30 AM is as long, if not longer, than it is during lunch!",

The burger was cooked the way I asked for it, medium, and was quite flavorful and juicy.  The whole burger experience was just not as stellar as I had hoped.  I do love how they serve their fries in the shopping carts.  I had to resist the urge to steal them, but I did notice that they had them for sale.  The sweet potato fries are pretty good, but pale in comparison to the amazing sweet potato fries at FEZ.  The regular fries aren't bad either.  The presentation of the food here is quite nice, and I give them props for that.   I've been here a couple times, but I'm just less than impressed.  I probably won't be back because it isn't close enough to go often and it isn't good enough to bring me back.",

    "text": "Voted \"Best Burger,\" by the Phoenix Magazine, January 09 Dining Guide issue, Delux's Delux Burger was far from the best. The burger was nothing more than an under-seasoned and over-cooked beef patty confined in an oversized soggy baguette.   The burger is supposed to have been dressed with organic rocket, caramelized onions, applewood-smoked bacon and blue and gruyere cheeses. Should have had a lot of flavor, right? But it didn't. The only identifiable flavor was the sweetness of the caramelized onions.   Also, the roasted beet salad was overdressed and soggy. If it wasn't for the texture of the beets I wouldn't have known they were there.  The sweet and earthy flavor that I was hoping for was lost due to the overabundance of the salty blue cheese and sweet balsamic vinaigrette.   Delux does have a couple things going for them: a pretty cool ambience, an extensive drink menu, and they serve up a refreshingly cold glass of H2o.",

    "text": "Can you be a member of PHX yelp having NOT reviewed Delux?  This is like being jumped into Los Yelpes Gigantes.  Since Delux has been reviewed consistently for over two years, there is nothing that I can offer as a varied opinion, but i thought, what the hell?  I don't stop breathing air just cos everyone else has already done it.  Some things are necessary.  Delux is like your all-time favorite song.  Sure, you've had it over and over again, you know its intricacies, you've interpreted, and digested its offerings.  And then something happens that shocks you.  You get sick of it.  So, you stash it away, lose it on your memory's playback, and banish it from your favorite playlist.  Sometime later, it comes up again, and you think ... \"Oh yeahhhh!\"  This is Delux.    So you go back, get your usual pint of Anchor Steam, your maytag burger, and the halfer of sweet potato/boring potato fries.  Then you wonder why you ever shunned it.    This shit is great.  I won't ever dismiss it again.  Pretty soon, it will be a classic and you'll hear everyone talk stories about it, how they were there in 1972 when Delux opened for The Kinks.",

    "text": "FOOD: Arguably the best burger I've ever had. The sauce they have on it is what makes it. The bread is also good. The sweet potato fries are a must have! Get a pint of beer to wash it down, they have a good selection.   PRICE: Expensive by burger standards. A burger is about $9, drinks are around $6, fries around $3.   SERVICE: The wait can be painful, I once waited over an hour with some friends for a table. The dining area is simply too small for how many people want to eat at Delux. Luckily, they gave us a discount on our meal for waiting so long.   ATMOSPHERE: Really odd blend of stylish bar and a burger joint. It's funny to see people dress all up for a burger.   SKINNY: Come here on weekends with a group of friends for an excellent burger and good drinks. You will be back again.",
