    "text": "I was very disappointed with the service at this restaurant location. The place was very empty at the time--around 8:30 on a Sunday night. We stood waiting for the hostess to show up at the hostess stand for over 5 minutes... At first, we thought that they were closed! We were seated in a very strange location of the restaurant pushed off to the corner at a table that was far too small for our party of three (odd, since the restaurant was so empty). The worst service however came from our waiter, who was extremely slow! We waited at least 15 minutes for our drink orders, over 45 for our food, and our drinks were never refilled ONCE! My friend had to eventually find our waiter and ask him for our check when we were done eating. The food was alright but I don't think I'll be back at that location!",

    "text": "**Original review from 6/1/2011. Updating new profile.**  I first tried Gordon Biersch in San Diego and fell in love with the salmon caesar salad. Now I'm in Tempe and I have been to that location well over 10 times. I will go there for the salmon caesar, but will never stray from my usual order ever again. Unless it's just to pick up a quick order of garlic fries. Those are just yummy!  My friend who introduced me to the place has finally come up with what should be their slogan.... and after going through the latest experiences with them I might have to agree with her. \"Gordon Biersch. We'll just serve you what we want.\"  Let me explain based on my last dining excursion there. My last 3-4 have been about the same.  I arrive with my favorite carnivore who is also my best friend. We are seated promptly and receive our water with no wait. That's always good and they are good at doing this. She orders a burger as she has done for the last 3-4 times. She tells them she wants it medium. I told her she should have said rare because the last several times it came back well done. I strayed from my usual order of salmon caesar and ordered the crab cake sandwich. I asked her if she could substitute the lemon aioli for the tartar sauce, she said sure. I then asked if my garlic fries could be extra crispy and extra garlic and my friend said she didn't want hers that way. Waitress said no problem....  We get our orders. Burger? Well done again, not even close to medium. Fries for my friend? Extra crispy. Crab Sandwich? I had to ask her what the sauce was because it didn't look like the lemon aioli they serve with the appetizer and it didn't look like tartar sauce either. Her response? \"Oh that's our cajun sauce.\" WTH? No asking if I want it? Luckily, I was ok with it. My fries? I got my extra garlic, but they were a little soggy instead of extra crispy.  My friend and I were swapping fries.  We ordered dessert. Should have known better. They don't make their desserts there. That's apparent. The chocolate cake was really dry and their bread pudding was just disappointing (according to my friend). Thank heavens for the vanilla ice cream.... but I could pay much less at DQ.  I will continue to go there for the garlic fries because addicts need to get their fix too. I've learned not to stray from my usual order. Their salmon is never over salted, and always cooked perfectly.",

Zero apology.  My husband asked for a refill on water, she refilled his but did not refill mine which was more than half empty. His burger was cold and rare when he ordered medium well. Honestly this is the most horrible service, food, experience ever.",

Our server was very nice, but after just seating two tables on the patio, some other sever comes out and starts shutting down TVs.  Said he was getting prepped for closing. One table hadn't even ordered yet.  Had to ask them to turn them back on.  Here's a novel idea. Don't sit people on the patio if you want to shut it down...or turn tvs off after last guest is gone. Got two stars cuz our server did the right and took off the fries from our bill.",

They've changed the menu somewhat since my last visit (unless each restaurant gets to design its own, which I doubt).  The food is good and the service friendly.  This particular branch is on the second floor and has a little bit of a weird layout, but it's attractive and you can also eat outdoors on the balcony.  Of course, the beer is quite good, as it has been at every one of my experiences at these restaurants.",

    "text": "As much as I like beer and good service, of which both GB has plenty of; what I find myself lacking as a patron here is personality - even though I get the feeling that, this is by design and not by accident.   The Food.  You know what, I only had appetizers. I had most of the appetizers on the menu, and nothing had a wow factor. It just wasn't there. Maybe I should come back at another time, but then again for the price I just expect more adventure than a carefully designed meal that doesn't stick out in its defense to please the masses.   The Beer.  Yes I had the Beers. Several from the whole spectrum, and if I had to recommend a malty beverage I'd say I would recommend the Marzenbier (or they call it Marzen). Its color is darker than its taste, but I found it very pleasurable. In fact I think all the beers are worth a sample in this place.   The Service.  I'd say that the service is extremely professional. From the greeter, to the personable waiter/waitress couple that served our party. I CAN believe that the service will depend on the party, and if you look like you are not fitting the desired clientele, you might receive a lesser service. With that said, service for me was great.   The Overall.  For a business casual lunch/dinner meeting, I think this place is THE place. Especially if the client you are trying to grease is a beer drinker (even if they have other very tasty drinks). But for the average guy (me) it is the kind of establishment franchise I am actively trying to avoid. It's too bland for me, and the price for stated blandness is too high. If I only consider service then I would be all for it, but I am a foodie so I can't stand behind that.",

The location is quite honestly one of the best parts--you're on Mill and 5th and the patio (2nd story) faces the east, southeast, and direct south. You have to go up a flight or two of stairs before you actually enter the restaurant, but once you're almost all the way up, you'll find the bar and open seating to your right and the rest of the dining room to the left. Great views of Tempe, Mill, West 6th, and the distant mountains.  I've had the pleasure of meeting the brewmaster of this Gordon Biersch and he runs a very precise and sanitary operation with the little room he has. The brewery that you can see behind the bar is pretty much it--there aren't any other tanks other than those. Even so, the taps are always flowing.  Food here is good but it is pretty expensive if you're not coming during happy hour. Due to the price, I usually just grab a beer or two with a side of garlic fries. They have the BEST garlic fries on the street. Very satisfying stuff.  I would recommend Gordon Biersch as a lunch or dinner spot, but there are much better places on Mill for late night adventuring.",

It's very good, but it's not a favorite.  The salads are really the best thing on the menu.  Everything else is just mediocre.  Once again, besides the beer.  I do love the view and the location.

    "text": "My BF and I were in town for the Insight Bowl, won by ISU!!!  We were searching the Mill Ave seen, near the ASU campus and decided to try GB.  We've gone by the one in SD, but never tried it, so this was a good chance.  The beer was fantastic!!  Neither one of us is a big beer drinker, so we tried the Golden Export, there mildest brew!  It was easy to drink and the flavor of the hops came out.  We were told they could be bought in bottles at Bev Mo...TBD.  As for dinner, I had the Jambalaya with orza pasta and my BF had the Flat Iron steak.  The jambalaya was good, the sausage was tasty, tho the chicken and shrimp weren't.  It was hard to see since the lighting was dim.  I definitely think this dish would have been better with rice!  My BF didn't finish his rice and gave some to me to mix it in with mine and it gave it much more texture, the the pasta.   His steak was cooked right (well for him!) and fairly tender tho there were some tough sectiions.  We will try the one in SD for sure, maybe just for the beer and happy hour!",

It doesn't have any personal charm like say Four Peaks has.  The food is good albeit overpriced.  One of the best things is being able to sit out on the patio and people watch on Mill Ave.",

    "text": "The only thing cool about GB in Tempe is the old building it resides in. It has character and distinction in a sea of cookie cutter architecture. The food is decent and the beer is ok. I have been to 4 different GBs , 3 in Northern Cali and 1 in AZ, and they are equally mediocre  in quality. I guess chains really take the coolness out of places. I watched this show last night on McDonald's, as it highlighted the top 10 Mikey D's in the world, based on uniqueness. It ranged from Times Squares 4 story MD with a Broadway Marquee of lights facing 42nd street, to an MD designed like a huge Happy Meal in Dallas Texas.  The chain rule applies to GB and MD, cool exterior doesn't change the fact you still serve processed chain food.   Anyway, the highlight of my GB experience was when I went accidentally to the actual brewery in San Jose. I Google Map GB in the attempts to find one close to my hotel, low and behold, I showed up and it was the freakin' brewery! It smelled great, like roasted hops and barely, but it was closed so I couldn't get in. I all of  sudden felt like singing the Lavern and Shirley Theme Song as I walked in the parking lot looking for an open door.........Schlemiel, schlimazel, hasenpfeffer incorporated! I too felt like I worked at a brewery, just for one shining moment.",

I felt like an asshole because I sent my steak back a couple times, I ordered it medium and it was well done, but the manager and waitress was awesome about it. The steak finally came just right and was perfectly seasoned! The broccoli has so much sexy delicious butter on it! Don't bother with the wings, they're overcooked and there's not much meat on them. I actually wouldn't get alcohol here either, not a good beer selection and the drinks aren't made well and are in small glasses filled mostly with ice.  Though it's not a steakhouse I was impressed with the steak and I know not to come some where that doesn't specialize in steak expecting them to make it right. The service saved them! The manager was a nice guy with a sense of humor and our waitress was a sweetheart. My friend had a pasta dish that they gladly made vegetarian friendly for him. They went above and beyond for us and I appreciate their efforts.",

We definitely enjoyed people watching from the upstairs patio on Mill.  The beer was good. Between us we tried the Pilsner, Marzen and Maibock. The latter two hit the spot for me, even if the Maibock was a bit sweet. It was exactly what I needed then. What I loved was the 21oz servings of the beer and since we went on Tuesday at happy hour, each set us just $2.50! I gotta say, this alone will be bringing us beer drinkers back for more and we'll definitely be trying the food next time! There was a regular running group meeting there as well so I am looking forward to checking that out.",

Love the wide open patio space and the huge windows.... you kind of feel outside even if you aren't, which rocks. Tons of natural light.  My girlfriend and I sat down at a bar table and perused the large, large menu. With soooooo many beers and plenty of cocktails, I was super surprised to hear that they didn't carry any ciders at all. What!? Sad... but I ordered a Bloody Mary instead and it was pretty darn good. Nothing super special, but no complaints. I drank it all!  Of course you'll find any kind of appetizer you want here. For real. Nachos, egg rolls, bruschetta, crab cakes, ahi, chips, fries, dips, wings, sliders..... the entrees are just as varied. I wanted to order the tacos which sounded fab, but they only have flour tortillas and no corn substitute. Bummer. It's cool, our waitress knew exactly what was and wasn't GF on the menu. I opted for the Garlic Fries which weren't fantastic, but were indeed covered in plenty of fresh garlic and you can never go wrong there. Yay for horrific breath!  I'd return to Gordon Biersch because it's casual, comfortable, and familiar. Something for everyone, decent prices, and quick friendly service. Nothing too unique or interesting, but a fun time all the same.",

    "text": "What can I say about this place?  Well, it's centrally located, it's a bit pricey and they have one good beer on tap.  I was really into GB before their old brewer left them and used to roll there between classes for college fuel... They had a killin beer called the Dunkles, but it's existence is no more at the Tempe Location.  I like the Marzen quite a bit as well.  The food is good, but I believe it's priced about $3 more than it's worth, and for brewing their own beer, they charge more than any other bar on mill.  This is unacceptable since: A. Their beer is just good... not 4 peaks mouth watering. B. They only have 4 beers on tap. C. They brew it, and anyone who's worked at a brewery knows that beer costs in the range of $.25-$.75 a pint to make.  This place is also inconsistent.  I don't know how many times I've sent back my garlic fries appetizer because they were cold, soggy and undercooked.  Many times, they threw the same fries back into the fryer and brought them back overcooked.  I have had many a free meal due to reasons like this or server incompetence.   I have also run into a few bartenders there that have bad attitudes, and I do believe that the staff their has a pole shoved up their collective asses... except for the dude that served me yesterday. He was cool and an artist, but this is an exception and not a rule.  I really want this place to be more, but it's a corporate eatery that brews it's own beer and that's it.  There's nothing special about it at all.  In fact, it attempts to be cooler than it is, and I believe it's operating under an antiquated business model that was concocted before Micro Brews flooded the market.    The place believes it has something special to offer, but with over priced mid grade beers, why not just go to four peaks, or a bar with a hip tap like papago?   They are cocky about the fact that they brew beer and spew out factoids about how Dan Biersch went to the renowned Weinstephaner brewing school in Germany.  Well I got news, Dan Biersch probably hasn't even stepped foot in the Tempe location and has no hand in their brewing practice other than the recipe he emailed to the brewmaster, so I don't give a rats ass about him.   Go here if you want to hit up a Crapple B', Chili's, TGIF spot, because it is better.    If you want a personal belly warming beer experience... go somewhere else.",

Took 10 minutes to get menu's, another 15 for the waitress to come so we could order drinks, was there for almost 30 min before we got to order food. They never cleared our table and we sat waiting for 30 min with empty glasses and no bill. The food was decent but considering the wait time for an empty restaurant it was definitely not worth it. The waitress was rude, extremely slow and not helpful at all. Over horrible experience.",

I stood around confusedly for a few moments, got the attention of another bartender, and was told that they weren't serving alcohol until later in the evening.  I turned around, walked down to Casey Moore's, had lunch, drank several beers, and wondered if I had hallucinated my Gordon Biersch experience.",

I sat down to watch the Suns beat the Grizz last night and was relatively by myself at the bar. My iPhone was dead so the usual texting and internet surfing to keep myself busy wasn't available. The girl bartender was pretty talkative and the guy behind the bar while kind of a douche was fairly interested in the game and asking me a lot of questions. It's not normal to go somewhere in Tempe and have a bartender do anything but ignore you.  I ordered a Southwest Chicken Sandwich and about 5 minutes later the wrong order came out. She apologized and re-ordered the correct one and I watched her type rush in on the order. Well 33 minutes later (I read what time the ticket order was placed) my sandwich finally came. The other patrons around me were cracking jokes about me starving and such, the bartenders comped a couple beers, and I was pretty good spirited about it. When it finally came, I don't know if it was because of the built up anticipation or what, but that wasn't a very good $10 sandwich. A shitty processed chicken patty, red peppers, and some mayo don't exactly scream that a lot of thought went into it.   My experience was so mixed that I really had to break it down to four categories. The service was top notch 5 stars, the food was a total let down and I'll give it 2 because it was still edible :) Kitchen service is shit 1 star, and the atmosphere is one of the best for watching the game, so 4 for that. overall 3 stars is fair.",

Their chicken wings are about the best things since sliced bread.  Their beer sampler is one of the best, and I LOVE their salads.    BUT....... out waiter must have forgotten his manners, or never been taught them altogether.  I hear a lot of waiters biggest complaints are rude customers, but may I speak for myself in saying that I ALWAYS say please and thank you for everything and I'm usually awarded the same respect in return, but for this waitor, that just wasn't the case.  That turns me off right away when I'm dining out, especially when I am paying extra for their services.  I've been in the customer service industry for over 10 years now, and I know it's not always fun, but is it too much to ask for a little common courtesy?  Okay, I'm done rambling...  The food here is awesome.. so it's A-OK in my book ;)",

    "text": "First: This is the tallest restaurant I've ever been to.  Second: They give pretty generous servings of beer in ironically tall glasses. Their wines are pretty good too.  Third: Mr. Biersch's brewery and eatery, when it comes down to it, is really just a fancy version of BJ's minus the flatscreens projecting the latest sports event. The food isn't that great. Most American food restaurants fit within the nexus of the TGIFriday's scale: a fancy version of TGIFriday's being the best, Normal TGIFriday's being just TGIFriday's, and Poor Man's TGIFriday's being something like Denny's. This spot falls into the fancier version of TGIFriday's. You get the picture. I ordered a veggie pizza which literally was a thin-crust pizza that someone dumped a bowl of spinach on top after it came out of the oven. It's how a jock understands vegetarian eating.  Fourth: The staff is really friendly, but ultimately really busy because they're understaffed. It's probably related to our nation's clusterfuck to the poor house, but I think it's a restaurant's job to make sure that the customers are seen to.  Fifth: Their food is overpriced for what it is.  Sixth: This place isn't that bad, it just has no soul. It is what it is. You go for a burger, you go to drink, or you go to watch a game. Maybe a combination of all three.  Seventh: If you're a diehard about this place, at some point in your dining life your idea of class was probably something along the lines of drinking champagne in Hooters.",

    "text": "To celebrate the end of institute, and leaving Phoenix, my collaborate work group decided to have a celebratory dinner. There were 9 of us in all, and so it was suggested that we come here. Cool, whatever, brewery.   First of all, the service was extremely helpful and attentive. From the beginning, our main server asked us how we would break down the check, and if it were possible to consolidate credit cards among us so we'd be able to get out faster. She was very polite and ready to accommodate, even though she was training someone new at the same time.    When we arrived, someone immediately took our drink orders. Most of us started with cocktails, and 2 people got beers--big mistake on the majority. The Manhattan and Tom Collins my friends got were extremely watered down, with very little alcohol, and my SF lemonade tasted like lemonade. Only. Apparently the beers, though, were very good, and the next round, that's what everyone ordered.   As a group we decided to split appetizers: A chef's platter (with Southwest Chicken Eggrolls, barbecue buffalo wings, and potstickers), and 2 baskets of garlic fries. We were all starving after our last day teaching so we dove in as soon as the food arrived. The buffalo wings were sweet and barely spicy at all, although the chicken had a nice crispness to it. The Southwestern eggrolls were bland, so I dipped them in ranch, and the garlic fries were very greasy--the garlic was minced and spread over the fries, so there wasn't much flavor and since it was raw minced, somewhat intense.  At this point, we were starting to get full, when our entrees actually arrived. I tried:   Beer battered fish and chips - The fish was NOT beer battered. It was breaded. Your generic whitefish, a texture as if fried after freezing, but drier than usual because of the breading. It was served with a mound of those same garlic fries and a \"Cajun roumalade\"--basic, orange tarter sauce that just tasted like tarter. I had to add a lot of vinegar and Tabasco to make this taste like anything.  Marzen bacon burger - I had a bite of my friend's burger and it was pretty good: nicely charred meat, crisp bacon. I like my meat a little rare, though, and the burger was well-done all the way through, and a little tougher than my preference.   Steak sandwich (don't know the actual name) - Another friend had a steak sandwich, which was a steak cooked medium rare with caramelized onions, a garlic alioli (or so she said, I couldn't taste it), gorgonzola, and arugula on a French roll, and the same ubiquitous garlic fries. The steak was pretty tasty and the sharp gorgonzola complemented it well. I could barely taste the arugula, however, and was in fact convinced it was actually spinach.   Other people all had about the same to say about their food. It was too much and kind of bland. The portions of the food were pretty ridiculous. I know its a brewery but the plate was twice the size of my head.   For a watery cocktail and mediocre food, I paid about 26 bucks, which to me is just too much for something I'm unsatisfied with. 1 star for the service, 1 star for the ambience, which was pretty conducive to a group dinner (even with the Nascar racing on the flatscreens poised all about us). No stars for the drinks, the food, and the price.",

Great outdoor seating of Mill avenue, with planes landing overhead in the northeast.  Consistently good service & food, and I never miss the garlic fries.  Pizzas are a good choice as well if you're dining alone.  This was the original Gordon Biersch in Arizona back in the 90's and I wish they had some of their old ways - using 1 litre steins upon request, dunkel was on tap year round, as was the blonde bock.  They serve primarily German style lagers and ales which are almost all low hopped beers, so ignore the other reviews which are ignorant in their critique by complaining at the lack of highly hopped beers.  You don't go to a German themed beer place and expect something out of theme.  Silly.",

He knew a lot about the Tempe area's fast paced history which endeared him to all of us.He was engaged,present and it was obvious he made it a point of bringing excellence to the table.Yes,pun intended. The food was plentiful,fresh and tasty. The prices fair for the portion and quality. Would I be back?Yes,under similar circumstances. Personally I despeise all that is Mill Ave with it's frat boy and girl mentality and am hard pressed to venture east of 24th street. I wasn't expecting much from a place I deemed \"touristy\",but was ever so pleasantly surprised!",

After the tour my wife and I sat outside to have a beer and some dinner.  I had the wedge salad which was very good and the meat loaf.  The meat loaf was excellent.  They give you a huge portion and I probably shouldn't have eaten it all but I did anyway.  The taste was excellent and the addition of sausage was a nice touch though a bit on the salty side.  The Sex And The City thing was pretty stupid and didn't really mesh with the brewery thing.  They just had some girly drink specials all sponsored by Absolut.  I didn't have anything and I still don't want to see the movie.  I still don't understand why this place doesn't have a regular happy hour.  They have a reverse one which is pretty much useless but I guess it is better than nothing.",

There are multiple levels of things to see, there's the brewery itself, where you eat, and merchandise. We ate outside on the balcony which has a great view. Inside had huge televisions to enjoy watching whatever you wanted while you ate. The location of the place was great as well, its right in Tempe and has lots to do and see around it. The Food and drinks here were great as well!  My family and I tried multiple meals and drinks and loved them all. I will definitely revisit this place when i go back out to AZ!",

The food was above average in taste but I would be afraid to check out the nutritional value of what I ate!  If beer is your thing, I think you will be happy with the variety and some of the more unique offerings.  Expect pub food and service and you won't be disappointed.",

I was here with some friends for my buddies birthday last night, and while the food wasnt the best that night, service was awesome and we got to sit outside in the perfect weather.  Overall I do enjoy the majority of the food. Who cant get enough of those garlic fries?  Of course after dinner, be sure to grab a mint.  The place is split into two sides, dinning side and the bar side, which also has some dining areas.  It sits on the second floor right above some club and Starbucks.  Coffee and drinking.. oh what a combo.  I love the whole Mill Ave. vibe going and this is a perfect place for this restaurant.  Is it my favorite place to eat in the world? Not even close.. however I will gladly eat here anytime.   Enjoy!",

I wondered when the dirty salad plate dishes would be removed in front of me, and the bar counters wiped down? It had taken awhile. Anyway, once done she was more accommodating, friendlier also with another colleague accompanying me. The Biersch beer selections always good and cold (16 or 21 ozs. The food's normally good quality and plenty of variety selections at moderate pricing. In a nutshell, I've always liked Gordon Biersch's.

We sat at the top (3rd) floor in a corner with glass windows all around us. The view was so beautiful at night.  2. The food was really good too! A bit pricy but good. I got the Cajun pasta, it was good but not the best I had. Would I be ordering another 17 dollar pasta that's just average? Probably not.  Would I go back here for a date? Yup.

The fish and chips is the obvious way to go for me, because they have never disappointed. Upgrade to the garlic fries. Garlic + fried potatoes= HEAVEN.  I have tried the tacos, they were ok, I didn't like the double shell with cheese in the middle of them. Neither tortilla shells were good, and stacked together they took away from the inner yumminess of the taco.  Attached are photos from my latest visit; I got the Gorgonzola Pear Salad. It sounded fantastic, but left me disappointed. It had very little pear, Gorgonzola, and blueberries. Plus, it was supposed to be in a Marzen balsamic vinegar ether, but it was SUPER oily and not acidic whatsoever. Also, the chicken was supposed to be pecan-crusted...but there were no pecans to be found. In fact, the chicken my fiance ordered (Chicken Schnitzel) looked and tasted very similar.  It sounds like they have a great happy hour here, according to other reviews. I expect to come back to try it for myself. I love their beer and their root beer soda. I think I'm going to stick to the fish and chips from now on though.",

We had the full serving it it was just enough for the both of us. We were also greeted by the manager due to it being my first time there. I did forget his name though.

It came with a few toast points and tortillas which were over buttered. My mom ordered the chopped salad which was a nice size portion but the chicken was difficult to find amongst the lettuce. My father ordered the beef tenderloin salad. The dressing was a warm bacon version which was overly sweet and greasy. The salad had 4 small strips of tenderloin which was the toughest cut of meat any of us had ever seen. The spinach was wilting and tasted a few days old. My husband and I shared the California flat bread. The base was solid and tasty but the greens were again wilted and old and the avocado was starting to brown. My side salad lettuce tasted like the lettuce hadn't been washed and was also sour. The best part of the salad was the jalapeno ranch dressing. Our server rarely came by our table,  only to take and deliver orders and bring the check. We waited 15 minutes for our check once we were done picking through our dishes. There were 10 college students working tonight for about 5 parties of customers. Overall we had a terrible experience and it was an awful $75 spent.",

The new Caribbean appetizer platter was gross - the mahi mahi was so over-fried you couldn't' tell what it was, the \"Kobe\" burgers were over cooked, and the sauce for the ahi spring rolls was basically orange mayo. SO, lesson learned - stick to the things we know....artichoke hearts and beer!",

First of all it's in a great location, right on Mill Ave. You go up a flight of stairs and you'll be greeted  and seated usually fairly quickly. If it's not too hot or too cold you might want to try the outdoor patio. The view is nice and it's a bit quieter than the inside. As far as the food goes, it's not 5 star gourmet fair but they make an excellent burger and the garlic fries are out of this world. The beer selection is quite good and the service was prompt and cheerful. I've never had a bad meal or bad service here. Give it a try for yourself and see what you think.",

Happy to see that there are some Gordon Biersch restaurants in CA. Can't wait to go back our friends food looked amazing!",

    "text": "I'm not a big chain restaurant type of person but if I am going to a chain I'd rather go here or Karl Strauss rather than an Applebee's or anything on those lines. I've been in town for the week and this place was the closest to my hotel where I could get some food and watch a World Cup game.  The place is clean, my server was nice, they had the games on and decent food. It's not easy to find a place where you can get a healthy meal and watch a sports game but this was my best option for both of those things I needed. I had the ahi tuna salad which was okay, it was really small but the sauces and dressings tasted really good.  The ahi is nothing compared to what you can get from RA sushi across the street but again I needed the game also. All of the other food around me looked really good though, the table next to me had gotten a BBQ chicken pizza which looked delicious and another table behind me had gotten burgers/sandwiches and fries so this is probably the better choice over raw fish at this type of place.  I've had a veggie burger at the San Fran location and will say that was amazing and I imagine that's on Tempe's menu also. I personally don't drink beer but I do know from others that they have a fantastic beer selection and of course they have wine as well! Overall good place if you're craving beer and burgers and don't want a dive bar or a chain.",

They arrived at the restaurant, needless to say was not busy, and sat down. To wrap up the whole night/situation was the service was slow and non attentive. I don't know whether the fact that this was a group of 17 yr. old kids but the young lady that was their server that night had them wait 40 minutes before taking their order after telling her twice they were ready and her response was \"I'll be right back\" and never came back. The server's attitude was rude. 40 minutes to order, REALLY! They were celebrating a friends birthday, needless to say did not turn out to be very memorable.",

Our table was even located right next to the waiter station area and he would walk by us every two minutes and we even tried to get his attention and he didn't pay much attention to us. We had to asked for napkins, silverware and refills and then finally the check. They are super stingy on their french fries the came with about 25 fries, if that. My house made tacos were more like a salad. There was more lettuce and a few crumbs of fish on the top like if they were bread crumbs. This was my first and last visit here.

It was not busy and our waitress took wayyyy too long to greet us.  After she finally came over, she asked if we wanted drinks and straight up just walked away, didn't even have a chance to order an app.  She probably had more tables then she could handle,.

The have combo meals as well on the HH menu. The happy hour choices are great. We will be back to try the real menu as well, i looked it over and it is pretty intriguing.  We had the beer sampler. No this place dies not have the widest selection of beers but the ones they have are pretty good. Check out the seasonal when you go...they also have a huge list of mixed drinks and wines as well.

The Gorgonzola sauce is the bomb.  I seriously wanted to lick my plate. Their beers are good and I am not a beer drinker at all.  My husband ordered their new pumpkin spice brew and I kept stealing sips, it was so delicious! This location has fantastic atmosphere, being in the middle of the hopping section of Mill Ave.  That being said, parking is horrific on a Friday night.  Our service was really fantastic.  All in all, a great place and we'll definitely return.",

My better half had the Lobster Shrimp Tacos and I had the Fish and Chips. My  wife loved her three tacos. Has to be one of the best seafood tacos that she has ordered. My fish and chips were cooked perfectly, with a light batter with some crunch to it and the cole slaw was okay. Unfortunately, we didn't have any of their brews, but maybe the next time we come back.",

The waiter barely acknowledged us the whole time we were there. One of my guests was late and she sat there for 15 minutes (by this time I was so fed up, I timed it) before our waiter finally slunk over to see if we needed anything - then tried to bolt away without taking her order until we stopped him. Then we had to basically flag him down 10 minutes later to order food.  The restaurant was completely empty - it was not in the least bit busy. As far as I could tell the waiter only had two other small tables. Super disappointed, as was my whole group, we definitely won't be returning to this location.",

    "text": "I've been to several Gordon Biersch locations in different states and on multiple occasions.  This one by far was the worst and not what I've come to expect from Gordon Biersch.  I ordered a Kobe burger with garlic fries. Pretty straight forward right? Wrong. The Kobe burger was bland and looked unappetizing. They didn't bother to season it at all and it looked old.  Next, Gordon Biersch is known for their garlic fries. Well mine came out and again looked completely unappetizing. They were cold, no garlic on them, no seasoning of any sort. They looked like plain French fries. Since it was unlimited fries, I ordered more and it never came out. Did I mention service was super slow?   Next let me share what happened with other people in my party. My friend ordered a cheeseburger with plain fries. They gave her garlic fries. Oh, and by the way...my Kobe burger looked strikingly similar to her burger (like exactly the same). As you can imagine, the Kobe is more expensive because hypothetically speaking, it should be better quality beef.   My other friend had a sandwich with sweet potato fries.  She had unlimited fries and ordered more. It never came.   So overall, I think it's safe to say I won't be returning and I doubt my friends will either.",

We usually go on a Friday night when you would think there would be a lot of people there.  My boyfriend's favorite menu item is the gastro pub burger - he is completely addicted.  We used to try different restaurants along Mill, but since he tried that burger we go nowhere else.  I personally like to mix it up a little.  I have tried the bratwurst sliders, the asian chicken bites, and the sausage platter and all were very good.  Their beer selection used to be very German (boring) but they have really upped their game and offer a wide variety of beers now.  My boyfriend and I really enjoy what we get every time we go.  Give it another try if you last went before all the great menu changes.  They aren't just about the garlic fries anymore.",

His meditterean Chicken appeared healthy as it came off the Heart healthy menu. Enough healthy stuff, my order was stuffed chicken and this was prepared way different than normal, which is usually spinach and cheese inside. In this version, it was goat cheese mostly with some cheddar and sun dried tomatoes. The chicken breast was sliced into four pieces and it was kind of served open face. It looked small, but was filling at 15 bucks (see photo). I switched out the Kale concoction for Garlic mashed potatoes (the garlic fries appetizer was way better) and there was some average veggies on the plate. Perhaps the best item on that plate was the roasted garlic peanut dipping sauce. Truly legendary on that item. Beer here has kind of not changed in many moons - same stuff for years, so maybe a new flavor or two will get that fifth star.  Sunsets are awesome too from here. Orange explosion.",

I enjoyed so many tall glasses of the Martzen, so many baskets of the garlic fries, so much time looking admiringly on your servants dressed up in those creepily evocative brown shirts. Thanks to my Bay Area connections I spent more than a few nights in your care in your San Jose location: The original joint! Hell, on one occasion I was actually mistaken for one of your founders by another regular.  So it makes me wonder what's happening in Tempe. It looks like the whole place hasn't had maintenance in a while. The beer is still good. I've decided to restrain myself from the fries, but they still smell great. But it's as if the whole building is wearing a sad face.  I know that the assh  . . . I mean City Fathers . . . yeah, that's it. . .  of Tempe raised rents on everyone on Mill, hoping to turn Tempe into another Manhattan. We can tell how that worked by how many boarded-up storefronts there are. Everyone else has bugged out to the Riverfront or whatever that is over on the other side of Rural. You are standing firm, and that's to be admired. But see, the longer you stay the more I kinda avoid that location. I'm afraid the fail wave is washing up against your shores as well.  So I would do what needs to be done to dress the place up a bit, or make plans to move. Don't miss the tide.",

I will go there for the salmon caesar, but will never stray from my usual order ever again. Unless it's just to pick up a quick order of garlic fries. Those are just yummy!  My friend who introduced me to the place has finally come up with what should be their slogan.... and after going through the latest experiences with them I might have to agree with her. \"Gordon Biersch. We'll just serve you what we want.\"  Let me explain based on my last dining excursion there. My last 3-4 have been about the same.  I arrive with my favorite carnivore who is also my best friend. We are seated promptly and receive our water with no wait. That's always good and they are good at doing this. She orders a burger as she has done for the last 3-4 times. She tells them she wants it medium. I told her she should have said rare because the last several times it came back well done. I strayed from my usual order of salmon caesar and ordered the crab cake sandwich. I asked her if she could substitute the lemon aioli for the tartar sauce, she said sure. I then asked if my garlic fries could be extra crispy and extra garlic and my friend said she didn't want hers that way. Waitress said no problem....  We get our orders. Burger? Well done again, not even close to medium. Fries for my friend? Extra crispy. Crab Sandwich? I had to ask her what the sauce was because it didn't look like the lemon aioli they serve with the appetizer and it didn't look like tartar sauce either. Her response? \"Oh that's our cajun sauce.\" WTH? No asking if I want it? Luckily, I was ok with it. My fries? I got my extra garlic, but they were a little soggy instead of extra crispy.  My friend and I were swapping fries.  We ordered dessert. Should have known better. They don't make their desserts there. That's apparent. The chocolate cake was really dry and their bread pudding was just disappointing (according to my friend). Thank heavens for the vanilla ice cream.... but I could pay much less at DQ.  I will continue to go there for the garlic fries because addicts need to get their fix too. I've learned not to stray from my usual order. Their salmon is never over salted, and always cooked perfectly.",

    "text": "Looking for a mediocre dining experience coupled with inattentive staff for which you can overpay? Look no further than Gordon Biersch!  \"A less tasty, more expensive BJ's,\" as a I typically refer to it, Gordon Biersch is frustrating in its shockingly bland menu, served by staff who don't know how to keep a drink refilled (but frequently just hang around and chat amongst themselves) and quickly stop caring about you once the food is delivered.  I've had a number of bad experiences, from waiting nearly an hour and a half to get our (by then, lukewarm) food during their busy time, with nary a care from our waiter, to having the wait staff completely abandon us after delivering the check, despite it being a slow weeknight and the fact that we were clearly sticking around to talk business for awhile.   The menu is like an upgraded Applebees. The food is shocking in its blandness, like a hodgepodge of tex-mex, americana, and stunning mediocrity. Entrees will routinely run you between $16-$20 and won't be worth it, they won't cook a burger the way you ask, (\"to a minimum of 155\") and things are just generally unpleasant.  People love the garlic fries, but it's just shitty frozen fries doused in what I imagine is canned garlic. I'm not expecting the world here; it's a chain micro-brewery, but these fries do NOT deserve the rave reviews they sometimes get.  The pasta dishes are more of the same: Sysco or thereabouts quality but just wholly lacking flavor and inspiration. Everything feels phoned in, and the entire place just rubs me the wrong way. I've had the misfortune of continuing to come back because it's close to my office and clients like it for some reason.   Generally, I'll avoid if at all possible. It really leaves a lot to be desired at prices that magnify their shortcomings.",

Nothing memorable except for the garlic fries. The service each time I have visited has been terrible. Inattentive servers, empty glasses, empty plates.   Go for the view and a beer and then go elsewhere for dinner.",

    "text": "We're so done with this place.  Years ago Gordon's was such a great place to go for lunch when there was a fun festival on Mill Ave, or for dinner when you and your friends were going out for some fun. Now Gordon's is a place full of constant disappointments. A couple months ago we went to the Gordon's in San Tan Village and we were served cold, tasteless food. A month later we decided to give them another try and it happened again. This time I wrote to Gordon's telling them of our unsatisfactory visits, and they were very courteous and mailed us gift cards while encouraging us to give them another try.  Today we visited the Mill Ave location and regardless that the food was free because of the gift cards I wished we hadn't gone. We sat in the self seating area near the bar. Our server was very standoffish and you could tell he didn't want to be there at all. He brought us our soda's and took our order but he didn't bother to ask how we wanted our burgers cooked, nor did he ask which option we wanted for our sides. While waiting for our food I noticed both of our glasses were dirty and had old food remnants in them!! I grabbed another server who was walking by and told her. She apologized and took the glasses. A few minutes later she brought our new sodas over and said, \"Well we serve lemons and strawberries in our glasses from the lemonades but they were sterilized so the food pieces in them were clean so it's okay.\" Are you effing kidding me!? Finally the food came and just like the San Tan Village location the food was cold, and absolutely tasteless. We finished our meal gave the gift cards to the server and left.   Seriously, if you're looking for a fabulous burger, great beer, excellent service and an a fun atmosphere please take the time and go to the San Tan Brewery which is in Chandler off of Arizona Ave and Chandler Blvd in the old town area. You won't be disappointed! As my dad would say, they could sell their burgers in India they're so good. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.santanbrewing.com%2F&s=06b4401e285570240c8d13c3e250a6f73b0a90e079e938c9c5a89deab9c405ff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">santanbrewing.com</a> However, if you're in Tempe and don't want to drive all the way to Chandler (and okay with fighting for parking) try Four Peak's Brewery, they're also fantastic.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fourpeaks.com%2F&s=4e90e57f2c123bae117d34da715d83dc1de556d834e80e64648c70232970948d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">fourpeaks.com</a>",

We came a little after 1:30 which turned out to be great!  Because, it was not very busy. Which was awesome. Our server was very good and very attentive. I do not like the water they serve, it is tap water, and if not it sure tastes like it. So I drank only my Hot Tea. We both had a fantastic meal. I had the Seafood Cobb salad with crab meat. My friend got the Salmon Caesar Salad, Both absolutely delish! Then because, it was her Birthday, she got to choose any Dessert from the Menu. I thought that was pretty nice. She chose the Bread Pudding. Oh my gosh!!! Wonderful,Wonderful! We had a great afternoon here.  Restrooms are nice and clean. There is an elevator if you do not want to walk 2 sets of stairs when you come in. Plus, when it cools down you can sit on the Balcony. You must pay to park,thank you Tempe. The days of free parking are long gone.  You can't stop Progress. All in all , great place,we loved our lunch and the service.",

Several of us got the sliders, ordered medium, medium-rare and well-done, but they all seemed to be cooked the same. We also got the mussels (not great), the spinach artichoke dip (good!) and the nachos (great!).  The upstairs dining is also a bonus. You can get some great views of Tempe.

The 2nd warning shot should have been waiting 15 minutes for our menu, another 20 minutes for our appetizer and then 30 minutes for our overcooked totally bland food that was barely luke warm. They beat all the flavor out of the Kobe beef sliders to the consistency of shoe leather.  And then the food finally shows up, definitely not even warm. My son's 1/2 pound burger was supposed to be medium...nope.  My gorgonzola rib eye was supposed to be medium rare...again, nope.  Obviously the kitchen can only cook everything well done & suck all the flavor out.  My daughter's salad was completely forgettable.  The one saving point was the strawberry lemonade.  Probably bought somewhere else. Is it any wonder that 4 Peaks is ALWAYS full and this place was a ghost town?  Not to us. And then the final kick in the pants was the $85 tab for a meal that made was completely underwhelming.  Service was so-so. We went here because I got gift certificates for Father's Day and will never return.",

We came primarily for the beer and they were out of seasonal/specialty beers. Disappointed, I settled for the Marzen which was fine. From that point service was fine. I was looking forward to the Farmhouse Burger with Bacon Jam and fried egg. I ordered Medium and got very well done. Same with my wife. There was no evidence of bacon jam. The burger had very little flavor (probably for being overdone)",

    "text": "In town for business for a few days, I dined here twice with a group each time. Once for lunch, once for dinner. Good experiences both times, although the food was a little mixed.   For lunch, I went with the German Kobe Beef Burger. It was large, but didn't have a of flavor. There was about a tablespoon of sauerkraut on it as well, which (taste-wise) was about on par with the rest of the burger. Okay, but not a lot of flavor.   Disclaimer: Please take my criticisms of any German cuisine with a grain of salt. I lived there for 11 years and the Germans spoiled me with their cooking. It's not entirely fair for me to compare authentic German food prepared by Germans with our best American shot at the same. Unless they hired a German cook. In which case he should be ashamed of himself...  Okay with that out of the way, let's move on to dinner the following evening, shall we?   I went with the server's recommendation again (I'm doing this a lot lately). She recommended the fish tacos so I went with them.   They were truly outstanding!!!! The absolute best tacos I've had, hands down. I'm not exaggerating, they were really that good. And they even come out on these cool little metal stands that keep your taco upright until you're ready to pick it up and have at it. Pretty nice.   They also came with a side of white rice covered in black beans. Also very good.   And on both occasions the service was impeccable. There's a large dining area and a bar too if you prefer to dine solo like that. Or with a group. It's really up to you.   And there's outdoor seating, too.   All in all, I've been a big fan of Gordon Biersch restaurants everywhere I've gone in the country. And Tempe, AZ, keeps the tradition alive.",

I opted for a house salad- lettuce, 2 kinds of cheese, nuts, cucumbers and dressing in a small bowl for $5.95.  And a side of potato wedges topped with gorgonzola.  Both were just okay.  Service was good.  It annoys me that restaurants on Mill Ave don't validate parking tickets from the garage anymore.",

    "text": "I was pretty pleasantly surprised by Gordon Biersch Brewery.  I'm not generally a huge fan of chains, but I was in town and a friend said it was pretty good so what the heck!  We were there at an admittedly odd time - I think it was around 4:30 on a Friday.  We're both midwesterners so while it was happy hour local time, our stomachs were quite insistent that it was time for dinner.  We ended up ordering one appetizer and one dinner to split - and it turns out we had more than enough food.  The appetizer was a Mediterranean thing - pita, hummus, tapenade and a pile of roasted garlic.  Oh, if only I didn't have to talk to people all weekend...    It was very, very good, and they offered to bring more pita bread as we still had lots of spreads but had gone through our allotment.  We also got pecan crusted chicken medallions in a creamy Marzen (one of their featured beers), which was also very, very good.  Nicely cooked and seasoned, and even though it was probably sauteed, it wasn't greasy.  I had the Czech Pilsner, my friend had the Marzen - both were quite good.  I'd definitely try both again.",

We sat for 15 minutes before a waitress finally asked us if we had been greeted yet, and when she discovered we hadn't said that she would \"steal\" this table from the other waitress and take care of us. It was not busy by any means, but the waitresses seemed to be more interested in gabbing than working. When our foodl arrived 2 of the 3 of us were less than thrilled with our meals. I had the fish tacos which had little meat and little taste to them at all. The other thing I really need to address is the foul smell that hits you when you step inside the door. I don't know if it is a sewer issue or old beer smell, but it isn't pleasant.",

We order the beer sample which didn't require those types of glasses. After about another 15 mins (I was timing it) he kept talking to the girls by the wash area.

The second time there was a little wait to get seated no big deal it seems like a pretty busy place.   The most recent time there was a fifteen minute wait for a table. The bar was empty so we waited there. HOWEVER upon further inspection (I looked around) the place seemed no busier than the first or second time, plenty of tables open, seemed strange to me. Well after a few beers we were seated at one of the open tables. Now by this time the bar was full so I suspect that I was a 'plant' to gather more people at the bar. My only concern had this been the case, is that I was not complimented for doing such a good job.  Oh and if you like wheat beers, their hefeweizen is is not half bad...",

The restaurant is on the second floor of the building. We were seated at a high top table overlooking the street. Loved watching the hustle and bustle below us.   I love craft beer so I got a sampler to try several different ones. I ordered the Chicken Schnitzel for my entree. It came with spatzle which I love. One of the reasons I chose this dish was the white wine and lemon caper sauce. The chicken was very good but the sauce could have used a little less lemon for my taste.   This is a cool place to hang out and try unique beer. The service was good. I can't wait to go back and try another chef crafted entree.",

I took it to the third floor first and had to walk down, oh that was hard!  Server was very friendly with nice smile. He let me sample three different beers to help me decide what I wanted. Dark German bier was the best for me and I surely enjoyed my drink. So tasty but strong, one was enough. Good thing I didn't have to drive home.  I always like their garlic fries. Anything garlic is very good. Unfortunately Kobe beef burger wasn't what I remember it to be. Tasted like they used regular beef.   Located in the heart of downtown Tempe. Sit outside balcony and enjoy the sunny AZ weather while watching people or dine inside with lots of TV playing some sort of sports. Good beer, good service, what else?",

    "text": "This was my first meal in Tempe ad they set the bar high. It was actually my second time at a Gordon Biersch location and I will say that this location is the better of the two. The location is super convenient, on the corner. It is upstairs. They have an elevator though.   The hostess allowed us to sit anywhere and we chose to sit at a table near the outdoor patio area. It was a bit too hot to sit outside, but I would say if the temperature is down, the outside dining area is probably the best dining view in the city.   I started with the Asian Chicken Bites which were crispy chicken bites tossed in an excellent Hawaiian teriyaki sauce with chiles, green onions and sesame seeds. The sweet lemon glaze was drizzled on the side of the plate, which was a bit odd, especially since we were sharing the starter. For my meal, I ordered the seafood cobb salad. It came with a hefty portion of shrimp and shredded crab, tomatoes, avocado, hard-boiled eggs, cucumbers, bacon, cheddar and pepper jack cheeses. It was excellent and an overall above average portion. My friend ordered the salmon and was disappointed. We cracked up over the weird service. Our server admitted that he's OCD and kept stopping by our table, finally after three times of him asking if he could take away the chicken bites, I said: \"take them\".  Overall the food was excellent but the service was weird. My friend insisted that I'd called and told them that I was on the YES. No, we don't roll like that. But, I have to say service was strange and even the manager was a bit extra, even offering us free dessert.",

    "text": "I went to Gordon Biersch Brewery after Octoberfest 2013, and needless to say I was already buzzin and wanted to have some good food, because well Octoberfest failed to provide.  Anywho , as we strolled down Mill Ave my friend recommended Gordon Biersch Brewery, and I said \"what the heck why not\" It was going to be a new experience for me. Well as we walked up the 3 flights of stairs I was very impressed with such a nice place. It was clean, we sat outside on the 2nd floor overlooking Mill Ave and it was such a nice view.  We had 2 delicious \"Hefeweizen\" beers and they were absolutely wonderful, fresh, yummy with a hint of Banana as the aftertaste, It was liquid heaven indeed.   My friend and I both had the Marzen Burger with garlic fries and it was good.  The server was great, gave us a lot of attention and served us with a smile. All in all it was a fun experience.   We had purchased some candles at octoberfest and we had these tiny bags to hold our stuff in, and somehow accidentally left our bags on the table after we had paid for our food.  We simply walked out and left it behind.  Later that evening, just before Gordon Biersch Brewery had closed we realized that we didn't have our stuff with us. I immediately called them at 11pm and asked if we had left our bags there, and they quickly said yes, the Gentleman I spoke with was \"Mike\"   So the next day I took off work early, invited my buddy to tag along and have another round of Hefeweizen's in the afternoon and this time we took the elevator rather than walk up the flight of stairs, and the elevator takes right into the dining area, very classy.  So once again I took the patio, shared a few Hefenweizen's and was treated good. Thanks again Mike for holding onto my candles and not letting anyone rip me off.  Such a class act, I will definitely be back and bring along my Dad to give him a taste of a new beer and EXCELLENT SERVICE!",

The place is a bit pricey. However, I have never been disappointed by the food. I brought my friend here in April. She still talks about this place once in a while.  \"John, do you remember the flat bread from that one restaurant on Mill?\" \"John, the food here isn't good as that one restaurant on Mill.\"  The place is usually packed and the servers are attentive. They have to be since they're making 18% tips on such expensive entrees. I read some of the 2-star reviews. If your server sucks, don't tip and write a complaint on the receipt. But give this place another chance. (Just don't get the same server).",

    "text": "It used to be great. We came in before the dinner rush for a family dinner for 8. Sat in the very sticky (seriously my shoes are still sticking to everything) bar area and ordered some drinks and apps before moving to our table. Garlic Fries and Flatbread were good, but drink menu was limited because they were out of mint and 1/3 of their cocktail menu uses mint.   One big thing that I couldn't help but notice when I walked up the stairs are all of the bins full of water surrounding the hostess podium, look up and there's major leaks coming from the ceiling...um, okay? We're not talking a waterfall, but definitely a steady stream of water pouring through different areas of the ceiling. No acknowledgment even when it was mentioned.  So we sit down and place our orders. I've been before and do credit the selection. It's 6:30 now on Thursday night and we are the only table. Based on the food, I can see why. Chicken sandwich was inedible. The chicken was stringy and old like the bacon, looked like it was reheated in microwave. The taste? There really wasn't much taste, just salty. The shredded lettuce was subpar to even Applebee's and the roll didn't help either. I filled up on garlic fries and after we paid and I ventured straight over to Silvermine for a real dinner.  The rest of my inlaws were mixed on their reviews of dishes (lobster Mac - okay, fish and chips - pretty good, steak tacos - no).  Overall, this place used to be nice, but food quality and atmosphere have taken a major tumble. I wouldn't be surprised if this spot is called something else next year.",

The sandwich came with a large serving of cole slaw and a mountain of pork with the top bun off to the side.  Unfortunately, the slaw was completely tasteless. I really don't understand this...how is it possible to have tasteless cole slaw? There was cabbage...there was some white-ish stuff...no taste.

It is centrally located on the corner of Mill and Fifth Street in downtown Tempe, amongst quite a few other local restaurants. During my most recent visit I ordered a steak at lunch along with one of the seasonal brewed beers. Steak was okay but I wouldn't order it again. Beer was exceptional, so I wasn't unhappy overall.  I love burgers and I think I'll stick to that as my primary choice when eating here in the future. I can't think of any times when service was particularly unsatisfactory, nor were there times when service really stood out as exceptional. I have almost always eaten here on a Saturday afternoon, and it's typically been fairly busy during the lunch hour. Never had a problem getting a table, which is important since I'm usually heading back for an afternoon conference session.  I love the big glass beer mugs (not sure what size they are) but I can't always down the whole thing during a short lunch break (I'm a lightweight).  Overall, good place to eat if you're hungry and in the downtown area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here.",

My drink was more expensive than what I ordered, which was burnt and dry. SO! If you are looking for a place that has hugely expensive drinks, dry usual food, and oddly posh service for some unknown reason. Then look no further! burning 20 dollar bills?  Do it here ;)",

Didn't really feel like paying an arm and a leg for hotel resort food so I ventured off into the desert, on foot, to find some yummy food.   I sat in the bar area since seating was at a premium in the restaurant. It was a Friday night. I ended up ordering a Margarita since it was national Tequila day. It was pretty good. For vegetarians there wasn't a lot of non-meaty foods to eat. I ended up ordering a bunch of different sides for my meal. The food was really tasty and didn't cost me too much.   Unfortunately, the service wasn't great and it did take a long time get served. But then again, it was a busy Friday so I didn't really mind. If I'm ever in Scottsdale again, I'll probably do a little more researching to find a place that's a little more local and a little less of a chain.",

Most of the table got a sandwich of some sort- the kobe burger looked really good and the BBQ bacon burger is excellent. Their garlic fries are loaded with fresh garlic and parsley- make sure to have a breath mint or gum handy after digesting those (they are really good dipped in Ranch).  The place is a little pricey- a burger and 2 beers with tip is easily approaching $25-$30 range so be prepared.",

They have hand crafted beers, don't expect any domestic beers. The food selection is amazing. You can have anywhere from the basic cheeseburger, to Kobe beef burgers. Today I had ahi tuna  and it was cooked perfect. It was served with a kale and quinoa salad. Perfect for lunch. They get deducted a star because the service was just a tad slow and all the windows are filthy with fingerprints. It doesn't take much to wash the windows.",

The tomatoes on my wedge salad were literally mush because they were so old, I could eat any of the salad because I was afraid to get sick. Gross! The steak was ok but I couldn't eat that either because of the tiny, cheap plastic utensils, the kind you would probably get from a gas station. I did go down to the lobby of my hotel and get 'real' plastic utensils, the food was cold by then. Thumbs down",

The beer was also good, but was warm by the time it came to the table.  I was with a group of 6 and everyone else said the same.  Our server must have been having a rough time, even though it wasn't busy at all.  He was doing everything but helping us.  Took 15 minutes for us to be greeted at the table, then the food took far too long (maybe 30 minutes or more) and then he never checked back on us during the meal and after being there for over an hour we had to get up, go get him to get the check... where he was socializing with a coworker while washing windows.  I'm all for a clean restaurant but come on man... washing windows instead of taking care of your guests?  That's just ridiculous.  Prioritize dude... prioritize.

I think we were dressed appropriately (especially since everyone else in the dining room was wearing casual clothes and shorts). However, the hostess refused to seat us in the dining room. Maybe because it was all Caucasian people in the dining room and we were a party of 2 Asian girls, 1 Caucasian girl, and 1 African American girl. The hostess attempted three times to get us to not eat in the dining room. After I refused, she grudgingly sat us near the other patrons. This set a very negative tone for the rest of our meal.  I had the root beer (bland), calamari (can't see why it gets such rave reviews), garlic fries, and lobster bisque.",

Both meals were very good, although the fries were served cold (well slightly warm but not hot) Our server was very good personable, helpful and attentive. I ordered a 20oz beer about halfway into the meal and it was about 2 oz under poured.  This is a personal pet peeve. Some will say \"its suppose to have that much head\" more than a half an inch for me is too much but that's just me.  Over all not a bad meal but not worth the $68 total price (including tip) So here is the breakdown  Ice tea - Ok Margarita - Crap Flight - good Chopped Salad - Good Kobe Burger - Good  Fries - Cold 20 oz beer - under poured  Happy hour prices were not honored on the patio.

Our waitress was visibly upset and snatched the receipt and stormed off. She came back with the split check (for which we thanked her), she huff'd and walked away. Not something that would cause me to tell people not to go, but be aware that check splitting may be frowned upon!",

    "text": "Even though those of us in the valley are blessed with all kinds of local brewery options, (Four Peaks, Sonora, Papago, etc.), sometimes I get a hankering to visit Gordon Biersch for one simple reason:  garlic fries.  I'll admit that all their food options, while good, scream out \"I'm a menu item from a giant chain brewery\" and lack that little something that makes it unique to your area.  Over the years I think that the quality of their beer has gone downhill.  The only thing really drinkable here is the Marzen, along with a couple of their seasonal brews.  As for plusses of this place, I'd really recommend sitting on the patio/terrace, which is great for sitting on and watching all the goings on happening on Mill.  Another plus is the staff: HOT!  Thank the lord for the close proximity to ASU and a great talent pool for hiring.  It may just be my tastes and likings, but Gordon Biersch is a bit too upscale for me.  It's tough to get out of these without spending over $25 on dinner and a couple of beers.  As far as breweries go, this is very family friendly, more so than the other options here in the valley.",

They were the bomb-diggity.  The fish tacos were beautiful and delicious.  The Margherita flatbread was good but had a bit too much cheese.  Service was excellent.  A great hangout for a variety of occasions!",

    "text": "Gordon Biersch has an upstairs outside patio, where you can sit and look down at Mill while enjoying food and beer. It's one of the few accommodations that drew me in - not to mention they have their own beer to sample. I chose the seasonal. It was pretty good, although very, very filling. I couldn't even drink 1/2 of it after having dinner (shrimp salad) and another beer (22 oz) prior to coming here. So, if you plan to drink their beer, make sure you bring your extra stomach along. You're gonna need it.   As for the food, never had it. I can't speak to that, but it looks like serve American fare - like pizzas and burgers. They also have a very tempting dessert menu. I should know. My brother and I checked it out last night, after learning you get a free dessert on your birthday. Since it was a birthday for both of us, we contemplated getting one, like the apple bread pudding or the chocolate peanut butter cup pie.   Service was beyond horrible. Sure, we were quickly shown to a table, but it took several moments for our server to come over. She took our drink orders and told us about the free dessert - after all, I did let her know it was a special day. My bro and I drank and talked, enjoying the night air. Yet when we decided to leave, we could not find our server anywhere. We waited. We looked around. We waited some more. We finally decided to get up and leave. We found her standing at the hostess table doing nothing. That's when she was like, \"Do you guys want to close your tab out?\" Uh, yeah. That's what we wanted 20 minutes ago, missy. So, we slapped down $15 (our tab was $14 for one beer and one Rum Runner - whoa) and left.   \"What if we had wanted something to eat?\" my brother asked. \"Yeah, I said. She didn't even check.\" We just shook our heads and both agreed we probably wouldn't ever go back. Or, if I did, I'd know not to set my expectations too high.  On a more positive note: my brother did say it was the best Rum Runner he's ever had. That's gotta be worth something, right? I've had their mojitos before - meh. While I know they have a full bar, I think having their own in-house brewery is very cool.",

They had some great specials, and we've been looking forward to visiting for another HH.  And just the view from the balcony is awesome. I love looking down on Mill Ave.",

I came here with my friend who was visiting from California, and even though she is a bit high maintainence, our server was still friendly and helpful.   The food was good - although I've heard amazing things about their garlic fries, it really wasn't my thing. I did like our pizza, though... we had a yummy roasted chicken and garlic pizza (I guess that's why the garlic fries weren't sp appealing, probably garlic overload). I'd definitely come here again - it's a nice place to hang out and isn't as obnoxious as the other Mill places.",

    "text": "We moved to Tempe Town Lake & we were at Biersch almost daily to meet friends, family, have burger & a few beers, & enjoy the patio.  The food is just eh people go here for the beer & patio.We thought this would be a great place to spend our New Years Eve. I called a week in advance to check on my reservation I had made the week before and they could not find it.  I called days in advance to check on the reservation again they did not see the res that I had made twice.  I literally called hours before the event to check on my res and guess what? They couldnt find it.  I spoke with the mgr it was a man and I dont recall the name unfortunately.  He told me that I could not make a res for the night that they were not taking any.  I told him I had just spoken with one of the girls 30 minutes prior & that I was getting a head count & confirming my guests & I was now calling back to confirm.  He said ok in that case he would take my res.  I had such an uneasy feeling about this whole thing so I called again about an hour before we were to show up and OMG they still could not find a reservation for us.  I am not kidding.  The girl took the res and assured me it would be fine.  We show up go to the hostess and ask for our reservation for 12 they said they did not have a res for us.  Again not joking.  I stood there in complete disbelief but kept my calm & just tried to get to the bottom of it.  There were 4 young hostesses standing in front of us & none of them could find this reservation.  I looked over their little podium and could see my name scribbled on their reservation paper so I pointed to it & said isnt that it?  The first hoestess said oh, the second oh, the third oh, the 4th said oh.  It was like an SNL skit.They set up a table for us near the window as requested.  When we first got there we only had 4 of our 12 people because others were on their way & we had arrived an hour early in case we ran into problems which we did.  Not even 5 minutes after we were seated a group of people walked up and stood near our table looming over us looking at us weird and then the groups spokesperson came over this guy was a Tony Soprano type & he said Hey is this your table? I said are you serious right now?  He says ya how do you know this is your table?  Lets see we made a \"reservation\" and we are sitting here.  Is this happening right now?  This guy was pissed.  He told us to get up and move and hes got 12 people standing behind him.  He said this isnt your table this is my table I made a reservation.  I told the guy to go take a flying leap and leave us alone.  He bitched and moaned loudly that the waitress told him we were randoms and that we just walked in and sat ourselves. He wouldnt shut his face.  I did my best to ignore the idiot.  Our waitress came over and apologized for this idiots behavior and the waitress that said we just sat ourselves. The idiots party was sat near our table where they taunted us all night toasting to us in the most negative ways you could think of.  All of us tried to just ignore it.  They were telling the server they were rolling on E and then she would come over and tell us about it.  We stepped out to the balcony to watch fireworks around 10 and the idiots were out there.  I thought I could easily ignore it and get along but they were all psycho drunk and drugged out and still going on and on about us taking their table it was beyond nuts so I just said hey lets get past this and have a good time.  They seemed to take that well until one of the men from our party stepped out to the patio. All the idiots ganged up on him got in his face and one of our other guys tried to step out to save him but they stopped the door from opening with their feet.  Panic set in for me and I tried to push my way out there to break up the insanity.  Somehow we settled it all down before something happened but those guys were threatening us.  Our guys went back in and sat down.  Just before midnight I stepped out to the patio again to see what was happening on the street and that party of people was again out there smoking and insane going on and on about us and how they were kicked out.  We had nothing to do with it I had no idea they were kicked out.  I went to the bathroom and while I was in there WE were also kicked out.  When we first arrived I had asked our server to split up the check and asked will that be a prob she said no.  I was also going to use my Biersch card to get the points but when they kicked us out they turned into A HOLES they would not split the bill and they wouldnt take the Biersch card.  I tried to speak to management on my way out to tell them the insanity we endured all night and the injustice of kicking us out as well.  She could give a crap.  So we went from almost everyday customers that brought 20 people with us on many occasions to none of us have been there since we are all spreading the word and boycotting this joint.  All of that was Bierschs fault. IDIOTS",
