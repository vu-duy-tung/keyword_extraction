We randomly found this place using yelp as we were looking for some kind of desert place.  On arrival, we were not sure if we got the right place, since it looks like a house.  There were some people outside the place that were selling necklaces, etc..  After getting inside, I realized that this was Native American food.  We unfortunately already ate, but we decided to get desert, so we got the chocolate and butter fry bread.  I am glad I found this place, so at least I can say I tried some Native American food, while out in Phoenix.  It also got really busy as we were leaving.  I would like to come back here.",

I try and I try and I TRY -- but I just can't make fry bread like they do here! The basic recipe for fry bread is so simple (flour, water, oil) you'd think it would be a piece of cake.   But the freindly folks at Fry Bread House obviously know something I don't. Maybe it's the fact that they are native Tohono O'odham Nation members, and I am SO white (as my exchange student son so often reminds me)...  Anyway, check it out for absolutely the best comfort food to be had this side of a heart attack. And I mean that in the best possible way..",

Now you all need to know that I'm from California and we never had fry bread before we came to Arizona--but I discovered that I really like fry bread, like once a year or so.  The Fry Bread House has a decent menu of traditional Arizona Indian foods, including posole, mutton stew and yes, fry bread. It's also a gathering place for urban and 'rez' Indians alike...in a homey atmosphere.  Thank goodness they also have tortillas though! Because fry bread is just packed with lots of fat, salt and flour--not good if you're on a low-fat diet.  Now if they would just add acorn stew to the menu--I'd eat there every week regardless of the sucky parking.",

And were my arteries clogged indeed! The frybread I ordered was good, especially when I sank my teeth into the stuffed mess, could feel the grease stream down my mouth and chin.

Huge reservation attitude! Very pricey! I ordered a taco and bread from facebook marketplace and found that it was better with better pricing! Frybread House I paid over twenty dollars on a taco, four frybreads with one that had powdered sugar. (according to their pricing, it is $3.45 for powdered sugar. They need to find cheaper powdered sugar.) Facebook Marketplace...same purchase...$12; and it was better tasting and faster. I don't know...we need to get some other natives together and give them some competition...",

The fry bread is always fresh (a good mix of crunchy and fluffy), and the green chili stew will leave you sniffling (in a good way, of course). This new location is quite a bit of a downsize, however, and it also looks like they got rid of selling native jewelry on the side. This new location comes with two personal restrooms for the diners, but some might find the parking a bit of a squeeze during their rush hours. Regardless, anywhere that the Fry Bread House goes, I'll be going. Always a fan.",

I ate half a taco for dinner and enjoyed the rest for lunch the next day. As far as ambiance, I love the way this restaurant is laid out- the lines feel very clean and uncluttered, thanks to their unique use of ropes to demarcate the order line. Their string lighting is very kitschy and adds an artistic flair that balances out the modern feel of the space.  The food and ambiance makes me want to bring g everyone I know here- thanks Fry Bread House!",

You should try The Fry Bread House.  We visited there and their sparsely-furnished dining hall was in transition. We overheard they're moving so I can understand. But let's be honest: you're not here for the decor or for a fully-paved parking lot. You want el sabor supremo.  I got the ground beef taco, hubby got the chorizo. Oh wow. So much punch. So salty. So delicious. This is the kind of meal you are sad that bits of cheese and meat are still stuck to the serving paper under the taco and you want to eat them but are afraid of also consuming paper fibers. But you do it anyways because YOLO.  Times visited: 1",

    "text": "This hole in the wall is tucked away off of 7th Ave; you have to keep an eye out to spot it.  Upon first glance, the shack-like eatery might not seem like the most appealing place to grab a bite, but sometimes it's the little crappy looking places that have the most authentic and best-tasting food.  Fry Bread House is one of those places for sure.  Fry bread is just that, fried bread.  It can be eaten in a number of ways, including as a taco shell wrap, and here, they are said to be the best in the state.  The fry bread is thick but airy and is folded in half to create their specialty dishes, fry bread tacos.  We tried the green fry bread taco, stuffed with spicy green chili beef, topped with lettuce and cheese, which was delicious.  My personal favorite was the chorizo taco, filled with spicy chorizo, also topped with cheese and lettuce.  Do not leave without having dessert.  The chocolate and butter fry bread is an award winning favorite, using their secret recipe.  It's basically a slab of fry bread loaded with chocolate sauce, butter, and God only knows how many calories.  We tried it and needless to say, it was amazing.  By the time we left, the line was out the door.  This is one of those places you come to indulge and try out the local cuisine.  We made it a pit stop on our trip through Phoenix, but I highly advise against making this greasy spoon a regular lunch spot.    What it lacked in nutrition, it definitely made up for in taste.  Plus it was super cheap, and great for a quick meal.  I left completely stuffed, but I just had to try it all!  If you're ever in Phoenix, I have to insist that you stop in for a fry bread taco and/or a sweet!",

Indian tacos, fry bread with sugar, and oh my god--the red chili stew.  I think I just drooled a little on my keyboard.    The place does get a little cramped during meal times, but we used to take ours to go and sit in the park after a bike ride down Central and picnic away and then do our best to ride it off afterwards so we weren't wallowing in the guilt of our deep fried pleasures.    Make sure they are open before you make the trek, they have funky hours.",

I ordered the green chile stew with fry bread, and they both were excellent.  I would go back, and do recommend, if your sole criteria is the food.  I did read Yelp reviews before trying this place, and can understand why it has received a number of negative reviews.  The staff was friendly, but not effusive.  My food came out about 5 minutes after I ordered it (I was surprised how quickly).  There were a number of families dining there who clearly didn't mind the physical appearance of the restaurant; my impression was that they were regulars.  It's also really inexpensive.  If the restaurant was clean / up to most restaurant standards, it would easily rate 4 stars.",

    "text": "I thought it was quite good. Los Angeles has almost every type of food, but fry bread is hard to find. The bread did not look or taste overly greasy. I got the green chili bowl and my dad got the red chili bowl. Both were flavorful and pretty spicy. The beef in both chilis was very lean and tender. The red chili had more meat but maybe it's because that's basically the only visible ingredient. The green chili had other ingredients such as strips of green chili and onions, etc. The bowls looked small but by the time we finished them, along with 1.5 pieces of fry bread each, we were stuffed.",

The Indian Fried Bread with Butter and Powdered sugar is very fulfilling, $6.49.  I love it.  If you want to spend less, just get the stew and add on the plain fry bread for $7.99, it is called the \"Joedd Special\", and sprinkle your own powdered sugar on it.  I did that previously.  This time, I didn't have any sugar in the vicinity, so I ordered it separately off the menu, and spent $5.00 more.  It was worth it, though.  I definitely will be back to the Fry Bread House.

The last time I was in AZ which was about 12 years ago, I tried the fry bread Indian tacos and even bought the mix to make at home.  It has been a long time and will have to see if I have pics, but for some reason I don't remember it being this huge, not that I am complaining.     I knew I had to stop by again and introduce my dad to something different.  The fry bread is thick but soft and have a slightly airy quality to it.  For us non-spicy lovers, we got the hamburger filling (ground beef, cheese, and lettuce).  Funny thing is my husband ordered the ground beef combo which we thought came with sauce but the only difference was the addition of refried beans.  Regardless, it was a tasty and filling meal right after our flight in.",

It's overpriced for some limp, rubbery, cold frybread with some cold beans and meat. It only comes with lettuce and cheese. Very overpriced for what it's worth. Actually it was $26 for both food and drinks.   We miss Sacred Hogan!!! Everything was made to order and never disappointed.   I guess for now, we will stick to the food sales from our Native peoples around town. At least you get a plate of food with a drink for around $7.",

My friend and I both got the ground beef not realizing there was shredded beef. I would have liked too try that too. We were hungry after a 6 hour car ride and didn't read the menu in depth. Anyhow, the beef was average in quality. Taste was also average. However when you put the green sauce on, it was a lot better.  My friends and I had fry bread in Alaska too and it seems that this place didn't take time to drip out the oil as much (or pat it out) so we had a lot of oil on the deli paper which they wrapped the fry bread taco in. That wasn't a plus for one of my more health conscious friends. But I just pat the oil out of mine with the napkins they gave us.   For me, there was so much meat in the Indian ground beef taco, I was actually able to split it into two tacos since I had bought extra fry bread just to munch on.",

I knew I wanted cheese and beans, but I also added the ground beef. The food was hot, the fry bread was light, and fluffy.  The beans, cheese and beef were seasoned just right, it melted in my mouth.  Even though the portion is large, I wanted more. My brother ordered the green chili and that would be my only regret.  I will be back for the green chili, it has a nice little kick to it and is amazing.  I will be going back soon.",

My husband and I shared a plain Indian Taco and a Red Chili Indian Taco and my kids tried (and loved) the UFO's, which were silver-dollar sized fry breads with a side of refried beans for dipping.   While it wasn't the healthiest meal, it sure was a tasty once-in-a-while treat. The fry bread was light and fluffy and not greasy at all. The red chili beef was very flavorful with a moderate amount of heat (they serve hot sauce on the side).   I don't know where to get fry bread like this where I live in San Diego, so it was an extra special treat to enjoy it here in Phoenix. We will definitely be back again!",

It is the only place I have brought people and they have gone back on their own, that says alot. I got hooked on the \"Frybread House\" when they were on Indian School and 3rd St. LOL! Two little tables for seating, in the center of the table a flower vase with a plastic flower. Ya, the place was small. Most people are walk in/take out. The fry breads that was to big for the paper plates they were served on only add to the charm. Then they found a bigger place on 7th Ave and it was nice, updated, and still had the charm. Moved again and now coming back. Looking forward to having them back in Melrose (7th Ave) and going to oder one of everything!",

It's a small place and a little difficult to find, but clean, cool, with a friendly staff. And fry bread tacos are amazing.  We both loved the Ultimate Taco. If you like chewy, fried flatbread, you haven't lived until you've had a taco made on it. Go a little out of your way (not far from the airport and Interstate 17) and enjoy a southwestern treat.",

I was along for the ride so I came in with an open mind. I ordered the vegetable beef stew special. It was pretty good, but I had never had fry bread before so I didn't have any expectations.   My biggest complaint would be that we asked for the desserts to go, and we had to go chase down the waitress and have her to bring them to us after we had finished eating our lunches. When they finally did come, they were made to eat at the restaurant so I had to ask the waitress again to have them packaged to go. I am guessing they made a fresh batch to go because it took a while.   The food was good but not to die for. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. And the interior of the place needs work. For a place that supposedly just moved into this location, it sure had a lot of broken tables and out of order bathrooms.",

    "text": "In my first visit to the new location, the food was as good as I remembered from a too-long ago visit to the tiny and now closed 7th Ave location.  I was hungry and pleasantly surprised at how both tasty and filling was but a single bowl of the hearty beef stew and a plain fry bread ($8). The fry bread was fresh and warm, lightly oily, easy to tear into strips, and delicious, with a light, tender texture.  It's walk-up counter order & pay.  Staff then delivers your food on plastic tray, and clears your table after.  The hodge-podge of different style tables, chairs, and booths left over from the location's former occupant, \"Pancho's\", fills the dining room.  Nothing fancy but it works okay.     Off the main dining room a sign designates the attached room \"Indian Market\" and invites the guest to purchase direct from Native American artists. Inside, two Native American women and the daughter of one displayed their jewelry of turquoise, silver, and more on a couple folding tables under too-dim lighting in this, the old Pancho's Mexican Buffet on the south side of Indian School across from Panda Express - and just diagonally across and down the street from \"the other\" well-known fry bread place in town.  I hope the proximity of the two locations is not too damaging to either  It occurred to me that given the size of this place, that with time this could become a happening restaurant and Native American gallery/cultural center. Before that could happen however, there's some  sprucing up to do.  It's an old building that shows considerable wear, and the restaurant was not as clean as it should have been on this occasion: my arm stuck to the first table I sat at, one men's room stall was without TP, and the other had mounds of it on the floor (though was otherwise reasonably neat and clean). To their credit,  the sticky table was cleaned immediately on bringing it the attention of the young woman at the counter.  She also said she would alert someone to the mess of paper on the floor of the larger stall and explained they were having trouble with the ancient toilet paper dispensers unraveling paper to the floor.   Four stars for the food and the pleasant and competent woman at the counter. She was also both friendly and competent in taking orders, answering questions about the food, and running the register.  Minus one star for what I hope are temporary less-than optimal conditions, but the food was very good and I'll be back.",

The fry bread is good enough... of course, anything you deep fry is usually tasty but, the taco was super bland and nothing interesting.  It basically was fried bread with lettuce, beans and some cheese slapped in it.  :-/  When I add the lackluster food to the fact that the man at the counter was not friendly at all... rude actually, I don't have a very satisfied feeling about my experience.  My friend was trying to order the stew and some fry bread and the man treated him like he was dumb for not knowing that you have to order a combo to get both.  Then, when we ask what drinks they had, the man kinda rolled his eyes and pointed to a sign... again, like we should have already know where the sign was or what their options were.  Really?  We walked in and right up to the counter so we didn't have much chance to familiarize ourselves with their exact set-up.  I almost said something but, didn't want any chance of retaliation in our food.   So, my friends stew was full of flavor and my taco had none.  The only saving factor was the dessert fry bread at the end...   I'd go back to try other things if friends invited me again but, I might try to find a different fry bread location since the big guy behind the counter was so rude and condescending at this one.    Prolly won't see ya there.",

However in the hands of masters like these found near Camelback and 7th Ave in Phoenix, the fry bread realizes its True potential.  This location has bounced around a few times, but their new place between Indian School and Camelback on 7th Ave is a nice upgrade from the former places. The converted house has a clean modern interior with lots of Native American art and touches.  Your hardest choice is sweet or savory. Most of the menu focuses on various taco combinations including red and green chile beef. The red is delicious with the green being much hotter.  You can add any number of toppings, but the fry bread can only hold so much stuffing before it oozes all over the plate. Fortunately they hide a fork and knife underneath to help sop up the goodness.  The restaurant also offers burritos and native style tortillas which are worth a taste. Their kids menu is also great with mini fry breads for a combination playtime and dinner.  Everything is done well and very authentic. I highly recommend locals and tourists support this unique and native cuisine in the region.",

    "text": "This place is so good! I'm embarrassed to admit that I've only recently visited here for the first time. Especially being a Phoenix native living close to Guadalupe who grew up on Fry Bread with honey and powdered sugar. Of course my expectations were high for my first visit to Fry Bread House - James Beard recognized and the Green Chili Beef Taco voted as a top dish from AZCentral's Dominic Armato. Plus all its history here in the Valley going back to when it opened in 1992. The restaurant is located within the Melrose district (after a couple relocations). The decor pays homage to Native American culture with plenty of pictures and a Man in the Maze motif standing in place of a welcome mat. The roped off line to the ordering area at first confused me but I eventually caught on. There was a good mixed crowd here and plenty of regulars. Even though I already had my mind set on the taco, the Chumuth Burro, the Red Chili stew and the Hominy stew with plain fry bread called out to me from the menu on the wall as I waited. Service was quick and easy and they really try to move the line. The green chili taco was a lot bigger than I thought. I'm not going to lie, it was also a bit sloppy to eat. But when you stuff a fry bread with all that yummy gooey goodness it's probably not going to hold together for long. The fry bread is light and crisp and folded into a taco shape. The chili beef was nice and tender with cheese and the perfect amount of spiciness for me. It was a pretty good meal for $9 and good first experience for me. I'm dying to try that stew next time around. I'm also looking forward to introducing some of my Native buddies to this place.",

Prices are very reasonable, but be prepared to wait if the line is out the door. Seating is very limited, so if you have a big party you'll have to keep that in mind.

    "text": "This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix - great food, huge portions and inexpensive...can you really ask for anything more?  On my most recent visit I had Red Beef Chile over Fry Bread and Hominy Stew with Fry Bread.    The Red Beef Chile was savory, spicy and seasoned to near perfection.   It had just the right amount of liquid so that it didn't fall through the fry beard, but still retained the right amount of moisture.  My recommendation is to eat this thing fairly quickly and not to nurse this plate...eventually you'll see the beef fat harden and it's something you really want to ignore when you're enjoying such a great meal.  The Hominy Stew was really good.  Usually posole or hominy stews have chile added, which is great, but it was so interesting to get a stew that didn't have that, but still had a ton of flavor.  They didn't skimp on the beef, which is something you'd expect from other places.  The side of fry bread was perfect with the stew and added a bit of substance and heartiness to a great dish.   I hadn't been there in probably 8 years so it was nice to go back and see the food hadn't changed - actually it was better since there are more options and the decor is nicer (and I think they moved too?).    This is definitely a place to eat great food if you're visiting or living in Phoenix!",

    "text": "I enjoyed the Fry Bread as the bread itself was very delicious especially when topped with beans and cheese with the bread being an above average size.  Prices have gone up as a Fry Bread with bean and cheese will run you $6.28 after taxes and if you want to add a drink to that you can count on at least another $2.00.  For me the price isn't worth coming back on a regular basis.  The beans didn't have much taste but you can add salt and salsa to your bread if you want to add more taste.  Overall, if you are in the mood for some fry bread this is a good place to get a quick fix.  Although, I would have to say that the fry bread sold annually at the State Fair taste much better.  Special note, they have a child's size fry bread with bean and cheese with a drink for $3.95 plus tax.  Interestingly, the child's size is not too much smaller than the full size.    So if you want to save some $$$ you can always order take out and get the child's size fry bread !",

    "text": "I read about this place in a guide book before I traveled to Phoenix. The description was interesting enough to make me want to try it, and sure enough, I made my way to The Fry Bread House not really sure what to expect from my first fry bread taco.   Plenty of parking in the lot, not a big parking lot by any means, but I was able to grab a spot. Although I can imagine the parking headaches that one must endure during busier hours.   We arrived at about 5:30PM on a Tuesday night and there were plenty of other people and families enjoying their dinner in this tiny place. This is a seat-yourself type of restaurant, so don't expect much from the service. Plenty of booths and a few stand alone tables. The ordering process here is easy: you simply walk up to the counter, tell the cashier what you want, leave your name, find yourself a seat, and they call out your name when the food is ready.   Everything on the menu was intriguing, with a wide variety of fry bread tacos and a dessert menu that really looked quite appetizing. Unfortunately for us, we were so full from the enormous portions, there was no room for it. We would have loved to try the chocolate and butter or golden honey fry bread. Next time!   For an appetizer, we ordered the cheese crisps, which is basically a large baked tortilla with melted cheese on it. This dish was just okay. Not really what I was expecting, but still delicious and cheesy. Add a little bit of hot sauce for a tasty kick. For dinner, we stuck with the fry bread tacos. I ordered an indian taco and my girlfriend ordered the vegetarian taco. Both of them were awesome! The indian taco consists of refried beans, cheese and lettuce wrapped in deliciously fluffy fry bread. The vegetarian taco is basically the same thing except it also comes with onions, sour cream, and green chilies. Since this was our first trip here, we were not prepared for the massive size of these tacos. They actually look like small babies wrapped in diapers.   Overall, a great place if you are a traveler looking for something different that you won't find at home, and an awesome place for the locals to enjoy great Native American cuisine. I hope they don't take it for granted!",

We knocked until the person at the cash registered allowed us to come in.   Surprisingly, all of the credit card transactions and the cash register closes exactly at 7pm. Must be a systems thing. The store worker said that the dinner would be on the house. NO WAY!! He was so generous letting us order past the closing time. We definitely paid $15 in cash for our order.  The food was pretty tasty!! I wish we could have eaten the fry bread fresh, but we had to rush to the airport.   We ordered: + Green chili taco- with lettuce, chunks of beef, and cheese. Pretty good meaty flavor, and a bit messy to eat. I probably used 10 napkins.  + Vegetarian taco- with refried pinto beans, lettuce, sour cream, and cheese. I couldn't taste the beans as the sour cream masked the flavor.  + Honey bread dessert- Basically a flat fry bread and you pour the honey. Simple concept, but the bread was delicious!  The fry bread is so light and a HUGE size. I had enough carbs for the night.  Definitely get to this restaurant before it closes at 7pm!!!",

One thing you must understand about FBH is that they are control freaks! Posted on the outside window is a hand-written note explaining their open/close times, last pick up times, last call in times, etc.. Inside, there is a system of Ropes (capitalized on purpose) that supposedly helps the great multitudes of people line-up more orderly and efficiently. With the Ropes comes a posted, one-page memo explaining how the Ropes work, what's tolerated (and not) with the Ropes, and how to treat the Ropes. Someone has a rope fetish. Ridiculous. They also control the soda machine. They hide it behind some cheesy cloth barrier and make you ask for a refill like some child in an orphanage (\"please sir, may I have another.?). And they only allow ONE refill. Childish and overbearing. They are not overly friendly and charge you for everything. The food is tasty, but average and the plates are too small. Hey, we all like fry bread, but nothing special here. These guys are the Fry Bread Nazis. Wait for the Fair..",

The spacious new digs are a big improvement over the moderately squeezed 7th avenue spot, especially the parking.  Although I went in for a take-out order, I could appreciate the huge dining room where you wouldn't have to sit right on top of somebody.  If you go there for anything else than the food you might find it a little 'sterile', but of course the food is everything.    I was greeted by a cashier, she was exceptionally nice and made me feel welcome.  Opting for my favorite, I ordered the bean (whole bean) and cheese fry bread.  My order was ready in about 10 minutes and I headed for home (7 miles) where I found the meal was still hot.    FBH knows how to cook beans; they are the best in the city and prepared to perfection.  They don't skimp, the cheese is the real deal and the fry bread is divinity - as advertised.  Add-in their supplied homemade hot sauce and you've got a delicious 'homemade' meal.  The only thing I could compare it to was a favorite meal my mother used to make many years ago - cornbread and beans.  This Indian-style version of that meal certainly tastes homemade to me.    Let's hope the expanded version of FBH brings them much success.  For the uniqueness and quality of their food at bargain prices - they've earned it.  FBH is scheduled to move once again to the southeast corner of 7th Avenue and Hazelwood, about 5 blocks south of Camelback.",

    "text": "When a friend asked me to meet them for lunch and eat some fry bread, I immediately thought ~ \"is the fair or a carnival in town?\"  No, this is not your carnie type of fry bread, it much better!!  We met at The Fry Bread House and found it to be this little gem of a place that's kind of a hole in the wall.  You must look for the street sign to find them because they are set back off the road and since this is a small place they are kind of hard to find.  Their parking lot is usually full so you may want to park around the side.  Restaurant ~ nothing fancy here but it's very cleaned and kind of 70's dinerish. You walk in and step up to the counter and place your order. There are a lot of regular's and locals that dine here, so don't be afraid to ask one of them about your choices.  Service ~ friendly bunch of folks working here.  Everything is pretty much self-serv.  They are not very green friendly and use lots of plastic and stryo foam.  Food ~ The fry bread and red chili beef stew was very good and I would get it again.  The red chili stew was pipping hot with a very good balance of seasoning that wasn't too spicy and it had a good balance of meat to broth.  The fry bread was a little sweet, very tasty but it was a little too greasy. I know it's fry bread but I thought it would be a little more crispy.  We also had their tacos with beef and a veggie taco.  Both were very good however I should have eaten the taco first before my stew because the meat, beens and yummy goodness inside the taco was too much for the fry bread to hold up to.  It fell apart when trying to pick it up.    All in all it was a very good experience and I'm looking forward to going back to The Fry Bread House to try an opened faced taco, their green chili stew and some fry bread desert!  Oh my!",

    "text": "Of course it's delicious. It's fry bread! Way better here than at the fairgrounds. The location is small and quaint. The set up is awkward though, as you walk directly in there is a high counter where you place your order. There aren't any signs with the different types of fry bread they offer. Instead, a couple of menus on the cluttered counter top and  grumpy large man behind the counter.   When ordering, we said \"We're going to have 2-the bean/cheese and the honey/ powdered sugar, please.\" Mr. Grumpy didn't say a word as he poked at the register. He spit out our total, around $17, while walking to the back to place the order. When he returned I said \"$17 seems like a lot, is that right?\" He looked at me like I was a total moron and said \"Yeah..it IS right. You got two beans/cheese and two honey/sugar!\" Correcting him I said \"Oh, no. We wanted just one of each, please.\" He actually rolled his eyes at me and went in the back and angrily crossed off an order on the paper he had just delivered. Shocked by the horrible customer service I said, \"sorry for the confusion\". He looked at me, clearly annoyed - how dare I not order properly - and just said my new total. Yikes!  The food came quickly. The beans were average, not too flavorful and the cheese plentiful. The red bottles the tables with salsa of some sort wasnt too bad. The desert fry bread was much more tasty. Perfectly crisp, I'm going to try the one with butter next time! Yum!  I would've given this place 5 stars if the set-up was better (would love a clearly labeled menu in plain sight) and the awful customer service (Mr. Grumps). In a small, family owned restaraunt-word of mouth is your only chance at repeat and new customers. After reading other reviews, I'm not the only one to have had this same experience.   I'll be back...but hopefully someone else will be working the front counter.",

    "text": "Today I took a trip to The Fry Bread House for my first taste of the famous bread.  Until just a few days back I had thought fry bread was a desert much like an elephant ear or funnel cake.  I had no idea it was used as the base for a meal (they do offer desert varieties too).  For lunch I had an Indian Taco with green chili beef, beans, cheese and the normal taco fixings only it was served on fry bread as opposed to a tortilla. The taco was tasty and the portion was large.  I paid $5 or $6 and it was well worth it.  Just think about the money that can be spent at any fast food joint and the Indian Taco becomes an even better deal.  Service was easy and fast.  I ordered, picked up my drink, grabbed a paper towel and sat down.  By the time I checked in my name was called and my taco was waiting.    I was very impressed with The Fry Bread House and I will be returning.",

It is mosy definitely good, greasy, junk food.  In oh so glorious fry bread.  Some of their items are a little pricey, the honey and sugar fry bread, for one, but it sounds and tastes so good, you suck it up and order it anyway.  The flavors are overflowing, both figuratively and literally as the tacos mostly fall apart the second you try to pick it up.  They do provide a fork and knife to help with this, but don't do that, use your fry bread and scoop everything right up even if it makes your taco fall apart again.  My only little gripe is that although I taste the meat, the texture of it reminds me of refried beans.  Still good, nonetheless, and I'll definitely be back.",

Last time I went with three guest one of whom was blind with a cane. For some reason that restaurant has weird ropes in weird places which is a tripping hazard to the blind. The second reason is that after placing an order for three adult meals I also requested a small kids dessert, only to be told that I couldn't have it because I wasn't a kid.  If I was just placing an order for kids items I could better understand it. But being told that an adult can't order a small portion was just stupid to me.  Now I usually only go because others like it.  I can make fry bread  at home.",

The aroma that filled my car was mouthwatering. The taste- even better! The portions are massive, and I ended up eating leftovers twice from it. I wish I lived close by.

The beef was wonderful and a little bite to iy. Dip your fry bread and you would be in heaven. My guest also really enjoyed her vegetable stew which she commented was very flavorable.  My only complaint would be the quantity which could be more for the price.  I felt like the bowl and quantity were too small. Maybe because it tasted so good.

    "text": "This is out of love i write this review, I have been going for ages to this place, since they moved back to 7th ave again they changed the hot sauce flavor. I asked and they said it was a change from powder to real garlic. This doesnt sound like anything right?   The problem is it ruined the flavor. I bought like 4 things and smothered it with the sauce that I always loved and it ruined it all. There is a weird taste to it which makes me want to vomit when smelling it now. You can ask for other ok salsa they have, but if anyone is like me or my wife and never knew how it tasted before I am pretty sure you will have a ton of one time customers. It has a fish smell to it now. At first I thought it was the oil they fried the stuff in but then asked the staff and found out what changed. I know it doesnt make sense but it ruined like 45$ worth of food. If you plan to eat here sample the sauce first or smell it, one of my friends said he couldnt tell but we havent been back in months so he isnt chomping at the bit to go back when it was a weekly thing. The food is still great just dont ruin it with the hot sauce.   I will take this review down if they tell me they changed it back or wont ever change it back but anyone trying out the food for the first time, it wasnt like this before. The sauce added to the food, the food was epic, now you might accidentally ruin it if you dont know and try the hot sauce now.  update 3/20/2018:  they changed their salsa taste on my last visit with my wife, we were both happy about it. They really need to figure out their weird soda fountain rules though, hence one missing star.",

My fry bread was FRESH not greasy and bigger than my face. I got the vegetarian taco which came with hatch chili -it was a little hotter than I like but not overwhelming. The lettuce was green and cheese didn't taste low grade aka imitation cheese or a \"cheese like product\". But next time I will probably get the regular taco because of spice.

It is complete heaven: humongous frybread, slathered with beans, meat or vegetables, cheese, and huge sodas. Lunch time it is PACKED, but after hours it is always calm and relaxing. The food is prepared quickly and they never miss a beat.  *Conan and Andy advertised it for their live show* This demonstrates the pure power of the Fry Bread House.",

As well, they have a salsa which is mild but flavorful.  I have taken friends and family to this place and they have all loved it.  You can't beat the pricing which is very reasonable for the quality of the food.  Everyone in the place is nice and helpful.  The building is small and pushed back from the street.  I always pass it and have to make a u-turn to get there.  The only negative is the dining area is small and sometimes really packed (but any good place would be packed).  Luckily I have always found a empty booth or table.  Also, what is cool is that  sometimes they do have someone selling Native American Jewelry outside.  I can't speak more highly of the place.  Give it a chance and I am positive you will be back to the place.",

    "text": "Made to order fry bread with all sorts of toppings (reminiscent of Mexican food). The bread is deep fried, of course, but it wasn't dripping with oil. Instead it was light, airy and fluffy. As you order you can see the kitchen, they were making refried beans, red chili sauce, fry bread, and soup from scratch. Not a canned food in sight! Some home cooking going on here so its got favor.   I had their ultimate with beef, lettuce, cheese, beans and sour cream - making my mouth water right now. It was about $8.50 and was so big! An even amount of each ingredient layered on top of the fry bread and folded in half. Good mix of flavors. If you go, go with an empty stomach or after you worked out :)   I dig it when I go to a local business that serves good food. People were nice and the place was very clean. Not that much seating though and its busy at lunch time.   I was so stuffed after my meal but I couldn't stop... I ordered the fry bread with powdered sugar and honey. Oh man. Yum.",

Today's experience was awful, though. They must have left the recipe back at the old joint (lol). Today I got the hominy stew with a plain fry bread on the side. Usually this stew is absolutely delicious. The meat has always been very tender and flavorful. Today, the meat was very tough and hard.  The stew had no flavor, whatsoever. It was very bland. Just nasty.The fry bread didn't even taste good. It was VERY greasy. I was not impressed at all with my visit. My husband also said that he visited a couple of weeks ago as well and also noticed that the food wasn't as good as it usally is. I don't know, maybe they need some time to get back into the groove of things but I definitely won't be going back for a while.",

There are probably 25-30 seats available in the restaurant itself.  Looks like there are quite a few people who order to-go.  I had the regular old green chili fry bread taco - it came with beef in a sauce, lettuce, and shredded cheddar cheese on top on a deep fried bread.  It was very good.  The beef was tender and not chewy or rubbery at all.  Good thing they give you a fork and knife because I don't think it's possible to eat the taco without it falling apart with the sauce.  I probably took a year off my life with all that grease, cholesterol, and fat, but it was definitely work it. I would come back here if I'm ever in the area again.",

    "text": "First ever experience with Indian food and definitely NOT a fan.  Exterior definitely looked like a house as their name calls for. A tad bit worn both interior and exterior. Furnitures were simply cafeteria like tables and you order at the counter paying upfront.  Their # 1 rave after hominy stew was a must try so I did so and for sure there will be a no second time. Blindfold me and I would've never been able to tell if this was homemade or out of a Progress/Campbells can. Stew definitely had sufficient ingredient but simply lacks flavor. Abundant amount of hominy in every spoon but does not suit my palate at all. Protein was tough and soup tasted run down.   Fried bread reminds me of chinese donuts served for breakfast except a tad bit more doughy and is flattened to a circular shape. The bread itself is a great foundation for both entree and dessert if all ingredients were done right. I ordered a taco and a dessert (all utilizes fried bread) and was devasted with the ingredient used. The chocolate butter dessert was simply a cup full of butter poured over a cup of chocolate syrup. NOt to mention that the bread was already deep fried. Enough grease where a pack of oil absorbant sheet can't even save. Flavor was just like how it sounded.   Taco itself was ground meat, refried bean, lettuce and cheese. Definitely tasted like something you can get at a taco bell/ Del Taco. No special marination nor seasoning done.   I guess if i'm ever craving fried bread itself and if I\"m by the area..which will never be..I'd probably pick one up and slap something on there myself. However it wasn't all that unique to me since Chinese cuisine carries close to identical \"fried bread' they make.  Plentiful parking. Poor service since I was turned down for needing an extra set of utensils.  -Susan",

    "text": "In 2012, The Fry Bread House garnered a rare honor.  A coveted James Beard Award.  Founded by Cecilia Miller in 1992, this Tohono O'odham Nation inspired restaurant was given an American Classics Award by the Beard Foundation.  If my memory serves me correctly, I believe that was two locations ago.  I can't say for certain, largely because The Fry Bread House has moved around a lot over the last couple of years.  First they were in the Melrose District, then they moved east to the Coronado District.  Now they're back in Melrose and have stood still long enough for me to finally come by and get a meal.  On a Thursday around dinner, it was fry bread time.  You'll find The Fry Bread House's current (and hopefully permanent) location on the southeast corner of 7th Avenue and Hazelwood (midway between Camelback and Indian School).  Inside, the restaurant can pretty snuggly sit around 50-60 patrons max.  Unsurprisingly you'll see plenty of Native American art, photos, and other symbols adorning the walls of this valley staple.  You order at the register here (and negotiate a somewhat odd triangular metal frame used to form the customer line) and they bring the food and drink out to you.  I've had my fair share of fry bread in my time.  But for me fry bread was always more of a fair food.  I'd had various iterations at the Arizona State Fair growing up and even at county fairs around the state.  In fact I've only had fry bread once in a restaurant setting prior to this (a dessert fry bread at a Mexican restaurant in Flagstaff in case you're curious).  Here at Fry Bread House it's available both as a dessert and as the main entree itself.  The menu here decidedly tilts along the lines of traditional Sonoran Mexican food, but with Native American influences.  So for those dining here for the first time, much of the menu options will look familiar to longtime valley connoisseurs of Mexican food.  For my first go around, I ordered as follows:  A fountain drink, a Ground Beef Combination Fry Bread Taco, and a Chocolate & Butter Sweet Fry Bread.  Total cost for all of this including tax came to $20.  Let's first discuss the Combo.  Ground beef, refried pinto beans, lettuce and shredded cheese.  Sounds familiar right?  Now put all that on a piece of warm pillowy soft fry bread that's twice the size of your average dinner plate.  Think I'm exaggerating?  Look at my photo.  Or better yet make the same mistake that I did and try to eat this taco with your hands.  You will fail as hilariously as I did.  This thing is genuinely huge but the fry bread largely works well here as a vehicle for all those dairy and veggie toppings.  While the fry bread is solid, honestly the taco otherwise tasted like...well...a taco.  Just in gargantuan form.  As for the Chocolate & Butter Sweet Fry Bread?  Same size fry bread as my taco, but this one is carved up in pizza form and covered in warm milk chocolate and lots of warm butter.  They brag that this has been an award winner for them.  If you've ever had a sweet sopaipilla before, this will probably remind you of it's sweetness and crispiness (albeit slightly more oily).  I liked this dessert for the most part.  It's not especially hearty, but rather a light and airy dessert that can easily be devoured by yourself despite the enormous size of the bread.  All things considered I would say my first meal here was okay.  The taco and dessert were decent and in each case the bread stood out as the most noticeable and well made component.  Though I will say the rest of the presentation in each case was somewhat bland to me.  I trust that Cecilia and her staff are largely sticking to their traditional roots with their menu, and good for them for doing so.  I suppose all those years of fry bread at fairs and the variety of Mexican food at my disposal have me yearning for something a little more bold than what Fry Bread House's menu offers.  Nevertheless I embrace fry bread's place in our culinary history and applaud Fry Bread House and other fry bread proprietors for keeping the tradition alive.  Whether bolder iterations of this bread will evolve beyond the fair circuit?  Your guess is as good as mine.",

They're huge!! I got the deluxe and we sat in chairs outside while ate - there are no tables outside, only a few chairs. We finished eating before the last dining room customers finished eating and throughly cleaned up after ourselves so I didn't feel guilty eating curb side.",

A little history, this restaurant has been an urban native staple for years.  It has changed location a few times.  The newest location is sized well,  not tiny like the first restaurant and not so huge like the old Panchos location.   I used to break a mild sweat with the red chili and the frybread was fluffy.  The menu options have increased,  there are tamales,  chumuth (Pima tortillas), dessert frybreads, $10! Frybread burgers and stews.  Might be nice to see the food go back to basics.  In a nutshell, I felt it was a bit over priced.   Good to see Native Artwork is still supported.",

The meat in the red chili taco was super reddish pink which was really wierd, and it had no taste. It also left me feeling sick for much of the day. I decided to give the combination taco a try the next day, just in case the food was not the issue. Well with the combination taco, the problem was the same. The taco actually tasted as if it had chemicals in it. I ate a corner of the taco, and threw it in the trash. So much for the 20 something dollars that I spent. I'm very disappointed with this restaurant. This restaurant used to be good, but the food in this new location is trash.",

When the second one came out the meat and beans on it were barely there. I gave up. Only giving two stars because my daughters food came out hot. What happened to this place?

At least that's what my sister almost did -- what would I have done if the fry bread fell to the ground? :( Probably eat it off the ground!   So I took a bite into this. My first reaction: Why is this salty? So I was thrown off by the saltiness of it. Some people might think the chocolate and salt compliment each other but I didn't feel it. I love the chocolate on it.   When you're on a diet, never go to any fry bread house. There's swarms of oil dripping from the fry bread.   And please share it with your guest. Do not eat one by yourself.   Overall, it's decent but I wasn't the biggest fan because I didn't like the saltiness of it. (I love chocolate though!)",

A James Beard award winner for local fare, The Fry Bread House is great!  Big taco like creations with their amazing fry bread. The green chili sauce is outstanding. You also need to make room in your belly for their dessert. It's chocolate sauce on their fry bread. Amazingly simple and extremely addictive. My hands looked like a fight scene from The Matrix as to how fast I ate it!  Parking lot is super tiny and I heard the lunch crowd is huge (not large in weight just lots of people).",

One green chili and one red chili frybread were ordered and took about 10 minutes to receive. I really like the new location and the interior, very comfortable so that the wait wasn't overly intolerable. The staff were very friendly. The frybread itself is absolutely delicious- not greasy and just the right amount of fluffy.  However, for the price they charge for each one I would have preferred more chili filling; it seemed a little stingy, so one star deducted.  The green chili frybread is highly recommended, just the right amount of spice...without a doubt I'll be back to order that one again.  (The red chili is good too, just not as good as that green chili goodness).",

Service was friendly and pretty quick with our orders. The ultimate taco with green chili sauce was sooo good. The bread was tasty- fried perfectly and was such a large portion. Try the ground beef taco as well, if you're not into saucy. The hominy stew was good- simple but flavorful. Sodas come with free refills. (wish I noticed the sign before ordering a 'Large') Their large is HUGE and comparable to a 2 person family sized portion? Lol I don't know how to describe it but large was definitely an understatement.   The food here definitely hit the spot and the next time I'm in Phoenix, I will HAVE to stop by!",

I'm so happy that this full service restaurant exists and that I don't have to go to a stand on a dirt road alongside an Indian tourist attraction to indulge in my fry bread cravings.   This is a big open restaurant. Service is a bit slow but very kind and friendly. It's definitely a family run operation.   Alongside their fry bead they also have an American Indian style flour tortilla type bread that they had as a special wrapped around hot dogs. Very unique.   Green chile. Red chile stews with hominy. Delicious tacos made with the fry bread as a shell. One taco is a pretty substantial order.   Dessert also features the frybread. You can have it simply dusted with powdered sugar or drizzles with honey and melted butter among many other creative combinations.   Ahh the versatile and delicious Indian fry bread.",

But the quality in the flavor was definitely not there.  the mesa establishment had. Flavor chunks of meat and quality tasting chille. I felt like I ordered a red chili soup in my fry bread very runny hardly any meat and the red chili sauce honestly tasted like store bought red chili tamales. The bread itself was very good but the red chillies suck. I mean it tasted like can sauce. I mean is money that tight you can't make homemade chili sauce? Cuz Homemade should never taste like store bought. Either way I don't see myself ever coming back. 38$ for store bought red chille. Smh",

    "text": "Moving finally to the last of my supplementary snacks I'll start off by saying I'd read about The Fry Bread House a couple of times when planning my trip to The Valley but it did not make my list of must visit stops until just the day prior during dinner at Kai when I was speaking with head Chef Michael O'Dowd about the lack of Native American restaurants in the area (he explained this to me, but that is for another time) and one of his expeditors suggested I should check out Cecilia Miller's temple of fried dough calling it \"about as authentic as it gets around here.\"  Hailing from the Tohono O'odham Nation and serving up her style of Indian Tacos around the area for nearly twenty years (and now at two locations) I opted to head to the original Fry Bread House West and having followed my GPS from door to door I found the location with ease on a relatively dingy stretch of 7th Avenue and allocating parking with ease I made my way into the unassuming low-lying restaurant where I was greeted by a short line and then by a curt but friendly waitress who took no time in requesting my order and name before handing me a plastic cup to get my water and suggesting it would be perhaps 10 minutes before my food was ready.  Taking a seat - the table slightly sticky and clearly not wiped down since (at least) the last diners - and browsing the scene while I watched the kitchen work through the small open window I marveled at the flow of the room as patron after patron received his or her food.  With some orders having been phoned in and others being delivered to the tables surrounding mine if I had to guess nearly fifteen Fry Breads were served during my nine minute wait and when I finally heard \"Michael\" called from the front I stepped up to collect my $12 merely seconds before the next order was served up to \"Andre.\"  Returning to my seat with prizes in hand my first impression was that I'd over ordered as each disc was easily the size of a Frisbee and two-to-three fold as thick, but picking up my first option, the \"Indian Taco with Pinto Beans, Shredded Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce\" I was next impressed as to just how light the hand stretched bread was - a wisp of pillowy flat bread crisped on the outside by the oil but light and airy within.  With the ingredients a standard store-bought admixture of traditional taco toppings and a bit of hot sauce to taste this was a good choice to understand what the \"Indian Taco\" was all about (and perhaps to understand why diabetes and lipid disorders are so prevalent in their population, as well.)  Moving next to my dessert selection, one of the frequently noted \"best dishes\" in Phoenix and denoted as an \"Award Winning Favorite\" on the restaurant menu, the Chocolate and Butter Fry Bread would prove to be every bit the \"Fair Food\" extravagance I expected with the same airy dough this time served openfaced and drizzled - nay - ladled first with butter and then with melted dark chocolate tinged with what I believe was adobe spice and cinnamon.  Sliced and resting atop both wax paper and napkins to soak up the grease I attacked this fry bread with zeal and without going so far as to call it the most sinful thing I've eaten this year I will simply say this; it was a once-in-a-year sort of treat that was entirely worth the money, calories, and visit but at the same time the sort of thing that simply feels \"bad\" for you despite the smile on your face as you're eating it.",

I ordered almost exactly what he ordered, it sounded so good.  And it was!  I don't think I've had better hominy stew. And this was my first time eating anything quite like the fry bread with red chile. I probably made a big mistake ordering so much, but I didn't have any idea there might be a half pound of meat in there. The cooking is high quality, the experience definitely original, and the atmosphere is very comforting, being in a remodeled house.  Alas, there is a downside. I generally have a strong constitution. I eat street food in Mexico as often as I can get there, and usually with no ill effects. But the Ethier special had me reeling. Not in the many-unscheduled-bathroom-trips kind of way, but I felt bad and was belching uncontrollably for about the next 24 hours.  I really like the Fry Bread House.  I'm just not sure it likes me.",

The Fry Bread House sounded amazing! I read a couple reviews that said the man behind the counter was rude, but I pretty much overlooked them. That was a huge mistake, because I received the absolute WORST customer service I ever have in my life.   We went up to order and the man behind the counter did not smile, did not greet us, did not ask if we had any questions, NOTHING. My mom and I ordered the red and green chile tacos respectively and my boyfriend ordered the taco with ground beef. I have to say that my mom and I did like our food, but it wasn't enough to keep me from despising this place. My boyfriend is not fan of vegetables, onions, or anything really other than meat. He specifically ordered it because on the menu, \"ONLY these ingredients\" (ground beef) is underlined and it says 'without all the extra stuff' or something like that. It sounded perfect to him!   We sit down to eat our food and he finds that there are many diced onions all over the ground beef. We both go up to the counter and tell him that my boyfriend is allergic to onions and he ordered it specifically because of the verbiage on the menu. He did not say anything; he just went looking through the menu to try to prove us wrong. I said \"I didn't read it, but my boyfriend did.\" He laughed, did not look at us and said \"That's right, he didn't read it!\" in an extremely offensive manner. He is still looking through the menu still and after a while he cannot find anything to prove us wrong! He offers my boyfriend fry bread with beans. We ask if there is a way we can get the ground beef with no onions, and he very rudely said \"If you wanna wait an hour!\" My boyfriend tells him to just make it with cheese thinking it will be somewhat like a quesadilla. The man behind the counter throws his old food away right in front us angrily, and then he tells his employee something. He comes back with fry bread sprinkled with shredded cheese! It's not melted or anything! How is this an equivalent meal? He also gives me about 2.50 back. Of course, it was terrible food. Who would want to eat that?   My boyfriend was still hungry and I was sick of going up to the counter. It was the worst experience I've ever had at any establishment. Good food will only get you so far, Fry Bread House. We will never be back again and it looks like you're starting to put off a lot of people. You better change or else you will go under faster than you can sprinkle shredded cheese.",

I'm so glad we came here.  We had the shreaded hatch red chile beef combo taco, it was AWESOME!  We also shared an order of the green chile stew, again great and we shared the cinnamon sugar fry bread for dessert.  All was great, the three of us were stuffed and all for $30.  If you like spicy, if you like new mexican and american indian food you will love this place.  Try it out if you are ever in the Phoenix area.",

    "text": "This is simple food. Simple, unhealthy ingredients, presented in utilitarian environs.  I had hominy stew and it tasted fine in a Progresso soup kind of way,  but I guess my real disconnect with The Fry Bread House  is I didnt encounter anything remotely interesting - unless you count morbidly obese people on either side of the counter. Maybe I didnt look hard enough.    I guess for me, the joy of visiting an ethnic place is sampling a bit of the culture gastronomically and through the restaurant's atmosphere - and there doesnt seem to be much joy here. I wont say there's no pride. There's just very little imagination or pizzazz. Maybe it's a traditional culture thing, but I find it kinda sad.   The menu is very redundant. Decor is charmless. Service is not  bad but perfunctory.  The stew was too thin to really slather on my fry bread, and I'm quite certain no one here is concerned about any of it. .   It presents an interesting contrast with a place like LoLo's. Inexpensive ethnic. Limited, unhealthy menu. Plenty of fat people. Sure, the food's better at Lolo's, but it's deeper than that.  There's an attitude, a pride, an eagerness to show off their skillz that's somehow uplifting and fun, whereas The Fry Bread House comes across, to me anyway, as nondescript and depressing.",

I find that their fry bread here is thicker and crispier than that of Sacred Hogan and they salt their food well (to the point I didn't have to add any, and I think I have a salty palate). Sacred Hogan is not as generous with their salt (can be good and bad).   My mom had the beef stew and I had the combo indian taco with red chile.  I can say that I would go back just for a bowl of their red chile beef,  and has me curious about their green chile, after having it on my taco (this coming from a Native New Mexico girl who knows her chile) .  It was not spicy but full of flavor.  My mom's beef stew was hearty and served with a good sized piece of fry bread and was quite tasty.   We left stuffed and didn't eat another meal that day.    I will still find myself going to Sacred Hogan for their Lamb Sandwich, or their Mutton Stew but you may find me mixing in a little FBH now and again.",

    "text": "As a fry bread \"noob,\" I'll err on the side of caution and chalk most of my dislikes up to unfamiliar, lest I make anybody angry by sullying what seems to be somewhat of a Phoenix institution.  Still, I will say that I was not absolutely astounded by the food or the prices, both of which most reviewers have raved about.  Fry bread itself is something akin to a fluffier fried version of Indian naan, and can be ordered with a wide variety of savory or sweet toppings. I had the chili combination taco with green chili sauce, and while it was good, it was nothing spectacular -- I've had mexican dishes with more interesting flavor.  Still, the fry bread itself was fluffy and delicious. When I saw menudo -- beef tripe stew -- listed on the menu, I decided I should definitely give it a try, having never eaten tripe before.  The tripe was a lot less chewy that I was expecting, and a good contrast to the almost crunchiness of the hominy, but the stew as a whole was largely flavorless, and just plain salty. I would definitely give this place another go, and try the sweet fry breads, I saw a couple get one for desert and it looked awesome.",

    "text": "3.5- This is one of those places that I would be happy going to once every couple of years or so. While I liked the food, it's not something that I see myself craving on a constant basis. The fry bread itself was fresh, chewy and tasted eerily similar to a traditional Chinese breakfast staple called  called \"You Tiao,\" which is a fried bread in the shape of a stick, rather than the round shape of the Native American \"fry bread\" served at The Fry Bread House.   We tried 2 varieties of the fry bread tacos as well as a sweet fry bread while we stopped here during our roadtrip to the Southwest: chorizo taco, ultimate combo taco and fry bread w/ honey. Again, no complaints about the bread really, but the fillings actually kind of took away from the tastiness of the fry bread. The chorizo was the better of the two \"tacos.\" The meat was spicy and abundant. However, the ultimate combo taco filling was a let-down. There was hardly any beef-- there was way too much refried beans, and it just did not pair well with the fry bread. The sogginess of the filling weighed the bread down.   The sweet fry bread was very tasty and dripping with honey. However, I was feeling really bloated by the time I got to this portion of the meal-- you see, whatever fry bread I consumed seemed to have expanded at least 3 times in my stomach...  So overall, worth a stop for the curiosity factor. But now I know if I ever wanted to eat Native American \"fry bread\" again, I can just buy some You Tiao from the local Asian grocery and experience pretty much the same taste again.",

    "text": "Here is the paradox of the Fry Bread House. You want to eat your fry bread while it's sizzling hot and freshly puffed, at which point it is light, airy, and gently crisp -- a superlative fry bread that leaves many other fry breads deflated with shame at not measuring up to its texture. At the same time, eating in is likely to harsh your buzz, as the restaurant has the eerie dive-iness of a place that's kept scrupulously clean but that's too big to be properly lit and decorated on the available budget.  My suggestion would be to stop by before a show at the nearby Rhythm Room, get your fry bread \"to go,\" hustle back to the venue at top speed, and eat your piping hot fry bread on the picnic tables before the doors open.   I ordered mine with beans and cheese, and these are fine beans. Now I'm torn between wanting another savory round with many things heaped on it (bring on the chorizo!) and wanting to try 'em with sweet toppings.",

There are other menu items but this is what we came for and what the place is named for and it did not disappoint.  I would have been happy with a bowl of either the red or green chile beef on its own, but served on top of the crispy-tender fry bread and topped with creamy shredded cheese and crisp lettuce - the whole thing was great.  It wasn't easy to pick up and eat like a taco so I used fork and knife.  Definitely worth the drive across town. Order at the counter and they bring it to your table. About $10 for a fry bread with red or green chile beef.  They also have sweet/dessert fry breads, tamales, etc. but we were pretty full from our chile beef fry breads.  If we're back in Phoenix (were in town from Virginia) we would try to visit again.",

    "text": "There are hardly words to describe the deliciousness of this restaurant.   I have heard about the Fry Bread House, as most of us probably have, because this little local restaurant has won a James Beard award which is.... odd. Usually the words 'James Beard' evoke imagery of white tablecloths, waiters with the contraptions to clean crumbs from the table, ridiculous numbers of forks for various purposes..... well, this isn't that place (at all). This restaurant is (temporarily) located in the old Pancho's buffet, which, as you know, was a very classy establishment (heh). They did pretty much nothing to make the space their own.... The buffet area is sectioned off with a sheet hanging from the ceiling, some of the extra rooms house other businesses (Native American art anyone?), and the floors/walls/tiles/etc are all the same. This is understandable as they have announced that they are moving (again) to 7th ave and Camelback (ish) early next year.   Anyway.... the husband and I came here with the International Supper Club on Wednesday night. The clientele was eclectic to say the least, but that is part of the charm. They have the menu posted on the wall, you order at the counter, and they deliver your food to the table. We had the cheese crisp, the green chili combo taco, and the butter and chocolate fry bread to share. The cheese crisp is a waste of time... it isn't bad, but it isn't anything special.... definitely skip (especially for the price... 6$... almost as much as the tacos). The taco was... incredible. It was love at first bite. The green chili pork was slightly spicy, soft, and full of flavor. The beans were delicious (and I don't typically like refried beans at all). The combination of those with cheese, lettuce, and fry bread (and a little of their house hot sauce) was unlike anything I have ever put in my mouth. This cannot be compared to fry bread you get at the fair... this is so much better. I want another.... like right now.   So what could top the taco? The chocolate and butter fry bread, that's what. The husband was expecting Hershey's syrup.....this was about as far from Hershey's as you can get. Rich, melty, decadent chocolate oozed on top of hot fried dough complemented by melted butter made for one of the top desserts I have had in a long time. This thing is not healthy. I don't care. It was great.   Take home point: Go here. Close your eyes. Imagine the white tablecloths. Ignore the grungy location. Sink your teeth into some decadently unhealthy deliciousness and smile.",

Be prepared to get great customer service, incredible flavor, completely full, and to eat your taco with both hands or to attack it using your knife and fork! If you're looking for fancy, this isn't the place. The menu is on the wall, you order at the register, you take your number, grab your own drink and seat yourself. Located in the old Panchos building they're not about gorgeous decor it's all about great food. I came in with the International Supper Club, other wise I probably would have never discovered this diamond in the rough. I ordered the green chili taco, the fry bread was soft, the inside filled with spicy goodness that melted in your mouth. I wanted to order the dessert bread but 1 taco filled me up! I'll be back, I've already looked it up to see if I could race over on my lunch hour from Tempe. They're moving soon to the 7th ave  & Camelback area but either way it's definitely worth the drive!",

So I went on Yelp and found this place. This is your \"made with love\" kind of place. Feels like there's a grandma in the back making the food. It's just SO good. I had the fry bread with beef stew, and my boyfriend had the Ultimate Taco. Delicious. We ended up coming back the next day where he had the same thing and I tried the Hominy stew. It was my first time trying Hominy and I honestly wasn't a fan of it but the broth was still really good. I just liked the beef stew better. But the frybread! So good. If I had to describe the taste I'd best put it as a Zeppole and Naan bread had a baby.  The pricing is also great, about $8 for the stew and bread together which is very filling. About $3 for the bread alone. I later on stopped by a fair and saw them selling fry bread far more expensive, so get it here instead!",

How hard is it to neatly scoop some beans on a giant fry bread? The staff is rude. Condescending signs posted everywhere- as though they are talking to all their customers like children-\"don't touch the cups.\" \"Don't swing on the or even touch ropes\". No refills on sodas? Ice tea tastes like it's been sitting in the pot for a few days. Rancid. But that is free refills. Come on, their profit margins can't be that low? Seriously? Or how about $1.00 for a sprinkle of lettuce or a $1.50 for a sprinkle of tomatoes. I could buy a pound of tomatoes and a head of lettuce for that price. Seriously? 50 is plenty for those extra toppings. But don't bother, because if you get it to-go, you'll have to microwave it to avoid food poisoning. I called them to see if they will do anything about the cold food. They wanted me to bring the food back so they can \"look it over\". Not offering a solution we didn't bother and threw it in the trash. $26 down the drain. We won't be going back.  Maricopa County Health Department needs to do a surprise inspection here. I'm certain the food is NOT being kept at proper temperatures. Gross.",

As an LA native, fry bread tacos were unlike anything I ever had but also familiar, with delicious fillings that reminded me of the mexican food I grew up with, like chorizo and chile verde and awesome refried pinto beans.  but the chewy, crispy fry bread brought everything to a whole new level.  I'm kinda glad that we don't live nearby because, while delicious, I'm sure its totally artery-clogging.   Also not touristy at all, looks like a place frequented almost exclusively by locals.

My problem with this place was the decor, (or lack thereof) along with the \"old\" and dirty smell/feel of the dining room. Furniture that needed to be replaced long ago with ripped seats that are cheaply taped over, broken tables with hand written notes on them telling the customer \"DO NOT SIT HERE!\", very poor lighting, and just an overall \"dirty\" feel.  I thought I was eating in some third world bomb shelter or something.

    "text": "I love chewy flatbread and I love fried foods, so I knew I had to try fry bread while in Arizona. We decided to check out The Fry Bread House on a Saturday night before we headed to the Rockets game. There were people in the restaurant at 6pm, but we were able to order right away. We got:  -Ultimate Taco (Refried Beans w/Spicy Red Chili Beef, Diced Onions, Sour Cream, Shredded Cheese, Lettuce, $7.69, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-fry-bread-house-phoenix?select=w9ARHJ3G0GpgcvKd2eyGFA#w9ARHJ3G0GpgcvKd2eyGFA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>): Yum (I stole a bite of my friend's fry bread)! I really liked the spice in the red chili beef, and that the beef was really tender. The fry bread was perfectly cooked, and was crispy but still chewy. -Ultimate Taco (Refried Beans w/Green Chili Beef, Diced Onions, Sour Cream, Shredded Cheese, Lettuce, $7.69, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-fry-bread-house-phoenix?select=w9ARHJ3G0GpgcvKd2eyGFA#IGaxrR-YU3PsJ6IYjvRHnw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>): We got the refried beans on the side, and I was really happy we did that since the fry bread itself was really filling. I loved how puffy it was, and the green chili beef had really good flavor.  -Chocolate & Butter ($4.95, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-fry-bread-house-phoenix?select=w9ARHJ3G0GpgcvKd2eyGFA#IDu9jkqjvrKF6MlGhZKojA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>): SOOOO good- a must order if you enjoy sweets/dessert! This fry bread could have used a bit more chocolate, but I loved the combination of the chocolate and butter.   I really wish they let you do half and half of the red chili and green chili beef. I knew I wouldn't be able to eat an entire fry bread to myself since I also wanted to try a sweet one, so I had to make a decision to choose either the red or the green. I wouldn't mind paying an extra $0.50 or $1 to add the extra flavor, just because I know I won't get to come back for a while. I liked both the red and green chilis, but would probably choose the red over the green just because I like spicy food. I was super full after eating half the ultimate taco and 1/4 of the sweet fry bread; however, two of my friends were able to eat the entire ultimate taco on their own and eat some of the sweet fry bread. The restaurant itself is very hole in the wall-ish, and the building is definitely on the older side. The benches for the tables could have used some cleaning, and the lady taking our order could have been a little friendly, but oh well, have low expectations for that sort of thing when you dine here. Just come for the delicious, fatty, fry bread, and your tummy (and wallet) will be happy! Parking was easy in their lot, but I'm not sure where you would park if the lot was full.",

Only reason why I'm giving them 3 stars is because of the menu prices are deceiving they have not updated and when I mention it is she kind of just Shrugged and said that's what the prices are but don't let that discourage you from coming here and trying something very authentic kind of Indian & Mexican style menu that they have that guess they're catering to their customers but Indian bread and cooking is totally different from what they're actually providing.

I can buy two whole entire onions for that price.   I've came before and wasn't charged for onion, then came today and was told it was $1.50 extra, that's ridiculous.   I could see $1.50 for extra meat... BUT ONION!   Update: just got my order, and I'm pretty disappointed. I've been eating here since there previous location, and this is the first time I was given like a smear of beans. I paid 9$ for bread basically.   Get it together Fry Bread House.",

Coming in was a total relief, because the environment is friendly, warm, and the ease of ordering left me totally relaxed. And oh the FRY BREAD is the gloriously thin and chewy puffed-up dough that's been topped generously with beans, lettuce, and cheese (hello, Indian taco). They don't serve booze here, but being around boozed-up folks was exactly what I didn't need. The enormous taco ran me up a cool $7 USD. Great place with great affordable food.",

Don't forget to ask for salsa to spice it up! My friend prefers the green Chile taco but if you don't want fried bread, their menu has other options like burros, tamales, stews, etc...I cant speak about those items because I've never tried.

    "text": "I was first exposed to The Fry Bread House during their days operating on Indian School Road. They've since moved to 7th Avenue in the \"suicide lane\" area as I like to call it. I decided that it was time to pay them a long-overdue visit.  Now, one must keep in mind that I've always placed fry bread under the same umbrella as deep dish pizza. When done right, it's good, but it's something that I'd never be able to eat regularly. But occasionally, when the mood strikes to eat something incredibly unhealthy, but yet satisfyingly delicious, this is one of those places that pulls it off quite well.  At this point, I've only tried their red chili beef taco and haven't quite developed the courage to experiment further. The red chili beef is classified as hot, but by the standards of most, it's pretty mild. Ingredients are all good quality, with the fry bread itself being a notch above what you'd find at other places. It's fluffy, it's chewy, and it packs some solid flavor.  If your stomach can handle dessert, I've found that the chocolate and butter combo works well, although there's a variety of other dessert options to choose from if you're more into cinnamon-style. It's also surprisingly much lighter than you'd expect. I was able to finish both my taco and half of the dessert bread quite easily, which is something that I didn't expect to be able to do going in.  I've made a mental note that when I return, it's high time that I finally try the green chili that everyone mentions, to see whether or not I've been missing out.  Highly recommended!",

Beans were just right and why I say that is because if beans aren't cooked or seasoned the right way, it can make a huge difference.   Make sure to order a large drink of your choice because it isn't one of those self serve soda machines and they charge for refill.    Ordering food wasn't at my expectation, considering the employee wasn't very pleasant or friendly.   Now let's talk about the environment which caused me to rate this a 3. Environment is so important to me in a establishment, especially in a restaurant. As soon as we walked in, the employee was cleaning the restroom, mind you the restroom is right in the entrance, so as she is cleaning it, the whole restaurant smelled like cleaning chemicals which is very toxic for my food and the fact that I'm pregnant I wasn't to happy about the smell. It was very unsanitary and a wrong time to clean when the doors had just opened for business that day.  I'm sure the people felt the same way behind us in line.   So my experience was ok, but luckily the food was good.",

People get surprised when I tell them I don't really care for fry bread because I'm actually Native American and I always get \"what Native doesn't like fry bread?\"  I ended up ordering two tamales, one red and one green. I really enjoyed the red tamale and would definitely get it again, the green was too spicy for my liking. I love spicy but the green tamale was just too eye watering and tongue burning. My brother had a taste of the green tamale and said although it was really spicy, that it was good. My brother ended up getting a taco which was fry bread served with beans and ground beef on top, along with lettuce and cheese. I tried the taco and it was BOMB! I wish I would have gotten my own. It's a very good filling portion with very good flavor. For dessert we got fry bread with butter, powdered sugar, and cinnamon and that just made me love this spot more. I would recommend this place to everyone I know and would be back very soon! I guess you can say I like fry bread now ",

An employee was cleaning the bathrooms and greeted me as I waited in line to order. The employee taking my order was nice enough.  I got the Green Chili Taco and a Lent tamale. The outside of the frybread was good. But the all that gooey green chili basically tore through the frybread because it was so thin. Not good. The chili itself was egh. The lent tamale which had corn and chili was better. But they were just reheated in the microwave before being served. I observed the cashier tell the cook who was reaching for the refrigerator that \"there's one more Lent.\" It was okay I guess, the outer edges of the masa was a bit hard from being reheated to long... sigh... It just isn't the same when they were at the old tiny place.  The also had a Marketplace for Indian jewelry. I didn't walk over becuase they tend to be overpriced. But it was in the other half of the seating area with a little handwritten sign over the door way. Between the marketplace and kitchen I guess was the \"cleaning supply area\", all their supplies were in plan view becuase the sheet was pushed and held to the side. It just doesn't look good.   It may seem like a step up into a bigger place, but its actually a step down.",

Why are they not making this everywhere in the US. It's like an elephant ear as the bread used for a sandwich, with many option as stuffers for the insides. We ordered the beef and green taco, whoa are these things huge!! I was expecting the same as the Mexican restaurants that they have in Chicago where you order two or 3 small tacos.   So be warned that 1 fry bread taco = 3 Chicago Mexican Joint tacos  Now that I'm back home, this food is probably the most thought of during my summer, every time I'm at a fair or carnival I'm wishing they had a Fry Bread cart.",

A simple red chile beef taco.  I went ultimate - all the toppings.  Holy crap!  I hate it when I drive by a gem 100 times without giving it a try.  This is going to be a regular for sure.  It's a 5-star bit of food wrapped in a weak service and marginal cleanliness package.  The table we sat at was sticky, the guy who brought our food dropped it splattering a salsa bottle all over the table.  They give you only 1 see-through napkin for what is a messy meal, and although he said more were available - not handily.  Treat it like a giant immobile food-truck.  I'll make it a to-go place, but I'll be \"to-going\" once a week.",

Went here intending on just having a small bite but ended up ordering an ultimate shredded beef taco and chips and salsa.   The chips and salsa were really good and the portion was surprisingly large, but the taco was absolutely amazing. It's big enough that if you can finish it, you might slip into a food coma at the table and it was fantastic. I also tried a beef tamale and it was equally good. Check this place out and bring your appetite, maybe your neighbor's appetite too.",

Some favorites include: green chili stew (soooo spicy, but delicious), pozole, tamales, and basically anything with the fry bread.   Two specials really stick out to me: the squash burro - super light, but savory and comforting, and the kokoji, which is tasty mass smothered in their green chili.   They make all the food to order, so don't be surprised if you're waiting 10+ minutes on a busy night for your food to come out.

I moved down the street and I drive past this place every day so I decided to give it a try. I got the beef taco with cheese, beans, and lettuce wrapped in fry bread. A very unhealthy meal, but it will surely fill you up. It was decent I think but nothing really to rave about. Personally I think it would have been better with more toppings of some sort.   Then, I got the fry bread with honey and powdered sugar. This one was just toooo sweet, it's overflowing with honey. Would have been better if they just drizzled the honey and added powdered sugar.   I got some soda too, and I only took a sip because it tasted weird, like there's something else on it...   Aside from that all in all, it was an okay experience. If I do go next time, I will probably try the fry bread with chocolate.",

I ordered 2 to go and there was a very small amount of beans inside. I opened it up and tried to spread the beans out and it was more lettuce & tomatoes than there was beans... Other than that it was pretty good. The red salsa is also pretty good... Would I give them another try? Probably not...",

As soon as you come in, you can feel the fun with ropes coming from the ceiling and to the ground (I think it was a game); there's cute little figurines at the counter, and they give you toy food to decipher your order. Super super adorable.   The cinnamon sugar fry bread was super super delicious, absolutely loved it! I ordered the beef taco and my husband ordered the green chili beef taco. They were a bit disappointing unfortunately as the beef's grease soaked into the fry bread which caused it to fall apart and since the fry bread was already slightly greasy to begin with it ended up being a bit of a mess... to be fair, it may just be that we didn't eat it fast enough or knew how to eat it properly? But we really wanted to enjoy the authentic experience but just couldn't get past the mound it turned into.",

This trip to Phoenix, fry bread was on top of my list so I asked around and Frybread House was recommended.  Did not disappoint!  The green chilies in the beef were a bit hot for me but fortunately the woman who served us was very helpful and suggested on the side. We got one green and one red and the red was great! We ended up getting two to go for my niece's boyfriend and he also said he'd definitely go back.  The honey Frybread was perfect for dessert but I had to eat it later because we were all so full and happy. Aheehee",

I went to Phoenix to see the White Sox take on the Diamondbacks and I flew in that Friday morning.  After I got to the hotel I quickly found my way to the light rail which took me north to Indian School Road.  And then I caught a bus for a quick slide over to 7th avenue.  I ordered a red taco AND a green taco thinking that they weren't too big but perhaps I should have paid attention to what was on other people's plates.  They were both really, really good and if I had to pick a better one, I'd say that the red chili was slightly better than the green. The red tamale was OUTSTANDING and next time I go in there I'm a gonna order at least 5 of those.  Did you read that last sentence?  I repeat, the red tamale was OUTSTANDING. The inside of the place wasn't much to look at but if your food is that good, then who really gives a fuck what the decor looks like?  Helpful tip:  Go there really hungry.",

We also got cinnamon and sugar fry bread, and honey fry bread.  *nom!*  The only bad thing was it's fried (duh) so the grease factor is extremely high.  I really can't eat a taco AND share a dessert bread without getting sick.

This place rocks. They have an assortment of native style dishes, like the red or green chili stew (that come with or without the bread - but puh-leeeeeze get the bread) and mexican/indian type things. Today I had the indian taco; re-fried beans, cheese and lettuce wrapped in, what was that? Deep fried flipping nirvana-esque bread did you say? Oh hell yes. And the salsa is pretty good too.   Then just to make sure I would require an ambulance ride home complete with frequent use of the defibrillator, we topped it all off with fry bread covered in honey. Oh my god, my mouth is watering.

Personally, I like fry bread \"as is\", particularly after a quick dip in the red beef chile or hominy beef stew, but those wanting something with a bit more pizazz can order a wide array of sweet or savor toppings (cheese, honey, cinnamon, powered sugar, chocolate, beans, etc)  When I visited the first time, I had the red beef chile stew early in the day and later returned later that evening with a friend to have the hominy beef stew.  By the time we finished, the place had long closed, and the owners were cool about politely waiting until we finished.",

The menu has a lot of variations on he same thing, and items are just different fillings for the fry bread.  You order at the counter and they call you for picking it up.  Dining is simple and spartan.  there is eating area outside too.  Everything our party ordered was good, but I would not give it an off the hook rating.  All in all with the price being cheap, it was a place that I would recommend and visit again.  Excellent for take out due to the limited seating.",

Add this to your list of favorite local mom and pop ethnic restaurants to take out of town guests, it's one of those unique places that my return visitors tell others about and ask to be taken back to.  If you're lucky you may see former Governor Rose Mofford (beehive hairdo and all) enjoying a frybread in one of the booths.  i'm partial to the frybreads that come with green chili, either on board or on the side.  the powdered sugar and honey one's also very tasty but i usually don't have room for that after a meal...but hey, you could stroll up  7th Ave to checkout some of the cool antique and vintage fashion and art shops in the Melrose neighborhood, then stroll back to FBH for that powdered sugar and honey frybread.  in the past they have sometimes had a live chicken scratch band playing in their parking lot on First Friday night which only adds to the local color.  i need to go by and see if that's still the case -hope so!",

I actually heard about this place from many Phoenicians but wasn't really a fan of fried bread. The food is always phenomenal, the prices are great and you know you're going to leave with a full belly. I went back recently and am not sure if I somehow overlooked it but I noticed that now they have menudo on their menu! Not just served on Saturdays and Sundays like other places. It was excellent! It had a spicy kick to it and was not uber greasy like some places make...actually many places. I find the staff friendly, the environment comfy with all of it's earth tones, and an overall awesome little place to go when you want something hearty. I actually have family that when in town, they come here straight away!",

Spouse had taco and I had hominy stew with fry bread and we were delighted and thoroughly satisfied with our meal and service. Nice to have people care about their food and share it with passion to the rest of the world! We will be going back and trying more on the menu! People were so friendly and full of smiles instead of this is just a job face looking at you. The place is clean and has some pretty awesome artwork on the walls. They are now open to 9 pm except on Sunday.  Have not enjoyed a meal so thoroughly since eating at the Cameron Trading Post. The Fry Bread House is definitely a place to visit on a regular basis and if you are a tourist...a must stop!",

    "text": "\"I like it so much I'd like to eat here everyday for forever.\" That was the comment from a four year old when I last ate at the former location of The Fry Bread House. Fortunately, the food remains as good as ever, not harmed at all when the capacity to serve customers expanded.  A great place for visitors to Arizona who want to sample some genuinely regional cuisine, specifically derived from the traditions of the Tohono O'odham. The Native American craft booths are a fun bonus.   Just don't expect much in the way of ambience. You can sense that the building was once a cheap Mexican food cafeteria. Oh well. Just convince yourself it adds to the charm of the establishment.  I must admit that I do miss the sketchy and cramped confines of the old location, but having a little extra room to dine is nice. It must also be great for the Native American craft vendors to have space inside in air conditioning.  The staff has always been friendly to us. I read some reviews on Yelp that complained of inattentive service... Surprising to me. I'm suspicious that some of those negative comments may be the result of cultural miscommunications. We weren't really greeted when we entered on our most recent visit, but the server who brought our food to the table was very engaging and we were warmly sent on our way as we exited. I'd characterize it as a kind of quiet friendliness that you might miss if you aren't accustomed to it.  Save room for dessert!",

Also, fry bread with honey and sugar for $7.49 seems pricey. Probably would go back and just get the plain and bring my own honey and sugar.",

    "text": "So as a native Phoenician, I grew up eating fry bread. But here's the deal... the only place you could get it was at the Arizona State Fair (And believe me, my folks would actually plan ASF trips for that very purpose!) or if the Heard had some special event.  What can be said of puffy little pockets of air and chewy goodness fried up in some hideously unhealthy concoction, thereby creating a crispy yum yum shell which you can top to your liking? Holy Mother of God my mouth is watering just thinking about it!  The people are friendly, the food is great, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the sauce should be nominated as a sixth food group in itself... foodies unite and to hell with diets!!!   The only downside to this place is that parking can be a nightmare (my sister went once and almost drove over someone napping on a parking block!) But seriously I wouldn't let that detain you from the food inside. : )  Whether you are looking for something veggie to carnivore or sweet and sticky the servings are generous. So put on your big girl pants, head on over to The Fry Bread House and pull up a chair.  love Love LOVE \"The Fry Bread House\"",

I wish I could bring all you yelpers to my village's feast day.... it's like... christmas in the early fall except the only presants aren't left under the tree but instead are scooped by 60 year old O'odham grandmothers who have been cooking since childhood and only know unwritten recipes that lack measurement, volumetric or otherwise.   I could describe to you the food we eat on San Juan's Day (in my village) or Saint Frances Day (Ak-Chin & Salt River)... but if you want a taste of what it's like to line up and part take in the ceremonial meal... head on down to the Fry Bread House.  The BEST way to experience this would be to go and order a bowl red chili stew with side order of frybread and if you're interested a lil baby bowl of beans. and then just wait. Dip and scoop the bread in the stew and enjoy. There's NOTHING better than moistening the light and crispy bread into the broth of the stew. It's heaven!",

We walked in to a small, clean space. You order your yummy meal at the counter and you have to be quick to grab a table! My advice, grab a table then go order. For my yummy meal I had the fry bread with beans and green chile. I was delighted to see that I could wash my guilt-ridden meal down with Big Red Cream soda...mmm.. When I bit into my fry bread it was crispy and light on the outside and nice and chewy in the middle. It was so good. I wished for a little more spice or flavor from the green chile sauce, but it still did the job. We also tried the chocolate and butter fry bread. It was so-so in my opinion, but I'm not much of a sweets person so definitely not a knock on FBH!   I will certainly visit FBH again maybe after I do a giant work out or have been fasting for 5 days... it's just too good to eat on a regular basis!",

    "text": "I have a weakness for fry bread. I've grown up with this food so it's not so much a novelty as a long time staple of this a native Arizonan's diet. It conjures up memories of taking out of towners to Canyon de Chelly to see Spider Rock, volunteering as a Girl Scout at the fry bread stand (all you can eat pillowy goodness!) and eating a \"Navajo taco\" with all the fixins right before hopping on the Zipper at the State fair.   Disclaimer: Erica does not endorse the consumption of fry bread before having the contents of your stomach whirred about in a frenzy of nausea inducing quasi-whip lash. Just ain't a good idea.  I pretty much stalk craft fairs with visions of deep fried crispiness topped with meaty, cheesy, beany, sweet and crunchity mmmmmm *drool*. Little did I know that full time fry bread heaven was less than ten minutes away!  The menu is simple, an indication that everything on there is done to perfection, especially the green chile, which was a-bangin' when I went. A couple of menus are right next to the register, so wait patiently for someone to pass one back to you if you're in line, or step up and snag one. You give your order to the lady at the register and it's fired back to the kitchen where it's assembled lightning fast and ready for pick up. Hot sauce is on the table and your silverware are beneath your taco (took me a minute to realize that) so take a seat and chow down!  There are the traditional tacos that consist of heavenly fried goodness topped with beans, red or green chile and garnish (cheese and lettuce), as well as dessert fry bread drizzled in honey or sprinkled with powdered sugar-- but you'll be much to full by the end of your meal to indulge unless you're sharing with a group. There are several stews (hominy, red and green chile) that come with a piece of fry bread for dipping and making lil sammiches. Or you can go the burrito route if the siren call of the fryer doesn't tempt you.  Don't forget to check out the jewelery out front. A gent with some turquoise and silver wares is usually there if you're looking to support some local jewelers after your nirvana inducing lunch.  This place is just as good as anything I've encountered on the Res, and ten times better than fair food.   And that my friends is a recommendation as glowing as the lovely sheen of oil topping your taco.",

    "text": "The origins of the Tohono O'Odham people are a matter of debate. Some believe they are descendants of the ancient Hohokam, whose presence in the Phoenix area dates back to the 3rd century AD. Others claim they migrated northward from Mexico three centuries ago. Their modern-day nation with its modern-day political boundaries is in southern Arizona, close to Tucson. And some of its citizens have opened up this totally awesome little shack on 7th Avenue for the rest of us to enjoy.   Last summer I took a road/bike trip through the Navajo Nation in northeastern Arizona, and first discovered the joys of something called \"Navajo Tacos\". I actually stopped at a hut, if you can even call it that (it was basically some boards held together by rope) less than a mile south of the Utah-Arizona border in the middle of nowhere. A cute, old, wrinkled Navajo lady made it for me and the very thought of it now makes my mouth water. I couldn't believe that this beautiful invention, which is so truly unique to Arizona, was something I'd never tried before. I was also sad, as I drove away, that I could only get it again by making the 4-hour trek to the Navajo Nation.   I have no idea if a Tohono O'Odham Taco is the exact same thing as a Navajo Taco. At the risk of offending anyone, I will assume it is not. But let's just say that the Tohono O'Odham Taco does the same thing for me as the Navajo Taco did that sunny July day by the Utah border.",

The red chilli soaks in to the fry bread which is completely perfect to begin with and sinful when topped with stuff. (like said red chilli) Whatever the step after sinful is, is what the frybread becomes when you drown it in the hotsauce. I am a big sauce guy. this is a big sauce. I would totally eat your granmother if she were drizzled in it.  Parking is a pain but it is well worth it. If you must, just park down the street. You are in the melrose district anyhow. Hit up Copperstar Coffee on the way or shop for your favorite record in Revolver Record store. Its the greatest area in the Valley.   You will not leave disapointed unless I get there first and eat  up all the frybread.  I am making myself hungry...I wonder if I can make it before 7.",

I have only had fry bread once before, on a meandering cross-country alcohol and testosterone infused college spring break with some buddies.  One of them knew about fry bread and not only did we have some, but we got a recipe for it!  (long since lost, and never tried, but such is the folly of youth)  Haven't had any since college, so thought I'd get it while the gettings good (i.e. while crossing through states like NM and AZ which I never do).  I am no connoisseur of the bread, though it's good and greasy.  Cripsy too, which was my favourite part.  I had the bread as part of the House special, choosing the green chile stew.  I have been out of Texas and the southwest, so I was pleasantly surprised that the thing was actually spicy!  A perfect complement to the fry bread.  It was very good. I'm not saying it's a must-do in Phoenix, but it does fit along the lines of SW comfort food, while at the same time likely different from most food to which you are accustomed.  On a cold day (night) it would be a perfect dish.",

Most fry bread at other places is of an entirely different consistency, but at the Fry Bread House, their bread is PERFECT! It goes well by itself, with a soup, or even topped with something to make for a delicious dessert!  The few times I've been there, I've also ordered the hominy soup which is very delicious to eat along with the fry bread.  I highly recommend those two together.  As for the dessert (the offer a variety of toppings for the fry bread, I've had the honey and sugar and the chocolate) Both are good, but the honey and sugar is a bit messy, so be prepared for that. The chocolate is also a bit messy. The different toppings add a bit more sweetness to the fry bread, but honestly, I find it best when served warm without any toppings at all.  Definitely worth a try!",

Again, it is definitely greasy, so if you are on a health trip, you may want to avoid this place. For the rest of us, who indulge, this is worth every pound.   The meat was cooked perfectly. The sour cream was abundantly present. The cheese was in all the right places (everywhere). And the fry bread was greasy, crunchy, and light all at the same time. Not sure how they pull it off, but they do.   I would suggest to go there for lunch for the following reasons:   -a wonderful break from work  -leaves you in a food coma, meaning that the rest of work with fly by  -it gives you the rest of the day to work the grease off  -just makes the day better!",

If that's not enough lets add some melted butter to it. Holy doctors worst nightmare!  Despite knowing what it was I was doing to myself I was still able to enjoy this delicious treat. The butter and the chocolate was a great combination. Its all tied together with the chewy warm dough that's been fried to perfection.   This was so rich even in a sugar binge eat everything in site kind of night I had to stop after half.  I wouldn't recommend this more than once or twice a year for your own sake. Bring a friend and share the MmmMMmmm",

    "text": "This place was such a treat to find. I was passing by through Arizona and we decided to stop in Phoenix for lunch. When we searched for Native American food, this appealed to us. First, you're greeted by a nice and hilariously sarcastic owner. I was a little worried when I saw one of the cooks in the corner, eating McDonald's though! lol  We got the green chili and red chili with the fry bread. The fry bread is about the size of a small pizza. Its hot, fluffy, pretty decadent, and super yummy. The green chili was more mild and less chunky than the red chili, but still good. Its good for people who want chili but do not want a spicy one.   But the red chili was out of this world! Deep packed with flavor, chunky, the right amount of spice.   The place is casual and will definitely make a visit back when we come this way. We took a quart home. We also had the butter and chocolate fry bread, which is their sweet specialty. The chocolate kind of tasted like middle quality fondue chocolate. The real star of the dessert was actually just the fry bread itself though. I have yet to taste the tacos but they look huge!",

We'd never had fry bread but have seen signs for it everywhere driving through the southwest.  We were at Chief Dodges jewelry and they told us we had to try this place, they were right!  Definitely split one if you're not a big eater cuz they are huge.  The staff was really nice, after I told them we'd never had it one of the cooks brought out a fresh one for us to see and the lady at the front went through the whole menu with us.  We went with her suggestion and I'd probably get that again, chorizo taco, and the chocolate and butter fry bread.  Both were phenomenal, I finally realize what everyone is talking about when they say you have to try fresh fry bread!",

We've eaten at the old location on 7th  several times and a couple of times on Indian School. The difference seems to be in the fry bread itself, the Baseline location fluffier and perfectly cooked while the Indian School location was a bit thinner and a little greasy. Both locations share the same excellent red and green chile and beans.",

    "text": "Your Friendly Neighborhood Cholesterol Paradise!  I took a couple friends in town from San Diego here some weeks back for a pre-Chez Nous banquet. Man, you have no idea how much I was looking forward to eating at the Fry Bread House after driving past this joint countless times. Yeah, yeah, I know, it's a politically incorrect, diabetes-inducing culinary wondercarb, but I still had to have some.  First off, it's a very casual place run by members of the Tohono O'odham Nation and the prices are pretty cheap. I looked at the menu and wanted to eat everything, but I decided to be good and *only* got myself the green chili Indian taco. I forget what my friends had, but we then split a fry bread with honey & powdered sugar for dessert.  And can I tell you, it was all so good going down. I sat there all content while listening to Michael Bolton's \"How Can We Be Lovers If We Can't Be Friends?\" oozing out of the soundsystem.   But then something happened. Something bad. My internal orchestra went into overdrive and I had to make a mad dash for the bathroom.   SO, the lesson being, for all you digestively normal members of the human population, relax! Come eat here! It's really good! Just don't eat here too often, or your body will hate you.   And as you for lactose intolerance sufferers, you're well aware that your body already hates you. I don't know what I ate here that caused my gut to go into a tailspin, even after downing 3 Lactaid pills. I'm usually great with eating cheese (pizza? no problem), but I'm assuming the cheese they used in taco was the culprit. Unless they cooked everything in clarified butter instead of lard or oil. Then that would explain things. So if milk has unfortunately become your enemy in recent years, proceed with caution.  But at least for 45 minutes, it was so worth it.",

I set my expectations low on the place because all the reviews told me it's not the interior but the food. So driving there I noticed it's really sketchy area of town. The outside of the building isn't maintained and neither is the plants or the parking lot but I really wanted to try this place so what the heck.   I walk in and all I see is a bunch of tables surrounding the place then in the very back I happened to see the counter. Very unusual to be so far back but what the heck.   Everyone told me the menu is in the wall so I walk up to the counter looking for the menu but the menu is to the right of the counter. All the reviews told me Red Chili taco. Had that in mind and that's what I ordered. I got the choice of retried beans or meat and of course I got the meat. They give you a number and you find your own table.   Anyways, I found my table and before I know it BOOM. I'm served. Very cool. Let me just tell you first and foremost. It's so dang good. The fry bread is so soft, fresh, and light. The red chili is out of the world. So good. Has a nice little kick to it. If you like it hotter, they bring out home made hot sauce with your meal. I tried eating it like a normal taco but wasn't successful. It's so messy but so good. I really did enjoy it.   The lady at the counter was so nice and friendly. The person who brought out my food and even the busboy were so friendly.  Like everyone said this is a True blue dive. Dining area is ok but the food is great. Don't come here for the ambiance or atmosphere cause there is none but come here for the food and nice service. I was very surprised by this place and for sure will be back.",

The 1st thing I noticed was there were plenty of signs telling you that they are moving soon, well dang it, I finally get here and they are moving! But it's not too far from this location, so don't freak out too much.  The menu is on the wall and it's pretty simple to follow, so when it was my turn to order I went with the ultimate fry bread taco with red chili. Took my number and headed off to our table.  One person in our group also got chips and salsa, and let me tell you, their salsa, its amazing! Great in flavor, I mean I could just make a meal out of there fresh fried chips and salsa, so good!  Order came out to the table and I have to say ITS HUGE!!! I mean HUGE!  It was fry bread the size of a plate, loaded with beans, beefy red chili, cheese, lettuce, sour cream folded in half, I swear I didn't know how to attack this thing, it is def something you eat with a fork.  The red chili is soo good, this fried bread taco was amazing, I couldn't believe I ate entire thing! So good, in fact I want another!  Another person in our group ordered the fry break with chocolate and butter, offered a piece for me to try, and man that too was simply amazing it was real melted chocolate and warm melted butter, oh that was sweet bliss!  If you haven't been to the Fry Bread House, you should go! I look forward to checking out the new place next month!",

I got the ultimate fry bread with green chili beef and it was so good, but a huge portion. We also tried a tamale, a friend corn taco with the best tasting ground beef we've ever had in a taco, and a butter, cinnamon, and sugar desert fry bread that was oh so tasty. Service was good and prompt!",

My husband, who ordered the food, didn't realize until after they had ran his debit card, that this was the total....too late to rectify it now!!! Anywho, next time we go there, it's gonna be CASH ONLY!!  They can't screw that up...I hope!",

    "text": "The Fry Bread House is a tough place to figure out.  We've been to this establishment three times at two locations [they didn't add a 2nd restaurant - it was a relocation], and now according to the lady behind the counter they are moving yet again in February. On our previous visit, they had been open at this property for only 3 months - now they are packing up to move yet again.  I'd rather of course that the Owners find success wherever the are, but maybe deep down I'm kinda just a little bit more hopeful now because I think it'll work out better for the Owners in the long run to take this saloon outa Dodge. This current venue lacks personality and reads more like a big generic cafeteria or meeting hall. The awesome food deserves a better context. We hope The Fry Bread House can find the charm and magic of their first location, where we first waited in a line out the door.   Their food is fantastic. They won a freakin' James Beard \"America's Classics\" award designation in 2012 - totally True. Google it. It is a very big deal.  I've had their green chili beef stew (awesome), their green chili beef taco with beans (fabulous), and most recently their ultimate fry bread taco with the red chili beef. The green chili is definitely hotter than the red, but the red has great flavors with just the right amount of heat. I love them both but my favorite bite here is always the rich, smooth and oh so decadent refried beans. Love the beans.   My kids always devour the coyote coins, which are little fry bread circles served with their signature refried beans smothered in cheese. So simple but so good. On our most recent visit my son left the coyote coins to my daughter and had the Cheese crisp on chumuth, which he loved as well. Also very simple.   Love this place, wherever they locate. Let's all do our part to keep this treasure in business. And thriving.",

The green chili is consistently serviceable and the fry bread, excellent.   But it is time this needs to be said: Fry Bread House, stop putting a 10\"-12\" fry bread on a 6\" plate!  Serving a sloppy fry bread (with a knife and fork) on a piece of yellow paper on top of an undersized plate just pretty much guarantees you're going to eat some paper.   The paper does not taste good.  Let's put an end to this game.   I enjoy everything else, though.",

However, as this was my first fry bread in three years since visiting home, I'll take it, and try not to cry over being homesick. To go with the fry bread I got a bowl of the green chili, and it had amazing flavor. Just fantastic. Spicy enough to make even me happy.   The price is right, and it's like a little touch of home for me when I was far away from home. I'll take it, and be happy.",

The fry bread was super tasty and fluffy and the green chili stew was flavorful and not too spicy. My in laws tried the stew alone and loved it and ordered a fry bread with powdered sugar and honey for dessert, YUM! Service was friendly but it did take a while to get our order in and sat. Good value for the price, we will be back for sure!",

Two people told us that our order was being remade, waited over 30 minutes. Had to speak to the manager to be remade, and had to wait even longer. I was terribly disappointed- Usually they do a good job. Their customer service was terrible. *Update- they brought out the \"tacos\" in little cups of meat and cheese with corn tortillas and told us to make them ourselves. I asked for a refund and they stated that they do not give refunds. I asked the manager  how she could treat customers that way? And her reply \"we aren't treating you any way\" and she was rude to us. They didn't refund us, yelled at us, told us that they had us ordering on tape and she wouldn't show us the tape. I was upset that she wouldn't refund us, and that she brought out meat and cheese and tortillas- I dumped the tray over and walked out. She tells the story on Facebook that I had a rampage...it seems like she has encountered unsatisfied customers before.",

Still has the same great food & owners, but this newest location is about half the size as its immediate predecessor location.  I spoke with the owner once, and she stated they moved from the Indian School location because the building was old and needed a lot of work.  This newest location is about as large as the original 7th AVE location, with slightly better parking.    Previous Review 10/13/2014 This is my favorite place for fry bread, and IMHO the best place you can go to get some.  I've been coming here since they we e at the location near 7th AVE and Indian School, and this spot is INFINITELY better.  Not the old location was bad, they just outgrew it.  This new location used to be a couple of different Mexican Food locations, most recently a Pancho's I believe, and was a Maya's before that, I think.  In any event, same great food, but a ton more parking and restaurant space  My favorites are the ultimate taco,  green chili stew with a fry bread, and hominy stew with a fry bread.",

However, lately the food has been somewhat disappointing. My lunch group and I were looking for a spot to grab a quick bite to eat. After noticing that the parking lot at the Fry Bread House was  full we decided to give it another shot. After all with that many cars in the parking lot the food had to be good.   However, our lunch was a disaster. The Fry Bread we ordered was soggy, greasy, and lacked any real flavor . My lunch companion ordered green chili and it ended up being the worst green chili she had ever received - and that was after sending it back because the original order was wrong.   My other lunch companion had the red chili fry bread, he said it was okay, but nothing special. I would recommend trying somewhere else.",

It almost seems like they intentionally hire the rudest, grumpiest people to work the register. The frybread is a good size and made to perfection but the \"bowl\" of stew is more like a cup of stew....the portion they give you is OK for my 4 year old but not a grown man. The taco is good but they charge the heck out of your wallet for additional toppings...lettuce, onions, tomatoes etc. Its a good place to eat if you enjoy being frowned upon by staff and treated sub human! :)",

They were open, but the open sign wasn't lit up, went inside anyways. I walked to the counter to ordered. FOUR different people looked at me, and walked into the back room. Okay..... The lady that would eventually be the one to take our orders, saw us, and then began organizing and restocking. Eventually, she came to \"help\" us. With no eye contact she took our order. I had she made a 30 second phone call to confirm someone's order and she was very annoyed. She asked if I wanted salsa with my order and I said yes.  The food came out quickly.  When I grabbed my order from a different lady, I asked for some extra salsa. The lady who TOOK my order overheard my request and told me that she already gave me salsa, and I can have 2 more, and THAT'S IT.  Well guess what? You can have one star and THAT'S IT. Worst customer service I have ever experienced.",

It basically was fried bread with lettuce, meat, beans and some shredded cheese slapped in it.  Very filling, and I got fed.  I really wanted it to taste good because my gf was all into it.

The fry bread was cold and greasy and there was hardly anything inside. The green chile might have been good had there been enough there to actually taste.  we asked for extra hot sauce (you get a little 1 oz cup with your taco but that's not enough) and the gal at the counter told us she was too busy, yet when my friend needed a box for leftovers she just yelled over her shoulder for someone to give us a box. Why couldn't she do that when we needed more hot sauce? Would NEVER eat here again even if the food was better. Their treatment of us told us they dont need our business.  If you are not from around here and have never eaten fried bread dough with mexican fixings on it, you might enjoy it!",

The fry bread was perfect. I had the green chili with all the fixins' and my husband had a red chili and cheese taco. He hadn't been all that excited about going here for dinner, but he changed his mind pretty fast!   Both the red and green chili were delicious. I preferred the green.   One son had a bean and cheese burro which was perfect from the tortilla to the beans that were cooked perfectly.   Another son had the folded cheese crisp and I don't know what they did to it to make it so yummy but I think it might have had a little magic in it.   For dessert we shared a chocolate butter fry bread and it was to die for but VERY rich. To share it between the five us we had more than enough.  The man at the counter was helpful and funny (in a sassy sort of way) and we didn't hold it against him that he was wearing and ASU shirt ;) GO CATS!

I stopped in FBH after a long time hearing about how great this place is.  After all, it is a James Beard award winner.  The menu left me immediately underwhelmed.  I went with the chorizo combo, which has sausage, beans, lettuce, and cheese inside of a folded piece of succulent fry bread.  The chorizo was OK.  All the other toppings were mediocre - the lettuce and cheese didn't exactly seem like the freshest lettuce and cheese I've tasted.   The drink selection was weak.  They only offer fountain drinks, for which you have to pay $0.80 for a refill. (I don't care about paying an extra $0.80 for some cheap liquid, but it's awfully inconvenient!)  How about offering some Mexican Coke or something?  I believe I've already mentioned how delicious the fry bread is.  But it's fry bread.  I haven't had *disgusting* fry bread yet.  Food trucks and various off-the-food-inspector-radar sidewalk stands in the ghetto have awesome fry bread, too.  Go here for awesome fry bread.

After the questions came to rest, there were two recommendations that we went with: the green chile and the chocolate and butter covered fry bread...let me just say that there is something truly magical about chocolate and butter on fried dough. There was definitely instant guilt but also instant bliss! That being said, the food here is just tasty!  Fry Bread House is definitely a local spot for locals.

All centered around fry bread of course. The service is quick and the prices are reasonable. There is not wait staff. You order and they call your name.The night that I went most recently was a busy night because of a fair that was happening on 7th ave, so the food took about 10 minutes, but usually it's pretty prompt.",

    "text": "I found the bane of my pregnant existence: a giant slab of fry bread loaded with beans, lettuce, cheese, grilled onion, and sour cream.. also known as the Vegetarian Taco.   The place isn't too big, and you place your order at the counter and wait for it. The food comes fast though, and when ours did, I gulped in anxiety over how to tackle the taco.. it's h u g e. Just give in, get a pile of napkins [and a moist towelette] and grab that delicious morsel with both hands and understand it's messy. It was love at first bite for me, tasting every ingredient nestled between two sides of one delicious piece of fry bread.   For dessert, my husband and I split a powdered sugar fry bread, and as he was so full from his green chili beef taco, I got most of it.   Bring your appetite and leave your Biltmore ladies behind, because hearing how fattening this wonderful place is would be a total buzzkill.",

Debbie who was working the counter was very friendly to the customer in front of me, but her attitude and demeanor changed with me. She walked away in the middle of still taking my order and checked her cell phone, answered questions and talked with other staff. I continued to stand there waiting to pay. FINALLY the other girl came over and rung up my order. $17.25 for two drinks and a plain cheese and 1 bean and cheese fry breads. I thought that was ridiculous. The gentleman with the long braid walks up and just puts down our food and walks away. He came back by and I asked him for a napkin and all he did was point to the back of the restaurant without speaking. I couldn't wait to get out that place. I did find the fry bread to be good. The beans were not hot and the cheese never melted. I considered this a long drive for NOTHING but a waste of $17.25.",

Got an Indian Taco (which doesn't feel PC but since it's owned and staffed by Native Americans, I guess they can call it what they want) with a drink for just over $5. The fry bread was super soft and not really greasy (like I expected, it being fried and all) with really fresh beans, melted cheese, and lettuce. For having no meat and just being a single taco, the prices are a little steep, but for being a small locally owned restaurant downtown, you can't expect Taco Bell prices. Nice staff, clean building.",

First I went with this stew called Menudo (red) -- yeah, definitely not a fan of the overload in hominy. I mean, this stew could possibly be amazing for those hominy lovers, but it's not for me. The taste and texture was not very appealing to me.  I then decided to try out their famous fry bread tacos. Fry bread I guess i would have to describe as a better tasting chalupa. Anyways, I didnt know which to choose from the menu so i thought that it was best that i try multiple ones since i might not ever get a chance to return to this area. The two I went with were the Chili Combination Taco (green) and the Chorizo Combo taco. Both were decent tasting, but it was so greasy that I feel like I will now be dieting for the rest of my life to burn off these calories. Although not my favorite of meals, it was worth trying out at least once.",

    "text": "My buddy Kevin N. back in San Jose told me about the Fry Bread House. He said I had to find it and try it when i got to Phoenix.  It sounded like a place I would LOVE.  So when I got here I started looking to see if I could find it.  I drove down Indian School on several occasions, turned down 7th St.....nothin.  After several attempts and a post to Yelpers I realized that I was looking for 7th AVE and not 7th ST.  Doh!!  With that issue out of the way, I made a trip over last week and found it!!    The parking lot of pretty full.....good sign in my book, and it looked like a little house on the outside.  We walked in and picked up a menu.  I wanted to try it all but I finally narrowed it down and ordered the Hominy Stew.  My daughter had some fry bread with cheese.  We were greated warmly, ordered, got our drinks and sat down to wait.  We did not wait long for our food and out came the fry bread and the stew.  My daughter LOVED her fry bread with cheese.  That is her kind of thing.  The hominy stew was perfection!!  I love hominy and there were chunks of tender beef in a nice broth.  And a giant piece of fry bread to go with it.  I was so full when I left.  I totallly loved it.    This is a great place!!  A nice little hole in the wall that serves up big portions for small prices.  You can see the ladies in the back cooking up  a storm!  This is such a little gem of a place.  I only wish that they could take all the calories and bad things out of the fry bread....but then it wouldn't be fry bread and it wouldn't be nearly as good.  *sigh*  I can't wait to go back and try the tacos, the green and red chile, or any of the other amazing sounding things they have on the menu!!  Seriously, get to the Fry Bread house now and enjoy!!    Special thanks to Kevin N. for telling me about this wonderful little gem!! Miss you Kevin!!",

It was recently named a James Beard American Classic. No frills, simple digs, this place let's the food stand out. And it does by far. The red chili stew was finger-licking good. Which is impressive since stews are eaten with spoons and typically don't involve licking fingers. I ordered the fry bread with beans, lettuce, and cheese. These are deceptively large and perhaps could fit an infant. I recommend buying a blanket for your infant, so you can eat the fry bread. Places like this make me sad that I don't live in the area. How I yearn to try the rest of that menu!",
