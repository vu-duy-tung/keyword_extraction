I ordered the chicken tacos with rice and beans, and the chicken was juicy and well seasoned. I ate every bite! Mr H. had the green chili burrito with rice and beans and our friend also had the green chili burrito.  I did sample the burrito and it was very tasty.  I was impressed  how quickly the food comes out, and they were very good about refilling our chips & salsa and drinks.      My first visit but it won't be my last one! I left satisfied and next time I might try the margarita's.",

Was greeted as soon as I walked in, and a server showed me to a table right away and took my drink order ($1.75 margarita please).  The margarita came quickly and it did not lack booze.  I ordered off their \"Specials\" menu and got the Baja Chicken Burro, and asked for beans instead of rice (no problem with the request).  While waiting for the food, I couldn't help eating a bowl and a half of their salsa.  Mmmmmm, mmmmm, good.  I told myself 2 or 3 times that it would be my last chip, but I kept going each time because the salsa was just damn good.  The food came out soon after - big portion, and all very tasty (although I have to admit, the chicken itself was a little bland, but the cream cheese sauce and loads of salsa was a saving grace).  I'm pretty sure I licked the beans off the plate... don't judge.  Did I mention I had had a rough day??  Although the chicken didn't impress, everything else I had did, so this place is a winner in my book.  How could you not love a place with $1.75 margaritas?",

    "text": "I have a simple life, big and small, soft and crispy, full of obvious contradictions and some surprising incarnations. The life of a tortilla is much like anyone else full of glamour, large family drama and constant transformation. I'd like to share that story with you here today, my life as a tortilla.  Ever since being a young kernel of corn I've know I was different from the rest of the ear. While the other kernels longed to be cereal and ethanol, I knew that I wanted to be a star. Celebrated each and every day, giving promise of a brighter and tastier future. Then it happened, I was suddenly plucked, mashed, rolled and pressed, being transformed from the ugly duckling into the beautiful swan I always knew I was. Destined for greatness in the kitchen of Mi Patio, I knew it was all coming True for I am the corn tortilla.  From the second you walk in the door of my home, you can sense my presence. Bold colors, comfortable seating and smiling faces were all there to celebrate my life and times. As soon as you are seated a hot, lightly salty and crispy bowl of me is sat onto the table. They've cut me into triangles so I'm easier to handle, then I'm deep-fried golden and simply beautiful. My 2 friends, Mild and Spicy, are a couple of salsas that love to hang out all over me. Go ahead, grab me and dip me deep into one of them, slather me in their tomato goodness, I deserve it as much as you do. I have another friend, the cold and refreshing Margarita ($1.75), who simply completes me. Enjoy them slowly while the wandering minstrels play requests from my motherland of Mexico, this would bring a joyful tear to me eye, if I had one.  On the menu you can find many of my brothers, sisters and cousins. My cousin Quesapilla ($6.35) is a real show off though his beginnings are quite humble. Some also call him native fry bread but I just call him a crowd pleasure. Stuffed with gobs of cheese and griddled until melted and bubbly, he tastes just as good as he looks. Spoon on some fresh pico de gallo and you'll see why the ladies swoon and the men groom. My sister from another mother, Quesadilla ($5.95) is a total sweetheart. She's wide, thin and crispy all covered with cheese and I mean that in the nicest possible way. She, Mild and Spicy have a triad relationship, all complementing one another in each melted bite.  Baja Chicken Burro ($8.35) is one of my favorite uncles. He's the uncle who shows up delicious and golden brown, draped in an outrageous creamy coat of sour cream and cilantro, Id have to say he is all about glamour and fashion. Much like season 1 of Project Runway where Jay McCarroll and Wendy Pepper would cat fight every single week, my uncle Baja simply does not get along with auntie Huevos Rancheros ($8.35), a snide but delicious bitch. Her fluffy eggs are perfectly cooked, her delicious Ranchero sauce and her rice and beans make for a satisfying anytime platter.  Not liking to sound like a total me-me, I do have to say that I taste pretty good wrapped around Carne Asada con Pico de Gallo ($11.75). Tender steak grilled to a nice medium and served with pico de gallo, rice and beans. All you have to do is fill me up with some of your juicy meat and it's a win-win scenario. I get to soak up your meat juice and you get to eat all 6\" of my round deliciousness.  Every family has a black sheep and mine is no exception. Coming from a Greek father and a Mexican mother, Gyros Chimi ($8.50), is one of mystery and excitement. Inside she is full of tender slices of roasted gyro meat, gently deep fried then she's covered in the perfect accessory, creamy cucumber sauce. To add to her difference she is served with a hearty baked zucchini complete with sliced onion and a rich tomato sauce. You'll have no idea what you're getting yourself into until you take your first bite, delish.  Unlike auntie Huevos, the Chorizo and Egg Burro ($6.55), is tasty and uncomplicated. Any chance I get to soak in sauce I'm so there! Try the #106 Beef Taco, Cheese Enchilada, Rice & Beans ($8.55) for a celebration of soak. Stuffed with cheese then covered in a slightly sweet and spicy sauce I taste real good if I can say so myself. I also enjoy being bent over, deep-fried then filled with beef and topped with lettuce and tomatoes. One bite into my crunchy exterior exposes my goods for you to enjoy completely.  I'm a firm believer that a meal is never complete without something sugary, it doesn't have to be too big. Fry bread with Cinnamon & Honey ($3.25) is sticky and sweet cousin of mine, who I like to call Fannie. Like my other cousin Quesapilla, she's golden brown, chewy and drizzled with honey and a sprinkle of cinnamon. After tasting Fannie, you might wonder why you've never given her a taste before?  Now that I've been able to share so much of myself with you here today, I feel a great peace and inner joy that can only be brought out by my loyal fans. In whatever form I take from a taco to a warm steamy basket know this, I am here for u.",

I've literally eaten here two nights in a row: the service is always awesome, everyone is so nice. I've tried many things on the menu and have never been disappointed, it's all SO GOOD. I'm not a vegetarian but they have amazing vegetarian options that even I get sometimes. Seriously, why go to filibertos or some place like that when you can get restaurant service for practically the same price, AND you get bottomless chips and salsa AND the food is better. Great good, great prices, great people/service, never probably go to another Mexican restaurant in Phoenix.",

It's not often you find an establishment committed to the betterment of the entire community!  For that they get another star in my book.  The 2nd reason is service. It doesn't matter how busy this place is, you are always greated by a smile, served super fast, checked on throughout your meal, etc. They really do excel at service!",

    "text": "Add me to the chorus of people who do not understand the effusive praise this place receives from the majority of Yelp reviewers.  I've been here twice. Both times, the food was solid, but nothing special. I tried the flautas the first time, and a combo plate with chile relleno, cheese enchilada, and beef taco on the second visit. They do give you a lot of food absolutely smothered in cheese, and the prices are moderate. (Doubtful you're getting out of here for under $10/person after tax and tip.) The margaritas are $1.75, but of course very small and full of ice...I wouldn't expect anything different at that price. The horchata is delicious and made with real milk.  So the food is okay, maybe slightly above average. The service seems to be hit-or-miss. The first time I went, I sat at the bar and the service was great and friendly. The second time, however, I brought my girlfriend and we sat at a table. The server couldn't have been much more rude - he was extremely short with us. He basically acted like we were wasting his time and was not friendly at all. The younger guys did come around and keep our chips and salsa well-stocked, but it couldn't make up for the attitude we got from the server in my mind. Maybe he was just having a bad day, but you shouldn't take that out on your customers in any circumstance.  Average food and hit-or-miss service makes Mi Patio a 3-star locale...I really can't imagine rating them any higher.",

We were seated within 5 minutes and drink orders taken immediately. We also had individual salsa cups and chips (a little dry) for the whole table fairly quickly as well which I appreciated as most of us were hungry.   With what the chips lacked, the salsa more than made up for. I swear, I could've drank it. It was SPOT ON.   The service was great. No one (to my knowledge) had empty drinks and our food came out pretty fast considering we had a large group. I ordered the cheese enchilada and it was delicious - though not comparable to the cheese enchiladas at Teepee. My only con was that I wish I ordered two instead of one!

    "text": "I tried the restaurant after reading the reviews. It was a nice, clean, quaint place. The male server I had was somewhat in a go,go,go mode. He spoke fast, acted fast and wanted my input fast. I asked him for his input on the Patio Chimi and he replied in a hurried way that it came as beef or chicken, which would I like? I began to ask him again and he basically told me it's either beef or chicken, which do you want? He wasn't interested in giving me any input about the Chimi. I choose chicken. I also provided if there was a hot choice I'd take it. He just looked funny at me as he walked away.  The older Senoira that brought chips and salsa was truly a sweet person with a warming and friendly persona. She was cheerful and enjoyable each time she came to my table. The Senoira at the entry area was also very friendly and cheerful. My male server was the only one that made me feel like I was an inconvenience. He couldn't slow down enough to be friendly and I don't think he cared to. The  place was busy but no other staff were acting in such a way. The others were attentive but friendly while doing so.   The Chimi had a unique taste that was an enjoyable change from the normal chicken chimi, but it wasn't spicy hot at all. Quite \"Gringo\" as far as spiciness goes. It was also soft like a burrito though instead of having that wonderful crispy exterior. It was smothered but that wasn't causing the soft exterior. The rice was done well, soft but not mushy with good flavor. The dish also came with a side of unseasoned/flavored shredded cabbage but since I like cabbage it was refreshing.  All in all it was an acceptable lunch. Prior to choosing Mi Patio I was considering going to Los Dos Molinos but thought I would try something new and Mi Patio had good ratings. I like hot food and Los Dos, still, has the best!  Mi Patio's food was fine but it isn't on par with Los Dos Molino's food. I'll continue going to Los Dos Molinos for my Mexican food cravings.",

I had the chili relleno plate with no rice, but add garnish (lettuce/tomatoes). The relleno was packed with cheese and the sauce was a perfect amount without overpowering the chili flavor. I received a good portion of lettuce. My husband had the combination plate (enchilada, tostada and taco). The food was very tasty and plentiful. He brought the tostada home. Our drink glasses never got more than half empty and the the salsa and chips get flowing. I am very glad we tried this place and will be back when i that area of town again.",

There salsa is flavorful, and has a slight kick to it. I ordered chicken enchiladas, one with green salsa and another with red salsa. Overall, in my opinion the enchiladas were standard (nothing too special). I would like to come back to try other items on their menu, especially the chimichanga that looked AMAZING!   In regards to the service I give 5 stars. The staff was very polite and attentive even while they were very busy. Extremely quick service and I barely waited 5 minutes for my food even while they were busy.   Overall, fantastic service, chips/salsa, and margaritas. The enchilada was mediocre. I would comeback.",

The staff is friendly enough, but I didn't like the food.  I didn't really care for the salsa. It was fresh, but it had a muddled flavor of old cilantro that I didn't like. Also, the chips were stale.  Our food came out quickly, but I was pretty underwhelmed. I had the beef enchiladas with green sauce. The rice and beans had a burnt flavor; it's hard to describe, but I didn't like it. The meat did not taste fresh, and I couldn't see or taste the green sauce. Personally (and I know I'm in the minority here), I thought there was way too much cheese on the plate. I like cheese, but I don't want so much that it makes the food greasy. My husband had beef tacos with rice and beans. He liked the rice, but he felt that the beef wasn't fresh. He didn't finish his plate.  The prices were pretty cheap, but I feel like the food and experience was overhyped. I don't think I'll be back.",

Everything was way too salty, smothered in cheese and grease, and nothing seemed fresh. I do not recommend this place!

    "text": "What does 5 stars really mean?  To me, it is based on the individual restaurant providing great food, over-the-top-service, ambiance, cleanliness, fair prices and portions for the TYPE of restaurant that it is.  I feel that some people here are missing the boat with their reviews, as they will RAVE about the restaurant, food and service, but then only give it 3 stars!  How completely unfair!   So, in my reviews, this means that I could give a FANTASTIC McDonald's a 5 star rating if they DESERVED it, but I wouldn't give them 2 stars because of comparing them to a gourmet burger shop!  They are who they are, and if they do it well, they deserve the best praise.  With this thought in mind, ANY restaurant, no matter how simple or elaborate, has the same fair opportunity to earn 5 stars from me, if they deserved it.  If you understand what I'm saying then here goes my review....  Mi Patio is a mid to low price point Mexican restaurant.  Most things on dinner menu were around $7.00 - $8.00.  The atmosphere is simple and not intended for a \"night out on the town\".    My ex-husband and I went there tonight.  We had two large entrees, two large size margaritas and the bill was $5.00 after our $20.00 Groupon was applied. The service was top-notch, fast and efficient.  Our waiter explained the specials in a way that enticed me to order one.  The bus-boy refilled our salsa and chips at the perfect moment without being asked.  Our food was served hot and in large portions.  In the middle of the meal, our waiter presented us with two shot glasses full of a \"surprise\" on-the-house-special drink that was very tasty.  When we approached the register to pay after the meal, the gentleman was very friendly about taking our Groupon and he had a genuine spirit of appreciation for us coming into the restaurant, leading me to believe he may have been the owner.    Although this was not a 5-star meal, this place certainly DESERVES 5 stars.",

I grew up with my parents cooking amazing food, so it's nice to find a place that has chicken that is juicy and has flavor. Many places have big pieces of chicken in their burritos that are just dry.  Highly recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "Mi Patio is our favorite restaurant.  Not just our favorite Mexican restaurant...our favorite restaurant, period.  I love the Greek influence since most \"traditional\" Mexican restaurants in phoenix look at me funny when I ask for vegetables.    The servers are always fast and friendly.  the owner and managers talk with us like we've been friends our entire lives even though they may not even recognize that we are regulars.  we eat at mi patio for dinner, lunch and get lunch takeout.  it is always exactly what we were hoping for.    if you enjoy hot sauce we've discovered that they make a spicy sauce using Frank's red hot but you have to ask for it.  we ask for the diablo sauce since that is what they use for the diablo shrimp dish.  mi patio is great for vegans too.  they don't cook anything with lard and give you the opportunity to order anything without the cheese, without looking at you like your crazy.  Ive enjoyed the vegetable enchiladas (Mushroom, Zucchini, Egg Plant) without cheese and didn't feel like i was missing out on flavor.  their chips and salsa are my favorite in all of phoenix and they give you plenty with your food whether its to stay or to go.    kids are always treated with respect and they have tons of tolerance for our occasionally screaming 1 year old.  the kids meals have huge portions that make for great left overs and ice cream when theyre done!  our 5 year old asks to eat at mi patio at least twice a week.  we LOVE the margaritas!  there's nothing fancy about them but who needs fancy when you get to pay 2 or 3 bucks for a big ass margarita!?   don't let the outside of the building trick you into thinking its just a sleazy Mexican bar.  the beer banners totally turned me off before my husband made me try it for the first time.  just walk inside and enjoy the best of Phoenician Mexican food!",

When we went to the Safeway store across the street we could see that this restaurant was packed every time we went by.  So the last night we were there we checked it out.  The first person we met was a woman who had driven in from Flagstaff (over two hours away) and headed straight to Mi Patio!  She raved about the food.  I have to agree...the food was delicious!  I had the spinach enchilada with a delicious white cheese sauce with a cilantro pesto.  The beans and rice were terrific.  I drank the ice tea and it was also really good.  Love the food and the waiting service was also terrific.  All I can say...it may be the best Mexican food I've ever eaten outside of Texas!  You all are lucky!  Wish I lived closer!",

Just a super low-key, homey atmosphere, decent food (what you would expect-- quick, stick-to-your-ribs Mexican that they know how to do well), great place to just go and hang out, lunch or dinner.

I have given it many trys but, I just cannot do better than a 3 star for them.  They are a good location right on the corner, and they always seem to be busy.

The entree was good but rice was slightly dry. And I found a small black hair on the side of my plate. Cooks should be more careful. And that is why 4 stores.

I started coming here when I went to PC a thousand years ago. Classmates & I would hog a table while conspiring to cheat on our exams. The money we'd save would be a nice little bribe for the professors and for the hacker that would ultimately get us the grades we so rightly bought. This is a great hideout, especially mid summer because  it's nice and cold and dark and the tracking device the family put on me tells my wife's phone that I'm at Sprouts across the street.

They had everything ready before we showed up and 6 bowls of chips and salsa on the table already. That made a huge impression. We were hungry and didn't have to wait. Can you believe one bowl and salsa for each person?! Awesome. Salsa was good.   This time I ordered a Baja sauce vegetarian chimichanga. It was delicious. I took leftovers home.   Others ordered Baja sauce burritos and a taco bowl.  They enjoyed their food as well.   A variety of margaritas were ordered. They weren't strong and you could enjoy the flavor.   What was weird was that their red and green enchilada sauces were not vegetarian! Glad we asked and didn't assume. That's why everyone had Baja sauce.

From getting there and being seated right away to friendly and efficient service it we a great dinner. I had the fish flauta- it has an amazing cilantro pesto. The other people in my party had fajitas and the veggie enchilada. All were excellent as were the margaritas. Friendly service, great prices, and delicious food. Best meal of our trip.",

The chips pretty bad, the salsa was okay. I ordered the Chicken Chimichanga. It wasn't bad, but all the water in the chicken was pretty gross. My whole plate is soaked in chicken water. The service is passable. I have to wonder why they have received so many favorable reviews. I think it's because its cheap. There is nothing special here.",

My family and friends clearly noticed it too even the man refilling our salsas noticed it and said he apologized for his boss not checking on us more.

These were some of the best enchiladas I have ever tasted.  The rice was authentic, and I ate every speck of the beans.  I often don't finish the beans when I eat at a Mexican joint because they usually taste. . .blah.  No blah here--just REALLY good.  Distinct salsa flavor--more chips please!

The food is good, I am very confident in trying different things on their menu because I have never had anything bad. This is VERY RARE for me.

The food was not at all what I expected portions were good but lacked the authentic Mexican food flavor.     We would only come back for  the customer service",

The chips and salsa are quite standard and decent, The veggie enchiladas with mushrooms, zucchini and more are also great, large full of well sauteed veggies in a flaful sauce and smothered in the obligatory cheese.   The real key to the rating here was the speed, at lunch one does not have the time to wait 20 min for food and 10 min to order. Here you can order with in a few min of sitting down munch of 10 chips and 6 min later your hot food will arrive.  This makes it a great place for a lunch meetup.   There is plenty of seating but not much parking so carpool if possible",

It had a lot of meat and less veggies, which I would have preferred the opposite, but it was still good. It wasn't overly greasy either (which is normally a problem with fajitas). A friend got a Mexican pizza that was also huge! She easily could have shared that with two others and I would recommend that- it was expensive. I payed $15 for my fajitas...  The service was good with very nice servers. The chips and salsa were continually refilled without having to ask- and at the rate I eat them... that's always a plus when they can keep up. I liked this place, but I wouldn't go again because the food was just normal, the location, and price.",

Small place, nice decor, nothing fancy, but had a great feel.  Friendly staff and before I knew it, I had some chips (seemed fresh) and salsa...my favorite, sometimes I could just sit and munch and forget about anything else. But, I was on a mission...to eat. Checked the menu, everything was there. I chose the Chimi with beef.  For me, this was the right choice, I was great and there was not a morsel left on the plate. The beef was especially good with a good texture and seasoned just right. All of the ingredients seemed fresh and blended well.  I am not familiar with the restaurant as it is quite a drive from my home, but if it were closer, it would be on my regular list as there are several menu items I would like to try. I am sure Mi Patio has a steady following of satisfied customers. I am a fan",

Literally this bartender is THEEE definition of rude. She was negative as soon as we were sat. Not even greeting us, naturally I initiated a hello & made casual conversation about how busy the place was & how much money is out there she replied abruptly and snarky with \"well if these people decide to tip. It all depends on the people\" I was taken a little a-back by the response but OK?? That set the tone for the rest of the visit. I wasn't served water, I had to ask. My license was thrown back at me, after requesting a margarita. I had to ask and was made to feel like a nuisance asking for water, chips, and salsa umm isn't this standard !?  You could imagine at this point I didn't want to order any food to accompany my margarita however, my friends had already ordered.  Without even asking she held up my friends orders ASSUMING I would order too.  I had to instruct her \"I will not be ordering you need to put their food orders in.\" At this point the bartender ignored requests for water, said \"sure\" or \"hold on\" when asked for refills. If I had driven myself I would've let her have it and walked out but I had to keep my composure as my friends ordered food and I was with them. She slammed food and drinks down. I left a dollar tip because she poured my drink NOTHING ELSE. I did not order another drink & urged my friends to hurry up as I did not want to spend another minute being treated like I wasn't a paying customer !? This place gets 1 star cause the margarita was actually decent for a sweet price. The sour that came with it? I'll never be back.",

I pretty decently priced I love the chimichanga meal that they have there it'll run you nine bucks after tax for a pretty big meal to be honest I mean patios lunch dinner whatever can hold you off for entire day if I'm being honest with you huge portions great taste their chips are very addictive. Their drinks great drink specials just going to throw that out there as somebody that I likes a little alcohol. You can go there for their happy hour time and hardly spend any money on the margarita stuff their beer all that other stuff you go there was like a good group or by yourself or on a date and you will let's say was a meal and everything else let's say you spend thirty to forty bucks and and nothing else for two or three people you are going to be quite happy with your decision. The place is nice the people are nice that serve they're not really surrounded by anyting some people might would there be decently packed parking isn't too difficult to I feel like I've never been there I can find at least one spot either in front of the restaurant are behind but once again not a bad location on 7th Ave and Osborn the only thing I might want is for them to be open a little bit longer but besides that great place I would recommend eating their especially once again for Mexican food obviously",

The wait staff continually provided fresh chips, new salsa bowls, and fresh ice water.   The food is delicious Mexican food. Entrees can definitely be shared. I ordered the cheese enchiladas; the meal was huge and more for 2-3 people. It was tasty, cheesy, and fresh.  I like how the restaurant gives each person his/her own salsa.  Salsa/dips/chips are a huge germ-spreader, so it's great to have my own salsa and not worry about others double-dipping.   The major issue with the location, though, is parking. The parking lot is tiny. I suspect a person could just park at the Safeway lot and walk over, if too busy.",

    "text": "Woke up in the morning with a craving for some comfort food. My awesome girlfriend worked overnight so she was not able to appease my insatiable appetite for some authentic Mexican food on this gorgeous Saturday morning. So I did what any guy would do in my situation.. Yelp \"best Mexican breakfast\".  After sorting through some establishments with mediocre ratings I came across Mi Patio. Hmm a four star..of course I was instantly suspicious as Phoenix has not delivered on quality Mexican food since my transplantation from San Diego ten years ago. I was, nevertheless excited, as I made my way to this centrally located cocina.  As I entered I was greeted and seated promptly. I was the first customer aside from 2 at the bar having a Bloody Mary. The hostess was quick to bring coffee, water, chips, and salsa to my table which I immediately partook of.  The coffee was hot but possibly reheated. Needless to say I had 3 cups of the cafesito. The chips were very good.. Hot and fresh. The accompanying salsa(which definitely spent the night in the fridge)was ok a bit on the salty side.  I have had worse but also much better.  For my platillo I ordered the carne asada, enchilada combo with rice and beans. The presentation was ok as I immediately noticed the cheese overkill. The plate was drowned in the yellow stuff. The server warned me as she brought out the supposedly hot plate towel in hand. My first bite of the arrozito debunked this myth of hot food out the kitchen.  Having had my first bite of the rice  I hesitantly tried a mordida of the cheesy beans and bistek. As previously mentioned the beans were not distinguishable amongst the sea of yellowness. The carne was ok nothing to write home or yelp about. The final disappointment to this dish was the flour tortilla that came on the side wrapped in a steaming foil. As I unwrapped its silver lining and handled it I could see and feel this was a sorry store bought excuse of a tortilla    Taking a forced bite confirmed my suspicions.  Unfortunately  I will not be coming here again. The service and staff seemed nice. The food however is below par from what I'm accustomed to.",

    "text": "We stopped in at this place because it's super close to our new home here in Phoenix. I was slightly wary, as my fiance and I have had plenty of Mexican food all around Phoenix (and, since I'm from Tucson, right along the Mexican border), and are pretty versed in it. It's always difficult trying new Mexican places, because once you know what's good, you keep coming back. Let me say I'm extremely happy we gave this place a shot.   First of all, the service is absolutely incredible. I work as a hostess in a 5-star restaurant in Paradise Valley, and I swear the servers there pale in comparison to the people working at Mi Patio. Our server was super-attentive, gave us the time we needed to look over everything, and made sure we knew all the deals before ordering (for example, if you do go, get the $3.50 large margarita instead of the $1.99 regular-size. It's more than double the drink for not even twice the price). He checked up on us as soon as we'd taken two bites of our food, and always made sure our drinks were full. The girl bussing was also incredible; she always made sure we had plenty of chips and salsa, as well as full water glasses, and cleared everything the moment we were through. Keep in mind, all of this was during the dinner rush, so it wasn't as though they were attentive because the restaurant was empty; this little place stays consistently crowded.   The food was pretty good, too; I loved the salsa, and my tacos were delicious. My fiance had chili relleno, which wasn't quite as good, but still pretty tasty. Not to mention the fact that everything is super-cheap (as Mexican food often is).   All in all, we had a great time. We felt welcome and taken care of, and the food was definitely worth going back. Definitely give this place a try!",

The people who rate it high usually comment, \"You can't beat $2 margaritas!\" or you have a handful of comments from vegans who are happy to have found a Mexican option.  Reviewers who stuck to talking about the food generally had lower ratings, so I had my reservations.  But in the end I was just down the street so I decided to give it a try.  I got the gyro chimi and it just worked.  The flavor of the Greek classic came through perfectly inside of the Mexican wrapping.  The cucumber sauce, lamb, and fried shell matched up perfectly.  The zucchini side was an interesting change of pace and the rice was excellent.  I enjoyed everything on the plate.  One knock against it:  It's oily.  The contents of the chimi (lamb, peppers, onions) can't be as densely packed as a regular chimi so you start to notice some pockets of oil that form on the plate.  Yes, I know a chimi is oily, but you usually it's absorbed by the food inside of it so you don't see it to the same extent.  Give the chimi a shot and you won't regret it.  I was there on a Saturday afternoon and the place has a nice mix of people enjoying some Mexican with others socializing at the bar.  Good options for a wide range of people.",

    "text": "Ok. My friend and I went here because of the extremely beautifully cheap margarita happy hour. The drinks were huge and very cheap but it was like drinking a vat of liquid sugar and zero percent alcohol. The service was really great though, and the complimentary bottomless and constantly refilled chips and salsa were really delicious. Maybe the food is great, but if you are looking for even a below average margarita you will be disappointed here",

Service was great, chips (nice and warm) and salsa were also great and the portions were huge. Food came within 10 minutes, but this morning has been spent in the bathroom. I didn't eat anything else in the evening or this morning, so guessing it was the cream cheese sauce. I never have an issue with any cheese or other sauce and my  wife feels fine. Will not be going back.",

Had the red chili plate, with rice and beans, it was good. I can't say that there was anything that really stuck out about the food. The restroom is rather small and outdated...

    "text": "This place has been on my radar for a while.  With the visit of a friend last year, and a promise to buy my birthday dinner ^_^  That said, I've only been once, so my perspective is limited.  First, our waiter, an older gentleman, was awesome.  He was friendly and sociable, so made our back corner table a little warmer with his presence.  Our waters were also frequently topped off, which is _always_ a priority in my restaurant visit.  Second, the chips and salsa...among the best I can recall.  The salsa especially.  SO GOOD.  And, maybe it doesn't show on yelp, but I've eaten more than my fair share of salsa, and this one is up there (e.g. went to some Salsa fest last year in Phoenix - SO disappointing).  And they kept it coming.  I mean, the \"and's\" could keep coming, but I'll tap it off here.  Third, the food was good.  I can't say I was as blown away by what I ordered, but it was good, and I enjoyed the leftovers the next day.  As to the price, I suggest you also get a friend to buy you dinner.  It makes it sooo affordable.  Still, looking at the prices on the menu, you're wallet probably won't hurt much, as they seemed pretty low to me.  Still, have birthday dinners as often as you can ;)  While we still have so many Mexican places that we've yet to visit in the valley, Mi Patio is somewhere we'd consider returning to.",

    "text": "The food was really good. I had three cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. It tasted like authentic mexican food. The service was fast and the restaurant had a laid back feel to it. The only thing I didn't like was that they charged me $1.50 extra for the 2nd enchilada and another $3 for the third. Why not charge $1.50 for each? It almost seemed like the server was charging me a bogus charge. When I was ordering my food I asked my server what it would cost to have three enchiladas instead of two and her response was \"I don't know.\" She never came back with the price until she brought the check at the end of the meal. When we got to the register we asked about a section on the check that said \"misc food - $3.\" The hostess asked our server what that meant and the server explained with ease. I mentioned to the server that earlier when I asked the price she said she didn't know it and now she suddenly sounded like an expert on the price. I felt like I was hustled. I loved the horchata but I felt cheaped with that as well cause it was only half filled with the horchata, the other half was basically just ice. I'll come back again but next time I'll try my best to keep my guard up so I don't get hustled again. I won't be ordering three cheese enchiladas or a horchata. I don't think I want to order any drink here if it's going to be half ice. At least the food was good. You should give this place a chance.",

I never find myself in this area much and would not have gone out of my way unless I read some great reviews on Yelp first.  So I bookmarked it Tuesday and 2 days later here I am.  Man the food was great, I had the number 100 which was recommended by the nice waitress.  It was a red beef tamale, beef taco, cheese enchilada, beans & rice.  My 3 year old son was with me so I got him a chicken taco with rice.  I have to say that the taco was the best i have ever had for authentic Mexican.  It was a homemade taco shell (which is really key) and full of meat, cheese, & lettuce.  Not to mention the hot sauce/salsa was spicy and very flavorful and went perfect on this taco.  I loved the tamale too, it wasn't dry and was packed full of meat, the cheese enchilada had a great red sauce and the cheese over everything was not overwhelming.  The beans were great as well which is an important test if you want to know how good a Mexican food place is...well that and the chips and salsa which were addictive too.  The atmosphere is casual with lots of decorations and pictures, you can tell it has been here a long time but it does not look old and run down.  The service was just awesome which is rare for an authentic Mexican joint, and the owner or manager came over and made my son a dog out of a balloon for him and it kept him busy the whole meal.  Thank you \"Mi Patio\" and thank you \"Yelpers\" as well.",

But unfortunately the chips tasted stale and even like the oil needed changing.  We were intrigued by some of the unusual combinations, so we went for the quesapilla. It was good, but in a greasy, boy, am I gonna pay for this later kind of way. It was described as sopapillas with Monterrey jack cheese inside. However, it was served as one large fried gordita-esque thing with cheese pouring out of it.   I also decided to try the Mexi-Greek thing they have going here, and ordered the Gyros Chimi. The menu claimed that it was served with a side of rice and baked zucchini. The zucchini turned out to be a veggie combo that included eggplant. Good thing I spotted those dirty nightshades before I plunged into my \"zucchini\" or else Hubby would have had to stay home tomorrow to make sure I didn't die. Alright, maybe I wouldn't die, but the last time I ate a mystery veggie mix in a D.C. Moroccan restaurant, it turned out to be eggplant cooked in tomatoes- a double whammy for me- and I was so sick I couldn't leave my hotel room. Anyway, dangerous False advertising. The waiter asked the cook to be sure, and then very pleasantly offered to sub it out. The Chimi was interesting- tasty, but so huge I could only eat a third of it. Hubby did better with his superior Baja Chicken Chimi (thanks for the tip- AGAIN- Julie!). The sauce is outstanding.  We shared a flan for dessert that was pretty tasteless- maybe calling it \"one note\" is kinder. Comedor Guadalajara has no competition here.  I'm not sure we'll be back- maybe for the $1.75 delicious house margarita. The Original Garcia's is far better in our book.",

A guy came out and made my kid a balloon puppy, which he was terrified of, but it was a really neat gesture. Everyone was so friendly. I practically had to beat the waitress off with a stick to get her to stop refilling my water and salsa after each bite/sip. The platter came out on an XL pizza dish and smelled to die for. I had no idea what I was eating as it all kind of looked the same (good mexican should look the same going in as it does going out though, you know its True) but it was fabulous. Im not sure if the cheese was real, but I don't think I care. There was a ton left over to take home and attempt to reheat later, too, and they had to roll us out to the car. But the margaritas? Nothing special. I didn't even get a refill, and thats rare for me when around cheap booze. The bathrooms were pretty gross. Hence the star deduction.  Its cheap, it's fast, and its a greasebucket. The folks are friendly and there are biiiig ole TVs and paintings of parrots. What more do you want!?",

While there actually is not a patio at Mi Patio there is standard Mexican fare (with a little Greek flare I might add) that is a step up from other local Mexican restaurants. My Chef took me there (I mean, he's a chef, the place is bound to rock my guacamole) and they seemed to know him. Lovin' the \"Norm!\" a la Cheers kinda thing when I go out with John. Interior was brightly lit, not a piece of black wraught iron in sight. Colorful parrots hang from the ceiling. Oh, did I say they're not real. Clay I believe. Anyway the food. That's why we're here. I had such a hankering for Huevos Rancheros I couldn't pass it up. Served with a chunky ranchera sauce over two corn tortillas along with some fantastic beans and passable rice, I was a happy Tomasito. Homemade flour tortillas are served along with the meal and they were dee lish. John had a combo plate with an enchilada in a savory and medium spiced red sauce with a serving a skirt steak. I thought that was cool. A combo plate where you can get a piece o meat. The guacamole, chips and salsa were all on my A list.",

    "text": "This is not a great restaurant, but I am fond of this place.   It can be loud and the chairs are cheap.  Tables are too close together and sometimes wobble. But I am fond of it.   Mi Patio doesnt lure hordes of foodie hipsters like El Bravo or Carolinas and the simple Sonoran fare is not remarkably better than Carlos O'Brien's - yet I bristle at Carlos and cop an irrational, almost paternal sentiment towards this place.        I am fond of Mi Patio because this is the home of nice, hardworking people - and whether they know it or not, their familiar routines and personal instincts comfort me.  The way the old man greets us too loudly before the front door shuts completely behind us.  The way the server seamlessly catches my eye and beckons us to follow him to a back table.   The way you needn't ask the price of recited \"specials\" because Mi Patio is devoid of deception. The way tortillas, wrapped in tin foil, invariably stay hot through your meal.  The way mistakes are courteously corrected without self conscious indignation or crocodile fawning amok in \"better\" restaurants. The way someone, somewhere, is laughing.  The way the old man looks in your eye when he asks how your meal was. The way he notices how tall your kid's grown, even though you only make it in two or three times a year.  The way I have enough cash to cover the bill. The way we take leftovers home and enjoy them that night.     Growing up in the Camelback corridor, my son has been weaned on corporate and chain restaurants, many of which are quite good. But none of them send him home with cheap bubblegum or a corny riddle, or dare toussle his hair. One day, when my son is my age, this restaurant and the old men - both of us - will be gone.  Perhaps the restaurant name will be lost to memory. But I hope he associates unpretentious decency and a quirky tenderness with Mi Patio - enough to look back and say, \"I was fond of that place.\"",

I say that, first off, because of the high ratings this place received - out of the 25+ people eating here there was not one Mexican sitting down for food - not even at the bar. My waiter wasn't even Mexican... He was a white guy. I'm white, too, but I live in San Diego and I'm 20 miles from Mexico, and I eat bomb Mexican food for a hobby.  My Chimichanga was weak (I know its Tex-Mex haha). I was disappointed by the softness, and the lack of anything but shredded meat (the quality of the meat was good) despite my add-ons. My company felt the same about theirs.  I really hate to give this place two stars because the service was soooo GOOD and it's a place with some character. I never had an empty glass of drink or bowl of their 'milder than rice' red salsa. I just can't give it a 3 looking at all these 5s, 'cause that's the story of how I got duped.",

Warning sign #2 - Sunday morning at 11:30 am nobody in Resturant. Still we were stupid enough to try it. Ordered food - a lot arrived - it was ALL terrible. Please - save yourself and don't go. By the way the Michelada was terrible too. Clamato juice and beer alone is not a good Michelada. Another Sunday morning and $70 I will never see again.

Gobs of melted cheese (not real Mexican cojita/queso fresco) was smothered all over the food, with a side of limp yellow iceberg lettuce. $1.99 margarita was cheap for a reason, it was all ice and pre made mix, could not taste the tequila.

I hope that Fred M's review gets pushed down to the bottom so that I look super original when I agree that the food isn't the best Mexican around, but it isn't terrible.    We'll start with one of my favorite parts of any sit-down Mexican restaurant - the Margs.  They are exactly what you'd expect when paying $3 for a pint glass - they taste like margarita mix.  I would recommend that anyone coming here flask a little Jose to help their beverages Man-Up a little bit.  The food was reasonably priced for how much you get.  I ordered the taquitos, which came out in tin foil as normal, softshell tacos - not sure if they mixed up the order or if that's just how they prefer their taquitos, but I'm not a complainer.  The chicken was great and the beans and rice were pretty darn good too.   Several of my companions ordered gigantic Chimis which were also really reasonable in price and came with very healthy (not literaly) amounts of guac and sour cream.    Service was great, and I think I'd come back here if I was looking for a step up above the taco shops I so normally find myself in.  Just don't tell the owner about my secret stash of tequila!",

I almost always, for 8 years, have gotten the spinach chimi with feta cream sauce. Yummy! It comes with rice but I always get rice and beans as I like to mix em!   I have also gotten their chicken guacamole tacos here too, they are good as well, tons of fresh guac!   My husband gets the spinach enchiladas as he dares to be different from me, he loves them as well.   The margaritas are cheap, not a lot of alcohol, but refreshing none the less and two of the big ones do suffice, I think they are $2.75.   The chips are not my favorite but the salsa, albeit mild, is super tasty and always fresh. The service is usually good and sometimes the server will bring you free fruity shots for dessert. The sort of shot is never known, it's free, I don't ask, never has a roofie in it.   Love Mi Patio!",

The only thing bad about the food was they served it when it was still way too hot to eat. Although they got me the food fast, I would have preferred if they had let it cool down slightly before bringing it to the table. I also had some of their margaritas. I really can't complain because the price is so good. I've had better margaritas, but for under $2, that's a pretty good deal. The waiter came by frequently and it was a pleasant experience. It's a fairly loud venue so it's good for a fun night out but not as good if you prefer more intimate conversation.",

But my sister wanted to go have lunch today, and with both of us having a craving for Mexican, Mi Patio is in the middle of our 2 offices so I decided to give it a try again.  Thank goodness for second chances...because Mi Patio delivered!  I found the restaurant to be much cleaner than on my initial visit, and the service was so attentive and so quick.  We never had our glasses less than half full without getting a refill, and the chips were flowing!  The chips were really good, served warm they were light and crispy!  Our food seriously came out less than 5 minutes after ordering, which is such a bonus when you are on your lunch hour.  My sister had the spinach enchiladas and loved them.  I went with a beef taco and green chile beef burro.  The taco was excellent, the shell was crispy and not greasy and the beef had a ton of flavor.  I usually measure a restaurant based on their green chile and their beans, and these were both excellent.  The green chile had tender beef and the sauce had some nice spicy elements to it.  The beans were creamy and covered in cheese, just the way I like them!  I will definitely be going back to Mi Patio, the food is good and the people that work there are so hospitable, it makes for a wonderful dining experience.",

Their chimis rock and their red beef quesadilla is a hit!   Service is awesome and I've seen the same faces since I was a kid- very personable people working the place and on top of drink refills. Food comes out pretty quickly too, making it a great lunch-time spot. I recommend going there a little early, a little late, or reserving a table for lunchtime however, as the place gets pretty packed!",

Sure they're not top shelf margaritas and maybe a tad watered down but they are better than what I initially expected from a $1.75 margarita. Seriously people. You're complaining about a $1.75 margarita? Are you never happy?? Now for the food. I love their food. That baja sauce!!!! I could eat that off anything! I would put it on my pancakes if I could! I have tried numerous menu options and always enjoyed what I had. The Nachos Baja Chicken Burrito Patio Taco (a deep fried FLOUR tortilla, not corn) Those are my favorites. (I'm not going to name beers because those are the same whether you get em at Mi Patio or a grocery store) It's a fun place to come with a few friends, drink a few cheap margaritas, good cheap food in big portions... You definitely get more than your money's worth here.",

Patio type tables and chairs with Terra Cotta tiled floors and Mexican influenced tchotchke decorations.  Promptly upon seating, a silver bowl full of chips and a side of salsa arrives.  Things are looking up.  Next, time to order a drink or 10.  My first thought is how many places serve a small Margarita for $1.75 and  a large for $3.25?  I am not sure who did the business plan for this place, but generally bars do not use drinks as the loss leader. Shh, don't tell anyone OK?  The large was a healthy size and I am surprised it did not come with a beta fish, so I had two !  Sipping on cheap margaritas helped wash down the somewhat stale tasting chips.  Maybe I am just use to super crisp chips, but the salsa did help with the overall experience.  I ordered the two chicken taco combo with rice and beans ( I always order with double rice and no beans and they accommodated that).  I have to admit, the chicken tacos were stuffed like a Thanksgiving turkey with plenty of chicken, cheese and lettuce.  I was happy with this result and could barely finish.  Overall a good meal, a very solid showing for the patio-less patio place.",

Honestly, this tasted like Kentucky Fried Tacos to me, and since I'm not a fan of fried chicken, this wasn't an enjoyable meal.   My wife got the Caribbean Martini and while she said it was delicious, the martini glass wasn't filled close to the top.

As soon as you walk in, you are seated quickly and they bring you some of the best chips and salsa that I've ever had in my life. And then they bring you refills of chips and salsa until you finally think that maybe you should stop and save some room for your actual meal. So then when your food does get there, the first thing you'll think is \"Holy crap that is a lot of food!\" But it is AMAZING. I have only ever had the carne asada burro, but I don't think I'll ever get anything else from here. It is a pillow-sized burro stuffed with chunks of steak, cheese and roasted bell peppers, onions and tomatoes. SO GOOD!! My husband has had a few of the other things and he swears that it is some of the best Mexican food that he's ever had, too.  The $1.75 margaritas are not bad, and they compliment the food really well. My whole meal was about $10, and I still had half of it leftover to take home! Besides the food, the service here is impeccable. The waiters are all very attentive to what you need and they are very polite and FAST!",

Within fifteen minutes we were laughing and completely re-energized (though the margaritas might have had something to do with that too).

    "text": "Hit or absolute miss depending on what you order. Chimi I had here was completely flavorless, green corn tamale also flavorless, dry and sauce on top not very good. What is good, is their cheap margaritas, shredded beef tacos w cheese enchilada, and amazing good salsa....although once it was too salty...and my beans last time we're not cooked all the way and there were crunchy beans in it. This is greesy yellow cheese food. Personally, I'm only able to eat here occasionally because if I ate here every day, I would probably need my gall bladder removed. But I could just order a big bowl of salsa with a spoon...and I would be perfectly happy. I just eat tacos and enchiladas here now, because every time I wander around the menu, I'm disappointed. But I'll go back...nice people.",

The chips were perfect and thin but the salsa lacked some heat... although that is personal preference.  I saw a sign for winning 2017 best chimi so I ordered that.  The award is well deserved!!! The green chili beef inside was also good enough that i would order it by itself.  We will be back!",

We felt like we were rushed to order, rushed to eat, and rushed to get out. The worst part of it all was how expensive it was for the quality of food.  Trust me DO NOT EAT HERE.",

Really authentic, like your Tia or Nana makes!!! I had #97...The Beef Taco was seriously stuffed full of tasty shredded beef, cheese, and lettuce, and the home fried corn tortilla taco shell, just like home. The beans were totally legit, you can always tell by the color if you cook.But the very best part was the cheese!!! The enchilada, and relleno where totally stuffed with, and smothered with CHEESE!!!! it was stringing down my chin. Loved it!! I am so happy that there is a vitialzation going on in that area, and I hope that Mi Patio will have another 35 years of success. I wish I didn't have to go back to work, I would have tried their house specialty Rocks Margarita always $2.79!!!!! If you ignore this place you are really missing out.",

    "text": "Mi Patio   It is an ordinary Thursday at 1 PM at the end of March. There is one freestanding sign at the corner of Osborne and 7th Ave. Nothing on the building tells you its Mi Patio. There is no holiday or special. The parking lot is overcrowded. There is very limited space through which to move your car. Alternate parking is across busy streets.  The table was steadied with a three-inch wad of napkins. We had to ask for chips. The salsa was very bland. When you asked for hot sauce, it was served in a little dessert bowl. They do not have hot Salsa. They do have clean bathrooms.  The food must be fresh. Chili Relleno and Cheese Enchilada were without flavor as served. The taco was full, and tasted strongly of chicken, lettuce. It was steamy and aromatic: lovely, crisp but tender at the same time.  The day after the Chili and Enchilada, after nuking, had a wonder taste. The pepper inside the chili relleno was tender, not at all stringy. It may be the hot sauce (Valentina & green El Yucateco) served right out of the bottle.  To enjoy Mi Patio you need to  1) Arrive without a car 2) Bring a 3-inch wad of napkins 3) Bring your own Salsa 4) Bring you own hot sauce  5) Bring a sleeping bag, small refrigeration unit and microwave oven. Order either #95 or #96. Eat the taco. Put the other parts in a plastic to go container. Refrigerate it overnight, while you sleep in your sleeping bag on the floor (remember there is no place for your car) Nuke it then eat it for breakfast: wonderful.  This place makes Uber Eats and Door Dash make sense. Your food ages in the privacy and convenience of your own home.  Barry",

U will be greeted with a friendly hello from the lady that receives guests in and seats them.  Chips and salsa are on ur table in seconds and constantly refilled.  The chips are fresh and the salsa is so delish!  I have tried almost all of the specials that they have every day.  The roasted chicken comes to you with an entire half of a chicken super hot and tasty served with rice and beans.  The fish tacos are fabulous and come in hard or soft shell with R&B and last but not least is the Chevalas special.  One shredded beef taco and a cheese enchilada with R&B.  Every plate comes out doused in shredded cheese.  This is one of my favorite places in Phoenix.  They have signed pictures of famous people who have visited like Snoop Dog and Dr Dre.  I can guarantee u will not be disappointed by this spot.  Ending the perfect meal is a bowl of bubble gum at the register to grab a piece as you exit.  I love this place and wish I found it a long time ago.",

The $3 HH margarita was also really big and plenty good for $3 plus it came with a free mini shot of tequila on the side.

I walked into mi patio and although the ambience had me worried as it seemed like a cheesy american mexican place.  They quickly brought me fresh chips and a nice spicy salsa--definitely a good start.  I had trouble deciding on what to order, so I ordered the veggie combo which combined a # of things off the menu.  Although it was on the greasy side, the food was fresh and all very tasty.  I added some hot sauce to some of the dishes as they were a bit on the mild side.    Not the best mexican I have had, but would definitely go back if in the mood for some greasy mexican food.",

That is the price all day, it is not a happy hour special.  They are not top shelf Margarita's but they are refreshing after a long day of work.  They also have $2.00 specials for beer all day as well.  As I said before the food is good, but it isn't the main reason I go there.  I have had several dishes and they have been tastey.  The only thing I would avoid is anything with their red enchilada sauce because it taste like it is from a can.  Just watch out their dishes come out really hot!  They always put out chips and change them when you are getting low, as well they have someone walking around with a jug of salsa to keep you swimming in salsa.    The decor is a little weird they have parrots everywhere and the chairs look like they came from a 70's fast food restaurant.  The service of the waiters has been 50/50.    I would have given it 3 stars if it wasn't for the cheap alcoholic drinks and the reasonable pricing.  It is not trying to be more than it is, which is cheap eats, cheap drinks and cheap prices.  Unlike other Mexican restaurants (see my other reviews of Mexican restaurants) which I tend to bash because the pricing isn't reflective of the quality.",

We handed him a personal tip on the way out to make sure he got his share.    The pro was that they gave us free shots.  I would imagine to make up for the horrible service, and it would have if they wouldn't have left us sitting with an empty table for 15 minutes after dropping off the bill without coming back for it.  We finally gave up on waiting and scrounged together enough cash amongst us to cover the bill so we could leave.",

We were quickly seated and supplied with a warm bowl of nachos and salsa.  Yum!  Off to a good start.    They had a good selection of vegetarian items on the menu which was great but made it was hard to choose.  Our waiter took our order and left us to munch on the tasty chips and salsa while we waited.  Dinner arrived lickety-split and was piping hot (hot plate!).  My spinach enchiladas were so tasty and my husband enjoyed his veggie enchiladas.  With plenty of time to spare, we had some delicious rice pudding for dessert.

    "text": "So disappointed! We used to live not far and remembered it fondly, but returned w our family recently (daughter and two well-behaved teens) and could hardly get out quick enough. In a town with plenty of quality Mexican restaurants, this was our sad experience: stale chips, sooo sweet margaritas from a commercial mix, \"char-broiled taquito\" consisted of soggy tortilla and steamy meat that had not recently experienced any charbroiling, shared fajitas churned out with no caramelizing or evidence of time on a plancha, essentially hot meat and vegetables w two tiny tortillas.  What happened to the old Mi Patio? Maybe it doesn't exist at 6 on Friday nights.  While I can't exactly fault the restaurant for our being trapped next to a raucous group of nine people at a table sized for six (they kept pulling up another chair \"Sure, we can make room\"), I do think well-run restaurants are attentive to the realities of maneuvering around with hot plates when tables are overfilled. That's on the end of server experience; as for diner experience, at one point, two of us had hand over an ear to soften the donkey-loud laugh of the woman next to us. Maybe it was amplified by the tunnel-like area near the back door, which we used to escape as soon as we popped cash (and a tip-it's hardly fair to punish the server) in the folder.   Our server was pleasant and efficient, I'll give them that, but do lament $80 and 80 minutes of my life wasted.",

The food is every bit as good as it ever was, they service super friendly, the salsa is the bomb, and they are extremely accommodating with changes to items if you need alterations or with making suggestions if you just can't decide. And be sure to always check the chalkboard menu when you walk in - it's always go interesting things you won't find on the menu! Elio and Tammy have been there forever & have great suggestions. The owner, Johnny, is great with kids... if you go in with the kids on Friday, he'll make balloon animals and bring free rice pudding! It's great for happy hour, date night or family dining.

I started coming here about a year and a half ago because it's a hop, skip and jump from my office and was the go-to Mexi restaurant for special lunches and happy hours.  For its decent food and SUPER-fast and friendly service, you can't beat it. It will satisfy that Mexican food craving but 'tis True it is nothing to write home about. (I imagine if I were from the East Coast or like Idaho or something, I really would write my friends and family regularly to brag about the amazing Mexican food in AZ, just sayin'.)  Cases in point of \"super-fast-and-friendly-service\": 1)Came here for drinks and apps with a friend and were about to settle our tab and head out the door anyway when our server kindly asked if we would mind moving tables to accommodate a large party - and we would be given margaritas on the house for the \"trouble.\" 2) Myself and two other friends dropped in for a quick bite and were brought chips and salsa before even ordering - I love that - and our margarita orders were taken immediately and were out within the minute. When our food orders were placed, the plates were out within three minutes - I'm not kidding! And our waters and margaritas were never below the one-third line before being asked if we'd like more. Also, the server gave not one, but TWO freebies: shots of sweet red liquid he simply called \"Mexican Kool-Aid\" (he even smiled when I hissed \"I think we're being roofied, go with it!\") and rice pudding. He apparently thought we might like it, and I sure did.  Anywho, it's consistently fast and friendly and pretty cheap too. Throw in those cheap drinks and what's not to love about that?",

Their menu was a bit overwhelming and I wish it had some pictures cuz I had no idea what most of it was.  In the end, it was good, and I'm sure I'd go back.",

Good service (crazy fast with the chips and salsa...and they don't short-change you on those!), and some of the best crispy chicken tacos I have ever had: good shredded white meat chicken stuffed inside a soft shell, and lightly fried for that tasty crispiness...all with more shredded cheddar cheese you could ever wish for.  Make sure you get guac, tomatoes, and green onions on top, too!",

Mi Patio happened to be close to another one of our destinations that evening, so it fit perfectly into my plans. After reading the reviews here beforehand, I decided to give the Baja Chicken Burro a try, and I must say, I will NEVER forget Mi Patio again. This thing was so delicious that it sometimes haunts me in my dreams! Seriously, it's THAT good. The chips and salsa were pretty decent, albeit a little heavy on the cilantro. Good food, fair prices, definitely worth a try if you haven't been there yet.",

Great atmosphere, authentic Mexican toucans everywhere.  The margarita was pretty good, especially considering it was $1.25!!!  Had the Texas Burro special for $5.55, beef and bean burrito covered with cheese and enchilada sauce with plenty of rice and lettuce.  My dad had his covered in green chili.  He said it is the only Mexican resaturant he has been to in Phoenix with green chili.  My dad loved it, and that is saying everything.  He always complains about Mexican restaurants in Phoenix not being good enough, but with Mi Patio, he was in love!  I'll be going back soon :)",

When we entered we got escorted by the Host to a table for two and supplied with menus.  He was not welcoming or talkative, just doing his job.  Shortly after, came the waiter, who was hostile and obnoxious,  to take our drink orders.  He made no eye contact and seemed impatient to get our order over and done.  The girl server who brought us our drinks and the chips with salsa was the only kindness that we were shown throughout our short visit.  There was also a screeching child making the atmosphere even more unbearable. The chips and salsa were underwhelming and my Sprite tasted like it was dunked in toilet water.  I would have reviewed the food but the waiter never returned to take our order so we decided to pay for our drinks and go.  No one stopped us to ask why.  They just didn't care.  I don't know if their food was good or not but we know when we are not welcome.  It was one of the worst experiences we've had in Phoenix.....Manuel P.",

    "text": "I know there are already tons of reviews for Mi Patio, but I wanted to throw my two cents in because I love this place so much!  This is my go to local restaurant - they serve consistently good food, it's pretty inexpensive, and it's only a few blocks from my house. Now, I'm the first to admit that I'm not much of a food snob, but when I want delicious, no-frills Mexican food and a cheap margarita, this is the place to be.  Don't get me wrong, they do have tons of unique offerings on their menu, but they haven't forgotten about the old classics. Luckily, they provide chips and salsa  to keep you company while you mull over the menu - there are a lot of great things to choose from. Some favorites are the quesapilla (like a sopapilla, but cheesy), the salmon flauta (served with this crazy-tasty pesto sauce), and the Baja Chicken Chimi (cheesy, fried, baja sauce-smothered goodness). Oh, and there was also a time when I was totally addicted to their beef tacos. I mean truly addicted - I craved those things like my sis craved peanut butter and Cheez-its the last time she was pregnant. And it didn't help that their take out taco special is only 6 bucks for two tacos, rice, and beans. Yum. P.S. I also have to mention that the service is great, the food gets to you super quick, and you never have an empty drink for long.",

The margaritas are not only really good and have a good amount of liquor but the price was ridiculous.  Being from LA Margaritas in my area are 7-10 bucks.

    "text": "I was craving chips and salsa one day, so I checked out some reviews and came across this place. My boyfriend and I went around 6pm or so. We were seated immediately and brought our drinks. The service was great, we were given our chips and salsa to start munching on while we looked over our menus. One bowl of chips and two servings of salsa were placed on the table and we began chowing down. Chips were fairly warm and salsa was delicious. Just a little bit of spice to give it a kick, but nothing too hot at all so probably great for many palates. :) Our chips and salsa bowls were refilled before they were even half empty and same goes for our drinks. The servers definitely keep up on refills here. We both ended up ordering the same thing: sour cream chicken tacos. We each ordered two. The tacos didn't quite look as appetizing as they actually were so I wasn't expecting it to be nearly as delicious as it was. The shells have quite a crunch to them unless you let it set for awhile to soften up. I personally loved the crunch they had. The serving of sour cream served in a side dish with each plate was HUGE. I definitely didn't expect that big of a serving of sour cream either. Lots of nice surprises. So after throwing a bunch of sour cream on my tacos and adding some salsa to give it a little more moisture and spice, I devoured those tacos like it was my last meal. Our bill ended up being around $17 for our 4 tacos total with only 1 soda (I had water), and we left with full bellies. The tacos didn't look like they'd fill me up as much as they actually did, but once I started eating, they seemed to get bigger. :P I was pretty hungry by the time we arrived, so we went through about 2 bowls of chips and about 5 servings of salsa between the two of us before we actually started on our meals. So, basically we both loved everything about our experience. The chips and salsa, sour cream chicken tacos, and amazing service gets 5 stars from me! I will definitely be back!",

NOW!\"  our little slice of heaven just happened to be about a block or so from my brothers place, so we picked him up along the way. i could hardly contain myself as we soared into Mi Patio's parking lot, my door already open before the engine was off.  i noted as we walked in it's not big or fancy, but it's cheerful, festive and warm. mom and pop type joint. you can tell by the smell, the food is going to be good.    yes, they serve $1.75 margaritas. you read that right, $1.75... my mom looked worried when she saw the gleam on my face. as you can probably guess, these cheap wonders aren't all that potent, or all that big. so i just ordered an extra shot with mine and the price was still only a few bucks more. the $2 beer specials made my dad pretty happy. the bar, already packed, seemed to be an obvious happy hour spot.  next the food. no salsa is ever hot enough for my dad. it burned my mouth pretty good, but i'm not exactly a manly man so i stuck to the milder one... my brother, dad and i all ordered the carne asada picado burro while my mom had the chicken burro. now my mom is a mere 97 lbs and rarely finishes her whole plate, so it's really a testament to this place that she almost did, or even tried. (especially since they really heap the food on) the collective response from around our table was... yummm. for the price, you're coming out way ahead. trust me.  halfway through dinner, as they seated 3 strapping phoenix police officers next to our table, i realized the quality of the food here wasn't just my imagination (or the effects of heavy tequila consumption). in my experience, anywhere you see a gaggle of local cops eating, is a sign of decent food. right?  i left there thinking, what sweltering desert? do your worst arizona! if you keep feeding me like this, i'll take on your heat any day of the week.",

    "text": "What do you know, I went back!  The owner was kind enough to email me a while back and we discussed what it was I was unhappy with, he gave me some recommendations based on my tastes, and he sent me a gift certificate to try them out again.  This time around, instead of a dismal one star rating, I find myself wavering between 3 and 4.  I will clarify that I would like to give this place 3.5 but I am rounding up because I have never had chicken as juicy as I did the other night in my entire life.  The husband and I stopped by here right after work, at about 4, and there were a handful of tables already full.  As the time progressed, it became much busier.  I would also like to report that the strong artificial cherry port-a-potty smell I picked up on last time is no longer there.  All I smelled was the food.  We seated ourselves, I glanced over the menu, and I knew what I was going to order.  Thanks to reviews from nathan and Amber, I ordered the quesapilla as an app, and for my entree, I went with the Baja Chicken Burro per the owner's suggestion.  The Quesapilla came out quickly and was already oozing cheese.  I cut it open to share and I couldn't help but stare and watch the cheese slowly fall out.  It was like porn to me.  I have an addiction to food porn.  The taste of it was fantastic.  The cheese tasted great and the crispy/soft shell around it was very nice.  The Baja Chicken Burro (a chicken burrito deep fried and then baked, then topped with cheese and cream cheese sauce) was delicious.  The outside was perfectly crisp, there was just enough cheese, and the cream cheese sauce was perfect!  I was nervous about the sauce because I am not the biggest fan of cream cheese, but this was really great.  It was slightly spicy with a really nice cooling effect because of the dairy.  The chicken was incredible.  It was so juicy and so flavorful I thought I might have a foodgasm.  I can't believe I am saying that about Mexican food, but it's True.  They know their chicken.  Overall, the food was fantastic, much better this time, but the service was okay.  It started off really strong with our drinks coming immediately after we ordered them, and subsequently our food, but after we finished we were left waiting about 20 or so minutes just to get our check.  I also couldn't help but notice while we were waiting, that this place seems to be so friendly.  The owner knew so many of the customers by name and was genuinely interested in their lives.  It was refreshing to see that kind of friendliness.  I take back my original review, it was very clearly an off day.  My husband and I very much enjoyed our food this time around.  Next time I have a taste for Mexican food (probably next cinco de mayo week) I will think about stopping by again.",

Slightly grubby inside, not big, but the food was good, the chips and salsa were AMAZING, the booze was cheap cheap cheap, (a single dollar and seventy-five cents will net you a margarita) and the service was excellent.

Our waiter had minimal formal training, there were no \"comments/suggestions\" cards, no floor managers looming over us.

The Baja Burrito comes in the most amazing cream sauce- get that dish with rice and mix it all up.

Not hing I have ever had here was nasty. This place is pretty cozy, so if your not a fan of small spots this place isn't for you. The servers? Are INCREDIBLE.

Oh oh wow your food is already come up. I'm far from an idiot and have eaten out enough you know that that was someone else's order in something with me the wrong or they change their minds. So after they know if the time was ice cold okay maybe not ice cold but it was cold enough that I could stick my fingers did I mention I that I have been sensitive hands and was able to put my fingers my beans and into the sauce. Long story short they brought me another creamy cheesy burrito thing it was okay not as good as the one I sent back having regrets hmmmmm regret sorta",

The inside of the restaurant is much better than I expected - it's super cute, absolutely decked out in themed gear, has a vibe, a bar and makes you feel like you're in Mexico. What we really weren't expecting was AMAZING SERVICE. I mean, better than most places in the Valley. Our drinks were never half empty, we had everything we needed and it was quick (without making you feel stressed out or rushed). Then, to top it off, the food was great.

Take out tacos from Mi Patio. I  arrived at the restaurant Sat 12:30, ordered 20 beef tacos and 1 veggie taco to go.  The tacos come with homemade crispy chips and tasty salsa. Each taco was filled with lots of beef, no skimping on the cheese either. The veggie taco had pinto beans, slices of avocado, lettuce topped with plenty of freshly grated cheese. They did not skimp on the avocado. Delicious! I was feeding 6 very hungry staff members and myself, they would not be disappointed. My order was completed within 12 minutes! The tacos were packaged in a large aluminum container to keep them upright, hot and easy to transport. The veggie taco was in a separate container. Thank you! The huge bag of fresh, hot and crisp chips was included, I could not stop eating them on the drive back to the event. The salsa was mild, perfect when serving to a variety of people.  Everyone was happy when I arrived with the large container filled with freshly made tacos, crispy chips and lots of salsa from Mi Patio.  I will be back, again and again.",

Restaurant ~ it's kind of smallish and cozy looking on the outside but they  really have plenty of room on the inside.  The decor is a fun Spanish style with plenty of vibrant colors and textures.  It's not fancy by any means but very fun!  Service ~ is fantastic! We've been several times and have had different servers and they are all very friendly, helpful and eager to serve to you.  Food ~ chips and salsa are excellente!  We have not had a bad meal here, everything is good!  It probably won't be the best you've ever had but they are very good and extremely consistent.  I prefer their chili relleno or their baja chicken burro or their baja spinach and feta cheese chimi!  On my last visit they combined both baja's into one pollo-spinach-cheesy-delicioso-burro!  Tasty factor times 2!  You can't go wrong with just about anything on their menu.  We try something different on every visit ;-)  Beverages ~ Skip the $2.40 soda... and go for the $1.75 margarita's!!  Yeah!! They may not be the best margaritas but where else can you get a pitcher of this tasty beverage for $9?  This is a great place to go with friends, have a good time and go el-cheap-o and not feel bad about it.  We are grateful our friends introduced us to Mi Patio Mexican Restaurant!",

    "text": "What can I say that hasn't already been said?  This place has tremendous food and will not drain your bank account. I tend to not be a big salsa fan, mainly because of the overly chunky salsa, but their salsa is just the consistency for me, and tastes great. Their enchiladas are amongst the best I've had.  The thing that gives this place even more of an edge is the service, it has to be seen to believed. Chips and salsa seldom get low before they bring out another bowl of chips, or refill your salsa. The same can be said for their drink refills. There is not a slacker to be found at this place, and even if it is packed, you can be rest assured you'll be treated with efficiency and speed with an energetic team effort.  I don't give out 5 stars easily, but this place deserves it. Not sure how \"authentic\" the food is, but I like to think I know what GOOD food is and this place has that!  P.S. Their margaritas may not have top quality ingredients but they are cheap, and tasty!",

This is the second time I have been here the last time was several years ago when we were in the area. I live in Peoria and do not get in this part of town often.  If I lived in the area I would come here more often.  This is one of the places that is small and cozy and comfortable. You feel at home. The servers and manager made sure we were well taken care of.  I will make it a priority if I am in the area to stop by.",

I order their catering for my office fairly regularly and everyone here always loves the food.  I usually get the Fiesta Mini Tray and its always a hit.  They have these mini-chimi's that are pure deep-fried deliciousness.  Also the prices are very reasonable.  This goes without saying with Mexican food, but their food is not diet friendly.  It's fried and cheesy- you'll feel 10 pounds heavier after you get done eating.  But I think it's totally worth it.",

I ordered one of the combination plates with two tacos, cheese enchilada, rice, and beans. The tacos were hard shell, like I said, not authentic but still good. We were seated as soon as we walked in, the waitress was a little brash but nice and checked on us throughout the meal. We were a party of 3 and the busser came by with two chip bowls and a salsa cup for each person. They refill your drink, chips, and salsa bowl as many times as you'd like and even after we had finished eating and were just talking the busser refilled drinks. Overall great experience and I'd definitely go back.",

    "text": "Very good Mexican Restaurant with good service.  The place was clean and very cozy small restaurant.  First let me start with the salsa and chips.  They bring you a mild sauce which is very flavorful and fresh. The mild salsa gets 5 out of 5 stars...simply awesome.  However, I also tried their spicy salsa and have to say it was a disappointment. It tasted like Tapatio jar hot sauce mixed with peppers... 1 out of 5 stars.... My recommendation is to stick with mild sauce which is actually spicy enough.    I ordered the beef enchiladas because this plate can always accurately measure the skill of the chefs in the kitchen.  The plate came with rice and beans and was good.  The meat was a little on the salty side, but the portions were great.  The rice was a little dry, but had really good flavor. The beans were sprinkled with cheese and were perfect.  The plate with two Dos Xx beers was about twenty dollars.  I would eat here again.",

I've had a ton of Mexican food in my life ranging from super authentic taco trucks in Queens to your typical Americanized strip mall joint. Unfortunately, this was honestly the worst I have ever had. There was so much cheddar cheese sprinkled on top of everything- which was clearly an attempt to replace any kind of seasoning at all. The meat in both the enchiladas and flautas we ordered was not seasoned (not even salt and pepper) and dried out, and the chips put out with the chips and salsa were completely stale. I was honestly shocked at how terrible it was. My friend and I were starving after hiking all day and super excited to get our food. When it came to the table we happily dug in and upon the first bite our startled glances met across the table as we realized what we had been served. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. I was so surprised after seeing all the great reviews on here.",

We had the #99 convo which is a cheese enchilada, a Chile relleno, a tostada, and beans and rice and we also ordered an enchilada style, green Chile beef burrito.

I did feel like our waiter was breathing down our neck and trying to rush us out a bit so that was lame but other than that it was a nice dining experience.

I always start off a first new visit to any Mexican style place with a combination meal of Enchiladas and Tacos, and this was no exception!   But first let's talk about atmosphere and service. It is very nicely decorated with plenty of tropical birds, scenic pictures, and bold colors. It has a very prominent full bar as you enter the restaurant, and appropriate Mexican festive music playing. The service here was very attentive throughout the entire meal.The salsa was excellent and the tortilla chips were crispy, freshly made and light.  As mentioned, I started with a combination meal of cheese enchiladas and a beef taco. One of the highlights that I noticed was that all of their sauces were very well made and very flavorful. Of course an excellent enchilada sauce with plenty of cheese and served to the table piping hot via a broiler / salamander that made the plate too hot to touch! Taco had plenty of very flavorful beef and was wonderfully crispy. Both beans and rice were flavorful and spiced perfectly. I would recommend everything about this place!",

Our visit started with complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were fresh and salted just right and the salsa was great. The staff kept the chips and salsa flowing throughout the entire meal. Speaking of staff, they were attentive and very efficient. Now for our meals and the real winners, we had their regular specialities, the Baja Chicken Burro (supplemented beef instead) and the Patio Beef Chimi. The deep fried burro was full of meat and lathered in their Baja cream sauce and served with rice. Dang good!!! The Patio Beef Chimi was also full to the brim with beef and lathered in their Fresh Green Tomatillo Sauce and served with rice. Also dang good!!!! Overall, a great sit down Mexican food restaurant with wonderful customer service. High recommend restaurant the the dishes mentioned.",

The waiter came with our food after awhile and practically threw our food on the table, spilling salsa. Waiter didn't even offer to clean it up or apologized. He went to next table and came back when it was time to pay the bill. Otherwise we hadn't seen him other than taking our orders  dropping our food off. He was so rude, clearly hating his home. He treated us like we were bothering him. Anyways terrible service. The food was just \"ok\" so won't be back. We didn't tip for this bad behavior but wrote a note to let manager know of the his. There's plenty of Mexican joints in local Phoenix.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I must update my review based on my most recent dining experience at Mi Patio.  The BF and I stopped in on a Saturday night for a late dinner right before closing.  I have a cast-iron stomach and I almost never have problems with anything I eat.    I ordered the taco salad with beef machaca.  When it arrived, the beef was cold and I only ate two bites as a result.  I surmise the beef had been left out to cool (probably for too long) since the restaurant was about to close.  Needless to say, a few short hours later in the middle of the night I came down with the worst case of food poisoning I have ever experienced.  This wasn't \"Oh, I don't feel so good\" food poisoning.  This was, \"Should I go to the hospital?\" food poisoning.  It was so bad I was unable to travel for work the following week.    Mi Patio is now permanently off my list of acceptable eateries; it's just not worth the risk.  Adios, Mi Patio!",

    "text": "Mi Patio is a clean and casual family-owned restaurant in central Phoenix. Mi Patio is unique to any other Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix metropolitan area as the cuisine is Mexican with a Greek influence to some of their dishes.   Mi Patio is also distinguished from other Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area because it FEELS like it's family owned. More often than not one of either of owners will personally inquire about your dining experience.  I've never had anything but great food at Mi Patio and although most Mexican restaurants are generous with their portions Mi Patio is extremely generous. You won't leave Mi Patio hungry.  It's hard for me to pick the best item on the menu but I'm fond of the Mexican pizza and the Greek-Mex salads.  And although this is a very clean family atmosphere it also has a great bar. The bar is short and in the front of the restaurant but it feels like the neighborhood bar where you know the names of everyone sitting there before you finish your first drink. Like many of their customers you may have first heard about the business from word-of-mouth. They serve great margaritas for $2.00. :-)  Mi Patio is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix and I stop in whenever I can. And a lot of times when I don't have the time to eat there I get food to go (their to-go menu is really inexpensive - something like $4.95 for a two taco plate with rice and beans.)  Check it out!",

That said, fellow Yelpers, DO be responsible when imbibing upon Mi Patio's spenderiferous drinks.  Now that all said--Mi Patio also has some of the best chips and salsa in town to boot!! Combine all that with the fab Mexican fare, fast and friendly service [no, dear, I DON'T mean cervezas, although their beer is ice cold too!] and homey barrio decor and you've got a fiver on your hands.  And now for the piece de resistance [or whatever the heck the French spell i out!]--there is a little tiny little patio out back now for the smokers.

You cannot beat the $3 Margarita specials so my friend and I ordered two glasses each. To top it off, our waiter gave us Kamikaze shots on the house. Such a cute kid he was. How beautful is that?   While waiting for my  huge-ass veggie burrito, I discovered that  tortilla chips and home made salsa went absolutely well with my margarita! Another good marriage,  I say.

The first time we went with my sister in law because she was visiting from out of town and heard great things about this place. Also didn't hurt that it was close to my home. We walked in and we were seated quickly, the sever took our drink orders and before we even had time to look at the menu he asked if we were ready to order, obviously not we just sat down. About a minute goes by and the sever comes back to take our order. At this point I'm frustrated so we just give him our order. The food was done in less than ten minutes, which I wasn't complaining about. A few bites in and the sever comes back to ask if we were ready for the check. Now at this point everyone is upset. The whole time we were there it almost felt like they were trying to rush us out. We were in the restaurant for a total of 20-30 minutes , and the food was sub-par for Mexican food too. I feel like when you decide to go out for food you pay for the atmosphere and service. We could have gone to Filibertos to pay less and have better quality food.   We decided that perhaps the last visit had to do with a server \"having a bad day\" so we decided to give them another chance. Unfortunately, the same thing happened. We felt very rushed and unwelcome. In the middle of our dinner an older gentleman  asked if we needed \"to go boxes\", we said \"no\" at that time because we were not ready to leave. About 10 minutes later and feeling very irritated and rushed we decided we did need boxes for our food so we asked. The older man throws his hands in the air and tells another employee \"I just asked them if they wanted boxes\" (in spanish). We walked out of there with a bad taste in our mouth and it wasn't from the food. I would never recommend this restaurant to anybody, ever!",

Chips and salsa were pretty good as well. Our waiter brought us a complimentary shot towards the end of the meal that had tequila in it and was similar to a mini margarita.   The bad: The service. I asked for a margarita glass with no salt that never came. We were asked if we wanted another pitcher of margaritas and we said maybe in a bit and as we were finishing our meals he just dropped one off at our table which we didn't really want at that point in the meal. They advertise a $2 margarita but it is so small and has so much ice it isn't much bang for your buck. We ended up getting a pitcher and they were tasty but extremely weak.   I will be back since it is close to the house and the food was good, I just hope that the server pays a bit more attention.",

I should have know when the guy working the front took a call on the phone and he didnt know what \"pork carnitas\" are. He had to ask somebody if they offer pork carnitas because he's never heard of that? Weird.  The food took a long time to come out and wasn't good when it arrived. There was a hard chunk of old chicken in one of my kids taquitos which was inedible. I was going to say something and send it back but I just wanted to get out of that place.",

I was there for lunch and when I was leaving I told the staff I'd be back in 4 hours for dinner as a joke lol. I didn't come back that night but came back the very next day and omg so damn good. Had the carne asada plate with enchilada combo the first day and second day had taco, enchilada and chile Relleno combo, soooo good. Thank you Mi Patio for the great food and service.

Now that we live in the east valley, we don't venture to that area, which is a shame because Mi Patio always delivers a good meal.  They have great salsa that is both chunky and saucy.  Their chips are crispy and not greasy.  I'm not sure if the server forgot to give them to us, but she didn't give us straws with our water.  I appreciate that because they are totally useless and just create plastic waste.   I ordered the 2 taco platter with shredded chicken and shredded beef.  The taco shells were super crispy.  I am a big fan of their shredded cheese.  It looks like it was shredded in the kitchen by hand.  I also enjoy how they mix lettuce with cabbage on the tacos.  It's just more hearty and doesn't wilt against the hot meat.  Hubby's fajitas were a little salty and he wished they would have come with many small tortillas and not just one large one.  The juevos rancheros was cheesy and delicious.  If you're looking for a good meal that is consistently tasty every time, this place will hit the spot.",

Giving it a three star because:  Chips- stale, except for last bowl that was given which was crispy and fresh.  Guacamole- tasted like mashed avocados without the trimmings. It lacked taste- no ingredients that would make it a guacamole.   Carnitas- the pork wasn't marinated, lacked seasoning hence had no taste. Also the dish was supposed to have pico de Gallo but didn't come with it.   Steak fajitas- as with the pork, lacked marinade, and was dry. Good thing it came with beans, rice, and guacamole.  Spinach enchilada with white cream- too salty and mushy. I felt like I was eating pureed food.   Skip the resto- I'm sure there's other Mexican restaurants better out here.",

We got free shots, delicious salsa, warm chips and the entree was decent. However, as I continued to go there the service seemed to get worse. The last time was most upsetting and made me decide to never return.  We actually had to hunt down our waiter to take our order because he was taking so long to come back. He was busy watching the ball game and socializing with 2 other people up at the bar. We were pretty convinced that our waiter was high. He had absolutely no perception of time, he was sweating, loud and his pupils were ginormous. The chips seemed to be burned from the heat lamps and the chips that were not burned tasted a bit stale.  When we got our entree the ends of my enchilada were hot but the middle was cold. That leads me to believe that it was previously frozen and it actually tasted like frozen food. My boyfriend's food tasted like Franks Red Hot. Don't get me wrong, we love franks but I don't expect it to be the sauce they use to flavor their food.  The margaritas are good but cheap for a reason! They are hoping that you drink enough to cover up the taste of the food. If you decide to go just hope that it's a good day. For me, I can't bare to chance it.",

My wife ordered the small margarita, two enchiladas, one chicken and one beef with rice and beans.  They were rated as having the best pitcher margaritas in town and I can see why.  Most notable, though, was the service, which was very attentive.  Both of the ladies serving us were really really nice and made sure everything was right.  The restaurant is a family-owned style place on a busy corner in north central Phoenix.  When you pull up, it looks small, but it really has quite a bit of capacity and they know how to serve up the food and drink.  All at a reasonable cost, especially the margaritas!  I was very impressed.  I sure wish we had a great place like this at home.  When I am in Phoenix, I'll be back.",

If your bowl of chips look even half empty, you can bet there will be a spinning bowl of fresh chips on the table before you even know it. I always order the Baja Spinach & Feta Cheese Chimi, and so should you. They also (somehow) know when you're celebrating. So when you're handed two pink shots you didn't order called Mexican Koo-laid, don't be scarred. Just suck it down and order another margarita.",

If you're not really hungry you can get something simple like soup or plain tortillas wth beans. If you're starving order a Mexi-pizza.  Each stereotypical mexican entree comes heaping with beans, rice and lettuce- so you will have a plateful of food.   SERVICE Chips, drinks, and salsa arrive at the table almost before you do. Drinks are always promptly refilled. They never complain if they have to split a check.   OTHER The only reason they don't get 4 stars is because they aren't high quality Mexican food- more like a step up from fast food. The tables and chairs are also very tightly packed into the establishment.",

I cannot really give it anything about a 3 because I have been to places that have better food and just an all around better feel.  Mi Patio isnt bad by all means but it is just ok!  I had the tamale plate, which came with a red chile tamale, rice and beans.  The beans were great!  The rice was little to be desired, very hard and had no real flavor to it.  The tamale wasnt bad.  The flavor was good but the bulk of it as masa.  I like a tamale with a lot of meat inside and the tamale was about 5% meat and 95% masa!  The guest I took liked their plates so all in all it was a good experience.  I received a lot more recommendation for mexican food that I am going to try!  As of now I am on a mission to find an authentic, good mexican restaurant in Phoenix...Yelp does it exist?",

We drove by this place a million times and always said \"someday\". That day finally came. And now we crave it all the time!  Punctual servers, friendly staff, the endless supply of chips and delicious house made salsa that flow like water... That's just the start!  My wife loves Carne Asada, and in my opinion, Mi Patio's is better than all the joints that claim \"Phoenix's best\"! Not to mention the burro is the size of a small pillow and served with your choice of rice or beans!  I got the Red Chile beef burro on our last visit, and was feelin kind of wild so I upgraded to \"enchilada\" style... I wish that I hadn't bc the red chile sauce was incredible just on its own!!   The best part is: I want to try something different every time I go here to eat! EVERYTHING looks amazing and Mi Patio hasn't let me down yet!",

    "text": "This place is ok.  Been here once and just don't understand the great reviews.  It's not terrible.  It's mediocre.  I've had their vegetarian burrito, and it was good.  Not great, but good.  I guess I expect a restaurant to be great when the reviews overall are above a 4.  It makes me wonder what I'm missing.  My husband had their chicken taco and didn't like it because the chicken was in breaded nuggets/strips.  I doubt anyone expects a chicken taco to have breaded chicken it.  He sure didn't, and he really didn't like it.  His tastebuds are pretty easy to please when it comes to basic stuff like this, and he didn't even like it.  I also had the Caribbean Martini and it was great.  The ONLY downside to it was that it wasn't filled to the top.  It literally was filled a full inch from the top. No exaggeration.  Since it was happy hour and cheap (I think it cost around $2), I didn't complain.  It tasted great, though!  I think the key thing this place has going for it is its central location.  It's easy to get to, and has a big parking lot.  If you want really good Mexican go to Los Dos Molinos (not super vegetarian friendly, but a few options -- meat eaters and lovers of spice will especially like it here).  If it's just tacos you're after, go to Two Hippies, and if you really want to mix (or confuse) your palate in a fun way, head over to Chino Bandito for a Mexican/Asian combined menu.",

    "text": "Probably need to go back and try something else. My experience was a good one, and the service was perfect, but I normally rate on food, and it just wasn't all there for me.   We were greeted as soon as we walked through the door, placed at a table where we decided we'd take the bar seats that were open. They had no problems with this, not even a dirty look, that sometimes comes with it. You can definitely tell the staff has some bonds, not sure if it's family or just real good employer employee relationships. Needless to say, I love being lead to believe the workers actually like what their doing. The guy sitting at the bar next to me was obviously a regular, and while we didn't talk much, he was very friendly, and stated that everything was good.   The salsa was fresh, mild, but Can we say salt? Still had a good hint of lime that I enjoyed. The bright side of this was the chips needed no extra salt, it came in the salsa. The chips were deelish! Freshly made and perfect. For my meal, which came out so fast,  I chose the Carne Asada.  It was a plate of Carne Asada steaks, rice, beans, lettuce, and some pico.  Everything was real good, but the meat was too salty.  On that note, let me just tell you that I LOVE SALT, like I'm guilty of sprinkling it on my pizza (i know thats so bad), so maybe it was just my taste buds that day!  I washed this all down with an ice cold Tecate Light in a can, yup that's right!  I like cans, I'm just weird like that.  The bartender asked if I wanted a mug, so if you don't like cans, don't worry!  My BF had the frybread tostada thingy, I can't remember the name, but it was like an gigantic tostada on top of a fry bread with green chilli beef, lettuce, tons of cheese.  I tasted it and was very happy with it, it was like striped cubed beef, not shreeded.  It was good, we probably should have split it, it was huge.    I'll be back to check some other things out, I'll be sure an update accordingly.",

However, right when you walk in you know Mi Patio has to be good by all the regulars hanging out at the bar.   We ordered 2 of the $1.75 margarita specials. What a great deal- they are this price every day at every hour. They aren't top shelf but go oh so nicely with chips n salsa. The chips were my favorite thing from the whole meal. They're super fresh and irresistible plus our server kept refilling our bowl so it was hard to say no.   I ordered a chicken burro enchilada style with rice and my fiance had a red chili beef chimichanga with beans. Everything was delicious and the staff was very attentive. The portions were huge and the prices are very reasonable (our total was under $22!!)  We'll definitely be back! The menu has so many tasty things to try and the chips n salsa combined with the margarita can be addictive!!",

I have to say I was almost a little disappointed upon arriving to find that it is a fairly nice restaurant, not the hole-in-wall, don't look under the table, in the window sills, and especially the kitchen, kind of place that we all know have the BEST food.  And with a nicer store front usually comes a higher price tag.  Mi Patio is no different.  Combination plates are in the $10 range.  Kind of expensive for Mexican food in my opinion.  Perhaps I'm still living in 1978.  In spite of that, we were seated and introduced to their chips and salsa.  The chips, unfortunately, were cold.  Had they been hot, they would have been the thin and crispy tortilla chips I love.  But the salsa was really really really good.  Because my husband and I have vowed to eat less in 2010, we shared a meal, an appetizer in fact.  Unfortunately, it was the $17 appetizer supreme that would have fed half of Mexico.  A pizza-sized platter filled with mini chimis, flautas, red chile nachos, and gyro slices (I thought that was odd, but my husband loved them).  We had wonderful service with two people making sure our drinks were kept filled.  The sampler had enough variety for me to learn I will happily make the trek back to \"the avenues\" for Mi Patio again.",

The service was impeccable- chips and salsa brought out right away and replenished as often as needed. I am a salsa fanatic so I loved the fact that they refilled my salsa without it even being totally empty- thats amazing!!  We started with a cheese quesadilla, because whats better than melted cheese on a tortilla? And I tried a margarita on the rocks and really liked the taste of it.  Maybe not the strongest thing, but at least it wasn't loaded with sweet n sour mix. Blech!  We had all but decided what to order when we found out the menu had another side to it- so many choices! I went with a combo plate with a chile relleno, cheese enchilada, beef taco and rice n beans. It was a feast! Everything was wonderful, even the rice. I liked that the chile relleno wasn't battered and fried but simply wrapped in a corn tortilla and stuffed with gooey white cheese. JD had the chicken burro because of the reputation it had earned from other Yelpers and he was very happy with his choice. The burrito had moist, flavorful chunks of chicken that tasted incredible.  We were also totally impressed with the prices! This place is cheap and doesn't skimp at all on food, salsa or service! I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "The guy working the front desk at the Holiday Inn at which I'm staying recommended this place, and given that it was only about a 10-minute walk and I had a hankering for authentic, nonchain Mexican food, I thought I would give it a whirl.  I'm glad I did.  It's a structure that looks small on the outside but is fairly large on the inside, at least to my eye. Yet it still gives off a very friendly, cozy vibe, if not an oppressive one.   Plastic parrot ornaments, most decorated in colors not seen in real parrots (says this person who is owned by two birds) and parrot paintings serve as the primary decorations. What's not to like?  I was worried that the place would be freezing, given the 85-degree heat of the daytime (it had since cooled to about the low 60s), but I needn't have been. It wasn't chilly at all, much to my delight.  I was seated promptly in the busy dining room by a man who was busily bopping to and fro. As such, he didn't say much to me and kind of threw the menu down on the table and hustled away.   That's one of only two complaints (the other one in a minute): He seated me in a somewhat darkened area of the floor, perhaps not noticing I had a book with me. (Honestly, there was only one other two-top available, adjacent to mine, in the area where he led me, and the lighting wouldn't have been any better over that table, either. It looked as if there were better-lighted tables he could have put me at in the room in the back and to the right, but I wasn't that upset about it, so I let it go.)  Other reviewers have mentioned how prompt the busboys are with the refills of chips and salsa and water and soda, and I read them and kind of took them with a large grain of salt. But I was amazed to see it in action; I had barely gotten down to the crumbs in one bowl of chips before the busboy was coming over with a fresh bowl; he plopped that down on the old bowl. The chips were warm and held salt very well. So addictive.   A few seconds later, he came by with a plastic Thermos full of salsa and unloaded into my salsa dish, thus topping it off. Sodas and waters were refilled before I even knew they were depleted. On the whole, it's got to be some of the best customer service I've ever experienced.  My other complaint: My request to build a custom vegetarian quesadilla--or to remove the mushrooms from the mushroom-zucchini-eggplant enchilada--was denied. It's an odd discordant note on a restaurant that clearly seems to pride itself on doing what the customer wants. (I didn't ask for anything exotic in the custom veggie quesadilla, just broccoli, zucchini, and carrots. The waiter, whom I still tipped 20 percent, said the kitchen didn't have broccoli or carrots. Say what? Whatever. I ordered the mushroom-zucchini-eggplant enchilada, single version as opposed to double version.)  The food (there was plenty of it) came out fairly quickly and was hot. Honestly, I couldn't distinguish the mushrooms, so I just ate everything. I was glad I didn't order the double enchilada; I wouldn't have been able to finish the second one.  All this for an eye-poppingly low price of $10.88? With free refills on the soft drinks? Are you kidding me?   Go. Bring your appetite. You won't leave with it.",

After seeing so many positive reviews & recs on the place I knew I had to come back & refresh my memory of Mi Patio.   My dad & I came here for lunch this past Wednesday around noon. The parking lot was packed, that's always a good sign! I have to agree with Rand H, that the restaurant does have an odd shape to it. We were seated at a table that had a chair on one side & a booth on the other, I sat at the booth spot. Our table was kinda wobbly, definitely needed to stick a book or something under the table leg.   Chips & salsa were immediately brought out & soon after came our drink orders. The chips & salsa were pretty damn good & our server was very on top of refills. For our entrees: my dad ordered a bean & cheese burro & I ordered the baja spinach & feta cheese chimi, both came with a side of rice. Dad enjoyed his burro & ate about 3/4 of it, he didn't eat the rice though because he's more of a beans guys & is watching his carbs. I also enjoyed my chimi, very unique flavors, the rice was yummy & I finished it all. I had about half of my chimi left so I took it home to hubby, along with the rest of my dad's burro & his rice. Hubby said chimi was ok, rice was good & burro was his fav.   My next visit will for sure be sooner than a few years!",

My combo plate was smothered in sauce and cheese so everything pretty much tasted the same. The enchilada was ok, but nothing spectacular. The shredded beef taco was pretty good. The chile relleno... not so much. The batter was so eggy it was like they made an omelette and wrapped it around the chile. There was more egg/batter than chile, which is unfortunate. The homemade horchata was the best part of the meal. It was almost like a horchata slushie.   We went for a date night in the middle of the week, and the one comment my partner made as we were getting ready to leave was \"Next time, we go somewhere quiet for date night.\" Blah.

Not really down-home mexican, more like down-home chicano, but still delicious in it's own right. The eggplant enchiladas are pretty good, but they have this light chicken burro plate with cabbage and celery and a really good peppery vinaigrette, that I discovered I preferred without the tortilla, and this is my staple when I visit Mi Patio. This is a really great place to get tipsy and fed with friends if you happen to live walking distance.... the waiter bought my friend and I a shot after one or two of our meals.... I guess he knew I would tip him for it! :-)  This place is always nice and cool on a hot summer day.  This kind of private business should stay in business.

This small, local Mexican restaurant has the nicest (most efficient) staff who are quick to refill your glass, grab you another margarita, and dish out those warm, crispy house-made chips and salsa. The chips and salsa alone are addicting, but their rice and beans (that thankfully don't taste like they're from a can) and their cheesy-but-festive decor, friendly staff, and very local feel keep people coming. Ample free parking and the occasional table to table mariachi band? Count me in. I never get soft drinks here, but their freshly blended Horchata is AMAZING and is probably my favorite horchata in AZ.",

    "text": "Feb 22 - Adjust to 5 stars.  We have now ordered take out several times from this place and it is yummy.  On top of it, the staff are so incredibly friendly to my husband and daughter.  Top notch service and food deserve 5 stars.   All of these years living down the street we never went in because we thought it was a bar. We turned to Yelp for a carryout place and saw the reviews. My hubbie and I were pleasantly surprised. We placed the order and it was ready in ten minutes. The food came home piping hot. Salsa and chips were yummy. I had a chicken chimichanga smothered in guacamole and sour cream. The chicken in the chimichanga burrito consisted of all white meat - moist and flavorful.   My husband had a combo plate - an enchilada, relleno, rice, beans and beef taco. I think the relleno was wrapped in a corn tortilla, not the traditional egg batter. It was a bit strange.  The green chili itself was flavorful. Being from NM, I am used to a red sauce being made from red chili powder. I could not quite distinguish what the sauce was made from that covered the enchilada.    All in all the food was quite tasty and reasonable for the amount of food we received. On top of it the service both over the phone and on site were great. My husband said the place was packed when he stopped by around 6:30 pm.",

I would pay more if I could have alcohol in my margarita. They should really change their sign to $1.75 lemonades.   I do have to say that they have really good chips and salsa. The chips where broken and I had to fish around my bowl to find a full chip but when I did, it was perfect with the fresh, spicy salsa.   Since I wasn't that hungry, my brother and I decided to just get munchies so we opted for the Supreme Appetizer ($18) which was a giant platter of lettuce, mini chimis, rolled flautas and a machaca salad in the middle. Honestly, I couldn't recognize anything but the flautas. It looked like a salad. The rolled tacos tasted like it was fried in warm oil because it was stale and not crunchy but the meat was good if that counts for anything.  I should have went across the street to the 24 hour Mexican food joint.",

    "text": "Mi Patio has long been one of my favorite places for Mexican food.  Why you may ask?  Well I first started going there long ago when the margaritas were $1.25...now they are $1.75 but you can still go drink all day for cheap...keep in mind these ARE $1.75 margaritas, so it may take you a few to get your buzz on!   What keeps me coming back though is the food, the price, and the service.    First of all the food and the price:  Is it going to win any awards for being the top notch mexican place in the Valley?  Probably not, but it's pretty darn good and better than dreadful old Macayo's or any of the other big chains.  And the value is excellent too!  For $22 two people can fill up on endless chips and salsa, enjoy a full plate dinner each, along with 2 drinks and fried ice cream for dessert!  My favorite is the Spinach Enchalada...anything there with the Baja sauce is mucho bueno!!  As for the service, I'm a big fan of small mom and pop type businesses, and I try to support them whenever I can.  I've been going to Mi Patio for about 9 years now and the same people working there today are the same people who were serving me way back when.  The owner is always friendly whenever he is there just hanging out and chatting with you, and its neat to see the same young men grow from bus boys to servers.  To me this says the employees are happy and treated well, and thats the kind of business I like to support!  The ambiance of Mi Patio is very colorful, and family friendly.  There is a bar, along with a smoking and non-smoking section.  It is usually pretty busy around the dinner hour no matter what day of the week, but I have never gone there and had to wait long for a table, if at all.    If you are looking for a quiet romantic sort of place, keep looking because once this place fills up it starts rockin!",

The Guacamole Beef taco is to die for, the Albondigas soup will put your Grandmother to shame, the Margaritas are a party, and the chips and salsa are, in my opinion, the best in town - the chips are light and fresh - most of the time warm - and the salsa is the perfect combo of flavor and heat.",

Thursday evening was very busy but we were seated immediately and there were a few empty tables that filled quickly...if waiting is a concern, you may want to call and check in advance.  So, we have determined that this place is popular and here's why:  Very diverse menu of Mexican and North American food...emphasis on Mexican, large portions, cooked fresh and served hot, friendly and efficient servers and staff, wonderful atmosphere with lots of odd bits and pieces for decoration, good people watching too.  This reminded me of our favorite place in Santa Fe with an Arizona tilt. We both ordered a burro plate and almost finished them...major portions, very tasty, very well prepared...we might have been better off had we skipped lunch.  We will be back next time we're in Phoenix.   Spoke with the manager and two staffers, asked questions, got good straight answers...Mi Patio has been around for along time, it's a well established local \"go to\" place. Well accepted menu. Agreeable atmosphere, friendly staff, no rough edges. Reliable resource is the idea that comes to mind.  If you like good Mexican food, you should try this one. Bring your best appetite and not too much money...not cheap but I'll bet you can't eat enough to hurt your food budget.",

The obligatory chips and salsa were delivered with chips in a bowl but each of us received our own salsa bowl.  The salsa was as excellent as I remember it.  We ordered our lunch (2 guacamole beef tacos).  Each time our salsa or chips neared empty it was refilled.  Same with our beverages.    When the food arrived, it was hot with generous portions.  I was able to finish the entire lunch entree but left feeling very satisfied.  The folks here are friendly, offer fast service and the portions generous.  Make it a plan to stop in for lunch when you're in the area.  You won't be disappointed.",

Sadly people these days have gone to the extreme with bringing their  pets into restaurants, grocery, department stores under the guise of \"emotional support\". I understand people have anxieties, etc.    But in the past ONLY service dogs were allowed now all someone has to say is emotional support, etc.     Sure I'm a dog owner & yes my dog gives me comfort but I'm no way is she a True Service dog.

The salsa is delicious and you each get your own, and they are always keeping it and your drinks full. Chips are thin and hot, but you can get full on those fast because they keep that full too! Really good tacos but I'm pretty partial to the Baja chicken burro. I like the taco salad here too because the shreds are lettuce and green cabbage. Not great for the lactose intolerant, because lots of delicious cheese on everything. They will happily leave it off if you ask, but why would you? I've done that for dietary reasons before, but prefer with cheese. Tiny ass parking lot but plenty of tables so you don't usually have to wait. Decorated with lots of tropical birds, because you know when you think of Mexican food you immediately think of tucans and parrots, right? It's been in that same spot for ages, like probably longer than many of you have been alive. The house margs are good. Prices are good. Can't say a bad thing about the place, loud usually but that's ok. Just don't go there hoping for a quiet dinner really. I live nowhere near here so if I'm in the area, I love eating here.",

The salsa is some of the best around, but my secret trick is it mix it with some of their red hot sauce (you have to ask for it!) to give it that extra punch! I could eat their chips and salsas as a whole meal.  For being a more traditional Mexican joint, Mi Patio has fantastic vegetarian options (but beware of the rice!) and some quirky Greek food thrown in. The price to portion ratio is very fair and $9 will get me enough food for 2 meals. The service here is VERY quick - you can be and out in 45 minutes.",

First of all, this place has too much going on therefore very noisy.   I ordered the #96 combo. Two beef tacos, rice and beans. The rice not only looked as old as the moon but tasted awful. The beans were tasteless as well. The shredded beef in the taco was so greasy....it dripped, needed to be cooked with some spices to help it taste like something.  My husband had the red chile burro, again, no flavor what so ever.  The complimentary chips and salsa were just as bad. The over powering of cilantro trying to cover up jared salsa??? The chips reminded me of store bought, not even served warm.  I didn't think it was possible to screw up Mexican food, how wrong am I!  Our waiter didn't bother to check on how we were doing once the food was served. Just as well, he would of gotten an earful. This place is for Gringos who don't know any better about authentic Mexican food. But.... if you like to drink Margaritas, then for $1.99 a glass you can have a few, get drunk and think the food was great!",

The portions are still generous, but the rice is dry and the entrees are often not seasoned properly - they come out too salty or tasteless. And I wish the margaritas had some alcohol; if there's any, it's almost undetectable - so no wonder they are inexpensive.

We live in Tucson but go to Phoenix quite frequently because our son lives there so we try new restaurants there as well.  This place has an unusual twist as it is certainly Mexican but with the Greek influence.  My first impression when we walked in was it seemed clean, warm and extremely friendly.  The service was super.  Three people and three bowls of chips and yummy salsa for each of us.  The chips were warm and obviously home made.  The menu is outstanding and interesting choices.  I had the carne asada which had  a hint of lemon and gave it the flavor of a gyro.  My hubby ordered Eggplant enchilladas and he loved it.  Good prices, great service, and best of all cheap Margaritas.  $1.75 all day any time. A little weak but that was OK.  I'll certainly return to try more of the offerings.",

But if you want delicious, quality food for a reasonable price, look no further than Mi Patio!  Located, literally, on the corner of 7th Avenue & Osborn this Mexican restaurant has great salsa, which I believe is very important to any chips & salsa lover. Whether you want a mild Pico de Gallo or a more spicy salsa, they have both!  My boyfriend & I dine here frequently. We both get two shredded beef tacos- They consistently have generous portions of beef, lettuce and cheese that will fill you right up. I always order mine with a side of guacamole and it is a perfect addition to my order.  Although some may argue that the decor is somewhat cheesy, I like it. The restaurant appears fun & that is exactly what I am looking for in a Mexican restaurant. Also, every staff member I have interacted with is extremely friendly & helpful! They are always attentive when it comes to refilling our chip bowl, salsa & drinks.  Overall, if you are looking for both, quality AND quantity Mexican food- Give Mi Patio a try! You will be glad you did!!",

This place is pretty dive-y and at first glance, you'd think \"Meh..nothing to write home about\". Don't judge a book by it's cover! Mi Patio serves up classic Mexican fare with a Greek twist. The first time I got the complimentary chips and salsa, I was sold-AND might I mention that it's bottomless? We'd be halfway finished with a bowl of chips and someone would be making rounds to give us more! The margaritas are pretty standard-I'm not a huge margarita drinker but I always order one when I come here-why not? It's only $1.75. I know what you're thinking. Hold the phone! 1.75? Was it Happy Hour? NOPE..It's all the time!   Usually when I go, I've ordered the veggie burro. On my most recent visit, the special was fish tacos.. This girl is a huge fan of those! The portions here are huge-especially with the burros. I usually power halfway through because it's so good I can't stop eating and then am stuffed.  They seem to make the food at record pace and all of the ingredients taste fresh. The fish tacos I ordered were SO tasty-I had never had them with fresh taco shells..mmm mm good!! Plus the beans and rice which is always delicious. I'd probably eat here every day if I could..or if it were particularly healthy.",

Rice and beans were delicious too.  I have already sent a couple of families to try it out & one friend even had it catered at her baby shower!  2. AMAZING Service- Our server was great!  Helpful, kind, and provided top notch service without being intrusive on our meal!  3. Wonderful Experience- ambiance was as expected.  Comfortable seating and decorations were Mexican themed with Halloween decorations (It's October) that my toddler loved.  The service, food, and employees were all great!!  And the bathrooms were clean (this is super important, in my opinion).  We will definitely come back regularly.",

My daughter orders some shredded beef tacos. Our waiter was very attentive and just as friendly as the hostess. Our drinks were never empty and our chips were filled the second they got low. The food came out so fast and I was so surprised. It looked and smelled fabulous! The first bite to the last was amazing. My daughter said her tacos were the most flavorful and juicy she's ever had.

The restaurant may not be  much to look at from the outside, however it's definitely worth going in.  Your greeted the moment you walk in the door by staff that are very friendly and inviting.  Once seated you are immediately served a large bowl of warm chips and salsa.  The chips and salsa at Mi Patio Mexican Grill are  fresh and so addicting. What I liked best is  each person gets their own bowl of salsa, so double dip all you want and believe me you will want to.  The salsa at Mi Patio is the best I've had in a very long time.  The portions at Mi Patio are huge. I ordered a taco and enchilada combination plate  and could not finish my entree. I haven't found a cheese enchilada any where near this good.   Price are reasonable and service excellent.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that enjoys mexican food.",

I ordered the vegetarian burro and my husband ordered two enchiladas, one cheese and one chicken in red sauce. We also ordered guac and green enchilada sauce on the side to taste. All their enchilada sauce are the best I've ever tasted, really good depth of flavor, and their guac was simple but yummy. I am so happy I found a place that has something for vegetarians/ vegans to eat. My burro had beans, rice, guac, lettuce/cabbage mix, onions, cilantro, and pico. It was HUGE and it was delicious! It was supposed to come with cheese, but I ordered it without (lactose intolerant!).   Overall great atmosphere, great service, and yummy food! Their claim to fame is their $2ish dollar house margaritas, which I didn't sample, but plenty of other people were ordering them!   Parking lot is pretty tiny, normal for Phoenix, so come after the dinner rush (7ish) and it should be emptying out, or go for an early dinner! Would highly recommend, and of you have a vegan/vegetarian friend and have no clue where to take them, now you do and a menu item to recommend!",

Not authentic Mexican food, but great for when you're looking for something better than Berto's. Their portions are large and between their baja burrito and their patio chimi there's no going wrong.   They're not exactly packed with natural flavor but their sauces are quite good. They will fall short if you're looking for spice, even Berto's has hotter red sauce but if you're looking for something like Macayo's then you'll be pleasantly surprised.   They offer quick take out, or you can dine in and partake their incredible cheap margaritas. I've also heard they have a phenomenal happy hour. There's plenty of parking, and a large dining area, but it does get pretty packed for that happy hour. I love that they're open late and include chips even for take out!  The laat time we dined in the owner gave my boyfriend and I two complimentary shots as well, so this place definitely gets a thumbs up in my opinion.",

The chicken Baja burrito was drenched in an amazing white sauce.  We also got a plate with shredded beef tacos and a cheese enchilada. Both were perfection.  Best red enchilada sauce I think I've had.. as well as the rice! I'm not sure I've ever had such moist and flavorful Mexican rice?!! You actually want to finish it all off your plate.

    "text": "I entered Mi Patio looking to have an awesome Mexican lunch and I left Mi Patio wondering what I just ate.  The options are generic Mexican dishes,  flautas, tacos, burritos, quesadillas, etc.  Being a simple menu with high ratings I figured the food would be spot on.  I placed my order; fish flautas and a jamaica.  Unfortunately they do not serve jamaica so that was substituted with water.        While I waited a bowl of chips and salsa were brought over.  The chips were nice and thin, kinda that classic restaurant style but the salsa was very watery, mild in flavor, and not very appealing.  The wait for my food was quite long for such a simple meal but it did eventually show up, and to my surprise it wasn't  exactly \"good\".      The flautas were extremely dry, the fish was very much overcooked and almost as dry as the tortilla.  The \"pesto\" was bland and added nothing to the dish, it was more a gimmick than flavor and it made absolutely no sense to have it there.  The rice was seasoned so heavily with oregano that I couldn't taste anything else after having some the best part of the meal had to be the beans, because they were simply that, just beans.      I have to say \"disappointment\" is the only word to describe this place.  It's no better than a Mexican fast food restaurant and in fact is a bit worse considering the long wait for food, the only real difference is the liquor license.  There are much better options in the vicinity so unless it's you're only option take a hard pass.",

    "text": "Came here on a Saturday night a little after 9:30pm.   Was visiting Phoenix for the weekend from out of state and turned to yelp for help on suggestions on a late night dinner.  Mi Patio's 4 star rating and proximity to my location made this restaurant an easy pick.  However, shortly after sitting down we where told that the kitchen would be closing in 10 minutes. Perhaps that was the reason for the quality of the food we received.  I ordered the machaca chimi with beans in the side.  This dish was not bad, but not great.  My friend ordered beef tacos and rice.  The beef was flavorless and somewhat tough, and the rice ------- was horrible!  It tasted burnt and funky.  That dish was a complete fail.  I ordered the $2.79 margaritas since they proudly advertise this special via a banner outside the restaurant.  This was a very disappointing - all I had was sugar and no alcohol, a complete waste of money.  I didn't even finish it.  Perhaps it was the fact that we arrived near closing or maybe this is what their food really is like.  I find the rating for this establishment completely deceiving - an epic fail.  I would not recommend this place at this point.  I wish I could suggest a different place to grab some delicious and outstanding Mexican food, but since I'm not from Phoenix  and was visiting on a whim - I cannot.",

Our carne asada tasted like it had been defrosted in the microwave right after we ordered it.  More like jerky than steak. And then the beef tacos were chewy and also had a funny frozen meat taste. We are still on a mission to find delicious tacos here in Phoenix. Frustrating considering we are only a few hours from Mexico. Oh well. This place definitely isn't it.",

The Guacamole is from a packet, the beef taquitos and tacos are dryer than the Mojave  desert.  The flautas were stale and had the texture of a 3 month year old deep fried corn tortilla. The salsa and soda were the best things to enjoy at this establishment.  The waitress and service was nice but my god the food is horrible. I should have known when you walk in and see mostly Caucasian people eating your probably in the wrong place with no Hispanics dining.  The Spanish rice is definitely from a box and not fresh.  Very very sad. I won't be back. I suggest eating at Ritos Mexican kitchen. I'm still hungry  and will probably chew on one of my flip flops or my daughters tennis shoe which either one would be more edible, fresher and tastier. Good luck to everyone but that's just my opinion.",

The hot sauce tasted just like Valentina hot sauce but the homemade version. Our server was sweet, a little rushed at first but we came in at the end of a lunch rush.

    "text": "Living just a half mile away for the past few years, I really had no excuse to avoiding Mi Patio for so long. I tend to stay away from any place that chips are considered a course in your meal and deep fried is a cooking method. While I still stick to this mothodology, its nice to break pace every few weeks to keep your sanity. I mean, you cant live on veggies for too long without getting a craving for something tasty, meaty, and full of carbs.  Mi Patio was just the spot. We ordered a spinach and cheese chimi and a couple orders of their tacos; chicken and beef. After filling up on chips and chowing down the great tasting tacos, we couldn't even begin to eat the chimi. While my expectations for a next day chimichanga wasn't so high up there, it was actually still good the next day. I imagine that it would have been all the better had I eaten it fresh from the kitchen. Maybe next time ill go light on the chips. Ive heard their $1.75 margaritas a decent; however, I cannot personally attest to this. At $1.75 it can't hurt to give it a try though.   Either way you slice it, Mi Patio is a solid choice for your Mexican delights.",

You can be seated, ordered, eat ad leave within 45 minutes, and that is with the free shot they sometimes give you! -price. You can go to plenty of other highly rated places and pay double the price....and this is better food. -fam owned-most of the people have worked there forever. They remember the regulars orders (and this place is so good there are a lot of regulars)  Favorite Food: -beef tacos-delicious. You can request with onions and tomatoes otherwise it comes with lettuce and cheese. I recommend #96-two tacos, beans and cheese. Mixing the beans together and adding a little hot sauce on top is delicious. **if you order this for pickup or to go it is a $1 cheaper by the way!** #106 Is another good combo. -Baja chicken burro. Oh my god delicious. This dish is all about the sauce. It goes so well together. **you can ask for the sauce on anything I learned by the way -chips and salsa are constantly being replenished and are so yummy and homemade   If I had to find negatives/to be straight up: -not my favorite guacamole. Not a lot of flavor. -quesadillas aren't always that crispy -margs aren't the strongest or made with the too ingredients but they are cheap and still yummy. Ask for a double with not too much ice!  This is by far the best Mexican food I have found in AZ. I never leave disappointed. The food is great ad you any best the service and prices.",

    "text": "I'm just gonna come out and say it, there is not enough tequila in Mexico, nor will there ever be, to be make this food even edible. I am not a picky eater, I ordered the Patio Chimi, which had an awful tomatillo sauce. It was oddly sweet. My mother ordered the green chile beef, that seemed to be missing beef and tasted like no Mexican food we've ever eaten. Her and I had to try and move the food around the plate to even make it look like we ate anything. The service was terrible. The staff seemed extremely indifferent towards the guests.   We are both first generation Mexican and this food was almost offensive, and to be quite honest, you can get better food at any Mexican fast food place.   We are not from Phoenix, but next time we are out here we will not be eating here, ever again.",

I had spinach enchilada with pinto beans and zucchini.  I ate every last bite on my plate.  The free chips and salsa were the bomb also.  My hubby got shredded beef tacos with rice and beans.  He was a happy camper also.  Next time we will go for dinner and drink some of those $1.75 margaritas.  How can you beat that?!?!    Seems like a decent place to bring the kids also... inexpensive and the inside is along the lines of a Garcias.  When I was at the register paying the bill I saw some Quesapilla's being served.  OMG they looked so fabulous that I will be ordering that next time.",

Our drinks were left empty for long peroids of time, and you better hope they got your order right the first time because youre never going to see your waiter again... We didnt see our waiter until her brought our bill, and he also forgot to split our checks and then complained when we asked him to, were only had three different checks... I doubt we will go back again.",

    "text": "Mi Patio is good. For the area that it is in, I find it strange that there isn't more competition in Mexican food. I guess I could head deeper into the aves but, as a rule of thumb, I don't associate the Avenues with solutions.   From the outside, I was concerned that we were walking into a canned beans, store-bought hard taco shells, overpriced experience. In retrospect, this is probably due to the Corona theme on the outside of the building that made me think of all the substandard Mexican joints in Tempe that survive off the binge drinking college crowd. So, shame on me for such judgement - authentic Mexican doesn't have to come from a rundown brink building in a south Phoenix barrio.  Promptly seated, the service was attentive and the food was good. I got my panfried taco shell (complete with bubbled sides - muy authentico!) and left fat and happy. I think Mi Patio may be our new go-to Mexican place when we don't want to drive all the way to the South Phoenix Barrio.",
