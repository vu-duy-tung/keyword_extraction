Out of the 500+ restaurants in Phoenix, Nello's is my favorite. I call it, \"The Italian mother I never had restaurant.\" They are only open until 10pm so make sure you arrive early in the evening.

Too bad the Blockbuster that was next door is closed... now I have to stop by Basha's for the movie....  Usually we get the margherita pizza because I eat with family members who are vegetarians. They always have Nello's add extra garlic to the pizza which is not a fave of mine, there is enough on it without adding extra, but that isn't Nello's fault... it's crazy Vegetarians trying to make up for the lack of tasty tasty meat. Hehe JK.  A different pizza that I enjoy with omnivore's is their bbq chicken pizza. It is always tasty and I am kind of full of sadness as I write about it. It has been too long since I have had that pizza!  I wish I could remember the other 2 pizza's I have tried and liked but I am not sure which ones they are.  Oh well. I might just have to go and update this in the near future.  One thing I really like about going there to dine is that they have a great beer selection that includes a few AZ brews. I am just trying to be semi-economical lately and eating at home allows the beer and wine to be cheaper. Plus no tip is really needed, although I usually give the take out gal a buck.",

We out pizza lovers so would never turn one down however given the high rave reviews expected a bit better. Our pizza was good but was skimpy on the toppings and a little on the dry side. It may have been due to the type of cheese that was used and the lack of enough BBQ sauce to make up for the consistency of the cheese (which was not mozzarella) . As i said, I love pizza so still enjoyed it and like the flavor. I would probably go again but try something different. The service was also very good both in attentiveness and speed of delivery.",

It was delicious!  I loved the atmosphere...had an upscale-ish decor but not too yuppie to make you feel uncomfortable for wearing jeans (our server had on a black tee shirt and a baseball cap.  The server was very personable, we never had empty drinks, and knew his way around the menu, which was great, as we had never been there before.  We got the Caprese for an app, and since my bf and I have opposite tastes in pizza, we each ordered our own so we could get what we wanted and have leftovers.  We could tell it was starting to get really busy, and a line was forming out the door, but the server made sure to stop by often, and not make us feel rushed as we sat for a few minutes finishing our beers.  Their ingredients were fresh and more than you can get at most pizza places (an awesome variety of cheeses to choose from, and everything from regular veggies to shrimp or salmon!).  For 2 people our bill ran just under $60, which was totally reasonable for an app, drinks, and 2 pizzas.  I will definitely be returning and recommending to my friends!",

I typically order the veggie pizza or the spinach pie when I order takeaway, but a couple of weeks ago, the husband and I decided to try dining in for a change. We ordered a couple of drinks, the bruschetta, and the pesto pecorino (pasta). While I enjoyed the bruschetta and the pasta, portion sizes were surprisingly small. My husband said he'd have to eat more at home in order to satisfy his hunger (and neither of us are large people!).

Love the pizza....thin dish is best and tasty salad and sandwiches. Happy hour is 3 to 6 and offers great deals on wine and drafts. My wife says don't the olives on the appetizer menu. It's a staple in our lives.....Nellos is the best!",

Not crowded, table for 3 in the bar....2 entrees came out quickly while I waited for a woodfired pizza.  My wife's salad was missing the pancetta as advertised.  My pizza finally arrived but was made incorrectly...I was told no problem, we'll make another one....waited, waited and bingo ANOTHER wrong pizza - this time it wasn't even close. After 2 hours I asked for the check and I'm gone.  Nello's get it together please and do something about your pizza dough - it's like cardboard lately.  Headed to Florencia for a while....and so is my $.",

    "text": "A favorite ahwatukee spot that never disappoints. Ordered carryout last night and got our usual Yukon Gold Pizza. This pizza has been our favorite for years and we rarely deviate. The potatoes are thinly sliced, the pancetta and Gorgonzola are perfect compliments. We tried it on the whole wheat crust for the first time and it didn't disappoint so if you prefer whole wheat give it a try! We always get the egg on the pizza and recommend you so too! We also always get a salad to go with and there isn't a bad choice on the menu. Last night we had the chopped chicken. It's a great blend of ingredients and the pine nuts add a nice crunch. Do yourself a favor and check out Nellos soon. You can't go wrong with anything on this menu, we've tried almost everything and NEVER had a subpar meal. The customer service here is always top notch as well. Family friendly but also good for a date night. Tip:  If you order the Yukon gold pizza, get the egg!!! It really takes the pizza to the next level. The weekends are busy so you may have to wait a few minutes for a table, but its worth it!",

I cannot speak for the rest of the menu, but I can say that any kind of pizza you order here is going to be excellent.  We have been enjoying Nello's for years and have never had a bad or questionable pie.  Nello's offers a pretty good selection of beers...and there are usually a couple of rotating taps that pour local craft favorites.  The atmosphere is typically bustling, oftentimes loud inside during rush hours...which is probably why we enjoy coming here when we are dining with our kids.  I'd definitely recommend Nello's and often bring out of town visitors in for a pie.  It's close by too, which is an added convenience.",

Tucked away into a strip mall in Awahtukee you will find Nello's , usually busy and buzzing with people either waiting for the deliciousness of their pizza or pasta or market specials , OR at their bar while waiting for a table. Even the bar is fun with a great selection of beers, wines and sparking wines for me, yay! Happy Hour is 3-6pm. The staff is very friendly too. We have now been here twice and I'm a fan so much so that when my husband asked me this week where our 'cheat meal' was gonna be , I immediately thought of Nello's. Away we went. The patio is a great place now that it is fall. We have tried the Market Board of charcuterie and cheese and it's very tasty. Last night we had the Calamari & Rock Shrimp as a starter ... we didn't care too much for the sauce, which seemed like a watery vodka type sauce , so we asked for a marinara , which our server was happy to accommodate and brought it  warmed and it was out of this world. We ordered The European pizza for our meal. Twelve inches of perfection on a pizza pan: Homemade Sausage , ricotta , mozzerella, fontinella, Romano, basil, olive oil and tomato and that perfect sauce. We got it on the regular crust but thin and gluten free are also available. We also added prosciutto and artichoke hearts. One piece will fill you! The first time we were here on our 'eat out ; take out because we are closing on a house' binge! , we had the Deluxe Combo and got the 14 inch. We had leftovers for days! The combo is all about the original combination pizza , only Nello's makes it in an amazing way that is out of this world. The salads are enough for sharing too. That night we sat at the bar for a good 30 or so minutes waiting for a table but it was fun! It's a happening place for a strip mall tucked in like this .. who knew?! They have beers by the pack you can buy and carry out. I love a rose sparkling and they had that too! I'm a fan of Nello's ... a huge pizza loving fan!",

I do want to note that the server had asked me what I wanted for my side, so I picked the salad, assuming it was included. Come to find out when I got the bill it was an add-on I was being charged extra for. So after tax, tip and drink it was almost a $20 lunch for an okay sandwich.

The pizza was one of the best we've ever had! We ordered the bruschetta appetizer which were fresh and crafted nicely. The Antipasto salad is tossed in House Italian dressing, which was delightful. We would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good Italian restaurant.",

They have great combinations of quality toppings.  I love the thin crust, I love they have a different, creative market special every week.  They have Four Peaks on tap.  $3 Guinness on Happy Hour.  The salads are delicious.  I crave the house dressing and the white balsamic.  The staff is top notch, totally cool and friendly, and really take the time to get to know their customers.  It is great for families, for cool, casual dates, and low-key gathering of friends.  This is combination of qualities, and the fact that I am usually there once a week, Nello's in Ahwatukee really is as good as it gets and will continue to be one of my go-to restaurants.",

The toppings were fine.  The toast wasn't.  Normally, bruschetta is served on lightly toasted, thickly sliced bread that is crunchy on the edges and softer in the center.  This version was served on what amounted to a large crouton.  Completely hard and not very tasty.  The waiter assured me the \"bread\" was made in house but I suspect that's not the case.  I think it's purchased in a pre-toasted, fully-realized crouton state.  Either way, the pizza more than made up for the appetizer!  I chose the Yukon Gold pizza which comes with VERY thinly sliced potatoes, pancetta, gorgonzola, mozz, rosemary, and olive oil - a white pizza.  I'm a vegetarian and they are SUPER nice about customizing.  I asked for mushrooms instead of pancetta, and added onions.  It was outstanding!  Wonderful, Neapolitan style crust perfectly baked in a wood fired oven.  One of the best pizzas I've ever had, actually.  The rosemary was fresh, not dried which made a huge difference.    I love a restaurant that stays open all day and just has a single menu, not lunch and dinner.  Another plus for Nello's.  I visit Phoenix every year and I will make this place part of every trip.",

So, that being said..Nello's was on my list of must try legendary restaurants..when the Uber dropped me off my first thought was, how does this supposed legendary restaurant get a spot next to a fraternity ridden, trash pad greasy sports bar? That's got to be interesting for business!   When I entered in, I was promptly greated by an exuberant, exotic slightly bearded fellow with a hip plaid shirt..not bad, made me feel comfortable, welcomed. When I sat at the bar, I observed a very close relationship between the coworkers that seemed, as one of their shirts said, like FAMILY! The guy that greated me as if we've been friends for years, also took my drink order! Fresh Squeezed! Hell YES! I'll take 3!   Some small talk as I asked questions about the menu, then some grub. At this point, I want to just hang out, I think his name was Dan..or Dave..we were best friends by this point and I thought it rude to request his name once again.  First up (1 Fresh Squeeze down, 1 on deck!) I ordered a special item..the Chefs Board. Brilliance on wood! Every item was displayed like a picture in a world class cook book. Chef Ramsey would have nothing but praise for this wonderment of delicatessen delight! Maybe some dill pickles added is all I'd say..but even if not, I'll order this every time I'm in town.  Entree. (2 Fresh Squeezed down, switching to iced tea..which is fresh brewed, and tasty). Gluten free pizza with Real! Olive Oil..no sh#%..you can taste it's legitimacy! Cheese, chicken, bacon and pepperoni. I can't imagine ordering anything else. It was all super good, real...fresh made on their own, combined together for an amazing conglomeration of palate igniting insanity. After my food erection went away, my new best friend, D-simething, told me about the mint chocolate chip Gelato..so, since his advice has been spot on thus far, and we are now besties, he hooked it up! And all I need to know is...where...where can I buy this by the pint?   Mind...BLOWN! Thanks Dan..or Dave..eh.. you're my new Phoenix go to guy! Thanks for the touristy suggestions and just all around badass experience you led me on! I WILL be back!     - a very awesomely stuffed (with good, quality food!) Hans / IT Security Specialist.",

Our favorite server is Tyler, he is always pleasant and always takes care of whatever we need. It makes the night when your server is taking care of you and being nice as well. Colton is one of the managers there he is always taking care of the guest in the dinning room making sure things run smooth. I live in Ahwatukee and this is one of my favorite places to go.",

My only disappointment was that they were out of cheesecake. Roxanne was my server and she was fast and thoughtful. I had ordered the shrimp app and said it'd be great over pasta, 3min later she brought pasta. They played bluegrass country music and had sports on the TVs on mute. Great combo of sports bar and wine place. Four things I love! Wine, carbs, sports and country music.",

Over the years the Ahwatukee location has maintained the original quality of the pizza and sandwiches and the Chicago pizza joint ambiance the Mai brothers had at the original location.   Their gluten free crust is as good as the original, which makes it my daughter's favorite place. The beer and wine selection is good and the staff is always friendly, courteous and efficient.   There are lots of fancy pizza places to assuage the snobbery of the pretentious types. Nello's is for those who want to dig into a genuine, authentic Chicago pie.",

We got a side marinara to dip it in and it is well worth the side charge for it. Although they are known for their pizzas don't overlook the sandwiches and salads. I had the parlor burger. I got a medium it was so juicy and delicious and for my toppings I chose bacon, sauteed mushrooms, and their homemade mozzarella cheese. It was fantastic! The fries were not the hottest temp so they loose some zing, but that happens everywhere. The food runner dropped a cup of ketchup and it landed in the lap of the guest across from me. Some hit my shirt and there was a little bit tension but we laughed it off because the food was delicious. The tiramisu was good. I like it soggier but they are consistent.  The only bad part. After the ketchup incident hitting over 66% of the people at the table no one came by to see if we were OK or ask if they could do anything for us. The food runner gave us a bunch of napkins but that was it. I'm guessing the food runner didn't tell the server or a manager. I only rate places on food, not service so they still got 4 stars.",

    "text": "A friend and I chose Nello's because it is a casual neighborhood eatery with really good food.  We were not disappointed.  We each had a \"small\" Caesar salad.  The portion was extremely generous, and the taste was excellent.  There were plenty of croutons, lots of fresh grated parmesan cheese on top of crisp greens with just the right amount of tangy dressing.  Good choice.  I had the Crema Americana with Italian sausage.  It was absolutely delicious. You can tell the pasta is made fresh, and it makes such a difference.  The bechamel sauce was creamy but not heavy.  The sausage added a nice bit of zing.  My friend ordered the Pomodoro Maiale with chicken added.  He cleaned his plate, and declared the dish a winner that he would definitely order again.  He also commented on the fresh pasta, adding that the bacon and cheese in the tomato sauce made it a an excellent topping for the pasta.  Our server was Zac, and he took excellent care of us.  Right there when we needed him, but not intrusive.  He was well schooled on the menu, and made sure to let us know we were in Happy Hour if we wanted to order anything from that menu.  All in all, an excellent experience.  So nice to have a place like this so close to home.",

But today I was disappointed. What happened to my favorite pizza place?  They used to have a combo deep dish Chicago style pizza loaded at least 1 inch thick with toppings including huge pieces of spicey sausage. But what I received today was a remnant of those days - an odd mix of deep dish crust edge with an amount of toppings barely the thickness of most thin crust pizzas.  I can only guess that at some point they reduced the amount of filings to lower costs and have to wonder if this was the crucial mistake which lead to the closure of their main restaurant. As pizza, it wasn't terrible. But if you are looking for Chicago style, you may want to have a frozen one shipped.",

We called and talked to Shea the manager who condescendingly said that although Nello's washes their lettuce they can't help that a worm won't get off the lettuce.   Now we know the little green worm is quite little, but we are particular that our protein intake not be alive and moving.   With all the lunch providers in Ahwatukee and with the holiday season you would think Nello's may have been apologetic and even a little generous.   We weren't expecting our entire $40 ticket to be comped, but when we asked if I could receive some compensation, Shea responded by saying they can replace the half sandwich/salad if my co-worker came back in that day.   Not even an apology and a $10 gift card.  I guess the Ahwatukee Nello's has a manager who doesn't really believe in a high level of customer service.   I wouldn't have posted this if she would have been a bit kinder in her tone and generous by only a few more dollars.   It really is all about how people are treated - I hope Shea's staff is treated better than we were.",

    "text": "Go for the thin crust!   Overall experience was wonderful, service was attentive, straight to the point and not smothery. Food at this local pizza joint is high quality you can taste. As a chef dining out for a casual lunch, I left pleased and with cash still in my pocket.  First we had the Roasted Eggplant Bruschetta, the baguette was toasted to perfection. The crust was crisp with a nice light sourdough flavor and chew, not over toasted a bit and still tender on the inside. The four baguettes were topped with a beautiful creamy, tangy goat cheese. The eggplant was beautifully roasted and naturally rich in flavor. Sun-dried tomatoes added a nice acid element to this dish, which was served warm with a well balanced Balsamic Reduction.   Next we tried the Smoked Chicken and Broccoli Pizza. The crust, oh gosh. THE CRUST! Perfect. Thin and crunchy, tender, caramelized in the wood burning oven to a perfect golden brown. The smoked chicken was still moist, the broccoli still had a nice bite to it as all vegetables should and had a fantastic roasted flavor. No sauce here, just a little olive oil and garlic went down before the toppings. The Mozzarella and Smoked Provolone were appropriate, but a nice nutty Asiago or Parmesan-Reggiano would have been a welcome touch.  Bacon? Of course we added bacon! An Applewood Smoked Bacon. Although in recent years bacon, and especially Applewood Smoked has been overplayed in the culinary world, Nello's kept it organic in style. The bacon has a wonderful fatty crunch, just the right balance of salt and smoke and cooked just so. The half slabs of thick, delicious bacon were simply laid over our pizza towards the end of cooking. Very pleased this bacon wasn't chopped up into tiny bits.   The Banana-Nut Bread Pudding was tempting but Tiramisu has my heart. Being half Italian I know Tiramisu and Nello's has made a great play on this classic dessert. First a thick layer of creamy mascarpone was sweetened to not over power the cheese itself. The ladyfinger layer held its integrity and wasn't soaked to the point of sogginess which is a pleasant surprise. Another generous layer of mascarpone and a surprisingly thick dusting of cocoa powder was a great touch.   Nello's is worth every penny, the bill for two of us was just over $30.00. We left full and happy, too many dining experiences can be disappointing if the little details are left out. They don't miss a beat! David was a fantastic server with an upbeat attitude, the rest of the staff was also attentive and helpful. Beer and Wine selection is nice as well, there is definitely something for everyone here.   Like Nello's on Facebook, they post special items with fantastic seasonal ingredients that any food lover would get pumped over!    I will be back time and time again.",

The Market fresh thin crust is always amazing. Every week it is different which is great. We have tried the ones on the menu but the weekly special is usually the best choice.  I like the deep dish but ask for light bake and extra sauce. This makes left overs great and I do not like a crunchy crust.  My wife likes the pizza crust and when combined with their sauce for \"dipping\" it is top notch.  The service is always good and the same people have been there for years (always a good sign).  I agree the beer selection is great and the bar tenders are very knowledgeable and can find a good match for anyone. They are one of the few places with 4 Peaks Hop Knot.

    "text": "What can you say about Nellos....a truly family run operation serving up good pizza in a friendly atmosphere. Although there are a number of locations throughout the Valley now, I remember when living in Ahwatukee going to Nellos, and seeing the late Pat Tillman, his wife, along with his brother and Jake Plummer eating pizza and having a good time. Everyone knew who Pat and Jake were, but they were left along, treated like normal customers, and it made for a special memory everytime we would see them. The pizza is the foundation, but with a great offering of sandwhiches and Italian dishes, there isn't a bad item on the menu. I truly love the house dressing that they make and bottle for purchase. It turns a normal green salad into a tasty treat. If you have a Nello's in your area, for the value and service, they are a great choice.",

Nello's bruschetta is the best priced I have ever seen.  6 large pieces for $9 is a steal.  Unlike what Kristen thinks she knows bruschetta does not always come on thick sliced bread.  Try having a sausage and goat cheese pizza in the wood fired oven.  Leave off the mozzarella.",

I either get their 1/2 sandwich and soup special or salad... you get to chose from any sandwich (turkey and avocado is always great) on the menu and the soup special or a garden salad or Cesar salad.  perfect amount of food.  I also really like their salads... I have had the salmon and cous cous salad which is great and the Chicken and Gorgonzola salad which is also very good.  The reason they did not get 5 stars is because sometimes their service is pretty slow... i have a feeling this is due to the lunch rush.",

Nice atmosphere, great service and a surprisingly good dining experience awaited. We didn't want to fill up after the previous days eating frenzy so we shared an Antipasto Salad that was, like the menu stated more than enough for 2. Also ordered a mozzarella plate with veggies and tomatoes and olives and some nice crusted bread. Could not be happier. They have a wide selection of beers, of which I enjoyed a few pints. Thank you Nellos for a nice evening with my better half. We will be back.",

    "text": "After all the rants and raves I have heard about Nellos, I was sadly disappointed. This place had been made out to be one of the best pizza places in Ahwatukee. I started off the meal with a basic dinner salad with the house dressing and ordered a veggie thin crust pizza. The dressing is delicious, and I would definitely consider buying a bottle of it to keep at home.However as our pizza arrived, I saw the first hint that this pizza place was not going to live up to its reputation. First of all, I ordered a thin crust pizza, however, my pizza looked as if it was just regular crust. The pizza itself wasn't bad- fresh ingredients, good amount of cheese and toppings, but the sauce could use a little more basil or oregano. I was thoroughly unimpressed. My boyfriend ordered a deep dish pizza, and suffice to say, it wasn't really deep dish. It looked like regular pizza just with super high pizza crust walls. The topping and the flavors were good, but the deep dish pizza wasn't really filled enough to be considered deep dish.  The food simply just didn't live up to countless good reviews I had heard about it before.",

I had family and kids waiting in the car and had no explanation.  It was obvious this was going to take a while.  I went on my own in the restaurant to find a manager and the takeout girl ran up and stood between me and the manager and talked over me. I left in disgust.

The pizza was OK and definitely better than Domino's, even with their new spiffy recipe.    We got the veggie pizza, which sounded better than what we actually got.  The end product looked great, but I think maybe there are too many toppings for the crust to hold.  The crust ended up a little soggy, especially towards the center, and the sauce seemed to have been absorbed by the toppings save around the outside of the pizza.  Despite this, the pizza was edible and I'll probably order from them again at some point.  Instead of getting their veggie pizza, I'll probably pick my own toppings and simplify things a little.  Hopefully that will solve the soggy-no-sauciness problem.",

I completely understand ordering good food and expecting to wait for it, but this was OUTRAGEOUS!! It nearly took a hour to cook this pizza - I personally saw the people who came in at the same time as us - enjoy their pizza and leave!?!   When the pizza arrived it sure didn't look properly cooked nor enticing. But I never judge a book by its cover...   so we dug in... considering all the hype I've heard about  this I expected better.

How can they not have Cheese cake for which they are well known for, or any other choices.  Needless to say after spending over $230 including the mandatory 20% tip for a party of 16, (which i had no problem, as the service was good) we were very disapointed with the lack of food selections.

I'm not too thrilled with their happy hour food menu but their regular menu is priced fairly so it's no issue there.  I usually get the turkey pesto panini which comes with cranberries inside. Delicious. They have good fries here too, so I get that as my side.  Their thin crust pizza is NOT thin, it's very regular to thick. If you want thin crust, order the gluten free. I know sometimes gluten free items can taste a little funny - but not this! It's really good.  FYI - they are closed on Mondays.",

We used to go to the one on McClintock and Southern at least once a week back in high school for crust and sauce...I hold it in high regard. So the old store closed some time back and I found this one. It is not the same - the pizza just wasn't the same. A little too much dough and oil in the crust. It could have been an off night...who knows.   The location was decorated beautifully and I really enjoyed the ambiance. Decent pricing...dinner for two, large salad and medium pizza with a couple beers and a pizza to go for the kids...around $60. If you can get on the waiting list early, do it. Wait times run around 35-45 minutes at dinner.",

We canceled the salad and just had the pizza. In the past the oven brick bake was always perfect but the last two times the bottom was half baked.

Well, almost two decades later, I finally tried Nellos and I'll definitely be back. I ordered my veggie pizza over the phone and then came in to enjoy a glass of red sangria at the bar as I waited. The service is...iffy. The hostess ignored me when I first walked in. She seemed preoccupied. I told her I needed to pay for my phone order and she told me that she'd meet me at the end of the bar. Well...I didn't see her make her way over there so I decided to sit at the bar and have my drink. Boy, am I glad I did! That was some of the best sangria I've ever had in my life. It was refreshing, but not too sweet and one glass was all I needed! So when I say I'll be back, it's not for the pizza LOL! Nobody told me my pizza was ready so after about 20-30 minutes of me sitting at the bar I decided to inquire about my order. Sure enough, it was just sitting there...getting soggy *sigh* thanks to the buzz of the sangria, I shrugged it off and just went home. I had two slices of my veggie pizza and it was good after being re heated in my microwave. Being honest, I wasn't blown away but I'm willing to give Nellos another try.",

You definitely get all that and great service at Nello's.  Fresh pizza does take a while longer to prepare than chain par-baked dough.  The salads are huge and are full of flavor.

I love the crust of the pizza. It's different than every other pizza place there is out there. It is very inexpensive too. My boyfriend always gets a salad, we share a pizza (half cheese and half applewood smoked bacon) and have an appetizer and we are usually out of there for 18 to 22 bucks before tip.   I usually sit outside when I go because it is really loud inside. It's really nice outside and for the winter months (even though it's really not super cold here) they have heaters.   The reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because we had a rude waiter once. Since we have been there so many times and it was only one time, I'm still a major fan!   I would recommend this place to anybody who likes pizza and wants a change from the everyday pizza chains that are out there.",

    "text": "Anticipating the pizza craving that I always get after happy hour I'm going to pre-order a 10\" original deep dish, mushrooms, spinach, and homemade sausage from the nearby Nellos for tonight.  Nellos crust, on any occasion, is one of my favorites. There's something magical about it. The bottom of the crust is just firm and thick enough to withstand the weight of the fresh and flavorful toppings. The combination of the bottom of the crust and the fresh and homemade toppings is just the beginning.   The edge of the crust steals the show. The light and dark gold color's of the edge draws you in right away. Each bite starts off crunchy to the tooth and ends with a soft and chewy melt in your mouth dough. The crust is a big component on why their pizza is so delicious.  I've only been to their Ahwatukee location but I'm sure the other locations are just as good. Their pizzas and their tiramisu are worth 4-5 stars but everything else on their menu is just ok. But who needs to try anything else when you have crust like they do.",

Although limited from an options standpoint, the lunch special was perfect for us. Includes an 8\" pizza with two toppings, drink, and a side/caesar salad for only $10! Really can't beat that!   Everything came out quickly and absolutely delicious!! Cheese was melted so perfect with just the amount of sauce... mmm yum! We ended up staying for 2 hours rambling about nothing but we were never rushed to move along and the server was an absolute gentlemen always refilling our pops and waters. Can't wait to come back again soon!",

The dressing is amazing! The salad was a tad boring. There is no cheese but lots of raw carrots. I'd much rather have cheese on a salad even if the carrots were still there.   I got the garlic butter shrimp appetizer. I LOVE this dish anywhere I go. When it was placed in front of me I immediately smelled that fishy stink. The shrimp was over cooked and the sauce was tasty but too much pepper. I have to say this won't prevent me from coming back but not sure I'd order anything with shrimp.",

    "text": "A few coworkers and I grabbed takeout from Nello's today, after being highly recommended by one of our peers, and we were not disappointed!  We ordered three pizzas and an order of their Pork Wings. You read that correctly; PORK Wings. These wings were so unique you almost need to order them just to experience their awesomeness. The delicious morsels were extremely tender with plenty of meat on the bone and drizzled with a savory house made sauce.   Speaking of house-made sauces, their pizza sauce was extremely flavorful, made from fresh tomatoes and just the right amount of basil for a perfect pizza sauce. Our 12\" thin crust Sausage, Mushrooms, and Onion pizza was the first to be polished off by the group. While this was very good and clearly the favorite among the majority, I preferred the original crust.   We ordered two 14\" original crust pizzas: Pepperoni / Ricotta and a Meatball / Bacon. I agree with what some other folks said about the crust almost being \"focaccia-like\". It was light and slightly chewy with just a touch of butter. The pep was slightly spicy and generously layered underneath the cheese (how I prefer my toppings), with the Ricotta crumbled on top. The meatballs were excellent and made in house with full size strips of real bacon all over the pizza. You won't find any precooked microwaved bacon here!   Currently experiencing some regret not ordering any extra for leftovers, but I won't make that same mistake next time!",

On this trip I ventured out of my norm and had their Cesar salad. I asked for the salad to be dressed (as it should be, IMO :-)) the salad hardly had any dressing. The croutons however were delicious!  I also ordered the lasagna. It was definitely too spicy for me. Their Italian sausage was just a tad too spicy and either the lasagna or sauce was extra garlicky. The lasagna was also very dry. I guess I'm used to it having bechamel sauce. All in all it wasn't terrible, but definitely not for me. The bread that came with it was delicious though.  We'll be back for the pizza for sure!",

I was referred here by another patron who shares my passion of toppings, rustic bright sauce, and classic chewy dough.   Funny story-  I ordered two pizzas yesterday. One cheese and another layered with fresh veggies. My family enjoyed a mere three unbelievable pieces of hot stretchy cheese and the like and decided to go for a quick swim. We returned to a happy pooch sitting between two eaten and proudly chewed up pizza boxes. Seriously! My pup pounded his pie hole eating both large pizzas. Grrrrrr...   I couldn't help to repeat the order today because the pies were so good. Stretchy, house-made cheese atop a variety of toppings makes this my new pizza go-to.  Their specialty pies are also unique. Chicken lover? Then order their crispy chicken sandwich. It's unreal and topped with slaw and dressing on a soft brioche bun. Their herb shrimp app is also filling dunked in butter and herbs. I can't rate the service as we ordered takeout. But, based on the cleanliness of the restaurant and friendliness of the host I can only guess they take care of their customers.",

This mixture of calamari & rock shrimp is delicious and the marinara is IMHO much better for dipping than the sauce that comes with the dish.     This time we ordered the 14\" original crust Classic European pizza add meatball (DO THIS!).  Turns out meatball was a fantastic choice and really augmented the rich flavor of this already-delicious pizza.    We also ordered the 12\" thin crust Wood Fired Yukon Gold + egg pizza to try something new.  It was good but I'd like it better if the whole thing had egg on it instead of just the center.   Kind of reminded us of breakfast.  Glad we tried it but will probably go back to our favorite Pavone Pepperoni again next time.   One daughter ordered an 8\" Pesto Bianca pizza as well.  She let me have a piece and I'll say it was really, really good.  That pesto and the sundried tomato they put on there is really tasty!   I'd order this again but watch out for those nut allergies - the pesto is walnut based.    Another satisfying visit to Nello's!",

We were seated by the hostess when we arrived and was told our server would be right over. 10 minutes later I had to go back to the hostess and asked if anyone was going to take our order. Our waitress finally showed up to our table apologizing. My wife had the eggplant parmigiana and I had the chicken parmigiana. My dish was ok but nothing to write home about. My wife's dish consisted of a lot of breading and little or no eggplant. A very tasteless dish. We've been to Nello's before and had their pizza. It was excellent. I'll give them a mulligan on the no waitress. It could have easily been a miscommunication. We'll definitely go back but will stick with pizza but stay away from their entrees.",

Ordered an 8\" pizza with pepperoni and pineapple (don't judge me) for $7. Got there and they opened the box to show me the pizza, cut into quarters. There were (count 'em) eight tiny pieces of pineapple (that's two per slice) and the big fat puffy crust comprised 1/3 of the entire pizza. No kidding! It was so bizarre-looking that should have taken a pic. But no worries, I thought....I like crust and they gave me a side of pineapple. Well, it was the WORST pizza I've ever eaten. Totally flavorless. Lesson learned. Back to Pizza Hut I go, even if it means driving five miles to the nearest location. I hate wasting money on bad food!",

I ordered a pizza with black olives and beef. I had the \"original\" crust. The crust was thick, chewy and tasteless. It looked as thought it was put on a conveyer oven, not woodfired. After the second slice the crust became too hard, bland and chewy to even eat, like cardboard. It was a very bad product. The sauce was very bland, and it looked very much like a frozen pizza, except some frozen pizzas are better. I really don't understand the pizza market in Phoenix.  I grew up in on authentic Italian pizza and cuisine, albeit here in Phoenix everyone seems to sing high praises to very bad pizzas. This pizza does not even compare to a good Pizza. I just think that the folks here in Phoenix haven't tasted a real pizza, If they travel back East and try the pizza then they would know what real Pizza Pie is supposed to taste like.  For now if I want a good Pizza Pie, I'll just have to make it my self.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  One Star for the Food, One Star for the Service (Service was good, Pizza Bad)",

I've actually Googled some of their specialty toppings at the table to figure out what they are, the cheeses so specific to regions around the world that you'll want to learn more on why they are notable.  Original crust is thick and buttery, yielding heavy toppings and tender strands of mozzarella.  I'm a big fan of the Schriers pepperoni on a margherita pizza, laden with fresh garlic and torn basil.  Salads are hearty and plentiful, with a killer Spinach Salad (crisp bacon, egg, crunchy radishes and grape tomatoes) and White Balsamic Dressing.  Waitstaff at this location are bustling while still managing to be endearing.  Service can get spotty on weekends when the place crowds a bit, but on two separate occasions where mistakes were made, the manager corrected both immediately with not only no charges for the items but still sending the ordered items.  We've actually left with two pizzas in hand - totally unasked for but very appreciated.  I don't really compare the pizza here to other thin-crust pies - it's so specific of a taste, it's almost its own thing.  That all being said, it's such a yummy experience, if you don't pigeonhole the pizza, you are in for a treat.",

Nello's is really known for their deep dish pizza and its my absolute favorite. We order a ton of toppings and its always the perfect ratio for a balanced pizza. I've only come in for pickup so I can't speak to service eating there, but I'm always immediately greeted by someone when I walk in to pickup.   The salads are all well done and my favorite is the chicken gorgonzola salad with their house raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  I haven't had one I didn't like. They also have great tvs and I'd def come in for a game. If you live close, walk down to Nellie's. I love this neighborhood and this place!",

The salads are awesome and large, the bruschetta is solid, and the tiramisu...oh, the tiramisu.  Save room for it.  The beer selection is great and if you're in the neighborhood during happy hour, make sure to stop in.  There are some great deals (1/2 off apps, cheap drinks).",

Have eaten here before. As I recall, it was much better.  I could've gotten more flovor from Dominos, or Pizza Hut, although the flavors not good, at least, you got flavor. Noticed alot of people got various toppings, I didn't. I think if you get a good pizza,it should taste good plain, to start with, then add toppings. If it dosen't, the pizza's goin to be mediocre at best. Try Florencias on Ray Rd. much much better, regardless of toppings.",

And this was after we let it sit for awhile.  (I love my thin-crust pizzas hot, very crispy and fresh-- not cold nor stale, and if it's the least bit soggy, I am heartbroken.)  But Nello's was definitely a hit tonight!  I kicked myself for waiting all this time to go back for another taste.  I'll be returning VERY soon!

I asked my group's members for suggestions, and Nello's Pizza was the answer I got more than any other. So I decided to give it a try. I ordered a couple pizzas for pick-up. I got a list lost on the way (it's in Ahwatukee, even though the address is Phoenix), but when I called the person who answered pleasantly and calmly directed me there. When I arrived the pizzas were ready to go. I paid and headed on my way. They had these cute little boxes that were round (or maybe the better word is geometric) on the inside and square on the outside for ease of handling/less waste (my best guesses). The smell in my car as I drove to my event was HEAVENLY! It was all I could do not to pull over and break out the pizza myself! Once I arrived at my destination and dug into a slice of the Classic European pizza (14\" original crust) I was in truly in HEAVEN! It did not disappoint. I had two slices and ended up wanting more. I also ordered a wheat-crust 14\" Four Cheese pizza. We had about 12 people, and let me tell you, every slice was gone in less than a half hour! I will definitely go there again and maybe eat in this time; they had a nice dining area and covered, misted patio too. Thanks, Nello's!",
