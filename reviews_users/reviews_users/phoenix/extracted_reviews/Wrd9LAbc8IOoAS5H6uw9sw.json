The food was amAzing and well priced the portions were totally legit and I loved every bite of my roasted cauliflower dish my friend ordered a less legit mushroom dish that was wrapped in naan type stuff like a giant mushroom panini (was really good as left overs with its three sauces 2 Of which ruled 1 or which was tasteless and odd . there wasn't na'an on the menu thou just other bread not called na'an . I would def think I should point out there's no pictures on the menu and the staff seemed to lack the English skills to convey what exactly each dish was if I was to ask so I just choose to guess turned out well for me not as hot for my buddy",

    "text": "The lackluster service began when I walked in the door. I was unenthusiastically shown to the end of a number of community tables near the kitchen entrance, which I unknowingly accepted. The few tables on the outskirts were taken, so, I got up to select from an average offering of items at the lunch buffet, still excited for the new experience. Sitting back down with my recent selections and preparing to attempt to enjoy lunch my (unbeknownst to me) arch nemesis entered the dining room an older Indian? Woman in a lovely golden dress, whom my server greeted with a bow, arrived. I thought 'how nice a person with an ownership or familial interest in the restaurant is here...' little did I know. I attempted to enjoy my mediocre selection from the buffet  when I was jostled (almost knocked from my chair by above mentioned lady with a large pan of silverware.) Working in a restaurant, were I to bump into, let alone almost dislodge a patron from their seat I would offer an apology... Yet nothing was said. Suddenly a cacophony erupts from behind me as the lady in gold begins polishing silverware with gusto picking up forks and knives from one metal bin, wiping them with a napkin only to THROW them into another metal bin at maximum velocity at 12:15 during the Friday lunch 'rush' maybe 15-20% occupancy I requested to be moved from sitting 3 feet from an audition for a heavy (literal) metal band to a table far away. I was still well within earshot more so as a second individual began to compete for the loudest silverware polishing championship. I was cut off by an employee rushing to the kitchen as I attempted to return to the buffet, never offered a beverage and as Naan was tossed on my table the manager could not be bothered to even meet my eye, let alone smile. I predict that the recent influx of new restaurants in this complex will slowly strangle this thoroughly unimpressive culinary disaster to death, even as they wonder why they are failing and eventually close.   Three options for success exist 1. burn the \"restaurant\" and collect the insurance. 2. Funnel money for organized crime. 3. advertise to future restauranteurs 'how not to run a restaurant' and show how to succeed by doing the opposite of this miserable excuse for a dining experience.",

Every time I come in the manager comes by to see how everything is and the rest of the staff is great. One time I went in right before they were suppose to close (without knowing) and they never rushed me, even though we were those last minute customers.",

This place was a go to for getting filled up on $10 when I was going to ASU, but as a vegetarian I always found its chickpea dishes left something to be desired.  Coming back as a reformed vegetarian and omnivore, I realized this place has some fantastic chicken.  The classic tikka masala and tandoori chicken are both good, with nice cuts without too many bones.  I also really liked the saag this time around.  Lentils were as good as any I had in Nepal, and not nearly as watery as they were there.  They've redecorated too and the paintings are brighter and more cheerful than they used to be.",

    "text": "I spend allot of time at the Tempe Improv so I go to the Delhi Palace for the lunch buffet which is located on the south side of the building across the street on University. The lunch buffet is open from 11:00 - 2:30 so if you like authentic northern Indian cuisine this is the real deal for $8.95 and the best part is you don't have to whip out the Sun Brand Tandoori Powder and make it yourself.  I normally do not like buffet food that has been sitting under a heat lamp for any length of time but if you arrive early at 11:00 when they first open there is a good chance your buffet food experience will be a good one. I believe the food on the lunch buffet is not spicy on purpose to appeal to the masses which would make since, I personally prefer my Indian food spicy with some burn and I'm sure if you order something off the regular menu they will kick it up a notch for you.  The Delhi Palace is home of the MASALA they have Chicken Tikka Masala, Garam Masala, Chana Masala, Chaat Masala, Tandoori Masala, and even Yogurt Masala. The only Masala missing off the menu is Penn Masala, the world's first Hindi a cappella singing group formed in 1996 by a group of students at the University of Pennsylvania. Deep down I must believe ASU is working on their first Hindi a cappella singing group but heck that's another story.  My personal favorites here are the Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Korma, Palak Paneer, Chicken Tikka Masala and the Garlic Naan bread if your into Indian beers you will like the fact they have Taj Mahal and Flying Horse Royal Lager beer, I normally drink the hot chai tea.  Repeat after me can you say green mint chutney.",

    "text": "While not my favorite indian buffet, this one was pretty good.  There was a fairly large and varied selection. I found everything I had to be tasty, just seeming to be flavored towards the bland end of mild. I also found all of the dishes to have a higher level of oiliness than i would have liked. There was not as much 'char' flavor on the tandoori chicken as I am used to. The garlic naan was not only delicious, but it comes straight to your table hot and they just keep bringing it, as long as you're eating it, no need to run out or even ask for more. Service was prompt and courteous, but it was too busy while I was there for them to be able to display anything beyond simply keeping things up with the rush, which they did nicely. The tables were a little cramped even when some of them were still empty, but as soon as the placed filled up, it was ridiculous. There were an unfortunate few whose table was placed so near the buffet that they were in the way of the line that formed. That lined was so much worse than it should have been, however someone long ago made the unfortunate decision to place the buffet line in a U shape. This makes it hard for more than 2-3 people to dish out food at the same time, and everyone else waits outside of the U for their turn. I thought the L shape of another buffet I go to was inconvenient, but I'm going to love it next time i go compared to this U buffet. Many things to enjoy here, including the value.  It's under ten bucks, and there seems to always be a $1 off coupon available somewhere.",

Recently though I have had some not so great experiences.   I keep coming back because of their Madrasi Chicken dish. Its the only place I can find it and it is delicious with its coconut curry tasting chicken, ahh, its so good with their rice. But everything else has seemed to decline in quality recently. I'm finding more of the chicken is dark meat and in strange pieces. I'm not a fan of dark meat and think it looks gross and cheap. Everything had become way more oily than I remember. My chicken sag just left so much oil on the plate I was really disappointed. Dishes are still tasty just not as amazing as I remember.   My biggest issue has been the service recently. The service used to be on it! They were clean professional, and everything was perfect. Last time I had to repeat my order 4 or 5 times over the phone until I thought they finally understood what I was saying. When I came to pick it up the order was wrong. When I asked them to correct it they seemed annoyed. It seemed like everyone was running around asking for dishes; they seemed rushed and unorganized. They did offer me the correct dish for free which made up for the mistake. Another time after the takeout order we were dining in. I pointed to my selection on the menu just to be crystal clear. I was still served the wrong dish. Having this happen two times in a row really put me off.   I feel like these kinds of things didn't used to happen a few years ago. The food was better quality and the service was outstanding. I cant say either of those two things about it now. I'm only coming back for their madrasi chicken for now. For my other Indian food nights, I am going elsewhere.",

    "text": "This is my favorite place to go!  It's clean inside and the place is nicely decorated.  They have thick wine glasses for you to drink water out of and the place has low lighting to give that nicer relaxed feeling.  I love going here with my friends.   Sometimes we will go in big groups of 15 people, and they have never given us a problem for bringing such a big group.  My two favorite dishes are the tikki masala curry with chicken and the paneer (spinach curry) with a large order of garlic naan (garlic bread that is super delicious).    My real favorite treat is coming during their buffet hours. I only go on the weekends around 11, when the food is hot and fresh.  The cost is only $8.95 (since last time I've been) and you get to eat from a variety of popular dishes, including all my favorite: garlic naan, tikki masala, paneer, korma chicken, and more!  The buffet also comes with unlimited Indian Thai tea!  I just love their buffet for the quality and price!   One thing that is not in the buffet that is really good is the Mango Lassi, a yogurt drink!",

For example, a normal movement would warrant little or no Indian-food respect, subsequently, no stars. On the other hand..  There's the Cleveland Trembler; a violent ass-quake followed by a shit-tsunami only a large (and very sick) farm animal is capable of. The Trembler gets a full five stars.  Well, where is Dehli in the whole scheme of things? So glad you asked. Dehli has never made the Trembler, but it IS darned close.  The baingan bharta prepared to spice level eleven will send yer IBS straight into overdrive. In fact, all their dishes prepared to eleven will pretty much fuck you up for a good day or so.  If I'm in the mood for Indian, I typically visit Delhi on Saturday night, this so I have an excuse to get out of Sunday Costco and all that other husband/father shit expected of me on my only day off.  Why? Because even a day off with the shits is better than a day off fixing stuff around the house, shopping, or the all-too-familiar query:      \"Is that all you're going to do today? Lay around on that damned couch?\"  I",

The service of this place is very poor. I believe the servers should be given some training on how to interact with guests, how to behave with them, how to serve them. But no, the owner doesn't care about it. It happens with me all the time, the servers \"hands-me\" the plates, bowls, curries, breads everytime without fail, insteading of keeping it on the table even when I am in the middle of my meal.   And the most irritating thing, they always ask you to pay while you are eating. ALWAYS! Why can't they wait for me to finish and then let me ask for the cheque or if it can't be avoided, why can't they be courteous while asking for it. Last time when I went there, the same thing happened and instead of complying, I complained, asked the server that I wanted to speak to the manager. This really spoils *the* experience for me.  I keep going back to this place since it is walking distance from my place, but after the last time, never going back!",

    "text": "This place is a delight. I have been coming here since 2005 and its a hidden little gem in a strip mall on Rural and University next to the FedEx Office. The staff is friendly and always ask me how I'm doing and how work is going. The food is delicious. They do a great lunch buffet every weekday from 11am to 2:30pm - til 3pm on the weekends - and the variety keeps me coming back. The items on the vegetarian portion of the buffet change every day. Yes the buffet is divided by vegetarian and meat options, which make a good place to take those of the non meat persuasion. On any given day, you could try some great spicy vegetable biryani, some delicious lentils or dal, some creamy and savory palak. Or it could be vegetable korma, aloo ghobi, bombay potaties, aloo eggplant, vegetables, pakoras, salad and more.  The meat portions of the buffet always includes the best chicken tikka masala in the Valley (even better at dinner!), yummy tandoori chicken, and a selection of curries, from goat to chicken and lamb vindaloo.  At dinner, the menu is more family style, where you get a large portion of the item and and you can order naan or rice on the side. The menu is more expansive at dinner, includes items like chicken biryani, which is delighful and many more curries and types of aloo. There's a few times Ive made extra rice at home and come just to pick up some tikka to take home and got comped the rice. At lunch, they give you endless naan as well.  Ambiance wise, they recently redid the interior with murals depicting India and its very inviting.  Bottom line, great staff, lovely decor and ambiance. Delicious food at dinner and lunch make this place well worth checking out.",

    "text": "I'm going to separate my review into two parts for the reader's convenience. First is lunch, second is dinner.  Lunch: Great, cheap north Indian food buffet, highlight is definitely the Chicken Tikka Masala. The lunch buffet has a large number of options, though, so if you're feeling adventurous, go nuts. After a few years of eating here, I have one piece of advice for you: avoid the goat. I've never had a visit where it's tasted good, and with so many options, why ruin the meal? The price is fairly cheap for an indian food buffet of this quality, and when you factor in that it is all-you-can-eat and that the naan is limitless, Delhi Palace's lunch buffet is a thing of legends amongst the ASU community.   Dinner: This takes the food of the lunch buffet and makes it better (and it was already good to start!). Plus, you get to customize the spiciness of pretty much all the dishes, and you get a much larger variety of foods to choose from. Pro tip: If you are authentic desi and want desi spice, you'll need to really make sure your waiter knows. For people who aren't fond of eating raw jalepenos, stick to medium or lower. Prices for dinner can get expensive fast, and service is often slow, which is why I am giving this place 4 stars.   TL;DR Lunch is cheap, plentiful, authentic, and tasty. Get Chicken Tikka Masala, avoid the goat, capitalize on the infinite naan. Dinner can get pricy and slow, but tastes twice as good as the already good lunch buffet, with three times the variety. If you don't like licking hot car doors in the middle of the summer, order medium or bellow spiciness.",

Then, I noticed him throwing the cups on a table next to me in hurry manner and staring at us. I don't want to come to a conclusion that this is an act of racism or fatigue but even when I told the cashier about him she said sorry and asked for the money of the buffet, though I didn't finish my half-filled plate.

Been here for both lunch and dinner and the food is solid enough here to warrant 4 stars.  Lunch is a typical buffet and the variety is generally quite good.  They also have, fairly regularly, goat curry as well, which most places don't.  It's on the bone, be careful, but the meat is tender and reminiscent of lamb.  The lunch buffet also has a few desserts (kheer!) and complimentary chai masala.  Also came here for dinner with large parties a couple times.  Service was great and the food is even better for dinner.  (No mass quantity cooking).  Our usual:  chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, saag paneer, daal, chicken curry, samosas, and loads of garlic naan.  The portions are generous and the food, all of it generally, is delicious.  The restaurant was kind enough on one occasion to offer us free gulab jamun after one big dinner, a very nice gesture.  But even without the freebies, this place still warrants a 4-star review.  The daal and chicken curry were the weakest dishes, the aloo gobi was somewhere in the middle, and the chicken tikka masala and saag paneer were excellent.  This dinner party was not so high up on lamb, but I've had their lamb vindaloo as well and it is spicy and excellent.  The interior is a tad dim.  Been that way ever since I've been going to this place.",

Found 3 hairs on our chicken briyani and still had half of plate o food left which I didn't want to finish it no more because I wonder how many more hairs I was going to find. I will post this on the news page also. This is not acceptable. The wait staff told me they don't use hair nets at all. This is unacceptable and disgusting. Just uploaded a picture! Worst dinner ever. Is not hard to wear head nets..",

Even though he'd never want me to admit it, Delhi Palace is just as good! The Aloo Gobi was AMAZING and the Chicken Tikka Masala was great (though I probably could have handled a bit more spice). Definitely get the garlic naan, as no meal is really complete without it.   The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars would have to be the price. I've heard they do have a great deal on their lunch buffet, so I'll be back again soon to give it a try!",

Add papadome crackers with your soup its completely free. The same with the salads they have the best dressing sauce. For only $4 they give you a huge salad! That filled me up quick maybe because I'm pregnant. I did order a chicken tandoori  I didn't know what it would look like and I wasn't up to having anything spicy or with their famous red sauces because  my appetite has been wack lately with this baby. They brought the Chicken and my stomach turned the waitress and waiter was so polite and understanding they took the chicken away and didn't even charge us! My fiance and son ordered a big feast of food.  So at the end they even gave us 15% off our bill it was so nice I felt bad about the Chicken so in return gave them a big tip. Honestly I can go here every single day to eat their soup, salad and papadome I'm definitely going to be stopping by here more often because its perfect for me and my appetite.",

If that were its only redeeming quality, I would still give the place 3 stars!  However, the rest of the food is also fantastic.  They're excellent at adjusting the temperature of the food for whatever suits your palate (which is great since I'm a weakling but my boyfriend likes things extra super spicy).    The garlic naan is awesome, and a staple of our visits in addition to the palaak paneer.  We usually order a lamb dish and a chicken dish along with the rice, and trust me there's leftovers each time.  The vegetable pakora is great, as well, and I've enjoyed several of their other vegetarian dishes from time to time.    I can't speak to the authenticity of the place, as I've never been to India, but I can speak to what tastes great, and this place is it!",

The saag or palak dish(not sure) was tasty but I found the baingan bharta to be too sweet for me. The rice was ok not overcooked.  For dinner I usually order the paneer tikka masala and garlic naan and this time we also ordered the chole. Both of which were tasty and hot. The naan was delicious and oddly enough, mixing the gravy from the chole and paneer tikka masala resulted in a delicious tasting curry. The chole does have ample raw onion in it, so if you don't like raw onion let the waiter know. I personally like it so it wasn't a problem. They offer a complimentary dessert of rice kheer(rice pudding) with a gulab jamun in it. I was a little skeptical as a I don't care for rice kheer but together with the gulab jamun it was pretty tasty and I ended up finishing it.  Overall I enjoyed the food, the owner was very polite and nice, as were the wait staff, our glasses were filled all the time and the owner came personally to each table to ask how the food was which I really appreciated.",

I couldn't tell you what I had other than there was green food, yellow and red. For the price, I felt it was a great deal. I think my favorite was their toasted flatbread brushed with butter and garnished with cilantro. My second time in I had brought a date. We had wonderful entree's.

They also serve a hot tea and I am not sure what it is called but it goes really well with the spicy food.  When I am not dining for lunch the mushroom bhajee or seafood tandooris are  my dishes of choice. Don't fool yourself into thinking the veggie options are going to be good for you. Most of their dishes are loaded in cream, ghee or paneer so diner beware, it is easy to pack in over 1,000 calories in a sitting.. Make sure to top it off with a flying horse lager.

I was also a bit cautious regarding the service since my friends had a harrowing time with the management (A tale for another day). Once seated, the waiter-cum-floor manager impatiently prodded us for the order (5 times in a gap of 5 minutes). Irritated already, we hurried and went for Onion Pakoras for starters, few Rotis, Paneer Masala and Aloo Gobi for the main course.  The Decor was boring and dull with rolls of curtain carelessly hanging from the walls. Since Aesthetics hardly matter to me, I ignored it.  The food did not arrive for 25 minutes and neither did the pesky waiter. Looking around, we found all the waiters having a great time sharing anecdotes and sipping on a drink.  Finally after 30 minutes, the main course arrives without the starters being served. I could not imagine what excuse the management could give when we were the ONLY customers in the restaurant!   The food was good, curry was done with medium spice just like we ordered. The naans were just about right although the mango lassi wasn't the best. Overall we were pleased with the food. Just when I was thinking that the place wasn't too bad, the waiter interrupts us, hands over the cheque and asks us to pay immediately since the cash register was \"closing\". I was *stunned* ! We had just started with our meal !!! Although I was furious, I politely replied that the payment will be done soon after we are done.  10 minutes after, the floor-manager takes time off from chatting with the staff and with all the \"courtesy\" asks us to pay up soon. That was it! We quickly gobbled the food, paid and left the place in disgust!   The food was worth 3 stars but I will never ever visit Delhi Palace again, not now, not ever! For a good Indian meal I would suggest visiting 'Chutneys' , 'Kabab Palace', or even drop by my house, you will not be disappointed!",

We placed the order in the front counter. We were in a hurry and at 5 pm I went up and asked one of the waiter (in the front counter) how much time it would take and to cancel the order if it is late. The waiter behaved really rudely and said it would take 5 more minutes. Later on he was constantly taunting me. At one point he came over to our table, offered water and then just walked pass without even pouring the water in our glass. I got really pissed of him. The order finally came at 5.20 pm and I lost my calm and said it didnt took 5 minutes. He had my credit card in his hand which he threw at me and said just take the samosas we wont charge you. I said no we are not going to take it charge the card first and I am going to complain this attitude. Then he did charged the card and we left.  So the main thing -- PATHETIC SERVICE. I hope they have cameras at the front counter and the owner can see what their waiters do when they are not there. Wont be going there ever.  Avoid this place. No courtesy and their food is pathetic. They should go and learn how to offer appropriate service from a neighboring Indian restaurant \"Curry Corner\" (which has way better food than them).",

    "text": "I had the lunch buffet a while back. I didn't really have high expectations because a lot of Indian food in the US tends to be westernized. But I was pleasantly surprised. There was a lot of variety - some great chicken and mutton(goat) dishes, along with a number of vegetarian options. The palak paneer and dal makhani were in particular very good. They brought freshly baked naan to the table too. The flavors were authentic and not watered down. Taking out a star because I felt the deserts were pretty lackluster and could have done with more variety. But all in all - well worth the price!",

One note; if you order through Yelp (or perhaps other online ordering site), they seem unclear about whether they received your order. I witnessed this repeatedly while waiting for mine (a little bit longer than it should have been). Just go with appropriate expectations. They're nice guys, and the food is good.",

The lunch buffets, no matter which day we have gone, have always proven to have such a large variety. No surprises here. Just good Indian cuisine.  The prompt and attentive service is what really differentiates them from every other place we have visited. The wait staff never ceases to fill and refill our plates with a generous amount of naan bread. And the drinks are refilled promptly. Some could say that their continual visitation could be perceived as annoying and bothersome. But, in comparison to other places, there is a very distinct difference.  The food is decent, not stupendous, but good. The service is even better. And the prices are decent as well. They have to, since most of their weekday clientele are ASU students. They would not survive long if they priced themselves out of their primary market.",

Today the woman who has been there for a while, and the man who has been there even longer, were their usual welcoming selves, but the tall young man we've recently seen there surprised us with his carelessness.  When he cleared our dinner plates, he swooped them into the air and allowed our utensils to drop onto the table.  Later, when he brought our check, he just threw the folder down and walked away.  We had smiled at the falling utensils, but the check delivery made his attitude seem like more of a pattern.  His indifference isn't typical of our experience with the staff at this restaurant, and we hope he will improve his interactions with customers.",

Something strange has happened in the last few months, the prices have all increased 2-3$ each and it's not reflected on the menu. My aunt picked up our order and the man at the register told her it was going to be $92. For 5 entrees, 3 rice and 3 orders of plain naan. When she asked for a receipt he said something along the lines of \"Ok, ok, 85 then.\", but refused to give her an itemized receipt. I called when she got home and asked for an itemized receipt and he was very abrupt, bordering on rude. When I showed up he had an itemized ticket written out very neatly, not the original scribbly ticket that was waved at my aunt. I'm really disappointed. I'll wait a few months and go back and maybe things will be better/more consistent by then.  (Also we were given and charged for 4 orders of rice when I ordered only 3. Wouldn't be a big deal except the rice is 3.5$ each. And I only wanted 3.)",

The food was delivered on time and came in a Chinese food container (???) as well as a transparent round container, but wrapped thoroughly with plastic wrap.  Came with some yogurt sauce which I wasn't expecting - nice surprise.  Did notice that the rice was slightly under-cooked, so wasn't particularly pleased with that, but didn't ruin the dish too much.  The tikka marsala was really, really thin and didn't really have the consistency that I was expecting.  Had good flavor and spice as well as the cubed chicken did pairing well with it.  Had plenty of leftovers and fridge'd them.  Second go at it for a lunch the following day after heating up was actually better than when I initially at it.  It seemed like the tikka marsala thickened a bit with some refrigeration and after heating the rice and lamb up, it was slightly more cooked to how I was initially expecting it.  TLDR: Wasn't too bad, but unfortunately leftovers after a night to settle and a microwave to finish cooking rice made it better.",

I've always been a bit wary of buffets worried about quality, but the food here tastes totally fresh. All the items were loaded with flavor. The 1 star reviews without much substance frustrate me, because I believe this deserves a 5 star rating.   They seem to have some different options daily. The Mango chutney with the vegetable fritters was amazing. The service was subdued and polite as I would expect in Indian culture. I believe there may be room for a bit more proactive engagement. I think many people are unfamiliar with Indian cuisine, and that engagement could help those individuals feel more comfortable.   The decor is nice. There was definitely an effort made to give it a feel that I would call classy Indian.  Without hesitation I can say I will be back!",

I do enjoy Indian buffets though because you can try a little bit of everything. Delhi palace has a good buffet with a wide variety of dishes and quick turnover so it's generally always fresh. They also bring fresh garlic naan to your table, probably my favorite part of Indian cuisine.",

    "text": "Hello, my name is Jeremy and I'm an addict.... I am NEVER going to quit! My stomach is blind and loves all foods. Today, Indian! Delhi Palace is very good. I have enjoyed every dish. If you are a beginner I truly recommend a dish called Chicken Tikka Masala. It is a real starter dish and is a mainstay on almost every Indian menu. It is fragrant, creamy, rich and warming. It is not spicy. That's just a tip for newcomers. For foodies and ethnic eaters do try the Karahi Goat very hot. It is delicious. Vegetable Korma quells the heat a little. The Paneer here is some of the best I have tasted. Fresh, firm and creamy. Daler Mehndi the \"Punjab Pimp\" is humming beats in my head now. I must go , my food has arrived. Oh, I love when reps bring me free lunch.  Please, do not forget the Naan. I hope you enjoy.",

    "text": "We went here tonight for dinner, and the whole experience was just a notch above median. We picked this place through Yelp, and though we cook Indian food (I'm Indian) at least 3 days a week, sometimes we crave for restaurant Indian food. We ordered the mixed grill plate for appetizers and chicken tikka masala and naan for the main course. The mixed grill plate comprised of kabobs (both seekh and tikkas of chicken, lamb and beef) laid on a THICK bed of sauteed onions and a couple of lemon wedges. It arrived sizzling hot, and several people turned their heads to see where that szzzzz sound was coming from!  I dug into it with my mouth salivating in expectation, but it was a rude shock. The chicken was dry to the mouth. The seekh kabobs were overpowered with spices (mainly red pepper), and the quantity--so abysmal! The bed of onions probably weighed more in quantity than the meat. The tikkas were standard fare...oily and spicy gravy, with cubed pieces of chicken. The place is good for students, because it's so close to ASU, but otherwise, I don't think I will go back there again!",

I drove from mid-scottsdale to try this location out and I am glad I did.  It was absolutely delicious.  I did find that the selection was a bit small for the lunch buffet, but with the never-ending naan and basmati rice and the Indian tea I was blown away.  This place was my perfect fix for Indian.  I am planning on making this a usual haunt for lunch and dinner.  Also, the price was VERY reasonable.  $12 for all you can Indian was more than I could have asked for, especially given the prices at other restaurants.

The buffet does offer many choices, and it's a great stop for lunch, if your standards for Indian food are fairly low.  I eat Indian food quite often at a variety of restaurants, so I have high standards.  The prices here for entres are about average (just under $10) for Indian.  The rice and naan must be ordered separately, which is also not uncommon.  The service certainly was prompt, and that is appreciated.  In fact, it seemed like we had two waiters last night, as two gentleman brought us food, refilled our drinks, and checked in on us.  The disappointment came from the quality of food.  It did not taste fresh.  The basmati rice was somewhat hard, which may mean it was overcooked or old.  The malai kofta that I ordered, usually a fool-proof dish, also tasted chewy and somewhat old.  One of my companions was very happy with her chicken curry.  The other companion was very disappointed with the yoghurt masala, which she said was devoid of any solid food and was much too spicy for \"mild\" as requested.  If you're near ASU, I suppose it will have to do, but there are many tastier options in the same plaza/strip mall.  I would not come back if I could avoid it.",

She says she wants to come here everyday from now on. I want to come back during their buffet hours to see if I might like this spot more. The dinner prices are sort of high even with the 15 percent discount we were given cause we almost left with just a menu but the discount kept us there. I don't like how the rice is sold separately. My dish without the rice was about 13 bucks and the rice was another $3. Thats pretty pricey for a dish that didn't taste that great.

    "text": "Delhi Palace is definitely my favorite Indian restaurant in Phoenix. Located very close to ASU, I used to come here all the time while I was in school. They have a great lunch buffet everyday, then they are closed for a couple of hours before re-opening for dinner. As expected, the quality of the lunch buffet is slightly lower than the dinner meals, because the food is made in giant batches rather than prepared on demand. It's still delicious, don't worry!  I love that they rotate their selection so you always get something different at lunch. The classics stay the same - chicken tikka masala, lamb, rice(s), vegetable fritters. They always have vegetarian dishes and some vegan options as well. Garlic naan is delivered to your table throughout your meal. The lunch buffet includes chai tea and dessert (rice pudding anyone?!).   I like to come here for dinner when I'm with a group of people, so we can order a variety of dishes and share. Service is always great and they'll remember you if you come here as often as I do! Try the lunch buffet, then bring your family here for dinner. You won't be disappointed!",

This restaurant made me break my own rules.  The food is incredible.  Truthfully, it is on par with Gaylord in Chicago, and if you know Indian cuisine, you know what that means.  Reminiscent of some of the great comfort fare on Devon even, again Chicago, the decor is authentic and welcoming, the food is rich and inviting and the service is warm and friendly.    It starts with the Chicken Tikka Masala.  This dish inspires more arguments than elephant vs, donkey, because there is no wrong or right way.  It is up to the individual chef's interpretation.  In the southern regions of India, you will find more of a tomato base with peppers.  Not wrong but..not what I love.  If you love that rich, spicy, flavorful, creamy dish so many do, it is HERE.  You know the color, bright orange, with just that perfect amount of cream.  The underlying sweetness is a perfect counterbalance to the desired heat and the mix of the Dhaba (cardamon, cumin, coriander, fenugreek, (and ahem, well don't expect the secrets to be revealed) mingle harmoniously allowing each layer of flavor to be experienced in one bite after another.  Of course, Tikka Masala to Indians can be considered to be what burritos are to Mexicans, a retrofitted dish suited to the tastes of the locals, but the tandoori platter and spinach (saag paneer) are a revelation.  In fact literally everything presented to us was perfection, from the papadum to the naan, and finishing with the rice pudding, the meal was one for the ages, and the price is such that you cock your head and wonder if someone managed to feed people in 2018 in a building they were running in 1998.  The value is second to none, and most importantly..  This is a CHEF owned CHEF managed place.  This means the quality is consistent, the atmosphere is unique and reliable and the respect is constant.  Don't worry about where Presidents or Senators may have eaten Indian food in Tempe-  Go here and be treated like a President in Tempe.  Twitter account not required.",

    "text": "I love Indian food! And I've had a lot of Indian food regularly though out my life in many countries. Delhi Palace Cuisine serves very good North Indian food it's as simple as that. It is reasonably priced too.  I went there for dinner with a few friends of mine after one of them boasted \"I'll take you to the best Indian restaurant in Phoenix!\" He's probably right.  We shared the food so had the beef biryani which was very good, the chicken tikka masala which was great, its a creamy dish as it's supposed to be but they didn't over do it as some places do. so don't feel guilty about ordering it. The Tandoori chicken was excellent and I'm picky about tandoori chicken. They have  a decent vegetarian section but I only tried the Palak Paneer & it was some of the best I've had; even though it's not usually my type of dish.  I didn't like the Ice tea though, it tasted like it had some special spice or something but serves me right for ordering Ice tea at an Indian restaurant. The garlic nan was good too.  The atmosphere is typical for lots of indian restaurants. It doesn't feel like a cafeteria or anything like that but it's not going to impress anyone or wow your date. But it's comfortable, relaxed, unpretentious and True/authentic to the type of restaurant. There were a few indian couples around; always a good sign.  The service was excellent; they didn't interrupt the conversation as I've found happens too often in US restaurants these days, But they were always there; prompt ready to serve & respond. I didn't feel rushed either.  In a nutshell, if you want to experience tasty authentic north Indian food and enjoy your meal & company check this place out. I'm definitely coming back.",

There was a wide variety of dishes including chicken tikka masala (my fave dish), a spinach curry, a vegetarian meatball in curry, a stewed goat dish (which was Ah mazing), and even desserts and chai tea. They also come around and bring naan to your table. All for like 9$ per person! The food here I thought was really really good, and for the price you can't beat it. I've paid double or more to eat at some other Indian restaurants around tempe, and I can honestly say that this was just as good, if not better, than those places (plus the variety of a buffet is nice). I will be back here for sure!",

    "text": "Indian was once my favorite type of food, and for years I'd eaten at many Indian restaurants in Tempe. After trying multiple Indian restaurants, Delhi Palace has my vote for the best Indian food in town. Like some other hidden gems in Tempe, it's located in a tattered looking strip mall near ASU, but the interior is beautiful. The huge murals that decorate every wall and the mellow Indian music make you forget that you're sitting 30 feet from a Kinko's.   I love the Vegetable Pakoras and the Samosas for appetizers, and the Garlic Naan is the best naan bread I've ever had. Also, they serve both Flying Horse and Taj Mahal beer- you can't go wrong with either and they both compliment the food nicely. If you're not in the mood for beer, try their Mango Lassi... it comes in handy if the food's a bit too spicy for you. : )   I've had every vegetarian dish they offer multiple times, and they're all delicious. The Palak Paneer (cheese cubes in spinach sauce) and the Yogurt Masala (veggie kofta balls in yogurt sauce) are two of my favorites. Any of the veggie dishes are great- this is the type of restaurant where a vegetarian has a lot to choose from, and won't be disappointed.  Recently I've tried one of their meat dishes- the Lamb Korma- and it was just as tasty as the veggie dishes.    The one drawback to Delhi Palace is the service has gone downhill slightly. I suspect the restaurant was sold sometime in the last 2 years... as the old staff was always bright and talkative and extra kind.  The new staff is polite and attentive enough, just a bit awkward.   The cost for dinner for two is just a bit higher than most other Indian food restaurants in Tempe, so if you want to try this place out first, go to their lunch buffet. I think it's weekdays before 3PM... It's half the price, and much of the food is the same as the dinner menu!",

When you walk inside, its like another world - all the walls are painted, there is drapery hung around, it smells good. There is some sort of shrine in the doorway and a map of India.   The staff is helpful overall (had a few misses, but since I come here often, its been a good experience). The Naan is so damn good. The potato-spinach dish that i\"ve been calling 'saag' but is really something else is a dish I crave.   Be cautious of the spice ratings here..it varies but more than once i've asked for 'medium' and gotten 'omg-hot'.   Call ahead for take out :)  [Edit 9/1/07: I'm sorry to say that I had to drop the stars on this place. The past three times I've eaten there, the Naan has been obviously dry, somewhat stale. I'm certain that its the same naan that they had leftover from the lunch brunch meal.  They don't seem to have much business during the summer (like most az places) and seem to be resorting to cost saving measures. Either way, the naan has been sucky and that's affected my enjoyment of the meal. I'm going to stop going here. ]",

The moment we sat down he was hurrying us for the order, after asking for some time he returned within ten seconds flat and 20 seconds when requesting again for some more time. After all that he started pestering us to pay the bill even before we were half way through our meal. We said we would pay once we are done but he returned saying that he had to close some register.

    "text": "Delhi Palace is an Indian food restaurant located in Tempe Arizona.  When Emmett and I visited it, it was really empty for a Saturday night and we were seated within seconds. After being seated the pre meal snack was brought out by our waiter, a small Indian woman with a thick accent. It looked like the bread had been left out in the sun for days and someone threw sunflower seeds on it. The taste was even worse than the looks of it; the brittle bread had a rather bitter and revolting taste. There was a baby food looking sauce that also came out with the bread, but when you put it on the bread it only intensified the terrible taste. After tasting such a terrible starter, we decided to only get appetizers just in case the rest of food tasted the same. We asked the waiter what she recommended, but she had no idea what the menu even consisted of. She had to go get one of her co-workers to come tell us what he preferred; we ended up ordering Chicken Pakoras: deep fried chicken and Assorted Snacks: Vegetable Pakoras, Samosa, and Chi Panora.  The food came out decently quick and was surprisingly a very small portion even for an appetizer. The Chicken Pakoras were just basic deep fried chicken, nothing special at all. They were a little bland, but there was a dark syrupy dipping sauce that gave it some flavor. As for the Assorted Snacks, they were just as bad as the starter food. I took one bite and was hit with a bitter taste that I had to chase with water to get out of my mouth. I thought I might have just had a rare strong nasty flavor in that bite, so I decided to try another bite to only taste the same gross flavor. Overall, Delhi Palace was an overpriced Indian food restaurant that serves disgusting food. It was so bad that I had to go to another restaurant to get food that I could actually eat without gagging. The service is decent, but it cannot make up for how bad and overly priced the food was. I will most likely never recommend this restaurant or return to it again.  I now realize why the restaurant was so empty on a Saturday night.",

What awaits you inside will make you forget everything you have ever known and loved... you will want to sit there and eat until you can eat no more.  The buffet is a great value and the food is consistently fresh and delicious.  I have been going here since I was a young teenager and have always loved it.  But, the ultimate proof of their quality and authenticity came when I took my two friends who grew up in India and were visiting Phoenix for the weekend.  They thought it was excellent.  If you go to the buffet try everything.  If you go there for dinner, I highly recommend the Chicken Makhani.  Do not miss out on this gem.",

I also ordered some mango yogurt drink which in itself could have constituted a meal.  The drink was delish! The other thing I enjoyed was the endless supply of naan!  The few buffet items I tried were very tasty and am bummed that I could not sample the others.  No complaints about the food.  The buffet plus drink totaled around $13. Keeping that in mind, I probably will not return due to my very frugal nature.",

Unfortunately, we left wholly unsatisfied.   I'm no Indian connesseur, but I like my food hot yet with some flavor.  This was more just pouring red pepper in my mouth. The decor was standard strip mall Indian - mirrors and murals.  The service was fine but the food was just meh. There's no reason to trek out here if you're craving good Indian food - unless your sole goal is to make you nose run and clear your sinuses.",

Good choices for meat-lovers and vegetarian people. The quality of the food is not excellent or bad, i would say it is okay. However chicken tikka masala was okay I usually have it in my plate and it is not spicy. I also had chicken keema (I hope that what's called) and i put it in my plate too, good choice. I didn't like the tandoori chicken.  I had both types of rices, white and yellow with veggies and the yellow rice is better. As for dessert, kheer was not good. BUT, the mango custard dessert was fantastic and fabulous. I liked it very much!   What I didn't like was the decorations that made everything close to darkness and then when you leave the restaurant, the suns is very bright and hot and it feels like you came out from a cave.   I would give this restaurant a three stars but the price of the buffet made it to four stars. Would come again if I wanna fill my stomach during the day.",

Vegetable curry, I  am not sure which kind it is, some like cheese cubes (does not taste like tofu) in a creamy yellow curry sauce with some mixed vegetables.   Sheesh Kabob (3 pieces) are a little dry and overcooked for my own preference, and I think they are lamb, not beef. Chicken and Lamb Tikka were cooked perfectly.  2 pieces of Tandoori Chicken (drum and thigh).  I ordered mango lassi, not knowing I will have whole table of food.  I can barely finish my mango lassi, hence I did not try coffee and tea.    I got to-go box to pick leftover, which is more than enough for next day lunch.  I will come back next time for sure to try tikka masala.",

    "text": "This is a review based on their lunch buffet, as that is the only thing I have had. I would give it 3.5 stars if Yelp let me, but I guess Yelp hates nuance so I can't.   Tbh I feel like appreciating the buffet at this restaurant comes down to modulating expectation. If you're expecting a really REALLY good buffet, then you may leave disappointed; I was going b/c I am going to every Indian buffet in this area, and I left feeling like I had not wasted any money, but also that it was not going to become my go-to.   The good: apparently bottomless naan brought to the table, a little less expensive than other similar buffets in the area, very attentive service, good variety for the price (all of the North Indian buffet standards - mixed veg curry, dal makhani, rice, veg pakora, palak, probably something else I forgot), tasty desserts, chairs lower to the floor than normal (great for me, a very short person), location just a stone's throw down University Dr from ASU's main campus   The eeh: There was good variety of veg options (and it looked like they had the pretty standard meats, including one goat) but the mixed vegetable curry honestly was kind of tasteless? Like it left a nice residual heat, but it kind of tasted like nothing on first impression. And in general the quality of the food was GOOD, but not phenomenally so. Also, the whole restaurant felt really dark, like in literal physical terms, b/c there were big curtains drawn across the windows. This isn't really a big deal, and probably it's a very practical thing here in the so-called valley of the sun (which, as an east coast boy, I am still not used to), but it did feel a little depressing to ME, personally.   That said, there's apparently a 15% discount on dinner items for ASU students so will I come back for the buffet? Probably not. Will I make this my go-to when I want to order North Indian food that I won't find at a buffet? Yeah, at least to try it.",

For dinner, I came with a party of four right at the beginning of their service and they already had a large party, so their service (while very pleasant and accommodating) was a bit slow. Their malai kofta was one of the better, if not the best, versions I've had in the Valley, though. Everything else was solid with good spice levels.  I was very satisfied with their lunch buffet, which while small, has a lot of solid veg and non veg dishes including some amazing pakora (which has to be difficult to keep crispy on a buffet line.) and some really wonderful desserts. Awesome value for under $10, even with no samosa and slightly dry (but seemingly bottomless) naan.  I don't think I'd go out of my way to eat here, but I will definitely swing by again for the buffet if I'm in the neighborhood or someone suggests. I bumped it to five stars because the great value and I can't understand why some people are down on this place.",

There appeared to be some sort of large cloth rolled up on the kitchen floor that members of staff were stepping over.  I was not at a distance near enough to get a good enough look to exactly identify what it was.  Still, I would question the cleanliness of their kitchen and wonder if the local health department needs to visit and check for something possibly lurking about.

Food arrived and wow, for the money paid it was So NOT WORTH IT!!!!  the chicken curry 11.00 and did not come with rice or pita or anything!!  We called the restaurant back and asked about the ruce. They blew us off and stated \"it did not come with rice\" and they were not interested enough to continue the conversation. WHAT!!!!!!!! what about the customer?? If we are not valued, then our money and orders will go elsewhere!!!!",

That would be OK if they were great, but the ground lamb dish doesn't have flavor, the chicken curry dish is filled with chopped up fatty dark meat, and the tandoori chicken is dry cooking under the heat lamp for long periods of time.  If somebody invites you here, no problem. It's not terrible. But if you want cheap Indian buffet in Tempe, you've got at least a couple other better options. And now that I think about it, it's 10 bucks with tax and drink, so hard to even call it cheap...",

Portions are average to above average for the price.  Waiters never leave your water glass empty.  The servers used to be very polite but a bit severe and serious, lately they seem friendlier and more open.  Regardless, the food is wonderful and I highly recommend.",

Half of the service men don't come by regularly but there is at least one guy who is super attentive and does pretty well about re-filling drinks and finding out if you are doing ok.  I've had many of the dishes there including their Chicken Tikka Masalla, Tandoori Chicken, Chicken and Lamb Vindaloo. The garlic naan is fantastic. The best dish of what I tried was the Tikka Masalla. The vindaloo is off somehow, it used to be my favorite dish back in San Francisco but I haven't found an Indian place here in Tempe that does it right. However, their Masalla is amazing. That sauce with garlic naan is MMMMM.  The decor is very authentic, so is the smell of the restaurant. As with a lot of good Indian places it can get kind of cloying but if you are into the Indian culture and food you can easily get past it.",

We arrived long before they were closing for lunch and was hurried to order our food and then hurried to leave. When our food arrived they brought us a madras curry instead of chicken curry and tried to force us to have it anyway and said the kitchen was closed. We explained that wasn't what we ordered and had to ask many times for them to redo it. They also forgot to bring out our rice, when we asked for it they came back with a cold rice, I'm assuming was from a buffet. This is the worst service I have ever received, they do not know how to treat their customers.",

Have the papadum and ask for the mango chutney as your appetizer. If you are so inclined, the veggie samosas are delicious with some of the tamarind sauce drizzled on top. Have some Indian Tea to drink, but save room for the Kheer for dessert.  They are also good for to-go orders and it's usually ready in minutes!",

    "text": "A little kindness goes a long way, boys.  This review is for the 3 star lunch buffet and the 1 star service.  I have to admit that I am out and out soured for most Indian buffets in that my fave one in DC, Ragaa, makes me weep how good it is.  But one of my fellow Yelp buddies said this place made her belly happy, so I gave it a try. The smells and sight of the sparkling dining room made me thing that good things were coming my way.  As I perused the buffet, I noticed that it was really geared towards quantity rather than quality.  Tandoori chicken was way overcooked (and all dark meat - not a big deal, but it seems like they are saving the white meat for something else - maybe dinner?) and the other meat dishes were just so-so.  Saag paneer was tasty, as was the daal, but both forgettable.  And the rice!  It wasn't fluffy and light like you'd expect, but a little crunchy - a sin at an Indian restaurant as far as I'm concerned!  The only True delight is the warm, hot naan that they bring by to sop up the sauce on your plate.  I could make a meal of just it, except that $10 is a little steep.  My True issue with the place is the sheer lack of kindness on the face of anyone that works there.  It's like they are pissed off that they have to serve you and want to be elsewhere.  Fine by me!  Go away and have someone else serve me that'll say \"You're welcome!\" when I say \"Thank you\" instead of scowling and walking away.  We actually got into an argument the first time I went there - we were a party of three, but a friend was coming so I asked for a table for four.  The friend never came, so we were surprised when they charged us for four buffets and then put up a fight when we asked to take the fourth charge off for a person that was never there.  Come on, man!  You served us bread and water our entire meal - you saw only the three of us.  Sad.  I have to admit, I do return to this place when friends suggest it for lunch - like a drunken hookup, I fall into it and then ask myself what I am doing once I am there.  I need to scope the valley for a new place and stop giving in to convenience of location.",

Since I moved to the Valley, I have been attempting to find a place that has food that doesn't make me miss my Mom's cooking so much.  Unfortunately, this wasn't anywhere near it.    Our service was fine- nothing friendly, he just got us what we needed when we needed it in a very abrupt, awkward way.  Our water glasses were left empty too many times for my liking.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala at a hot spiciness level.  The meal was alright.  There was no real flavor other than the hotness factor.  I was disappointed in this, naturally, as usually Indian dishes can offer both flavor and spice... not the case here.    I doubt I will ever return here, as the food really lacked the flavor that most people expect when enjoying Indian cuisine.",

I was meeting a friend for a quick, inexpensive and hopefully tasty pre-movie dinner at the Valley Art Theater on Mill.  The decor was what I would call, the \"basic, no frills cafeteria like set up\" that can be found in many Indian and Thai restaurants I have frequented.  Practical and comfortable.  The staff was friendly and welcoming and the menu had typical Indian fare. We shared the appetizers, the garlic Naan and vegetable samosas, both were an enjoyable beginning.  I love eggplant, so my go to order is the Baingan Bharta with rice and that is what I had.  It was delicious, I ordered it mild and it had just the right amount of kick.  I restrained myself from not devouring the whole meal and saved enough to take home for a full meal.  As expected, the meal was a great value of $20 with tip.  Not bad for two healthy meals.  When I am craving Indian and over near Mill, I will return to the Delhi Palace again. Namaste.",

My sister insisted that I come along with her to this Indian restaurant- Delhi Palace, for their lunch buffet. I picked her up from work and off we went.   I went through the line of the buffet carefully picking my meal. I managed to grab myself some Lamb Curry, Basmati Rice and salad. I came back to my table and the waiter served us our drinks as well as some delicious naan. Delhi Palace toasts the naan as well as adds a garlic kick. The naan arrives to your table steamy hot! I finally dug in too my food and was so pleasantly surprised. After feeling like I could take on any type of Indian food, I went back to the buffet for seconds and tried more dishes. ALL of the dishes exceeded my expectations.   I definitely recommend going to the lunch buffet it is well worth the money! More bang for your buck!   The restaurant is also very conveniently located next to the ASU-Tempe campus.

    "text": "Four times. That's how many times I have tried their food. It's delicious - at least the Chicken Tikka Masala, Peas Palou and Naan.   The first time I ordered my food over the phone. I waited the requested timeframe and went to pick up my food. It took an additional 20 minutes sitting in the restaurant for my food to come out.   The second time I ordered I did it online. I waited an extra half hour before going to get my food. It was still not ready on arrival. We had to hang out in the parking lot for another 15-20 minutes.   The third time, yes I should have already learned my lesson but my brother and sister in law REALLY wanted Indian food and I did not want to drive all the way to Indian Delhi Palace on McDowell. So I relented and I ordered online again. I waited 30+ minutes before leaving. Surprise. My food was not ready. We waited who knows how long. When we got home they had not given me all of my food and I HAD TO DRIVE BACK to get the rest of my PREPAID ORDER!!! He thru in an extra Naan, $4.95. Great! That absolutely does NOT cover my gas, time, energy and missed time with family!!!  You would really think I would \"cut bait\" by now. But my brother wanted Indian food ONE MORE TIME before leaving and he enjoyed his Vegetable Korma SO MUCH that he requested I go back. EVEN THOUGH I had already said I would NEVER go back. But I love my brother so I gave them another chance.  I waited 35 minutes and went to pick up out food. When I walked in the gentleman calmly went behind the curtain and pulled my order off of the fax machine. They had not even STARTED IT!! 15-20 minutes he says. 20 minutes later I go in. No food. An hour after my original order time, no food. When it FINALLY comes out I ask if it's all there. \"Yes of course it is.\"  I checked. No, I was short 1 order of Vegetable Korma and Lam order of Garlic Naan. And they gave me Sag Lamb instead of Sag Chicken, and they would not exchange it.  Unbelievable!!! I cannot believe how SLOPPY they run their business. They clearly could care less about my business. That's fine, I won't come back.",

The thing more pathetic thing was the service, the particular server, was snotty and arrogant. He was curt and had a irritated expression every time we asked for small things like, to clear the plate or refill the water ! Came out disappointed and angry. Needless to say I'm never coming back here! And some of friends have had similar experiences!!",

    "text": "I promised myself I would not write this review.  But, I couldn't even keep this promise to myself.  My eating partner told me I owed the world this review considering that money is tight and people need to know what they are getting or not getting for their money. The staff was friendly upon our arrival and we were seated expeditiously.  Not too crowded for a Saturday night, hmmmmm.    My eating partner wanted to sit next to me instead of facing me so he began to move the placemat & silverware to the other side.  The waiter trying to be helpful, put all five of his fingers, on what was destined to be my plate, and swished the plate next to the other plate.  Helpful, but I was somewhat concerned about where those five fingers had been last.  i was soooo self disciplined that  didn't say a word, but I did use antibacterial hand cleaner on my plate.  With mersa and other types of infections abounding, I didn't want to take a chance.   Papdum came with coriander chutney.  Crispy and plentiful. The chicken biryani served to us had a strange color.  Very very red, as if cooked with tomato paste. Spicy as we asked but with no flavor.  Just heat.  We like the heat but the food has to be tasty.  (I thought of the delicious biryani that we could have had had we driven to our old stand-by that was further away from our house.)  What a difference a couple of miles makes.  Then the Chicken Vindaloo that was ordered spicy, was delivered spicy but with no flavor.  Indian spices were not strong enough; just chicken in a red sauce.  Even the tartness that vindaloo sauce requires was missing. Vindaloo is one of those sauces that contains a little bit of vinegar (just check any indian cookbook).  The tandoori roti was good as was the complementary yogurt sauce.    The people are nice enough but the food is probably one of the least favorite I have had in the valley (I was going to write worst, instead of least favorite but that would not be very nice).   Suffice it to say that my Saturday night dinner was less than tasty and certainly less than memorable.   Moral of the story:  Drive a few extra miles and go to a place where you know you will get excellent food at a fair price. It will be worth the drive. (Did you read this dear eating partner???)",

Do yourself a favor skip the buffet and go for dinner.  Buffets do not hold the same quality as individual meals.  The benefit of a buffet would be to experience as much as the restaurant has to offer. If you do go, you must get the traditional Delhi dish Murgh Makhani (ButterChicken). This dish supposedly was invented in old Delhi and became famous at a restaurant there. It is a butter tomato masala sauce that takes time to make correctly. You seriously will not be disappointed.  I am salivating right now thinking about it. Get a couple orders of garlic naan.  Get some Indian tea, basically a chai tea with milk. Venture out of you comfort zone and try any of the dishes you see on menu.   On your way out the door stop for just a few fennel seeds to clear you pallet and ease digestion. I will continue to return to for the awesome food and the cheeky, tacky decor and bad lighting.",

    "text": "You will probably have a hard time finding this place. But it is well worth turning on the GPS.  This little restaurant is one of many interesting-looking finds in the strip mall, and the first time I met my friends there we all got hopelessly lost looking for it. It's a quaint little place, with low-lighting and friendly waiters. The food is great and pretty reasonably-priced.   The first time I went here, we tried their combination platters (we were all on seperate checks) and they were both 1) delicious and 2) well worth the price. It's definitely a nice option for someone who likes to try a bunch of things but maybe is with people who aren't used to 'family style'!  The second time, I was with my family so we got a bunch of dishes.We tried the palak paneer (pretty good), lamb biryani (excellent), saag chicken (excellent), chicken mushroom (good), roti (okay), garlic naan (excellent), and poori (excellent.)  They brought us some complimentary papadum and some fritters (didn't know what these were) for dinner, which is always good, and very nice of them!  Definitely try their curries, and lamb biryani (by far my favorite) which came with its own little side dish of raita to help take down the spice. We kept things at \"medium\" level, but you can customize from mild-hot depending on your temperment.  The palak paneer was my least favorite, but that could have been because I ordered it mild (to mix it up a bit) and it didn't pop in flavor as well as the others.  Also, my sister and I loved the poori, which was a deep-fried wheat bread. It tasted like fry bread and was excellent for soaking up sauces.   Service was very attentive and it never took long for a chai or water refill.  All in all, great service and food and I will be back!",

    "text": "I have been here twice so far, both ventures for the afternoon buffet. The second trip came recently to confirm the quality as I remember being blown away the first time, and had another great experience. I am excited to start eating here more often as it is on the way to school.   Until like 2:30 pm, they have an all you can eat buffet for around $9, and a guy like me is fully capable of devouring 3-4 entrees in order to get full. So this is the basis for my review as I may or may not make it in for dinner any time soon due to my schedule.   I started the game picking out a little sample of everything offered, and then was planning to take it from there eliminating what I didn't like as I went up for seconds. I absolutely loved it all, but only went back up for a few items due to being (surprisingly) full. Although I enjoyed the grilled veggies, I would have to put them on the side next time as they didn't mix well with the chicken curry and masala items. That was my bad though, as I had chosen... poorly with my plate composition.  I will gradually update this review as I learn more info about the dishes, I plan to start going here a lot for lunch and will be more vigilant about what is what.",

    "text": "Well, I used to LOVE this place. I love indian food- it's my absolute favorite. The food is really good here and reasonably priced and is in a good area of Tempe for students . The vegetarian dinner is delicious and the garlic naan is AMAZING. I wouldn't usually come for the lunch buffet because it's a little less spicy than I like it.  A few months ago they hired this new waiter who is completely incompetent. He's super awkward and had us waiting for ~35 minutes to take our order and another ~20 for the food. The crazy thing is that the place was totally empty when we got there! There was one other couple. The food was good (as usual) but we were so turned off by how long everything took that I gave the guy full tip but wrote \"bad service\" on the receipt, thinking maybe he just needed to know that we noticed he was just standing around and taking instead of taking our orders and serving us. I always tip well because I think people under value their servers, but jeez this guy was terrible!!  So then we go again a few weeks later and apparently he remembered us because he started talking to all the other people who work there about how we were rude when it came to the check (maybe he forgot that I tipped him 20%?) and we had awful service again and he made someone else who worked there serve us. It was so incredibly awkward that I felt like hiding under the table and we haven't gone back since. It's really sad because this was one of my favorite restaurants.",

Delhi Palace is now my new favorite Indian cuisine restaurant in the PHX area, so much that I don't miss Orlando.  I'll definitely be back even more times in the future to try more dishes.    The staff has always been quick and courteous, despite not always speaking English that well.  The food is the real draw.  It's fantastic!  My favorite is the Fish Masala.  Give it a shot!",

    "text": "Hadn't been here in years and wanted to come back because I had good memories of this place being really good. However, we were very disappointed. The quality and taste of the food had diminished and the service was a bit odd. The server wasn't attentive and the taste of the food we ordered (chicken vindaloo- bland; samosa- disappointing; and lamb curry- bland) were not what we remembered it being. Will not be coming back here anymore. At least there's many Indian restaurants around the valley to try...",
