Never refilled our drinks, and never cleaned up spills. People waiting watch you eat, which is never fun. A little tightening up of the cleanliness and attentiveness to customer service, and I'd go back based on the beer selection alone. Pizza is salty.",

    "text": "After the bad reviews others have posted, I was really unsure what to expect. But I was VERY PLEASANTLY surprised!  The dough/crust is FANTASTIC - flavorful, and just the right crispness without being hard and burnt. It tastes like it might be almost-whole-grain. Not excessive, as in gritty, but just a bit chewy, in a good way.  I had a Fun Guy pizza (yeah, I know, lol) - LOTS of mushrooms - 5 different types - and lots of cheese. Brought home the leftover, and it was just as good reheated the next day.  The service wasn't bad for our large group of 8, although they did screw up the order a bit. We ordered TWO Fun Guy pizzas, but they only brought one. Not a big problem, we simply shared the first while waiting on the second.  The only weird thing is that many of the beers on the extensive beer list are served in CANS - I do NOT like canned beer. For example, all the New Belgium beers, like Fat Tire, which is one of my go-to beers.",

After reading the reviews my expectations were low but my Groupon addiction had gotten the better of me and I had to spend the Groupon I bought a few months back. Boyfriend and I headed in on a Sunday night. The place is huge and it was kind of empty so seating was not an issue.   We ordered BBQ wings and a sausage pizza. Seeing as it wasn't that busy we started to wonder when we didn't get our wings. Then we got our pizza. Hmm. So I said \"we had wings too.\" The waiter went back to check and we got or wings in just a few minutes. We didn't complain (they didn't come out that late, really) but they offered to take half off the wings for the mix-up. Nice service!  The pizza had a nice chewy crust, not too much sauce and a decent amount of cheese. If you like lots of sauce you may want to request extra. The crust was kind of buttery and reminded me of the crazy bread at Little Caesars - yum! The wings were a little on the small side but had a good flavor to them.  So while I can't say it was the best pizza ever it was good enough that I'd eat it again for sure.",

    "text": "Good evening Yelpers, this is a live action review of the newest pizza joint on Mill. So far they are batting one star. The waitress didn't show up for 10 minutes and after failing to know what their seasonal draft beers were, her response to a question regarding the house wine was \"I'm not sure, it has a tree on the label.\" Stay tuned.  Update. A few minutes have gone by since we ordered drinks and the waitress comes back not with our drinks but to ask us to remind her what we ordered. Still batting one star.   First course is up! Never mind, she brought the wrong size salad. Come on Mellow Mushroom! I want you to be good, I really really do.  Pizza has been devoured. Has the service continued to be awful? Absolutely.  Was the pizza good? Yes yes and yes. The meat pizza was as good as it gets. The cosmic karma pizza was delish. The fun guy pizza was the slow kids of the trio but held its own.  The pretzels were meh.   So the big question is, how many stars did the food recover from the atrocious service?  I'm going with three. Four star food and one star service.  Now to be fair, this place has only been open for a week and most likely just has some kinks to work out.  I will likely return and will most definitely keep this place in mind when thinking of take out.  As you were.",

I ate at a high table in the bar area, and it was adult contemprary rock chic. The staff was pleasant and the service was reasonable.   I had the Mushroom Club and I enjoyed it. The addition of the mushroom flavor to the club sndwich was welcome. The amount of meat to bread was good, making a decent sandwich. Expect to pay $7-10 for lunch. Truthfully, three stars is on the low side, but I'm not sure I would rate it at four - more like a three and a half. I'd go again, but I'm not sure that I'll coming here for it specifcally. The biggest challenge is that it's a pretty good place surrounded by some really great places.    I would expect it to be a much better place late nights - it seems like that kind of place. I would actually like to see this place with some live music late nights.",

Our waitress was very energetic and kind.  She made conversation with us and was a great waitress.  The service was fast. They checked on us to see if we needed any more water or to ask how the food was.  Mellow Mushroom had really good food. We got half barbeque chicken pizza and the other half had olives onions and mushrooms.  Both types of the pizza had great flavor.  The food was on the expensive side, but the quality matched the price.  I would recommend eating there if you are in the area.  The restraint itself was an upbeat place.  It was lively and all the waiters and waitresses dressed very casual.  The surroundings in the restraint matched the surroundings of Mill Ave; young people with there own type of personality went there.  They are unique with artwork on the walls.",

I got a bowl of their mushroom soup ($3.99) that was surprisingly good! I was expecting something a little thinner since the menu mentioned a wine base, but it was very thick. Still tasty.   I also ordered the Philosopher's Pie pizza. Pretty disappointed in that one. The steak tasted a little funky. Overall, it just wasn't quite what I had hoped for. The crust was very good - quite possibly the best part.   All in all, gourmet prices for pizza that doesn't measure up. The soup was tasty, and I might be back for happy hour.

We got 2 pizzas, one with steak and mushrooms and one with eggs and prosciutto i believe? (I forget the exact names of them) I was really excited about the egg one but it didn't turn out as good as i thought it was going to be. It was kind of lacking in the flavor department. If there was more garlic or something it would probably be a bit better. The other pizza was alright but nothing anything too spectacular. I want to come back though one day and try out the other pizzas because I feel like I would probably find other pizzas on the menu that i would love.",

Just keep in mind that there are some beers that are not included in this happy hour but they do have a fairly extensive beer list so there's something good for everyone. This is one of the few places on Mill Ave that have reverse happy hour making this a great spot for a night out or to at least have on the rotation of places to go.  As far as the food is concerned I did share a pizza with a friend of mine and we found it to be just okay. I was more impressed with their pretzels, mainly the garlic butter + parmesan version. I feel the main draw to this place has to be both of their happy hours and at least their pretzels for the appetizers. Their garlic bread is something I would have to try on my next visit to see how that is.  Yes it can get busy here late at night but I suppose the vibe all depends on when you go. Despite it being busy here at times the atmosphere is for the most part \"mellow\" and this is a great place to hang out and have a beer.",

    "text": "Found a Groupon ($20 for $10) and decided to eat here before a gaming night with friends.  My husband and I split the wings as an appetizer and split a medium pizza.  The wings are described as crispy baked wings on the menu, but they are just baked.  No crisp to them BUT they ARE quite tasty (we got BBQ).  For the pizza my husband got the house special on his half, and I got the \"philosopher's\" something on mine.  The pizza crust was amazingly buttery crispy and chewy.  The house special side was awesome.  I didn't care for the philosophers side.  I think it was more personal than any mistake of the kitchen.  My husband loved it all.    Why five stars if the food wasn't perfect?  I don't blame the restaurant because I tried and didn't like something I have never tried before.  Also, the service was above and beyond, even though our server knew we had a Groupon from the moment we sat down.  I have been greeted with horrible attitudes and contempt in the past when it has been made known that I have a Groupon.   This guy wasn't phased at all,  he didn't treat us any differently from the large group next to us.  I'm terribly with names, but he was a bartender and we were in there on Monday 8/31 right after the storm.  We will be in there again this Monday, hopefully I will find a pizza combo I like this visit!",

We ordered two entrees for dinner.  Wife's food (avocado sandwich) was adequate.   Hopefully that was not their satisfaction goal.   I ordered a burger., and it was very disappointing.   It was clear the food sat and sat and sat and sat waiting for someone to bring it to us after it was cooked.   The Burger was merely edible.  Again, i hope that was not the bar they were looking to achieve.    The roasted potatoes were literally probably the worst food item i have ever received at a restaurant ever.   Way overcooked!!    The cook/chef that sent those abominations out from the kitchen needs to hang up his chef hat and go back to whatever career path he was really meant  to follow.   Cooking is just not for him/her.    It stinks when you leave dinner thinking- that was overall pretty terrible.   Luckily, the beer was at least cold and delicious.",

    "text": "I've been to this place a couple times (the first of which was a REALLY long time ago), and I really like it.  It kind of reminds me of a not-so-chain-feeling California Pizza Kitchen, which I know is a weird thing to say because 1) I know it is a chain & 2) I like California Pizza Kitchen (and have no issue w/chain restaurants to begin with), it's just that Mellow Mushroom has a slightly more \"homey\" feel to it.   A couple things I didn't know about Mellow Mushroom until this last time I went, but I'm glad I know now:  1) They have a a happy hour. Half price on apps & drink specials.   2) They actually have a really good beer selection! I always expect chain places like this to carry pretty standard fare, but they actually have a really big variety here. A friend of mine who I came with is doing gluten-free right now and they actually had multiple selections for her.  As far as food goes, I had hummus and a pizza. I'm pretty easy to please with hummus, and it's good a Mellow Mushroom. Nothing stands out about it (for better or worse), but it's good. I also had a gluten-free pizza, which was delicious. I know nothing about gluten-free & since this was the first time I had pizza from Mellow Mushroom I have nothing to compare it to, but I really liked the crust in particular.  Service was fine (it wasn't all that busy), and they validate parking (I really hate what the parking situation on Mill has become, which is why I rarely frequent there anymore).   I'm a fan, and I 'll be back.",

After explaining my disappointment and requesting a little break (happy hour pricing?=$2 off per beer), the manager made it seem like he was going to be fair...however, when I got the bill, about $100 later, no discounts or breaks considering their lack of availability of what was shown on the menu. For as many times as I've been here, this was the most disappointing. Server and food were good, but I would not go back for the lack of consideration by management.",

This is definitely the times we will go back over and over for.  The food is good, though not necessarily great. During previous visits, we usually ordered a pizza and a beer or two. Any other time it seems as though the cost for this is usually a but higher than I would normally like.  During HH we were able to order a couple of things off the \"Munchies\" menu. 10 wings for me (under $5) and spinach dip with pitas for him (under $4) and we were able to have about 3 craft beers each. For all this, we paid much less than if we would have just gone out for a pizza. Bonus - We used a groupon $10 for $20 and it applied during HH!!!  The tap list is pretty decent as well.. Definitely not bad for a chain restaurant. Good stuff and they seem to update on taphunter.  The staff is a bit hit or miss at times with friendliness/attentiveness, but this trip we got to meet and chat with the manager Aaron. He is a superstar!! He was so friendly and nice and made us feel so welcomed and like we were old friends/regulars! He knew his craft beer as well and was able to recommend something amazing for my hubby who gave him 2 thumbs up. I really loved his demeanor and honestly, I will return to this Mellow Mushroom again and again because of him and those HH specials!",

    "text": "I have two reviews in one, but I will start with tonight's. All I have to say is, it seems, from other reviews, that this place needs a new delivery guy.  I call to ask to get a pizza delivered - I chose mellow mushroom because they have vegan pizza (I am severely lactose intolerant) because last time I had their vegan pizza in-house, I liked it a LOT and had a craving. Due to some issues that don't need to be gotten into, I cannot go there myself and get it, so I asked for delivery.   When I told the girl where I lived (on Guadalupe), she said she thought they stopped delivery at Baseline but would go ask. The girl (who was very nice) comes back on the phone and says the delivery guy is \"in a bad mood tonight\" and said no and when she explained that I am (apparently) only 2 miles out of their zone, he said \"I don't answer to you.\" I asked to speak to the manager and she said \"he was standing right there when I asked.\"   REALLY? What the heck kind of place is this? What kind of boss stands around and lets employees talk to each other like that (from what I hear, the delivery jerk is related to the boss, so maybe that's it?)  My second review, from 2 times of actually being at this restaurant, is the same. The food, except for the vegan pizza (which is SO GOOD, but kind of on the expensive side...) isn't very good. I ordered the cinnamon honey pretzels and they were so dry they weren't edible. The garlic/cheese bread is also incredibly dry.   If they would have been willing to work with me on the delivery, I *might* have given them 3 stars, but for the bad attitude this place seems to constantly have, they only get 2. Which is really a bummer, because their vegan pizza is so good.  EDIT!!: Alright, so a few hours after I wrote this review, the general manager, Jason, called me about my review to apologize and talk with me about what happened. He apologized multiple times for the awkward situation that went down, and while he was not present when it happened, he obviously took my review seriously. He then offered to deliver a free pizza to me himself, and that if I didn't want it this evening, he would bring it any other time. I took him up on his offer and he brought me a pizza.   Being in a manager position myself, I understand sometimes what managers have to go through, and his choice to call me and try to make it right is commendable and I really appreciated it. Sometimes businesses or employees mess up, but what matters is what they do to FIX it. Jason went the extra mile.   Thanks to this, I changed my review to 3 stars. Also, this vegan pizza is amazing as always.",

They were accommodating for our large party, which was appreciated, but the drinks and the food was very slow to get to our table. I tried the white chocolate russian (good, but not great spin on the white russian) and the tequila sunrise (good, nice tequila to orange ratio). A friend and I split a caesar salad and a pizza with roma tomato, garlic, and pepperoni. The salad was pretty standard, nothing too special, but the pizza was really good. My main complaints with this restaurant include the high prices and the slow service BUT I would come back because the pizza was ridiculously good.   PS Tuesdays are 1$ PBR pint days....awesome!",

Kept drinks full (actually got ahead of us, she was so on top of things), and was kind enough to share that even on the smallest pizza, you can get half and half. Sold!  We ordered cheesy bread as an appetizer. It's just okay. Not as garlicky as we were expecting and a little over-crisp and dry.  I got the potato pizza on half and the Mega Veggie on the other half. Mega Veggie was good, but the potato pizza was outstanding.  Husband's buffalo chicken ranch pizza was also pretty good. General four-star concensus around our table. Give it a try!",

Almost all the seats at the bar counter were full and there were a few open spaces available at the tables. Our group came in (4 of us) and I saw one of the bartenders who had trays in hand, I said \"excuse me, is this the only area where we could sit?\" He glared at me and looked annoyed and just nodded. We proceeded to sit down at an empty table near the kitchen area.  We waited for someone to approach us and ask us or inform us how to order. We kept on looking at the direction of the bartender that was now at the bar but we weren't entertained. A few minutes later, one other guy with gray hair and glasses just passed by us even after one of us said \"excuse me\" and he went to the table next to us to take their empty plates. He also went to other tables on the other side talking to them and taking out their plates too. We sat there for about 15 minutes without even being acknowledged. We stood up and left. I've never experienced such blatant racism on top of such terrible service.",

The prices during both of these times were very reasonable. What i was impressed with the most was the selection of beer that they have. Being here in AZ it was the first time I have seen any Rouge beer on tap. During happy hour all drinks were half off making a delicious brew of Rouge hazelnut brown an amazing $3.50. The appetizers aren't your normal fried bar food you would find most places either. Along with my friends we split the meatball appetizer, the stuffed portobello mushroom and the oven roasted wings (medium).  The meatball appetizer came on a triangle plate with a generous helping of their red sauce in the middle. The three meatballs were cut in half and placed on skewers laying lightly in the marinara sauce. The meatball was juicy and the sauce complimented it nicely. This is a True definition of an appetizer because it was just enough to start off your meal but not enough to make you full. I would take great taste over a full stomach when it comes to an appetizer any day.   The portobello mushroom also tasted great, stuffed with cheese and spinach with a drizzle of a balsamic vinaigrette on the top of it. Once again great taste but not so filling.  The wings were excellent, with them being oven roasted the flavor of the juicy chicken and the sauce on the wings was amazing. The meat was falling off the bone.   I have also had the pizza from here and I love the creative specialty pies that are available. The pizza we had was a \"hot potato pie\" which came with potatoes, bacon, onion and a drizzle of sour cream. There was no red sauce with this pizza. The flavor combo was interesting and good. I was looking forward to eating the crust the most, it was delicious.   My recommendation is to try this place for happy hour and try a couple of appetizers off the menu with a tasty craft beer.  Quick Note: I have always wanted to come in on a Wednesday for \"WTF?? Wednesdays\" where for $3 I believe you get a mystery beer in a brown paper bag haha.",

It's not a place for those who prefer quiet \"fine\" dining, that's for sure, but it's open late and is perfect for a midnight pizza binge (my specialty!).  But as for the food, it's pretty damn good. I especially enjoyed their Maui Wowie pizza- it certainly did the job in \"wowing\" me and my boyfriend! I'm usually not a Hawaii-style pizza fan but this pizza was superb. The Philosopher's Pie is also a safe choice, but is not nearly as good. Their appetizers didn't impress me as much; it was pretty standard food for a pizza place.  Despite their mostly standard, typical taste as far as food as concerned, this is definitely the restaurant to come to for a friendly, laid-back experience that'll satisfy any pizza craving. The menu has plenty of gems; just ask a few of the regulars. The staff is cool, the place is cool, and the pizza is piping hot. Mmm.  Seriously. Just take a bite of the Maui Wowie and you'll become as obsessed as I am.",

    "text": "We've been to many mellow mushroom restaurants and have almost always had a good experience, but the one in Tempe is the worst one we've ever been to, by a long shot.  We went in on a Saturday with a group of 14 people, there were only two other tables occupied in the entire restaurant. We were greeted warmly but then it took about 10 minutes to order drinks, after we asked to order. Drinks finally came 15 minutes later, then we had to ask to order food. We didn't even get our order in until we were there for 40 minutes. While ordering, the waitress only took orders for 11 of the 14 of us, and we had to go find her to order for the other 3 people.  Our food finally came 45 minutes later, and we had only ordered 3 salads and 4 pizzas for the table which means we got got our food 1:25 minutes after getting there. Several of the orders were incorrect, especially the salads.  The worst part was my wife's salad had a twist tie in it!! We called the manager over and told him about all of the issues we'd had so far, so he agreed to take her salad and all of the appetizers we'd ordered off the check.  When we were clearly done eating, we had to track the waitress down again for the checks after another 15 minutes.  The only reason I didn't give mellow mushroom Tempe only 1 star is because the pizza was still good and the manager took the salad and apps off the check.  I would definitely recommend NOT going to this mellow mushroom.",

    "text": "Yelp Review Mellow Mushroom 740 S Mill Ave, Tempe Az (480)-967-6355  Every time I travel down Mill Ave, which is daily, the intriguing and bright multi-color sign is quick to grab my attention. My brothers have always told me Mellow Mushroom was good, but I never took them literal. I decided to try this Mellow Mushroom for the first time after school one day when my friend and I were looking for a new place to eat. My friend had heard similar reviews. We walked in and it was completely empty. There was a sign in the front that said, \"seat yourself\". My friend and I decided to sit in the back near the bar. Right away I got a fantastic vibe. There were multiple televisions mounted on the wall that had sports on, there was nice settling music in the background, and my friend and I got to sit at a high-top table. All the tables were pretty spread out to, so I had plenty of room to enjoy myself. The thing that really caught my eye was the huge disc that hangs over the bar. It really added to the atmosphere. The restaurant has a sports bar feel to it. It seems like when it's game day for football it will be packed.  It was only two minutes before we were greeted by our waiter. He was very friendly with his intro and seemed like a great waiter right off the go. He immediately told us about all the running specials and quickly came back with waters. We also got to immediately order, which was nice and didn't waste any time. He seemed to really care that we were sort of in a rush. My water also never went below half way, so I'd say the service was well. The pizza also came out fairly quick which was nice and convenient. Our waiter was also super good about getting us the check quickly. We didn't wait around one bit.  When it comes to eating pizza, I'm a pizza connoisseur. I could eat pizza every day of the week and love to try every place possible that sells any type of pizza. I decided to go original and went with a small pepperoni pizza. I could nearly smell my pizza before it came out. It came out super-hot and on my own personal dish. The pizza was cut perfectly and wasn't too messy. The taste reminded me of Peter Piper Pizza but way better. For 11.99, I expected it would be better. My favorite part had to be at the end of the slice when I got to the crust. It had a perfect crunch to it. Once I hit the final slice it was hard to get it down because of how much food came with the small portion. I can successfully say this place was a hit. I left with a stomach full of good pizza for under twenty dollars.",

It was after 10 on a Friday night, so I don't expect amazing A+++ on a night like that. But, the thing that DID suck is when I did walk up to the area to order, I had the bartender behind the counter completely not even make eye contact with me or a, \"I'll be right with you\". When he finally did look at me, he asked what I needed...then proceeded to pick up some plates, spill dirty beer ice water on me FROM said plates onto my jacket and arm, and NOT even say sorry or excuse me. Didn't catch the dudes name, but he didn't seem very interactive with people and arrogant right off the bat. Had bleach blonde hair. Shitty attitude. Unfortunate cause this place is normally my go to on mill at the beginning or end of my nights. Sad face. Say excuse me next time you spill dirty bar water on my jacket sir...it's just rude.",

We waited forever for her to return and when she finally took food orders she again took mine and my friends and then said \"will there be anything else?\".

We ordered 3 different salads and 3 different pies. Of the 3 pies I ate from the BBQ Chicken was the best flavor but I was a bit disappointed there wasn't much chicken on it. It was a half and half pizza so I know those are a pain to make when the other half is a completely different sauce. Their beer selection is decent sized, but choice of beers is kind of strange. At the very least, I found one of my favorite micro breweries on the list and had one. Oh yeah, you can get it in 12 or 16 ounce size. Yay! Our server Nike was a little quiet but dealt really well with a few of the pickier ones of our bunch. I would definitely eat here again.",

The funky Q chicken pizza is to die for. Which I imagine all of them are! But since I've eaten this pizza I never get anything else. Their appetizers aren't that great for the price though, that's the only downside. Tried the brucetta, wings, and garlic bread. Nothing great. I also recommend not to sit in the bar area preferably of you aren't there for happy hour... Service isn't that great in that area. But the dining area, I've never had an issue. The waitresses and waiters are phenomenal. Keep doing your thing Mellow Mushroom! I've even signed up for their app to gain points! That's how much I love this place!",

They made the reservation, followed up, and had the room ready when the guests arrived. They also helped me with the cake which was very cool of them. I would highly recommend this location if you are looking to have a laid back yet special occasion in the middle of the most happening area in Tempe!

LOL However, I think the Muffaletta Bread App and pizza ( that has a crust, by the way, more like a baked pretzel than a pizza) kind of killed it. I did have small servings though. :0)----- I had a great meal with great company and great service! ( thanks Kevin and cute guy with the pony tail) We did a 50 /50 pizza split with a potato mixed pizza and a Greek style. Sorry I forget the names. The pizza was very different and very delish! The subs look fantastic here too. The restaurant is very cool and hip. Lots of room to chat and relax. We went early at 3pm on a Saturday so no crowds at all. Enjoy it!",

    "text": "I have been to many Mellow Mushrooms on the East coast (Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, etc...) and was so excited to see when they opened their first one in North Phoenix. (Happy Valley location). I have been a regular customer since the grand opening.    They now have 2 other locations, one in City North and this one off Mill Ave.  I hear a rumor of another....  The happy hour specials for appetizers do not exist at this location, or its only for certain days.  I am not sure.  I guess some days you get pizza slices (on thursday nights) and others you may get the appetizers...I dunno, I will try to confirm if I go back. The beers are still half off and they are always rotating.  That is one of the things I love about Mellow.  I have eaten here a many times during non Happy Hour and it can get pricey.  Unfortunately the food is not always consistent.  I think one day they were running low on mozzarella and thus mixed it with cheddar cheese which greatly altered the taste of the thai dye pizza.  The meat pizza is usually a safe bet, but there was a time when even that was lacking.  There was good and bad days for the wings.  Service is decent.  So far no complaints there.  Ambiance is just not there for me.  I can't say I won't be back, but this is one location I will not be patronizing as much.  Its my least favorite Mellow thus far.",

The server, Dante took our preferences into account and then made suggestions.  We were quite pleased.  We continue to request him as out waiter anytime we go there and as a result we have never been stuck in a food  rut as happens with OTHER eateries.

    "text": "Got a medium pepperoni pizza for three to go. It took around 15 min which was pretty reasonable. The reason why i'm giving it 4 stars is that the employees were not very nice, a worker was smoking and drinking in the little take out area. They also seemed really young, and not too interested in helping us when we walked in to get our pizza. However, the pizza was really yummy. It had lots of cheese and pepperonis. It was a little greasy, but the crust was amazing! The crust was really crispy, but also very chewy, and the crust was also very flavorful. It had lots of parmesan cheese and garlic. Yum!",

I've been here a number of times, but decided that I needed to write a review after seeing they were only coming up as having 3 stars on Yelp.   I have always had a positive experience when I've eaten here. They have a great beer selection and their 'House Special' pizza has to been one of my favorite pizza's I have ever had.   If you have a craving for a delicious pizza and good micro-brews, I highly recommend you try out Mellow Mushroom.   Warning: It is located on busy Mill Ave, so you have to feel comfortable around the college crowd.",

    "text": "I have been here twice and wish I could give them a better rating. \"Meh, I've experienced better\" is exactly how I feel about this place.  The beer selection is definatly impressive but I feel there is a lack of unique craft beers.   The first time I came to Mellow mushroom, our experience was awful.  Our waitress took her dear sweet time to do anything.  It literally took us over ten minutes to even place our drink order, and then she brought my friend out the wrong drink.  We bailed after one round and chalked it up to them having just opened.  The second experience here was actually much better.  Our server was prompt, knowledgable, friendly and very attentive; I was very relieved to see the service had improved.  My boyfriend and I ordered the all meat pizza and a salad as a starter.  The food was in no way bad, but it just felt like it lacked the wow factor.    Overall I would say I leave Mellow Mushroom feeling like I never really want to come back.....its just \"meh\".",

Service is amateur, but nice, very slow.  Pizza, well it can't be beat, but the toppings were very light.  This place has bad management written all over it.  It's a shame.  Next time I will call in a pick up. However the kitchens manager came out after the bill was dropped and apologized.  At least someone there is customer oriented.  He was able to turn it around.  Someone should promote him to GM",

One side was the Mellowterranean and the other was Magical Mystery Tour. Mellowterranean earns an A- while the Magical Mystery gets a solid B.

Our waiter was fairly attentive, all of the staff was walking around with a purpose. The exterior was funny though there was an intense odor of some sort of sewer problem just right outside the door. Inside the restaurant was typical skater boy/psychedelic decor. Meh. Seen it.   Onto the pizza. When it came out we were excited and starving; ready to dig in. The first bite was horrible. The crust was too thin, and there was more cheese on that pizza than any other pizza I've ever eaten. The toppings of the pizza were saturated in grease, I couldn't dab off enough. As we kept eating it got no better. I ate one slice. We had a large pizza. My husband ate one slice. When the waiter asked if we wanted to take it home we both said no way.   Now the pizza was bad, but the price was worse. We spent $25 on two drinks, and a pizza of horrible quality. We will not be coming back.",

They had awesome pizza combinations, so I wanted to try something out of the ordinary - the Magical Mystery Tour, with mushrooms, feta, pesto, spinach and jalapenos and added sausage. It was good, but I wasn't blown away like I wanted to be (but I am looking forward to my leftovers)! The doughy crust has a swipe of garlic and a little extra cheese, but I think I prefer something thinner and a little burnt from a wood fire oven. I sampled my boyfriend's gluten-free crust and it was good for what it was, but he was missing out at least a little!   I was impressed by the big draft beer list including rotating seasonal taps. I would go back again for beer and maybe to try some apps.",

    "text": "I don't know what is going on at this restaurant but it's not good. We bought a groupon because we've eaten at the location in Denver and loved it and know its a bit on the pricey side. The second we walked in by the hostess stand, it smelled terrible, almost a sewage issue smell, and no it did not smell bad outside. We sat on the patio but then the people next to us started smoking so we moved inside. Sewage smell would waft around every once in a while. We started off with the spinach salad which was pretty good. We opted for Half house special and half funky Q BBQ on our pizza. Both sounded awesome so we were excited to get it. Meh, definitely not great. One of my pet peeves is when pizza dough can't handle the toppings, the second you pick it up, all of the toppings slid off. I had to eat it with a fork and knife. It was super greasy and just Meh all around.   The service was fine, everyone seemed pretty indifferent and bored being there. The general environment just felt like a dirty college restaurant, which I guess makes sense since it's on Mill. I was just hoping since it's a chain, that it would still be decently maintained. When we left we saw our waiter hanging out in the t-shirt shop area of the restaurant on his cell phone and unprofessional things being said between waiters while we were eating. It was just an overall strange experience. Definitely won't go here ever again and don't recommend it.",

Everything was great, our server was great. But we all placed our food orders at the same time, except my food came our 20 minutes after my roommates. By the time my food came out they were already done eating and drinking their beers. A couple who sat across from us came in a half an hour after us and they finished eating before my sandwich even came out. The kitchen staff was fooling around with the pizza dough and surprisingly the restaurant was dead. I was very angry that I had to wait for my food, and very angry that our server didn't seem to care about my food or checked in with our table at all. Very unfortunate because this location is convenient for me, but this is the second bad experience I've had there so I will not be coming back.",

    "text": "Finally, somewhere I can score vegan pizza in the heart of downtown Tempe. Magic Mushroom is Mill Avenue's newest pizza joint and from what I can tell, it's off to a good start.  The restaurant itself is pretty massive. Tables, booths, bar, patio seating...all your bases covered. There are only TVs at the bar, and it was full so if you want to watch a game or something get here early.  Now let's talk beer. Mellow Mushroom boasts quite a selection of beers. I believe our server said something like 46 draft beers and what appeared to be just as many bottled/canned beers. When we arrived it was happy hour so I was able to grab a 20 oz. draft for $3.50. Regular price is $7 (for craft beers) and $6 for 16oz. A lot of the beers offered are local, so if you're one of those weirdos who like to support local businesses and what not, you're in luck.  We started our meal off with hummus. The dish was beautifully garnished with fresh parsley, paprika and toasty pita. As far as hummus goes, it was in the \"meh\" zone. It's pretty hard to eff up hummus unless you add bacon or some other god awful ingredient to it. I'd definitely love to see some buffalo tempeh or tofu on the appetizer menu, but I hope for too much.  The menu offers salads, hoagies, calzones and pizza (shocking, right?). They have all kinds of specialty pizzas with exciting ingredients. You can also build your own. You can pick your base, cheese, \"proteins\", fruit, veg...whatever. Some toppings that should be noted are sun-dried tomatoes, avocado, tempeh and jerk and BBQ tofu.  We decided to go with the large veggie pizza (I think it was called Mega Veggie), veganized by subbing the mozzarella for vegan cheese and omitting the garlic butter & parmesan from the crust as well as the feta.   I should mention that Jessica, our server, was awesome. Super friendly and helpful and she knew exactly what veganism was and was careful to make sure that the kitchen left the butter and cheese of our pizza.  The pizza was massive and packed with fresh, colorful toppings like tomato, artichoke hearts, broccoli, olives and tofu. If you get this pizza, you'll probably have to go all snooty-foodie and eat the first half of your slice with a knife and fork. It was very filling as well. My only complaint would be that I felt it needed more sauce, but I always prefer extra saucy pizzas.  Overall, my first experience at Mellow Mushroom was a positive one. As long as they keep the friendly staff, quality pizzas and tasty draft beers I'll keep coming.",

We waited for drink refills, actually her trainee noticed before she did. This continued through our meal. It seemed her trainee was more concerned about us than the trainer. In my opinion she wasn't worthy of training anyone. The food was good but service not so much. I don't think we'll go out of our way to go to this location again.",

Very very very skimpy on the VG vegan cheese let me say it again very very very skimpy on the vegan cheese and there's an up charge it figured if there's an up charge you get a little bit accredit from the real cheese that they don't use.  Way too much crust - you have to mellow that out a bit. People are just going to stop coming. I still like mellow mushroom and will return, maybe this was just a bad day.

We got one drink and then sat there without service again until at least 15 minutes after our drinks were finished. Not that the bartender was busy, she had friends at the end of the bar she was sitting there talking to the whole time. We were her only other customers. When I asked if there was any kind of flavor or pesto or anything she could give me for my awful bland, sauce-less sandwich, she said all they had was mayo. It did not help. This is the 3rd time we've dealt with this service and horrible food. I used to love them in Denver so I kept going back, but now we are done. Decent drink prices, and pizza, with awful service. So 2 stars. Maybe they should hire based on qualifications and not cool factor.",

And well...because it's dough, it will fill you up fast. The touch of molasses they add is what really makes this the best bit of heaven. I don't know how else to describe it since I find myself having to wipe the drool off my chin each time I try to think of a way to say it here.  My friends and I started out with their garlic and parmesan pretzels. They make these with the same dough they use to make the pizzas. Not too garlicky and just the right amount of parmesan. Mmmmmmm.  I got the Philosopher's Pie which has mushrooms, sliced steak, kalamata olives, artichoke hearts, and a garlic/olive oil base (rather than red sauce). Sweet sassy molassy! I've always liked my pizza pretty plain (think Marghuerita) and have to have sauce on my pizza (since it's usually dry without it). But this, THIS, was perfect! I was afraid it would be overpowering with the garlic base, but nope.   And it made for the best leftovers, heated up in the oven not the microwave, for 2 days after bringing it home.    Our servers were super friendly and fun as well. Thanks! It's probably better that I don't live closer to MM, because I'd be a rolling ball of dough if I did.",

They were still pretty good in this west coast location, but the extra purchase of the beer cheese for dipping was clearly the key.

    "text": "As promised, here's my \"make-up visit\" update.  Things improved dramatically since the last time I went. Firstly, our server wasn't an upsell machine. In fact, she was very polite and concerned about our order (Mine was particularly attentive with replacing and putting on the side of some ingredients, and she and the staff double-checked with me before and afterward to make sure everything was hunky-dory). The food was great, as always; had my first MM calzone, and I actually liked it better than the delicious pizza they have.   No mention of this in my first reviews, as I don't recall going to the bathroom, but their bathroom is great! Ha, maybe TMI for a food review; however, really impressed with the privacy of the stalls.  Back to more relevant things, I was confused (though I suppose not off-put) about the happy hour rules (we went after 10, which is advertised as HH); apparently it isn't half-price appetizers on some nights and instead is a slice of pepperoni or something for $3? Not sure I call that a deal, but I guess beers being half-off makes up for it.  I was kind of disappointed they didn't have Fall Woodchuck as I went during their fall-themed beers time, but I guess it's kinda a pussy beer anyway (I'll qualify myself by saying I'm more of a straight liquor guy, but Woodchuck is my guilty pleasure). The waitress had a nifty hand-written updated list she kept with her, and while I'm not a beer man I can appreciate the effort in something like that.  Anyway, like I said, they seem to have really improved here and I definitely recommend them; for the food if not the service. BON APPETIT!",

We asked to sit outside and there was another small group of people there as well. A few minutes after we were seated the server just barely ordered their drinks, she never greeted us to say she would be a moment, nothing. So I waited.. when she brought their drinks she never looked at our table (we were right next to them, what are we, ghosts?!) and she walked back inside. That ticked me off, so that's when I got my phone out and put the timer on, I told my husband she has five minutes to greet us, something, or we are walking. I got up, looked at her from the window and made direct eye contact and she looked away. She came out, I got excited, she is finally coming over.. nope, goes back to the group right next to us so they can order and she walked right back inside. I was pissed, I told my husband that we should just go, I grabbed our stuff and that is when another group was seated outside... Good luck to them, hopefully they got to eat. We ended up eating at Steak and Shake across the street.. I'd highly recommend going there.",

    "text": "After hearing my friends rave about this place, I finally decided to find out what all the fuss was about.  I don't frequent Tempe much these days, so I wasn't exactly sure where this was located; turns out it's in the old Z Gallery building.  A lot has changed in Tempe since I last worked there, including the parking situation, which was never great to begin with, and now it's even worse.  If you hit it on a Sunday, you can avoid paying the meter. Some things are still the same.  Some sketchy looking dude was hanging outside the building asking customers for food or money as they left, and we were followed back out to my car by a not so subtle homeless/crackhead/crazy person, who I was fully prepared to mace.     The place was relatively empty, but considering how large it is inside, I'm willing to bet that during ASU's semesters that place is hopping.  Our server wasn't overly enthusiastic, but overall she did a decent job.  She did seem annoyed with me while I was attempting to get my niece to order what we had agreed on.  That kid has zero understanding of money/budgeting, and I've really been trying to teach her, so I could've done without that look of judgment from the server.    My niece got a medium pizza with red sauce and a pesto swirl, artichoke hearts and salami.  I got a gluten free Gourmet White.  When they came out, I was impressed by the size of the medium pizza.  I would probably call that a large.  Gluten free only comes in one size.  Although it could've used more garlic, my pizza was good.  It's probably the best gluten free crust I've had thus far.  My niece's pizza looked and smelled amazing.  I tasted the pesto, and it rocked.    I was a little surprised by the prices, especially since my consistently broke friends frequent this place so much.  They won't pay more than $35 for a hotel room in Vegas, but will pay $25 for a pizza?  Yeah, I'll probably never get that, but I digress.",

    "text": "For what could have been a great place, Mellow Mushroom does not deliver. On paper, this place sounds great--many different types of beer, unique pizza, good location, everything you need to be a thriving business on Mill. Even with all that, this place falls very short in my book.  More than once, my pizza has come out too gooey (I'm talking uncooked gooey). Service isn't anything special... some of the employees are actually a bit rude and arrogant and this really detracts from the experience. At first I thought it was just me, but I confirmed it by reading some of the other reviews here--they don't pour beer correctly and it takes away from the taste of the beer too early after pouring or you end up with 3/4 of what should be a full pint. This makes me not care how wide their selection is--you're ruining drinks and that totally sucks.  Also, the restaurant is too segmented. It almost feels like 4 dining rooms: one area straight ahead when you walk in, one area straight ahead when you walk in and to the right a bit, the patio area (including the section just left of when you first walk in), and then the bar area. This design doesn't work well on Mill Avenue and makes your place look empty even when there are several groups inside. On Mill, you want to seem like a popular spot but with everyone couped up in the bar area, the curb appeal of Mellow isn't very high.  Won't be back soon.",

A table next to us went to the bar to get their own beers....again Kevin was their server.  When I said the pizza better be be good I've waited forever.....Kevin only said let's hope so. Update: He also failed to give us hh pricing on the ONE beer we ordered....we couldn't order more he didn't check back on us until we finally finished eating. This was an experience to remember. FYI the pizza wasn't that great I'd rather have Vito's in Mesa than this hot mess. I'd never recommend this place to anyone.",

    "text": "Review is not based off the food. Service here is absolutely terrible called to place an order for a pizza and salad before 12pm and told me it would be 20 minutes. Showed up and was told the person who took my order never placed it. So I was asked if I wanted to wait and at this point I'm already here so why not. Order was placed and all I got was a sorry when she handed me the bill with no real look in the eye no offer to try and make it better from there. Have had terrible service when I've been in the restaurant before but thought I would give it another chance not after this. I work in the customer service industry and usually when the company makes a mistake they try to do what they can in their power to make it better. I could have gotten more than a poor sorry. Also when I finally did get my pizza no one said anything they just put the order next to me and walked away... Wow lol could not be worse",

When we got there we were seated quickly and got asked by two different people if we wanted drinks. After getting our drinks, we ordered our food and  that's where the good feelings quickly changed.  While the pizza itself was good, the service was by far the worst I have ever experienced. Our waitress didn't return for over 45 minutes between when she placed our order and brought the check. Not once did she check on us to make sure everything was good or to see if we needed anything. I had to ask one of the busboys for a refill on my drink because the waitress never bothered to come by (or to the other two tables by us).  I had high hopes for my big out, but after this experience I won't be back. Perhaps just takeout if I'm in the mood for the pizza.",

Not wearing \"booty shorts\" dining room was large and open.  Semi seperated from the bar area with t.v.s etc. Server was Kyle, laid back guy, he was friendly and proficient. The menu was varied. Offered items for alternative diets ( tofu hoagie , gluten free pizzas etc) we got the \"holy shitake\" pizza, and it was VERY good. Garlic sauce, mushrooms onions shaved parmesan, herb crust. Im not a big fan of red sauce, so i prefer pizza joints that offer other bases, this place has a few, i saw red sauce, garlic, and pesto, and i didnt read the whole menu so there could be more.  Prices seemed on point with this neighborhood.  Bathrooms were modern, and clean, offering hand dryers, and paper towel dispensers that forked over regular sizes sheets of paper towels. The whole building looked clean, and new. Overall impression: nice, clean pizza place, with bar, offering something for everyone, at the standard price.",

It was pretty busy but we were able to grab a table on the patio to people watch while waiting for our Mighty Meaty pizza.  It was amazing. I've always said that, when you have bacon on a pizza, crumbles just won't do. We had honest to goodness chucks o' bacon as well as sausage, pepperoni, ground beef and ham. I was in heaven and wished I had a bigger stomach.  The crust was interesting, too. I loved it.  When we were stuffed, we decided to take a little dessert back to the hotel with us - honey cinnamon pretzels. They are probably much better if you eat them right out of the oven but even after a quick trip in the hotel micro, they weren't too bad!  Since we aren't drinkers, I can't comment on the bar/drinks situation but the set up was quite impressive with a ton of taps.  They'd be a cool addition to Tucson - maybe in Main Gate Square or close by.   Great service Great food  We'll be back!",

You kind of have to eat mushrooms at a place called the mellow mushroom. I've also had the Fun Guy pie (5 types of mushrooms if I remember correctly) which I believe is exclusive to their northern Phoenix location. Their wings are average, nothing special. But the pizza is awesome. Also, if you're looking for a good appetizer, try their pretzels!",

I was a little surprised at how expensive it was but we still decided to go pick it up. The staff was nice and the pizza was ready right when we got there.   The pizza was AMAZING! usually its the toppings that stand out, well not only were the toppings delicious but the crust was incredible! SO DAMN GOOD! I wolfed down 3 slices with the quickness. overall great pizza and I look forward to eating the leftovers.   Overall great pizza and experience, only con was how expensive it was. Check it out!",

I had the grasshopper cider - it had a very unique taste to it, and was pretty strong. I liked it a lot.   By the way, if you go during happy hour, it's half off of the drinks.  The restaurant was clean and had a relaxed atmosphere. Great staff, great drinks, and great atmosphere - highly recommended.",

The drink prices are wonderful and the beer selection is great. The only slightly negative thing I have about the bar is that the cocktails are inconsistent. Sometimes they are weak and sometimes they taste great which is to expect with the different bartenders. I love the ambiance of the bar and the bartenders are fast and attentive which is wonderful. I recommend this bar to any one who wants cheap good drinks on mill avenue and will continue to do so unless there is any drastic changes. Great job mellow mushroom. Keep up the good work and please never become a dance club like all the other bars on mill!

This was my second time ordering from this location but I've been enjoying Mellow Mushroom for quite a few years from when I lived in GA and NC! Due to food allergies, I have them customize a calzone for me. Tonight it didn't even resemble a calzone and I haven't eaten it yet so we'll see how it is later, but look wise, it barely had any pepperoni in it and was a flat rectangle shape instead of the puffy, yummy looking calzone they normally serve. The first time I went I had ordered a few different calzones and everything was PERFECT though! Hoping that tonight was just a fluke and that the \"calzone\" tastes better than it looks. I live about 45min away so I didn't feel like waiting around to have it remade. I am a little surprised that both times I've been there, there's only been a handful of people in the restaurant.   *Side note, I went to the bar to get my take out (like I did the first time) but I guess there is a special entrance for take-out's. There were 3 employees at the host stand when I got there and none said a word to me when walking in. So I got a nice little tour of the restaurant trying to find out where to go.",

I didn't get a chance to go then, so when I saw that they had arrived in Tempe, and the Groupon came out, I was excited to give it a try.  On the recommendation of some friends who have eaten there, we organized an outing. I was really excited by the menu; lost of interesting sounding vegetarian options. The beer selection is impressive (try the orange blossom-yum!).  The stuffed portabello appetizer was disappointing. The pizzas were okay; I liked the Magical Mystery Tour better than the Gourmet White for sure, but neither was super amazing.  The service was okay; there were a few mishaps, people being given the wrong beer, check splitting was a little too complicated even with advance notice, but nothing awful.  The atmosphere is decent; I imagine the original one was super fun and quirky, but replicating that in a chain almost never works.  I will probably go back to try some of the things that sounded good that I didn't get to try last time; but it is a bit pricey, probably overpriced for the quality.",

He should have asked if we wanted a beer list- despite my small stature and female body, I usually enjoy a beer when I go out to dinner. He was trying really hard though. Meh.  I thought the crust was pretty good, but it was awkwardly sitting on top of a pre-made, thin dough circle that held all the toppings. So although the crust was good, the pizza was hardly structurally sound, flopping around in my hand like a fish. I was happy they offered vegan options, but the tofu didn't have any type of seasoning on it, and the pizza was pretty bland. Meh.  The theme is cute, but it sort of comes off with a fake-TGIF kind of vibe. This definitely seems like a place where stupid corporate policies (maybe, for instance, to refer to customers as \"dear ladies\") are really important to management. Meh.  A far as telling my friends to go here... well, I mean it's a new place on mill that doesn't totally suck. And it's one of the few vegan places around. It's also mediocre and a little overpriced. I guess you should go  if you are around there anyways. I think one word really sums this place up; Meh.  Hence the two stars.",

Waitress came to us and informed that the cook had mistakenly make a chicken calzone instead of beef one. She asked if it was okay. We asked for the beef. Because of this mistake and not being asked if we want the food served together, we had our pizza served before the calzone, so the person who supposed to have a calzone had to wait while I was eating. It was quite inconvenient.  The pizza was tasteless. The dough was worse than in Ahwatukee location. Fun Guy part was lacking the mushroom quantity, having big plain cheese areas. Overall, it was the worst pizza I have ever had in Mellow Mushroom.      Waitress didn't try make even one smile toward us, that how great the service was. Awful experience, considering the gift card that covered the most of the bill. It is nice that the owner gives you a gift card as a formal apology, but it isn't worth going back when the pizza is not so good and the service is so terrible.  I got the feel that Mellow Mushroom came to conclusion that selling beer is more profitable than making tasty pizzas.",

    "text": "Hit up the much-anticipated (at least by me) Mellow Mushroom last night and was not disappointed.  Highlights: 1. Tasty Pizza - plenty of veg options and crispy, seasoned crust. 2. Fantastic beer selection - includes local faves and my absolute favorite (Rogue Hazelnut Brown Ale) on tap. 3. Large space - no waiting for a table, and I don't HAVE to smash toe to toe with the bros.  Unfortunate aspects: 1. Most 16 oz beers on tap are $6 (six!!!?) and it's a buck more for 20 oz. That's pretty steep in my book, even for Mill Ave. Thank the Good Dude that Happy Hour starts at 10pm and we got our half price :) 2. Portions seemed OK, but I was a little surprised by the price point. Probably a bit too expensive for me to be a regular... the three of us had a hummus, 6 beers (@ $3.50 happy hour prices), and a Med (14\") Pizza and the tab came out at almost $50. That's a little more than I like to spend on a weeknight for pizza and beer. And if it was not happy hour I would certainly not be happy paying $7 for a beer.  All in all, I really dug the atmosphere, pizza, and beer selection. I would like to see a bit more \"character,\" but it did open two days ago and it has to appeal to tourists. I think it has a lot of potential to succeed in my humble college town. And the late-night hours guarantee that I will make a few drunken stops for pizza, despite any complaints about the price.",

Took 20-25 minutes to make, in a nearly empty restaurant.  Was bread, a bunch of cheese, and a very small amount of chicken, olives and red pepper- Get a gyro twice as tasty, twice as healthy and half the price down the street instead.  Not worth the $13.  Bartender was weird- I think he thought I was homeless, or something.  I won't say I won't be back.. A stripper with a Ph.D. could beg to go on a date there and I would probably give it a second chance.  I'd make her pay, though.",

Didn't get the bartender to apologize and instead called in the bouncer and threatened to call the cops in on the entire party for imaginary reasons. Clearly they were all having a bad day after dealing with an army of ASU students but that still is no excuse for such appalling behavior. Will never go back there again.

    "text": "I've lived in Tempe for a long time and I've seen lots or restaurants come and go. I feel like the south end of Mill Ave is finally emerging from the icy grip of the Great Recession. (Remember, that part of Mill pretty much died in 2007-2008.) I'm happy to see new things bringing activity north of 6th Street.   And it's a pizza/beer place with a psychedelic theme: graffiti art adorns the walls, the mascot is a mushroom, and all the names of desserts are double entendres. Tempe IS a college town and Mellow Mushroom will do just fine for these reasons. That and they say they will be open til 2 a.m.  The beer selection was extensive, although the beer I ordered off the menu wasn't available. No biggie. There were lots more to choose from.  I split a 10'' veggie pizza and it was loaded with veggies (and even tofu). I liked the dough, it's made with molasses so it has that darker flavor. The cinnamon sugar pretzels were great too. I took some home and they heated up just fine.   It's a big space and I didn't feel cramped. The windows let in a lot of light and the views are pretty nice. Service was attentive and all the workers seemed to be trained to bus tables even if they were not \"their\" tables. A couple different people cleared plates and filled up my water and asked if I wanted more beer.   They also have a little walk up section off 7th Street. And I liked the neon sign above the door. I don't eat a lot of pizza, but if I'm ever in the mood I'd go to Mellow Mushroom.",

They do offer options for all of these needs but they do cost more, alot more!!!  We ordered one vegan, gluten-free pizza and one gluten-free pizza with vegan cheese and meat (for a person who can't eat dairy). We got our food and half way through eating our vegan pizza we found what appeared to be sausage on it!! There were a few small pieces, but I'm vegan for several reasons and don't want ANY animal products on my food!!!  The other pizza came out with dairy cheese on it...so we had to ask the server to come check it out...he tried to convince us that it was garlic or something (anything other than meat) on our pizza which wasn't True at all! Finally the kitchen manager came out and looked at it and re-made both pizzas for us. A very nice gesture that was greatly appreciated. It was a bit frustrating because we had a 2 year old with us who was hungry and we had to tell him (after waiting a long time already) that he had to wait again to get more pizza without any meat on it. They were friendly about correcting the issue and the second round of pizzas were properly made. They also discounted our bill for the inconvenience which was also greatly appreciated.  We took the uneaten portion of of our food and boxed it up and donated it to one of the many hungry people who hang out on Mill Ave looking for donations. I suppose in the end it worked out well for everyone and that's awesome!  The place was extremely loud and we could hardly hear the waiter taking our order which was a bit annoying but it was a weekend night in a college area so that's to be somewhat expected...esp when they serve a lot of booze ;)",

    "text": "Don't let the Hard Rock Cafe-style t-shirt shop at the front entrance scare you away from a solid pizza and beer joint.  I had been to another Mellow Mushroom in Columbia, S.C., so I was expecting dark, cramped and a little grimy. You know, like a real college town. This one is bright, loud and wide open.  So the Tempe location couldn't shake the corporate vibe of the what-the-heck-is-this-doing-in-a-college-town Z Gallerie it replaced. And it's not gonna stop longtime Tempe townies from whining about the good ol' days of Long Wong's.  But Mellow Mushroom is a simple concept - pizza and beer. And they pretty well crush it.  First up is the beer list. They have more than 40 beers on tap, including smaller local players like SunUp and Lumberyard as well as rarities like Bell's Oberon. Most of them go for $6 a pint or $7 for a 20-ounce glass. Not the worst prices in town, but they're gonna need some drink specials to keep the ASU crowd hanging out.  The pizza lineup is equally impressive. My wife has a severe tomato intolerance, which takes a lot of the fun out of pizza night. I get awful tired of eating everybody's \"bianca\" or \"blanca\" - the ubiquitous specialty pizza that subs garlic sauce and puts a few dabs of ricotta on top. Props to Mellow Mushroom for offering a whopping seven specialty pizzas sans tomato sauce and two non-tomato sauce options for custom pies.  We got the Red Skin Potato Pie, which also had bacon, onion, chives and a ranch drizzle. I'd worry about a pizza like that being too starchy, but the thin-sliced potatoes worked in perfect harmony with the other toppings.  We also got the pretzels, which are giant knots of MM's pizza dough (these guys like to brag about the dough). Troy S. might have had different expectations, but we thoroughly enjoyed the soft, hot, doughy concoctions.  Our waitress seemed like she was having fun as she introduced herself as our guide to a \"magical mystery tour of flavor,\" and the restaurant's sprawling, open floorplan seemed like it would work well for large groups.  Bonus: They validate your parking for the Centerpointe garage, which will save you six bucks.  So here's a recap: Pizza + beer = awesome. Clever pizza + eclectic beers = even awesomer. Mellow Mushroom is solid execution on this brilliantly simple concept. I'm not going to buy a t-shirt or proclaim this place the savior of Mill Avenue, but this college-town staple is a welcome addition that's worth the trip to downtown Tempe.",

All of the food I have had here has been good for bar food. The real reason to come is their amazing selection of beers on tap, which seems to be a rarity in these parts. They also have an excellent happy hour from 3-6 when every drink and appetizer is half off. The service was a bit hit or miss depending on the server, but not bad at all. Good amount of outdoor seating but could probably do with being expanded if possible.",

I am from New York, however, and this pizza is nothing special and worth nowhere near that much. The bartender recommended a beer that was served to me in a rocks glass. When I inquired about that, she told me they only serve 9 oz glasses since it is an ale with a higher alcohol content. When my change for a 20 dollar bill was $12.30 I was shocked. I will not be coming back here; If I want a good beer selection there are a dozen other places in the area, and the same goes for pizza.",

But anyway, we had a gregarious, rollicking Epicurean evening of beer samplings and not-too-shabby food courses. Loved the bleu cheese crumbles w/  vinagrette salad and the sausage meatball...thing. I like the coffee porter, and the banana-y tasting lager. Ladies, thanks for the extras! Service was top notch - 5 stars for that alone.

I opened a tab for myself and the bartender put every ones drinks on my tab and ignored the problem and made us wait another 15 for them just to ask us who had what. At one point four employees were behind the bar and we had to wait that long (I checked the time). And to make matters worse my friend got a parking ticket because they took so long. No sorry from any of them and not even a drip of regret from the manager. He pretty much told us to chill out after this whole 45 min waiting game when all we were trying to do was pay our bills and leave.",

(If there were a seperate rating for service, it would be 3 stars.) The food is delicious!!! Definitely try the meatball appetizer and the spinach dip. The pizza's are great as well. I tried the jerk chicken wings and was not impressed with the seasonings, but the overall flavor was ok. Tried the pretzel dessert, which by the way, is literally a large pretzel the size you would buy at a mall or sports event. The dough seems to be made in house and the pretzels rolled by hand, which is really refreshing to see in a restaurant that serves many items made with bread.  Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you can go during happy hour.",

The crust though different was not that great either. Beverages are all totally overpiced. I'm a fan of hard ciders especially Hornsby's cider. One bottle here is only .50 cheaper than a 6 pack. My simple pizza was just shy of $18!!  The host at the door just let me walk in and take a seat. she seated everyone else. I set for 7 minutes until my waiter came and then he got me a menu.   There's a survey you can take on your reciept that gives you $5 off your next visit. I wish I could just have my evening back and my money. I brought half the pizza home which was my plan to tkae it for lunch tomorrow. Nope I will wreck my 30 min lunch break with this crap!

The waitresses that helped us were extremely nice and treated us very well, she even gave us a free slice of pizza! The pizza itself is definitely the best local thin crust pizza I've ever had. I'm not normally a fan of thin crust but give me a Mellow Mushroom thin crust over any thick crust any day of the week. The only gripe I have with the pizza is the price, It was about $3.00 for one slice but whole pizzas are cheaper should you be hungrier than me.",

Sat down w/ 2 kids during lunchtime on a Tuesday.. put kids orders in rt away but noticed server was working several tables both inside and outside.. had to ask several times to place drink order and ordered a beer that came 25 minutes after it was ordered (kept time on phone)... Completely aggravated w/ service so told server to pack everything to go, salads and all as kids had still not gotten food. Waited an additional 20 minutes for pizza up front and finally asked to speak with manager. Manager told me he was in kitchen helping as they were \"overwhelmed\" w/ above normal lunch crown for a Tuesday.. first question I asked him was how long does it normally take to get pizza on table when ordered.. said 20 minutes! I waited 53 minutes for single pizza and manager stood there w/ dumb look on his face b/c he knew I was right. Told him I was not looking for anything free or taken off bill as bill was already paid and I tipped server 20% as this was not his fault.. business completely understaffed for a lunchtime crowd! Avoid this place at all cost and look at the other reviews.. seems to be common consensus that service is bad, place is dirty and overall just another overrated restaurant along Mill avenue run and serviced by \"at their own pace\" hipsters",

During Tempe Arts Fest they had a table set up selling off slices. My son and I both agreed it was the best pizza we'd ever had. The crust is magnificent. I can only describe it as having a genuine wheat taste to it, simular to a sun-dried tomato bagel. The sauce and cheeze were perfect. I loved the decor inside and all the artistic shirts that were for sale. The folks I spoke to were great and told us about the history of the company. I would love to come back for a full dinner experience. However, based on some reviews, it does indeed appear that there maybe a few employees they need to weed out first. Mello Mushroom are new here, so perhaps they just have to work out a few kinks. I would hate to see an establishment like this fail because of poor customer service. So far, I like what I see, but am withholding my 5 star review till later.",

While I understand that each location is different, I had similar expectations for this Tempe location. Stopped here on a Saturday for lunch, it was not crowded, we were seated immediately, and the waitress and servers were nice & attentive during our meal. The artichoke dip was delicious. The kids meal was nicely portioned. But one of our pizzas arrived soggy and with the wrong topping (tofu--bleh--instead of chicken). We mentioned to the waitress right away and she seemed to question us that we made a mistake. We were pretty insistent that we wanted chicken and shortly after, a manager stopped by to hand deliver our requested chicken.  Overall this place was great, based on friendly service and their willingness to accommodate our original order. We requested dairy free cheese on the pizza above, so it was understandable why they might ASSuME we wanted a vegan pie...except the waitress clarified if we wanted chicken initially, and we were adamant that we knew what we were doing. However, I can never forgive a soggy pizza, that's like a cardinal sin and I need to pray.",

My date and I shared a medium cheese pizza with an order of Thai chili wings.   I asked for garlic to put on pizza in which our server gave us garlic aioli. Dipped our pizza in that and it was bangin. Pizza was delicious on its own but the garlic aioli put it one step above.   Loved this place, great food, great service. Definitely coming back, may try something new, but thoroughly enjoyed our simple yet very tasty meal.",

The Mill location is cool because it is so close to ASU's campus and the vibe is \"mellow.\"   Happy hour deals are appealing but there are so many other choices on Mill Ave that are locally owned bars.   The only time this place has a crowd is on game nights for ASU football or if another big athletic event is happening in which case every other bar is packed too.   I am not bad-mouthing this restaurant, just pointing out my observations. It is still a great place to go to get your favorite type of pizza at a sit-down restaurant. They also have a lot of cool artwork and murals on the inside. Try counting how many skateboards are incorporated into art pieces and other decor!",

The manager was more than apologetic and recovered well but we will not be ordering from them again.

    "text": "The Short Story: The management is unfriendly and unapologetic if their staff makes mistakes.  Jenna, the lead bartender, trains the bartenders to intentionally pour the draft beer with extra head so as to give customers less beer (I've heard this is because of a bonus system the place uses for management).  Her personality is abrasive and in general she is not pleasant to be around.  If you see she is the bartender (she is a tall woman with shortish hair and tattoos), I would suggest getting a table instead of sitting at the bar.  I used to be somewhat of a regular here, but the attitude of the staff (management and bartenders especially) is so rude and unwelcoming that I have no desire to ever go back again.  There are plenty of other businesses in the immediate area that will actually appreciate my (and your) business.  If you want pizza on Mill Ave, you're better off hitting up La Bocca (across the street) or try Slices (on 6th street). You could also go around the corner to Oregano's on University Dr.",

The good was the pizza and the kitchen manager, David. He came to the rescue and took excellent care of us. He turned what would have been a pretty negative experience into a good one. He made up for everything the staff lacked and whipped up a great pizza! I'll be coming back for sure!",

I was extremely excited for this because I love cheesy bread...and it looked so good when it arrived at our table...but ugh it was so average and unappetizing. The pizza arrived fairly quickly but that didn't benefit me at all because it was not good at all. The cheese was so thick that it could choke a horse. But anyways, I give this place 1 star because we had a nice server and they had good lemonade.",

    "text": "A group of us went to the Mellow Mushroom for pizza and beer after work. The restaurant was only about 30% full since it was so early. Not everyone decided to order a glass of beer, but those of us that did had to wait 20 to 25 minutes to be served. The waitress said the bar was very backed up. But when I looked over, I saw them talking beyond the bar and they did not look busy. It was very bizarre. 20 minutes for a beer in a less than half full restaurant? The waitress kept saying that they \"the bar\" were killing her and she apologized profusely. It was really odd. The pizza was good, but ate before beer arrived and then had to drink the beer quickly before leaving.",

It was just dry pizza dough in the shape of a pretzel. My biggest reason for writing this review was the fact that we ordered 3 kids meals. They came out in scorching hot plates. Seriously this place is lucky that I'm the one that picked up the dish and not one of the small kids. I burnt the shit out of my fingers. We let the waitress know they were that hot and that we aren't warned about it when they were brought to us and she seemed to not really care. No manager came by to apologize or anything. Really bad......we definitely won't be back. And if you get food for your kids, be careful that they don't get burned. I have a huge blister on my finger from touching the dish. Parents beware!!",

My husband and I went on a Friday night at about 5:30 pm and it was pretty empty, but filled up quickly while we were there.  After a hostess seated us, it took a good 5-10 min for our server to come over. Not a very reassuring start to dinner at a new place! We soon found out that they were having a great drink special off 1/2 all local beers. And they have an amazing local beer selection... Four Peaks, Papago, Grand Canyon, San Tan, and a few more.   We ordered a small Caesar salad and medium Hawaiian pizza to share. Service was sloooow. The salad was good, but the portion very small. The pizza was amazing, especially the crust! We weren't sure if the medium would be enough... but it was 6 big slices!  Besides the slow service, the prices were steep. The beers were $3.50 each at the special price (usually 7), small salad $5, and pizza $18. Before the Groupon, our bill was $33... a little much for a pizza place. Even with the Groupon, I still didn't feel like I got a great deal. Instead, it made it just bearable.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings on this place. Things I like have matching downsides.   Pro: The pizza is very good and they offer a lot of off-the-beaten-path pies so you can try something you've never had before. They certainly have their own style so don't expect a copy of NY or Chicago-style pizzas. Con: You better bring some loot; this is some pricey pizza.  Pro: At happy hour, you have 1/2 off of (basically all) drinks with a very good draft selection. Con: Only appetizers are on special (and they aren't too good). Pizza is not on special. Beer off of happy hour is also pretty pricey.  Pro: he service is friendly and quick (especially if you sit in the bar) and the place is clean, open, and bright. Con: Groups larger than 6 might have trouble getting a table.  Nonetheless, I do end up here once in a while and I leave happy.  EDIT: within a few hours of posting my review, the owner Jay B., sent me a message to address the \"cons\" on my review, justifying higher prices with the use of premium ingredients. It was a nice to see the personal interest he takes in his business, even though he called me \"Mark.\"",

But it could have used a little more mushrooms considering the price I paid.  I was reluctant to go back since the last time I went I paid over $15 for a build-your-own salad, which came with wilted greens and were stingy with all of the ingredients that you had to add. I was hard pressed to find the mushrooms, avocado (not even a full slice) and olives that I added, basically all the extras besides the wilted greens.    If you're eating there and ordering pizza be prepared to wait, it's not ideal for a quick lunch. And be prepared to shell out a few dollars.  The food is not cheap! The likelihood of returning to Mellow Mushroom for lunch would be minimal at this point, but I do hear they have good Happy Hour deals.  Maybe I'll see you then.",

    "text": "I'm vegan, and I've been to this mellow mushroom multiple times. Always mostly impressed. The pizza is overpriced sometimes slow, but I've known to expect this. Tonight was different. We came in with a group of 8, all mostly vegan, which shouldn't be a problem because the restaurant advertises as being vegan friendly.  Well, as we went to order, the server informs us that the red sauce has meat in it. Immediately myself and all my friends were floored...we've all eaten the red sauce before. The \"chef\" (not sure who this was) came over to explain that the red sauce didn't have meat in it...whew.  First mistake - they screwed up my friends order. They orders a large pizza with just artichokes and vegan cheese. It came out as the mega veggie. When asked the server he was adamant that this would be taken care of on the bill (there's about an 8$ difference here).   Secondly, I found bacon on my VEGAN pizza. The manager/chef came over and was apologetic. However, he offered to take off half the pizza, because we ate the other half. Really, if I knew it had bacon on it, I wouldn't eat ANY of it. I had to fight to get the entire pizza taken off...  Third, we sat down at 8:45 and didn't leave until after 10pm. This was mainly because the pizza took over an hour. That's unacceptable.   Finally, when my friends questioned about the bill - yes, they were charged the extra $8 for the mega veggie, even though they didn't order it, they were given gift cards. Not cool.   Finally, I want to stress that the mellow mushroom in tempe is NOT VEGAN FRIENDLY. The waitstaff and mangers don't understand vegans (they kept saying we could order anything off the gluten-free menu - no thanks the crust has egg). Also, they don't know what's vegan on the menu. You can't advertise as being vegan friendly if you don't know what's vegan - or even know what a vegan is.   Beyond the vegan thing, the service was okay but clearly taking on hour for pizza when it's slow is not cool. And the ways that they tried to take care of their mistakes really were not appropriate. I will not be going back to mellow mushroom Tempe, and I want to caution vegans on going back.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I had two experiences, so far, at the mellow mushroom.  The first was on St. Patrick's Day, shortly after the Flogging Molly concert at Tempe Beach Park let out...obviously this place would be busy.  We had to wait quite a bit to get the attention of the server, but the place was packed, so I can't hold this against them too much.   The bruscetta and pizza we got was amazing, one of the better pies I've ever tasted.  With an extensive beer selection and full bar, with relatively competent bartenders that seemed to be able to keep up with the demand for drinks and extended hours, this seemed like a great place for a late night snack and nightcap.  The following week, we return on a Wednesday, about 2 hours before closing time.  We sat at a booth in the bar area and were met by a server relatively quickly.  Our order was taken and drinks brought out, only to find out that they are only doing slices of pizza at the time, not making any new ones...We figured we'd try it out and get a couple of slices with some pretzles to even it all out.  After finishing our slices and waiting for an extra 10-15 minutes, we finally flagged down the waitress and asked about the pretzles, she mentioned that the kitchen wasn't cooking anything new.  We also asked one of the bartenders (who may or may not have been a manager), when they killed the menu for future reference, and was told about 10 or 10:30 they went to slices only of whatever they had available (in a rather rude tone for someone addressing two of maybe 8 customers in the whole place...).  After eliciting our disappointment, they offered to comp our drinks, which were the most expensive items we ordered, which made the visit managable but still very disappointing.  Bottom Line:  Go for lunch, when it won't be too busy, and you'll have a chance at being treated properly.  After about 10pm or so, just go to Slices.",

The tofu wasn't cooked very well...but I like the fact that that try.  The ambiance/atmosphere was non-existent - The restaurant has a cheap elegant layout (like Cheesecake Factory or Picazzos), but there is hip-hop/urban/skater artwork covering the walls and the menu has a hippie vibe. What? I am not sure what they are going for, but it isn't  working.  This place is pretty pricey for a pizza joint!  We ordered: 1 beer, 1 medium pizza, 1 root beer and the total was $32.  For that price, I could have some nice cocktails with my pizza at The Parlor.",

    "text": "Been here a few times with the work gang.  Previously, I hadn't been too impressed with their Za.  First time I ordered my standard pie: pepperoni and green peppers.  The crust was pretty good, thin-ish, crispy on the edges.  The sauce and ingredients were decent, but not stellar.  My buddies always get the \"Red Skin Potato Pie\" speciality, and that is indeed pretty tasty, but I can only eat 1 slice of something like that before I'm bored with it.  While their \"regular\" pizza are just ok, I suspected the specialty pizzas are the way to go.  So, today I tried the \"Melchacho\" which was chipotle sauce base with chorizo, red peppers, avocado and cilantro.  WOW!  Great flavors, perfectly spicy. I will absolutely come back for that pie.  It's not listed on the corporate menu online, but it's available at the Mill Ave (Tempe) location.  Did I say \"WOW!\"  Yeah, I think I did.  SERVICE: The wait staff is always great, but every time I've been it takes quite a long time for the pizzas to come out.    Not recommended if you're on a tight lunch schedule.",

    "text": "We loved coming to mill ave, last night.   The culture there is fantastic. There are a lot of little shops and bars. We were especially impressed with the mellow mushroom. Our server Angelica (who had extensive knowledge of the beer and food) made it very easy to order pizza and beer we were going to enjoy. She suggested a pizza called the mellow-chacho which I guess isn't normally on the menu, and also suggested a beer to drink with it that fit really well. Everything was done timely and with a smile.   Our server also ended up cutting off my friend from drinking alcohol, and although he told her he was not driving, she was right in doing so. She brought him a glass of water an joked with him that he had to drink the whole thing first. He had become pretty boisterous, and a little out of hand. I would have done the same thing.   We also had a fantastic desert. Some kind of cookie Sunday, but there was waaaayy to much whipping cream.   Last they serve a pear martini, that is not entirely consistent. The first time I ordered it, it tasted great, the second was way too sweet. I asked her to find out which bar tender made the first one, and his name is Joe, so ask for Joe to make your drinks.   The patio could use a bit of expanding if possible, there was not enough room for me to smoke a cigarette without being super close to people who were eating.   Over-all I loved it. I'm not quite sure why people don't love this place. Maybe the service varies between shifts, but the service I was given was great. So ask for angelica, and have Joe make your drinks. Also the manager who is a little older, and has a black hat and chef coat is super nice and really funny.",

    "text": "I always hate when you go to a place that's been hyped up just to end up generally disappointed. The pizza wasn't bad---it just wasn't anything too special like I expected. They have a lot of options for toppings which is cool, as well as some interesting appetizers. I did like their crust, it was crispy on the outside but nice and fluffy on the inside. Really, it just reminded me of pizza I've had a million times though...better than your huge chains like Pizza Hut and Papa John's and probably on the same level as places like NYPD and Streets of New York. So, it wasn't bad. I will tell you that the pizza warms up horribly though in the microwave! A large (16 inch) pizza is about 25 friggin' bucks so I want to eat all of it, leftovers included, but the crust cooks too much and becomes hard while your toppings are still cold. So, you either enjoy the crust and not the rest of the slice OR enjoy the majority of the pizza and not the crust which you actually enjoyed. Service isn't that great, I feel like this is a trend on Mill. They do seem to have a lot of options as per beers and whatnot, I'd expect they'd be a cool place to go for happy hour.   So, overall I won't be trying them again. If I wanna pay a lot of money for a pizza I'll go a block over to Oregano's where the pizza is cheaper, bigger, and more enjoyable in my opinion. I really was hoping for more from this place.",

    "text": "By offering a Build-Your-Own Salad I assumed Mellow Mushroom would be able to merely place the ingredients I requested into a plastic container and send me on my way.  This is apparently too much to ask.  After having our BYO Salad orders taken we were told that the \"Take Out Girl\" would be by to ring us up.  Who is Take Out Girl?  Is she a new Marvel comics character who flings doggie bags at ne'er-do-wells?  I hope she wears a cape!  No one, neither Super Hero nor mere mortal, comes by.  It doesn't look like anyone is even assembling anything resembling a salad (we can see straight into the kitchen from the order counter).  A good 7 minutes (it is 12:15pm on a Monday...perhaps ensuring the designated Take Out Counter is manned by the aforementioned Take Out Girl is again too much to ask...maybe she is fighting crime somewhere?)  We ask one of the guys making pizza if he knows the status of our salad and another guy yells from the back that he just started making it.  Take Out Girl appears (no cape), rings us up, then leaves again (she must be a very busy avenging Take Out orders).  More time passes and she returns with two plastic containers.  From the other side of the counter I can see there is a man hand-sized heap of artichoke hearts smothering my salad.  No other toppings besides greenery are visible.  Take Out Girl bags our salads and as we head out the door, an angry voice from the back of the kitchen yells something in audible so we turn to look.  He is clearly peeved as he hollers at Take Out Girl, \"Are you gonna let me give them their chicken?!?\"  \"Oh...yeah...\" says Take Out Girl as she goes to the back and returns with two smaller containers of something hot wrapped in aluminum foil fogging up the plastic.  I think Take Out Girl needs to find a new super power.  I decide to survey the situation in the office kitchen as I have a sinking feeling an autopsy of the salad I had hoped for is about to ensue and I need a tile floor.  After I excavate the half-pound of artichoke heart, I see all the shaved parmesan has been assimilated Borg-style into the artichoke heap.  Instead of the sun-dried tomatoes I ordered, a few unripe grape tomatoes line the perimeter.  There are three pieces of green pepper.  I then opened the container of chicken, unwrapped the aluminum foil and behold chicken breast that has never, ever been anywhere near a grill.  This is pre-baked, sliced and MICROWAVED.  I double-checked and the menu clearly states \"grilled.\"  Too hungry and too pressed for time to bundle back up this mess and walk back to the Mellow Mushroom, I try to force down some reassembled bits of spinach and chicken.  This salad tastes like disappointment.  And cost $13.48.",

    "text": "I live exactly in the middle of this location and the location at Desert Ridge on Tatum, and we decided to check this one out hoping it would not be as busy and more quiet since it was a week day night.  It sure was not busy at all, maybe 5-6 tables seated in the restaurant when we walked in.  Yet my family of 3, including a toddler, was sat in the bar in a booth that was currently being used as an arm rest for a homeless man (let's just leave it as .... he smelled....) I would have chosen a million other tables for us, but the hostess chose that one. Okay, let's roll with it.  Our waitress quickly greeted us and took our drink order and gave us a minute to decide on food.  By the time she came back with beverages, we put in our order for 2 pizzas.  Those 2 pizzas took almost 45 min to cook.  I get it, they are fresh made to order, but I have never had to wait that long for pizza!  And not once while we sat there trying not to stare at the obnoxious bartender or cringe at the smell wafting from our homeless over-looker did our waitress stop by to see if we needed refills or give us the ol' -your food will be right out- line.  When the pizzas did finally come out, they were piping hot.  I was glad to see that was the only thing this location had in common with the others-- the food is still pretty darn tasty (and worth the usual 20min wait- not 45 min).  We will not return to this location, but will continue frequenting the other locations.  Poor poor poor service....  P.S. Don't order a mixed drink.  My $10 Mojito must of contained the finest mint and simple syrup in the world because that's all the really was.",

I loved their vegetarian options and how many veggies they put on the pizza for such a reasonable price. I hate at other restaurants how much extra that you have to pay for a real veggie pizza. The only reason I gave mellow mushroom a four was the service. Our server seemed to be on crack and was like always running away from our table. At one point I asked for extra napkins, which were not brought with our pizza, and he brought me two. like so random, didn't realize there was a napkin shortage at pizza restaurants. Other than that, best veggie pizza I've ever had!",

Well I'll tell you one thing that wasn't baked, and that was me after waiting forever for our pizza that they messed up. I want reimbursement for the goods we wasted before hand to get proper munchies.   Here's the story. My friends and I all go on a Munchie mission and decide that we should all go to the pizza place, who's theme was being baked. Cool, thanks for that laugh.   The waitress comes, my friend distinctly says all she wants is a BBQ chicken pizza with pineapple. Ok that's confirmed everything cool.   Pizza takes some time...  We get the pizza , and it has bacon on it, which typically isn't an issue if I get some bacon, EXCEPT one of my friends dining with us was Muslim, so they could not consume pork. We request a separate piece with no bacon, and were denied.   So the manager comes out, and what a douche he was. Straight up. Kills everyone's vibes. He doesn't want to fix our pizza, which is just whack.. This isn't a silly dislike or something like that. It's for a legitimate reason. After explaining this, he tried to still have us pay for the pizza, which was not going to happen. After a bit more arguing, he agrees to \"buy\" us the mistake pizza. But not with out five minutes of telling us that he doesn't comp pizzas because he has to pay, and then he can't afford to do that for everyone or he'd be broke. What? You messed up our food!!!! So he doesn't leave us peacefully, he has to put a nail on his own coffin by saying,  \"I'm comping this because I'm religious too\"  I work in food industry, I've managed 2 shops.  Don't bs me about having to pay for kitchen mistakes. That's illegal, it's production cost. Also, don't sit here and look me in my eyes and tell end that the reason you are buying my pizza is because you are religious. The reason you are taking back my food and making it right is because you manage a food establishment, and your only job is to feed the customer. Not to be a good student of god and buy some college students their pizza. Not stoked on this experience. And to the manager, you should not be managing an establishment with such ignorance. On top of that , I wouldn't recommend writing \"comp\" on the receipt, like you did us some sort of radical favor because you had to remake our food.   To end on a good note, the waitress was nice.",

I have been to Mellow Mushroom a few times and I can't tell you enough, how absolutely delicious this place is!  The first time I went, my friend and I shared a Greek Salad and a large Kosmic Karma pizza.  The Greek Salad is superb! (I, of course, removed the raw onions), but seriously, this thing was loaded with flavor! Lots of Feta cheese, kalamata olives, banana peppers and a very light but tasty dressing...WOW! Was perfect for a warm spring day in Arizona!    Now on to the pizza...Kosmic Karma! Karma is not a B...it is a party in your mouth.  A very simple pizza, red sauce, spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, and the pies de resistance...the most beautiful swirl of pesto that encompasses all the flavors into one pie of perfection! Oh but wait! That's not the kicker...THE CRUST! You know it's a good crust when you hear it crunch when you bite and then all of a sudden it's just that perfect soft doughy-ness that you have always wanted? Yeah..that's it! Seriously!   So that was just the one visit!  My most recent vist was just a couple of weeks ago after a hellacious week of learning and thinking...we just needed some time to unwind and Mellow Mushroom was the perfect spot for myself and a couple of girlfriends to relax and enjoy some mindless chatter and good food!    Upon suggestion of one of the girls, we started off with the garlic pretzels, which to my surprise and complete satisfaction...are made of...THE CRUST! *insert teenage Bieber fan squeee here* Yes folks, you read correctly...THE CRUST that is perfection in my book! Garlicy and doughy and crusty crust with a side of very tasty marinara dipping sauce! For like $3.50 you get 3 full size soft pretzels.  Not bad at all.    Then came the pizza! I am a creature of habit and ordered the Kosmic Karma.  I believe that what comes around goes around and I wanted to see that pesto swirl go around my pizza pie one more time! I wasn't let down either! It was another one of those moments where you end up making those \"happy food\" noises while eating.  No shame! I noticed my two friends were doing the same! One ordered the Philosopher's pie (steak, portabello mushrooms, artichokes) and the other ordered the Caesar  (literally a Caesar salad on a garlic pesto based sauce).  We left with our leftovers and I can say I was just as giddy to have them the next day as I was when it was first brought to the table! (Just make sure you heat them up in the oven so they don't have that nasty microvwav  Needless to say, we were very happy! They really need to make one of these places on the West Side!  It's worth the drive though!",

    "text": "OK as I have mentioned in other reviews I am new to Tempe and am searching for good gluten free foods.  Pizza in particular.  We called and had pizzas delivered.  The only downside was that it took about 40 minutes to get it, but hey......it was a Saturday night, what did I expect?!!  Was it worth the wait?  Yes, absolutely.   I went with the gluten free gourmet white pizza (olive oil and garlic base with sun dried tomatoes, provolone, mozzarella, feta, tomatoes and onions) for kicks I added bacon.  When I opened the box it looked ok, but the smell made my mouth water!  I could barely wait to get it on a plate.  At first I was not sure about the crust, but it was REALLY good!  The crust is vegan and unlike any gluten free crust I have had.  Great texture and flavor.  This pizza was so good I ate the entire thing........granted it is a 12\" one, but man!  I WILL be ordering this again soon.  I am anxious to try the other flavors, especially the Kosmic Karma.  Well done Mellow Mushroom!  PS - if you are thinking about this, please be sure to read their policy on their gluten free pizzas.  They take that extra step to make sure that it is not contaminated from the other things in the kitchen.  We all know that in a kitchen that serves gluten items, you can't completely avoid cross-contamination, but the steps they take make me feel better about eating here.",

That's assuming you can get a server or bartender to serve you.  We walked in around 1am. Every single table in the bar area was dirty. All of them. So we grabbed drinks at the bar and went outside. Two more dirty tables out there. We hung out on the patio for an hour sipping our cocktails. Upon leaving an hour later, ALL the tables were still dirty! Aside from the 10 or so people a the bar, my party of four was the only group in here! Dirty tables are a sign of a lazy bartender/server. Clearly they don't want to make money and don't want anyone sitting there.   The upside was that because it was so dead, it was a nice break from the noisy Mill crowd.",

The service is always slow, the food doesn't seem fresh or of high quality.

Jesse was funny and really made our night. I can honestly say that we have never experienced such a great bartender. He was proud of where he worked, and that says a lot about a company. We even tried to tip him on the side, however due to him being the kitchen manager and just out in the front of house helping because that's what he likes to do, he denied our tip. He even spoke very highly of the other bartender, who was great as well. I'm sorry I don't remember her name! Jesse definitely deserves something special for all his hard work, and we will definitely be back to see him more often! The food was great as well, we ordered a Caesar salad and a pepperoni pizza, extra pepperonis. They sure did it right! Thanks for the great food and the awesome experience!",

I ended up getting a small pizza with pepperoni and parmesan cheese. The crust of the pizza had a really good, possibly buttery, flavor that was just delicious. Another positive about the crust was that they didn't burn it so it was still a tad bit chewy and not all dried out.   While that was my first trip to Mellow Mushroom, it certainly won't be my last.

    "text": "Let me thank the Mellow Mushroom in Tempe, Arizona for the absolute worst restaurant experience I've had in years.  This was brought to us by a lack of management oversight and our \"server\" Sierra. We just walked out after 65 minutes of complete torture. Buckle in because this is one hell of a ride.   When we arrived, one of the first things we noticed that the restaurant is nearly empty with the exception of about three or four tables. This should have been our first indication of what we to come since it was 5:00 PM on a Sunday. We were greeted and sat quickly. That's where the positives end.    We sat, and sat and sat waiting for ANYONE to acknowledge we existed. It's hard to do in an empty restaurant because after 14 minutes of being completely ignored the hostess walked by and could see our frustration starting to build. She walked over, and  I'm not sure why, but she brought us two plates and said. \"She'll be right with you,\" turned away and left.    Fast forward to another 10 minutes, and we were approached, not greeted, by Sierra.  The word \"server\" is in quotations above because she did not serve us- - at all.  25 minutes after we first walked into the restaurant, we ordered an ice tea and asked about the two apple ciders on the menu.  Sierra knew nothing about them or what the differences were.  I settled on one and also ordered the bruschetta to start off with. The drinks were delivered within a few minutes.  We asked for straws and ordered a sandwich and a calzone. I went to the restroom and walked into what looked like a roadside rest stop complete with trash on the floor and graffiti everywhere. It was filthy!  Back at the table, the bruschetta arrived, and we asked for straws again....and then again... so I guess the third time was a charm because we finally got them; which is more than I can say about our dinner.  We attempted to flag down our \"server\" Sierra, but I can only assume she was kidnapped or abducted by aliens because she was never to be seen again.  At this point, we've now been in the restaurant for an hour.  We had to flag down two different people to ask about our dinners.  I had a clear view of the kitchen and could see there was no order for us. The kitchen staff called over another guy, (maybe another server or supervisor) and started talking to him about us.  It was obvious because they kept looking at our table. The cook yelled out into the restaurant \"SIERRA\"..... At that point, that same guy talking to the cook, approached the table and asked, \"How are you\"? I told him I was extremely frustrated and wanted to know where food was.  He said, \"I just came in and have no idea what is happening.\"  Thank you, but this was obviously the case because no one had any idea what was going on.   At that point and after an hour with no food and no Sierra- we left.  Looking back on our experience last night, I guess if we were desperate enough we could've easily had a complete meal by collecting all of the food that was lying around on the floor in the restaurant.   Accidents happen, servers forget to ring in orders;  I understand that, but the complete lack of oversight, awareness and management supervision in this restaurant resulted in a pathetic attempt of running this business. I would guarantee that this location is down in sales and they can't figure out why.....",

The food is way over priced for what it is, there are a ton of other restaurants in the area that all have to keep the quality of food good & prices fair (competitive). Nowadays with the economy- shouldn't we expect more for our hard earned buck! Well my first & only experience was St. Pattys day, I sat at the bar, had ordered a sandwich to go, since the takeout entrance did not have a noticeable sign out front.     The 45 minute wait and $11 hoagie!!! which by the way was supposed to be HOT, was tepid, yes technically cold! I didn't feel like giving a tip for a takeout, especially at that price, but the bartender gave me a nasty sneer when she saw the signed ticket, which service can make or break any restaurant, but this was just nasty! I wrote a letter to the management and in hopes they would get their act together, but from the mixed reviews, and by method of deduction, still having problems.      Seems to me just another new establishment who is way over priced for the value! Places like this take advantage of the public and it's shameful. But far be it from me to begrudge someone from earning a living, I'm all in favor of making a buck just like any other normal person, just make prices more reasonable and food quality better, growing pains I guess...(just keeping it optimistic) Make it right= recipe for success, or Continue same path=recipe for matter of time before out of business.  No I will not be visiting this place again, NOR would I recommend this to anyone I would not want to get food poisoning!   I hope this review was helpful fellow yelpers!",

It wasn't even pink 2) the girl rimmed the glass with salt. Is that something new that literally I've never had done to a Bloody Mary? 3) there seemed to be enough alcohol but overall it was gross and I only took a couple sips. Would have been nice if bartender/server noticed it not being drank and inquired.  Food is good but save your money and do not order mixed drinks.",

He took our drink order and ran off, never got a chance to order. Again it took a long time for him to return. When he dropped off our drinks he ran off and said he would be right back. After waiting a while he still had not returned. We got up and went across the street to Zipps.",

I have brought tons of friends here and they've all loved it. Yesterday, my boyfriend and I came for his first vegan pizza. He's a picky eater, but after picking off all the veggies, he seemed to enjoy it. The service is always outstanding and even when they're packed the timing is great.  Not to mention their huge list of 48 beers on tap!! They even have Papago (which I love!)  If only they were a bit cheaper (or didn't charge extra for vegan cheese!)",

For table service, They didn't have beer lists one day so we had to walk from our table to lean over the bar to see what they had on draft.... Kind of awkward.. But okay.  Happy hour is pretty awesome though, cheap beer (great selection) and even cheaper appetizers. (How do you go wrong with half priced?) 4 dollars vs 8 dollars? I'll order two! I really liked the bruschetta (it's a little sweet) but the by-far best thing there is the spinach artichoke dip. It's the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. Don't know if I'd come here outside of happy hour cause the food seems a tad bit expensive, or maybe I'm just super cheap. Hahah  Every time I come here it's super slow, which can actually be nice for a mill ave place since you can hear yourself think and it doesn't get rowdy. At least from what I experienced.",

    "text": "So I have a pretty critical review of this place from my experiences last night. I just got off of work and met up with some friends to grab some dinner for my friends birthday. As soon as we walk in we are greeted with a rough looking guy demanding our ID's and being pretty stern. I thought I was walking in a douche bag party bar or club not a restaurant. There were two other groups there trying to get in and people handing ID's over top of each other. It was very disorganized and irritating but what ever. We got our ID's checked and our wrist bands so we could sit down to dinner.....  So we got sat and handed some menu's. Our waitress asked for our ID's again and was confused as to why we had wrist bands on. We told her the guy up front took our ID's already and wrist banded us. She walked away real quickly and came back telling us not to worry about showing her our ID's again. We gave her our drink orders and she came back pretty quickly. We needed a little more time to look over the menu so she came back.   I looked over the menu and was not terribly impressed. The food selection was blah but I figured it is a pizza place and their pizza selection was pretty decent so not a huge deal. I ended up getting a spiked sausage hoagie. It was small and unimpressive. It came with chips that tasted like they dumped them out of a lays bag. It was not a hoagie but more just a few small slices of sausage with huge chunks of green bell peppers with melted cheese between two tiny slices of bread. It tasted ok but for $9 I expected a lot more.   The service was slow, like really slow. the waitress could have easily doubled or tripled her alcohol sales if she would have just hustled a little. Our food orders came out one at a time with a few minutes between each plate. Some of my friends split a moderately sized pizza that looked ok, I didn't try it. Another ordered a calzone that was also moderately sized. And the last friend ordered a personal pizza. Everyone was really surprised at how small my sandwich was, I am really glad I didn't get a half sandwich. One of my friends gave me a slice of his personal pizza a BBQ chicken pizza of some kind that was better than my sandwich.   To kind of summarize this entire review the food is alright, the service was incredibly slow, the bouncer/security guy was annoying, and the prices are ridicules. You can go to any other restaurant on mill, even any of the other pizza places and get more and better food for your money. I don't know why people rave about this place at all, makes me think they have no idea what good pizza is supposed to be.",

    "text": "This review is only for the Mellow Mushroom House Special pizza.   I am a Foodie and combination pizza and crab are my favorite foods.  My favorite pizza in Phoenix metro is Mellow Mushroom's House Special, because of the crispy applewood smoked bacon in it, and I love combo pizzas.  I discovered their pizza when they ran the Groupon $10 for $20.  Mellow Mushroom really packs on the ingredients and spreads to the edges, but the crust is not crispy and can never be made crispy the way I like it by baking it longer, probably because of the dough ingredients.   I tried asking restaurant to bake pizza longer for  \"extra crispy crust\", but it does not make for a crispier crust, just drys out the ingredients.  I would give House Special pizza 5 stars if the crust could get crispy and crunch when you bite into it and not flop downward (wimpy).    I love it when my teeth find the crispy applewood bacon pieces crunching in my mouth.  Ummmmm, makes me happy!  The House Special pizza is so good, I have not ventured to order anything else here.  Freezing the pieces and then toasting on my toaster oven rack on another day, is a special treat, I can get the crust crispier at home.  I have not had bad service here either and I like to sit with my laptop and eat pizza alone.  I have to come here after 10 pm weekdays for free parking and quieter atmosphere, another reason for not giving it 5 stars.    Grimaldi's has good pizza too, for me, anyhow.  I like thin CRISPY crust that crunches even in the center when you bite into it, and slice stays horizontal even 30 min after coming out of the oven.    I have tried Pizzeria Bianco at 20th and Camelback, horrid ( like spoiled milk) and overpriced, the only pizza I ever sent back to order something else, in my 64 years  life, see my Pizzeria Bianco review.    I have not tried Cibo's.  I like pizza with lotsa stuff on it, like combos, so Cibo's is probably not my place either.  Anyone have other recommendations, based on the kind of pizza I described I like here, I welcome your suggestions.",

The spinach artichoke dip appetizer was really delicious and during happy hour, all appetizers are half-off. We had the \"Great White\" pizza, which was delicious as always. It seemed extra greasy tonight, but it seemed like they added a bit of extra oil to the oil base that comes on that particular pizza for some reason.

This was also on a Sunday night so I expected a little more honestly.   We tried pretzel bites with beer cheese, pesto garlic cheese bread, and cosmic karma pizza. True rating: 3/5   The beer cheese was eh. The garlic bread was good! The cosmic pizza was good but needed to be cooked a little longer as the bottom of the crust was soft and not crispy.    You gotta have that crisp!!   I liked their menu design but I was expecting that same vibe throughout the entire restaurant.   We had good customer service but being my first time there I expected a little more. It also took a little long for our food to arrive and to receive our bill. We had to walk up to the counter to pay.",

The food was decent, but nothing special. Our service was SLOW (and it didn't even appear to be busy in the restaurant). Not sure we'd come back.

We were trying to catch a movie so couldn't even wait to have them spend another 20 minutes remaking our two items. When we finally got the attention of the server we just explained that it was cold and couldn't wait for a remake. His response was \"Ok.\" Didn't apologize, didn't ask how he could make it up. Closed us out for our beer, didn't offer to buy it. And never once even remotely showed remorse. I've worked in service industry and this is completely ridiculous. Won't be returning.",

I dropped almost $200 at this place and cannot understand how this place stays in business. It was an off time since this place is right next to ASU and school was on break, but the food quality and service was horrible. Mostly the food but the service was barely acceptable. To start we ordered some of their pretzels, beer cheese, wings and some salads. Right out of the gate, they served us wings with rotting celery on the plate. I showed the waitress and she was like oh, we will get this fixed and go get new celery. She then brought back the same celery but cut in smaller pieces. I wish I had taken a picture...disgusting. We had to wait for beer a couple times and what I assume is the \"brew master\" served us twice and both times stuck his finger in the beer when dropping a piece of lemon in it. The pizza was no better than a grocery frozen dinner version and they obviously do not care about the presentation nor the quality. Given it is located in a school town, you would also expect it to be reasonably priced, but it is not.",

All they had were slices which was perfect because that's all I wanted. Plus it was reverse happy hour so it kinda defeated the purpose of the pizza but it was totally worth it. I have been here several times and I have to say that I would only recommend coming here on Tuesdays after midnight because it was really chill. You can't get a whole pizza at that time but you can get several slices to plug your gut. The bartender was a little weird. Or I could have just been really tipsy. Either way it was really empty and there was plenty of seating outside. Definitely recommend if you're wasted on Mill ave on a week night.",

The service has always been a downside...but for good food its something I'm willing to work with. After we had left we noticed that they charged our card wrong and we left the card there. We went back in to pick up the credit card and discuss the charge and it went downhill from there.  The manager that we spoke with didn't ask for any identification before handing us the credit card, and didn't even ask for a name. After saying we left our card here they just handed us the card. I find that a bit scary.  But when we were talking to the manager I was so insulted. The manager was extremely unprofessional. He was constantly swearing and before even hearing us out was already saying that we must be in the wrong about what had happened regarding the charge. I don't expect to go in and have someone just take my word for it but I requested the manager to look at the cameras before doing anything because they have cameras everywhere. About 20 minutes into the conversation the manager called the person I was with an a**hole. While I was still standing there talking to him. I get the situation was frustrating for both of us, but for someone who is representing the business as a manager to speak to anyone that way is uncalled for. After that experience I won't be going back, even if I love their food.",

I've watched it being built for a few months now with promises of great exotic pizzas and fifty draft beers and I couldn't wait to try it. Kristen and I showed up at four thirty(I have a very early work schedule hence the grandparent like dinner time) and we were greeted by a bunch of enthusiastic employees, it was fun, they must have had all the employees on for the opening. The Mellow Mushroom is sort of eclectic inside, a mix of modern style with urban influences and some typical pizza parlor flair. It was welcoming and they played a wide range of music from the rat pack to techno. They also have a cute little store where they sell their shirts and pint glasses and whatnot. Okay, it being the opening we relied heavily on our great servers advice, he suggested the pretzes to start so we ordered half cinnamon and honey, and half garlic butter and parmesan. It came with six HUGE pretzels, three took up a large pizza tray, we had no idea they were so big. Kristen liked the sweet ones more and I liked the garlic parmesan, but both were great(and with half off happy hour they were only three dollars!) We then had the Kosmic Karma pizza, we made some substitutions suggested by the server and ended up with a 14\" olive oil and garlic base pie with mozarella, spinach, feta, roma tomatoes and pesto sauce. It was wonderful, every ingredient brought something great to the table and the crust was awesome. The pizza is not cheap but not over the top expensive either, it makes sense, they use very good ingredients.  So to sum it up, we really like Mellow Mushroom and will be back. From the wonderful happy hour(half off all appetizers and most alcohol), to the large beer selection with a bunch of local brews and the delicious pizza, we are pleased to have this new pizza joint in the neighborhood.",

The quality of the ingredients and especially the flavor of the crust were excellent, and there is an extensive tap-beer selection and full bar. But I had to dock a star for the prices - like almost everyone else on this site, I feel that they're charging probably about $5 more than they should for the size of the pizza you're getting.

    "text": "If you are ready for a \"kosmic\" experience, you MUST try the Kosmic Karma pizza at Mellow Mushroom! I am the definition of a carb loving woman, and the thick whole grain crust satisfies every craving I have! Now for the best part - the toppings. My mouth is watering just thinking about the warm mozzarella, the fresh feta and the pesto that form this out of world experience! Wash it all down with a dark stout and you'll be in food lovers paradise!  The environment is fun and spunky. The graffiti on the walls make for good talking topic (look at the arrow above the kitchen and see what comes to mind!). Being located on Mill Ave in the heart of Downtown Tempe is super convenient and makes this the perfect starting point for a fun night on the town! On a personal point - the patio is fabulous, however you want to get a table in the back. We have had panhandlers approach us for left over food & money each time we sat too close to the street!",

I scanned the chalkboard list of beers (not even close to a list of all the beers they had on tap).  I asked the bartended if I could taste the nut brown ale and he immediately poured me a sampler at no charge (as it should be everywhere).  It was a bit bitter for my taste but our waiter had suggestions for us.  One of us said he like Shock Top (I know, I chastised him for his beer preference) and the waiter immediately suggested a Hef that my friend said was quite good.  I said I like Newcastle and he suggested a brown ale which was excellent.  A third member of our party selected one of the multiple porters available. We ordered two pizzas, one with all meat on 1/2 and a specialty pizaa on the other half.  The other was 1/2 carne asada with kalamata olives (that has to be the most creative combination on a pizza that I've yet come across), the other 1/2 chicken, artichoke and garlic.  The crust on both pizzas was very good, thick but not overly filling. The staff all seemed really friendly and casual.  If they're students (this is near ASU) they didn't come across as smug hipsters or anything of that sort.  They were genuinely friendly to us (3 40+ year olds and one teenage girl).",

Last night I invited 3 friends who had never been to this restaurant for happy hour. The bartender argued with me about the drink I ordered, which wasn't alcoholic to begin with. Took them over 15 minutes to take our order and there was no particular attention or checkup on how we were doing. The \"so called\" manager who I called and spoke to this morning happened to be the same guy who was chit-chatting with the bartender, instead of serving us or providing elite service. May this be a lesson learned to your company as I will take this matter to the corporate level. It's a shame to see the kind of management running this place when there's no certain reassurance on the type of expected service most loyal customers are accustomed to when they bring other clients into the scene.",

We decided to grab something for me to go and get the heck out of there and grab something for her on the way home. It took an hour after deciding that to get my calzone. Now, I totally understand having to bake something but if it is going to take that long and you know it is now a take out order, you better say something.

I love that each one is so different. It's obvious they let them do their own thing, even though it's a chain.   Went to the one in Tempe the week it opened. We had to convince our friends that it was worth it for six of us to get two large pizzas, but once they tasted it they understood why. Their specialty pizzas (the gourmet white is my favorite) are amazing and they have the best dough. (I don't know if they do it at this location, but I used to buy just their raw dough to make my own pizza at home- it's that good.) Toppings were generous and fresh. The pizza took a little while to get to us, but what good pizza doesn't?  The service was great, too. We let our server know that we were heading to a concert after dinner and he did a great job of keeping the beers coming and getting our checks to us fast, even though they were pretty busy.   I absolutely recommend it!",

By the time everyone managed to get to the area pretty much everywhere else was closed (it was a Sunday night). Another restaurant who had just closed their kitchen recommended them.  Comfortable relaxed atmosphere. Speedy service. When the food came it was amazing. We had a big group with 4 different options to share and everything was spectacular. My favorite was the spinach artichoke dip. Price was not expensive at all for quality of food. If you are looking to pay $5 for a Little Ceaser's style pizza this is not your bar/restaurant, but if you want great food for a fair price then give this place a try.  Watched the wait staff and manager not only provide excellent service to us all night but go above and beyond for two separate nearby patrons throughout the evening.

Respect for that. Great to see to someone paying such close attention to their customers. This can only be a good thing. The same draft selection as the first time around.  48 Handles.  Thats a lot of beer.  As said in my first reiview, with 48 handles I would Love to see more variety and a bit more imagination with respect to the draft beer choices, then again who would complain about a selection w/ at least 40 craft beers on tap?   Thats a real commitment.  Our bartender Madison was enthusiastic about what she was serving which in Arizona's growing craft beer community is a big plus.  On a another note, this time around the food I ordered made it out of the kitchen rather quickly.  Just a mediterainan salad, but nice. All said, great to see another craft beer brother join the club.  Nice to have you here.",

    "text": "I've been here about 3-4 times since it's opening & each time the service has been consistently poor, tolerable but definitely below par. I have continued to go back hoping it was a \"working the kinks\" out situation & as they were open longer everything would fall into place - NO WAY. I will never go back. Our experience last night by far topped the list of mouth open this-is-so-ridiculous-I-can't-believe-it-is-actually-happening-in-real-life.   The menu says **ask about our gluten free beers** so I did & was informed the only gf beer was pear cider. Slightly annoyed because the menu is a little misleading.  After the bartender got our drinks, our actual server took forever to come to the table (even though she walked back & forth 3-4 times) We wanted a gluten free pizza so I asked her what size the gf crust was & she said 10 inches. We ordered 2 pizzas, asking for no cheese on both. We also \"built our own salad\" asking specifically if the green olives were pitted & ordered those - our salad come to the table with black olives. She came back to our table awhile later & sits down next to me (this may sound stuck up/prissy whatever but seriously, I don't know you & I did NOT come to hang out or sit by you  & I find it incredible tacky & invading to sit down without being asked just so you don't have to stand up while you talk with us) & says \"do you have an allergy\"  excuse me, what?  \" do you have a gluten allergy? or are you just trying to be healthy or eat better or something because our crust is actually healthier, that gluten free crust has preservatives and eggs and its not healthy at all\"  um again, excuse me?? I have 2 years of nutrition classes under my belt, have worked with acupuncturists, herbalists, quantum biofeedback specialists, naturopaths, and spend hours doing personal research, experiments, and reading of my own and YOU in 1 sentence are going to speculate on my food choices, make me feel self conscious & without any actual facts or data or education tell me that something is healthy & something else is not healthy for me. This is absolutely unacceptable in my eyes & downright rude.   She then goes on to explain that there are other aspects of the pizza's that aren't gluten free & we need to order off the gluten free menu, um HELLO?? Why is it that I am just being told about this menu now, wouldn't you have thought to bring to my attention there is a gluten free menu when I first asked about the gluten free crust?  She brings the menu and it says the crust is in fact 12 inches (didn't I just ask her this question & she said 10?)   so now we decide we only need 1 pizza & want to stick with the thai dye pie (I had heard its really tasty). She says its not on the gluten free menu & other things about it (not just the crust) have gluten. ok, so what are the other 'things'?   She checks and comes back and says the sauce.I ask what other sauces could be used and she says none, you need to order off the gluten free menu. seriously WTF at this point.  My husband doesn't want to go sauce-less because the pizza will be super dry so I say that's fine, I am sure a little sauce won't be a big deal for my stomach & I only plan on eating 1-2 pieces at most anyways.   Instead of just taking our order as is our server then responds w/ \"do you have an allergy or not\"  so rude, & most importantly, If she is going to go around giving health advice she should at least have a basic understanding of gluten, what it is, how it affects people, allergies, etc. gluten is not black & white, if you are allergic you don't eat one speck & break into convulsions like some people may from beans, peanuts, etc. It affects everybody differently ranging from malabsorption of nutrients, gas, bloating, headaches, leaky gut, etc. etc. - full blown celiacs have a much harder time & need to ensure no gluten is ever consumed, while some people just try to make prudent choices when available to limit the amount of adverse digestive problems that accompany consumption of gluten. There is also no reason why I should have to explain this, myself, or my choices to the server - especially when she is having a bad attitude.  She finally goes away and our pizza comes out (over 30 minutes later) w/ yep, tons of melted cheese all over the place.   We sent it back & when she came back told her what happened & said we wanted it togo, not only did she not apologize she didn't even say anything. We finally got the correct pizza & it was pathetic. There were barely any toppings & she had them put the sauce on the side, saying \"she still didnt understand if we had an allergy or not\" AAAAHHH!   While waiting for our check she sat down hugging the guy at the table next to ours carrying on personal conversations, etc.  helloooo??? we need our bill!   no coupons, no apologies, nothing. I was a server for 5 years & I would NEVER let my husband tip someone $0 but I was so upset we left the exact amount and got out of there as fast as possible.",

I lost count of how many instances where the server forgot our order or brought incomplete orders.  The bartender was very nice   I may consider going to the bar.  I will not likely go back to the restaurant.",

A group of eight people and very few other customers we received poor service. It took a while to receive our drinks and once we got our food after waiting for over an hour, several personal pizzas were delivered to our table UNCOOKED. They returned their pizzas and the second pizzas they brought back were not what they order. They still even charged those guest. Several guest had major stomach aches from the uncooked food. A big disappointment for Mellow Mushroom.",

The manager there, Billy, is absolutely one of the most outgoing and hands on managers I've seen in a very long time.  He makes sure that his customers are happy and his employees are never standing still.  When things get busy, I've seen Billy as much a part of the service as anyone else.   Highly Recommended!!",

    "text": "Sadly nothing has changed. The fact is if your over 25 and believe that service is important this is not the place for you. Huge place with approximately 25 patrons and 25 workers. This time I went with 3 people or 2 couples. We were seated and then forgotten. We watched other \"kids\" who came in after us order and get drinks, then place there food order it was obvious that we would have to get up and ask for a server. After 22 minutes we did.  Wow we can order. Server asks us what we would like and we ask for the extensive beer menu which could have and should have been given to each person when we were seated. He returns with one and stands there waiting for our order. Yes 1 for 4 people and wants an instant order. So finally we order and in only 15 minutes we get our drinks minus 2 that he forgot but did return in 10 minutes with the soft drinks.  OUR FOOD order came out quicker than the drinks but interestingly the other \"kids\" who had come in after us were already DONE EATING AND GONE.  Chopped salad looked like I had asked my kids to make it. We upgraded and ordered chicken to be added and found that it and some black olives were the only chopped item on the plate. It was served with two tiny plastic cups of dressing hardly enough for the salad but it was fine with us as we didn't eat it.  McDonalds would not have served this and perhaps the management should hop in their car and go to Picazzo's and see a chopped salad. Pizzas came out and were average and on one there was no sign of sauce anywhere under the cheese. Perhaps they forgot it or there was so little it went onto 1 slice.  Well we would have loved to have had more drinks or refills but a table of girls came in and for 30 minutes it became the only important thing for our server. Finally we gave up and one of us walked to the hostess and asked for our check. About 15 minutes later he arrived with the bill and just left it on the table in between all of our dirty plates, glasses and silverware and walked away.    It was extremely hot the night we were in and every 5 minutes a young guy wearing a camoflouge shirt or hat I don't rememeber was adjusting the A/C.  I am not sure he even worked there as everyone else has on black t's.  In my 1st review I suggested this restaurant would be struggling during the summer when they would have to count on locals for support. 25 people on a Friday night might be a True indicator.  The manager asked me to come back in and give them another chance.  Same result. Sorry MM but look up and down Mill and see restaurant spaces empty because they assumed the kids of ASU would support them and keep them in the green.",

We stood at the front waiting to be sat while every server stared at us. After getting seated it took a while for the server to get to us and get our drink orders taken which was not a big deal because it was lunch rush. A simple, hey I'm busy I apologize about the wait would have been nice though. Ordered 2 sandwiches and a small pizza which took 1 hour and 20 minutes. Not so happy at this point since the place has cleared out by now. Manager came over and took 50% off my sandwich since I waited over an hour to get the wrong thing which was nice of him but the bill was still $46 after that. I asked him what a normal ticket time is for a sandwich and he said 10 minutes...weird.  Moral of the story....order to go!",

The disappointment of not seeing any hot ASU broads was only the beginning of a variety of disappointments during this lunch. So lets start with the good. The waitress was nice. Ok, now the bad: I ordered the lunch special pizza which was an 8 inch pizza and a drink for like $6. The waitress warned me that the pizza \"was extremely small\" (at least i think she was talking about pizza) so anyways i ordered 2 of them. When the pizza came out, I wouldn't have been surprised if i saw part of a Digornos pizza box stuck to the bottom of the pizza. What is wrong with pizza in Arizona?! I've never been to big city where saying the word \"Domino's\" causes very moist orgasms.  Mellow Mushroom tries way too hard with the crust, they sprinkle this garlic dust all over it and it sucked. It tasted like you were trying to eat an old shiny piece of bread. The cheese was so thick and rubbery, you could probably use it to cover severe war wounds  This place blew big ones, it had cool decorations on the walls, but i can't  friggin eat decorations.",

She we got there (around 5:30pm on a Thursday night) we were happy to be seated right away. The hostess was nice and our server came right over and took our drink order. Happy hour was going on (half priced bar drinks, except bombers) but we didn't order drinks this night.   Thinking that pizza would allow us to have an easy dinner and share was a mistake on my part. First glance at the kid's menu and the little ones could really care less about sharing pizza with mom and dad. The girls decided on the meatballs and Mac and cheese. Our server let us know that all specialty pies could be made half and half so we ordered half with the Red Potato option and the other half Magic Mushroom.  The wait time was average and all food arrived to the table hot. Hubby and I didn't share  with each other so I can't comment on his choice, but he seemed the enjoy it. My choice was pretty good...nice amount of potatoes, bacon, and the sauce was spicy but not inedible. It was good. The crust held the toppings well, but it was wheat. Blech. I didn't see crust options on the menu (besides gluten free), only that they brush it with garlic and parm (which was really light btw),  but I really wish there was a white dough. Just like I prefer my pb & j on white bread, I prefer my pizza on white dough. I am able to overlook this though...there are other pizzas I want to try so if that means that I have to eat a wheat crust then so be it.  So why 3 stars then? It all comes down to the kid's menu. $5.50 for a kid's entree (includes drink). Not horrible. We eat out a lot, the price is average. The serving size however, is not. Like I said, one child got the meatballs. Granted, she LOVED them, but she got 3. 3!!! Now we can split hairs and say, \"there were actually six\", but they were small, with cheese in the middle, and when put together made three regular balls. Slap a little sauce on it and serve it with some apples that were cut at 11am, and you have yourself a meal for a four year old. Problem is my little one is almost eight and she was still hungry. The other little one ordered Mac and cheese. Thanks for putting some Annie's boxed stuff under the broiler. Ugh...I hate paying so much for boxed crap (even if it is natural and not Kraft).  So the lesson is, take your family, share a pizza, Don't order off the kid's menu unless you are into wasting money, and get here during happy hour.",

The pretzel app was tasty, but it was simply pizza dough in a pretzel shape. Beer cheese was ok, but cost just as much as the pretzels ($3.29). The hostess staff is in booty shorts which I don't prefer to look at while eating (call me a prude haha). The vibe is trendy, but inauthentic. I was hoping for a neighborhood type feel and some good pizza - this place falls short of that.  Overall I wouldn't recommend and won't be frequenting this place.",

    "text": "Two words: Vastly Overpriced.   Mellow Mushroom is hippie-chic for the trust-fund stoner. The place has a clean, bistro-ish feel, service is good (our waiter was a trainee and provided better service than many veterans), and the general ambience is pleasant.   The food quality is on the high end of average, but the prices... just looking at the prices made me dizzy from the moment I cracked the menu open. For drink and a small portion of whatever you end up being interested in, expect to pay around $12, before tipping. Small pizzas ranged up to $13. Drinks are $3 each, some of which don't come with any refill service.   The people aren't the problem at Mellow Mushroom, the cash-grab is. It isn't anywhere close to earning the kind of prices on the menu.   Thumbs down. The people who work here deserve not to have to be associated with (and probably forced to answer for) the prices.   Skip Mellow Mushroom. There's plenty of other stuff on Mill.",

I like to give any place a minimum of 3 try's,(maybe there was an off day in the kitchen, my sever was having a bad day, or the bar was not able to provide a good drink nor customer service). I am not quick to judge but when I come in again after previous negative experiences, I will write a review for sure.   My history with pizza has never had such a low point. No actual flavor, except oil and even greaser cheese, which I don't know how is possible, but it happened, and a greasy crust, and the thing is that it was supposed to be some sort of baked potato with fixings as toppings but turned out to be a waste of my time and money. I know this particular pizza is an oil base instead of a red sauce, but seriously, I shouldn't be able to squeeze oil out of a pizza slice. Have you ever? May have well as brought out a garbage can and told me to eat out of it. There would have been more flavor at least. I don't know how they have been in business these years and I feel they are just panning to the lowest common denominator of clientele... Fail Mellow Mushroom. Absolute fail on multiple occasions",

When I asked if it came with chips, the server said \"yes, when we have some\".  The 2nd time I had the Meatball hoagie.  The \"whole\" meatball hoagie had 3 (yes 3) meatballs and was served with about a dozen potato chips.  So does that mean the \"half\" meatball hoagie has 1 1/2 meatballs?  The sandwich tasted OK, but I think would be better on their french roll (instead of the sourdough which I had).  I was very pleasantly surprised with the beer selection.    The service was OK.  Overall, I thought it was over priced and the food was average.  I will say, their pizza does look good, so if I go back that is what I will try.",

They don't give change.  They don't have a dedicated lot - they have metered parking right outside their doors.  Grrrrreat policy, Mellow Mushroom.  Food is on a par with the other MM in town.  Service varies depending on the server, many of which have attitudes.  Draft list is long, but much of it isn't of much interest to anyone who's been into craft beer for awhile.    Good location on Mill.  Looks like that's why they'll stay in business, and for no other reason.",

They are frequently featured on Groupon for $10 buys a $20 coupon.  We only get a short break for lunch so normally will do the to go option and have used the groupon and had the remainder put on a gift card to use later on in the week.  I just had this option refused for the first time by the 'general manager' and left the restaurant without my lunch.  Now I've got to cancel this groupon as I'm never going to spend $20 in food at one time on myself and won't be going to mellow mushroom again-horrible customer service.",

The ambiance of the restaurant is very \"chain like\", not really what I was expecting(yes, I do know it's a chain). Our server, Ashley, was very nice, and attentive. She didn't let any of our drinks go with out refills, and she split our large table's check for us with out us even having to ask! The food was pretty good. We had the drunken fun guy(?) appetizer and the BBQ chicken pizza. Both were good, not amazing, but good. Everything tasted a little 'processed' or maybe just not very fresh. The crust was good and crisp, but had an almost microwaved texture to it, like it was old... I might give them another try, I just don't know if it's really the place for me...",

    "text": "Last week, a group of us went into the Mellow Mushroom restaurant in Tempe to have a \"quick\" lunch before a 1pm meeting. We got there at Noon, ordered and then waited, and waited, and waited. At 12:50pm I told my waitress that I had a 1pm meeting and please run my card now so I can take my food and run to my meeting. Well, I get my food at 1pm and it is the wrong order. Argghhh!! So I have the waitress send it back to the kitchen and have one of my coworkers bring it to me, but I am still waiting for my card which I gave to her 10 minutes ago and I have to go this meeting that I am already late for. My co-worker signs my card and I get my cold food later and again it's the wrong order. I eat it anyways and can't lie, it tasted really good.  Fast forward to today, where a co-worker and I had another 1pm meeting. We decide to work through lunch and order take out from them and give them another chance. I make our orders at 12:05pm and the girl says that it will take 20 minutes. So I go to pick them up at 12:30pm and they aren't ready. So again, I wait, and wait, and wait. While I am waiting I hear the kitchen manager and a server talking about a table where the customer was not so happy about having to wait so long for their food and was trying to get a discount. At that moment I hear the kitchen manager refer to the customer that is arguing this as a \"douchebag\". My jaw just dropped at what I have just heard. I have to go outside because I don't wanna hear more. So I continue to wait until I get our food at 12:55pm, 30 minutes after it was promised to me, we end up having to eat our food during our meeting. Uggh.   Now the food is great here, they do an great job at this but the customer service is absolutely dreadful and that is being nice. Surprising because there is usually 25 people working in there at one time. I do not recommend Mellow Mushroom unless you have a lot of time and patience, and don't mind the kitchen staff calling you \"douchebag\" and other names behind your back. I'll pass",

    "text": "My wife and I went here with my sister and her husband last night.  It was about 6pm and the place was pretty dead.  The place has a pretty decent vibe to it but isn't nearly as eclectic as I had expected for some reason.  I don't know why, but I had visions of this place looking like some Cheech and Chong movie with tie die everywhere.  The beer selection is decent and have tons to choose from both in bottles and on draft.  There is something there for everyone and they are glad to let you sample anything on draft.  I'm a traditional pizza type of guy so I wasn't sure I was going to like Mellow Mushroom's unconventional pizza offerings.  But I have an open mind and you can't put too much weird sh*t on a pizza, right?  While their specialty pizzas are most unique and contain at least what looks to be fresh ingredients, they don't offer much in the way of taste.  I was expecting to be wowed with the great looking crust and flavorful toppings, but I just wasn't.  The crust was too doughy for me (perfectly crispy on the outside however), but the flavor just wasn't there.  They put some type of coating on it and it looks awesome but isn't flavorful at all.  I tried 4 different pizzas and they were all just ok.  They look and sound way better than they taste.  They didn't taste bad, just not awesome.  I mean you are paying \"gourmet\" pizza prices so I wanted gourmet pizza taste.  Our waitress was awesome.  She was very personable, friendly and fast.  Even if it is a chain I think this place is unique and a great addition to Mill.  However, I'm not entirely sure this place is going to last.  I don't know if college kids (or me for that matter) want to shell out over $30 for a medium pizza and a beer or two.    Pro Tip:  the slices are huge so have them double cut for better sharing.",

But she would disappear 15 minutes at a time. I don't think I've ever waited that long for a water. Then it took another 30 minutes to get my appetizer. I didn't order anything else because I wanted to get out of there before midnight.   Then the food was ok. I unfortunately didn't get the chance to try the pizza. I only got a pretzel appetizer - which basically tasted like salt. My friends seemed to enjoy their meals more than I.   The only reason that I would return here soon is after a night of drinking on Mill. Maybe I'll try it again in 3 months once things get better established, at which point I will hopefully have the opportunity to revise this review.",

    "text": "I sent this review through the Mellow Mushroom website as well, and to my amazement, the next morning I had an email from the owner and a voicemail from the general manager. Both expressed their deepest apologies for what happened to my parents at the Tempe location. The owner, Jay, even asked for my parents address so that he might send a formal apology and refund them their bill. I spoke with Drew, the general manager on the phone and he assured me that he had begun retraining that very same day with regards to cross-contamination and food allergies.  It's people like this that restore my faith in the food industry. Thank you so much for your efforts to remedy this situation and prevent future problems. I look forward to one day trying out your restaurant again.",

We got the mixed green salad, and it was OK for the price, but not terribly good.  We also got the portobella mushroom which was also OK, but not fantastic and would have been incredibly expensive outside of happy hour.  Finally, we got a veggie pizza which was also just OK.  All in all, 3 stars or \"A-OK\".  I would have probably been disappointed if I had gone during non-happy hour, though.",

    "text": "I've finally gotten around to writing a review of this.  This is for the two times I've been to this particular restaurant, though I've been to other Mellows across the country.  To sum it up - the pizza is still just as good as it was at every other Mellow I've been to.  There's a great variety of specialty pizzas and really the dough is what you come here for.  The crust is fantastic - crunchy and dusted lightly with parm, but still soft and doughy on the inside.  This is really the huge selling point.  Price point is a little high but if you only go once every now and then you can stomach it.  Huge draft beer selection, ~$5-7/pint.    The reason why I'm not giving this place a full 5 buckos is that the service just really isn't great at all.  Last time I went on a Wednesday night in the middle of February and the service was god awful slow.  The next time I went it was a Monday night right before ASU was back in session.  Service was again curt and slow.  I guess I shouldn't be too surprised by this considering that it IS in a college town and likely a lot of the waiters are college students and either a) don't care, or b) are weeded because they have too many tables.  That having been said, I certainly don't come here for the ambience and service, and certainly would avoid the place all together on weekends.    Seeing as how it's on Mill Ave, your parking options are meters on the street or there is a close parking garage off Ash (Mellow does validate the ticket so it's free).",

Hates giving out shots to groups for birthdays and has consistently had a bad attitude about doing his job. As a bartender its your job to serve the public and to do so without making patrons feel badly about the establishment. Tonight he messed up several tabs and gave attitude to those of us that didn't want to pay for drinks we didn't order. When confronted about the issue he ended up starting a fight with a friend of mine. I get that drunk people act disorderly but this guy has no respect for his job and is a deterrent to our group because he acts above his job.  Long story short don't tip Nate and try to order drinks from the other bartenders this guy is an ass.",

Mellow is a bad name considering the location is where the old Z- Gallery was on Mill - warehouse style, exposed brick and tall ceilings, very bright lighting and slick laminate flooring. Not a place to break out the incense. (Perhaps the original locale was or some of the other franchises are, but this is not)  Lunch: small Greek style salad, toasted bread thing and soda - decent, good value Dinner: Portobello mushroom sandwich with red pepper, feta and sprouts - GROSS! It was so bad, I had maybe 2 bites before I threw in the towel - which is very rare for me I assure you, I am a notorious plate clearer, whether I am full or not. The mushroom was meely, gritty (not washed?) and very bitter and the toppings flavor didn't blend with the rest of the sandwich.  I tried my husbands medium wings -  they were slimy and luke warm at best when they were delivered. My friends got the cheese pizza and they were unimpressed by it. Maybe we just were there on an off night, but after our last visit I won't make the mistake of going again.",

Their toasted Subs are just ok, and thier deserts are pretty \"Cookie Cutter\"  Service is hit or miss, it seems like one course or aspect of my meal always goes wrong. if its not the app, its the dessert, if its not the wait on a pizza, its the wait on a drink. I think the pizza makes up for the service issues.  MIghty Meaaty is the way to go, or try the Egg and Panchetta.

    "text": "Wow. Two stars because the food is always delicious but what the hell has happened to the service?  I wasn't even going to write this review because I asked for the manager (Aaron, great guy) and his empathy blew my mind.   1. My two male friends arrived at 7:30 on Thursday night and asked the host for a table for 4, she seated them outside on the patio and said \"your server will be right with you.\"  2. My bf and I arrive 5 minutes later and walk into the restaurant hoping the host would be there to take us to our friends. Truth be told, the only person in a mellow t-shirt that was visible was the bartender. Mildly disappointing but we spotted our friends on the patio and decided to seat ourselves.  3. We get outside at 7:37 pm. We sit down, look at the menu and I ask if anyone has come by yet because I'm super thirsty. Turns out the answer is no but there are two different servers bringing the other tables food, drinks and service.  4. Around 7:45 the server helping the adjacent table looks over at the four of us so we're hopeful that she's either going to come over and say \"hey I'm your server\" or \"I'm sorry you've been sitting there for 15 minutes, let me see what happened with YOUR server\" but no, nothing. I've had several jobs in the service industry, many of them while I was an overstrained bitch in college, but I never let a table sit with menus in front of them with no drinks for more than 10 minutes, even if the table wasn't mine. I must've been silly for wanting to make sure the place I worked made money from happy customers, not from customers  who's bill you almost had to comp because your incapable staff screwed up repeatedly, without remorse to add. (shout out to Aaron the manager again, you give me hope for the service industry, unlike the people you work with)  5. At this point, I'm slightly irritated but willing to go find the hostess to see if we can get her to grab our server.  6. It's now 7:52, I checked my phone while waiting for the blonde hostess to get back to her hostess stand. 7:54, she sees me and one other couple waiting and slowly (seriously, i've seen people on ketamine move faster) walks back to her stand and addresses the couple first (not a huge deal).  7. 7:55: Blondie is back but has no idea what I'm talking about, \"what table are you talking about? Who?\" me-\"my two male friends sitting outside that YOU seated twenty-five minutes ago and my boyfriend, dude in the hat facing the street.\" her-\"can you like point it out to me, I'm not sure who you're talking about\" mind you, the patio and my table are completely visible, due to the GIANT WINDOWS. I digress...  8. I get her to follow me outside, where I point to our table and make sure she sees who I'm talking about. \"oh, you got here 25 minutes ago? I'll send someone over\"  9. 8:02, a male server, who I haven't seen at all, comes out and says something along the lines of, \"I'm sorry guys (please, I'm not a guy, learn some manners) you've been waiting here for too long, blah blah blah something about miscommunication, what can I get you to drink?\" My friend is pissed because the last time we went to Mellow, they screwed up his order and our other friends order as well and he doesn't understand why we keep coming back. He orders water because he refuses to give them any sort of business. At this point, I get it. The server then asks if we're ready to order food, really? We've been sitting here for 30 minutes staring at the menu, yes, we're ready.   10. We order the Tye Dye pizza, sans tomato & cucumber with a half order of salt & butter pretzels (hoping those come before the meal as we're starving and thirsty). My friend orders a small Tye Dye, sans mozzarella with vegan cheese added.   11. Our drinks come out a few minutes after that, probably around 8:10 at this point. Our pizzas follow, about 15 minutes after that so, 8:25.   12. Since our friend is only drinking water, we feel bad and eat quickly. Did I mention the pretzels haven't come out yet?  13. We've finished our pizza, the pretzels come out at 8:40, we get our servers attention and ask for a to-go box for the pretzels and pizza, and the check.  14. At this point, since they screwed up pretty badly, I'm expecting that someone has the decency to knock off maybe my beer (our bill was 58 total, before I spoke to Aaron) but no, everything is on there, including the pretzels. The pretzels that came after we were done eating.  15. I look at the check and ask to speak to manager immediately. About 5 minutes later, Aaron walks out, looking pretty upset and distressed (we've all been there).  16. I preface everything with the fact that I've been coming to Mellow for a long time, my love for their pizza started in North Carolina a few years ago and I'm going to keep coming back. He's extremely sympathetic and thanks me for being patient. We get $10 knocked off our bill and two $5 coupons in hopes that we will return. I will, but probably only for take out. Damn.",

When Alex came back he told us that the manager told him \"thats how we always do it. you are paying the same price as the 12oz so don't worry about it.\" That is not ok. That constitutes fraud and if i would have only paid for half of the pizza because that was all we ate, would they have been ok with that? My son was more upset about this than i was and has vowed never to return with his friends. I will not be back either. Next time you order a beer, make sure you get what you ask for.",

Besides the joke on scammig consumers, the variety of chips offered is actually just one and though the menu says choice of sweet or unsweetened ice tea, they only have unsweet. Asked about specials and told there weren't any, back of the menu did have lunch specials. The dude claimed that being the host was why he didn't know and shrugged it off. Manager claims this sign just said \"Happy Pie Day\", might want to pay more attention to what your employees are scribbling on the sign when they tell customers its an \"inside joke\".",

For those of us 21 and up, we were just glad to be relaxing with a pretty massive selection of craft beers to try out. I don't remember what it's called, but there's a particular craft beer that tastes like an orange creamsicle -- that is definitely the one I would recommend! It's a local craft beer. I'm sure if you asked the bartender, they'll know which one.   They also have lots of fun happy hours. I'll definitely be back. The staff seemed pretty nice!",

The bartender literally gave me my first legal alcoholic beverage on my 21st bday, but tonight was just sad. Finished a long shift bartending at my own place, sat at the bar, ordered a shot and a whole order of jerk wings. After the wings were dropped I had no contact with any of the staff for around 30 minutes at which point I was long finished with the wings and dying for just a simple glass of water (those wings aren't exactly mild). Once I was one of the final guests left (on a night where I overheard one of the bartenders say it was a slow night), I was finally able to order a beer and cash out. Seemed like the staff was more interested in going home asap than doing the bare minimum of their job description and serving a customer water. If someone would have just checked up every once in a while I would have order at least another 2 drinks which would mean a higher tip and more sales, as someone who works in the same exact industry I consider my expectations to be lower than the average person but the effort clearly wasn't there tonight...very disappointed...",

    "text": "Our son C is an actor and he had just finished a run of a play he was in. It was Saturday night and we were looking for a place to eat but it was close to 10pm. We had visited the Ahwatukee location of Mellow Mushroom a couple times prior so we headed over hoping to grab some pizza. We arrived a little after 10. The hostess took us back but as we entered the dining / bar area she told us that she was only seating guests in the bar. The dining area was closed. Mellow Mushroom is open until 2am. Why is the dining room being closed 4 hours before the restaurant? Plus, we have been to the Ahwatukee location twice before, at around the same time, with no problems. Since C was with us, sitting in the bar area was not an option. We opted to leave. Once back in the car, I was trying to figure where to go to when K decided to call the Tempe location. She figured they were pretty close and maybe they kept the dining room open longer. The person K spoke with on the phone was very nice and informed K that indeed, the dining room was open and that the restaurant was open until 2am. So, we headed over. Now parking in and around Mill Ave. can be tricky. There is parking in the Chase garage which Mellow Mushroom will validate. We were lucky enough however to find a spot almost right in front. Boooyaa. As we entered the restaurant we were greeted by who I would call a bouncer for lack of a better term. I get it, we're in a college town but seeing the bouncer sitting on a stool by the host stand seemed a bit odd for a restaurant. A bar, sure, but Mellow Mushroom does not present itself as a bar / restaurant in my opinion but a restaurant with a bar inside. Regardless, the gentleman was very pleasant and he asked to see K's i.d. O.K., now without divulging too much info., suffice it to say that K's birthday year starts with a 6 so being asked for i.d. was a game changer for her. She was on cloud 9. Plus, the guy on the stool was very nice and was actually the first bright light since we started this odyssey. The hostess sat us down and told us our server would be right with us. Our server came by and asked us if we'd been there before. We explained that we had been to the location in Ahwatukee a couple times and in fact had just left there because the dining room was closed. She apologized and left to fill our drink orders. When she returned to drop off our drinks and take our food order, she brought the manager with her. He asked us if there was a problem and we explained the situation we had just had with the Ahwatukee location. He said that closing the dining room was at the discretion of the manager, there was really no set time to do it and he fully understood our position with our 10-year-old son with us. He was very pleasant and very apologetic and said he was glad we gave his restaurant a try and hoped we enjoyed it. Another bright light. K got her sour beer ($6.50) so she was even happier. C & I both just had water. We ordered one large pizza for the 3 of us. I knew this would be plenty. We ordered a large cheese with Italian sausage ($19.38). The pizza arrived and it was bubbly hot with a lot of sausage on it. The crust was nicely browned and not burnt. The crust has a slightly sweet yeasty taste which I like. The sausage was not super spicy hot and works for me. I like Mellow Mushroom pizza. Heck, if we didn't like it we wouldn't go back. Winner winner pizza dinner. Our server was also very pleasant. The whole experience at this location was by far the best of the now 3 times we've been to a Mellow Mushroom. Kudos to the manager whom we spoke with, the server who was very sweet and of course the bouncer (sorry) who actually was a very charming man. Great staff. Very good pizza. Prices a bit high. Clean facility. 4.5 Stars.",

Since it was happy hour, we ordered a couple drinks, which came out to be too artificial and sweet for our table. We decided to order the chicken wings, the stuffed portebello mushroom, and the five guys pizza with five types of mushrooms.  The chicken wings were pretty standard, but a good starter snack. The portebello mushroom came out cold, and we could not enjoy it at all, so we sent it back. What a bummer. The pizza, on the other hand, made up for the appetizers. The thin crust was nice and crisp, and the toppings were fantastic. We really enjoyed the pizza and finished it within minutes.   I would recommend sticking to the pizza and maybe skipping the appetizers if you're not that hungry. Our total came out to be around $45 which was pretty reasonable as we also got drinks.",

For a Friday night, we were surprised they were pretty empty.  We were seated right away and the waitress came to take our order.  They have an extensive selection of beers and we both decided to order one.  They were good although I felt that they could have been a little colder. We decided to start off with a small Enlightened Spinach salad to share. It had fresh spinach topped with chopped apples, dried cherries, and sprinkled with candied pecans and feta cheese. We also chose to add on chicken. The dressing the waitress suggested for it was their signature Esperanza. At first bite it felt like the wrong type of dressing for this type of salad; however, after a few bites the flavors began to meld together and it became quite tasty.  We couldn't decide on which pizza to share so the waitress suggested we do half and half which is what we did.  Our favorite was the Kosmic Karma.  It had a base of red sauce with spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, sliced Roma tomatoes, and finished with both mozzarella and feta cheese. The pesto swirl they finished it with really set it off. For our other half we chose the Funky Q. Chicken. It was covered with BBQ chicken, mozzarella and cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and Applewood smoked bacon then finished with a BBQ sauce swirl. It was good however I felt that the Applewood smoked bacon overpowered the other flavors. Service was fine and the waitress made sure to check on us regularly. Hubby and I agreed that the food was okay but it is not a place we would go out of our way to visit again.",

    "text": "I would love to give this location 5 stars but repeated errors and poor service have dropped my rating. We've been coming here for 3 years and the food is always amazing. Get the Maui waui pizza. It's the best. 3 years ago the service was great, attentive and friendly. Lately it hasn't been that way. Unfortunately our food has been burnt several times or the the bartender has forgotten our food on multiple occasions and we've been served cold food. Isn't there a food runner or a manager watching the expo line to ensure food gets out in a timely manner? Another time we had a server that would come by to check on us, we'd tell her we were ready to order and she promptly walk away. We love the pizzas and pretzels and want to come back more frequently but the service is making us think twice.  Just wanted to update our review. The food is amazing and we really enjoy Alexis. If you're looking for a great pizza or fun selection of beer, this is the place.",

I have to hand it to our server for being patient with us, as we had the kids with us and they were in full naughty mode.  Price-wise, there's better bang for your buck, but kids drinks are free, and that Mellowterranean pizza was worth trying. I'd definitely pay the Mellow Mushroom another visit, next time without the kiddos.",

It was the philosophers that was the let down. It just didn't seem to work and the feta was just too strong.  The service however was great and they have a solid draft beer list as well.

    "text": "Mellow Mushroom - One of the most tight-lipped restaurants I talked to would only admit to the use of soybean oil, which is likely GMO - \"Soybean oil is a major ingredient in our pizzas\" they wrote to me in an email. Furthermore, when I asked about hidden MSG ingredients, they told me that they weren't required to tell me since they are not one of the 7 major allergens designated by the FDA and don't list them on their allergen list. So I decided to go use their allergen tool to see what they do list and found something shocking. The tool gives misleading, inaccurate and potentially dangerous information if you have a soy allergy. For example, I confirmed their crust uses soy, but when you use the tool, it says there are plenty of pizzas without soy. The information doesn't add up and regardless of whether if you have an allergy, I would not trust Mellow Mushroom until they release the full ingredient lists for their menu.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffoodbabe.com%2F2014%2F03%2F23%2Fif-youve-ever-eaten-pizza-before-this-will-blow-your-mind%2F&s=3bea25db03b19e20ee41c0b5137d0d42fbcbec3482efddd2b5fefcf1bf16f8b3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">foodbabe.com/2014/03/23/...</a>",

I thought the pizza was good, but a bit over priced, but they have a very good craft beer selection.  So I gave the one in Tempe a try.  I travel into Phoenix for business fairly regularly and eat at the Mushroom on almost every trip because the bartenders - Ariana and Katie - are friendly and efficient.  Get there before 6 for happy hour specials.  Order a medium pizza or larger and take the leftovers home.  They also have reverse happy hour after 10:00pm.  My favorite pizza is not one of their specials, but is should be: red sauce, spinach, mushrooms and caramelized onions.  They should add it to the menu as it works great with their medium crust",

Mellow Mushroom has delicious food as well as a fun and laid back environment to make a great place for a bite to eat! I am very pleased to say that my experience at Mellow Mushroom was absolutely phenomenal, and I will definitely be paying another visit to taste another slice of their classic pizzas.  Not only is the food great, but the employees are as well! The waiters and waitresses make sure that: you are having an awesome experience, and that you get the food you are craving. The employees are casual, friendly and outgoing which makes the experience more comfortable and laid back for you and your friends. My group of friends and I had a great waitress who recommended a delicious BBQ chicken pizza and also recommended awesome places to visit around Mill Ave while we were there for the night.  The food was more on the expensive side, but the quality definitely matches the price. The great service also made up for the expensiveness, and made it an overall pleasurable experience for me and my group of friends. The vibe in the restaurant matches the vibe of Mill Ave and its lively energy. If you are ever in the Mill Ave area, you should for sure give Mellow Mushroom a try. Trust me, you will be glad you did!",

    "text": "Food-wise, I'm not a huge fan of fancy pizza.  But the pizza here I thought was just alright for the price, I have been to other pizza places that were cheaper and I thought were tastier, though some others with me thought the pizza was very flavorful.  I came with my family on a Thursday night maybe a 1.5 - 2 months back, and it was maybe 25% or less crowded in terms of max capacity.  The main negative per this review is the atmosphere and the acoustics of the building.  There was a noisy and probably drunk group of people on the right side of the building, and we were seated in the middle.  In spite of having a booth row of seats between us and them, the noise level was unbearably loud.  I requested to the waiter that they talk to the group and get them to be quieter, to which he replied that another group or two had said the same thing and they had mentioned it to the group, but if any corrective action was taken, there was no noticable sound change.  Part of it is the acoustics of the building, not muffling/isolating sound to different parts of the restaurant, but seriously, it was so loud that it was incredulously bad, I couldn't believe a restaurant could have this kind of problems in atmosphere (again, in part due to building itself, it seems).  I stuffed napkin in my ears to try and block the sound and it was still very loud.  So it made for a terrible experience as I could not really hold a pleasant conversation with anyone in that environment, and it amounted to waiting for the food to come so I could eat and get out of there.  I'm also a little hard of hearing, which makes the noise problem even worse that I was affected by it as badly as I was.  If going, and there's a hint that the noise could be a problem, I would highly recommend eating outside to avoid noise issues.",

Now I knew right off the bat that our server was a bit light in the brains department, so I tried to talk slowly. We had two cocktails before the food came out. When it did arrive I was bent. This isn't going to fill me up? This is the large? I have been bent for a week wanting to rip this place. But I just looked at the receipt and we were only charged for a regular. So it was the servers fault. On to the sandwich. It was on a crispy roll stuffed with meat and veggies. The chips were homemade and crunchy. I would have appreciated the hoagie I saw on the tube. But it's all good. As I remember how tough it was to breath and stand erect without passing out at that age!",

That being said, unless you are a college student or enjoy people watching, avoid this location on Friday and Saturday nights.  My husband and I were entertained by the drunken antics of a nearby table of college kids but we just laughed it off.  However, being shorted our change by the waitress (no worries I deducted it from her tip) and being forced to wait for plates, a side of ranch dressing, and our bill while she chatted with her friends, is not something we can laugh off.   The pizza was very good.  I'm not used to a whole wheat crust and it was a nice change from the usual.  I thought the sauce was yummy and they didn't skimp on the cheese.    Our experience won't turn us away from all Mellow Mushroom locations, just Mill Ave on Friday and Saturday nights.

It was a Saturday afternoon at about 4:15 and there were maybe 15 people in the  place and was definitely not busy, and there was plenty of staff  6 or so pizza makers , 4-5 servers (I assume they were servers anyway) and a couple hostess and at least 1 manager on duty that I could see not including bar kitchen and bar staff.  OK now the not so good....   I don't think our server worked there ( I say this half jokingly) se showed up at out table to take out order, deliver out drinks, bring us out salad and then bring us our pizza and then to bring us our check.   never ever checking on us to see if we needed anything else ( we had no silverware, there was no salt on the table, to see if we needed any refills on our drinks ) and when she wasn't at our table (which was not very often) I have no idea where she was   she was not where to be seen ( probably why she didn't take as good of care of us as she should have) And I mean no where to be see, no in the pizza making area , not at hostess stand , not at bar, not in any of the other sections, its like she left and came back very strange for a place that wasn't even busy.  ok next the hostesses were by front door talking to each other  ignoring everything else that was going on. The Manager (I assume He was manager he was dressed differently than everyone else and seemed to be giving out orders) seemed more like he was more interested in talking up a couple of different wait staff (female) and being Mr Player and important that he didn't even notice the lack of service we were receiving. Also the fact that The men's restroom trash can was overflowing with paper towels and  the sing was utterly disgusting and that the faucet on the right in the men's bathroom was just sitting on the sink, it was not attached to the sink in any way other than the hoses that supplied water. I washed my hands and kept my paper towel and was going to bring it back to my table rather than throw it on floor in restroom.  on the way back to my table there was a trash can about 7 feet from mr manager man that was completely full to the to that things were sticking over the top but not over flowing  I put the towel in there, I had to be careful or it would have been on the floor there also.  I sat back down and watched this manager talk to a server and then he threw something in the over full trash can.  I was thinking I can't believe he didn't have some one empty the trash.  It was almost overflowing.  a few minutes later one of the servers threw something in the trash, he walked over to the can and looked at it a few times and looked perplexed.  He called her over  I was thinking he was going to have here empty it, instead he asked her why she threw something away , and then she said why, and he and her both walked away from the trash can.   no one emptied it at all.  My lunch date said that the woman's restroom garbage can was not quite overflowing, but apparently the women there aren't as good of shots as the men because there 5-6 towels of floor in there.  and mind you this was around 5 pm on a Saturday afternoon at his time, before they were even busy, I can only imagine how bad it must get when the place gets busy And I can only imagine that if this is the cleanliness that they have in their public, open areas, I don't think I want to know what happens in there not seen areas of prep, and refrigeration, and dishes.  Yuck  I would not recommend this place, not because the pizza wasn't decent, but more because of sanitary concerns and lack of attention to details from the staff from the manager all the way down to the servers,   I know that it all starts at management and I guess if the manager is more concerned with chatting the ladies up then running a restaurant, I guess this is how the details that are most important (cleanliness, customer service, appearance) don't really have time or priority to be taken care of.",

Visiting from out of town, I found Mellow Mushroom an excellent Friday night dinner spot. Although the atmosphere was lively and there were lots of people there, my group of four was seated immediately upon entering. Our server was very personable and ready to answer all of our questions. We started with a spinach/artichoke dip appetizer (very good) and then had a large pepperoni. The pizza was awesome, I could've eaten the entire thing plus 1/2 of another and made myself sick, and this would've been worth it, but I had the rest of the group to consider.  There's a nice ambience in Mellow Mushroom. There are TVs, but they don't dominate the space. This is my optimal TV condition for casual dining. Furthermore, during my visit, the place had seemed to attract various groups of Arizona's most attractive hipster women, which is a condition that needs its own box on Yelp akin to price and parking.",

I think my issue with this place is their non-pizza food items. First time I ate there, got the Caesar salad - definitely not what I was expecting and I was not a fan. Also ordered the \"soft\" pretzel with salt - never again. Holy salt and hold the soft. The next time I ate there, I got the spinach artichoke dip, which was tasty while hot, but if you decide to not gobble it down, the texture gets kinda funky as it cools. Also ordered the Capri - mozzarella, basil and balsamic. Probably my favorite non-pizza item but it was still lacking something - more balsamic or some crackers... Idk. All in all... I will be back at least for drinks and happy hour. Jury is still out on the food.",

I ordered a \"build your own\" salad to start with spinach, broccoli, tomatoes, and tofu with herb vinaigrette. The BBQ tofu was not well marinated but it still tasted BBQ-ish.   We ordered the Mega veggie pizza, and asked for 100% daiya cheese on it, but it came out with only my half with Daiya because I said I was vegan. Disappointing for my boyfriend who now prefers Daiya over real cheese. Otherwise, the pizza was *fantastic*! The crust was nice and crispy all the way through, absolutely no sogginess. A generous amount of cheese too. I brought the manager over to thank him for having so many vegan options available! Sandwiches with tempeh, calzones with tofu and vegan cheese.... just so many wonderful things to choose from besides lame ass cheeseless pizza.   I will definitely return. The beer list is INSANE!",

I have to say i've never had a bad item on their menu, even the non meat items are delicious and i'm a meat eater thru and thru.  Its a great place to take everyone in the family, you can get single pizza's or huge pizza pie's you can share. They even have salads!! The service could be a little better but i don't really expect much as their mostly college kids working there meaning you get what you pay for. The service at the bar is great just haven't had great service in the dining area.They can accommodate huge groups parties and there are plenty of TV's in the bar area to watch the game and grab a beer w friends.

    "text": "I'll start by saying I really wanted to like this place because the beer selection had me giddy and the food was definitely decent, albeit kind of expensive for the ASU neighborhood. The pizza was better than the rest of what I sampled from the menu but unfortunately, the service was horrendous.  We went towards the end of a celebration involving beer that the town was having and it was Saturday night so we expected it to be on the busier side. The bar area was loud thanks to an excessively high music volume (I promise I'm not just old and grumpy) and people getting their buzz on. It was a little disorienting and it didn't allow my friends and I to carry on a conversation, but it's not a big deal. It's a college bar/restaurant, after all. The servers, as well as the bartender (who seemed to be serving and talking with the same few people, getting them one drink after another, while neglecting everyone else), were clearly inattentive and probably overworked. It looked to me like everyone had too much on their plates and none of them seemed to be on top of things. They were too laid back (read: spacey) or too exhausted to take on the steady stream of customers coming in after us as well as keeping up with existing customers. Another employee (preferably an alert one) thrown into the mix would have made a world of difference, After not seeing our server around for awhile, I made the mistake of ordering a beer with the guy who brought us our food. I passed him my ID to take a look at, watched him jot my drink order down, and to my dismay, he was never to be seen again. Wait, I take that back. I was just reminded that we saw him again when he was hanging out and chatting with friends outside. What a coincidence that he was ready to go back inside (in a hurry) just as we made eye contact while leaving the restaurant! When our waitress did eventually come around to see if we were ready for the check, I mentioned my long lost beer and she confessed she hadn't received word of it but was not apologetic, which would have improved the situation for me. It took a bit longer but I received my beer and my check, which of course is a disconcerting combination when I had initially wanted said beer just moments after ordering our food. I drank it quickly in an effort to make our way out of the place in a timely manner but regretted not getting to savor it happily with my meal. Another thing I want to mention (with has absolutely nothing to do with the restaurant's service or the food) is the fact that their water is not purified. This is a non-issue for me in Albuquerque but the tap water in Phoenix tastes remarkably like pond scum to non-Natives such as myself who are well adjusted to better quality water from the tap. I think making an effort to provide customers who are drinking and need to stay hydrated with clean, filtered water free of charge would give businesses an edge in AZ.  Overall, I think this restaurant is being managed poorly but has potential. I wish the employees were a bit more keen on doing their job because I'm sure they're all nice people who I'd like to say sweet things about. I'm not sure if it's a chain, I'm assuming it is, but If they opened one here and it wasn't understaffed, I could potentially frequent it based on the beer selection alone.",

She took a while just to get my water and when she was taking my order she got distracted by a couple of her \"friends\" who were walking past the restaurant. She called out to them and started up a conversation with me just sitting there waiting for her to take my order.  After five minutes of this nonsense, I decided I had enough. I firmly reminded her that I was a customer and since she was on the clock, I was to be her priority. Her friends walked away, giving me the evil eye. She rolled her eyes at me and proceeded to take my order. I ordered two slices of pepperoni pizza. After 40 minutes she came back with a vegetarian pizza. i calmly pointed out that she had gotten my order wrong and she disappeared for another 20 minutes. Another waitress came out and apologized for the bad service, asking me if I wanted to wait a little longer for my lunch. I said no and left the Mellow Mushroom.  No sooner had I exited the door I was practically cornered by some homeless booze hound. He wanted spare change, reasoning that since I was \"rich enough\" to eat here, I should be able to be able to spare him a little money.

    "text": "The bad just keeps getting worse.  My previous review for Mellow Mushroom garnered two of five stars; they've officially been downgraded.  Today was my third and final visit to the the Mushroom.  Having been several months since visiting, and with my initial two visits occurring very near to their opening, I thought to give them one last shot.  Entered at what I would consider a peak lunch time (between noon and 1pm) and it was actually quite dead.  There was a managerial type person standing near the podium that was engrossed in their cell-phone.  At our approach, they quickly stepped out of the way and a hostess stepped in to greet and seat us.  Okay thus far (still don't care for their retro, 80's, skater decor -- it seems really contrived).    Server was friendly enough.  She took our order and brought us our drinks (waters, all around).  The food took quite some time to arrive; it was explained at one point that they were waiting on my 10\" pizza.  Fair enough.  Somewhere in here, I tired quickly of the tap-water offering and asked instead for a Diet Coke.    The food finally arrived and everything *looked* okay.  I ordered five jerk chicken wings, well done and a pepperoni and sausage pizza.  My friend ordered what was supposed to be a chicken club \"hoagie\", however it arrived on thickly sliced bread (i.e., not a hoagie).  First thing I tried was the chicken wings.  They were seasoned nicely and cooked well enough, however they had *obviously* been cooked well in advance of the pizza as they were room-temperature to cold.  I made it through two of them before setting them aside.    About this time, my friend noted that her sandwich was incredibly dry -- so much so that the crust on the bread was almost \"sharp\" and causing a scratching sensation when eating.  She also noted that it was quite bland and possibly \"the worst sandwich I've ever had\".    The pizza was sufferable, if not overly cheesy.  It was obvious that little care had gone into the making of the pizza, as the toppings were strewn mostly to one side of the pie, leaving one half to be mostly cheese and... well, cheese.  At this point, I asked for a box to take the remainder of the pizza home and requested that the wings be removed from our bill as they had clearly been fired too early and were not acceptable.  The server looked at me critically, stating that she would see what she could do, at which time I informed her that if she can't do anything about it, to please send her manager over so that I can resolve it with them.  Needless to say, the wings were removed.  If it's any indication as to how bad the food here is, I didn't even finish a single glass of Diet Coke -- even it had a foul taint to it.   We left feeling anything but Mellow.",

So even if you don't like the pizza (which is borderline impossible, shit's great) you can get hammered 105 different ways and forget you ate it.  Now, I will say its a bit pricey on the food front. A large ranges anywhere from $16 to $26, but it is quite delicious so I put up with it. They also have hoagies and crazy salads. I recommend the BBQ or Buffalo Chicken pizza, by the way. I get the BBQ to the point that the bartenders (who are all lovely) make fun of me when I order otherwise. Or don't drink. What just because I'm usually drunk I gotta drink every time I'm in here?

    "text": "Who knew such a cool place existed on Mill? I went here for a Sunday lunch with a friend after hearing decent reviews from another firend who had gone here for happy hour and apps. Their menu and review boosted of the best pizza in Arizona so I was intrigued. We ordered a half buffalo chicken half BBQ chicken medium pizza for the two of us and it was fantastic.  Huge pieces, so a medium was more than enough. The crust was like nothing I've had before as it was made of like a wheat dough, drizzled with a garlic sauce perhaps. The chicken was done well on both halves and neither were swimming in the sauce. I'm not a carmelized onion fan but they were on the BBQ chicken side and I actually enjoyed them. Not slimy or overwhleming, but pretty complimentary of the sauce.   The atmosphere was pretty cool too. I didn't understand the idea behind the mushroom thing and was a bit turned off because I'm grossed out by fungi, but they pulled it off in a cool, funky, non-fungi type of way. The waitress was super sweet too and let us know all about their awesome pizzas. I would totally go back here.",

    "text": "Absolutely the best pizza that I have had! I have heard a few folks say that it is pricey, really? Well let's see it has REAL mozzarella cheese and the best crust around - the only pizza that I like to eat backwards!   I was greeted with a smile from the hostess and set at a clean table, offered a drink right away. Yes, the pizza takes a bit longer than 5 minutes, but it is so worth the wait.(with that being said, it still was not longer than 20 minutes - during lunch rush) There is one more thing that I noticed about this dining establishment  ---- the ice tea! It is a dead giveaway to me when a restaurant is below the standards of what I like and that is the ice tea - I know snobby right, but still there is nothing like eating great food only to be ruined by the bitter taste of day old tea - but not here! The tea was fresh and tasty just like everything else on the menu. When my friends and I were eating we had not only the server check on us but the manager Ryan would come by to see if we needed anything!!!  ** I was so impressed by Mellow Mushroom that I bought a couple of the Shirts. I highly recommended that you go see for yourself, you will not be disappointed! **",

    "text": "Met a friend for lunch at the Mellow Mushroom on Mill Ave.  Got there around 11:45, and we were the first there for lunch.  Ordered small spinach salad, which was very interesting w candied pecans, fresh spinach, feta, apples - very good, except the dressing tasted old. My friend ordered the gluten free pizza which was ok,nothing special, crust was chewy. Took over an hour to be served! Waiter was quite nice and kept apologizing - almost felt sorry for him.  Thought  the meal was only ok, and quite expensive.",

    "text": "Mellow Mushroom never disappoints. Even when they are super busy, you never sit up front long. Ever time I have gone, I have been seated almost immediately. Yes, sometimes it takes a while for the food to come, but I would so much rather be at a table having a conversation and drinking my drink than standing or sitting in the lobby or outside.   The employees are always super nice, which can only mean one thing: they like their jobs! Mellow Mushroom must take good care of their people to have so many nice, happy employees. Maybe they enjoy their jobs so much because of the fun location on Mill Ave- a college, single and ready to mingle area.  Finally, the pizza is delicious! I love the pizza with the Caesar salad on top. Sometimes I will get a small pizza for myself and do half one kind and half another. I like having options!  You will leave Mellow Mushroom a happy person!",
