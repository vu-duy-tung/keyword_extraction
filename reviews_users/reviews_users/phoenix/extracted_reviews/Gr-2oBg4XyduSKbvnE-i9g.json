We had arrived just after they opened on a sunday there was no rush or reason I think the waitress clearly forgot to add the steak to the meal when putting in the order. Overall the food was delicious I would definitely recommend salt and lime to all my friends.",

The food was fantastic! Our server was PHENOMENAL! I do not even like tequila, and he recommended something to try and I  even liked it!   Being able to order tacos a la carte is such a great way to try all the different ones! Pork belly is my favorite!   The atmosphere is really cool vibe as well!  Get a bunch of friends together and check it out!",

    "text": "My wife and I ate here for the first time.  We had a coupon for $5 off for spending $20 or more.  We both like Mexican food so we decided to give it a try.  I ordered the carnitas.  It was a bunch of pulled beef on a bed of green chili salsa with red onions on top.  It was overly salty to the extent that I couldn't eat it.  It was like eating beef where the only spice is salt.  My wife tried it and agreed.  Perhaps it's supposed to be very salty because the place is called \"Salt & Lime.\"  Anyway, I told the waiter and he said he'd tell the cook.  No offer to get me something else or anything.  When the meal was over, the waiter asked how it was and I said I can't eat it because it's overly salty.  At that point he said he'd take it off our bill and asked me if I wanted anything else to eat.  By that time I'd already filled up on the flour tortillas and chips.  So I declined.  Anyway, my wife had already finished eating at this point and it's not practical to wait for another meal when we're basically done.  She should have offered at the start of the meal.  The funny thing is that when we finished eating, my wife said her burrito (had shrimp in it) was also very salty.  Salt seems to be their seasoning of choice.  I would have rated the restaurant 1 star, but since they didn't make me pay for a lightly eaten salty carnitas, I've bumped it up to 2 stars.  There's no chance we'll ever come back here to eat again.",

I first had a strawberry jalapeno margarita. There was no kick to it and the strawberry tasted very imitation. I decided to try the house margarita. It wasn't any better. I could taste the Soda water. It's a shame because I love a good margarita- especially when there is great food to go with it! I would go back for the food and probably just get a beer.",

She was the only waitress working and apparently she was not interested in working.  After sitting there for about 20 minutes the bartender finally came over and took our order and dropped chips (no water, no drinks). We finally got water after another 15 minutes but our orange juices took even longer. We were literally there 45 minutes before our OJ hit the table. We were contemplating leaving just seconds before.  Bartender was a friendly gentleman but he was overwhelmed or not very organized... Or a little of both.  When the food came it was ok. Not memorable, just ok and not bad. We had the breakfast burrito which someone at our table said it tasted like Taco Bell but with more potatoes. Another guest said his tortilla egg thing was soggy like it was under heat lamps for a bit. In short, it was a train wreck. I even had to waive down someone to pay the bill.  I will not return and don't recommend anything about the place. Staff never smiled, ignored our table and wasn't doing a very good job with the other tables either. Especially considering the place only had like 5 tables (less than 1/4 full).  No heart, No passion.",

The server asked if we wanted the Slaw; hey wait a minute, it comes with the entree; we also chose the RED SAUCE; BIG mistake. The sauce was poured over and was BITTER. I had to scrap all the red sauce to the side of my plate. My wife also agreed that it wasn't good. Looking at the menu now, I don't remember if my burrito had the guacamole and pico de gallo in it. The carnitas, itself, was moist and  cooked just right. The Jicama Mango Slaw was very refreshing while eating the burrito.  The next time we try this restaurant I'm going to try their tacos and margarita. It looks like the name of the restaurant lives up to its billing, I just wish the burritos would have  been mucho better.",

We loved the decor, it's smaller than I expected but the atmosphere is great! We started off with guacamole and I liked it, but felt Id was a tad too chunky. I had a little trouble deciding what to order, wasn't sure if I wanted fajitas, a veggie burrito, or tacos. It was happy hour and you get a dollar off tacos which is awesome so I went for the tacos!  I got one vegetable taco that had a bunch of different veggies on it, and another taco that was fried avocado with mango slaw on it. The veggie one was my favorite, the avocado one was only ok, I just thought the flavors didn't work together for me. Also I would've preferred the tortillas to be a tad crispy, but that's just my personal preference! I ordered black beans as a side as well and they were good! Put some on my veggie taco. I think next time I'll give the veggie burrito a try, but overall I was happy!",

The first time we went for happy hour, our waitress was extremely happy and helpful. When we asked about the drinks, she offered her favorites and discussed the different liquor \"floats\" we could add. I opted for the shop special which is the house margarita on the rocks. My husband went with the casarita which is the house margarita but frozen. We both tried blackberry as a float but my favorite is the prickly pear. Since then, these have pretty much our go to drinks.   As for appetizers, we have tried the guacamole, the chili relleno with shrimp, the nachos, and the quesadilla. The chili relleno is definitely our favorite as we've ordered it several times.  For entrees, I love the tacos. They have a wide variety and two are plenty (especially after some appetizers). My favorite tacos are the pork belly and the barbacoa. My husband has tried their green chili chicken enchiladas and their carne asada burrito. The burrito was delicious and he's ordered it a few times. But really, the tacos are the main attraction for us. For dessert, we've tried their churros once and my husband liked them, but I wasn't that keen on them.   Every time we've been the service has been quick and friendly. This is our go-to Mexican restaurant and I'd highly recommend stopping by and checking them out!",

The so called chili relanjano was plopped with a bunch of so called carnita on top of an under done pablano pepper and it was cold. Our waiter Ron was great but their idea of a celebration of an anniversary and fiesta left a lot to be desired. I have been here several times now. Very inconsistent and the employees are a revolving door. Not to mention the manager kept interviewing newbies while we were there. Not sure I'll ever be back. They're not cheap",

    "text": "This is a nice new watering hole for the area, which serves some Mexican inspired pub grub.   We came for Happy Hour around 5 on a Saturday afternoon. Granted, it was probably unfair of us to come here after last week's foodie extravagance at Gallo Bianco in Phoenix.  But we found the food good and the drinks cold, always a plus.   The atmosphere is a cross between a sports bar and a Mexican beach cantina. They have a large bar area which extends out onto the sidewalk. You can sit on bar stools outside, on a ceramic window area and still see the game on their two HDTVs inside.   Salt and Lime is a bar where Dos Equis Lager, Corona Light or Modelo Dark are on tap for $4.00 and come in a pint glass, while their small wine list was $7 a glass. Salt & Lime doesn't carry or serve Sangria. They also had several margaritas on the menu starting at $6 and going up from there.   The food was good and what you would expect. We started with Guacamole for $5.50 (photo) and shared an order of Nachos ($8.50).  The guacamole had some mango through it, which made it interesting; while the nachos were drizzled with several different types of cheeses. Not bad for bar food.   Since these appetizers were filling, we ordered some Empanadas ($5.25) and a couple of Tacos for $3.25 each. The empanadas came with shredded chicken(photo) but were overly doughy and had a flour after-taste. The Carne Asada tacos were good, but admittedly we were spoiled from last week's adventure at Gallo.   The bill came to $42.75 plus taxes and gratuities, so expect to pay $27 each unless you're very thirsty. LOL.   We found Salt & Lime Three Stars, A-Okay",

So, we are a tough group... luckily for all locals restaurants we don't get together much.  S&L did great! There was only one plate sent back and the server was very gracious about it!  The food tasted great. Here is what we ordered: An array of 4 different types of tacos Veggie Taco 2 Salmon salads 1 tostado salad Guac and chips Ceviche   The guac was a little small and my personal preference is that there is more avocado than stuff in it... and I felt it was light on the avocado. Others at the table enjoyed it.   Also the salads were a bit over dressed, a little soggy by the end. But the dressings tasted delicious!   I'll be back!!",

Both my mom and husband didn't like any of the tacos they ordered. The flavor and temperature of the tacos was off.

I've been there several times, and the wait staff is always super friendly. The fajitas are wonderful, especially if you have a huge appetite.  They're also a fun entree to share, and they have ample amounts of toppings on the side. For a smaller appetite, the tacos can be ordered individually, and they are fresh, authentic, and fabulous!  I had the carne asada taco (pictured here), and the strips of steak were so tender and flavorful. To make it more of a meal, the waitress suggested a side of beans, and she was right; they were perfect together. Even though I was completely full, I still could've eaten another one of those tacos; they were THAT good.  I will definitely remember that the next time.",

    "text": "I have taken my family to this new restaurant twice.  Oddly, dining options for Mexican food in this area are rather light.  There is a Chipotle by the hospital (block away) and the more traditional Ajo Al's and Miguels about half a mile away.  Those two restaurants are OK, but serve a traditional 'American' mexican food style dish - which, just seems old and tired.   We ate here with two adults and two kids.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and comfortable, if not a little crowded.  There is a very fun looking bar area and patio (but we sat in the dining area).  We saw many people having cocktails and wine at the bar, which is not normally what you would see at a Mexican place, but, it tells you right off the bat that this is not traditional mexican where you either get a margarita or beer.    I am melding my two experiences together to give you a better sense.  We tried:  Casarita - their house slushy margarita, which comes from a machine and tastes great. I had a floater of \"prickly pear\" liquor in it.  I had two, and got my buzz on well.  After I had two the waiter mentioned its a limit of 4 because they have a lot of booze in there.  Shop Special - this is a regular margarita on the rocks.  Seemed good, not sour or tart.  Watermelon Fresca - they make this with booze, or without (I had the booze one).  Holy cow this is a strong drink.  Its water based, with chunks of watermelon - NOT a sweet candy drink.  more like infused water.  Interesting..... and strong..... and happy hour prices :-).  I have never had a cocktail like this.... it felt... healthy in a way.  The food has some goods, and some medicare's.  Chips and salsa is different - they tell you the first salsa is free.  One night we tried the medium pineapple salsa.  The salsa is not like the kind you get from the store.  It looks hand chopped, and is not full of liquid.  My kids loved this, but it seemed as mild as mild could be on the heat index.  The second time we were there, we tried the Tomatillo, which is supposed to be Hot, but to me was medium.  You have had hotter salsa, trust me.  I am not sure if you can tell them to kick it up a bit.  We went through two things of chips, and the one salsa lasted, but it doesn't feel the same without that endless bowl of tomato salsa - I guess I am a purest on that.  The menu is arranged almost like a mexican eatery - there are some full meals, but most feels like a la cart that you are building into a meal.  For instance, my wife and I each had two tacos that ranged in price from $4-6 each, and a side of beans $2.50 and a side of cilantro rice $3.  The total price of the meal was about the same as  you would expect if it was all put together for you.    The taco's are quite large and stuffed, and pretty creative.  We had (over two visits):  A baja taco (not sure if this is the name) - it has a MASSIVE chunk of beer battered fish in it.  We ordered this twice because it was a huge value for money.  An El Pastor taco - ehhhhh, was fatty or something.  I was thinking it was something different (but I ate it).  A veggie taco (not sure of the name) - now this was excellent.  Usually the vegetarian dish is half assed in mexican places.  This was portabella mushrooms and stuffed, and seasoned really well.  I would do this again in a heartbeat.  A Barbacoa taco - yummy, can't go wrong  A Shrimp taco - also very good.  My kids ate off the kids menu.  A quesadilla and bean burrito.  The bean burrito was the best ever.  and it was really large for a kid menu.  If you don't know what to order, get this item (its on adult menu), you will thank me.  Its not like any bean burrito you have ever had.  My wife took the second half to lunch the next day.  The kids were dismayed by \"yucca\" fries on the kid menu, which I thought was a kind of potato or something, but they were sweet potato fries (which the kids hate) so there ya go!  The sides we tried a bunch because they seemed cheap:  Cilantro rice.  Really yummy - its bright green, and very well done.  Could eat this by itself.  Two kinds of beans - don't remember the names.  Both very good - well seasoned.  I am not a bean person, but these I could eat over and over (they are not refried).  corn (which comes out as corn on the cob), on a skewer already buttered.  Apparently we were there on the first week, because there were some hiccups in the wait staff.  Our child's food apparently had not been ordered, and we are the type of family that doesn't eat until its all on the table.  The owner apologized profusely and brought out a free desert - it was a churro, but wasn't perfect or straight like the Disneyland kind.  Everyone said they didn't want it, until we tried it.  A fresh made churro is mind boggling good.  I have never seen a desert like that on any menu, and it was so flipping yummy.  It came with this lemon creme dipping sauce.  I can't explain how interesting this was.  Its different, but not crazy different.  We will be back.",

Bartender salted the rim like a Chicago driveway in a deep freeze, yuck.  The beer price for happy hour was $4 which is a much better option than the margarita.  Still for happy hour the prices were high.  Location is also a tough spot. The bartender was nice and social, doubt I'd give this place another shot.",

The pork belly taco is very good, although I wish the meat was cut thicker.  Chicken mole taco, one of the best I've had...ended up ordering another one. Now the Taco al pastor...stay away! Much too sweet.  The tacos are not your typical street tacos, they are much larger.  The chips were fresh, and above average. I enjoyed the house salsa but if you want to add some kick get the habanero salsa.  House margaritas weren't overly sweet, and the servers were attentive.  We will be back.",

The pork belly taco was similarly flat, although the ingredients were clearly fresh. Nothing in terms of quantity or quality to justify the $5 per taco. I've had way better tacos for half the price, way better burritos for a dollar more.  Salsas get higher marks, if somewhat hit or miss. Tomatillo is a personal favorite of mine, and this place nails it. Perfect consistency, only slightly sweet. Salsa fresca is great as well. Big miss on the chile de arbol, their hottest. Decently hot, not particularly flavorful, the consistency of steak sauce.   Friendly service at the bar.",

We decided to take our family of 10 there for a birthday dinner last night and it was the.worse.service.everrrrr!!!!!! Don't get me wrong the food was still very good but our waitress was rude,ignored us, was lazy and had a bad attitude. Never did she tell us that only the FIRST round of chips and salsa was free and they charge every time after, then she wouldn't even bother to come back to refill our chips, salsa or water. The bus man was the one taking care of us most the night. One of our guests came late and she was aware of that and left him hanging for 10 min without coming back to get his order. And lastly, she refused to split our checks. We all were in couples and wanted it to be split per couple. She just threw down our 1 check and said \"we'll get this figured out\" and again left our table! We asked for an order of churros for dessert but wanted prices on them first, she said she didn't know off the top of her head but \"they aren't that expensive\" turns out it was near $11 for one order!!! Never bothered to tell us that and we ended up ordering 3 of them.. We tried to talk to the \"manager\" about how poorly our service was and he failed to even comp the churros or my brothers birthday beer that was spilled since the tables were ALLL UNEVEN! Needless to say the food was good, but paying almost $70 for fajitas, 2 tacos and churros is just ridiculous to me! There's no excuse of why she couldn't split our checks and even comped at least 1 order of churros. So disappointed!",

The tacos we tried, Baja and Pollo en Mole, were good but nothing to write home about. Our only complaint was the music.

Too bad, because the idea, ambiance and food are pretty good, but if I can't get someone's attention to enjoy it, what's the point??",

    "text": "My husband and I recently vacationed in Scottsdale and ate at Salt + Lime 3 times in one week...that's how much we loved it!!! The food and atmosphere is awesome - the house margarita is amazing.  During our first visit we sat at the bar and asked Mike what he recommended - he said \"anything with the barbacoa.\" Kevin had a veggie burrito and added Baracoa. It was just as amazing as Mike promised. I had a chicken quesadilla which was also very good. We could tell right away that the food was scratch-made as it was fresh and \"clean\" tasting.  During our second visit, Kevin had the chicken tortilla soup and added Baracoa to it...yummy! I had a Baja (fish) taco. We also tried a variety of salsas - pico de gallo, pineapple and arbol. The pineapple one is unique and very flavorful! We finished dinner that evening with churros. OMG...definitely try these! You have a choice of 2 or 4 (2 was plenty for us) along with choices of dipping sauces; we had lime and chocolate.  We are so happy we tried Salt + Lime and look forward to our next visit. A BIG shout out to Sandra, Mike, Alec and Ron for providing us with great service!",

    "text": "Not the best, but definitely not the worst. For starters, anytime the word \"Modern\" is included title, it means, \"overpriced.\" The chips & salsa were ok. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd rate their salsa at a 6. Ordered 2 tacos for lunch; the Baja and the Pollo+Mole. The Baja lacked a lot of flavor, while the Pollo was, meh. I ended up asking for additional avocado crema for the Baja and it came well after the food had already gone cold.   Never been a fan of the A la carte taco menu (regardless of restaurant) and definitely less of a fan when they're flavorless and overpriced. Sure, the environment was cool; think low-key. Several patrons eating alone alongside several large groups. I visited over the lunch hour. A return seems likely since my co-workers love it. Maybe my experience next time will be different?",

    "text": "First my disclaimer. I typically don't leave reviews unless I'm extremely impressed or extremly disappointed. In this case it's the latter for salt and lime. I'm a frequent salt and lime patron, so I know their food is really good, but I must say that today I couldn't say that. I want to say this may be my first time going to lunch at salt and lime, BUT I know for sure it'll be the last time. My sister and I went here for lunch today a little after noon and ordered the Grande Totopas, which from previous experiences, with an 's' on the end, we both know is always excellent. The totopas are basically nachos but a little fancier, our order from today pretty much consisted of everything left over from yesterday. The guacamole was brown, the sour cream looked like cottage cheese, and the pico also looked like yesterday leftovers. This meal is 16.35, and it upsets me to know that I paid that much for food from yesterday. If I wanted yesterday food, I would've went yesterday. My advice to customers is just be careful what you order if you're going for lunch, apparently this is the slow part of the day for them and they are serving food from the day before. I must say I'm very disappointed in Salt and Lime for this.",

But 3 times in a row now I've swung by for dinner over a half hour before their posted closing time and been greeted by a shrug and a \"sorry\".  Yep.  3 Times in a row they have determined that they are slower (on a weekend night) than the thought they'd be and are sweeping the floors.  Done.  \"Kitchen's closed.\"  I don't care if a place has 8pm as their closing time.  I will respect that and not go out of my way to drive there in order to arrive at 8:01.  That's fine.  You can be closed at any time that you want.  It's your business.  But when you are negligent and post a closing time with no intention on honoring it, shame on you.  The owners may not recognize that their staff is deciding to do this.  If so, now you know.  Closing time isn't an optional thing.  Yes, there have been 4am bars in small towns that will shut down at 2am if nobody is there.  But a restaurant that posts a reasonable closing time in Scottsdale and chooses to not honor it time after time after time, has no place in my rotation.  Thats no bueno.    Adios Salt and Lime.",

    "text": "My friends had been raving about Salt & Lime for a long time so finally I met them there this past Friday. When I got there they were already seated with a basket of greasy chips on the table and a tiny bowl of salsa. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm a quantity salsa eater and tiny bowls just don't cut it for me.  I had checked out the menu the night before and knew I'd order the Carne Asada Taco and the Grilled Ahi taco, both on corn tortillas and a side of black beans. First, the beans were excellent and the Carne Asada Taco was great and made to order. The Grilled Ahi taco was on a flour tortilla (you would think an \"authentic Mexican grill\" would default to corn) and had some strange items in it that weren't listed on the menu, like apple strings. I can be adventurous but I didn't care for apple strings in my grilled fish taco.   I might have asked for a replacement to correct the tortilla but by the time the food came I was already underwhelmed by the service. My friend and I had ordered ice teas which failed to show up. We asked for extra salsa, which had also failed to show. The waiter seemed extremely harried. When I asked what I thought was a simple question while ordering (whether the refried beans contain lard), he didn't know what I meant. We received no refills on the ice teas after they were finally delivered and no other checking up on our table.  This place is really cute, just charming. The patio is perfect for the October weather in Arizona and there's a nice vibe here. The lunch special of two (large) tacos and one side at $10.75 was a good deal and filling. But service, folks.   Still, I'll try again.",

We both ordered the \"street tacos\". I love that term. \"Street tacos\". Especially when served at a trendy gourmet type \"gastro pub\". It's the best oxymoron of modern cuisine.   We also ordered the small quac and chips with salsa. The garden salsa is really bland and the \"hot\" variation isn't much hotter. The salsa verde was the best. Especially on those gourmet street tacos. I had the carnita, beef, and chicken tacos. Of the three, the pork was the best. The beef a little bland, and the chicken dried out and stringy. The guacamole was the furthest thing from traditional guacamole I've ever had. Oranges slices?  Weird. Can't say I was a fan.   Anyway. Two appetizer orders of street tacos, chips and quac, an iced tea and a coke = $30 bucks and still hungry.   Not sure if I'll go back. I get the \"gastro pub\" business model. I just don't drink enough to appreciate it much anymore. If I did still drink like I used to, I would have found the food unquestionably delicious.",

Everyone was very friendly and we got fast service. I felt like we were well attended for.   The burrito I didn't care for but my 8 year old liked it. The shrimp and carne asada fajitas saved the meal. They were very good. The vegetables tasted very fresh and the flour tortillas were excellent. The street corn side was also tasty.

It was then given away to a party that just walked in. After questioning multiple people, the manager admitted that the owner knew those people and gave the table away causing us to wait almost twice as long as promised. Then, my meal was completely forgotten and I was unable to eat most of my meal with my family. We will never return, and as a fellow business owner, I hope the owner learns to treat all their patrons with the same respect.

Pretty sure it's the same one in the other reviews. We waited 45 minutes before anyone came back to see if we needed anything. Would of been great to have a couple more drinks and another appetizer but apparently we had our invisible attire on. We like to find places for work events etc...but will never come back again. Too bad, the atmosphere was great but the service is terrible and so is the bartenders attitude. Tried to contact the manager Sandra, had to leave a voicemail.",

I definitely like it and come here occasionally as I live in the neighborhood. I'd recommend.",

Waited a long time again and finally a waitress came. Waitress excuse 'we are busy'. I therefore asked for a manager. They just send another waiter to help us, no manager.  The last thing you want to do, especially in Scottsdale, is have customers wait, especially for food that also didn't get such high reviews.  A suggestion would be to get new manager, retrain staff, hire more help, and have the hostess manage expectations.",

When I came I ordered a margarita and she ordered a beer. It took a little while for them to come. Our next friend showed up and the waiter never came by I had to flag him down. She ordered wine, and we ordered our food. This is about 8pm. The wine took 15 minutes to come. And at 8:35pm our food finally showed up. I was not impressed with the service here at all. Our server had come to check on us once in between us waiting for our food, because we had looks on our face like, what is taking so long? Although the food is good. The service was the worst.

My co-workers and I ordered lunch for take out today at 10:45 am.  15 min. Before they opened.  We place 4 orders.  All of which were lunch specials.  For some reason they charged one of us the entree price $14 vs. $9 for the lunch special also never asked if it was a lunch or entree order.   When we tried to explain how it was obviously for lunch the hostess (very nice and polite) took our issue to the manager who REFUSED to give is the lunch rate since the extra tamale had already been boxed up.  Completely illogical and unnecessary response.  We work for CVS and this is the closest take out to our Az head quarters.    Three of us really enjoyed our lunches (chicken mole bowls and the green chili enchiladas...the charro beans are ok). Our poor friend who paid $14 for a take out lunch was unimpressed as well she should be w/ $14 dry tamales with beans on top.  We will not be going back and will be sure to spread the word through CVS of this experience.  Take Away: you never know who you are serving, customer service is still important. It may impact your business 10 fold.  Disappointed and Irritated!",

Lots of fresh ingredients.  Serving sizes were too big, especially for lunch. It looks like they have the same menu for lunch and dinner (although I didn't ask). 3 enchiladas are too many at lunch time, because those chips are filling! So we split an order of the green chili enchiladas and (she had 2) I got a carne asada taco.  It was all delicious. Everything was fresh and yummy.  The food split was perfect, although I still ate too many chips. But that salsa was verry good!   Great attentive staff. Good food. We will be back!",

We had the house margaritas (5.00 on happy hour) which were very tasty. We decided to order a second one and my husbands came looking very green compared to mine and our previous ones. Upon tasting it it appeared that it had more mix than anything else. We requested a remake which they complied with with no issue. We had a burrito which was a good size (and split it) but only my half had the guacamole in it and his half did not. For 12 bucks you get a better deal and flavor at chipotle. We had the black beans and they were so salty we couldn't even eat them.  Then the bill came with gross caked on salas in the clipboard. WAY over priced for the quality.  Gosh- we wanted to love this place but sadly could not give it more than 1 star-",

Meanwhile, I heard 2 other customers complain about the heat and they told the waiter they were hot.  Once the gentlemen outside left the waiter said the manager refused to let him close the window. I guess the manager texted the owner who wasn't there and the owner told them no.  I asked if they would at least turn the air conditioner on since there were multiple customers complaining and he said there was nothing he could do about it.",

My other issue was the noise level. Off the charts!",

It is chili braised short ribs that melt in your mouth topped with Oaxaca cheese and pico de gallo. This was a huge hit! Their chips and salsa that come to the table complimentary are also always warm, crispy and fresh. I have enjoyed myself the three times I have visited Salt & Lime and plan to come back this summer! I also enjoyed them sending out coupons to the nearby neighborhoods which allowed me to try them for the first time! Good thinking, S & L!  Update!! Your iced tea is VERY weak!",

It looked like a cute place (people sitting on the patio and flat screens all over), and I was craving some chips and salsa so we decided to check it out.  They brought us a basket of chips with a small bowl of their fresh salsa.  I ordered the triple salsa so I could try three more (pico, habanero, and tomatillo) for $5.  The pico was okay, tomatillo was a little sweet, but the habanero was AMAZING (super spicy with a great flavor!).  I had the skinny margarita (really good), ordered the nachos for dinner, and my boyfriend ordered quesadillas.  My nachos were amazing!  Although every chip was covered with toppings, they did not get soggy throughout dinner.  The chips served with the salsa were fresh and crispy, and I used them to eat some of the additional toppings that were falling off the nachos.  My boyfriend also ate the nachos with me (we didn't even finish them!) and only ate 1 piece of his quesadilla (there were 4).  He said the quesadilla was alright, but we both agreed the nachos were awesome!  The best thing about this restaurant was the service, though.  Our waiter was very friendly and ensured we always had what we needed.  Overall, this is a great spot and I'm glad we ended up stumbling into it on a Sunday night for dinner :)",

Tonight, not so much. Charged for everything extra without warning. Cheese, chips, salsa. Meat very over cooked. Hardly any meat whatsoever. So, meat should not be crunchy.   Staff should've explained that they charge for everything. I tried calling them for over an hour to get hours and it was a constant busy signal. I mentioned it to them and they acted like it was no big deal.   My wife wants to try it and I am going to tell her never again. She would not be impressed at all.   My recommendation is to go to another Mexican restaurant that has much better food. Taco Bell for instance. Jalapeno Inferno would be ten times better. Maybe even Blanco. If you want to try this place, wait till they close and something else opens in its place.",

When I first arrived for happy hour at around 5:30 I was actually pretty impressed. My friend arrived around 6:00. Our waitress was attentive and the teamwork of the employees was impeccable. Our food was running behind however with how busy it was I completely understood and had no problem waiting. My friend and I received our food, Ate and ordered a few more drinks. All sounds great until around 7:30 when the MANAGER came and slid the table that was next to us into ours... she informed me she had a group of 6 people coming in and was just getting ready for the turn around. I still had half my drink left and let the manager know. She then exclaimed she \"wasn't trying to rush me out\" and then proceeded to say \"you paid right?\" And opened the check in front of me... (we had just paid maybe 5 min. Ago and as stated earlier I was finishing my drink. I understand if there was a big party that was waiting to be seated and had I just been asked, I would have happily moved to another table. However, our food was late and after a $75 bill i felt completely unvalued. I hope if you visit you are treated with more respect and value.",

This is my favorite restaurant in the desert!!!!!!!",

First, they were out of the medium salsa which is odd, our server said it was because they had gotten slammed the night before.   Don't you make it everyday?   Next, the pork in the street tacos was a little dry. In fact, I had to remove a couple pieces that were grisly hard.  I did give a bonus star for great service which was greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "First time here and as soon as we sat down I thought, I'm going to really like this place. Atmosphere was great and the menu had a bunch of choices. We came just for a quick trip for some drinks and an appetizer before we had to be somewhere. Got there at 4:40 and didn't leave till 5:30. This was not because we were having drinks on drinks, this was cause the service was very, very poor. We each only had two drinks and our appetizer was probably out 5 minutes after we ordered, but our server Ron was not good. I ordered my second drink ( which I had to ask the guy that brings the chips, to get) and watched  Ron go hangout behind the bar with the bartender for about 5 min. Finally another waitress brought my drink. It was the wrong drink. I had a few sips and kept telling my boyfriend that this is definitely not the one I ordered. The waitress was polite and came back a few minutes later and apologized that it was the wrong drink. So she took it and I thought I would be getting the correct one. Finally Ron comes over a minute later and says that the waitress should've just left the drink for me and he would've taken it off my bill, and that they do not have the stuff to make the drink I ordered off there menu. So I ordered a different one and then 3 minutes later we received it. Oh and during all this I asked for the bill when we ordered our second round, cause we were in a hurry and I basically had to wave it in his face in order for him to come pick it up. Would've figured after the 10 minutes waiting for another drink and them messing up, that they would've at least taken that off my bill, and they didn't of course. Needless to say, I liked this place from the start and could've seen it as a new hAngout, but probably never going back. Only gave it two stars cause I did like the appetizer and first drink I ordered.",

We were seated at a table that was dirty/sticky. There were no place settings nor were any ever brought over. I finally had to get up and get them myself. The floors were filthy. While waiting for our order to be taken, I actually observed a server wiping all the leftover food at another table onto the floor. Speaking of waiting for our order, we waited about 30 min for our drink order to be delivered. We waited another 15 for our main meal to arrive. The salads were good -thus the two stars-but the service and cleanliness deserve a zero. It may be time to find a new Mexican restaurant.",

That being said, the remainder of our dining experience was significantly less impressive.  We received no free chips and salsa - not a huge deal but I thought it worth mentioning.  The food both looks and sounds impressive but it was incredibly bland.  I got the tamales and honestly, I have purchased more flavorful tamales from a gentleman selling them in the parking lot at Fry's.  Salt & Lime's tamales were also not very filling - I was hungry about an hour later.  My boyfriend got the crispy pork which was not crispy or seasoned in any way prior to cooking.  The street corn, however, was excellent and by far the best side dish that they had.  All in all, at $15-$17 a plate, it was not worth it if you are looking for flavorful Mexican food.  We more than likely will not be back, particularly with so many other, better options in the area.",

My al pastor tacos were so flavorful and the barbacoa short rib  meat was really tender. Also, the tacos were large and filling. Came with black beans that were very good. The chips provided were just the right thickness and fresh. The salsa was thick with just the right burn--not too much. I will go back to try some of the other specialty tacos they serve.

Unless you douche your sweet corn in the same carcass the barbacoa was carved from, there isn't any other explanation to how bad it was.   Wait staff was polite, they used common phrases such as \"was this yours?\" and \"I don't know which taco that is.\" - also ignore questions like, \"May we order now?\" and \"I'll have corn on the COB\"   One star for the house margarita, which wasn't bad.",

I am not a pork lover (I don't get what anybody sees in a porkchop, for example) but their pork carnitas are the best anywhere. Right up there is the carne asada. Wood grilled, charcoal grilled maybe? I don't know but incredibly flavorful. Unlimited salsa and chips, great daily (weekend too) happy hour prices. I would feel comfortable coming here alone or with others. I see people who look comfortable doing either.  Chill place to go on a weekend late morning or afternoon, after work, too.",

It looked beautiful and was served in a nice glass, with a cool green salted rim. However, it tasted like it came from a premade mix and was too sweet. I would expect a fresh and balanced margarita for this type of restaurant (upscale Mexican) and price point. I then switched to the red sangria which was decent. For food, I order the mini chimis which were $2 off for happy hour. The chimis has an external texture more similar to an egg roll. The inside was overly moist and didn't have the typical chimichanga filling and taste. It was served on top of bed of lettuce, which had some pieces that looked not so fresh. It's rare for me to not leave a clean plate, but I could only eat about half of them before I gave up.   I ultimately gave this place 2 stars because the chips & salsa were great! The service was also good, but I would not come back.",

High quality pork and a great grill taste! After I enjoyed the first order I HAD to order the street tacos to see what other great things the kitchen could do! Great atmosphere and awesome food! If you are looking for a taste of Mexico with modern (new combinations) tastes, this is your place! Try it out and you will not be disappointed! The staff and owner are a lot of fun as well!

For drinks had the skinny b (cucumber and basil something or other) and the house margarita. Both were good, but the margarita was better. I could see the bar has a good selection of tequila. They should add a tequila flight tasting to the menu to showcase them.   Had the pineapple salsa and the habanero salsa with my complimentary chips and salsa. LOVED the habanero. Great flavor and heat. Liked the pineapple, but not as much as the habanero.   Also had the mole and ahi tacos. Really enjoyed the mole tacos. The ahi ones came in a lettuce wrap but I wish I had gotten a tortilla instead. The lettuce had a hard time holding all of the wonderful filling which was a shame because the ahi was perfect and the toppings were really well conceived.    I'd compare it most closely to z tejas, but with the added bonus of being local. Also, more uniqueness and variety. I'll definitely go back.",

My kids have never liked their meals there. The last time we ate there we all felt kind of sick when we got home.

Serving tacos on the little holders is a great idea, keeps the mess down.  Nothing exactly bad to say, just a bit steep on the pricing for what you get. It's a good place to check out, but nothing really 'popped' for me--the \"modern Mexican cantina' theme is nice, but not fresh.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying good drinks and food however the coordination of the staff for cinco de mayo not so much. I wanted to have a nice cinco de mayo so I decided to come here. Upon arriving I noticed they reserved an entire outdoor area in the parking lot for the guests. Cool, however all it consisted of was four tables with a maximum of four chairs. The outdoor area was as big as the inside but only sat 16 ppl at a maximum. Wasted space..... the rest of the section was reserved for staff and outdoor drink areas which were cash only according to the woman in charge. Not sure why when you can pay with a credit card inside. Half the tables were in the sun and only one waiter worked all the outdoor tables. It took me 30 minutes to get a drink. Anyways, I decided to move one of the tables under a tint for shade. I moved it by a foot. Next thing I know the lady in charge of the set up comes over to me and says I need to move it back in the sun because a band was coming to play music. Not sure why one foot would prevent the band from playing music but whatever. She also added \"don't move my furniture\". Not wanting to stoop to her level I said okay and walked away. I mean like I guess she knows ppl love sitting in the hot sun under no shade in AZ. It's not like the sun is bright and it's hot here in the desert or anything....... I watched as she continually got mad at her staff and at one point yanked a chair out from underneath her hostess who was sitting. She made her staff stand in the hot sun outside under no shade and wait for ppl to get drinks at the cash only bar. Nobody ever got drinks bc it's cash only and literally 5 ft away you can use a card at the bar inside. Also the staff outside looked absolutely miserable because of the woman in charge making them stand in the hot sun. So I witnessed 5 staff members doing nothing for an hour but bake in the hot sun being miserable. Maybe a few of them could wait tables outside to help that one waiter so ppl don't wait for 30 minutes for a drink. Not sure who the lady in charge was but obviously she had it all figured out. After witnessing a bunch of ppl show up and leave after taking a look at the situation I decided to leave. I wanted to grab more drinks but didn't want to wait 30 minutes each time. Don't come here it's a waste of cinco de mayo.   P.S. I found an eye lash in my taco. How do I know it was an eye lash, it had all the characteristics of one. With its half crescent moon smooth curvature it sat as proud as the woman in charge on the top middle of my taco. As I grabbed it to remove it I could hear the woman in charge voice say \"don't move my furniture\".",

I've gone maybe 10x since moving to AZ last year; my orders are always to go & each time my order is incorrect. My bad for not checking before I leave, but it's usually an order for 4-6 ppl & it already takes so long for them to get the order out I don't have the patience to sit, unpack & open each box (especially when they box the sides separately too).  I usually order a few veggie burritos & few rice & bean burritos - no cheese, no sour cream on anything, but it never fails - there's cheese or sour cream somewhere.  One time they even forgot my (2) rice & bean burritos...I tried to go back, but the cooks had left. The restaurant was still open (for the bar patrons, I'm assuming), but I couldn't pick up my missing items. They gave me a $25 gc, which was pretty much the price of the missing items...I should've requested a refund along with the gc.   It is hard to be upset when each time, whoever answers the phone, is a sweet as can be.  I mean they are really so nice & apologetic! S&L lucks out on that end. Unfortunately, my husband likes the \"healthy\" part of it if we have to order in so I feel forced to return. BUT is it too much to ask that if u have me waiting for 30-40 mins for my order, to offer me a beverage or comp my ONE beer...maybe some chips & salsa as sit forever for an order I know is not going to be 100% correct.",

Their patio is nice with open space and misters. I gave this place 3 stars because every single time I've eaten here I've had to get up to find the waiter for something...more water, more chips or salsa, cutlery, stupid little things that the waiter should see when/if he passes by. Therein lies the problem. Its never overwhelmingly busy but the waiter is always MIA. Tonight I had to ask for cutlery cuz there were none on the table, then we asked for more water AND more salsa, oh and we asked for a to-go box. I really love their kale salad with carnitas on the side. Their drinks are huge. But the service has sucked. Every. Single. Time! Please Manager, can you teach your wait staff to come around and wait on your customers!!!",

Though it's seat yourself, the waiters are right on top of getting right over to you to get your drink order and drop off your chips and salsa.  The chips and salsa are great as well. The chips were warm and the salsa was not overly spicy. For my main I ordered the dos tacos lunch special with a carnitas taco and a carne asada taco and a side of rice. Both tacos were stuffed a little too full so my cheese fell out when I tried to eat it :( The carnitas were extremely dry. The beef in the carne asada was better, but still just ok. The rice was ok, but again, nothing special.   You can't beat the price and they have an outdoor patio, but I was overall pretty disappointed with the food.",

Our other topping choice was the Chicken Tinga which might have been good but didn't stand a chance against the Barbacoa.  Sorry - I'm not a big meat eater these days, and this was really good!

They then told us that they would not refill our chips and salsa....and that they would need to charge us.    Next, we all ordered the combination fajitas per the waiter's recommendation, and were shocked at how little we had of any meat and of that, how overcooked and salty everything was.    We're all very disappointed in the quality of food we had for the money we spent, along with why Salt and Lime skimps on chips and salsa, especially in large groups.    I do not recommend that anyone return.",

I looked in the kitchen and she was scooping my chips with her bare hands. Excuse me, dirty hands that were previously scratching her head. When I mentioned such, she denied it and to top it off the manager did not allow her best customer service skills to shine through. As I mentioned to the manager, check your cameras and see for yourself.   My previous visit on April 1, 2016 was a dine in with others. Happy Fool's Day to me. The check came and my friends paid in cash and I used a card. The following day, I checked my account and I was charged for the entire bill with a separate transaction for the bill I signed. Trust, we all make mistakes; however, I expect the server to advise me that she perhaps made an error. I should not have to check my account and call the restaurant.",

    "text": "This situation really makes me mad!  I loved the food at Salt and Lime.  The carne asada fajitas were fantastic, so was my sangria.  All of our food was well worth the trip.  The problem was the service, it was ridiculously bad.  We waited 10 minutes to be greeted another 10 to get our drinks and a full 40 minutes from our drinks arriving until we received our food.  We had to ask our server where it was and he said it was on hold in the kitchen for some reason and that the manager would be over to talk with us.  He then returned 15 minutes later to tell us his manager didn't want to talk to us.  Sandra apparently didn't feel like we rated her time.  Whoever owns this place should fire any manager who refuses to speak to a customer for any reason.  We walked in the door at 5:04 and didn't get out until 6:40 and we didn't linger, that is simply how long it took.  We were never graced with Sandra's presence, instead the bar tender came over in her place and said this happens all the time.    To the owner, if you value your business hire a GM who cares about your customers.  We loved your food, but the service was terrible.  This is an easy fix if your management cared enough to try.    In the end, the bar tender bought us our second round of drinks per my suggestion.  I wanted to pay for the food since when it finally came it was great!  I actually had to explain how they should handle customer service.  Good luck if you keep Sandra, management trickles down.",

The food is awesome, and their happy hour specials are amazing! I have tried almost all their tacos and love the combinations!

The tacos were small and had little flavor.  The nachos had a cheez-whiz taste to them.  It seemed like they were using quality meat, but had no idea how to make it into a gourmet meal.  Basically, it's Garcia's with a better atmosphere.  Too bad it's not priced that way - I would have given it three stars.",

    "text": "After 9 years at another, this is now our new favorite Mexican place!   We've went twice in two days and both times it was exceptionally good--with excellent service.    This wonderful restaurant specializes in modern Mexican food.  Don't expect the re-fried-beans-and-greasy-melted-cheddar type Mexican food of traditional Mexican restaurants.  If you are craving something freshly made, with quality ingredients, prepared in an elevated way---go here.  You won't regret it!    The fajitas are fabulous---richly caramelized onions and finely julienned vegetables sizzled to that perfect, deeply tasteful point--done better than anywhere I've ever had before.  They have a ton of flavor!  Well-portioned, too.  I loved every bite, but took half home (we also had chips and guac as an appetizer).  I also tried the Kale Salad.  It was so delicious!!!  It was refreshing to get a good, clean tasting salad with fresh ingredients and nice textures at a Mexican restaurant, where salads are notoriously boring, use head lettuce, pink tomatoes and are loaded with gooey everything.  This salad was a wonderful change-- fresh, light, flavorful and satisfying---truly yummy.    The guacamole is outstanding. So fresh---so delicious!  The salsas are also very good.  The Chili Arbol was our favorite---but the traditional salsa is also good.  One last thing that really sung was the Street Corn.  Ohhhh.... soooo delicious!  You just gotta try it.  Fabulously indulgent.  The manager, Daniel, came by to check in on us and the wait staff were excellent during both visits.  (Gigi and Molly)  The right amount of friendly and attentive.  I could tell that everyone there was proud of where they worked and genuinely cared that we had a great experience.    At first, we hesitated coming as the reviews we read after it first opened were mixed.  At one point (my fault), I thought this was going to be like the \"Modern Margarita,\" (another restaurant in the area that is essentially a night-club-posing-as-a-restaurant).  I was totally wrong.  Wish I hadn't waited so long to give it a try!  The atmosphere was  just right for us.  We are a couple in our early 40s-- we love high quality food and service, but we don't like stuffy, pretentious restaurants.  The area was previously loaded with the former.  Thank goodness places like Salt & Lime are starting to come to this area---realizing that you can have a beautiful restaurant that can pull off a modern rustic feel and make you feel comfortable and happy while having a great meal!  I love a place where you can wear jeans, but get top notch service and dining.  For a ton of reasons, we'll be back many times.  I'm already craving the guac, fajitas, and that kale salad again....  decisions....",

    "text": "Salt & Lime makes me happy for so many reasons....  Guacamole - delicious, fresh, big portion, about half the price of guac elsewhere.  Queso - we had the chorizo version once and it was very good but we have had the plain cheese the last three times and it is really delicious.  Quesadilla - tried it without the chicken, portion is huge and stuffed with cheese, not too greasy...just enough to make it indulgent.  Nachos - we have had them a few times (minus chicken) and they really do a nice job here.  The chips are freshly made and they load them up with cheese, pico, sour cream, black beans, corn, and an avocado cream topping.  I feel like driving back for more nachos after typing this they're so good.  Salsa - if you like salsa, do yourself a favor and get the 3 for $5.  Tomatillo salsa is better than you think it's going to be, it's thick and rich and tangy...not the pale green watery stuff you get at other places.  Pineapple - get it.  Habanero - to get such a great smoky flavor with that amount of heat is not easy, this place gets it right.  Chili de Arbol - I was bold on our first trip and said \"no place really serves very hot salsa\" (as it is listed on their menu), I was wrong.  Tacos - Beef Barbacoa taco is the best of the bunch as far as I'm concerned. Carne Asada was good.  Pollo Mole - my husband still talks about this one, he loved it.  Short Rib Barbacoa - we got this for the first time a few nights ago as take out...when I opened the container it was like some wonderful grandma was in the kitchen all day making a delicious Sunday dinner for us to enjoy.  It was a gigantic serving, fork tender, seasoned beautifully with potato and carrot in a brothy gravy.    All this and the prices are outstanding.

I could have used another one last night after taking down those first two chicken tacos, but being the conservative diner I am, I stopped at five so my fellow diners wouldn't think I'm a hog. I'm glad I did too.  A fine selection of Mexican beer and a pretty waitress managed to do their handiwork after the dozen or so pints just sort of snuck-up on me. That's when I started ordering tacos like judgment day was fast approaching. It was about this time I started thinking how handy it'd be to have two stomachs; the first to process the beer and the other for tacos n' shit. Jesus, I would have cleaned 'm out of tacos last night.  The chicken is charred black and tastier than all hell. The corn tortillas were above average with a slight sweetness. The salsa was weird, but fuck it, the tacos were tasty enough on their own.  Anyhow, fuel eating doesn't play here. It's either sport or feelings, pick one. I did both but I'm paying for it today, farting all nine musical octives.  If my sphincter was a bit tighter, I could probably hit high C.",

    "text": "Went on a Saturday night, were seated immediately.  It was pretty busy, there were never more than 2-3 tables empty.  The atmosphere:  Modern, industrial weathered decor, but the right touch of rustic.   Definitely going against the traditional mexi-rest decor.  Think of a mexican restaurant you might stumble upon in Fallout: New Vegas or Mad Max.  The pinatas and sombreros have been stripped away, all that's left is weathered metal, dark wood, and muted colors, modest lighting (which is the perfect accompaniment) and great food.  The restaurant does face west and they have an ample patio to enjoy views of the mountains and sunsets.  The service:  Attentive, friendly, not too talkative and prompt.  Michelle was our server near the bar and she efficiently took our orders, answered everything we asked.  When the food came out I was impressed that it was brought by 3 different people to make sure we were served efficiently.  Nice touch.  The menu:  Very creative.  Not over the top, plenty of standards but you can tell the kitchen took the time to consider and put their personal touch on each and every dish.  Since it was happy hour, we stuck mainly to the appetizers menu, but that was not a compromise.  More on food below.  The humble chicken quesadilla came with a delicious spicy avocado crema.    The drinks:  My only suggestions lie with the cocktails and the wines.  If they hired a mixology consultant or bartender as good as the chef, that would do it.  (I am available with a little notice.)  The drinks menu was adequate, but 4 reds and 4 whites (who's ordering all this red in a mexican restaurant?) and about 8 beers and 7-8 cocktails (4 of which sounded identical) was stingy at best.  Then there were like 30 tequilas.  OK, a little help here?  That said, my date's casa-rita was excellent and one was enough for her.  The wine pours were generous, at least 8-10 oz, which is good for the $6-10 glass prices.  The food:  The food was excellent.  Definitely the best for at least 15 miles, from the chips and salsa to the ceviche, to the jalapenos rellenos which i loved.  Probably the only place I've had better neo-Mex was in New York city.  The presentation was  creative, colorful, well garnished and arranged.  Everything came out sizzling and the server was very attentive, visiting us at twice during our appetizer course.  Clearing was efficient as well, and I really like the team approach of this wait staff vs. having to scan for your one server all evening.  I will definitely be back to try the crispy fried carnitas and the full relleno.  I loved that the jalapenos rellenos were not fried, just stuffed and broiled.  Frying is great, but it's nice to have an un-fried option once in a while.  The prices:  The prices were excellent for what you get, notably the specials.  Portions were very generous, so if something looked expensive, it is probably enough for 2 people.",

Your new menu is fine, but now you have to pay extra to experience the chips and salsa. The waitress will bring you a flavorless version salsa that resembles ketchup with spices, but it doesn't compare to the pineapple salsa, or verde salsa you now have to pay for. This is not good customer service. Having to pay extra for your good salsa seems cheap. Just take it off the menu if you're not going to allow people to try it.   As for the food: Burritos are tasty, Relleno is okay, the beef, shrimp and pork tacos are yummy. I tried the Baja taco today ... Icky! It resembled battered frozen fish from  a grocery store. It's far from Baja!   The service has been good and the beer is cold, chips are crunchy and hot, but again, don't get your hopes up on the salsa. If you want good, free salsa, go to Blue Adobe Grill on Frank Lloyd Wright. It's delicious and complimentary.",

    "text": "If your a fan of weak overly sweet margaritas, American/Mexi food that's bland, made with mostly very dry meats, in a very LOUD rubbing elbows bar and circus like atmosphere this is for YOU!   We entered the small restaurant and were almost knocked out by the loud volume of 70s classics anthem songs. As we sat we were quickly served a basket of half crushed chips and a salsa that lacked typical salsa flavors. Since there was four of us we ordered a pitcher of margaritas. After one sip I found the margarita cloyingly sweet and almost liquor free. It was like sucking on hummingbird water. Someone was running around giving everyone tickets for a floatation giveaway in the bar. The number was called soon after and someone left with a nifty corona floatation raft.  A table gets sat next to us and one person from our table really didn't have any space between them and the person from the next table.  We all thought tacos would be a good appetizer since they were on special for happy hour. My husband's short rib taco was very dry and was bland. It lacked fresh herbs and chiles, it was very flat as well as the tacos the other people had at the table. I had the snapper taco. They did prepare the fish better than all the other meats but it also lacked flavors and the flavor it did have was mostly just strong vinegar from the pickled onions. It lacked fresh green onions, fresh cilantro and a pop of chiles would have been nice. It just tasted vinegary with really super sweet chunks of pineapple that seemed like sweetened canned pineapple.  Out of the three appetizers, the drinks, and four dinners only my dinner was actually very good. But I got the kale and mango salad. My salad was prepared nicely, it was tasty and what really surprised me was that the salmon was cooked very nicely. I do note that this might have been the most expensive item on the menu and was a WHOPPING $18.75 for a salad. I know it's Scottsdale but that is higher pricing than what a salad cost on the strip in Las Vegas. I also note the salad did come in small and large and when I asked about the difference my interpretation was that the small looked like a four inch side salad and the large looked like about a foot.   My husband had the carnitas that was very dry and undeveloped with flavor.  One person at the table had the carne asada fajitas. They were very dry and that person told the waitress and she offered to make a new dish  and latter took the fajitas off the bill.  I thought our server was friendly and efficient.  This is a mixed review but overall it averages to below average so that equals two stars to me.",

After talking to a couple additional wait staff it was clear they all feared her.

Our server was extremely hard to find and there were all of 5 tables in the restaurant. Not to mention, they closed at 11 and at 10 they started flipping chairs over onto tables and the busser came over and asked us for our salt and pepper, drink book etc. When we cracked a joke to him about it he proceeded to go inside, talk to the other wait staff about us and point at us. You're closing down the restaurant with tables still in it. The waitstaff were loudly discussing how they had never closed before (probably new) -- just awkward. Definitely will not be returning.",

A string of happenstances seemed to be plaguing the staff and the kitchen, but the food we tried was terrific.   Unfortunately, I didn't get the impression that our server was all that on his game even on a good day. Word from surrounding tables (since our server never actually explained this) was that the kitchen got several large to-go orders, which was the reason our appetizers (yes, appetizers) took an hour to come out.   Not quite sure why our server disappeared and never returned until we were long finished with our first course. Never asked if we wanted to order anything else, brought refills, checked on us, etc. He was like a wisp of smoke.   When the food finally did arrive, it was fantastic. We tried the nachos and a chile relleno, and planned on ordering a few tacos. But the combination of the massive pile of food placed in front of us, and the long-wait time prevented us from continuing down the road to stuffed-pigsville.   In conclusion, I would definitely come back on another night, but hope beyond hope that we got a different server because all the others seemed to be handling the difficulties with much more ease...and much more presence than the dancing bearded hipsterry fellow who was assigned to take care of us...and didn't.",

The wait staff was wonderful but guests at nearby table refused to buy us a round of drinks despite our insistence.  Honestly we couldn't tell the difference between the blended and on the rocks margaritas - both were good but we recommend the FREE churros with the caramel sauce - chocolate kinda sucked.  Ask Ally at the front desk for more fanfare because we felt it kinda lacked and they need a more coordinated Birthday song repertoire.  We probably will be back",

Holy cow the best salsa I have ever had super HOT I also got a salad with chicken very very good. and the service this time excellent.  This place is worth the time to check out.

They are large, and their flavors/selections are  great! I went for the shrimp taco, and hubby went for the barbacoa taco....twice. we were super delighted w our choices. The chili relleno appetizer was pretty good. Not a very big chili, but lots of tasty sauce, cheese and other ingredients. I like that they have different salsa choices....pineapple, habanero, and my hubby's fave the arbol(sp? The other hot option). The veggie burrito enchilada style was awesome! I love that each time I've dined here I've tried something new and really liked it! Wait staff was a tad slow, but we weren't in a hurry. We will be back!",

However the manager, Sandra, was completely awful. She treats her staff poorly and has no business being a manger. The last two times we were there she blamed her kitchen staff for the mess up of our food saying they all need to be fired because they are awful. Then The last time we were there she wanted to close early so she turned the lights on everyone and made our server ask us for the check off our table. She literally snaps her fingers at her staff like a dog and tells them what to do. She's completely awful. After reading so many bad reviews about her I don't understand how or why she's still the manager there. I would love to go back but never will I until she's gone. If anyone else goes there I hope you don't have to encounter her.",

    "text": "6/4/15  Cute bar (with lime lighting on the underside of the counter).  Appreciated the purse hooks on the counter wall underneath, as well.  Nice patio seating and bar placement.  It's rare that I feel out of place dining at a restaurant; Although the clientele that day was a multi-generational mix, I felt that the restaurant is leaning towards a younger crowd with their young bartenders, servers, and manager-on-duty.    I ordered a Skinny B margarita (made with house tequila- Sauza Reposada?- fresh lime juice, and agave syrup) and the chicken enchiladas, subbing flour tortillas for the corn tacos, for happy hour ($2 off specific cocktails, beer, and wine specials, as well as appetizer and taco specials).  Complimentary chips and salsa fresca-- I was the first guest to ask for flour tortilla chips and try them here!  The chips and salsa were good, and so was the margarita.  I DID NOT care for the enchiladas at all; the green sauce (was that were all the spinach went?} was almost unpalatable.  Don't know why I ate as much as I did- around half of the two rolls.  Did not bother taking the rest home.  I also tried the bread pudding, which came with strawberries and a sweetened tequila sauce.  It wasn't anything special, but it was very warm and the sauce creamy, which is something I look for in a bread pudding. The dessert rang under $7 and was the largest serving I ordered at S&L.  I ate about 1/6 of the serving and took the rest home.  It's still sitting in the fridge, untouched.  Probably should just toss it away, as it's been four days...  Didn't feel well by the time I arrived home, and I went straight home and did not pass go.  It's not the first time I had half of a cocktail/glass of wine after getting a massage, but I'm sure it had to do with the combo of tequila and everything I ate; Possibly the green enchiladas and/or the tequila components of both the margarita and bread pudding, who knows?  Maybe I'll give Salt & Lime another go, but it won't be anytime soon.",

It's hard to find a good Mexican place that has vegetarian food, so it's always a gamble for me.  But this one paid off and big.

They also have a nice patio for outside dining. We were greeted at the door promptly and decided on outside dining with the evening being nice. Our waitress was prompt in taking our drink order and returned with chips and a great roasted salsa. We choose the Green Chili ENCHILADAS, which were excellent. Creamy and spicy with moist chicken. Our other selection was the gourmet tacos. Choosing the Baja fish taco, filled with a nicely battered white fish fillet, fresh cabbage, and wonderful sauce. The other was the carne asada taco. The meat was tender and moist, and very flavorful. They are served on either corn or flour tortilla, or, as a lettuce wrap. At $4.50 this was priced right. We ordered a side of Charro Beans, which could use some spice/heat. The prices were very good. The chips and salsa, first rate. The service was very good, too. We would definitely return to try more items on the menu...",

I had the Mole tacos that are one of the best things I have ever tasted. The waitress was super helpful and friendly. I will be back for more. This place is tasty with a sexy ambiance.  Love it!",

    "text": "Nice atmosphere and patio.  Good service. The food was just ok. We had the house salsa, pineapple salsa and the guacamole.  They were ok, but had too much lime and I love lime.  The appetizer chicken chimichanga was ok. The chicken mole taco tasted like chicken thighs, which I am not a fan of.  I was told it was chicken breast. My husband had the green chili chicken enchilada and it was good.  We were excited to try a New Mexican restaurant and were disappointed.",

My husband had the Asada taco and said it would be one he would order again.  We had the habanero salsa, it was very good had lots of kick just the way we like it.  Salt and Lime will be a definite repeat.",

The pineapple salsa was fabulous, as was the tres leches. Price was reasonable and overall the food was very fresh and delicious. We will definitely come back soon!",

    "text": "I have dined at Salt and Lime before, and I was very happy with the food, however it took a very long time despite the fact that it was not crowded at all. I went to get lunch with a friend who had not been there before, I recommended it. I got there at 2:45, but my friend got a little lost and took until 3 to get there. I when I went into the restaurant I noticed we had no lunch menus, and asked for them. My waiter told me they stopped serving lunch at 3. I told him at 3:05 that I wanted the \"Pollo Bowl,\" which is not much more than grilled chicken, beans and mild salsa. I came specifically for this dish that is not available on the dinner menu. My waiter told me he did not have any way to enter the order into his computer system. I understood this was something he couldn't do anything about and asked to speak to his manager. A blond haired woman came over and said that lunch is not available after 3 because the kitchen is not prepared to make lunch items anymore. I could understand that there could be a computer issue if lunch specials could not be entered after 3. This is something that a manager should be able to deal with.  The food in the kitchen does not dissipate between the time of 3 and 3:05 and there is no reason for the manager, who was a little bit rude, to tell me I cannot order something because I am 5 minutes past decided end time for lunch. I left and went to La Fonda Del Sol mexican food (less than 5 minutes down the street) where I ordered a lunch special, which was amazing and had phenomenal service.",

    "text": "I would have given this place 3 stars but they don't advertise on their website or menu that you only get one complimentary basket of chips and one small dish of salsa. If you want more that'll be $2.00 each time they bring you more. This was pretty much the theme of the night. I ordered the fajitas which didn't come with any cheese or lettuce, so I ordered some on the side at a cost of $1.00 each for these little cups of it. The fajita entree was $15.00 to begin with so I seriously think they could give you some cheese and lettuce to put on your tortilla. They brought me 4 tortillas with the entree and when I asked for more our waitress brought 2 for another $1.00. It might just be me but $1.00 for two corn tortillas is a bit steep. Besides for the prices this place was pretty good. It was a bit noisy but clean and the food was good just not for the price. For 3 people the bill ended up being $65.00 with one appetizer, three entrees and no drinks since we all drank water.",

    "text": "We visited on 1/29/15 for lunch. The location in a strip mall is never one of my favorites but I did like the cozy atmosphere of the restaurant. Smaller than I thought it would be  but glad it was.  I am in a wheelchair due to a hip surgery gone awry so the hostess (?) pulled the chair away so I could roll up to the table. Good service, friendly staff. We started with the Mini Enchiladas...tasty but a tad spicy for me. Hubby said the more he ate, the more he liked them. Chips and Salsa...salsa was really good...has a little heat and very flavorful. Had 3 Carne Asada street tacos w/Street Corn and Mango Jicama slaw. Carne Asada could have used a tad more seasoning...tasted kind of bland but I put some Pineapple Salsa on it...better. I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the Street Corn...perfect if you add a dash of salt. I could make a meal of that. Jicama Slaw was a nice, light touch...had Flan for dessert...fantastic! The caramel sauce was divine...nice and thick not watery like some flan. House Margarita was very good...light and refreshing! If you're looking for Tex-Mex food this is not for you..this is much fresher, tastier and more authentic than everything smothered in cheese...will definitely go back to try their other offerings.",
