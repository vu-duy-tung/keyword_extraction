When the server brought us the check, she said \"the credit card machine quit working so you have to pay cash\", I said, \"I have no cash, can you run it manually?\". She said \"Sylvia, the manager, said to go to Food City across the street, they have an ATM\".  So I had to get in my car and drive in the middle of a crazy rain storm to get cash.  Had I known this when I first went in, I wouldn't have stayed OR I would have gone to the bank, get cash and come back.  I know my business means little (or nothing) to them, after all, I've only been coming here for only 11 years. I've seen some bad reviews for Poncho's on here because of poor service.  I get it now.  Sylvia, is this your idea of a back up plan? A good manager would come up with a solution that is good for both the business AND the consumer..If there was only a way to process credit cards manually.. hhhmmmm!",

Was Clinton just making a political stop or did he actually have some inside intelligence from forward operatives?  After eating at Poncho's, it was obvious that Bill knew a thing or two about Mexican food.  They have wonderful combinations and the restaurant has become a habit for our family.

First off, I don't mind driving out to a good mexican restruant, but seriously this place was so dirty, run-down, and as I could tell not run by good management. SECONDLY, and i could not believe this even happened, as soon as we sat down there was a full on fight between customers in the bill Clinton room. I had my phone out ready to call 911 because this fight was going on way to long.  It is such a small restaurant, with family and kids at just about every table. What kind of family restruant has a fight break out? A ghetto mexican restruant does. And not only that but the silverware, the pee yellow cups they use for water looks like overused cafeteria cups from the 90s. I think the only reason this place is still open is because the locals in South pheonix must not have any other authentic mexican restruants around. Anyways just so many things about this restruant is soo unappealing, i dont know why I even went. The worst experience at a restruant ive ever had. Not to mention we called earlier in the day to make reservations and they still seated us in the wrong place. Food was whatever, and service was below average.",

They argued and we paid and after we paid they said we already paid for the stuff anyways so we had to take. No way we are going to eat 3 open cheese crisp.

Well, okay, your bar is a site to behold and entertaining. Do I mean that in a good way? Well, if you like electronic juke box music you pay for to listen to while games are on various televisions and the crowd of 30 , or 60 or maybe the random drunk 25 year old hits on the said 55 year old in the dim lit area of loud ... sure! It's entertaining to watch ... while dining. #entersarcasm  I've not been woo'd by the customer service skills here ... ever. I have been here about half a dozen times now. The 'holding area' while you wait for a table is tight.. very tight. The hostesses are busy beyond words and barely greet you. We usually go to the entertaining bar, while we wait for a table. I told you, it's entertaining!! The one thing I do like here: the margaritas are good and they are strong. I pray the glasses are clean. I'm not sure. I just cross myself and pray, every time.  We recently ordered take out. Why? I am not sure. My husband was out and near Poncho's. He asked that I call the order in as he was leaving his venue. I tried. I was on hold for 5 minutes , the girl came on the line asking me to hold again. Okay , I said. Next, another 8 minutes. She came on again asking me to hold and I told her , 'I've been on hold for over 13 minutes now, can you just take my order?' She said , 'Please hold!' That was it. My husband beat me to this place. Insane. He said the place was nuts and one girl was running the 'take out area'. He got our food home. It was anything but appealing. It was disgusting and so incredibly greasy, I found it inedible. I thought the chips tasted like a fishy taste , which , in my opinion, meant they were cooked in old oil.. so I toasted them a few minutes. The salsa was watery. At least when you eat on property, the chips are seemingly fresh and so is the salsa. Our  meals : Enchiladas and chicken tacos , were literally swimming in oil. I refused to eat mine. Did I end up with a tummy ache later? Yes. Why, Kimberly, Why?!!! It tasted bad and it looked bad and you ate it?! Maybe I've finally learned this time!  I've eaten all over the valley and there are legitimately good Mexican food places here! THIS is not one of them ! Do I care the at ONCE upon a time President Clinton ate here? No. That was then and this is now. Maybe he didn't know truly good Mexican food and I'm sure they turned off that crazy electronic juke box that day and didn't have their rudest , curt staff waiting on him. The end , Ponchos. You are a big ball of yuck. Save yourself and if you want this level of Mexican food, go thru the drive thru at your neighborhood Bertos, those sometimes are actually good! And minus the jukebox!",

I wish that I was a little bit more hungry as I just ended up getting the albondigas soup. The soup was good and came with a side of lemons and tortillas, but I wish that they gave you a little bit more as it just came with three meatballs and a little bit of rice. It was not the best albondigas I ever had, but it was good. I ended up adding some of their amazing guacamole, sour cream, and salsa to the soup to make the soup a little bit thicker. Unfortunately the soup was a little thin and greasy, but again once you add some sides it makes up for the lack of thinness.   Our waitress was very nice and attentive to our needs. Our salsa, chips, and water were constantly refilled and I felt appreciated that I was there. Speaking of the salsa I loved the house salsa that came with our chips. It was full of flavor and had just enough heat to open up my senses. One of my friends ordered their chunky salsa, which costs $1, and you could see the chunks of tomato and peppers--very good, but sucks that you have to spend $1 for a small cup.  I checked out my friends food, which was a mix of tacos, chimichangas, burritos, refried beans, and taco salads--all which I sampled and were great. I just think next time I will come with a bigger appetite and try one of those entrees. I would come at a different time as the wait was a little long, but worth it. I will be back when I am in Phoenix.",

I had the red and green sauces on the side. The tamale was alright. It came out of the husk which made the outside a little drier than usual. The enchilada was better of the two in my opinion. And I actually like the salsa that came with the chips better than the red or green sauce - go figure. Also, the large margarita is a good size. It was much bigger than I expected.   Service was quick and friendly. And the prices were soo cheap.   I might come back and try some more things because my friend that I came with raved about the cheese crisp and burittos...and Bill Clinton visited too!",

The only problem I encounter when I go to Ponchos is the food is so good I eat too much.  On this visit my lunch companions and I  started with the nachos and chipotle chicken.  The nachos were delicious  and we could have stopped there, but we didn't and ordered our entree's.    My lunch companions ordered the Carne Asada Burrito, Carnitas Fritas, El Crudo Burro, and I had the Pollo Fundido.  The Pollo Fundido, was a wonderfully flavored, deep fried Chimichunga, with Jalapeno Cream Cheese on top. The chicken was tender and moist, the tortilla was crisp, and the Fundido sauce was perfect.  My lunch companion said his El Crudo Burro was delicious as well.  The machaca beef was lean, tender, combined with a light tomatillo sauce. The burrito is topped with red enchilada sauce and melted cheese, and  served with rice.  I think on my next visit I will have to give it a try.  The service at Pancho's is always great. Our drinks were always refilled and we were offered a take out drink as we left.   If you're ever in the area and craving good Mexican Food give Pancho's a try.",

The food is always out of sight, delicious, fresh and always on point. The prices are very reasonable and one definitely gets what you pay for. No matter what you order from their extensive menu, I don't believe you can go wrong. My ultimate fave at this place is the Pollo Fundido! The picture in my post does not do it justice . The white jalapeno sauce is to die for and illuminates my taste buds . It can get very crowded at times but it is definitely worth the wait. I have yet to have a bad experience with the food or customer service. If there is any \"complaint\" I have about this restaurant it's that it can get a bit loud with the crowds that are present at times. But, if you don't mind a lively establishment to enjoy tasty Mexican food, then definitely check this place out!",

We had pitchers of margaritas, too.  I could not move afterwards. I didn't get the full meal with the sides, just the chimichanga and even then we were in such pain because we ate so much, we had to go home. So, it's a lot of food.  It was really yummy. The margaritas are yummy, too, they do not taste very strong, though.  Overall, it was a good experience, minus the pain from eating too much afterward. I suggest NOT eating too many of the nachos they bring out beforehand.",

The waitress this trip was nonetheless unaccommodating when placing our order. That's also a reason why we stopped going in the first place. She ended up getting it wrong but, we didn't want to wait for them to get it right. I always order the Pollo Fundido and it was delicious. This was actually the first time I remember it being hot.

We came through the back which basically was the bar entrance and had to walk through the restaurant which was divided into sections and we had a hard time finding the front entrance. When I found the front entrance it was a small crowded hallway with a bench seat provided. We got seated within 10 minutes even though the host told another couple that it was going to be 20 minutes. That couple stepped outside and lost their place in line. The atmosphere of the seating arrangements were either bench seats or chairs. I ordered the pollo fundido which when I bit into it was excellent but after a while the chicken taste like it was from a can. The waitress was pretty good about filling our drinks but never asked me if I wanted another wine. I would definitely go back to this place to try other foods.",

The food is nothing short of fantastic, if you ever receive it. They are painfully understaffed 365 days per year and completely unapologetic about it. The fact that any restaurant thinks that it is okay to never refill drinks, get every order wrong, make you wait 45 minutes to get your check, ask for go boxes but never receive them, is just criminal.  I hate that this place makes me so mad because it has such potential. Goodbye old friend.",

    "text": "Hmmmm....didn't really impress me when i heard former President Clinton ate here in a whim on one of his trips in PHX. i was more distracted by this eatery being centrally located on a grimey street as well as the odd smell that greeted us in the narrow halls of the waiting area. It surprised me that the odd smell did not deter the number of people who were dining here. There was a brief wait time as this small eatery was packed in every room-including the bar's dining area. There was also a wait for the takeout line which they had conveniently outside...must be something worth yelping about....  So i decided to order what my cousin has been raving about-the chimichangas. I've eaten many a chimichangas before but never...a beef chimichanga... even with its regular guacamole +sour cream combo ever touched  the one i had at Ponchos! Simply stated-the overall meal came fast, FRESH & was filling. Now i understand how certain foods can trigger a massive release of endorphins throughout your body....i stuffed myself enough to put me in a food coma. Now i understand that i could never go back to a 'chain' Mexican restaurant again.   Affordable as is delicious-Ponchos proves that QUALITY of food isn't necessarily determined by price-as some of the best & most authentic cuisines are truly hidden treasures in local neighborhoods waiting to be found...thank you cousin for helping me discover this gem!  The menu may look very typical (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ponchosaz.com%2Feimenu%2F&s=b088a5683f6e3f5042f7bc1d87a851ed2e5749ecaf4f5d4281f106d0faa117d0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ponchosaz.com/eimenu</a>) but you'd only know the taste difference if you ate here & experienced it for yourself.

I've driven by numerous times, I didn't even know if was a sit down restaurant, because I always say a line of people ordering from the takeout window at the front. Craving some good mex food, I was going to hit up one of my regular places, but decided to try somewhere real close, and ponchos came up.. Walked past the line of large parties waiting to get in, they had some tables for one in the back. I walked past a very eclectic mix of people, bikers, couples, tourists, and what seemed to be a lot of regulars. The atmosphere, decor, smells and sounds transport me to a place of sheer happiness. The Food: I probably could have been served a tv dinner and still loved this place... Chips and a full bottle of salsa appeared seconds after I sat down. It took me 4 bites to decide that I liked the peppery salsa, but by the end of my meal, only a half inch remained, I realize this may be something I will crave if I ever have to go more than a few weeks without.  For my main, I chose the pollo fundido, as it seems that is the go to dish here. It really was fantastic. Not complicated, greasy, or light, just simply delicious!  For a beverage, I had a small margarita, which had no price, listed. When info the bill it was only $4.00 which was a nice surprise.  After cleaning my plate, I just wanted to sit back and enjoy the vibe, listen to the ranchero music, and pretend I was an actor in a Tarantino/Rodriguez movie.  So if your in town on a smoldering saturday night, you'll likely find me here indulging a neon green bowl o happiness and an empty bottle of salsa.",

The chicken was fried to the point that I could not chew it, and the veggies were covered in grease, and the whole thing was cooked in Soy Sauce! Is that traditional?? It was a nasty overall experience...",

Because it was so crowded everywhere we couldn't figure out what door we needed to enter.  We finally got inside and seated in the presidential room.    The doorways and rooms are so tight and clausterphobic.  Everytime I needed something I would have to flag down the waitress and I felt like we were bugging her.  The food was just okay.  I ordered the veggie burrito that I liked but would just get it from the take out window next time where it is even cheaper than inside the restaurant.",

    "text": "One of the BEST mexican food in the valley. Beans are the BEST. Enchilada's and folded Tacos are very good. Pollo Fundido is very very tasty. I usually stick to my usual routine: the \"Muchas Cosas\" plate: cheese enchilada, folded taco (i always get beef), bean tostada, beans, rice &amp; a flower tortilla. You can't beat it. I really like this place, although it can get very busy and customer service can be hit or miss, but overall they are all pretty friendly and helpful. My only complaint, not really a complaint, just a preference, is that I love the FLAVOR of the salsa, but prefer chunkier salsa w/ fresh cilantro. But the salsa they have is GREAT in folded tacos. The chips are good, but i prefer thicker chips, but again, thats just a preference.  They are ALWAYS busy, so get there early (or wait til later to go). They have a take-out window if your in a hurry. Don't even worry about the neighborhood. We just moved near south Phoenix from Chandler, and its fine. The ambiance inside is awesome and the hostess is normally very friendly.   You just can't go wrong here. A++++ food!",

We loved the service they use to have especially the little old lady that always greeted when you came into register check in . we didn't even want to put one star up but I guess you have to so you can write a review",

Then 20 mins after getting my drink she came and asked us if we were getting food. A couple of us said yes we are all getting food. She then continued to wave her hands in a circular \"come on\" motion. For what we took as a hurry up lets get this over with. So instead of going in an order we each just startes telling her our order. (Needing a refill by this point) she then precedes to take everyone elses order then walked away (still needing a refill) 30 mins later she brought us our food. We all ate (still needing a refill ) didnt bother to ask for a 3rd time for another drink. I asked for my check. 30 mins later i asked the manager of the bar i belive her name was Lisa. To get our checks she brings them back and they had things on them other people at the table ordered (if she would have went around the table  instead of a russian rullet style this would not have happened) i get my bill. I ordered 1 soda (free refills i did not recieve) and a dinner plate. On that bill was a gratuity of 8.00 i was pissed i was not going to tip her and when i asked why it was on there she smirked saying \"partys of 6 or more is automatic \" i told her she did not deserve thia tip at all and she said \"oh well\" .... tipping is for service. I did not receive 8.00 worth of service. So she took it as it was a for sure tip she didnt have to give good service being she would be tipped either way. I will NEVER go back nor will i tell people about this place. WORST EVER CUSTOMER SERVICE!",

This is a restaurant is located near south phoenix and the exterior is very creative and has the feel of a home. The interior is about the same as the outside because the restaurant was originally a home. I really enjoyed the food it was filled with various flavors, the serving size was perfect even though I had some left overs. The service was okay because our food took a while to come out and we rarely saw the waitress. However the food was well worth the wait, I would recommend trying it at least once because the food is not something a person should not miss.",

The building must have been an old house from the 1930's and converted into a restaurant.  There are so many nooks and crannys to get lost in.  But when you make your way in you are greeted by this lovely older lady who is full of piss and vinegar with a great sense of humor who leads you to your table.  We were there Sat. at about 2.00PM.  The place was packed with large families who seem to know the wait staff pretty well.  Everyone is so friendly and efficient which is a plus. Now to the real test.  The food is wonderful, rich in flavor and beautifully  presented.  Unfortunately, I am a wuss and order the same gringo dish (Chicken Enchilladas with green sauce)  Hubby orders Chile Relleno, tamale, combo plate.  The thing is those onions which are sauteed to perfection slathered all over the dish including the rice. This makes me real happy.  If you love onions this is surely the place.  It's a \"must go\" when heading up to Phoenix.",

Infact, when my father picked my mother and I up from the hospital after I was born, the FIRST stop they made on the way back to the rez was Poncho's!   One of the co-owners likes to laugh and say that she saw me before most of my family did! I went from being in a car seat gurgling as my relatives chomped on the best chips in town served with some awesome hot sauce that hasn't really changed since I was young. To being a little girl who always ordered the deep friend tortilla wrapped hot dogs with crinkle cut french fries and the BEST coldest ketchup I ever had!! To being a young woman who brought every single close friend I met while being away at school or through the native pageant circuit to enjoy the wonders that is \"The Works\".   My FAVORITE meal there is the cheese crisp as an appetizer, Combination #18 which is two tacos (i always order beef!), rice & beans. They have the best beans EVER!! And the rice is awesome too! I've had all the desserts on their menu and nothing really jumps out at me. I guess I still love the family tradition of going to the water & ice cream shop for thrifty ice cream before heading home!   I have had many experiences at this resturant. I've held my high school graduation party there; this resturant was the place where I signed a contract that made me the goodwill ambassador of my people for nearly a year; it was from their bar that I had my first LEGAL margarita on my 21st birthday, it was also the place where my then boyfriend got on one knee and asked me to marry him, and it was their waitresses who said \"to HELL with him!!\" when we ended our engagement.   It's a wonderful place to me, I like that I can go in and say \"Hi Marty!\" to their one time waitress who now manages the resturant. and have her yell, \"HI CHERYL!!\" Yes... that's right!! That's how long she has known me!! She can call me Cheryl and get away with it!! I also love the other long time co-owners/managers. There is one that always wants to buy a certain piece of jewelry off of me. And another who always laughes when I bring someone new in.   Poncho's is a place of regulars... LONG time regulars. and i think this is what every great restuant needs. Local, long time regulars who grow with the restuant. Who bring in new friends to enjoy the huge wonderful chimichangas or the Presidential Special and laugh over delicious enchiladas while a secret service agent (who kinda looks like leslie nealson if u ask me) painted on the wall watches on. While a bustling resturant does what it does best: offer homestyled, friendly, affordable and great food to it's old time regulars and it's about-to-become regulars.",

    "text": "They need to do better at dish washing, I get a dirty salsa bowl almost every time. Many times they bring the salsa bowl out with the salsa bottle (like a ketchup bottle) sitting inside the bowl, so the bottom of the bottle is inside the bowl after it's probably been placed down on numerous tables all day long, touched by everyone's hands, dropped on the floor, who knows, kinda gross. They also love to sweep their carpeted floors next to your table while you're eating so everyone's dirty boot dust becomes airborne and settles in your drinks and on your plate, again, kinda gross. The food is ok, kind of salty sometimes, and my husband ordered the chile relleno once and it was the size of a pepperoncini so I'd recommend ordering something else. Their red chile is amazing, the best I've had at any Mexican restaurant.",

    "text": "I have been going to Ponchos since the 1980's, it's one of my all three time favorites, I always order the three things I go there for because as a Latina I just love Mexican food. The Green chile corn enchilada can only be described as perfection every time the sauce is mild but tangy and the corn tortilla is fried to tender perfection in harmony with the cheese. The Chile Relleno is my favorite out ofGarcia's, Macayo's and Popo's  the chile is stuffed with I'm thinking a couple of different cheeses or a perfectly mild longhorn or cheddar, I think Longhorn. The chile is dipped into the scrambled egg whites and and fried to a crispy but fluffy indulgence. The green corn chile tamale which is usually a firm masa with green chiles and cheese was unfortunately runny as if it had been sitting in the chile sauce for a while. I believe it was a fluke, we went on a very busy Saturday night so that's what probably happened. The waiter was so fast and attentive bringing the chips and Margaritas quickly and kept asking if everything was ok. I will continue coming here for the rest of my life and I hope that you all will come to call it your favorite as well .",

My friends and I went today and the service we received from the waitress was no different than prior visits...poor! However, Louie should have been our waiter! He is actually the busboy and was more helpful than our waitress!! Louie took very good care of us...very simple requests our waitress didn't even come around to ask, more napkins, chips and one refill on our drinks.  So my friends and I agree....ASK FOR LOUIE!!!!",

The salsa is super addicting!! The chips are warm and taste fresh. I ordered the green chilli burrito with beef and it was so yummy! You can get rice and beans as a side if you wish but the burrito was plenty of food for me. It comes with guacamole and sour cream on the side. Delicious! There were several things on the menu I was interested in trying. Now looking at yelp, the pollo fundido is definitely on my list when we go next. Probably a new regular spot for my parents and I. Also, I will add that the prices are very reasonable. Check this place out. Bill Clinton approves.",

Tonight we arrived at 6:10 PM on a Wednesday. They had four parties in line, as usual. We waited 12 mins.   My wife ordered #18 which was two Shredded Beef Tacos, beans and rice. I ordered #11, a Relleno, Green Chili Corn Tamale and a Cheese Enchilada. We added two margaritas for a $30 tab before tip.   The #18 was very good. The beef had good flavor. The rice and beans: outstanding. I don't know if it's all scratch made but it sure tasted like it was. My #11 was very good. I love onions and the sauce was very heavy with onions. The Tamale was savory and huge. The enchilada was small but I still couldn't finish it. I haven't had a lot of rellenos so I'm not sure how it compared to others.   Our server was attentive on a busy night, so ole there!  Still highly recommended.",

You east coasters will get the joke.)  My overall opinion is that Poncho's is a run of the mill Mexican restaurant.  - my server was very nice and attentive (except for refilling my water) but the kitchen was very slow  - the chips were fresh but still very greasy  - the Pollo Fundido, one of their signature entrees was a good sized but soggy chimichanga with lots of moist chicken stuffed inside it.  It was then drowned in a white cream cheese jalapeno sauce.  All very salty to me.  - I ordered rice and beans that we're okay at best.  I know they are refried beans but these were also greasy.  Bottom line - with over 20+ Mexican restaurants within a few miles of here I will continue trying new ones vs returning here.  Sorry Poncho's!",

It's basically a chicken chimichanga enchilada style. The sauce on that smothers the chimichanga was the most delicious sauce I've ever tasted. I took a bite and couldn't stop eating. It's like they took all that was good in the world and put it in a sauce.   The chips were also very good. In all honesty, the first batch was good but the second batch of chips were a little stale. Still, a must stop for lunch or dinner if you're ever near South Phoenix.  I'm definitely going back.",

We left there 3 hours after having gotten there beyond disappointed.  First they wrote down the wrong name for us so when they called, we didn't say anything and they gave our table away.  We asked them the status an hour after being there and their response was oh well we called you, now you have to wait.  They admitted they just wrote a random name down and didn't even ask us if maybe that was our party. We finally get squeezed into a booth made for 4 people, we have 7 in our party....we didn't fit...shocker.  they got us another table and then took 10 minutes to take our drink order and brought us the wrong drinks. Our server was nowhere to be found and we had to tell one of the bussers to let her know we were ready.  By now we had been there for over 1.5 hours.  She takes our order and disappears again, comes back to take the other tables order and disappears again.  30 mins after that, she brings the other table their appetizer, which happened to be the same as ours, and disappears again.  Never once checking on us, no refills, no chips...nothing.  when she finally comes back with the food, we mention the appetizer and she's less than apologetic and says I guess I can get it for you for free.  Now, after over 2 hours of being there, our party finally getting our meals, she says to me, \"oh we don't have what you ordered. It's not my fault but you can get something else if you want\".  Horrible. I asked for the manager who decides she will just comp our food instead of coming to talk to me.  I left there, after being there for 3 hours, hungry, upset and frustrated.  I've been going to Ponchos for years but I don't think I will ever go back again.  Shame because I used to love it.",

Went back a second time and was not expressed with the green chili, had to many big pieces of onions in my chimichanga.  I really liked minced onions and these were Not minced.  Maybe they should warn you about the onions!!    The last time we went back the lady at the take out counter was not in a good mood.  we ordered a chimichanga with red chili and a smothered chicken burrito.  She told us it will be 45 minutes.  So we patiently waited for what we hoped was going to be good Mexican food.  45 minutes later we got our food and ordered was all wrong.  She gave us a chicken chimichanga instead of smothered chicken burrito and a plain bean burrito.  We referenced back to our receipt and it was not itemized, no details of what we ordered or what we were charged for.  It took another 30 minutes to have them retake and fix our order and then another 30 minutes to get our food. We waited 1hr 45min.  service was horrible and 8 dollars for a burrito that we waited almost 2 hours to take back home and eat... Will not be driving all the way to south phoenix for Ponchos.",

    "text": "Arizona is known for it's amazing foodie gems you can't find anywhere else.  Poncho's is, sadly, not one of them.  Wait! Hear me out. Before you ignore this review, understand that Arizona stands alone when it comes to Mexican food. Having eaten everywhere for Mexican food in both California and New Mexico, I can say that AZ's authenticity and flavor are incomparable. So naturally you would want to make the most of your dining experiences in Arizona and eat at places that have plates that leave a lasting impression on your palette.  Although Poncho's may have a quaint history you want to root for, it doesn't mean that their cooking skills are the kind you want to spend a good amount for. Just because someone says they're Mexican or have a Mexican background does NOT mean that they automatically have the correct method of seasoning, prepping, or even frying.  My boyfriend and I wanted a Sunday lunch there, and we were going in with an open mind. I was actually excited that I would finally try the \"pollo fundido\" that everyone talked about. We left a little disappointed.  The human traffic in the dining area is distracting. The setup of tables is a little weird, and although the warm paintings of desert landscape are inviting, the constant movement of waitresses, busboys, and families is...well, annoying. Then the food came. It was very, very, VERY inauthentic. The salsa for the chips was literally a tomato paste that resembled something like ketchup with some spices thrown into it. The meal was heavy; it was greasy and felt more like a fast food combo that wouldn't keep me full for too long. Great meals leave you satisfied, but here I couldn't eat much. I looked around and noticed that the crowd that ate at this place really didn't care if the food was bland or nothing close to the beautiful mom and pop shops that would put the food to shame. It was saddening and a little frustrating to know that they were missing out.   \"Can I be honest with you?\" My boyfriend asked.  \"I could get something just like this at Del Taco.\"  Mr. Clinton, if you come back to Phoenix, I can show you places that would blow your mind.",

I've been here twice now and the 2nd time I swore I'd try the Chili Relleno but I couldn't resist the Pollo Fundido. Finance was happy with his combo plate both times as well.   Can't beat the house margaritas, they are amazing.   Salsa and guacamole is awesome.   The location is a little questionable and intimidating, that is the only reason for 4 stars.  Food, drinks and service have never been a problem here.   I highly recommend Poncho's, we haven't found a single place that beats it yet.",

Some of my favorite dishes include the beef tacos, borracho burro, and the tamale especial. You can't go wrong with those picks. I also have to mention that their michaldas are so good but a bit on the spicy side.   Fridays and Saturday nights get busy so don't be surprised to wait 15-20 minutes for a seat.

The albondigas soup that they make is always too salty, and the meatballs are never fully cooked. I've ordered the soup many times in hopes that it will be cooked and they fail every time. I always end up putting my soup in the microwave to completely cook the meatballs. The tacos are extremely greasy, and the restaurant needs renovating. The chips and salsa is about all I will eat. I've been asked by coworkers on where to go for great Mexican food and I always advise them to go to Comedor Guadalajara. Ponchos is NOT the bees knees and I would avoid it. Sorry but they just don't cut it.",

Yet, good and filling, it's a burger at a Mexican place. Nachos would be a second choice, but they're really just mini, greasy, delicious  tostadas. I love them! Order the Small - you're not going to be able to finish it, so don't bother ordering the Large. Oooh, almost forgot about a picky kid's choice: a giant cheese crisp! This can also be an appetizer for a large group, just add salsa zigzags all over that biznatch.   Slightly Mexican inclinations? Their lovely,  giant chimichanga is what I set my standards to. It's delicious.   Margaritas are strong and the staff are friendly. Salsa is super spicy and chips crisp.  Grew up here and when I visit Arizona, Poncho's is always a must.",

I called in a takeout order at Poncho's, picked it up, then drove the entire crew up to Dobbin's Lookout atop South Mountain. (About a 10 minute drive from Poncho's on Central Avenue)  Yup. A seven-mile vertical drive up South Mountain chocked with enough mountain switchbacks to ensure your entire family will be car sick upon arrival, leaving most, if not all of Poncho's feast available for your lunch tomorrow.

First of all I had to wait nearly two hours only to get fed one of the rats they found out back. I \"ordered\" the chili rellano and it was so cold a Eskimo could have gave it to me in an igloo and it would have been warmer. I decide to look past it and just eat, and I get about two bites in and I find this sorry excuse they call a chili. I nearly threw up when I poked my beans, because it turned out to be brown jello. It was not worth the wait, nor the money.",

The Pollo Fundido has a terrible taste from the chimichanga being fried in very dirty oil. I could not get past the flavor to take more than 2 bites. The enchilada sauce had a very strong one note flavor - can't name what flavor it was other than bad. The shredded beef had no seasoning. It taste like they cooked beef in water then shredded it apart. Do not eat here, it's a waste of money!",

    "text": "How has this place stayed in business for 36 years serving the weirdest, unauthentic Mexican food ever presented on a plate? It might be because Bill Clinton ate here in 1999 and they are still getting food tourists? Not sure, but I did snap a photo of Clinton's table and that earned the extra star. The place is a mishmosh of small rooms and is old looking, but seemingly it retains its customers somehow, The guy next to us said he has been eating here once a week for the past 20 years and the waitress must have been here from day one. Have you ever heard of a waitress being too efficient, doing her job too good - kinda weird concept, but maybe somebody will get it.     Even though, waitress informed pop that the fajitas were cooked in Teriayki sauce (WTF?), she said they were good and he took the veteran's bait. Big Mistake because our regular told us later that they just cook the chicken in Worcesthire sauce. His plate was swimming in salty, black liquid, only one tortilla was given, the guac had no chunks and looked like green toothpaste and the original salsa served with the chips was a watery mess of slightly hot red liquid (nothing in it). The $1 chunky salsa was better, but still on par with a chain or something (no offense to the much better chains in the area).      My $9 combo was a mess covered in a tasteless green sauce. The enchilada tasted like stale tortillas were used and the green corn tamale was all fluff and no green chile or corn present. The chile Relleno might have been the best item, but they used a green chile, not the traditional poblano.      Pancho needs a break, a new menu and can someone mention to them how to cook fajitas properly because that crap should be taken off the menu forever. Clueless restaurant and even more clueless people who think this is real Mexican food. It aint.",

We waited for a bit before being seated in one of the small rooms in the back. We were given chips and the salsa in the bowl and promised salsa in a bottle. The chips were very greasy and not that crunchy and the salsa tasted like very peppery ketchup...ick. After 5 minutes or so we were given the squeeze bottle which contained a very similar, but slightly less tomato -y, salsa...not a win. For lunch, I had the mini pollo fundido and the BF had a taco and tostada. My food was alright, the chicken on the inside of the burro was nothing special, but the sauce was good and the rice was really good. Sort of what I expect from a cheap Americanized Mexican restaurant. The BF's taco was fine....also nothing special, but not bad. The prices were decent and the portion sizes were too large. I think it's super funny that they are clinging to the fact that Bill Clinton ate here 15 years ago or so, they have the newspaper clippings all over....I definitely lol'd. Anyway, I wouldn't avoid this place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.",

Makes it convenient for people who are traveling into or out of Phoenix and have that itch for real Mexican food. This place is always packed. The food is served piping hot, with great chili sauces and unlimited hot chips and salsa and is super affordable to boot! I recommend the Pollo Fundito - Marinated pulled chicken chimichanga that has a warm jalapeno cream cheese inside.. Not good for you, but tastes oh so good.. This place has great music, fantastic margaritas, and friendly service..  The one thing I do not like about this place is their Guacamole. It is unimpressive so don't waste your time adding that to any of your dishes. Lucky for us that we don't need the guac to make this place rock!  Side note...

Didn't ask us if we needed anything else or if it was all on one bill. When we told her we were paying seperately, she took off again and brought us back our separate receipts.

I returned today, excited for the same quality and feeling a little nostalgic.   Bleh. It was incredibly loud and every table had a crying baby. Don't get me wrong, I love babies, but every reasonable person has limits. Also, our waitress was awful. I'm not usually too picky, but she didnt once come by after our food was dropped off to ask how everything was. She was morose, made no effort to engage and everything we wanted, we had to chase her down for.   And we arrive...at the food. The zucchini appetizer is off the menu, big disappointment. My beef tamale was awful. I would have sent it back had my waitress ever returned. My chicken enchilada was edible but tasted like one of those frozen entrees. The salsa is still good, but I'm not about to drive down to south Phoenix if everything else sucks.   Sorry, Poncho's. You used to be high on my list but you've really lost a lot of flavor and character since my last visit.",

She asked me for my order, and once I repeated it; she said \"Oh here it is; sorry about that ma'am.\" So basically I waited outside for 30 minutes for my food that was ready and just sitting on the counter. She was so engrossed in her conversation with her co-workers that she forgot to call my order??

Watch out for lunch here during the week it can get full, its one of those place people know where to find.  Just of Central in South Phoenix.  I don't get out here that much  Destination location for sure.

Why are people charged more when you order something without rice and beans? Most of the time the amount of food minus the rice and beans is way more than enough. I can't tell you how many times I see plates with rice and beans left on them. They just get thrown away.",

I remembered Poncho's serves food late, so we stopped in to give it a try.   The place we packed. Hardly an empty table which seemed like a good sign. Service took quite a while, but there were several large parties around us, (one who clearly never heard of \"inside voices\", but rather \"screaming voices\") so they were busy. A simple \"hello, be right with you\" would have been nice though, as opposed to being completely ignored.  We loved the screaming child next to us, who the parents ignored and chose to drink many beers instead of correcting his behaviur. When he knocked some holiday decorations off the wall, the parents simply set them on the floor and went back to their beer. ( not the fault of Poncho's, but indicative of the typical clientele. I asked about beers on tap, and was told \"Bud, Bud light, Miller). Seeems like a Mexican restaurant would have some Dos xx's , Tecate or something, but no.  We asked how the quesadilla was, and were assured it was fantastic, so we had that, and 2 different combo plates.   Well, the \"quesadilla\" was simply 2 heated tortillas with greasy runny orange cheese. No sides, no toppings, just orange goo.  Our entrees were no better. The beans were bland and tasteless, and were the burritos.. It was like eating air.  The beef taco was HORRIBLE. I literally watched oil run out of it as i held it up. I voiced my concerns, but was just given a shrug by the waitress.  I used the bathroom, which was a wreck, dirty and no paper towels or soap, and headed out their door for the last time.  I have never understood how people can rave about this place, but they can have it. I won't be back.",

    "text": "First off, what the heck kind of place charges their customers $1.00 for the \"good\" salsa to go with your chips, puts them in a soup cup (not bowl) and no free refills? The free salsa tasted more like ketchup than hot sauce. To top that off, why would any mexican food restaurant offer you EITHER beans OR rice with your meal, not both?!?!? And then when you ask for both you get charged extra without them telling you!?!? WTF!?!?!? Food wasn't even that great.  I don't know why we came back. Service was not the greatest. Felt bad for the party next to us cause they got seated right before us and we got our food before she even asked if they were ready to order. Manager was chatting it up with another table and one of the bus boys came by and she said something to him and once he was out of the room started talking crap about him to the customers. Will NOT be back.",

Literally EVERY person in our little room got pissed at her. That takes some serious dedication to be that shitty. - the food was bland at best. The beans were ok, but the rest...wtf was that shit? - place smelled funky...like a highly perfumed turd - too many dumb-ass female managers and waitresses running around doing absolutely nothing. They all worked at one speed. It was like that song Despacito, but instead of wanting to dance, I wanted to throw a cup at their head and tell them to hurry the fuck up. - parking was good.",

ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE!!  There is no way a rock finds its way into a bean burrito by accident.  And when I say rock, I mean a dime sized pebble.  My family went to this restaurant at least weekly and would take our out of town guests.  I'm beyond upset and frustrated.  Customers have been lost.  Postmates delivery.   It was NOT Postmates with the issue as I have used them many times and the service is always great.  This is the worst service from Poncho's ever.  The order is never correct and is messy.  The To-Go staff is rude and unhelpful.  As far as food, they are amazing but they are about to lose my business for customer service and delivery.  Dining in is nothing special but not the worst.  They have the ability to be a rockstar restaurant in both delivery through a service, their pick up window and restaurant, but I don't see the attempt in moving that direction anytime soon.",

When they do they are short and put you on eternal hold and often don't even come back on the line.  We did a order today, cheese crisp was the small flour tortilla....they think you will not notice...but the pizza box was huge and a little tortilla inside with some cheese on it.  Took me 30 min to order then was told that if we did not 'prepay' we could not do this because it was over 25.00!  Have been going there and ordering to go for 15 yrs and now all the sudden you have to prepay?  If they have customers that are not picking up their orders, the entire population should not be penalized for it...especially the customers that are loyal. Make a list of names and phone numbers of the offenders for gosh sakes!  Don't upset your regular customers!  The girl I spoke with was rude and mouthy and kept putting me on hold.  We wlll be finding another place to go to after being loyal customers all these years.  And oh by the way, they don't make their own tortillas! I know who does and I go there for 1/2 the price they charge at Ponchos!  100% markup on the tortillas BTW!  The mouthy girl on the phone was supposed to get me a mgr to talk but never came back on the line, neither did the mgr!  Bad for business.  Ponchos, sorry but there are way too many good Mexican Food Restaurants in Phoenix.....Accommodate your customers and don't skimp on food, like a itty bitty cheese crisp! I also noticed on the to go order, our rice and bean were is small aluminum containers, used to be in larger ones.  Portions are getting smaller and smaller.  Again, they think we longtime customers don't notice...well we do! VERY DISSAPOINTED INDEED! *************************************** Updated review - I did finally get a call back today from Syliva, M-F Mgr. She was very apologetic.  She is going to speak with the kids that take the orders and remind them that the customers are why they have their jobs..  And also gave us a partial credit for our dinner.  She said nothing has changed and the portions should of been there.  She was amazed they used the small flour tortilla for our cheese crisp.  She was not happy.",

Maybe she was new but non the less anytime we asked her a question about the menu or drinks she had to go ask someone else. She didn't even bring out silverware for us when she brought out our food and we were always waiting on drink refills. It took forever to get drinks and order the food. I was starving by the time we ordered and i ordered the taquitos with bean and rice. The shell of the taquitos were over fried and  when you bit into the food it tasted like stale chips. My other friends got tacos and they said the same thing about the taco shells. On top of all that the credit machine was down when we were trying to pay . She came back and asked if we had cash and when we told her we didn't, she kept saying well we can only take cash so I don't know. We asked her if she could take our card numbers down and charge it when the machine was working again but she said we couldn't. She said they were trying to fix it so we waited another hour and half and by that time I was pissed. She didn't come back to see if there was anything they could do while we waited and kinda just forgot about us. After all the waiting she comes back with the credit card number on the receipt and told us to put the phone number on the back and they will call us when they are going to charge the card. Service sucked and food sucked",

The cashier went from 2 lines to one and there was no one informing people in line what was happening. Once we got the food back to office, it seem that it was not even our order as many items were different from what we had called in. First time and last time we will use this place for our Friday office lunch.   The poor pregnant lady working behind the counter was doing her best with out any help. The people that were there that had ordered were still waiting after we had left 30 minutes later after arriving at the location.   I do not recommend this place for orders that are for multiple parties or at busy times that means 11-2pm. Even walking in to order may provide one with a lifetime of frustration for ok food. Save your sanity and time and go somewhere else.",

    "text": "We found Ponchos by stumbling over it while looking for another address. It was lunch time so why not???  The short review is - just stop what you are doing right now and go there for lunch! You live in Tucson and it is in Phoenix? I don't care, leave early it's worth it.  OK a bigger review.  Big surprise!  First -- The parking area is deceptive - go to the back instead of squeezing into one of those front spaces.  Then - go in and ignore any line that might have formed - it will clear up really fast.  Now sit down and prepare to be surprised. I bet you think most Mexican food is just Lettuce Cheese and some meat arranged in different presentations with Salsa. Well that is True but Ponchos actually is a different taste and it is wonderful.   Chips - the chips are light and crunchy not burned, thick and greasy. You may well ask to buy a bag of them to take home. We did. Twice now.  Salsa - the salsa comes in a squeeze bottle and I was really skeptical because I like it in a dish  to dip out of. The salsa is best served like they do it and it is spectacular. Not to hot, nice tang and flavor just goes all over your mouth. They provide a dish if you want to put the Salsa in the dish. (get takeout to go with those chips you are going to buy)  I have now had Tacos (you just have to always do that) and Enchiladas. Both were an experience. My associate had the red chili in  a burro and  I tried it. You really should just drive there to try the red chili.  This is a small thing but I like coffee and restaurants frequently keep coffee around or do not have it ready. Ponchos keeps fresh coffee hot and ready, and it is good coffee.  My only issue - no Posole and I bet these guys could make a killer Posole.",

Time has certainly changed this place.. we started with a cheese crisp with green chiles, delicious.. nice and crispy with just the right amount of chile strips.. also ordered their killer chunky salsa which was as good as I remember it.   Then come my Pollo Fundido swimming, Im serious about this, swimming in a pool of grease!! They didn't even bother draining the thing before tossing it onto my plate. Was disgusting too, not even like clear oil but dark brown grease. Vile. Then the Misters Sampler showed up.. this thing was a fucking mess! You couldn't tell what was what under the piles of sauce and lettuce until you took a bite. Mini chimis were burnt, mini tacos burnt, tamales, cold and hard.. was a complete wreck.   After a few bites we called it.. major loss of appetite.. a shame too cause the salsa was actually really good but the entrees were inedible.   Meanwhile, the Mister was attached to the toilet within a few hours of eating here.. he was sick all day the next too.. so word of caution, eat here at your own risk.  Im sure going to miss the good meals I used to have here, what a real shame.",

I've been picking up food at least once a week from the take out window, lately it seems every time I go there is a mistake with my order, they forget food or give me the wrong order. Yesterday they forgot my abondiga soup, I had to drive all the back to let them know. When I told them they forgot my soup, the server at the window was very rude and questioned if I was telling the truth and not trying to get a free soup out of them. After asking everyone in the kitchen if they remembered packing a soup she finally just threw a soup in a bag and gave it to me. When I get home I picked up the bag and the soup dropped right through the bottom of bag, she didn't secure the lid and it spilled all over the inside of the bag. I called and complained to the manager, she gave no apology, and told me that there is nothing she will do. I told her I'd never go back and she laughed and hung up. They seem to always be rude as it is but this was the last straw. Food is over priced and the restaurant needs remodeling as the carpet smells really bad (what restaurant has carpet anymore?). So long, another long time customer gone! Guess I'll drive to the BEST MEXICAN RESTAURANT IN TOWN...Rositas Place on McDowell /24th street!",

I have dined in and called in my order and pick up to go service many times. Food always taste great and portion sizes are good. I regularly get pints of their salsa from the to-go service. I usually get a green chili burrito or red chili burrito enchilada style. Their chicken burrito deep fried is my son's favorite. It's big so he usually shares it. I reccomend you go try it out.",

Everything seemed to run a a turtle pace and it didn't seem much different than yesterday when I stopped for lunch.  I am not sure what the deal is but you'd figure they do better when it's not super busy...  Not a place I feel comfortable recommending for lunch or dinner...other guests waiting voiced being unhappy with the operation of this establishment.  On a positive note...the chips n salsa are excellent and the meal portions are good for the price.  Didn't get to visit the restroom here but by the looks of the layout...it may not much to be impressed with...  They have a nice parking lot...oh n I didn't get any utensils.",

The two stars is for the service - zero stars for food.  The food on the other hand....most of us got the pollo fundido. Eh. And I mean \"eh\" at best.  A few got the fajitas. I was expecting the tray of sizzling fajitas to come through the restaurant and make everybody's mouth water. Nope.  In fact...the people who ordered the non-sizzling fajitas said they were awful and tasted like they had been cooked in....soy sauce.   Overall....never been a huge fan of Panchos to begin with...I could never understand the wow-factor....there are so many other better places.",

Maybe it has to do with the fact that we arrived an hour before closing. There was something off about the chicken during this visit. It tasted very bland and the texture was very flaky almost like tuna as if it came out of a can.   My friend ordered rice but they gave him beans instead. We didn't make a big deal out of it since were not that picky but that just proves that they weren't listening while taking my order. They brought us warm chips in the beginning which was nice and they also brought an empty salsa cup. When we asked about the salsa they brought it. When we finished the first salsa cup we asked for more salsa and they said it would be an extra charge. We said okay and just played it cool because at least the first salsa cup was complimentary, right!! WELL NO THEY ENDED UP CHARGING ME FOR 2 SALSA CUPS!!! They were very deceptive. When we asked for a to go box they didn't even offer a bag. Service today could have gone better. I honestly loved this place but after today I'm not sure I'll be back.",

Went in May 2019, June 2019 and August 2019 and the food was AWFUL!!! Ordered two chicken tacos with side of rice for myself, daughter ordered the red chilli burro enchilada style. Both were cold, the rice was half frozen, the chips tasted stale and found mold in a couple of chips, the salsa tasted expired, tangy and smelled weird too!!! Did not eat anything and got up and left. Waitress tried to catch me but we kept on walking out the door. Walked across the street to Tortas Paquime and had a warm good meal in Aug. In May and June went home and had cup of noodles!!! Sure was better than what we where served at Ponchos! I hate to see Ponchos go but if the owners don't do something to fix the issues, change the decor and bring it back to life. Bring it back to the pride of South Phoenix, IT WILL CLOSE !!!!.....shame too, lots of good memories at Ponchos :(..",

We ate in a room that looked like it had been something else originally, with way too many tables crammed in.  I ordered a pina colada, and stupidly chose the large size.  Large is a ridiculous understatement!  This thing was the size of a fish bowl or something.  Not one of those stupid beta fish bowls either.  The large drinks mean business!!  It was pretty good too.  Everything we ate was really, really good.  I had the burrito and my friend had a taco salad.  Everything was great, including the salsa, but the taco shell was AMAZING.  So perfectly cooked and tasty.  It's weird to get this excited over a taco shell, but it's totally warranted.  So good!!

I don't wanna advertise this too much because I'm afraid that if too many people catch on, the restaurant will figure it out and put a stop to it BUT...Once a buddy and I figured out the secret to getting hammered on their margaritas for cheap:   Order a pitcher of margaritas with NO ICE.  They are OK with that!   You get 3x the amount of margarita, and they will still bring you glasses full of ice.  Go figure.  Winning, Duh!    I guess by reading these reviews that it's hit or miss with the food, but their margaritas are worth going there for, even if the food does suck on your particular visit. They are just damn good margaritas. KILLER margaritas.  Seriously.  Also, regardless of the food and other qualities that make a restaurant what it is, my take-aways are always based to some degree on how good of a time I had there.  If the food sucks, but I still have a good time, I'm gonna remember that and that's gonna be reflected in my reviews.  Maybe it's just the good company, I don't know, but at this place, I have always had a good time, and I don't remember the food ever being less than good.    Go have yourself a good time!",

The only thing edible was one miniature taco. Never in my life have I had a green corn tamale that I didn't like...until Ponchos! I can't even describe the taste other than to say it was NOTHING like a green corn tamale. The chimis were way over fried. The filling was disgusting....tasted like red chili powder. The \"chunky\" salsa was gross and I had to request it twice before knowing how bad it was. Maybe they can fool white folks, but this Latina wasn't happy. My roommate ordered the fajitas. No sizzling platter. The beef was obviously overcooked as were the peppers and onions....and it all tasted like teriyaki sauce...WAIT...where am I? Oh yeah, in a MEXICAN food restaurant, not an Asian restaurant. The rice and beans were good! I was praying the waitress would not utter the words, \"did you like your food\", but alas she did! My roommate immediately said \"no\", and this is a man who rarely complains. At least they did not charge for my meal. None the less, I will never step foot in Ponchos again! The food at Federico's on 35th Ave and Baseline is a 1000% better.",

The frozen margarita was very good and I had a bite of someone's tamale and tostada and those were both very good. The ambiance is more of what people go for I think.

You will probably only see your server an average of three time like mentioned in another review. The space is very limited it used to be a regular home which was converted into a restaurant.  You sit very close to the other table little space to move around. If you can ask to be seated in the first dining room area. The rooms in the back of the restaurant get very hot and uncomfortable.  They also have a bar if you like to eat around loud music.",

It was no doubt really cool to see the presidential room dedicated to Bill Clinton, but the food today in no way represented that prestige.  As usual with any Mexican restaurant, we got chips and salsa.Unfortunately, the salsa lacked the flavor that I remembered it having. For lunch, I got the Borracho Burro and got to try a tamale and chicken enchilada. The enchilada was okay, but the tamale flat out sucked today. It was pretty flavorless and didn't feel like it was made with any heart. My burrito was alright, but it didn't have any umph to it flavor wise... I could order the same thing at a lot of different restaurants in the valley...it was mediocre.  Today was a sad day because my visit today made it just that much harder to drive out to South Phoenix to dine here. It's not just the distance anymore, but it's due to a lack of desire for Poncho's renowned dishes.   I hope whatever happened here turns around, but I'm not the only one who feels this way, and that's a shame.",

It has been a many years since the last time I've eaten there and had a hankering for some good Mexican food. However, I was deeply disappointed in what I experienced. I ordered the Tamale Especiale with the  jalepeno cream cheese sauce. I know the sauce is the same from the Pollo Fundido (my favorite), but it tasted nothing like it. I tasted no cream cheese. It tasted like sour cream with chunks of jalepeno. Even the jalepeno didn't taste like jalepeno! The chicken was flavorless. I couldn't tell there was chicken in it. My mother ordered a beef chimichunga with red sauce. She complained that it was also had no flavor and got sick afterward. I hope this is a one time occurrence because through the many years of eating there I've never had a bad meal...never!",

Anyways, I ordered the my food and was happy with it.  It was very good.  Probably worth 4 stars in my book, but since I only gave this restaurant 3 stars your probably wondering why only 3 of you just said it's worth 4 stars.  Well the reason I knocked it down was because of the service.  Just not very good at all.  Our service seemed irritated everytime we asked for anything.  She only came to check on us 1 time during the whole meal.  We had to get up ourselves and go to the kitchen to get a side of sour cream and our own napkins.  I'll try them again to see if maybe she was just the bad apple of the bunch.",

I don't feel comfortable calling and complaining every time and i mean EVERY TIME, they forget something in my bag or mess the whole order up. I live in laveen and by time i get home I'm not going back for a mistake that happens way too often. Example: I go yesterday to get our evening dinner. Made it simple but we did order a lot. I paid with my credit card. Well i checked my bag before i left the window. Strike 1: half pint of chili i ordered wasn't in there, but they insisted it was. Oops try again. Strike 2:  I ask for my receipt, not credit card receipt but the food receipt showing what i ordered. Response to that was well ummmmmmm when you use your credit card the only receipt you get is the transaction one you sign. My response is no that's wrong i want my food receipt. She refused. Strike 3: when she closed the window on my face. WWJD? Walk away i guess. I had my hands full, my two kids with me and I was very tired. I'm over it. Take out window will not see me for a while. I hope Ponchos management looks into a customer service class for these ladies, because these ladies acting like that now at such a young age will find out real soon when life hits them as adults, that they need to be CLASSY.",

The hostess was rude and not welcoming whatsoever, an older lady that was waiting to be seated even made a remark to her about her rudeness, so I know it wasn't just me that noticed it. We asked to be seated in their \"lounge\" area as we were planning to have a couple of drinks. Once sat, one waitress came by to take our drink order(mind you we hadn't received drink menus) so we began asking about their drinks and pricing. Her response was that she didn't know, so I asked for a drink menu, she came by, dropped it off and disappeared. About 10 minutes later another waitress came by to take our drink order I inquired about a beer, which was not on the drink menu provided to us, and again the response was that she didn't know. She finally came back after she checked and we placed our drink order. We waited over 20 minutes for two simple drinks, a michelada and a Budweiser in the bottle. Unless they're brewing the beer in the back, I really don't think it should take that long for two beer drinks. But since we were sitting in the bar area, we could see what was taking so long. Clearly this place is a place of \"usuals\", because two ladies were getting in an altercation and other patrons from all over the bar area knew them by name and the staff caters directly to their usuals. One usual walked in and not even 2 minutes later, her margarita was ready for her at the bar... But I waited over 20 minutes for a simple beer and some tomato juice, that was not tasty at all. When we finally asked if we could order food, the waitress off the bat handed us \"to-go\" Boxes which was really confusing since we hadn't even placed our order. Sounds welcoming, right? When we finally got our food, it was sub-par, the usual Americanized Mexican food, nothing spectacular as people had raved to me about. About 15 minutes into our meal, the check was dropped off. We weren't asked if we wanted another drink, nothing. We felt we were being rushed out of the establishment. My friend who I was with was not happy and asked when she came by if we couldn't stay to have another drink(hypothetically, because we didn't really want to stay somewhere where we felt unwanted) because it felt like she wanted us out. Her response was that we could stay as long as we needed she had just dropped off the check for when we were ready... But we looked around, and noticed that no other tables around us had checks dropped off, some who had been there longer than us, again the \"usuals\".  I've seen another review regarding they felt their service was poor due to their race, and my friend who I was with felt exactly the same way. I don't like to make everything about race, but sometimes, it's hard not to.   All-in-all, it was a disappointing experience. I moved here over 10 years ago and always heard about this place, and when I finally had the chance to go, I was excited, but wasn't expecting this experience. I am a self-proclaimed foodie and a localist and this is a local establishment I will not  support again.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I really did not enjoy my time at poncho's like my friend described to me. We were visiting Phoenix for a conference so my friend who is from Arizona mentioned Poncho's to me as one of the best Mexican restaurants in Phoenix because President Clinton specifically stopped by for authentic Mexican food. The story sounded very promising so we decided to try it out.   The place was fairly crowded with a line about 30 minutes wait time. You could tell that the place has some history because the decorations are pretty old. Since there was a line, we felt pretty good about it just like my friend said. However, we started to feel differently as the waitress took us to our table through the restaurant. There was a very distinct smell around our table in the room. We couldn't tell whether it was the smell from the kitchen which was next to our table or the smell of old carpet that have been soaked with years of Mexican food. Regardless, what the smell was, it wasn't pleasant so here was the first impression. The menu provided some traditional Mexican food items, which were fairly authentic. However, the chips and salsa were underwhelming at the best. My main dish was again disappointing to the point that I didn't even remember what I ate. This was definitely one of most disappointing meals that I had for a long time. Personally, I will not recommend Poncho's to anyone and will not return to this place again.",

But a place who turns a blind eye to their customer being scammed by workers, everyone who pays with a credit card should know that you are at risk of your financial information being hacked. I would think the only way to get around this is to pay with cash or to take your bill directly to bar and pay in front of bartender.   I know realize that they never really cared about their customers, otherwise, they would have changed that dirty carpet by now or replaced it with hardwood flooring.   I know realize that when I walk in with my entire family ( which comprises of 3 adults and 2 toddlers and a baby) and they still consider this a party of 6 people and automatically charge me 18% gratuity ---even when the baby is not big enough to even get a kids meal for herself or drink. You are exploiting my family, your are stealing money from my family and I could drive 2 miles north to Comedor Guadalajara and get a better meal (better looking rice for damn sure) and at a cheaper price. By wait staff and owners who actually engage with customers and look like they want to be there (even if they don't). Comedor Guadalajara had enough sense and care for their customers to rip out their carpet decades ago. It's just unsanitary.   I write this comment with a heavy heart knowing that I can no longer bring myself to come into this place knowing that they do not care about their customers. And that makes me sad.",

The chicken tasted really old, or perhaps it was the kind canned like dog food. I don't know. The tamales that were my appetizer, were far from appetizing. It was like eating soggy dumplings. By the time I received my burrito, the service was as delightful as the meal. After tasting the vomitous chicken, I told my waitress that I didn't like my meal. She then asked me if I wanted to box it up to go. Seriously?! I asked another waitress(the highlight of my visit) for a manager and asked for recommendations. I must admit, this waitress was very honest with me (after I struck out with my meal). She let me know that the chicken and Carne Asada are sub-par, notified a manager, and removed my meal. So I'm thinking  why doesn't she speak freely to the cook? But that's none of my business. My secondary meal was the sampler. The canned refried beans were the stars. They really outshined the other beef jerky like, leathery meat on the tostadas.",

Clearly this made me want to try it. We all went Sunday after the football game and it was pretty busy so I automatically thought it must be delicious. The building itself is older and looks like they haven't spent a dollar on cleaning, or on any upgrades. We sat down to a sticky table and ordered our drinks, and ordered our food soon after. I got Albondiga soup and 2 tacos. When my soup came I asked for lemon which I never got and the albondigas were waaay overcooked, I had to use my butterknife to cut thru them. When the tacos came I realized I could have gotten these at Filibertos... Nothing special to me about this place. Overall the service was descent, prices were cheap but the food was well below mediocre. I would have rather driven thru some place. My brother deserves a slap to the face for even thinking this place was descent... This place needs to stop living on the hype of Bill Clinton and make some changes...

Yea... we weren't exactly on our A-Game... we should have split up into groups of 4 and probably got sat a lot quicker.  As it turned out... most of our group left and by the time they had a table for us... we were down to 5.  Of course, we had been at the bar drinking margaritas and beers and eating chips and salsa.... so we weren't terribly starved when we sat down.  The margaritas are very tasty... however, was a bit bummed that the Cadillac margarita was not served with the Grand Marnier on the side.  Oh well.  The chips and salsa were Right On!  Nice and crispy chips and the salsa had a bit of nice heat and flavor different from most salsas.  It wasn't your typical pico chopped salsa... this was smooth and liquidy... but don't let that influence you til you taste it.    Once we got around to dinner.... i had the albondigas soup... it wasn't very \"soupy\".  It had lots of rice and like 6 medium sized meatballs... I thought it was filling and tasty.  The soup part wasn't just broth... it had a nice light beefy-tomato-y broth to it.  I also helped the hubby eat some of his Muchacho Grande Burrito.  You had better be hungry when you order that.... it's freakin' huge.  There's red and green chili as well as chorizo in it.  The one knock I have on this place is the guacamole.... it's not real.  I ordered it as a side and it came out as guacamole cream.  I'm something of a guacamole snob.... i like my guac fresh with chunks of avocados.    A friend ordered the pollo fundido and it too was Huge!  and the Jalapeno cream sauce it came with was off the hook.  We dipped everything in it.  :)  This is a very local type joint.... love the local, family atmosphere.  The servers and folks here work hard and do the best they can to accommodate as many people as possible as quickly as possible.  It's not a huge place so expect a wait on the weekends because this is a local favorite.  :)",

Walked over said you ready to order?! What do you want to drink?! I'll be back to take your order. Almost 10 minutes later (literally) she brought our drinks then seemed shocked when we started our order and said I'll be right back. After returning she took our order one item was the chicken avocado salad - she asked what kind of dressing? I asked for the options and the were all awful. Ranch 1000 island and creamy Italian? For a Mexican salad sure sounds great. We also ordered fajitas when the arrived we expected a sizzling platter of smoky grilled veggies and steak. We got a plate full of liquid several strips of semi but meat raw onions semi cooked bell peppers and a tomato slice. The guacamole looked like brownish grey goop. Disgusting. We told the waitress when she dropped off the plate ideas not fajitas and she just said ok here's your tacos and walked away. Never to her from her again till our check arrived. We asked to speak with a manager who looked at the fajitas and said oh it looks more like teriyaki beef...wth! We had them removed fomrom our bill but the overall service, food and attitudes are plenty to keep us away.",

That said, I would get it again but would ask that they go easy on the cream cheese jalapeno sauce on top.  I agree with the reviewers who said skip the guacamole. They put jalpenos in it which totally overpowers the more subtle flavor of the avocados. They also add sour cream as well. It seemed to be so whipped that there were no chunks of avocado in it whatsoever.  Fantastic waitress and service! So nice and a great job!",

    "text": "Went to Ponchos while in town on vacation upon the reviews of locals who recommended it.    First, the setting.  The place seems to be somebody's old house, with 5 or 6 small rooms (bedrooms maybe?) off from one hallway.  Luckily, we were seated in what was probably the living room at one time.  The largest room in the place.  It really reminded me of Thanksgiving at my Aunts place when I was a kid.  Too many people in a dinky house.   Service was OK, we were greeted, drink orders taken, and a basket of chips with sauce brought.  Our server returned within probably 5 minutes to take our order.  Not overly friendly, strictly business.  I ordered the chicken chimi with red sauce, the wife ordered the same with green sauce.  Found out later the green sauce was loaded with onions (possibly the reason i had to make a bee line back to Walgreens for Immodium after arriving back at our condo). Both dinners came loaded with beans, rice, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce and tomato. A ton of food, which we both finished half, and left with to go boxes.  The Chimi did leave me wondering if they make them wrong back in Michigan, as it was not deep fried and crispy. Back home, what I had is called a wet burrito.  Any who...the thing was LOADED with shredded chicken, and pretty tasty.    I have always looked forward to trying authentic Mexican food in the Southwest, and was a bit disappointed that it wasn't  a \"wow\" thing.  Have had better back in Grand Rapids. Not that it was bad, just not up to the hype.  And yeah, Bill Clinton ate there 15 years ago.  Have always looked for an opportunity to say this on the web. Meh.",

We were served right when we got there (we came when it opened up) and our server was really nice! She deserves to be mentioned by name, but I don't remember it.... sorry! Anyways, the menu was big but not-too-big, of you know what I mean. I ended up getting the shredded chicken chimichanga, and I also tried some of the Pollo Fundido (spelling?) and both were DELICIOUS! Yes, the portions are HUGE! It is imminent that you will fall into a food coma, even if you have a full box of leftovers to take home. It was a tad greasy, but it's fried mexican food, what do you expect? In conclusion, I say that it's my new favorite mexican restaurant.",

    "text": "First of all, I love this place. I plan to come here regularly as long as I live in Phoenix. Before I go on to expound upon the wonders of my first dining experience here, I need to make a brief but passionate comment about the location of this restaurant. I agree that Poncho's  is a gem, but I think it does a disservice to the residents of this area to think of Poncho's as good *given the area*. Part of what makes restaurants like Poncho's so great is that they are family-run, with the passion and experience of many generations fueling their current success. In my limited time here, South Phoenix strikes me as an area that has a lot of heart and soul to it - a lot of the homes in the neighborhood have been in the family for generations, and certain restaurants here reflect this sense of the past and of community. I loved my first experience at Poncho's because it's such a great dining experience with real ties to the South Phoenix community, not in spite of this fact.   OK, that being said, on to the food and drink! We started with thin, crispy, perfectly salted chips with some hot salsa in a bottle - best starter ever! We ordered margaritas, and our waitress (who was really down-to-earth and helpful) asked if we wanted the \"big bowl\" ones. \"Hmmm, why not,\" we said (they were priced at $6.50, which is really reasonable). And we didn't regret our choice! They were a little sweet for my taste, but they still had a really great lime flavor and tasted pretty strong. Much better than the limeade Los Dos Molinos tries to pass off as margarita mix! And once we had them along with the chips, the mix started to taste less sweet and became the perfect compliment to the spice of the salsa.   When we first saw the prices of the food, we were shocked! It was so cheap! It's really impressive that the owners have managed to keep the quality and portions so high while keeping prices so low. Based on Yelp reviews, I recommended to my husband that he try the Pollo Fundido (~$7). I tried two a la carte items - the chile relleno w/ chicken (~$5) and the shredded beef enchilada ($3.50). Everything was so rich but so good! The fried shell and the jalapeno cream cheese on the Pollo were so satisfying, the enchilada sauce was really flavorful, and the chicken was moist. The beans and rice were also really good. We enjoyed every minute of our entrees, which we continued to wash down with the margaritas.   We left feeling full but satisfied, and we definitely look forward to coming back soon (perhaps for happy hour or to sit in the cantina, which was really lively). Thank you, Poncho's! I'm glad you exist!",

    "text": "Poncho's is one of the many places that you're tempted to not review because it means more people will come.  The place is already packed almost any night we go so it's not like it's a secret, and most everyone knows about how Clinton ate here when he came to town which gives it some good Mexican food street-cred.   That said, I still know folks who would go to a chain restaurant instead of driving into \"South Phoenix\".  They have no idea what they are missing.  First of all, don't confuse Pancho's with Poncho's.  Pancho's is a Mexican buffet place near the Rhythm Room where you raise a flag for service.  Poncho's is an amazing restaurant with roots in Phoenix that are deep and wide.  Poncho's was created oh so many years ago by a woman who made food and sold it from her house.  Food was so amazing, business boomed even back then.  They added a walk up window to the front of their house.  Then a few tables outside.  Then they figured they might add a few tables inside.  Pretty soon they realized they needed to move out and turn the whole thing into a restaurant.  Good choice.    I don't know how to recommend anything on the menu because everything I've tried is great.  In my household Chimi's reign supreme.  I'm a fan of a few of their combo meals. Close your eyes, point to the menu, eat.  That's my recommendation.  It will be good.    There is a back entrance to a lounge area where you can sit at the bar or one of their tables.  Full menu service is available.  It's an awesome place to watch the game on their big screen.  Everyone has been super friendly when we've been there.  The smallish rooms created when you make a house a restaurant can get a bit loud, but it would be worse if we were in one giant room.  Again, I've never been here when it wasn't hopping.  Tuesday, generally one of the slower nights, we had a 10 min wait for a table. It's never insane, but the biggest negative has to be their waiting area.  Or waiting hall I should say.  The door in is say 6 steps to the hostess booth down a \"hall where you can touch both sides with your hands at the same time easily - but there is a long bench on one side.  Since the place is packed most nights, that means a row of folks sitting, and a row of folks standing against the wall.  If this wasn't all close enough, new folks sometimes try to walk in and go up to the hostess area, or meet friends in the restaurant so they are walking down the middle.  That said, we have had some fun conversations while waiting.  Last Friday night the hostess (and older lady that I'm guessing is a partial owner) was busy running around and getting a drink, so young lady said to all the new groups that walked in while she was out, \"Well, I've been coming here since I was 6, so I'll play hostess\" and she started putting our names down on the list.  That turned into a \"who's been coming longer\" competition which was won buy a guy in his mid40's or so, we didn't ask, who'd been coming almost weekly since he was 4.   Funny how those tight quarters can lead to some pre-dinner bonding/story-sharing.    So on top of the friendly folks, the great service, the fun wall painting (The Clinton room, as mentioned below, does have a picture of him painted on the wall.  It also has a painted representation of where his secret service guy stood during the whole meal.  One of the bus boys heard us showing it to someone and he stopped to mention to us, \"Yea, and he looked JUST like that ALL night.\"), the amazing food, and the short from down-town commute - these are some of the best dang prices you are going to find for real sit down service anywhere.  Every once in awhile we'll get a coupon for $1/off a chimi and we often don't use them because the bill is so low it already feels like a deal.  On a recent dinner, for 4 adults w/ full meals - but no bar tab, it came to $37 AFTER a 25% tip.    How many other places in Phoenix can you dine with a President for that price?",

My dad ordered the steak fajitas...again with the soy sauce. I was with some vegetarians (I don't remember what they ordered) but they were pretty meh about their food as well. For the 9-10$ the fajitas cost, I was expecting a little more than soy sauce seasoning.  The actual place is pretty cute and they have various rooms that are decorated well. The service was ok. The chips and salsa were the best thing about the meal. I would not eat here again.",

    "text": "After having multiple people telling me this is the best mexican food around, I figured I had to try this place. I was no where near impressed.  The only upside was the salsa and chips, hot and fresh and the salsa had zip but a great flavor. I got the sampler meal and it was subpar.  I can think of multiple places better than this for Mexican food. Ohh well atleast I can say I tried it.",

    "text": "We came to this restaurant expecting great Mexican food, but left quite disappointed. Our 'baseline' Mexican food restaurant of choice is Los Dos Molinos and Poncho's is no where near as good (when comparing, service, alcohol, food and ambiance). The margaritas at Poncho's are made with a generic margarita mix, the flavor of the dishes we tried (Burros, Chimichangas and Enchiladas) was unimpressive and this restaurant does not serve any pork dishes! If you like medium-spicy Mexican food, then Poncho's is not for you. The only thing that's acceptable at this place is the ambiance (which is not enough or us to ever make a second visit).",

But this is a great little place that has dining inside and a take-out window outside.  It's a great place to pick up an enchilada-style burrito on the way home.",

I want to marry that sauce. My flauta was a bit overcooked, but tried other peoples dishes and they were great. I'm craving the green tamale right NOW. Best of all was the service. Very friendly. Definitely coming back.",
