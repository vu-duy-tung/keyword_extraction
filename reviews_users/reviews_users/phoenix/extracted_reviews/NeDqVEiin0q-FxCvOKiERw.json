    "text": "I'll flesh this review in more as I have more experience with the pizzeria but it's promising so far.  Fair prices, Coke products, nice decor and a very inventive Southwestern fusion menu.  I ordered my pizza well done. When I order a pizza well done, I expect a well-toasted cornicione and a stiff bottom that shouldn't flop under the weight of the toppings. Clearly, the pizza man has some ability because my pie checked both boxes and had a nice balance of a tart, savory sauce and mozzarella.  I will go back, which is the best review I can give.",

Thin, chewy charred crust on the pizza adds texture and flavor to wonderfully fresh ingredients, including Schreiner's sausage. Randy could not be nicer and the overall vibe was very welcoming!  A lot of carryout but there are several tables available. Customer service is very good! Food quality was checked by Randy or others up front.  Great place for a great bite!",

I've tried this flavor combo in pizza joints all over the place so I can fairly compare to say that they have their pizza down! I also tried the southwest slice with chorizo and queso fresco. I think I died a lil when I took my first bite because the explosion of flavor took my breath away. I'm really looking forward to trying all the amazing slices offered. A lil birdie told me they're working on some new flavors to come too so I'll definitely be coming back for more!!!",

    "text": "Darn it, indeed.  I so badly wanted to like this place.  The owner/operator so very friendly...the bar next door has the best bar name of 2016...so what happened?  My first visit was in the afternoon, just for a slice.  The crust was just odd, it didn't snap like it should have on the first bite.  It didn't chew like it should have all the way through the slice and the sauce was forgettable.  The sauce should not be forgettable.  I was certain that the slice must have been old, and really, that's the way it tasted. Old. I thought it was not a good representation of their pizza and that the next time had to be better, and a large pizza of my own creation would be the ticket.  But, same result.  The crust is not to my liking.  The more exotic pizzas they feature might be terrific, but I want what I want and it isn't this owner or that owner that will determine that for me, menu or otherwise.  Here's the deal: if I go to a function and someone has ordered that whimsical ham-&-pineapple pizza, I'll have a slice.  Why not?  It's a slice.  But I'm not ordering that as a whole pizza.  So, I'm not ordering a \"white\" pizza, or My Slice of the Pie's idea of an exotic or specialty pizza.  Now, to be fair, if you read these reviews, it might just be me.  9/10 (or more) love this place, so, again, it's probably me.  You go there, you try it.  I wish Randy well but he'll have to do it without me.",

As if a convenient location, outstanding service and fantastic food wasn't enough to be pleased with...this is on their wall. Double sold.

    "text": "Great pizza place.  Only tried it once yesterday, but the pizza was great.  They remembered the ranch, extra pizza sauce on side and peppers we asked for.     UPDATE:  reason for sogginess was because Uber Eats doesn't have pizza bags.  Updated to 5 stars because the pizza was amazing! Only suggestion is to use a thicker corrugated cardboard for the pizza to sit on when packed in a to go box.   The bottom of our pizza was really soggy in a few areas.   It really makes a huge difference when a pizza joint invests in a quality method to ensure the bottom of the pizza isn't mush when it's delivered.  Fix this and this place just earned its 5th Star in my yelp book.     We got the supreme and it was awesome.  Half of it was just cheese and we weren't a fan of that.   But that's a personal preference.   They used a lot of seasoning and some stinky cheese mixed in w/ the Mozzarella.   It's for our Son who likes plain stuff right now, so he wasn't a fan.    Again, more of a personal preference and am sure they'll make how we like next time if we just ask.    Used Uber Eats so didn't have a good line of communication with staff.   Next time we'll go there and try something different and ask for our really plain cheese pizza.   Manager did call me though, left a voicemail, and checked to make sure everything was perfect because they're apparently new to Uber Eats.  That was nice.  All was great so didn't call him back.    I have nothing but good things to say.   We've tried SO MANY local pizza places and are constantly disappointed.   So this place is a breath of fresh air.   Highly suggest giving it a shot.",

I thought we'd made a mistake and picked an over-hyped pizza joint. The owner said he expected a slow night since it was St Patrick's Day. He took our order, we sat down and the front door didn't stop opening and closing from all his customers after us!  Slow night?  Wow! Oh boy, was he WRONG!    Now, about the pizza. OMG!  We got a slice of the Al Pastor and it was delicious!  Great combo.  We also ordered a small pepperoni, sausage and cheese. Outstanding quality and crispy crust. The cucumber ranch dressing was yummy on our salad. Since I'm a pumpkin addict, I was ecstatic to see pumpkin cheesecake available in MARCH!  Overall, great food and cool environment.",

I was satisfied with the food and the service! Just wish I got buffalo hot wings that's my bad but it was good! I recommend this place indeed! Thanks for delivering I appreciate it a lot!!!",

The staff super nice and owner friendly and sounds like he is loving what he is doing.Has great ideas for future pies! Glad next time we go we can do a BYOB! Till next time.

Randy is pouring his heart into this place and you can tell in every bite. The traditional NY pizzas are excellent with a perfectly crispy yet pliable crust. But I have to say the real stars of the show are the southwestern pies....the Al Pastor and the Carne Asada are out of this world. Put down the phone and don't call those chain restaurants....spend a couple more bucks and call this place. My favorite in the neighborhood and possibly the world!",

We saw the menu for My Slice of the Pie and were somewhat skeptical given the non-traditional combinations and flavors, but I must say I walked away very impressed with the quality of the food and the fresh spin on something you've eaten your whole life.  We got a few specialty slices and when they were packaged up and ready to go, Randy dropped them off to explain the inspiration behind the items and the backstory behind the toppings.  It's great to see a new place in the area that is ran and operated with the passion and energy of something our generation rarely gets to experience - a locally owned pizza shop and someone who truly cares about what they are doing.  Keep it up, Randy!",

They are both amazing, nice crust that is slightly toothy in an perfect way and the topping were balanced and flavorful.

    "text": "2.5 stars.  I had this place bookmarked for awhile, and was in the mood for some pizza.  I was in the area so I decided to place an order for pickup.  I went with a 12 inch El Blanco, cooked well done.  The guy on the phone told me about 20 minutes.  I drove down there and arrived within 15 minutes.  Real cool dudes that run the spot.  Very friendly, courteous, laid back and cheery.  I paid for my pizza and they offered me a cup of water while I waited.  My pizza was ready about 10 minutes later.  I took it to go and here is how it was................  El Blanco-  This pizza sounded delicious!  It was a white pizza with a \"roasted jalapeno garlic olive oil\" base, and then topped with a four cheese blend, tomatoes, fire roasted artichokes, roasted red peppers, ricotta, garlic, basil and cotija cheese.    I pulled over on a side street and found some shade and decided to dig in.  First bite in, I really liked the toppings.  The artichokes, tomatoes, cheese etc tasted great.  Not really sure with the jalapeno olive oil base though.  Never had one hint of jalapeno flavor and no real \"heat\".  After I got past the delicious toppings, I was unimpressed with their crust.  I did order my pie \"well done\", and the bottom of the pie was pretty brown (not burnt, but much more well done on the bottom crust than on the top of the pizza with the toppings), but it had a super weird chew to it.  It was almost like they used too much flour in the dough and it had no \"spring back\".  It also had absolutely no flavor!  Almost tasted like it was stale.  I made it all the way to the crust, and that too was very weak.  It had some nice char on it, but once again, no flavor.  My favorite part of the pizza is the crust, and honestly, this was some of the worst crust I have ever had on a pizza.   I ate 5 slices (minus the crust...and I NEVER leave the crust), and wound up giving the other 3 slices to a homeless fellow by the 17 freeway.    Overall, I am glad I stopped by to check it off my list of new (to me) Phoenix pizzerias I hadn't tried yet.  The toppings and the friendliness of the staff were the positives.  The dough and crust were brutal though, and unless this was a \"one off\", I don't see myself coming back.  Meh!",

I had it bookmarked for awhile, but recently decided to visit since it was picked ROTD a few days ago.   Luckily, it wasn't a long drive for us and the pizzeria wasn't busy. We did come around 4pm on a Sunday. The owner is really friendly and he gave us menus to review. We decided to order a 12\", half Supreme Being (mushroom, pepperoni, sausage, green bell peppers, red onion, bacon, garlic and oregano) and half Al Pastor (southwest sauce, mozzarella, asadero, al pastor, red onion, pineapple, cilantro, some other good stuff...). On busy days, the owner stated he wouldn't be able to order half specialty pizzas, but since there was only one other person other than us in the restaurant, he decided to place the order.   Honestly, I really thought a 12 inch pizza (8 slices) would be too much for the two of us and we would have leftovers. However, when we finally got our pizza, the flavor was so amazing that we kept eating slice after slice and the next thing you know, we had 2 slices left. We really could of eaten the last two, but I knew I would get hungry later since it was still early so I decided to box up the last two slices as a late snack. Prices are reasonable - around $13-16 for a 12 inch specialty. Owner also stated that they offer pizza by the slice before 5pm - cheese pizzas are $2/each and specialty pizzas, I believe are $3.95/each.   Overall, I'll be back. I KNOW i'll be back because my stomach is growling so I think I'm gonna head over right now...",

I've spent many years of my left being dissatisfied by pizza players on the west coast. I stopped in here with no expectations other than a slice or two. I like my extra pizza, but cheese reigns supreme in my book. So, I ordered the NY-style 12\" cheese. Their wings also caught my eye and I initially ordered the chorizo and pear glaze, but Randy being the gentleman that he is offered me a sauce sampler and I changed my mind. Pina habanero with, blasphemy because Bleu cheese is the only real answer for wings, the green chilies and cucumber ranch. Holy shit. This was the magical coupling of sauces. The sweet heat from the glaze melded perfectly with the cool and refreshing cucumber. Magical is what I yelled at another customer placing an order. But, we're here for the pizza. How was it? Fantastic. Delightful. Cheese pizza can't be carried by toppings, so if it's off, you know. Baby, is it on. The crust has good flavor and is crisp, but still folds well. The sauce has that light Tang that you want to feel. The cheese has a good pull without sliding off. Every component plays well, as it should. How is it the morning after? It's a great morning pizza. Perfect for watching the sun rise over the mountains. Will I try other pizza places in Phoenix? Yeah, but they will be compared to here. I want to buy a tophat just to tip it to everyone here.",

It's almost unfortunate those are so good... I don't think I'll ever have a chance to try everything else they make.   For a bonus, have them deliver the slices next door to Whining Pig for pizza and beer (or take advantage of what they have on tap right there).   Phoenix has a pretty great upscale/brick oven pizza scene (yeah yeah Bianco is great) but a serious dearth of good slices on the quick. Having lived in Tucson and Flagstaff, I have been looking for my Nimarcos, Brooklyn, Empire pizza substitute here in Phoenix. And now look no further. Now I just wish we had one in South Scottsdale!",

Good tomato flavor and perfect spice in the sauce. Usually with other pizzas I put more seasoning and parmesan cheese but this doesn't need it. You may want to ask for red pepper chili's if that's your thing?  Remember, a real N.Y. style slice has lots of grease to drain. So if you take out, throw that box in the garbage because I highly doubt it can go in recycling.  There are plenty of other adventurous choices and delicious looking desserts. I cannot comment on because I haven't tried them.  While waiting for take out pizza some months back,  my friend and I observed excellent, attentive service to seated guests.

I tried the Al Pastor pizza and it tastes sort of like a taco on a pizza dough. It was pretty damn good. They sells slices of each pizza so if you didn't want to bring home an entire box you have that as an option.   They have so many creative flavors that I'll have to come back and try. I do wish there pizza was a little thicker and that their crust was a bit softer. The crust was a bit hard to bite into.",

    "text": "This 4.5 star joint really doesn't need my review but it's my first time back since movin to the burbs and had time to kill while waiting for my slices and beer so lemme give you the scoop.... Unassuming take out mom and pop pizza joint at the corner of a complex behind bosa donuts. NY style crust huge slices fresh toppings more creative specialty pies than your own grandma could imagine and with plenty of Southwest flair. I got an al pastor slice and  a carne asada slide. Not a tomato base but plenty of sauce. Both had cilantro onion and crumbled cheese. They both had cheese melted on top and the al pastor had a green sauce drizzled on top. Neither were very spicy but definitely flavorful.  This was my first time coming since they have beer on tap. Almost ten different taps from Mexican to local. They also have canned cocktails. I always hear people talk about the cheesecake but I haven't had it yet. On the community high top table there are built in checker boards with pieces to keep you or your kids busy. There are two decent size tv's mounted up on the wall tables to seat 20-30 at most.",

When you walk in, the shop itself is unassuming (small restaurant with a giant mural on the wall and a chalkboard menu up front), however when you get to the nitty gritty of it all, it has just what you are looking for: d@mn good pizza!  We ordered the Supremo, which sounded different and amazing, and is was.  The crust was nice and crispy, and it was topped off with chorizo, chicken, green chili's, roasted corn and a southwest sauce.  Holy yum!!  It was unlike any other flavor combination I've had on a pizza, and I cannot wait to order it again for another go at it.    If you're in the neighborhood, it's definitely worth checking out My Slice of the Pie for a slice....or 2...or 3....",

I tried one regular slice - with meatballs, and one southwest cheese slice. The regular sauce is really good, and the meatballs were not bad! The southwest sauce had a really interesting flavor - makes me want to go back and see how it blends with various toppings. The crust was pretty darned good, too!  The owner is a really cool guy (and a legit east coast accent :-)), and the guy working the front was friendly and helpful as well.  Make sure you check out the checkerboards that are built into the high-top 'community table' in the middle - neat idea!",

I was working in the area, used Yelp to find a place nearby. Arrived.   Really great staff- Randy is awesome!!! I tried something simple- just a slice with pepperoni. They cook the pizza with the cheese first, then add toppings, recook- this way everything is yummy and delicious. They had the proper amount of sauce, stellar cheese and overall great flavor.  I hung out for a bit and Randy brought out a meatball for me to try- so good. I can be pretty picky about this whole pizza situation, so I was surprised I was so impressed.   They also cater! I put an order on for 20 people for the following day. Randy was punctual ( huge deal for me), and the food was great. The location I delivered to was blown away that they delivered all the way to Avondale. They all loved the food.  They do some southwest style pizzas. They use a cream type habanero sauce base. Not too spicy. Awesome! They also do an El Pastor style pizza. Killer!! Try it. I ordered a large as part of the catering order- it was gone in a second. Great flavors and not gimmicky.  The salads were very good too. I cater tons and have to eat lots of sub par salads that just seem to come with the meal out of obligation. The antipasto salad was very flavorful. Each bite was yum- if I wasn't trying to sample all the varieties of pizzas that I ordered I could have easily eaten just the salad.   Can't wait to eat here again. Awesome place.",

We discovered My Slice of the Pie after getting a flyer put on our door and it was a match made in heaven. Its so nice to have a good 'ole pizzeria around the corner. The pizzas are all delicious and we love the creative combinations. Sandwiches are hearty and extremely filling. The owner, Randy, answers the phone and always greets you with a smile.

Their banner hangs way low and you have to duck under it to enter. It was kind of fun, but then you are hit with a wall of writing that is all kind of run together..  ordering was a little confusing, but no big deal.  Our \"to go\" pizza came out in a timely manner, and the chef proudly displayed it to us. It looked good, couldn't wait to get it home.... Here comes the real sad face part... the first bite was a little burned tasting so I flipped it over and yuk.. the whole bottom was burned. Keep in mind we just paid 25 dollars for a pizza and the crust was inedible. We ate the top and moved on.  Probably could have went back and asked them to redo it but, but life is short and my time is worth more than that. We just will pass on this place and hope the new one they are building down the street can do better.",

Here's the timeline:  12:40 - initial order placed.  1:30 - first pizza arrived, wrong. 2:50 - received correct order.   The pizza itself was okay at best. Lots of toppings, which is good. We ordered The Supreme Being, no black olives. It tastes like a Papa John's pizza with better quality toppings. The crust, however, is very chewy and pretty much inedible.

    "text": "This is a pizza place worthy of eating for dinner and then polishing off the box during a drunken stupor later that night. I've ordered a small one at the pig's meow next door before and been delighted to enjoy take out pizza at the bar.   We ordered this for our office today. We got the Al Pastor, the Veggie, and Cheese. On the side we got the salad with green chili dressing. Amazing! Huge salad for only $6.   The veggie pizza was a little soggy but such is the case with the majority of veggie pizzas. Amazingly filling - one slice of the large veggie and I was satiated.   I can't wait to go back and make my own combination. I might ask for the pizza extra crispy, but I like it that way!",

I tried the southwest style pizza sauce version that they have, on two slices of their specialty pizza. Barb- Ba-Que-Onda, and the Al Pastor What? Great combination of flavors.  I also really enjoyed the crust, crisp but not overly firm. He also brought out a plate with all of the homemade sauces on it so that I could taste them. They were all really good.  Highly recommend trying it, and I look forward to going back and trying the traditional New your style Pie as well.  Did I mention good lunch specials as well, and a complete catering menu.  Good stuff",

    "text": "So I had a craving for some pizza and wanted something in the area.  I checked Yelp and it lead me to this establishment.  I've read some of the reviews and wanted to give this place and try and I'm very glad I did.  So I work in the biltimore area, there are a lot of good places for lunch, but not a lot of options for slices of pizza, cause who's gonna smash a entire pizza during  their lunch break.  So my buddy and I stopped by today for some pizza.  I asked the worker up front what does he recommend, and he told us we should try the Al Pastor What and the Carne Asada pizza in which we both did.  The pizza was delicious.  I've had pizza all over the country, but haven't sampled these flavor profiles I was getting from these slices of pizza.  They are pretty damn awesome.  The slices are NY style and can hold all the ingredients well.  The crust was still crispy and had a nice chew to it.  Very pleasant on the palate.  My co-worker and I were very impressed and highly recommend this place.  On top of it, the customer service was outstanding.  My co-worker is allergic to avocados and requested no guacamole on the pizza, well they accidentally serve him the pizza with it, but they quickly offered him a new slice for the error.  The manager walked around and checked on the guest and even offered to refill the patron's soda's.  In conclusion, I would highly recommend this place for awesome and very flavorful pizzas!  i can't wait to stop by this weekend and bring a pie home for the football games!  Great food and awesome friendly customer service!",

We ordered a 12\" El Blanco pizza, very tasty and hard not to eat all at once and side salads... the green chili ranch dressing is delicious and definitely a must try if you like the ranch style varieties.  Dessert - oh my, we had the raspberry jalapeno cheesecake, so good so crave-able - another must try if you like savory/sweet combination. Had a little sting to it but that didn't stop us from polishing the plate.   On top of all this delicious food is one of the friendliest owners. Randy was very attentive, gave us samples and kept our drinks filled.   Will definitely go back and try the Al Pastor and the Carne Asada and the wings.",

The sauce on the pizza reminds me of my mama's sauce and the grilled toppings make it even better. I am curious about the dessert I saw a woman order what I believe was a raspberry cheesecake, it looked fantastic, will need to try more than just the pizza, I guarantee I won't be disappointed with other items here!",

    "text": "We stopped here one night after I noticed that they were the \"Hot New Trending\" business on Yelp! We walked in on a Sunday about 30 mins before closing and received (IMHO) stellar service.  We were greeted by the owner who was patient enough to give us an overview of the selection process and the toppings (not every topping is self explanatory; he's got a varietal of meats and sauces and could suggest what works best together). After we ordered, our slices arrived about 15 mins later and it was well worth the wait. The artwork on the wall tells a story of it's own which will have you staring off while you chomp down on your meal.  There is no way to come up short in a place like this. The options are in abundance from the toppings to the sauces. You drive what goes in your mouth here. Either select from a creation on the wall or craft your own masterpiece.   It was definitely nice to buy slices vs. an entire pie, even though you have can do that as well. Doing so allowed us the chance to explore their menu options without the commitment of an entire pie. Mr. B. and I love pizza and will definitely keep My Slice of the Pie on our list of contenders.",

The staff were very friendly and patient while we decided what to order.  Since they don't serve beer, they informed us that we could go to the pub next door and bring it in while waiting or eating.  We took them up on it.  We ordered a 12\" pizza with bell peppers and sausage on one half and just cheese on the other half.  Also added was extra cheese to the whole thing.  The pie came out piping hot as we just finished our game of table top checkers.  The toppings were very good but the crust is a little too tough to chew for my tastes.  Not sure if that's the style or not.    That said we would try them again maybe ordering a larger pie to see if that bit of dough can be stretched just a little farther.  Give them a try!",

    "text": "My boyfriend loves pizza, it's pretty much his only food group so when a new pie place opens up in our hood we are there.   Our trip here was actually very entertaining.... More on that in a minute. We ordered a fairly run of the mill half cheese and half pep and mushroom. There are a lot more adventurous pizzas on the menu here, but we kept it simple. I also ordered a small ceasar salad and a mexican coke.   Randy, the owner took our order, he is full of personality just like the murals on the walls. He explained his cooler wasn't working very well so my Coke would not be real cold...no problem... he offered me a cup with ice, and the Coke was delicious.   We took a seat at table and Randy came over to explain they were out of romaine for the salad and it would take him 8 minutes (8 not 10) to go get some....and out the BROKEN door he ran..literally.   Yes, the BROKEN door, for the next 8 minutes my boyfriend and I laughed as people came in and out of the broken door and it squealed like a haunted house...it has wood where glass should be...and never quite shuts properly. Each person would try to fully shut what should be self closing door only to have it suddenly lurch back open at them and squeeeeeek in their face in the process. Very fun people watching. This happened over and over and had us laughing in our seats.  There was a pretty steady flow of people in and out on Friday night.   8 minutes passed, seemed like 5 but I'm sure it was 8 and Randy flew back thru the broken door and into the back room with Sprouts bags full of romaine (no Food City romaine here) and soon enough we had a pizza and Caesar salad at the table. The pizza was good the ingredients were very fresh, is it on par with the pizza at LGO, North, or Nook....ehhh.... but it was a pretty good pie. Again we weren't very adventurous on our choice. The salad was tasty, although it was lacking a Caesar essential... croutons... but the dressing and shaved parm was nice and the romaine was fresh obviously.... it was 8 minutes old from Sprouts.    The service was obviously excellent, and the door was just plain entertaining. Thanks Randy, we will be back! Don't fix the door it's part of the charm!",

    "text": "This is a brand new hip neighborhood pizza place that opened up in the the little corner spot tucked behind Bosa Donuts that previously housed an Italian pizza place that had been around forever, but in decline for awhile. This space has been thoroughly scrubbed and jazzed up with new paint and furniture and a cool wall mural.   I don't think they've even had a soft opening yet, but they were serving food and nice as can be. This is a family owned place, and it's definitely designed to cater to the Arcadia area. The owner clearly has had previous restaurant experience.   The menu has the sort of standard fare you would expect from a pizza restaurant, but they have managed to stick in a lot of interesting twists for each category. So you can eat traditional or find something new. There's a lot of creativity behind the menu, and many of the clever dishes sound delicious.   I only had time for a slice, and since I'm boring, I had a traditional pepperoni and sausage. It came out quickly, but also piping hot and fresh - it certainly didn't taste like a slice that had been sitting around. The crust was airy and light. It was also flavorful and crispy. The sauce was very distinct and flavorful as well. Toppings were top quality - right down to the gooey stringy cheese.   I'll certainly be back. I'm told they will be offering delivery eventually.",

Since it was a Thurs night at 8 pm there were lots of open tables and we could have seated about 25 people if needed.   The giant mural on the back wall makes for a fun atmosphere. They also have a TV showing sports events, but it didn't hinder conversation.  The pizzas were outstanding. We had \"The Veg\" in the 18\" size and for the kids we did half-and-half cheese and pepperoni in the 18\" size. The kids also enjoyed the gourmet cheesecake selections.

I'm from the East Coast and it was the closest to the way I would get pizza back home.  It was definitely not as expensive as home.  I would expect to pay maybe $15 for a pizza, but here it would be much more than that.  They were also missing many topping for those with certain diets.  Either way, it was the best, by far in Central Phx.  Definitely 4.5 stars.",

The customer service has always been friendly, the ambiance is relaxed and typical of a little pizza shop, and the pizza is outstanding! They're tucked away in a little strip mall just east of 36th St off of Indian School, slightly behind BoSa Donuts.  My pizza go-tos are the Supreme Being (red sauce, cheese, mushroom, pepperoni, sausage, bacon, green pepper, red onion, black olive, garlic, and oregano) and the Veg (red sauce, cheese, mushroom, green pepper, tomato, red onion, garlic, basil, ricotta, and oregano), but I've also loved the plain pepperoni, and a combo of sliced sausage and pepperoncini rings was a little spicy and super tasty. Their crust is a great texture, perfectly chewy and crisp, with good flavor. I've also had their jumbo chicken drumettes (chicken legs, essentially, but very delicious) with the BBQ mole sauce. Someday I may branch out and try a salad or sandwich, but for me, the pizza is where it's at. Give them a try! You won't likely be disappointed.",

Pizza is thin and crispy, topped with delicious fresh mozzarella and a tasty not over bearing sauce.   Their wings left a bit to be desired but next time I'll just try one of their amazing sounding sandwhiches instead. The wings weren't as crispy as I like and they were a bit skimpy with the sauce, but all the different dipping sauce options are delectable.  The location itself is spacious, situated nearly behind a Bosa donut shop, in a large strip mall. Many of the tables include a built in checkers board so the wait for dining in flies by. Their menu is written on a large chalkboard behind the bar and to the side, its definitely overwhelming with all the delicious culinary options to try from. Without a doubt some of the best pizza in town, especially in Arcadia.",

They pile on the toppings and there are all sorts of fun pizzas including some southwest style pies with a spicy sauce.

Not only was the pizza delicious (and unique!) , the customer service was even more impressive.  I had a special order and it got slightly miscommunicated but they were so quick and helpful to fix (and I actually got more than I paid for) the small flub. Ill definently be back! Try the El Pastor!",

We tried the Al Pastor (and a small pepperoni) and both were good.   The place is cute, tucked back in a strip mall, my reason for 4 stars is the wait time. It was very very slow and others were in there who seemed to be having the same experience. Since it was our first visit I don't know if this is normal and would absolutely visit again - but do so knowing it might take a lot longer than advertised.",

The Pizza was really good, with fresh ingredients, and it's larger than their competition at LGO and Nook for about the same price. I'd get in there now before everyone realizes how amazing this place is and you have to wait... the dining room is on the smaller side and they don't serve booze, but they are only a few doors down from The Pigs Meow and I have it on good authority from their ownership their that you can bring these delicious mouthwatering pies into their bar.     They say New York style, but the staff and ownership are way to nice to be New York, \"style\". The wait was gonna be a little long on our pie so the owner(I think he was the owner) gave us a slice of cheesecake... DAMN it was tasty, and local to boot.    I will be going back and I'm happy to say that this is defiantly one of the best pizza places in Phoenix and probably my favorite now.",

The pizza had good flavor, but the crust is nearly impossible to bite through or even chew because it is SO chewy! She isn't a big crust eater, but I am, and even she thought the crust was difficult to eat. Of the three pieces I've eaten so far, I eat the pie and toss the crust because it just isn't worth breaking my teeth. Two fairly small pizzas for $32 and they were less than perfect - not sure we will order pizza from here again. :(",

It came out hot and fresh, there was plenty of sauce and cheese and the taste was spectacular. You can tell that these folks use quality ingredients. The crust was nice and crunchy with just enough chewiness to make it something special.  Because I felt like I had to try it I got the AL PASTOR WHAT? Pizza to go and was blown away. It's full of flavor and had some sweet and spicy qualities; not to mention all of the ingredients were absolute quality. This place is new but the pizza tastes like they've been around for years.

    "text": "I finally found a Pizzeria that is worth going to in Phoenix. Being from New Jersey I hold pizza to a very high standard and this reminds me of all the great pizza joints in Jersey and NY. I had their two specialty pizzas and you can tell they have quality cheese along with homemade sauce. Also I talked to the owner and he was a very down to earth guy I will definitely be going there twice a week. Also their ooey goey cake is the best cake I've ever had even better than maestros butter cake... and yes I said it's better than their butter cake",

    "text": "PSA: THIS IS NOT YOUR AVERAGE PIZZA JOINT!   AND i'm absolutely obsessed with it.   My husband and I live SO close and JUST NOW made it in. I'm kicking myself for taking so long! We had the pleasure of meeting and chatting with the passionate owner about his journey as a small business owner and how he came up with this remarkable concept. We left SO inspired. He is truly an amazing guy!  No onto the food! To start, we split the Against-Pasta salad and it was SO delicious. Extra crispy and COLD lettuce with meats, cheeses, GRILLED in-house artichoke hearts, cucumbers, red onion, green peppers, and black olives. It is a BIG salad so I highly encourage splitting it if you're getting pizza too (which duh, you better be getting pizza too!).   I ordered a slice of their Carne Asada pizza because I had planned on eating more salad (trying to be healthy, you know - this whole new year, new you thing is really getting to my head!). ;) And after the first bite, I wished that we had ordered an entire pizza. YOU GUYS - the carne asada pizza is literally one of the best things ever! Do yourself a favor and get it. There were so many tasty ingredients on top that I can't even begin to list them all but trust me, you'll be obsessed too. THE CRUST. That was one of the best parts. It was the perfect combination of crispy and chewy, with a little char on it. YES. I LOVE that they incorporate so many unique sauces and flavors when coming up with their pizza combinations.   DANG, MSOTPP, you're onto something! We can't wait to come back!! We'll definitely be getting a slice of that cheesecake next time, too!",

The best aroma kept coming out of the pizza box on our way home and my hubby couldn't help himself. He immediately gave it the thumbs up and was upset we didn't order a bigger pizza pie.  This place is now one of our favorites!",

The guy that took our order acted as if he was an owner and had a great pride in the food and service, ensuring that he answered all of our questions, offered suggestions, and provided everything we needed to have a delicious meal. We started with the garlic cheese bread, a great sized portion that came with a side of red sauce. We tried the al pastor and carne asada specialty slices as well as a pep and sausage slice. Each was very flavorful, large in size, and reasonably priced. I can't wait to go back to try the homemade meatballs, if they are half as good as the sausage then they are sure to be amazing!",

I'm a huge fan of their original red sauce, but they have some other great options that everyone should try. Their Al Pastor & El Blanco pizzas are delicious, especially if you like a more intricate pizza.   This place is my go to for pizza!

After being there a few times now, its become obvious that their owner Randy is doing an outstanding job running this shop and he's just fun to talk to. Last week we ordered a pizza for carry out and once I got home I realized that they accidentally forgot to include an ingredient on our pizza. This didnt bother me, as the pizza was still delicious. As I sat down to eat, I got a call from the shop acknowledging that they had realized this. I was promply offered that my next visit would be compensated, which I happily took advantage of tonight.   They definitely go the exta mile when it comes to customer service, and their quality of pizza is hard to beat.

    "text": "Loved My Slice of the Pie Pizzeria! We ordered an 18 inch pepperoni with basil for take-out and when we arrived to pick it up, the gentleman gave us an extra slice because he thought the pizza had looked a little small. We were both shocked because nobody had ever done something like that before! He was very friendly, not just to us, but to all the other customers there (I'm assuming he was the owner). Loved the pizza! Great flavor, not too greasy, and big slices. Didn't think it was on the smaller side at all ,but greatly appreciated the extra slice of deliciousness!! Will definitely go back!",

    "text": "I am a Chicago native, so please let that reflect on my review. I am currently on my third slice of The Supreme Being, and have already had a serving of The Rising Phoenix salad-- both are quite delicious.  My Slice Of The Pie is a really, really great \"I've Had A Long Day and Just Really Need Some Quality Pizza Delivered To Me\" type of place-- I've not been in the restaurant, so can't comment on that.  The tomato sauce on my pizza was yummy in a slightly sweet way, the amount of ingredients was very generous, and the seasoning was just right.  The salad was really delightful and unique, refreshing with a kick.  Customer service was also great: the fellow who took my order on the phone informed me that I was out of their delivery range, but made an exception because they weren't super busy (Tuesday night)-- I did not expect this at all, and found it quite generous of them.  Even my delivery guy was very polite and friendly!  When I judge things, I judge them based on what they ARE-- I've seen some reviews of this place that seem to expect My Slice to be a gourmet, white tablecloth kind of pizza. That's not what this is trying to be. There are different kinds of great pizza, this is the everyday \"go-to\" kind that I will order on nights when I just don't really feel like cooking.  Oh! Also (to that point) VERY awesome pricing for the food that you get.  Even if I need to carry out in the future, I'll definitely be returning.",

Pizza was fantastic and there's enough variety in the menu to keep us trying out new combinations for many trips to come.  (I do highly recommend getting  the jalapeno spread on your pizza)  My only issue, seems to be one that was mentioned by few other reviewers.  The wings are coming out just a bit dry.  On one hand, it's nice that they have a crunch to them - hell, some places utilize potato starch with the whole goal of obtaining / maintaining that level of crunch once sauced.  But in my opinion, the whole issue could be fixed by thickening up their buffalo sauce.  Start with a light roux base before adding in the cayenne pepper and then supplement the burn by adding additional peppers (or pepper sauce) - because let's be honest - roux will reduce it a bit.    By thickening the sauce, it'll stick to the wings better and allow them to come out with a better texture.  That said, love this place.  Will be back. Will bring friends.",

This is not fluffy froo-froo pizza; this is fantastic deep flavored New York style pizza that you will think about if you have leftovers. Delish even when left out all night (were in a hotel).   The fella I chatted with on the phone was very pleasant as well. Grubhub did a good job of getting it to us still hot.

There were 3 of us so we decided to start with the Against Pasta Salad. In all honesty, it was OK - not as good as I was anticipating based on previous reviews. It seemed like there was a lot more lettuce and not as much meat and cheese as other reviewers stated. The dressing was really good though. Their slices are pretty big - we ordered 2 of the You Gotta Carne Asada and they were superb! Just the right amount of heat and the dough was perfect! The perfect balance of sturdiness to pick it up in one slice and take a bite with the doughy goodness of pizza! We also ordered the El Blanco pizza and it was really good as well! As my fellow diner commented, \"It left my pallet so satisfying. It was like a crispy communion wafer topped with a delectable mixture!\" We also got the wings and they were great. Especially liked the BBQ Mole sauce! I will definitely return!",

While the pizza stands on its own, another benefit is that we were able to enjoy our food at The Whining Pig a few doors over. The pizza was brought over to us as soon as it was ready (not sure if they are able to always deliver but it was a very nice touch).

The crust had a bit too much flower on the bottom but it was really solid. Sauce was good quality & the cheese was really good. I will say though, the pricing was ridiculous & would stop me from ordering often. I paid almost $30 for the pizza. That's absolutely insane. I get that Chicken & Fresh Mozz are expensive but $30? No way. I would give this place 4 Stars but pricing is a bit much. Even the best spots in NY don't charge that much.",

The Carne Asada Pizza was okay, I mostly just tasted the meat and cheese, not much else despite there being other toppings - the meat must have been too overwhelming and muted the other flavors on the pizza.   Service was great! But the prices were high. For an 18\" specialty pizza it came out to $28. So if you do order that one I recommend sharing it with at least two other people. Also, the bathrooms were dirty and needed some TLC.   I do like the mural, locally inspired and comic relief at the same time - Camelback Mt. as the hump of a camel.",

Nice burnt bubbles on the crust to fight over. Sauce has been flavored properly and is not marinara out of the can. The Franks type hot wings were great, and they have blue cheese (East Coasters do not do Ranch). The service was spectacular, and though the beer selection is sparse, it is varied enough to provide you with the slight buzz that makes pizza and wings even better. WILL BE BACK.",

I happened upon the menu, mostly due to google maps. This \"Pizzeria\" tucked away in a strip mall with its subtle sign shouldn't fool you. Upon initially walking in, the wall art is engaging and enough for the trip alone. But obviously the whole reason you go to a Pizzeria is, well PIZZA. The New Times 2017 best of the Valley is well deserved. Their Oh My Al Pastor is one of the most unique pizzas & delicious creations ever. For the first time, I feel like Arizona can distinguish is own style of pizza based on what these guys put forward. The two times I've been, the staff has been very chatty, friendly and provide excellent customer service. Their habanero sauce, jalapeno sauce, even their regular marinara is house made and delicious. Needless to say, I will continue frequenting this place.",

I used to like the restaurant that was located there before, Slices of Sicily, so I was hoping the pizza would be similar or better. The restaurant had been remodeled and looked nice inside, so I initially had some hope the dining experience might be better too.  Unfortunately, My Slice of the Pie Pizzeria turned out to be a disappointment. Things did not get off to a good start when I found out they do not offer slices for dinner. This seems strange given that the word slice is in the name of the restaurant.   I could accept the lack of a slice option if the pizza had been good, but the pizza I ordered with regular sauce lacked taste and was salty. My friend got two varieties of the wings and did not care much for either. The salad I ordered was OK. Given the prices and the lack of taste of the food, I will not be returning, especially with Pizza on 40th up the street as a better alternative.",

I called the pizzeria to confirm that was in fact the case, because we didn't want to wait that long. I spoke with the owner (I think) and he assured me that he would call them and if grubhub couldn't deliver within the hour he would drive it over himself. WOW! What great customer service!! Shortly after the phone call I received a text that the pizza was on the way. He called me back to make sure we got it. I was blown away with the service!! The pizza, wings, and salad were amazing, and we will continue to order from them. Thanks guys!!",

    "text": "This review is well overdue but I can only speak to the quality of the pizza and their delivery.   When they first opened I called hoping for delivery but Randy the owner hadn't had a chance to set that up but he said he'd deliver it himself.  (They now have delivery service and they are all awesome) . We ordered what has become our standby (New York crust with sausage, onions and garlic, Caesar salad with anchovies on the side) 40 minutes later Randy comes through. Super great guy and here is one of the many reasons why: I paid in cash and he said \"no need for a tip\", well I'm always tipping for great service whether you own the business or not and gave him the money.  The pizza is as good as it gets around here, great sauce, crust and ingredients.   The next day, I think it's around 11 am,  Randy knocks at the door, I said \"hey what's up\" and he hands me $20 and says: I don't think you meant to be this generous\"!   Yah, no I didn't but who does that sort of shit these days?  So there ya go...great food, an amazing owner who deserves and earned my loyalty and I'm guessing you'll experience the same!  Sometimes they forget the extra sauce or something minor but it's easily overlooked,  last night the delivery guy said he'll be right back with the sauce and within 10 minutes, he was!  Okay?  Enough said?",

    "text": "OK. After the sad closing of Mama Mia's on 40th & Indian School over a year and an half ago  I have been searching for a replacement and found it at My Slice of the Pie Pizzeria. Thank God! I tried one slice of cheese and the crust was perfect. Thin but firm and not overcooked with life in it.  The \"bone\" had some chew to it but it was not chewy meaning the crust was fresh and not a sad cardboard imitation of the key ingredient to a pizza. I was not prepared for an actually great pie after many tries in pizzerias around the valley. A generous portion of a tasty blend of cheese and a simple but finely spiced tomato sauce.  The menu looks quite tempting and original with smart sounding adaptations to local flavors such as roasted jalapeno garlic olive oiI, southwest sauce, Cotija cheese, Queso fresco, etc.   I will be back to try a whole pie. Simple clean space. Very nice staff and again a great pizza!",

Cool murals on the wall and several checkerboards built into a table which spans the length of the restaurant. Bring Your Own Booze policy on alcohol it seems.  I got an 18 inch \"the supreme being\" which was loaded with toppings (like a deluxe or supreme). Very tasty. The veggies tasted fresh and the meats were quality.  To go pizza nerd status, the dough had good cell structure and very little or no gel line - remarkable for a pie with so many toppings. I did take a slight issue with the topping distribution on the onions (one slice had none, and the next over had many) but a minor point.  I saw that they had many interesting options and somewhat unusual toppings available. Knowing that a basic pizza is delish I'll definitely be willing to give their more interesting creations a try.  One last note, they are a bit on the expensive side. I'd say it was worth what I paid though.",

It's also hard to find one in this neighborhood.  Enter My Slice.  Well, I've had their pizza and I was not really impressed, but maybe they do sandwiches better?  Sadly, I don't think so.  So anyway, the Italian sandwich came on a bolilllo roll.  Ham, salami and pepperoni with red onion, roasted red pepper, pepperoncini and provolone cheese.  It was okay, but nothing to write home about.  On a bright note, it was accompanied with a quite large salad of fresh greens, crouton and shaved Parmesan.  Finally, huge banner over the front and painted on the window, #1 Pizzaria on Yelp!.  I'm thinking you can do a search for a pizzaria and find ten with higher ratings and many more reviews.  PIzzaria Bianco comes to mind, a place that has won several awards including a James Beard, a 29 Zagat rating and has been proclaimed the number one pizza in America.  1773 reviews with an average 4 stars, is not something to spit on.  Note:  the owner wrote me and claims that if you put \"pizza\" in the search, his restaurant comes up first. Yes, but do search results determine popularity, or is it number of reviews/stars?  Regardless, while it may be True, I think it is a bit disingenuous and misleading, but that is his call.  Subtract 1 star.",

The presentation of the pizza is New York style, but elevated way above your average hole-in-the-wall food. When you fold it, grease doesn't flood out the back, and that's how you tell that what you taste is real and unadulterated.   The cheese is perfect, gooey and stringey with that signature mozzarella chewiness. The sauce is perfectly spiced and thick, and there's just a hint of oregano on top of the whole thing. That little extra step ties things together, and the toppings come in for the knockout. The toppings are fresh, well-prepared, and full of flavor.   Basically, this pizzeria rocked my socks off. They don't need any crazy gimmicks or experimental ingredients because they're just that damn good.  The people running it deserve every bit of good business that comes their way, and generally seem like cool, down-to earth guys that care about their product.",

I will go back to try their speciality Al Pastor and a regular NY slice. I usually also do not like ranch dressing very much but their SW style ranch dressing is oh so yummy!

Our order? A Caeser Salad, The Al Pastor, and the Southwest Veggin' Pizza.  The salad came out quickly and had the good, dark green romaine lettuce that I love in a caeser. We both enjoyed the salad and it was quickly followed by the pizza.  I liked the Al Pastor a little better than the Veggin and my wife was the opposite. It was interesting getting the real al Pastor flavor on a pizza. We both enjoyed the meal, but didn't think it was fantastic. The concept of the place is cool and we will likely be back, but surprisingly, the counter service was meh. I'm always disappointed when the employees seem disinterested in a small place like this. They didn't seem to care whether people were in there or not.  Also - this place is BYOB (beer), and BYOW (wine) , AND BYOL (liquor).",

I just got back from Italy earlier in the year, and the pizza at My Slice of the Pie Pizzeria, just gave all of Italy a run for it's money. The only thing I'm mad at, is that I didn't order more. I'm almost in tears it was so damn delicious..  I was in the mood for pizza tonight, and believe it or not, I was about to order dominoes.. (yuck) instead, I clicked on the yelp app and clicked on the \"pizza takeout\" button.. My Slice Pizzeria was the first thing that popped up, they had great reviews, so I decided to order through yelp.. super easy.. I just clicked on the $2 New York slice option, then added fresh garlic, pepperoni, and mushrooms on one slice, and another slice with artichokes, garlic, and pepperoni. (Many other options/sauces/specialty sauces) it came out to only around $7. the order was ready way before the estimated time of 40 mins. When I picked it up, the guys were so friendly and welcoming, I felt like I was an old friend! When I said I had never been there before, one of the guys grabbed a plate and let me sample all 6 or 7 of their in-house-made sauces (all of which were their own style of scrumptious) without me even asking!.. I will recommend this establishment to literally everyone I know, and I am a pizza lover who will be back for more! TEN STAR experience!! Keep up the good work guys!",

The Italian Bird sandwich is excellent.  They also have carne asada and al pastor pizzas with a south west style sauce that people love.",

We also had their wings with Pineapple habanero sauce and their mole BBQ sauce OMG we were in heaven  I'm not a huge BBQ sauce fan but this one had me licking my fingers! Not only was the food AMAZING, But the staff was incredibly nice,  All smiles great vibes !",

The decor of this restaurant doesn't scream delicious pizza, after all, and the restaurant used to be a more traditional pizza place (that was awesome), but I really wanted to try this restaurant due to the positive reviews. I was shocked at how good it was! First of all, they sell slices at night... brilliant! Second, they have some interesting pizza options that are too weird to pass up. I had to get a slice of Al pastor pizza and a slice of carne asada pizza....ya, you read that right. The slices are reasonable (about 3$), especially because they are quite large. There was some confusion when I got my slices because we waited a looooong time for them, but I think this is not typical for this joint. Anyway, the pizza was incredible. The Al pastor was good (you know...pork...pineapple...can't go wrong there), but the carne asada was amazing. The jalapeno sauce was just right complimenting the tasty meat. You have to try this.... I know I'll be back!  PS 1800!",

I think I love you!!!    \"When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie That's amore...\" -James Marsden  Southwest sauce, mozzarella, Asadero, Al Pastor, red onion, grilled pineapple, cilantro, cotija, fire roasted jalapeno puree.  Created with passion by Randy!  I decided to try them only because on Sundays I have very limited options on what is open after 3pm within walking distance of my work. I generally don't eat pizza very often due to the fact I was traumatized in high school yearbook & newspaper classes (haha really!!!!). So I have to be really hungry or it has to be made well.   I initially ordered wings but after perusing the menu & seeing the different southwest ingredients (spicy ohhhhhhh) & listening to Randy's passionate description of his creations; I had to try a slice of Al Pastor, What? too. I ended up wrapping up the wings for later because I must finish that slice of yumminess. It was very filling but I wanted the whole pie not just a slice.  Lol. It was that goooood!  PS:  had it delivered the 2nd time because was craving it!",

I generally go for a standard NY style slice, so I opted for a plain slice and a slice with Southwest Sauce (when in the Southwest).  I immediately wished I'd gotten two of the SW style slices.  The service was great and staff was knowledgeable and seemed to have a genuine interest in what I thought of their pizza even though I was getting takeout.  Next time I am in the Phoenix / Scottsdale area, I will most definitely make a special trip here.  I also told my local friends about the place.  Maybe they will open a location in SoCal!",

All fresh and fabulous.  Your imagination is the only limit.  Eat it there, it's cozy and laid back or have it delivered if you are in a 3 mile radius of E Indian School and 36th Street.

Really liked the southwest sauce with a hint of spice that sets off the salty cheese and toppings like cilantro and roast corn.  Southwest seasoned meats like adobo chicken, al pastor, and chorizo also worked well. Yes, I realize I used southwest four times now, but that really describes it well, like their slogan \"NY meets the southwest!\"",

I've always said you can get good fancy pizza anywhere, like a $18 single serving brick oven pizza but what New York has that nobody can seem to match is just a regular slice. All that being said what I'm really enjoying now is the awesome selection of Southwest special pizzas they have. Green chilis, corn, cilantro who'd have though but they are so very tasty. My favorite so far has been the southwest veggin out which is crazy because I'm a serious meat eater.",

    "text": "I got delivery today for my team at work to recognize them. I spoke with Randy the owner and he was just a pleasure to deal with. As far as the pizza is concerned , it was very good. I'm from Brooklyn and I have very high expectations for pizza. That being said I was pleasantly surprised at how good this pizza was. He mentioned that he uses a French technique on the dough and I liked the texture. This is one of those situations in which different is good. The biggest problem that I have with pizza outside of New York is the sauce. Well that's not a problem with this pizza because the sauce is well seasoned and delicious. On the first bite I was happy end of story",

    "text": "We dropped in for a late lunch after reading the yelp reviews and were very impressed with the pizza. I ordered a slice of the carne asada pizza and a slice of the el pastor. First off... The pizza crust is amazing. French inspired, and according to the owner who's obviously a foodie is inspired... We talked about their process which takes 2 days for the dough. Not thin, not thick crunchy outside with a bit of breadiness and yeast risen flavors in the middle. Crunchy and firm bit soft and fluffy. On top the sauce was not pizza sauce but an unconventional spicy salsa like base. Layered on top the flavors you'd expect from a world class asada or el pastor are layered with cilantro avacodo cream etc. It's fusion pizza and it's very good. The owner spoke with us and said America's taco shop was his previous gig and the asada and pastor are prepared the same way prior to being integrated into the pizza. They were also testing new food, saw a sweet potato chorizo pie and were given a pastor egg roll test samples by the owner before we left. I have no idea how good their cheese, pepperoni or sausage slices are  but their more Daring slices are so s of the best I've had. Go out and try this pizza, it's amazing.",

We've given this place literally three tries and every time we order for delivery the crust is hard as a rock and the center is mushy and soggy.  It's almost as if alll the reviews are friends and family just trying to help the business or something because we just don't get and won't get it again!",

Went with classic pepperoni and I must say it was delicious despite being a little too salty. We also ordered garlic cheesy bread that was equally delish and would have been better if the marinara sauce was warm. On the plus side, it had fresh basil in it...YUM!  We ordered for carry out and my husband was impressed that he brought out the order and opened to box to show us our order. Something about that gesture made us more comfortable with our pick. The Supreme Being sounds interesting so.....we will be back!",

We waited 20 mins for two slices of pizza and garlic bread. But after waiting 20 mins to only receive one edible pizza cause the other pizza slice they brought out was burnt and had a huge hole in the middle. They said they would remake the pizza. We waited another 15 mins. Then when I asked where the pizza was as we had waited another 20 mins and they said it would be another 5 more mins. I was so unhappy as the pizza wasn't good and my boyfriend didn't even get his pizza. I then told the lady at the counter never mind we weren't going to wait anymore on a pizza that didn't taste good and that we waited almost an hour for it. She then got an attitude. I will never go back again. The sign on the wall best pizza on YELP. What a lie. Not only that but every customer that came in to get pickup orders had to wait there as well. They are slow and food taste gross. I also sampled the ranch and that tasted like watered down ranch.",

In Arcadia we now have quite a few pizza spots but none like this one.  The owner greeted us like we were in his home.  Offered a ball of uncooked dough for our 4 yr old daughter to play with while we waited. Salad was amazing...as good as any place you'll find for about half the price.  The pizza crust was spot-on NYC style with the perfect amount of savory, and sweetness to it...and amazing cheese.  This place kills any national chain pizza place, and it far better than \"pizza on 40th\", \"MOD pizza\", or \"giant rustic pizza\".  LGO is the only Arcadia spot that even comes close but you'll pay $5-10 more for the same pie and you don't have to deal with the shit-show that is the parking situation over there. Do yourself a favor and check this place out.  You won't be disappointed!",
