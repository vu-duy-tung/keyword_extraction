We have been longing for Filipino Food for the last week! My Wife had Then Fried Tilapia fish and BBQ Chicken on a Stick! She loved every bite of her meal. My daughter and I had Lechon Pork and veggies which was bar none Great :)  The eating area was full which means they have lot of customers who love to eat at there place. This Place reminds me of TITA's Kitchenette, and Aling Conchings Cafe in  National City , SAN DIEGO CA!!!  I would recommend anyone passing through to come in to eat and check place out.   I Would Keep Coming Back Here!",

    "text": "Their Sizzling Sisig is a MUST. More than likely the best thing on the menu.   Ok, I'm Filipino so I know my way around places like this. I'll admit, my people's restaurants aren't always easy to navigate if you know nothing about Filipino food. Lack of signage and descriptions is common. If you're a Fili-food rookie, I highly recommend you order from their all day breakfast menu. Those dishes are basically yummy marinated meats served with eggs and rice. No surprises and they're made to order. I prefer my food freshly cooked as opposed to sitting under a heat lamp anyway. Plus, the breakfast grub is served on actual plates instead of styrofoam. The sisig comes on a sizzler thing. Presentation, it matters to me.   The sisig, a pork dish, also comes as a breakfast combo. If you prefer beef try the Tapsilog, also super good. Seafood lovers should get the Bangsilog, marinated and fried milkfish. One of my favorite fish. It's light, white, and flakey. Eating it with eggs is not weird at all.   Boba slush drinks are available and are pretty descent. If you want a totally Filipino meal, try the Sago boba, Sarsi soda, or the Royal Tru Orange soda. For after meal sweetness grab some halo-halo, a shave ice dessert.",

I would go back only for the bbq pork and or the roast pork. Busy place, many filipinas there, so you know its pretty good!  I noticed their desserts were popular as was their halo halo, but I had the boba/taro flavor, and while they forgot my boba, after a reminder, it appeared and was excellent.",

    "text": "Around September of 2009, my mother and I decided to visit an old apartment I grew up at when I was young. So, for lunch, I decided to take my mother for some Filipino food at the Asian Bistro, now called Halo Halo Kitchen.  We noticed there were a lot of flies in there, and the tables were not clean, with the food we ordered was pretty much left overs from the night before for an event.  While my mother and I were trying to eat what looked like burnt leftovers, we were constantly watched by the workers and staff, some speaking loud in Tagalog and laughing. One person even went to the extent to refer to us as 'itos,' a term used for the indigenous peoples of the Philippines called 'negritos.' One lady, kept walking up and down near our table and was constantly staring at us. As we left, the staff started laughing at us!  When we got back home, I called them to complain, and they were very defiant on apologizing. Anyways, I went ahead and reported them to the health department and the Better Business Bureau. To this date, this restaurant, have never apologized about their rudeness, and uncleanness of their restaurant, as well as their staff.  Having lived in California for some time and exposed to the Filipino community, I have never come across such a rude, arrogant, racist group of people. This restaurant is a disgrace to Filipino food. There are much better ones in California. If you want to try Filipino food, try some of the restaurants up in the Mesa/Chandler area. Better yet, I would not recommend trying Filipino food food in Arizona.",

We got chicken curry and pork menudo.  The curry was a little on the greasy side yet still tasty.  The pork menudo was tender and good as well.  I would suggest they give a large scoop of rice and a side of veggies instead of 2 scoops of rice.  Not being much of a rice eater, I wasted 1 scoop.  The flavor was average and rather bland.  I tried some spicy vinegar on mine.  it wasn't spicy at all but added what I needed.  I wish the food had a bit more spice and tang to it.  We would return and add more Sriracha or hot sauce to next our meal.",

It's simple \"turo turo\" (point point) cafeteria style dining combined with a cooked to order menu offers a wide variety of dishes from which to select.  They also serve breakfast  \"silog\" specials (fried rice, egg to order and a meat option) ALL day!  My favorite comes with tocino.  H2K definitely makes me nostalgic for my mom's cooking since she is gone.  Aromas of adobo (chicken and or pork in a soy sauce based gravy), siopao (steamed bun with savory filling), garlic fried rice, sinigang (a tamarind based soup), mungo (mung beans) and Kare Kate (oxtail, eggplant and bok Choy stew in a savory peanut sauce) bring back childhood memories.  Authentic dishes solidify my longterm customer status.  I appreciate good table service at most restaurants. But here, I'm more than content to be left alone to savor my meal with friends, uninterrupted.  Sometimes, I'll order to go for convenience. Visit Halo Halo Kitchen with an open mind and curious palate for a culinary voyage to the Philippines! Oh, and I like the bobas and halo halo too.",

I personally had the Tosilog with a Sarsi and finished it off with, of course, a halo halo.  The Tocino was the best I've had since returning home from my mission and the Sarsi topped it off really well.  It has been over five years since I've tasted halo halo and I have to say that it was exactly as I remembered it.

They always pale in comparison to my family's home cooked food.  But THIS PLACE has really GOOD food.  The lechon was full of flavor and crispy, yet juicy.  I also had the whole fried tilapia, which was delicious.  We also tried the kare-kare.  I couldn't believe it was flavorful!  The Halo-Halo Especial was chock full of goodies.  The atmosphere is kinda funny.  I think that the restaurant doubles as a karaoke bar in the evenings.  They had a full bar.  But I don't care, because the food was GOOD!  Can't speak to the panict bihon or pancit lug-lug...will have to try that next time.",

I couldn't convince my son to try something different so he opted for the cornedbeef dish, which he loved with the egg, rice and tomato.  I will definitely be making this place a go to stop whenever we visit our son! :)",

Luckily for me it was the former.  Great food, and the halo-halo special for dessert shouldn't be passed up.  One day I'll work up the courage to try the food by the checkout counter, but....baby steps.  Don't worry I'll be back.  P.S. They got karaoke is the back.",

Initially a \"turo-turo\" style restaurant where they have different daily selections that they make all day and you just walk up and pick what to put on your plate. While they still do that, they've expanded their menu with various appetizers, \"Pulutan\" dishes (food to eat while drinking alcohol), and the ever so popular \"Silog\" plates, which are different meats served with garlic rice and eggs. Some favorites are the sizzling Sisig and the Tapsilog.   Also with the name Halo-Halo Kitchen one can expect, well... Halo-Halo. one of the most (if not the most) popular Filipino desserts. Sweet, delicious and refreshing. Along with desserts, they also sell Philippine-brand chips and candy that bring you that much more closer and connected to the Filipino culture.   It's a great establishment owned by a respectable family that is quite involved in the Filipino community in Arizona. Aside from serving amazing food, they offer passport and money transfer to their Filipino customers. H2K has become a staple in the Filipino community in the Phoenix Area.",

We had the chicken curry, pork adobo & Filipino menudo. Ate it w 2 scoops of rice each. I could've gone for more than 2 scoops if I'd been eating it at my house hehehehe.... The adobo didn't look adobo to me, not the way how I cook & know adobo. I thought at first it was Lechon paksiw(roasted pork simmered in Philippine vinegar) bec the consistency & color is similar to Lechon paksiw. Oh well, I guess the cooking truly differs from which region one Pinoy came from. I would've loved trying their Halo-halo but we didn't have time anymore. Next time, I'll have that with my favorite scoop of Taro ice cream & leche flan on top....yum yum yum!",

Non Filipinos will not know the difference. The sauce is more like gravy w/c isn't how it's supposed to be. The pancit has hardly anything on it. A little pricey for the quality and portion of the food. Some of the entree tastes like from the packet. The staff all looked miserable. The wait inline is long because there's not enough staff but I see some people behind the desks as if it's a corporate office. Lol.  I assume the good reviews were probably from close friends & family. Overall, it would be an acceptable Filipino restaurant if you don't feel like cooking & willing to spend the money since there isn't much authentic & good Filipino restaurants in Arizona to choose from.  Only thing I appreciated was the Sisig but the portion are smaller than a couple of years ago & sometimes they forget the egg on top",

With an additional purchase of a bottle of water and fountain soda it totaled to about $10. The restaurant is kept clean, with a bar, and numerous tv's (today it was playing the packers game), and the service was great and everyone was very friendly. The spicy ribs were delicious, although I didn't feel like there was any kick to it. Just delicious sweet ribs. The afridata was good but I def enjoyed the ribs more. I did not like the small pieces of chicken bones found in my chicken afridata and eating cautiously just to ensure I don't accidentally swallow any broken pieces of bones did take away from a great experience. I would love to come back again and try their other dishes. I recommend for others to try this place out.",

As far as location goes it's right next to the Walgreens and an Asian supermarket.  There is a decent amount of parking in front of the restaurant.  They pretty much have all of the essentials as far as Filipino food and dessert goes.  I came here on a weekday night and it wasn't so busy and anything like that.  Since they are called the Halo Halo Kitchen, I might as well get a Halo Halo so I did.  It wasn't so bad.  It's homemade so it was good.  However, I felt that is was just ok compared to other Halo Halos.  Kinda ironic to have a mediocre Halo Halo and you are called the Halo Halo Kitchen?  It was almost 6 bucks.  Anyways, the restaurant is decent sized.  They have Filipino food selections and even other Filipino delicacies for sale like polvoron, Magnolia ice cream, and many more.  They have a decent amount of table and seating areas.  They have a TV which plays TFC and related shows.  The staff and customer service is ok. They were kind enough to let me stay to finish my Halo Halo inside the restaurant instead of suffering through it in the Phoenix heat.  Anyways, if you are in the Phoenix area and are craving Filipino overall, this is one of those few places.",

We came here around lunchtime on a Sunday and it was packed with people all waiting in line for a taste of their delicious food.  They offer both a la carte and combination options, and there are a plethora of dishes to choose from. We decided on some 3 item combinations which include 2 scoops of rice. I had the chicken afritada, beef kare kare, and pork dinuguan, while I tried some chicken and pork adobo. The chicken afritada was a slightly sweet, tangy mixture with tomatoes, served with roughly chopped, bone-in dark meat pieces. The beef kare kare was a little murky tasting for me, with some indistinct earthy flavors muddled in with the sauce. The pork dinuguan was good, with tender pork and a rich vinegary taste. I probably liked the adobo out of all the dishes. It was a perfect blend of spices, textures, and flavors.  Service was speedy and efficient, as your dishes are already cooked and sitting in containers buffet style. A 3 item combination plate is around $10, and is a lot of food to eat. I took my meal to go and it lasted for 2 meals.  If I lived closer to this restaurant, you bet I'd be here quite frequently!",

You place your order and the food is put on your plate.  You have a choice to order combo style or ala carte then you sit down.  I don't know and couldn't tell if you can order fresh off a menu for regular sit down.  The place is clean and the 2 ladies behind the counter were very friendly.  I opted for   Lechon Kiwali (deep fried pork belly), fried tofu & spinach and vegetable pancit (rice noodles).  The food was good and had some good flavors.  I would go back again to try different selections.",

    "text": "This restaurant was everything I had hoped for..and more! I tried filipino food for the first time in August (what, there aren't a lot of filipino options in Minnesota..) and I absofrickenlutely loved everything I had. I was so excited to see an authentic filipino option in the heart of Phoenix. The restaurant has an ala carte menu and a regular menu with a ton of options. I opted for a \"three option\" meal and got the lechon, coconut chicken, and this fried shrimp pancake thing..I'm sorry, I have no idea what it was called. On top of that, I also got the special Halo-Halo, lumpia shanghai, and the sisig fries.   I can honestly say everything I had was amazing and if I could, I would eat there every day. You can tell the food is made with fresh ingredients and not any of that frozen or prepackaged nonsense. The girl at the counter was very sweet and patient in explaining the different food options to us.   Here is my review of the food I had:  -Lechon: the best part, tender pork, crispy skin, awesome sauce.  -Coconut chicken: creamy, mild, coconutty without being dessert like,  and full of dark meat.  -Shrimp thing: wish it would have been crispier but great flavor -Special halo-halo: a dessert on steroids, it was like a \"kitchen sink\" type of dessert where there were a bunch of deliciousness thrown into a cup...from what I can remember there was aloe, coconut jelly, taro ice cream, corn flakes, coconut milk, shaved ice, flan, red beans, pinto beans, grass jelly...and probably a lot more I am missing.  -lumpia shanghai: crispy, flavorful, light, and great with the sweet chili sauce -sisig fries: amazingness smothered in more amazingness...this was coated shoestring fries double fried to a crisp with sisig, sour cream, onions, and chopped up pork on top. THE BEST.   The owner of the restaurant stopped in to decorate and check on things and I have to note that she was actually the highlight of Halo Halo Kitchen. There was a fly in the restaurant and she spent a good 10 minutes chasing it around with a swatter and made sure it didn't go near our table. She complimented me on my phone case and we ended up talking about ebay and online shopping for a while. The restaurant has a bar like set up but there was a Filipino drama playing on the flat screens LOL. I honestly felt like I was at a fun relatives house chowing down on awesome food and catching up on soaps. It was so great.",

I primarily came here to try their Halo Halo Special to see if it was anything similar to Halo Halo I get from Filipino shops like Goldilocks, Red Ribbon or Jollibee. Unfortunately, they were out and only had the regular with vanilla ice cream.  They also didn't have sinigang on the day I visited and only left with a small take out of Dinuguan which is a delicious pork blood stew that has a very similar aroma to that of duck and tastes equally as delicious with that graininess that blood has. Simply delicious with white rice.  As with most of the Filipino restaurants back home in Santa Clara area of California, food prices are a bit steep for what they are. It remains True even here, I got a small container of food and a halo-halo for $11.  Nonetheless, I'll be back to try more of their food when I miss my lola's (grandma) or mom's cooking. Crossing my fingers to get my hands on some turon and to try their Halo halo Special.",

It's like going to Pilipino family party except you have to pay to eat. :(   I only went here for brunch, so far, and got some tapsilog. Basically, some garlic fried rice, beef, and a fried egg. I definitely had flashbacks to my childhood. The nostalgia is probably why I enjoyed it so much, but if I'm brutally honest, the food is just ok.

They also had an American menu for burger, fries, popcorn chicken which worked out since my husband isn't fond of Filipino food.

    "text": "I really enjoyed Halo-Halo. A friend brought me here for lunch on a Thursday, and there was a decent sized line at 11:30, which is a good sign to me. Another good sign was that the place was packed with a bunch of Filipino/as of all ages! You know that this place must be good when the regulars definitely know what authentic Filipino cuisine tastes like!  The ordering process is definitely Panda Express-esque. This was a part that I didn't like about this dining experience, given the fact that I could have ordered one large entree of just pancit and called it a day, not needing another entree and a side. But, doing what everyone else was doing, I got the two-entree plate with white rice, pancit, and chicken pastel. They have American food options as well, in case someone in your party isn't down for the Filipino fare.  The pancit was truly delicious. Evenly balanced between noodles, proteins and veggies, it really did hit the spot for my pancit craving. The white rice, well, it was white rice. Not much to say there. The chicken pastel was also quite good as well. The only complaint would be that there were small bone fragments strewn throughout the curry-like stew, which made the meal a bit awkward as I had to spit a few bites out.   They also have authentic dessert items like plantain lumpia, boba drinks, etc. I had one of the plantain lumpia items, and it was okay. Not sweet enough for my personal dessert taste, but definitely not bad.   The prices are beyond fair for the amount and the quality that you get. Service is virtually nonexistent the second you leave the checkout counter. Oh- and keep in mind that when you are finished you take your dishes and your tray to the trash can area, clean your plate, and leave it there versus having someone buss the table for you. Of course, when the craving for some good pancit arrives again, I would probably make the drive to Halo-Halo.",

    "text": "I had visited this restaurant named Halo-Halo Kitchen in 2013 and I had the most horrible experience.  I am an American and often visit this restaurant with my other Filipino friends, but during this last visit in 2013  I had the most horrible experience.  My American friend, who is married to a Filipina, had ordered a hamburger and French fries.  After the order was placed, I inquired about his order and I was told that it would take 5 - 10 more minutes for the order to complete.  I mentioned to the owner, Susan Bulos, that you must have just killed the cow in order to cook the hamburger.  Apparently this joke was very offensive to Susan and her husband as they started to treat me like \"garage\" as a paying customer for their restaurant.  I had visited this restaurant with 8 people, one customer was coming back to the restaurant for the 2nd time in the same day to meet us and enjoy our company.  After I was offended and treated like \"garbage\" I asked the owner to speak to me.  After she made me wait for approximately 8 minutes she spoke to me.  I explained to her that I was an offended customer and asked her to make things right and she refused.   I submitted my credit card and she charged me $82.48, ironically the bill said Thank You at the bottom.  I am writing this commentary to make sure that everyone understands there may be other underlying issues at this restaurant.  As I think about these circumstances I can only ascertain that perhaps the reason Susan and her husband treated me like \"garbage\" was because they had something to hide, perhaps about their hamburger, their cooking, their food or their sanitary conditions.  I looked at my friend's hamburger and it did not look normal.  I can't figure out why a restaurant owner would treat a paying customer in a strange matter unless there may be underlying issues regarding their restaurant.  I emphasize to EVERYONE reading this letter that I gave the owner, Susan Bulos, the opportunity to make things right, to make a friendly gesture to a paying customer but she REFUSED.  As paying customers in a difficult economy, do we, the consumers, really want to be treated this way?  I don't think so.  ________________________________________________________________  Recently my friend posted some Facebook posts regarding Halo Halo - see below what her experience was .....  A friend of mine purchased Ensaymada from Halo Halo on 9/18/14 and was planning on having it for breakfast, but she noticed that there were 2 orange stickers on each of the  packaging indicating their expiration date.  She became curious as to what was underneath the orange sticker, once peeled off she saw that the expiration date was the same day as when she bought the Ensaymada.  She was so disappointed to be deceived by this restaurant and for the restaurant to deceive their loyal Philippine (and white) customers.  To conceal and change the expiration date just by putting another sticker on top of the original expiration date.  It might have been ok if they clearly told each of their customers their food must be consumed the same day as it was purchased, but to conceal this information is very dishonest.  Let this be a warning to everyone eating at this restaurant.  I personally have also had bad experiences with this restaurant's food and service and this only proves that my bad experience was not a sole incident.  If they are doing this to their Ensaymada, imagine what they do their beef and chicken.  I can only imagine how they bend the rules to save money.  If you can't run a business at a profit by following the rules of good business, then close.",

I got three different types of meats into sides and all were very delicious I can't remember the names but one was a sweet vinegary broth with pork another was a barbecue chicken dish and the sides were rice and burnt ends. I also tried the halo halo which is some kind of ice cream mixture and that was the only thing I was not into, there were just too many textures going on at once it was icy and crunchy and cold I'm sure the purple ice cream by itself will be good but I don't know if I'd ever get a it again. I will be back for the food though",

    "text": "Found this place by accident as we were driving around, looking for a place to kill time while waiting to pick up our daughter.  As Bay Area Californians who recently relocated to the East Valley, finding a Filipino restaurant can easily be the highlight of our weekend.  We got the Sisilog, Longsilog, and Pancit and were in heaven!  They were all so scrumptious and reminded us of our parents' home cooking.  And the halo halo??  Perfect way to top off the meal and satisfy our craving, especially in the heat.  The girls behind the counter were very sweet and very helpful.  Only complaint and reason I can't give 5 stars:  We were there in the late afternoon and there was a note that said it would be closing for a private event later in the evening.  It seemed to be a celebration for the family who owned the restaurant.  We still had a good 1-2 hours before that time, but they were already setting up, which is fine.  My issue was that as they were setting up, literally around our table, we felt rushed and in the way.  I get that they were busy and excited about their event, but If they needed the space, they should have closed that section off.  They were decorating and rushing around, all around our table, and no one even acknowledged us or said anything to us.  It was only the older man, who I assumed to be the owner who smiled at us and waved to our kids as we were leaving and thanked us for coming in.  Thank goodness for that nice, simple gesture to help smooth things over.",

Anyway, this is our first time to try Filipino food and we had no idea what to order. The owner suggested us this platter that is good for 8-10ppl so we went with it. It is called Bilao it has Roasted Pork, unpeel Shrimp with some kind of sweet sauce (and it is good), deep fried Fish, half cut salty Egg, Mango, Egg Plant, Bitter Melon, Squid/Octopus, Ribs (I think I included everything but I might miss a few). All I can say everything was scrumptious. For dessert, most of us had Halo Halo. You can order regular or special and we got the special. It consists of different kinds of fruits, some beans, coconuts and topped with mil cereal shaved ice. For regular you get vanilla ice cream on top and for special you get Ube ice cream and Leche Flan (taste like custard). I would definitely come back for Halo Halo and try other dishes on the menu.",

Halo halo is located in the shopping center that's not in a great location so you kind of have to keep an eye out for it when driving to it.    When walking in it's cafeteria style, you can see all the food upfront. They do offer boba and ice cream as well. When there I always get the chicken adobo, the Philippino menudo  and pancit. All is great except the pancit, my cousin makes it better.   The personalities there are never great or welcoming but some cultures are like that so don't be offended.",

And I got my oh so craving of lechon kawali and pancit bihon. Everything was fresh and delicious, even had a great convo with a fellow patron whom spoke so highly of the beaches of the Philippines.

Whenever I'm in Phoenix I tend to make a point to go to Halo Halo Kitchen. First off, their stock varies every day, so I have trouble catching them on the dishes I want like kare kare. This is because the restaurant is buffet style so they can rotate out as they please. The food itself is delicious though! They don't have too many choices, but what they do have I enjoy.   My main complaint is that it's expensive. It wasn't always expensive. They've just slowly increased their prices over time and now I think it's over-priced for what you get.   I still recommend it! Try the kare kare if you can.",

This place would make any Filipino/filipina feel at home.  However, the attitude of the staff needs improvement.  I am a nice guy and I tried to start/carry conversation with the employees and they were not having it. I started to speak bisaya to the main lady working.  She seemed like the boss or manager on duty. As I was speaking bisaya she said \"we don't speak bisaya.  We only speak Tagalog here\" as if bisaya was an insult.  After I started speaking lightly in bisaya I got the same lack of interaction.  I noticed the staff treated other customers much better. They seemed like regulars or family members of the staff on duty. They were also Filipino so I could understand the chemistry being different.  Lastly, the food is good but WAY overpriced.

This is Mom's and my second visit (our first was in July, when sister and her two kids were visiting, so they accompanied us then).  Mom and I weren't impressed with the meal we had then, which included dinuguan, lechon paksiw, longsilog (longganisa, which is similar to chorizo, and \"itlog,\" which translates to \"egg,\" and fried rice dish), lechon kawali, and porksilog (pork chop, eggs, and rice).  I believe we even ordered a BBQ item, and asked for a side of rice (two scoops for $1), which were then rung up together as one two-item dish that cost an extra $2 over what we initially ordered as a la carte!  I decided to give the woman (the owner?) the benefit of the doubt and didn't complain.  Everything was greasy and bland.  Sister liked her longganisa dish very much, though, since it had been a long time since she last had it.  Fast-forward to today's breakfast of longsilog for me, with a side of tocino, and a tapsilog (tapas, eggs, and fried rice), with a side of bangus (fried milkfish) for Mom, and a Halo-Halo special ($1 more than the regular order of Halo-Halo), and again everything was greasy (Mom actually did what I suggested and patted down the meats with tissue paper to soak up some of the grease!) and bland.  Sad to say, but the only thing we both enjoyed was the \"Halo-halo Especial.\" <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/halo-halo-kitchen-phoenix?select=WWzdttOk7G2J3qbOLQk5QA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/halo...</a>  We thought the tiny scoop (between a quarter of a scoop to a third of a scoop'ish) of ube ice cream looked pitiful, but I didn't really feel like speaking to the woman/owner up front anymore, since this was going to be our last visit here.  While we were waiting for our food to arrive, Mom was asking whether we should order some crispy pata, or lechon kawali to go, but by the end of our meal, she'd changed her mind.  Two very disappointing experiences, with each roundtrip costing us forty-eight miles of travel!   Very sad to say that we will not be supporting this Filipino-owned \"turo-turo\" business in the future.  :(  #790",

I ordered the krispy pata and it took more than half an hour to cook so I just had the turo turo items while waiting. Their special halo is not that special. Their ingredients are basically the same as a regular halo. They just added a small piece of leche flan and a scoop of ube ice cream. The female owner and her sons are rude. No smile and talks back with no respect to their customers. Ping and Maria are very nice. They have good customer service to their guests. They smile and talk gently. Will never ever go back to this place. And lastly, flies are everywhere inside this restaurant! Yuck!!!",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I knew nothing about Filipino food outside of adobo and lumpia before coming here. I'm a total noob.   But I know what I like, and I like Halo-Halo Kitchen. There are really several types of foods here:   The stews: Some, like pork adobo or menudo are more familiar. I had the chicken pastel, with potatoes and carrots simmered in a savory coconut milk mixture. It was alright. Just be sure to watch out for bones! Getting a little sharp piece out of nowhere was a surprise, but it's all good. Then there's my favorite--beef kare kare. Beef in a peanut butter sauce, with a very strong little side of salted shrimp paste to top it off with. I like both flavors individually, but can't say I agree with them going together! All this with two generous mounds of rice for $7.00 is INSANELY good.   Oh, and there was the dinuguan as well, or pork roasted in garlic and blood. Yes, it sounds weird! But it's not that bad. don't be a wuss ;-)  There are breakfast plates (read: silog menu), that have various grilled meats with rice and egg. Served all day! :-D  There's the deep-fried Filipino junk food like lumpia, which were alright. I'll for sure come back for the sisig fries!  Then there's the American menu if you wanna be basic AF  Save room for desert. The Halo-Halo is intimidating and probably has a billion grams of sugar, but I'm down.   Service is very friendly, but it's got the super local, laid back vibe to it in which employees are talking among themselves, on their phones, or watching TV while they serve you. Some people are irked by it, but I feel like I'm eating at someone's house. Groovy.   Other oddities include the really cool bar that appears absolutely STOCKED. My pal tells me it's so that customers can party hard on karaoke nights. This place has just about everything you could ask for!",

Halo-Halo Kitchen does not seem to work well with this practice.  Firstly, when attempting to make a reservation for our party, we were told reservations could only be made two days in advance.  Really?  I mean, yes, that's something, but what good is a two day reservation as opposed to just showing up?  If I can't make solid plans, at least a week in advance, then it's not worth my anticipation.  Despite the refusal to accept reservations outside of 48 hours in advance, we decided to hold our breath and set a night for dinner and karaoke.  Well, while eagerly awaiting Karaoke night, we called to make our reservation and, apparently, the \"EVERY Friday Karaoke\" isn't actually _every_ Friday.  So, the date that we've set aside and arranged with friends for the past two weeks has come to a startling halt.  Our much anticipated Karaoke night is no more.  While I'd still love to try the food, do not make plans based on Halo-Halo kitchen unless you like the rush of everything possibly falling apart!",

I've not been to a filipino restaurant since living in Phoenix, so I was VERY excited.  I love filipino food.  It's all I ate for the majority of my young life, so there's also some nostalgia with it.  I did the two item meal thing, which was around $6.  I picked caldereta and pancit.  I thought it'd be best to stick with the basics, just in case it sucked.  The caldereta was almost as good as my mom's, and way better than mine :o)  The pancit was just okay.  The veggies were a bit overcooked and it lacked acid (and I didn't have any lemon in my house).  My son loved the pancit, so it worked out.  The portion was really generous--enough for me, my son, and hubby ate some too.  I will definitely go back to try some other food and bring my husband.  It's a bit of a drive, but worth it.",

Well next time I suggest that you bring your own food from California and stop dissing our own places here! I also don't believe for a moment that these people insulted you by calling you names (\"ito\" for Negrito). It behooves me to think that they would stoop these low and insult people the way you pointed out. As for the flies? I can go to any of the fancier places around town and will find flies at any given time. You were just nitpicking to say something bad about this place.

I found it on yelp and tried it out on a whim when I saw the positive feedback.  My family in the Philippines owns various restaurants in Manila so when I traveled there we ate - a lot.  This it the first restaurant I have found in the Valley where you can get lumpia, pancit, chicken adobo (and various dishes that are more authentic than I tend to eat) and a yummy version of halo halo with ube ice cream.  The people here are very nice, the restaurant was extremely accommodating and clean.   They even stayed open 2 hours later for us when we hosted a karaoke event here.  We loved the boba drinks and for those who were too timid to try the Filipino dishes, they have an American menu (burgers/fries/corndogs).   They have karaoke on Fridays with a great song selection - in English!  Come here for casual and inexpensive eats that are authentic and tasty.",

But as i said all the cooking and serving happens at a snail's pace. If you arrive really hungry, prepare to have ULCERS before they bring in your first order. Their sizzling  beef bulalo is 3 out of 5......only because the steak plate it came in was off the shelf-cold and there was no sizzle at all when they served the dish. the meal was good though so i guess that pretty much offsets the lack of SIZZLE in their so-declared SIZZLING bulalo. Their sizzling fish belly (bangus fish) is EXCELLENT.supposed to be a five but again there was no physical sizzle to what they call Sizzling Bangus Fish. Their sizzling BISTEK (beef slices) with onions were GOOD. Except for the lack of sizzle.....but again the taste covers up for the missing SIZZLE. Their tapsilog (beef and egg combination) and bangsilog (fish and egg combination) is supreme and their banana fritters which they call TURON takes you to unparalleled heights of gastronomic nirvana! They have karaoke which we enjoyed except for the fact that their song selection is so VERY LIMITED.not enough songs. Asian Bistro MUST improve their song selection because their song selection is similar to what a lot of Asians have for HOME USE. There were also some problems with the karaoke system.Sometimes the songs had too slow a tempo....sometimes the tempo was too fast......this so seriously needs to be addressed. Their karaoke is on every wednesday and Friday nights. I wish they would turn it into an every night thing but only AFTER they work on improving and widening their song selection and gets a karaoke jock that actually is musically adept enough to know if the tempo is just about right or if it is way too fast or way too slow. Doesnt take a musical Mozart to be aware of this. It just takes two unclogged healthy ears. Prices are reasonable.the people were friendly....aint surprished cuz i have read that people from the Philippines are a smiling lot and merrily go about their ways........ Even if their karaoke sound system sucks and even if they dont have the actual sizzle to their 'sizzling\" food line-up, this doesnt take away the fact that this is still the best tasting Philippine food this side of the valley.",

The only down side is that it's slightly more pricier, but you get what you pay for. There is also a dessert bar where they make boba drinks and have Thrifty ice cream - my favorite!!!

Therefore, I'm a little biased. Yes, sorry - I am and I think the best restaurant ever is in Las Vegas at my mom's kitchen.   So anyway, I'm not in Vegas and I really was craving Filipino food so bad! I noticed one of my Yelp friends checked in to Halo Halo kitchen so I was motivated to check it out too!   The restaurant was pretty easy to find and we walked in - you can either order from the buffet area and pick one, two or three items or order from the pictures on the wall. I was so hungry that I decided to go for the three item: Kare Kare, chicken adobo, and Pancit (2 scoops of rice are included). I also purchased a halo halo special, chicharon, and ube candy. I was so excited!!   We sat down and the pancit was good, I also enjoyed the Kare Kare, but the chicken adobo I wasn't a big fan of. The adobo just had different or added ingredients that I'm not used to (which is usually soy sauce, vinegar, bay leaves).   Anyway, the halo halo was yummy and it brought me back to my childhood days! A day later- I decided to try the ube candy and needless to say, they were no longer edible. Normally, ube candy has a purple color. This candy had a grey/green color. I took one bite and I knew right away that it was no longer good so I tossed the whole thing.   Overall, if you are curious and want to try something new, I encourage the visit! Also, if you want to fill your Filipino craving, this will definitely hit the spot too!",

The second option was a cured ham dish. I'm not sure what was in the sauce,  maybe coconut milk, onions, jicima...? I was not into the flavor. It seems like a decent place to have a beer and some karaoke. Decent place, clean tidy had a good feel. The three stars was based on my enjoyment of the food.

    "text": "The short:  This really is as good as it gets when it comes to turo-turo style Filipino food--reasonably priced, tasty, generous, and authentic. The staff was welcoming, friendly, and helpful.  The long: Located in a big shopping center on the southwest corner of 35th Ave. and Dunlap, the place is fairly easy to find (in the northern arm of the center), and there's ample parking. When you walk in, you see a typical turo-turo style eatery. Turo-turo means \"point point,\" and they use the term because the food is set up cafeteria style, all in a steam table, and all you do is point at what you'd like to eat. You can go for a one-, two-. or three-item combo served with two generous scoops of white rice. There's also a short order menu that serves some Filipino classics, including a whole \"silog\" menu--which is food served with eggs, usually for breakfast--and some simple American fare like burgers  There were some traditional desserts in the pastry case that served the door and about 16 items in the steam table. My boyfriend and I went for broke because I wanted to see how this food compared to the food I grew up with. We tried the pork and chicken adobo (I'd asked only for pork, but the server didn't like that she couldn't fill a whole 12-oz cup with what was left at the end of the night, she so gave us some chicken adobo in consolation), chicken curry, beef mechado (the sauce is similar to cacciatore--tomato based wit bell peppers), beef kabute (beef and mushrooms, similar to beef stroganoff), laing (stewed taro leaves, what I call the collard greens of the Philippines), and dinuguan (pork in pork blood--not for the squeamish!). The owner also asked if we'd like to try the sinigang, which is a tamarind-based fish soup. To drink we had the sago't gulaman and a mango boba. For dessert (although really, the sago't and boba should be considered dessert for those with a normal, not-homesick stomach capacity), we tried the halo-halo special.   To the point--everything tasted great. If you order on a day your body's really craving protein, you risk suffering death by pork at a turo-turo eatery, and Halo-Halo Kitchen does pork so very well--tender and flavorful. The beef dishes were also well cooked. The curry was pretty standard--the sweeter Japanese style, and the chicken legs in it were also wonderfully tender. The only problems were with the chicken adobo where the sauce was wonderful, but the meat was just a bit dry (you'd think that would be a more common problem in a steam table setup, but because most dishes are stews held at lower temps, the meat stays moist). The laing was more sour than I'm used to--not sure if it was their taro leaves (for the most part, out here, you can only find them frozen or dried), too much fermented shrimp paste (adds a salty, pungent, umami flavor in perfect amounts), or maybe too much patis (fish sauce--adds an earthier layer of the same stuff shrimp paste does), or maybe not enough coconut milk and cream. Regardless, it wasn't bad--just not as sweet as I'm used to. What made the best dishes for me, and what makes Filipino food awesome in my mind, is the sauces. Filipino food is served with rice, and the sauce just soaks into that rice and makes that perfect bite last longer. Because of my choices, we basically ended up with two plates of comfort food, and every bite was definitely comforting.   Our beverages were brought to our table after they were made a few minutes after we sat down, and the halo-halo special came as we finished our dinner. The sago't was good, although the boba grew as the night went on, so sucking it through the straw was crazy. The jelly in the sago't was tasty, though. My boyfriend's mango boba was amazing--at one point, I jokingly suggested they'd just taken some frozen mango and pureed it, but once I said it,  I was halfway convinced that they'd actually done that. The halo-halo special was also awesome. Even though it's considered a summer dessert because it's based on shaved ice, I could eat it year around. It was as good as it gets, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (it might have been jack fruit ice cream), a generous smear of ube, and a chunk of flat at the top, the sweetened condensed milk soaking into the ice, and the usual halo-halo blend at the bottom (red mung beans, jellies, palm fruit, strips of jack fruit and macapuno, etc.). Halo-halo means \"mix-mix,\" and they set the tall plastic cup up with a dome lid and a long-handled plastic spoon so you could churn everything together into homogenized harmony.   The lady at the counter told us the turo-turo menu changes every day, so I'm looking forward to going back and trying their other food, along with all the other food we didn't have room to try. I love a good silog, and I'm sure I could find it here!",

We always have to ask for help even though have been standing in front of them for close to 5 min. Employees will just walk by you as if you are not standing there. The owner is this old woman and she is the worst! Doesn't acknowledge you one bit which is something we are not used to. You would think it's almost as if YOU are lucky to eat there not they are lucky to have your business. But on the bright side I have noticed that their customer service is the best thing in the world when you, you're spouse, or just the company you're  with is WHITE.

I used to have Filipino coworkers who would always TALK about the food, but when potluck time came around, nothing.  Anyway, the place is small and not much space to move around.  The food is in trays and you pick what you want.    I got the 2 picks and knew I wanted adobo, but asked the guy what else is good.  He gave me pancit which looked like lo mein or something.  Then he asked me if I wanted cantaloupe juice.  It took me by surprise when he pointed to this huge vat of orange, icy, slushiness...I stuttered and said \"YEAH!!!\" I was about to check out when I saw somebody (I guess one of the owners or family or somethin') putting something in a bowl.  I asked what it was and the heck if I can spell what they said, but it turns out it was some kind of tripe in a white gravy with rice.  Then another guy came and got something that looked awesome as well, which was pork snout.  They gave me a sample of the snout and yeah, the relationship was instant.  Pig nose and me are now friends.  So I have here in front of me is pancit, chicken adobo, pork snout and cantaloupe juice.  I haven't had such a great meal in a while.  All this stuff tastes just as good as I imagined it would when my coworkers would torture me with mouth-watering descriptions of the stuff.  The cantaloupe juicy is unbelievable...I mean the juice of something as delectable as cantaloupe has no choice but to be heavenly, and it is.  I cannot see myself going without it for more than a week.  The adobo is tender and juicy.  The pancit is not dry like I thought it would be, and has a great taste.  The pork snout is just amazing...its got a tang to it that I can't really describe, but also can't get enough of.  I can't remember what it all cost me, I didn't care after I sampled the snout.  But I got a lot of change back from a $20, so...unless it was all 1's then its not expensive.  The people inside were all Filipino and friendly enough to a newcomer.  I've always wanted to connect with my other nationality, and good food is always a great way to do so.  I know I'll be back whenever I can.  And from what I can understand the other side of the place is some kind of entertainment area, and I think one of the other reviewers said its a karaoke thing.  Cool.  Don't be afraid of Filipino food, folks.  Its hard to compare it to other cuisines, especially because I'm not well traveled in the culinary world.  But I would immediately recommend it, even to the guy who only trusts hot dogs and fried chicken.",

I was at home..  Dinuguan is not for everyone, as kids we knew it at chocolate meat, because the sauce is curdled blood which turns dark brown to black when cooked.

From the look of the \"Asian Bistro\" sign I thought it was going to be like a PF Changs or a Flo's type of place.  However, upon entering, I could see just how wrong I was.  It is a rather large place and very busy on this Wednesday afternoon.  There were probably only 2 or 3 other daring white people there, so I knew this place was legit.  You walk up to the counter to order kind of like Panda Express in the mall.  You pick a 1, 2, or 3 item combo and they put it on your plate with some rice.  From experience I knew that the 3 item combo would be too much for me to eat, but I ordered it anyway because I wanted to try as much as I could.  I was disappointed that there was no sign describing each of the 12 or so dishes that you could choose from.  Well, if there was, it would probably be in a language that I couldn't understand anyway.  Lets just say I was lucky to have come with 2 Filipino coworkers of mine who acted like guides for me.  I resorted to the \"point to whatever looks good\" method which worked until I pointed to the bopis (lung) and the dinuguan (blood soup).  More on those later though.  Anyway, I picked the adobo, menudo, and some other beef item.  The beef and the chicken items were good, but I just don't like how they are little pieces that are still on the bone.  I find it difficult to eat and messy.  However, they were very tasty.  My 3rd item was by far the best.  I got the menudo which is more like a beef stew.  Had I known the name of it I probably wouldn't have gotten it because all I had known previously is Mexican menudo and that doesn't interest me.  At any rate it was very good and I would get it again.  Now back to the lung and blood soup.  My coworkers ordered those dishes and of course they made me try them.  I am not going to lie and say that they were terrible because they weren't.  It is just the simple fact that I know what it is and it is way out of my comfort zone so it made my stomach a little weazy.  The best part of the meal here was dessert.  One of my favorite Filipino desserts is called \"turon\".  It is some sort of banana wrapped in a carmelized wrapper.  All I know is that it is amazing.  My coworkers have brought some to me on several occasions but I just had to have a fresh one right out of the oven.  It was amazing.  They have plenty of other authentic Filipino desserts, but I couldn't resist the turon.  The establishment isn't overly fancy; there are 10-15 large and small tables, a few couches and other misc. chairs.  I think the place doubles as a karaoke bar at night from what I heard.  Anyway, the food is authentic and the service is friendly, but in the end I think my belly is to \"Americanized\" to dine here on a regular basis.",

Also they charge $1.50 for a very small (plastic) cup of tap water, which they don't tell you about until the tab arrives. I had water and boba and paid $7.50 after a $1.00 tip. The atmosphere and design of the place is my only reason for the single-star rating. The food was mediocre and not very diverse for the price.",

The menu was explained to us and we were even offered some samples of items to help us decide.  You order cafeteria style.  I ordered two entree the chicken adobo and beef chunks with veggies in peanut sauce, 2 scoops of white rice. All the dishes were prepared fresh and were flavorful. Nothing was bad tasting however nothing really \"wow'd\" me either.  If you are looking for good food at very inexpensive  price. Give this place a try you won't be disappointed",

Even my wife thought so, and she loves fresh lumpia.  The Bicol express  was mediocre.  The menudo was mediocre.  The kare kare was OK, not great but OK.

I was not disappointed! The halo-halo had a lot of toppings and it was very good! So is the sagot gulaman! It was a little sweet but that's how I like it because I just add more ice and water. The food is mediocre. I wish they had more food that is harder to cook at home. I can easily make mechado and adobo at home. I was really craving lechon paksiw but they didn't have any. I think the food is a little pricey but for being the only Filipino restaurant in the area, I'm not complaining. They have some chips and snacks also but it's expensive. Overall, this place is good for my sweet cravings but the food is not worth drive!  Update: I've tried their Turon, biko, Pichi-Pichi, and ube halaya. They were very good!

They actually didn't have this out on the menu, but I asked and they were awesome enough to make it for me since it wasn't busy when I stopped by. For $8, I felt that the serving could've been larger, but the food itself was still delicious for Filipino food standards in Phoenix.   I also got some treats: the ube halaya and sans rival (sylvana). The ube was good but the sans rival, for a price of $2.50 per piece, was extremely overpriced and honestly not worth it.

The adobo was flavorful and had so much I had made adobo fried rice for breakfast the next morning. They sell deserts and I was so full I could only look and dream about the large Halo Halo desert. I hope this restaurant stays in Phoenix cause it's the best Filipino restaurant I've had in a long time.",

    "text": "I'm going to start off by stating that I've only had Filipino food a couple of times before so I'm not the best critic, however, based on everything that we got, I'm going to rate Halo-Halo Kitchen 3 stars.  When we walked into the restaurant, we got into line to order food cafeteria-style. They had one, two, and three item plate options, each served with two scoops of rice, as well as a few options that were made-to-order. I recognized a couple of the made-to-order items (lumpia & pancit) but didn't really know what the other items they had were. Because they were super busy, I made a quick decision of ordering the Adobo Chicken. Per recommendation of the gentleman who was making our plates, my fiance got the Boneless Bangus.  The Adobo Chicken had a lot of different spices & broth that could be eaten with the rice. I didn't like how fatty the pieces of chicken were but the flavors in the dish were unique. This one item plate was $5. I only had one bite of the Bangus but it was crispy & it too was seasoned with unique spices. I'd probably recommend that over the Adobo Chicken. This fish counted as a two item plate for $7, and came with a side of soup broth as well as rice.  As I mentioned at the beginning, I've not had much Filipino food, but I found everything we got very vinegar-y. As a result of that, I didn't finish my plate of food, but while eating I saw someone else adding vinegar to their food so maybe it's suppose to be that way.  I thought it would be a good idea to get some Halo-Halo Special to round out the meal. They definitely served up an interesting & tasty version treat ... I'd get it again! Just because of how far this restaurant is, I probably wouldn't drive out of my way. If in the area, I'd think about stopping by to try other items since the food is inexpensive.",

I suggested to my boyfriend to take me to this restaurant because of the good reviews and the pictures of the food and halo halo looked amazing.   So we get there about an hour before they closed on Saturday. No one was there except for us. It was set up like a Chinese fast food place where you go up and tell them what you want and they scoop it up for you. We ordered the 3 item meal which was $14. It came with rice and we ordered lechon kawali (roasted pig), paka [something, I forget the name] (pork stew) and pork adobo.  The roasted pig was dry - it's probably because we came close to closing and the food was sitting under heat lamps all day. The pork stew was made from the pork hock - this was greasy and full of bone. The lady scooping this out for us scooped a lot of bone into our bowl. I wouldn't gripe if the bone was attached to meat.... this was straight bone that's fallen off the bone. The pork adobo was not bad but it was also greasy. If you're on a diet - you won't want to get most of their items.   We also ordered the halo halo especial - it wasn't that special. It was basic and boring in flavor. My boyfriend liked it but I didn't care for it.   This place was not particularly close to our home so we will more than likely not be coming back.",

Two of the kids tried the spam sliders and fries which were all good. One of the girls went to town on the chicken adobo over rice.  Mom in law tried the diniguan, which she said was good.  For dessert we tried the halo halo special which was super good. Girls tried the ice cream which was all good.  One of them also tried the boba which was also good. Service was excellent. The staff was friendly. They have a couple large screen tv's playing sports.  Overall an awesome experience with some great tasting food.",

    "text": "If I could give zero stars I would. After reading the reviews and calling another Filipino restaurant closer to our home my family was sold on getting a whole lechon from here for my daughters first bday. From the moment we put in the order it was not a pleasant experience. We were told that they could deliver to a park in chandler were the party was being held, then minutes later they changed their mind and told us they wouldn't deliver it. On the day of the party we had set up the lechon and it was just not at all what we had expected. The skin was not crispy at all as it should've been traditionally. It was just soggy I guess is the best way to describe it. Having hyped it up to guests that they would be having a traditional Filipino dish that was crispy and succulent, it was embarrassing! My mom called the restaurant that day to complain and the wife of the owner told my mom that he would call her back, of course they didn't. So my mom called back today and spoke to Brandon, I think was his name. He said that they couldn't guarantee that the lechon would be crispy, which I think is ridiculous! If you as the customer are going to spend $320 for a dish that is traditionally crispy, then that is what you should get. Brandon also stated that he had seen that it was soggy when preparing it and that out of the three lechons they had prepared that day ours was the only non crispy one, so why did we get so lucky to receive that one. Hmm. He did offer to give half off the next lechon purchase, but why would we want that when this experience was none to pleasing, and anyways it was for a party it's not like we would want to eat a whole lechon on some random day.",

We were passing through Phoenix & decided to lunch here.  Place is cleaner than a lot of CA vendors and standard TFC playing on the tele.  Service is friendly. Prices appropriate.  Didn't have to wait too long for breakfast plates to be prepared, better fresh anyway, rather than it sit there all day waiting to be served. We sampled a few items: KARIOKA: WWhaaatt!??!  Those lil delights are a rare find, but they got 'em here!  Tasty too!  A perfect crisp to the shell & soft inside. 4 per stick, shoulda bought more! EMPANADA:  deep fried goodness! Tasted freshly cooked, not too doughy, an ample amount of contents inside. HALO-HALO SPECIAL:  Hot DAMN!  MASARAP!!!!  Oh so good!  This has got to be my new favorite place for halo-halo & I don't even live in the state! They do their namesake proud! LONGSILOG: My kids devoured this!  Ordered 3 of these & had no leftovers among 3 boys.  SISIGSILOG: I like my sisig with the chichiron-esque crunch & juicy meat.  This was the rubbery cartilage type cooked well. Not my favorite but good for this type of sisig.  We were hoping to try the torta talong but they ran out, must be good. Next time nalang. Great place, wish they operated in Cali!",

We ate for new year's eve and kept in the ref like 2/3 of the tray... I heated the left-overs for our jan 1 lunch & i was disappointed to find it spoiled already... Normally i dont complain but I threw like $29 of the $45 cost i paid for this pancit... I was just wandering how come it did not even last a half day... Working in a food business for 36 yrs, i tried to determine what it might cause... Maybe becoz they packed the pancit while it was very hot (i got it fully wrapped with no holes on it)...or it was cooked early or by batch... It started in the vegetables they mixed with the pancit coz i smelled every single ingredients in the bijon... I called the resto to tell them my experience & all i got was \"i will tell the manager\" response... No sorry at all... Better review on the cooling process & wrapping orders & teach your people how to deal with customer feedback... Not a good way to end 2015 & start 2016 with a complaint... :(",

She quickly got to talking to the guy behind the counter & another customer to see what was good here. She decided on about 7 different items for her, my dad & myself to try. My personal favs were the fried tilapia, chicken adobo (although, my mom's is better!), lumpia, pancit & this fried egg & pork combo that I can't remember the name of. Oh & they also had this dessert which was little round balls on a stick made from what smelled/tasted like doughnut batter. There was a sweet syrup on top with what tasted like coconut on the inside.

Living in Phoenix, far away from my mom in Oregon, filipino food is hard to come by. I make the 30 min drive from mesa just to eat here when I start going through withdrawals. I've had pretty much everything they've serve here. The restaurant is clean, people are friendly. It's a typical \"turo-turo\" restaurant, where the food is prepared cafeteria style but it's all good.",

    "text": "I recently become aware of Halo Halo.  They had my very most favorite dish.  The name has always escaped me.  It has a pork blood base, served with rice.   The first time I had this it was from an in-formal kitchen.  I loved it, it was sole food at its best.   I have had it serval times sence, each time it was different, but just as good and comforting.   There has been times the Filipino server informed me I didn't want that, I would not like it.  This is why, not the pork blood base but the organ meat (offal) and the miscellaneous tidbits or trimmings that was part of it.  It was not made with the best parts, but the leftover parts.  Some times it was a mildly spicy, that is the regional and cooks preference, never hot or more then mildly spicy.  As I had it in the past it had all kinds of notes or tastes, do to all the different bets that went into it.  Sadly, regrettably, and a statement on the narrow minded, American Eaters, in order to serve to \"the American\" customer (to stay in business), this wonderful dish has been turned into a good but 2 note meal.  They use standard pork, one note, the sauce note 2, rice is the binder the same as FOFO, bread, and other starchy foods.     I pity all those that will not even try anything other then Midwest American washed foods.   You think that the Asian food you eat is real Asian, it is American Asian.   Many Asian restaurants have two menus, one for us, the other for the Asian taste.  That menu is call a head.  Sooooo much better, but not steak and potato's.   I hope that Filipino restaurants will do the same thing, so that people can have the True taste of home and strange people, such as I, can enjoy as well.     ITS NOT THE LOOKS, NOT THE NAME, NOT WHAT GOES IN, BUT THE TASTE.",

My fiance and I usually get a two choice with a boba drink and that usually comes out less than $20.  If we're really hungry we get a halo halo supreme to finish our meal.",

I'm not sure if I'll give this place a try again, but I believe in second chances. So we shall see. Sorry Halo-Halo kitchen, but you may need to step up your game a bit, & if I can recommend something, your customer service needs to get better & smile at your customers.. It don't cost nothing.",

As someone who lives in the Midwest eating in a Filipino Restaurant is always a treat and coming to Halo-Halo Kitchen was definitely a super treat!  It is located in a strip mall but don't be put-off by the location. There's nothing fancy about the place but you can tell the owners take measures to keep the place clean and neat.  They have a karaoke bar like most Filipino restaurants do.  You can order a la carte but probably the best way is the \"pick-and-point (turo turo) way\" which is typical of most Pinoy restaurants.  That way you get to sample a better variety of foods.  You get a choice of 2 entrees plus rice.  I had the kare-kare( beef in peanut sauce) and coconut chicken, while my wife had lechon kawali and ginataang langka (coconut jackfruit).  The food was just flat-out awesome. No other way to describe it.  Then we had halo-halo for dessert.  Wow! That was so good, too!  Loved it.  Our friends all enjoyed their entrees and we continued to talk about the food that weekend.  We enjoyed our whole visit to Phoenix that weekend but think this was our gustatory highlight of the trip.  We're definitely coming  back when we visit Phoenix again.",

    "text": "Setting:  I went here 3 times this past week.  Being the last week of school, we had a couple potlucks.  Therefore, nothing says my Filipino culture than bringing some deep fried goodness of egg roll called Lumpia.  They were good enough to bring my wife here for dinner.  Ambiance:  It looks like any other typical Filipino restaurant, but wait...there's a karaoke bar!  Wait, did you say magic mic?  Why yes I did.  They have a full blown karaoke machine they play on Friday nights.  I have not experienced it, but one of the workers say it is definitely a fun night.  Boy, us Filipinos sure love our karaoke!  Open seating with the definite Filipino feel.  After growing up in Southern California, this looks and smells like a Filipino restaurant to me.  Food/Menu:  Lumpia - shanghai style, about 3 inches long, with a good amount of filling.  Crispy, yet not too deep fried.  Very good egg rolls though.  Halo Halo - a Filipino dessert with shaved ice, condensed milk, red bean, canned fruit, ube (sweet purple yam), and ice cream.  They do a decent job.  However, from my perspective, I don't think I have ever had a bad Halo Halo, as most taste the same to me.  Turon - a deep fried plantain banana.  Need I say more?  Okay, well it has a great caramelize coat around it with the crunch biting into a sweet plantain banana.  And BAM!  You got dessert.  Empanada - Tasty snack that will definitely fill you up...for wanting more!  Service:  Seems family owned and they take care of their shop.  No complaints!  Overall:  With the limited amount of Filipino restaurants compared to where I grew up in Southern California.  This place hits home in all the right areas.  Whenever we need to taste our culture, we will be back Halo Halo!",

    "text": "TL;DR (out of 5): In a state with very little cultural/culinary diversity, I was surprised to find the Southeast Asian hole-in-the-wall restaurant that is Halo-Halo Kitchen.  With a variety of traditional options from silog to full entrees to fun snacks and drinks, Halo-Halo has brought the Filipino dinner table to central Phoenix.  Although the oily, diet-overlooking fare isn't for everyone, it's definitely on my list of go-to's in PHX. Food: 3 Atmosphere: 3 Price: 4 Service: 4 Decor: 2  I gave this restaurant 4-stars overall even though my experience with the food was more deserving of 3-stars due to the fact that I went into the restaurant around 4:30 after skipping lunch.  Unsurprisingly, the food (served in a Panda Express-like fashion) was not the freshest. I ordered the 3-combo plate , which comes with two scoops of rice, and chose lechon kawali, chicken adobo, and pork dinuguan (pork and pig's blood stew).  The lechon, which I had heard so much of, was understandably sub-par, due to the fact that it had probably been sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time.  The meat was flavorful and tender, which was my main expectation.  However, the fat was not soft enough, and the skin was not crispy; they were both relatively chewy.  I would expect that a fresh order of lechon kawali would have been much better.  The sauce that it came with was nice, although I'm guessing it's essentially a reduction of the pan drippings from the pork with vinegar and other flavors - but good nonetheless.  The chicken adobo was jam-packed with flavor.  There was a peppery-ness and sweetness that balanced really well.  The chicken itself was falling off the bone and the bones themselves broke apart when I bit into them (although I'm unsure as to whether or not that's a good thing).  I was hesitant to order the dinuguan because it looked quite heavy, but was pleasantly surprised to find that the heaviness of the pork blood was counteracted by the tanginess of both vinegar and banana peppers in the stew.  The pork meat itself wasn't half bad, but I think it had been cooking for a little bit too long as it was kind of tough.  Overall, the food was little too oily for my liking (even for Southeast Asian food) and the foods were a little too saucy, but the flavors were all there.  And like I said, for a hole-in-the-wall Filipino restaurant in central Phoenix, Halo-Halo is doing pretty darn well.  The atmosphere was fine - since I went in at a weird time, the restaurant was essentially empty.  The mom and children who shuffled in after me seemed quite excited to be there, so that's a good sign.  The decor was unsurprising for a hole-in-the-wall Filipino restaurant; very similar to a mexican restaurant, there were cheap tables and chairs organized randomly in dining area with red tile and decorations galore.  I didn't really expect too much in terms of the restaurant's aesthetic from the get-go.  The woman who boxed up my food for me was nice though; she explained what each of the options were and seemed happy enough to be there.  3-entree plate: $10  - rice  - lechon kawali  - chicken adobo  - dinuguan  Next time, I'll have to try their fresh lechon kawali and maybe their silog.  I'm sure that ordering a taro smoothie or something of that sort would also help to cut through the heaviness of their food.",

    "text": "First I gotta say I always made fun of Filipino food cause it all looks the same and kept calling it Mud. I have a lot of Filipino friends and they live by this food/mud so I decided to have an open mind when I came here to try it out.   Let me tell you the tastes looks better than it looks. But of course not everything looks like mud. I found out they have awesome sizzling hot plates of stuff called sisig which has an egg. Also simple plates dishes with the red looking meat called Tocino. It's so flavorful and perfect with the veggies rice and eggs.   Everything is perfect for either breakfast lunch or dinner so when you come here you can eat whatever you like.   I also enjoy how this place is family owned and run so you get that homey feeling, and they have a bunch of tvs. If you're Filipino they play Filipino shows during the day but I've also seen them showing sports.   Now if you're a drinker they also have a bar, now you would think they would have basic liquor they don't they got everything from well vodka to like 25 year old glenlivets. All Johnny walkers all types of premium vodka and the lists goes on. Oh don't forget the beer, thy got the basics as well but they have a lot of other unique beer like red horse which tastes great if you haven't had one try it.   Now they have some awesome baked goods which are baked fresh everyday. And you must try HALO HALO which they are known for, it's a Filipino dessert filled with deliciousness.",

    "text": "This Filipino Food was very good and I think most people can find something they like here because we tried three different meats and a tofu dish and all were different all were cooked nicely with good developed flavor. Nothing was spicy or aggressively seasoned and nothing tasted Chinese or Thai that I tried to me but everything we tried had a rich developed flavor. Portions are large prices are very low I think our combo plates were about $6.99 each.  This place is VERY CASUAL and is set up sort of like Panda Express. You decide on the kind of plate you want just like at Panda and point to what you want on your plate by looking at the food line or you can order from the pictures on the wall. Next you pay and seat yourself and clean up your tray when you leave.   I picked a combo plate so I could try two things. I picked Coconut Chicken and Tofu with vegetables. Both my picks looked familiar like Chinese or Thai dishes to me but neither of them had the seasonings I thought they'd be but the food was still tasty and good. The Chicken was very moist and had great developed flavor from being slow cooked on the bone but they didn't brown the skin so I found the skin unappetizing and had to remove it. That is my only criticism.  My husband tried the pork adobo and one of the beef dishes. He said both were very tender and tasty and he'd come here again.  This was a fun adventure it was like traveling the world.",

Second, when I call ahead to get an order ready, they say that they're gonna get it ready. But they never do. I always have to wait when I get there.",

I'm all for giving second and third chances, but this place is not a 5 star customer service friendly place. It's not busy and yet, we don't get acknowledged by the lady behind the counter. When she did see us and finally looked up,  she had a frown on her face. No hello or can I help you. The customer in front of us was asking another a different server a question and wasn't acknowledged. I had to tell her what the foods were and ingredients. While we were waiting for our lumpia, the servers changed their moods and was friendly to a new customer that walked in, must have been a regular. The food was so so, dry meat and greasey sauces. It's best to learn these recipes myself.  One thing for this restaurant to consider,  be kind to ALL customers and not just the regulars. Believe it or not, new customers are essential to a sucessful restaurant. Especially when they can post reviews or advertise by word of mouth.",

The pork adobo was just ok, but I'm super partial to my own families adobo.      This place is kinda like a filipino panda express where they have prepared food that you can point at and choose.  They also have a menu you can order from though if you want something not already prepared.    BONUS: They also have some snacks and goodies that you can buy to take home!",

My wife wanted pancit instead of rice on a 1 item plate and was told $1.00 more, again no problem a different server removed the one small scoop of rice and added barely a serving spoon of noodles.

I passed,  I have been eating Filipino food for last 30+ years in a variety of Filipino Establishments from HI to LV and never been treated to such skimpy tight wad portions or up charges for noodles w rice. $16.00 for lunch = 1 2 item plate and 1 1 item plate w 2 ice waters.
