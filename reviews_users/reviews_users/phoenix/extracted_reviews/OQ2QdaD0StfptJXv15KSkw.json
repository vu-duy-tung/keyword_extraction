I was not only impressed with menu but the service was top notch also.   The burrito phorrito blew my mind when it finally arrived in my paws. I took bite after bite out of the massive beast, devouring it like a feeding animal.   Seriously this is one of my favorite places and will be for years to come. Phoking good job guys!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I had high hopes for this place but were unfortunately let down. Coming from Boston, we had a go to Pho spot that never let us down. I always got the Dac Biet which would be the traditional at Pho King Kitchen. Not only was there no tendon or tripe to speak of even though both are listed on the menu, but the meat was very over cooked and the broth completely lacked a depth of flavor. I don't understand the addition of the flavorless meatballs, either. My boyfriend has the surf and turf and his initial reaction was that it tasted like water. The broth is really, really weak. It wasn't inedible, but very underwhelming. I'd like to try their burritos sometime, but I'll never get the \"Pho\" again. Especially considering we could a get an authentic helping twice the size for $8 in Boston.",

Very strange broth and the chicken was dry but my food was made fast and got to me very quickly so I thought I would try the traditional one this time around and see if it was any better. It started off ok. But then I realized that there were like 2 rounds of beef and the rest was just like solid tripe. And the tripe was literally just all fat. As the soup cooled down white pieces of fat started to come off the tripe and coagulate. I had to stop eating it and now I'm still hungry. I honestly want to try it again, maybe a different Pho but I don't want to spend $11 for fat soup. :(",

I had the chicken and pork fusion tacos. The chicken was extremely dry and chewy which took the flavor away from the taco. The pork was dry as well. This place has potential to be great, but right now I don't think I would recommend it to a friend.",

No pickled jalapenos or sri racha mayo (bf); or thai basil aioli and pickled root veg (chix) - as promised on the online menu. So, w/out the goodies - they were bland, and dry.

    "text": "Eh... The first time we tried this place, we were given our Pho with NO veggies on the side. No basil, sprouts, cilantro, or lime... We just rolled with it and figured it was a bust. Upon receiving my reciept via square, it asked for feedback. I left some and told them that the spot was dope and that I was stoked to have it literally right across the street from me, but that they should serve the Pho with the traditional fare.    Surprisingly... one of the owners messaged me and said that the traditional ingredients are supposed to come with the Pho, but that someone must have messed up. The place had only been open for a couple weeks... no harm, no foul. He insisted that we come back in and have a couple orders of the vast array of pot stickers that are on the menu, free of charge. I don't write a lot of reviews and I am no food critic.. I don't have unreasonable expectations, and I don't get upset easily. I wasn't upset at all really. However, he was insistent and this is literally in my back yard, so with it being a new neighborhood establishment.. I decided to take him up on the offer. My lady and I walked over to the spot and tried to get in on the offer that was given to us, only to be told that they were \"out of potstickers\"... So That left me wondering how fresh the food being prepared exactly is... When you run out, do you not just make more? This is not a food truck... this is a freestanding establishment in the neighborhood that I live in. This didn't make much sense to me, and it still doesn't. Since they had NO potstickers, I tried to order and pay for the Plaintain chips... they were out of them too...    I was kinda pissed and just wanted to leave but bit the bullet and ordered Pho... our bowls were served up to the window AGAIN, with no traditional sides... I had to ask for them because I wasn't going to stay silent this time. If this place would get it's ish together, then I would literally eat there weekly as it's directly across from my apartment but I can't give money to an overpriced Pho spot for hipsters if I can't count on the food being good, or even being available. They have Hip Hop shows there now and that's dope... but I'm not interested in your place being a nightclub with that tiny bar... I'm interested in your food, which you don't have any of. Word up.. I guess....",

    "text": "My review is for the brick and mortar restaurant.  This small restaurant is located on a very busy street in South Scottsdale so it can be a tough to break into the traffic to get in or out. They offer a patio for outside dining and do offer what looks like a full bar. This is a very casual restaurant where you order at the counter and pick up your food at the pick up window. The playful fusion cuisine is sort of Asian and slightly American -Mexican. They offer pho, a few appetizers, stir fry, burrito phorritos, banh mi burritos and a special of the day.  I had the Burrito Phorrito ($8.00) with added Chicken ($2.00). It was a little different than what you might imagine it to be and was made with spicy hot pickled cauliflower that was ice cold in the burrito. The chicken in the burrito was developed with flavors and was moist. Other ingredients were sauteed vegetables, a mild kimchi and a Sriracha Mayonnaise to pull everything together. I thought the burrito was tasty but would have been better if the pickled cauliflower was broken down into smaller pieces and wasn't ice cold in the burrito. The cauliflower made the burrito only luke warm at best when I ate it. The burrito could have also used some time on the grill for my taste. Still it was tasty just not technically perfect.  We each had one Buffalo Sriracha Pot Sticker ($1.50@) I thought the filling was nicely flavored but I didn't like that the potsticker was deep fried. The potsticker was also very tiny. They seemed very expensive for what they were.  My husband also had the Burrito Phorrito but with Brisket. The brisket was the fatty kind and also was developed with good flavors. Not sure why but the brisket burrito was leaking oil and was very oily inside.   The menu on-line differs slightly from the menu in the restaurant.  The Pho King Kitchen is worthy a try if your in the area.",

    "text": "Being able to talk to the owners and found that they have a very innovative mindset and love bold flavors. Form their menu and from tasting their dishes, they love to experiment and they really love bold flavors. They told me they inherited an old rotating pizza oven where they braise their meat for hours making their meat have the right amount of crunch and the right amount of soft, gelatinously flavor.  I tried 4 dishes while there. The standard pho, one of the Asian fusion burritos, their plantain chips, and while chatting with the owner, convinced him to have me try one of his awesome tacos.  Here's a description of what I ate.  Pho with Pork - In Northern California, I've noticed that no matter where I go, all of the pho tastes the same. It's like there's a standard idea of what pho is and the Vietnamese mafia controls it.  Outside of very Asian dense populations, pho starts to variate and it becomes either decent, or horrible. I know, it's blasphemous to put any protein besides beef in pho but this isn't supposed to be authentic, I told them what was the best combo to get and this was my response.  Pho King has good pho but it is not like regular Vietnamese pho and that's ok. I feel the broth is a bit thicker and richer but the drawback is that it's a bit salty in my taste. I guess you can say you get more bang for your buck for the soup. Other than that, this is a hearty bowl of noodles. The little greens they serve have thai basil, jalapenos, bean sprouts, lime and a new garnish I've never seen before: red cabbage. However, the cabbage actually gives the final dish a very nice purple color and contrasts very well with the green, brown and white.  Burrito Phorrito- This restaurant has two burritos that are based off of popular Vietnamese dishes: Banh Mi and Phorrito. I took the latter which involves stir fried vegetables, pickled vegetables, melted cheese, your meat of choice (I chose brisket) and rice wrapped in a flour tortilla. This was a very satisfying burrito and you get all sorts of crazy flavors (sour, salty, meaty, umami, pickled, refreshing) and texture (cheesy, fork-tender, rustic, fatty,) combinations. I noticed that the burrito has yellow pickled cauliflower. This stuff reminds me a lot of daikon radishes, which adds another layer of complexity to the burrito.  My only suggestion I would suggest in this burrito is cut the meat smaller as I got really big chunks in mine and I feel it would be more beneficial cutting it into cubes.  Plantains with Spicy Mango Sauce - Deep fried plantain chips served with a spicy mango sauce. To be honest, eating them separately was alright, but when you combine the two, the flavors mesh extremely well. Again, you have such contrasting textures and flavors between the crunchy, sweet plantains and the spicy, sweet and creamy mango sauce. These are a great party snack appetizers to buy for your table and the presentation's pretty nice. It's in a nice little queso dish.  Taco with Pork shoulder and pickled green apple toppings - After conversing with the owner for a little bit, I told him about this blog, and how I'm really in to food. He went into the kitchen and pulled out a glorious taco for me to try. The great thing about tacos is that good ones are simple and you can really appreciate the flavors when it comes to eating a taco. The meat had a perfectly seasoned crunch and soft, tender flesh and the pickeled apples on top complements the pork (the old combo pork chops and apples sauce resonated here).   If you like the food truck, you'll love the brick-and-mortar because they have all of your favorite foods, better silverware, free water and of course, alcohol (not free).  I find the items on the menu very creative and very bold in flavor. If you're adventurous and love Asian fusion food, I would recommend this place.",

    "text": "This might be a great food truck idea but not sufficient enough to be an Asian-inspired restaurant. The (self)-service was decent, but the food itself was mediocre.  Pho bowl: Just reading the description on the menu you can already tell there's going to be a problem with the \"1 cup of rich broth\". How is 1 cup of broth enough for noodle, protein, and veggies? It's not. The \"rich\" broth for my braised pork pho bowl was flavorless and tasted like it was watered down with 2 cups of water. Though the broth needed more work done, the braised pork I had was decent and cut up into bite size pieces.  Suggestions:  - Don't water down your broth and maybe have your veggies on a separate dish so diners can choose what they want. - Beef up your eating utensils - this is a restaurant, not a food truck, have real chopsticks and soup spoons! - Having cloth napkins doesn't make the restaurant \"classy\". Let's be realistic... When people are eating spicy flavorful food, their nose will be running and don't necessarily want to wipe their snot with non-absorbent cloth napkins.",

    "text": "Last week, we decided to try Pho King for the first time. I'd never had Pho before and have heard all the rave about it so I was really excited to try it. We walked in at 9:10 pm and greeted by the man behind the counter with \"just so you know, we are closing in 20 minutes.\" Not a great start. We placed our order and asked if it was okay to stay to eat, he said it was.   After ordering our food, I went back to the counter to order some drinks and told the man that their website says they close at 10:30 on Fridays and midway through telling him, he said: \"the website is wrong.\" What?! I told him I wouldn't have come if I knew they were closing in 20 minutes and as I said that, there were about 3 other parties walking in. I said, \"they probably think you're closing at 10:30, too, that's why they are coming in.\" He just looked at me blankly. I could tell he was in a hurry to get out of work but the older man, who was cleaning the entire time we were there didn't seem to mind.   Never having had pho before, I can't really judge the food. Maybe I just don't like pho but the broth was bland and not as interesting as what has been described to me. I don't think I'll go back, but their other dishes (sandwiches and wraps) looked interesting. After the poor welcome and rudeness of the man taking our order, I'd rather not inconvenience him to try anything else.",

That kind of service should be standard, but it's rare nowadays and stood out in a good way.  The wait to pickup has always been reasonable and she is quick and efficient bagging the orders (and really pleasant to deal with). Thank you",

I asked for her but come to find out she no longer works there. I order 6 dumplings. Now no where on the menu does it say they all have to be the same, and last time I was there I did a mix and match. So the girl takes my order  and my money. About a min later I'm informed that they won't make that order for me. Mind you I'm the only customer in the store. You would think they would make my order then let me know they don't usually do that. Not even a sorry for the inconvenience or misunderstanding. So I went with all Ginger pork. As you can see in the pic there was barely any pork in them, they were loose, slimy and tasteless. Not 1 of the 5 people working lcame out to check on the one customer they had. All and all a bad experience and I won't be going back or recommending this Pho King place to anyone. There are way too many restaurants around to have to put up with bad customer service and sub par food.",

The cashier was very nice and explained things on the menu and recommended sauces to try. I went home and was pleasantly surprised that the kitchen stocked me up on the sauces and everything I'd need. They didn't forget a thing which is always a worry with takeout. The whole meal was very interesting to me, which is a good thing. The veggies were fresh and crisp and I loved the pho but I loved the fresh chicken rolls even more! The brisket could have been better but I've never had it in soup before maybe it was supposed to be that way. A little tough and could have been a tad more flavorful. The broth made up for it tho! I really liked it all and tell people about it. I want to go again very soon and try something else!!",

We only ordered the fresh spring rolls and rice and chicken for kids.  I actually came for a banh mi sandwich.  So was super thrown off they didn't seve it. My fault for not looking into it more but the spring rolls were delicious and the curry dipping sauce was great. We ordered a chicken and rice bowl for my kids.  The chicken was bland and they threw french fried onions as a topping with Hoison sauce on the rice.  Nothing special.  I won't be back bc the food here doesn't really interest me but not a bad restaurant if you are interested in banh mi stir fry, banh  mi burrito or a phojita.

Pepsi products for drink, and a Vietnames brand of Siracha that is good.   I will visit again.",

We ordered the chicken stir fry which was, without exaggeration, 1/5 the size of their normal portions and had only 5 very small pieces of chicken.   I expressed my concern to cashier and he pretty much told me that they reduced portion size for event and got upset with me and shaking his head at me, in front of other customers, as if I was an idiot expecting a decent amount of quality food for my money.   He told me to deal with it and offered no solution. I then asked for owner and the owner came out of truck.   He unapologetically handles the situation and started expressing how expensive it cost him to have truck at event and needed to cut portions and value because profits were low and he did not apologize for his employees rudeness or unprofessionalism.   I let him know that they now lost a loyal customer at their store front location as well.   This horrible attitude doesn't surprise me coming from employees, but the owner's was just as bad.   I highly suggest you look at other food truck options that won't charge you full price for half of a child size portion.",

It was insanely salty and I couldn't taste any of the normal flavors you expect from Pho.  The bahn mi was ok, not served on a baguette like normal, the flavor was good, but lacking something as well... sadly, I don't plan to go back.

It's a fusion that offers burritos, and sandwiches, with asian flare.  The entrance is busy due to the placement of the business, however, they have a parking lot in the back.  It's a very colorful restaurant, they have a bar and nice size dining area.  We ordered at the counter.  First thing you notice is their fountain drink dispenser isn't your normal standard soda options.  It's made with natural ingredients, pure cane sugar and no artificial coloring.  I loved them all!!  My favorite was the hibiscus orange soda.  Wow!!  I ordered a half Lemongrass Curry Coconut shrimp  Pho.  The broth was so delicious and the shrimp were cooked perfect.  I also ordered a Kamikaze Cowboy melt. The brisket was so tender and I loved the flavor of the BBQ sauce.  The flatbread is very good and stands up to the melted ingredients. The house made chips were pretty good.  I can't wait to go back and try their other menu items.  They also have a full bar that offers Happy hour and a break on appetizers from 4-6.  Next I would like to try their handmade dumplings.  Service was fast and friendly.",

Personally, what makes a good pho is flavorful broth and I always get a few sips in before adding any sauces. Sadly, this one was kind of bland. I've never eaten from the food truck so I didn't know what to expect. For first timers, don't expect traditional Vietnamese cuisine. I had their plantains too and that was so-so. I also thought the food was a bit pricey.   Some positive notes are that their tacos and burrito looks promising. My wife had the shrimp taco and she liked it so I'll probably come back to try other things. Customer service was great and they serve alcohol.",

    "text": "By far the bottom of the list for Pho in the nearby area. There are at least 6 Phoenix restaurants in a 2 mile radius and unfortunately we choose Pho King this time. Over salted, lukewarm, and overpriced are the three comments we both agreed on. My Pho was served without noodles as well. I had to ask if that's how they served it and they added cold noodles to the already lukewarm broth. Even the garnish bar was sad. Empty trays missing limes, basil, and jalapenos. The staff should spend more time taking care of customers, cleaning, and replenishing rather than gossiping and texting. We were truly disappointed and left still hungry.",

Came in with an open mind, I eat pho at least once a week so I am somewhat an expert!  I Was so disappointed! Just BLAND! Like three green onions in the bowl!! Usually I am slurping the juice to the very bottom, but here i didny even care to finish . Just So generic!! Spring rolls were served with peanut butter and a splash of soy sauce. I don't care about fusion or whatever if that means you are taking all of the flavor out ! For 6 bucks you could go eat a real bowl of pho at  siagon nites and leave satisfied for a good 5 days before the craving kicks in. I will not be back, I don't understand the reviews...these people must have never had real pho before!",

Now for the bad news - Twice when I have ordered carry out I have been charged for items that I didn't receive.  In both instances, I didn't realize the error until I got home and by then it was too late to address. Also, as a veg girl, I am fairly explicit about not adding cheese or meat to my orders.  And, TWICE I have  been served cheese and meat.  Once while dining in, the waitress tried to persuade me that the chix in the dumpling was a vegetable. I finally decided to address the latest snafu asking for someone to contact me about an order mix up on Saturday evening and 2 days later I still haven't received a call back. It's truly disappointing. The food when done right is very very good.  The mistakes though have persuaded me to go elsewhere.  Pho King, please work on your service. Please.",

It had so many different flavors that you think wouldn't be in a burrito. It was more on the lighter, vege side then a heavy filling burrito that you normally expect.

    "text": "Stumbled upon this Pho King Kitchen while on my way home from Scottsdale one evening to pick up some takeout for my wife and I.    We love kitschy places like this, and Pho King didn't disappoint!   I mean, the interior is all artsy hip hop with a great playlist on the sound system, there's a Pho King help yourself sauce bar in there with like a million delicious house made sauces to dip in or smother with, it shares a building with a Pho King dry cleaning place, and the Pho King food truck is parked out back.  How can you go wrong?  While I love that in the drink prices, \"Full Bar\" is listed as \"PRICELESS\", I simply had myself a reasonably priced beer while I waited, then took our massive Pho King order home.  Once I warmed it all back up a little, we dug in and very much Pho King enjoyed the following:  Sriracha Buffalo Chicken Dumplings @ $7 for an order of 6.    Full of flavor, not a bad price!  The Kamakaze Cowboy @ $11 for a pretty hearty sammy.  Take some house brisket and pair it with Tennessee-Asian BBQ sauce and a bunch of yummy toppings and call it good!   Delicious.  Lemongrass Curry Coconut Shrimp Pho @ $10 for a full order.   Awesome flavor, wife loves Pho and she loved the broth.    Bandido Chicken Tacos @ $10 for 3.   Robust little tacos with some great toppings.     All, in this was about $60 including my beer and tip, but we had so much leftover that we got an entire Pho King 2nd meal out of it.   And don't forget to load up on to-go cups of all the sauces if you're doing takeout!    This place is worth checking out.  The food was awesome.",

The noodles and herbs were placed on top in separate packages which is thoughtful so nothing gets soggy....... this time tho. It was pretty sad the broth is half way full barely any flavor or veggies. It just blows my mind that this is the same place. On top of it the front girl with long dark hair is extremely rude (the last time we were here she was also rude). I'm going to try it again. I'm hoping it's not such a disappointment. Literally there was three pieces of green bean in a large order. How do they charge over $9 for barely any pho or veggies when it's a veggie pho??!",

The fact that you CAN leave room for local craft beer means, again, that they take the craft seriously. The atmosphere is the exact opposite -- laid back to a fault, with a four-seat dive bar in the corner (still not sure why), and wearable merch with PHO KING printed on everything.  I have to believe a restaurant like this isn't for everybody. But for someone who consumed enough 90's hip-hop and good Vietnamese food in high school to last ... a while ... Pho King hit the spot.",

That being said for $11 you get a dozen deli thin sliced small pieces of maybe A meatball. My daughter, who is 8, freaked since they share. Thankfully my wife is a great mom and let her have all of it as she ate like 3 fork fulls of noodles. I didn't eat a thing since the moment I walked in the look of the place screamed not Vietnamese.... This is for people who don't want to go to real Vietnamese places (with the actual Vietnamese owners working hard to make it in the USA) but pretend to so they can claim they eat ethnic somewhere in their social network world. Save your hard earned money and go elsewhere. Just to give you a background I regularly go to about a dozen different pho places in my travels.

What makes me love this place more than other pho restaurants is that its not really a traditional Vietnamese place, its Asian inspired, with tastes and flavors from american and Mexican (another place I have spend considerable time) dishes. If you love pho, and also love traditional AZ fare, then this place will be an exciting exploration into textures and flavors (along with all their wonderful corresponding scents) that you would have difficult time finding anyplace else.

The shrimp spring rolls are different, very veggie forward without much shrimp (whatever) and last but not least the pho was really disappointing. The broth was not normal pho broth, but chicken broth instead. And that's why they're getting three stars. The portion was fairly small, which I honestly prefer, and the chicken itself was incredible. However they're cooking it is working for them. They really need to beef up their broth so to speak, but over all everything was fine. I think I'll stick to the place by my house, I prefer authenticity over hipness; the Mexican-Vietnamese fusion concept is interesting. I will gladly change my review the moment they change their pho broth base. Pho you might offer, but you're certainly no king. Get it together, guys! Love the pun that is your namesake, but for goodness sake, live up to your name!",

We walked in and we're greeted by the nice girl behind the counter. As we look over the menue, my girlfriend noticed that the Veggie both that she has enjoyed in the past was not on the menu. We asked the girl if they had it, she proceeded to walk over and ask cook. The cook replied with a disgusted dickish face and tone, \"uh NO!\" We were in shock by this astronomically horrible response. That we emiditly left. We will never be going back as it is so disrespectful to treat someone with food allergies in such a way. Extremely disappointed!",

The long haired woman who cashiered also cut the limes for the side bar.  We found the prices high compared to other pho restaurants - Saigon Nites and especially Pho Thanh.

First, I can understand not giving it for delivery through a 3rd party company like GrubHub or postmates as you can't control that but for regular take out customers? I was physically in the restaurant picking up the food.  I mean, C'mon. What's the difference between $20 I spend eating there or $20 I spend and eat my food at home. Revenue is revenue. IMO, that's bad practice as you're proving to me that you actually have favoritism when it comes to your customers. I mean you literally did nothing different between me eating there or the comfort of my own home so I can watch football.   This was my first time there but given that I may try another Pho establishment nearby instead. Like I said, the food was good but now I have a reason to seek another place. The lady at the front was nice about it btw and it's not her fault.",

Ended up ordering the Great Pho King Noodle Bowl, which was good enough. I decided to splurge and pay $1 each for fried egg and coconut curry. Plus $2.50 for some chicken. Base price is $8.50. It had some rice noodles, pickled daikon & carrots, a ton of spring salad mix (I had to remove about half of it), cucumbers, and jalapenos. The sauce is just some sweet chili sauce served on the side. It was good and a decent amount of food, but it wasn't $13 good.   One thing that MAY have me try them again is their delicious craft fountain drinks. I ordered the pineapple cream soda and it was absolutely delicious.   Also, the ginger pork dumplings were really good. If I go back I'll definitely get them again  Over all I was very unimpressed.

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place because I'm always in the area of their brick and mortar location. The menu and concept works a lot better for a food truck but they're going to have to step up their game if they want the restaurant to be successful.  There's only 8 items on their menu and you pick up your food at the food window.  I understand they're trying to keep overhead cost down with picking up your own food but $10 for a mediocre small bowl of pho is a little excessive.  Didn't think there was value in my meal and that's what it takes when I consider another trip back.",

Never mentioned that the drinks were self service.  Waiting until she brought my food over and then she proceeded to tell me where everything was located.  I ordered the fried spring rolls which were \"meh\" not anything memorable.  The main dish I had was the Burrito Phorritto. It was quite a bit of food, but nothing about it was PHO.  It was cool to go their just to say their name, Pho King, but I wouldn't go back.  If you're looking for traditional Vietnamese food, steer clear from here.",

    "text": "Fun new place just opened in Scottsdale. Love the name!  There is a food truck and a dine in / take out restaurant.   I had lunch in the dining room. I'm not crazy about ordering at a counter and picking up from a kitchen window. This is probably a nod to the food truck experience.   I ordered Ginger Pork Potstickers and a Burrito Phorrito with Slow Roasted Brisket.  I didn't care for the Potstickers. First, they were deep fried rather than pan fried, which is my least favorite way of doing potstickers. I honestly prefer steamed to deep fried. I don't like the chewy texture. The potstickers were generally bland and accompanied with a small container of mango chili sauce that was pretty much flavorless. No spicy kick, no sweet either. Just bland. I also suspect that these potstickers are not house made. I could be wrong on this.  However, the Burrito Phorrito was excellent. Lots of flavorful stir fried vegetables, kimchi, and the brisket was melt-in-your-mouth tender. There were bottles of soy sauce, Sriracha, and Hoisin on the table. If they had fish sauce, it would have been perfect.  I will go back for the burrito again, but skip the potstickers.   I had these two items and a glass of water, bill including tax and 20% tip came to over $24.",

    "text": "My younger daughter & I tried this place out if for no other reason than we really enjoy Pho & it's one of those dishes that is not always done right. We found more consistancy in different eateries we tried when living in the Bay area of No. California.  The name of this place cracked us up so yeah we were definitely checking it out.  The place is small but inviting and the staff friendly. The service is still what the  reviews have commented on in the past 2 years....slow. But we are patient people and passed our time visiting with each other and observing those around us. We liked that the condiment station allowed you to load up on jalapenos,  basil, limes, sprouts and whatever else you needed to compliment your pho. Not all places give you enough so that was a nice bonus.  We started off with spring rolls. They were yummy. We were glad we had these to stave us off until finally the noodles came.  Finally my bowl was placed before me. And only my bowl. We waited at least another 5 or so minutes and noticed that others are receiving their multiple orders but my daughter has yet to get hers. Finally we speak up and the  server just looked at us confused. We showed her our receipt,  waited some more and  finally my  daughter got her order of pho.   The pho was good, very tasty especially with everything we added to it. We ordered their version of a banh mi to go for my other daughter. I was surprised at the shape and how heavy it was.  My daughter really liked the flavors inside and the filling, but was disappointed by the bread. If you're okay with the flat bread instead of a baguette then you'll really enjoy their sandwich, otherwise you'll want to stick to the more traditional approach of most other places.  Overall, worth the visit, the extra time it took to get served and great value. We'll be returning in the near future.",

Likely due to a combo of the onion, ginger and other magical spices and herbs that make up this fantastic fluid.

They have your traditional Pho, but they also have unique twists as well. Some versions include Curry and one that has a Mexican flair.   I went with their \"Medicine Man\" Pho which has loads of chicken and green vegetables. The veggies consisted of cauliflower, green beans, zucchini, onions, cabbage, broccoli, and i'm probably missing some. IT WAS SO GOOD YOU GUYS. I also got their fresh Spring Rolls which were also to die for. I wasn't the biggest fan of the peanut sauce - just needed to be a tad saltier in my opinion but all in all, they were EXACTLY what the doctor ordered. They have a sauce/topping bar with a variety of homemade sauces, limes, bean sprouts, herbs, etc. (Fun Fact: If you have a sauce bar - i'm automatically your fan!)  The service at the front wasn't the friendliest but hey, the food is good errrr \"pho-king\" amazing! I will absolutely be back. I can't wait to try one of their burritos.

Love that there's a nice Asian beer selection and a bar. Makes this place a really dope for quick stop/ early shenanigans type a deal. Giving it a 4 cause I feel like my pho was missing a special ingredient haha it was a little dull in flavor but was able to get it right with all the other sauces they had for flavor. I suppose in a way it's better for it to be under flavored than over flavored. Overall my noodles and beef were very nice and tender I would definitely come back to try other stuff as they do have a pretty extensive menu with plenty of options.",

    "text": "Ok so let's chat...I had super high expectations for this place but unfortunately they just fell short. We ordered two pho's- The American (with beef) and The Hippie (with veggies and tofu)  stir fry and a phorrito (we'll come back to this in a second). Okay so because I LOVE pho I may be a harsh critic but it is what it is. The broth was very Bland and not flavorful in both the chicken and the tofu. However they had all the basic condiments that usually go in pho, so it was very pho-like but the broth was not very flavorfull...good broth has a mild taste and this was milder then mild just above water...we ordered half bowls & me and my youngest ran out of noodles which has never happened before, but its all good. The the stir-fry was good the veggies were kinda under cooked but the flavor was good. None of the entrees came with meat you have to add them if you wanted it for an additional charge. Now back to the Phorrito which was served with a small bowl of kimchi which was gross so I just pushed that to the side covered it with a napkin but when I bit into the burrito ummm yeah I was expecting pho in a tortilla....but it was farrrrrrr from that it was cheese mixed veggies rice and kimchi (which was disgusting) so as soon as I bit it and tasted the kimchi the entire burrito was trashed!! The kimchi was just off kinda had a liquor taste to it but it was NOT good! on the plus I told them about my distaste for the burrito and they replace it with Thai noodle salad and that was good I took that to go so there's no pictures but it was good it was a basic salad with pho noodles and a peanut sauce and some vegetables on the side radish , jalapeno, bean sprouts , carrots and such...one more thing they asked for tip when u place your order but aside from bringing your plates for the back everything is self service!",

This is the first time in my life I wanted to walk into a kitchen and dump out their pot full of garbage \"broth\". Noodles hard enough that you can use them as chopsticks. 4 and a half total pieces of meat that are as tough as getting your favorite hoodie back from your ex. Don't get me started on their house \"sriracha\".  This place has taken my favorite dish and have Pho King ruined it. Instead of being called Pho King, it should be called Pho Servant because this is definitely not a king of anything.   If you're looking for sewer water pho, then this is for Pho King place!",

It came will all my favorite fixings and I also ordered a side appetizer. AMAZING! I wish I lived closer to this side of town to stop by their restaurant as well.

Our first time there the kitchen made the wrong sandwich, and he brought out the wrong one and explained I could munch on that while they made the right one. They also voluntarily told us the plantains were not yet ripe enough, and discouraged us from the chips and the dessert. (twice - gees, guys, buy them earlier, won't you?!?)  The food - awesome. Seriously the best Bahn Mi I have ever had. Granted, my sample size is not huge, but this thing is awesome. And the house-made buns . . . really, you have to try it. I cannot do it justice with mere words. It's more emotional than that. For those of who love bread, anyway.  My wife got the Pho our first trip, and I almost regretted getting the Bahn Mi. It was terrific. And my sample size in that regard is much larger. Truly enjoyable, very flavorable.  Highly recommended. And how often do you get to tell your spouse, \"Let's go to the Pho King restaurant, already!\"?!?",

    "text": "Tried the Traditional pho for the first time. It was a good experience for me. Never had tripe or tendon before and it did take some confidence to chow down, I did really enjoy it. The guy behind the counter was friendly and helpful. Loved their selection of beers and sake. I didn't know that Vietnamese dumplings were basically pot stickers, I was expecting more of a Japanese or Chinese dumpling, so that was my bad. Their house made sauces were fantastic!! The Tennessee Asian BBQ sauce brought my taste buds back to Nashville!! The only improvement was that their fresh herb bar wasn't so fresh... Everything was wilted and browned or super dried out (limes, cilantro, bean sprouts)... It was like 8:45/9 but you can tell it had been there longer than a day... Overall it was good! And since it's super close to home we'll be back when we're in the mood for a decent pho!",

So we figured this place would be right up our alleys. And it is! We both ordered burrito Phoritto, one with brisket and one with pork, and an order or dumplings to share. The tortillas are perfectly chewy, the rice was sticky and we were both shocked that the kimchi was actually kimchi and not just wilted cabbage. The dumplings were perfect, soft insides and crispy edges. And their sauce bar was bomb... house made siracha, some awesome sweet herb sauce! We will be back and bringing friends! My boyfriend can't wait to take his mom here :)",

My bf had the chicken stir fry which he said was awesome! And I had the pho of course. It was so flavorful and so fresh. We had no idea that they had a full bar too.

It arrived within a half hour and was still hot. And phoking deeeeeliiicious as phooooock! I was worried the lemongrass would be too overwhelming, it's not! Goodness gracious, the flavor was out of this world. SO good, people! Spring rolls were dank. Extra fresh. Like SUPER fresh. The freshest. Edamame was perfectly steamed, very edamame-y. Lovely food. Just lovely. I am stoked to go back and get the phorito burrito, tacos. Or anything else. I only wish they had wings because I KNOW they would do 'em right. Oh man. What are you waiting for?

    "text": "I don't ever write reviews. If the food is not good to me, I just move on. But the whole experience tonight...I'll just leave to you to judge. I'll try to be brief. I ordered a Traditional Pho (thin sliced beef round, tripe, tendon, & meat ball) with extra noodles and double meat, to go. When I got it home there was basically meat ball and a few small pieces of tripe. There might have been some tendon, but definitely no sliced beef. The only double meat I could see was possibly the meat ball. Ok, mistakes happen, so I call to see if I was given the wrong order. The girl tells me, 'I checked it myself, that's what you ordered'. No, sorry, there is no beef in here, just meatballs and a few pieces of tripe. She says I can bring it back and they'll remake it. So, back I go. I show her the soup, and what's NOT in it and she just takes it back to the kitchen and comes back out without saying anything else to me. So I politely ask her what happened? Did I misunderstand something? \"Oh, I don't know. I don't eat the beef.\" Hmmm, I thought you said you checked it? The order comes back up and she gives it to me. Opens it up and shows me the meat inside. I'm not a demanding person, but there was no 'sorry for the mistake', and quite honestly I kind of felt they were irritated that they had to fix my order. Just before I leave I see what looks like a cook through the pass through window, so I ask him what happened and he tells me something about everything is weighed out to 2oz and somehow the traditional I ordered got confused for a meatball with double meatball. It didn't really make sense, but whatever, I'm hungry and just want to eat, despite the poor customer service. As for the food...The broth was bland and the double noodles were mushy. I ate the meat, which if it was doubled it was not worth the extra $3.50. Still Pho-king hungry, I threw the noodles and the rest of the broth out. They did however give me another pack of noodles with the replacement soup. I was just about to toss those but they actually felt pretty good; nice and al dente like they should be. I ate them with the soup packet from a  Top Ramen. Much more flavorful than their broth.",

I had a shrimp taco and the tempura tofu taco (liked it best). The kimchi and pickled veggies on top were super yummy. He had their take on a cheesesteak sandwich which he thoroughly enjoyed. Over all consensus: good food but the drink prices are too expensive to lure us in as a drinking hole",

The spring rolls were not terribly fresh (both trader Joe's and pei wei are wayyy better and half the price) and both the chicken spring rolls and pho had hardly any meat in them.  The burritos are bizarre in that they have huge chunks of cauliflower in them that are dowsed in vinegar which does not go well in a cheesy burrito. We ordered via delivery and got one tiny salsa container for 6 tacos.  The tacos only came with raw cabbage and onion and again very little meat.  The pho is $10 watery broth with bean sprouts which they somehow think is a clever garnish.  Plus my bf and I both had stomach aches/cramps after eating.",

    "text": "This is for the restaurant, not food truck.  I was going to give three stars but the owner took the time to ask how the food was and if I had any suggestions. Extra star just for that. Walking in I didn't know this was an Asian fusion restaurant.  Ordered pho with brisket and the spring rolls with chicken. The pho was just ok, I think the noodles were way overcooked, really they should be softened but still a bit chewy. The broth was ok also, wasn't too salty, but wasn't popping with any flavor either. I've certainly had worse at \"real\" Vietnamese restaurants. I usually order the pho tai (thinly sliced beef) and was a little disappointed that I had to get brisket, turns out there were both in the dish. The thinly sliced beef was great (owner said they cook to order and if I wanted that in the future I could get it). The brisket was a little fatty, but brisket is by nature, there was a nice crust on a few of the pieces, honestly I liked it more than I thought I would.  The spring rolls....I think someone needs to work on their wrapping skills! All the ingredients were fresh and the peanut sauce was good enough, but the rolls were falling apart before I even picked one up. The pulled chicken actually made the roll really dry, next time I would get the pork filling.  The restaurant itself is awesome, gorgeous patio out front and full bar, nice colors throughout and just a good vibe to the place. Having the owner show interest in the customers thoughts is refreshing. He mentioned they've only been open a little over a month so it's kind of a work in progress. Also mentioned that what was popular on the food truck is the exact opposite for the restaurant, which they're still trying to get worked out.  I'll certainly go back, I didn't see the hours but seems like a cool place to hang out at night with the bar and patio. The tacos and burritos (phorritos) certainly seem innovative, might try next time. Tho the pho! All I could humbly suggest is to try some of the other highly rated pho joints around (khai hoan in tempe - best pho and spring rolls/egg rolls in the east valley), deconstruct and maybe ask the staff for pointers (the son that usually takes your order there is really nice).  If Pho King could offer a bomb bowl of pho and their other fusion dishes I'd be in like flynn. And if there gets to be a good night life there with the bar maybe offer some tapas or small fusion apps to go with the drinks.  You guys are definitely on to something, appreciate it!",

They only include a tiny portion of garnish in the to go bag. I will definitely be back.",

Poor service I'm all over that but this was such a horrible food experience for me I had to warn you poor souls so you don't make the same mistake I did.   ATTENTION!!!!! If you were going to order the Pho....DON'T!! I didn't even think it was possible to make Pho inedible but these guys managed it! I literally couldn't finish it. The \"broth\" is basically starch water - there's absolutely no taste to it. The noodles they delivered were kind of rubbery in texture. I'll give them props on the veggies, they were cooked properly and there was a nice variety and a lot of them but listen guys this is SOUP. The broth is the key and you made the WORST broth I've ever tasted in my life. I'm not sure about their other dishes but the Pho should be removed from the menu. Total waste of time and money and I'm still hungry or rather now hangary ....UGH!",

    "text": "This was one of those hipster trendy places that make pho cool. Or shall I say hot? ;) ok bad joke. But I ordered \"The American\", super good- it's basically beef pho. It was $10 though, which is fine but I'm used to paying cheaper than 6 dollars for pho. Also, I feel like pho is known for how cheap it is and how big portions you get.   The food was really tasty.  There is a little self serve pho bar, where you get your sides like sauce, limes, bamboo, greens, etc. I like how the restaurant has their own variety of sauces to add to your pho. I did also notice that the soup didn't come with that much noodles. There was a lot of beef though! Which is a plus. The proportions didn't really even out.   4 stars for the food and friendly customer service. Minus one star because of the price.  I think all genuine pho lovers can agree with me though, pho is usually cheap!",

The broth in the lemongrass curry coconut is rich and creamy with a hint of nuttiness. The Medicine Man pho is exactly what you need if you are feeling a bit under the weather.  The portion sizes are enough for two meals!  I can't wait to come back and try everything on the menu.  I live on 7th ave and Osborn but own a salon in Old Town Scottsdale and drove out of my way to get dinner to take home.  I am a fan and a regular for sure!",

Stir fry, rice and one of your delicious meats.  When I entered I noticed the menu was different.  Gone was the basic stir fry with the choose your protein option.  Gone were the several excellent sandwiches and burritos.  What I saw was a confusing list of stir fry combinations with options for noodles and greens instead of rice.  I ordered the Yoko Ono.  The stir fry and rice were the same quality as I have come to expect from the Kitchen.  Jalapenos had found there way into my stir fry.  They were not welcome.  After removing them I realized the pork had no taste without them.  My companion ordered a shrimp dish and had a similar taste flavor free experience.  Also ordered were fresh chicken spring rolls which tasted stale and pan fried dumplings which were excellent as always.  I want my basic stir fry menu back.  I want flavor back.",

Menu gave options but was perfect in not overwhelming so, easy to decide. Took a little long from when we ordered BUT we did come an hour before close so I won't Harp on it. Also the staff was super helpful in describing taste :) We ordered the American and the chicken stir fry. We pretty much cleaned our plates/bowls. Super yummy, it was super light and filling.

I ordered the hippie pho (vegetarian) and their stir fry and one of their home made cupcakes. The stir fry was really good. Had a lot of vegetables and the sauce they used gave it a good kick. The pho on the other hand was not so good. I read a few reviews and a good amount of them state that their pho isn't good. I have to agree with them. It's not the authentic pho you'd expect from a typical pho restaurant. The broth was a bit too salty. Too salty to the point that I couldn't add any sauce to it cause it would just be a sodium over load lol. I ended up not eating the pho. Over all this place is pretty cool I'd say give it a try but probably not the pho.",

    "text": "Didn't have a good experience.  $11 for \"Traditional pho\"... Please go to a traditional pho shop and compare what you get from them vs what you get here at Pho King.  I really like their set-up. It's a dope hipster spot, but if your service is mainly to serve food. Please serve good food.  The pho: You get broth that doesn't taste traditional. You have to have deep flavor in the broth. The noodles are the correct noodles but the meat to broth and noodle ratio is very sad. You don't get a lot of meat and you miss out on the real traditional meats.  To sum it up. For my pho and tip $14 (you pay and tip first before any food is made...) you get a watered down version of Pho.   All this place has to do to progress is to hire a Vietnamese chef with real experience. One that will be there at 4:30 am to start prepping the real broth. One who shops for all the meats that really come in real Pho. Real pho doesn't come out like this. It's a disrespect to the culture and to people who pay such a premium price for such a watered down version.   This experience was like going to Jack n the Box and ordering their tacos to get authentic Mexican Food. Traditional pho?... Not even in the same league.   I wouldn't order again for $3. I'm back to my $8 spot in Mesa. This was just another learning experience while trying to support local businesses.   2 stars vs 1 BC the layout is really dope. They just need to get the food right.",

    "text": "\"Never again!\" - those are the words I angrily uttered after opening our package of food from UberEats.  I gave this place 2 stars as opposed to 1 star, because part of the MAJOR disappointment in the meal was due to my careless reading of their menu in the UberEats app.  The description for pho said \"a huge bowl of rich beef pho broth served with rice noodles... blah blah\"  Well, dumb me I was not understanding that this pho comes with no meat at all - I just assumed that like typical pho it came with slices of raw beef.  At no other Vietnamese restaurant will you get pho that is just plain broth with noodles.  So I paid $8 for broth and a teeny bit of rice noodles and the garnishings (mint, bean sprouts, lime, hot pepper).  On top of that, the dang pho broth didn't even taste that good!  I have a feeling that even if I had selected the additional add-on of $3 for smoked brisket, I would have still been disappointed.  Siggghhh.    The garden rolls (springs rolls) were slightly better, but only slightly.  The cabbage they put in there was too bitter - those rolls are not typically made with red cabbage, and now I can see why.  It's like this restaurant is updating traditional Vietnamese food just for the sake of innovation and being \"modern\" without stopping to consider whether it's even an improvement in taste over the traditional way.  Also, on the service side they gave 2 options of peanut sauce or sweet chili sauce. I selected peanut sauce, so of course what came in my order? You guessed it, sweet chili sauce!  I'm sad because this is one of the few options on UberEats. oh well, now I know!",
