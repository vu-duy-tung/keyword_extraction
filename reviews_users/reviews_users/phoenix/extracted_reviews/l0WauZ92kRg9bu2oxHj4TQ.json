They told me they didn't accept reservations for parties under four, but \"there would be no problem getting seated within 20 minutes.\" So we drove all the way out for dinner, getting there at 6:50, only to be told they were booked until 8:30!! Needless to say, we left. And we will never make the drive out there again.",

I have not been to there restaurant located next to the adjacent pizzeria but, i have to say they either need to close the pizza store or start paying better attention to how the pizza store does business.  I loved and i do mean LOVED  there pizza when it came out when they first opened but, now i can honestly say im disgusted with not only the pizza but the entire stores atmosphere . They never have anything fresh made anymore ( pizza) its old from sitting for hours and what they do have is usually raw never cooked enough. i am writing this review just after going there for lunch and again much to my disappointment no cheese pizza at all and what they had was under cooked pizza looked liked it sat there all morning. The people have also been rude beyond compare with little to no customer service what so ever,There soda is always flat from the fountain and the last few times i tried to go they were out of canned soda,,,I mean really.... Mr Aiello wake up your business and staff they are bringing you down.I am a New Yorker and your Pizza sir is not New York anymore  Plus to add your website states open till 9 the pizza store is not on certain days fix your website.( also i walked in one night at 3 minutes to eight and rude lady stated were closed even though the sign was lit open and the door was open... So very dissappointed in your establishment Wont be going back",

    "text": "We visit Aiello's at least twice a month.  I am a creature of habit so I typically get the same thing every time....the Tortelloni.  Perfection!  My husband always tries something different.   We always do take out as this place isn't really set up to be a restaurant....it's a deli that serves some main courses.  This means we can get sandwiches for lunch and hearty meals for dinner.  The portions are huge and Joe's famous meatballs are no exception.  Recently my husband got the spaghetti and meatballs and said the meatballs tasted strange so he had me taste them but I thought they were great...and I'm the picky eater.    The Aiello's are warm and inviting people and now know us by name.  They know I like extra alfredo sauce on my Tortelloni so I don't even have to ask anymore.  If you have a poor experience with Aiello's please let them know because they are very attentive to customer's comments and are anxious to make everything right for you.  If you think they should stock more desserts tell them.  If you are frustrated because they are always out of a certain item tell them.  They are not new to the Valley but the Salumeria, Isa's Pizza and Charr are new-ish to this part of town.  They run Groupons and Double Take Deals all the time and that may be one of the reasons they run out of some of the more popular items periodically.  You never know how many people will be redeeming those coupons in a week.  I think they are still getting comfortable with the demographics.",

The food is outstanding, and the service is friendly and professional.  The salmon is some of the best I've ever had. I highly recommend the food.  The server easily accommodated my gluten-free preference. They have outside dining areas that will be great in nice weather.  The only thing that was a bit off is a spot or two of peeling paint or wood, and the noise from the kitchen and servers that are behind a curtain next to the table where we sat.  Those were minor annoyances, and the food made up for it.    It's always fun to talk to the owner, Joe, and to enjoy the chance to win our meal for free by picking the correct number from his tumbler of numbered chips.  The food is reasonably priced, so we never mind paying for it when we don't win.  We're definitely fans.",

I always try them if they are on a menu , it's one of my favorites even if I'm not having them , I will still order a single one. Plus I have been to little Italy in New York, I thought they were the best till now!  Anyway, my boyfriend had the chicken Caesar salad and said it was delicious. We will definitely be back and try more things. Pizza looked great will be ordering it soon and they deliver so that will be nice  can't wait to come back soon. EVERYONE should take a try!

Definitely recommend it to anyone coming into town or already here!",

Secondly, the pasta was awful. It was so bland & didn't smell appetizing at all. I picked out the two shrimp & that was it. Lastly, the calamari was hella greasy & wasn't seasoned with anything other than probably a pinch of salt.",

The service was prompt and attentive but they did not hover.  The veal picatta was delicious.  It was tender, pleasantly spiced, and a generous portion size.  The side of cheesy mashed potatoes that where deep fried was amazing.  The chicken Maria was a delight for the senses.  The owner Joseph is very friendly and warm. Aiello's is a terrific restaurant for a date or to bring your whole family.",

    "text": "Ate here after hearing Rick D'Amico (previously from Fox10) rave about this place several times. Maybe I just don't have an appreciation for East Coast Italian, but was just not feeling it. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't great...I guess I'm just used to the West Coast (San Francisco) Italian flair like my Grandfather used to make. My 3 biggest complaint: The restaurant temperature was on the warm side, the spaghetti was still watery and the salad was about one day away from being expired. However, the pork and veal meatballs were good and almost made up for the other complaints. The pizza was just ok and nothing to write home about. There was one other family dining at the other end of the restaurant and was so quiet, you could hear the hum from the refrigerator in the back. Really wanted to fall in love with this place as I love mom and pop joints, but this just isn't my cup of tea.",

Everything had months old finger prints on it and the mirror behind the bar was filthy. I was wondering if what I could see was this dirty and run down, what did the things I couldn't see look like? 10 tables inside and about 10 tables on their patio. We stayed because we were meeting colleges.  Very few wines by the glass. There were 6 of us and 4 entrees came out together, 1 5 mins later, and one not at all. When the server apologized for the cook not making the entree our friend asked if he could just have come asparagus or any quick veggie while he waited. 10 mins pass and no veggie. By then we are done and he is pissed and it's getting awkward for everyone. After a long day working we were all starving and felt so bad about the situation. We joked that 3 different entrees all looked identical even though they were all different meats and veggies. Server didn't do too much to apologize or offer dessert. I believe she wanted us out of there.  He owner that came by when we were seated was of course MIA when things went wrong. Don't waste your time.",

    "text": "Arrived 7:30 on a weeknight. 3 tables seated. No one on the patio. The hostess asked if we had a reservation. OK. No, we didn't. She said it would be about 3 minutes - the remainder of the dining room was wide open. I guess they needed the time to set the table - I didn't pay attention.  No matter. Very friendly people. We've been here a couple times and I started with Aeillo's about a dozen years ago when he opened across from Uptown Plaza in a much bigger space.   Owner/Chef Aeillo is a very jovial guy. He was there and came by the table to schmooze.   The bread served with red peppers in olive oil is very tasty.  We had chicken parm which was cooked/breaded well. The cheese over top was flavorful and plentiful. We also had the lasagna which was very tasty. No room for dessert.  Portion sizes are very generous - take home box worthy. And the pricing is very reasonable especially given portion sizing. Service was friendly and not rushed. I guess there is a balance between wishing for beverage refills every couple of minutes and being left alone to enjoy a meal and dinner companion conversation. I thought our server did a fine job.  It comes down to expectations - I think an \"old world\" fine dining experience is what Aeillo's is aiming for. Old world, to me, means one aspect of the experience is for servers to be in the background. If you need something, catch a server's eye vs. servers nearly constantly at the table interrupting the flow established by the guests at a table.  About 1/2 way through our meal the other tables had emptied out. It was around 8. We started to worry that maybe they closed at 8? A quick online search and we saw they are open until 9. No one else came in after us.   The ambience is quaint and tasteful. I don't know if the neighborhood location lives up to the demographic the decor and the menu of Aeillo's is aiming for. For a relaxing get-away to a cozy dining room serving very authentic New York Italian, Aeillo's is a solid choice.",

    "text": "As good as it gets!  This place blew me away - right away!  As a former East Coast gal, I expected and received great service and friendly staff!  Our server, Brian, was amazing! He even speaks Italian, so if you are, you gotta go!  The owner and chef, Joe Aiello, stopped at every table and said a few words, so you get to know him quickly.  From the first moment I stepped in I was impressed that this little restaurant in a strip mall in North Phoenix was every bit as nicely decorated as many I have been in Scottsdale.    I was there with my best friend and we both thought the food was outstanding!  The bread--OMG - the bread was unlike any I have had before in an Italian restaurant.  It was chewy and crunchy and flavorful and baked fresh with herbs on top.  Not an airy bread with crust but a dense, cakelike texture.  Delish!  Served with spicy hot peppers and olive oil it was the perfect little treat before the meal.   The menu is extensive and it was difficult to choose but I went with the LinguineFradiavolo with seafood - mussels, shrimp, fresh clams, squid, etc., - so much food I had to take home some!  The pasta was fresh, and flavors were smooth and tomatoe based with herbs.  It was lovely.  My friend had the special - Sauteed Dover Sole served with potato croquette and fresh beans. It was flaky and perfectly cooked with just a hint of lemon.    Dessert was a chocolate mousse cake with creamy mousse and moist, dense, chocolate cake, chocolate frosting.  It was to die for!    Everything was perfectly spiced and freshly made!  I will be going back.  Luckily it is just across from Beautyworx where I get my nails done every other week...  If you live in Scottsdale and are used to good food, like at Trattoria Veneto, you gotta try this place.  Make sure you get reservations cause it fills up fast!  We went on a Thursday night and it was crowded.  And, oh, try the Sangiovese wine with the pasta.  It's dynamic!  Reminded me of my trip to Italy, so smooth and rich.  Brian will let you know which one.",

When I opened the appetizer, Eggplant Rollatini, I took a big bite and something was very off with the taste. It smelled odd too so I set it aside and I moved on to the meal, Shrimp Parmigiana, but that tasted funny also. That's when I really started investigating and realized what was wrong. The outer coating (breading) on both dishes, and therefore also the cheese touching the breading, tasted strange on both dishes, as if the olive oil they had been cooked in was burned or old and/or spoiled. It smelled so strongly of a burned and/or spoiled cooking oil, that I couldn't eat the breading on the shrimp and had to wash the shrimp (which were a good size and worth salvaging) off in the sink! Due to the nature of how the Eggplant Rollatini is made, there was nothing I could do to rescue it, and had to throw it all out. The pasta sauce on the shrimp dish's spaghetti was bland. Not just un-spicy, but completely bland. This, on top of the meager serving sizes. Given the taste and small portion sizes, the prices were way too high (and that's forgiving/not including the high delivery fee, which was way more than most restaurants). At the end of the day, the food was very expensive compared to other choices out there for mediocre (or better, which is what I wanted) Italian. I feel ripped off, especially being from the east coast, so the name of the place is what drew me.  This is not east coast Italian.",

Every visit to Aeillo's was bustling, full of happy diners. With that being said I decided to head to Aiello's Salumeria Italian Deli on Thunderbird.  From the moment my lunch companions and I walked in the door, I felt right at home as the owner warmly welcomed us in.  When the staff referred to \"pasta\" as \"macaroni\" and \"sauce\" as \"gravy\" I knew I was in for a great lunch expeirence.  The staff and service at Aeillo's Salemeria Italian Deli was attentive and friendly, and the food was amazing.  The homemade focaccia bread was so good, I am certain I ate way too much of it so I wasn't able to finish my meal. The stuffed artichoke hearts, and spaghetti/meatballs were to die for! I didn't think it was possible to make a better meatball then my grandmother but I was wrong (forgive me grandma).  I definitely recommend this place and it has now become  one of my favorite spots.  In addition, to great food.  Aeillo's Salumeria Italian Deli, offers great lunch specials (2 cheese slices and a fountain drink for 5 bucks) ARE YOU SERIOUS!! GET OUT OF HERE!

I've been to some of the best Italian restaurants in the Little Italy neighborhoods of San Francisco, New York City, San Diego and my hometown of Cleveland, Ohio their food was good, but when I first tried Joe's famous Meatballs and Sunday Gravy - it just blew me away!  Finally, I thought, real, Italian cooking, just like what I was raised on, it actually made me cry.  Joe has that touch, that I can't describe, but it makes every dish special.  I had him take me into his kitchen once to show me how he does it, and there is no secret, just all fresh ingredients, everything made from scratch.  And the flavors are so vibrant!  I always order the Cavatelli with Joe's Famous Meatballs and Sunday Gravy, not only because it's so good, but it also brings back memories of my childhood, growing up in an Italian family.  Ruth usually gets the Linguini Fradiavolo and she loves it. The appetizers also are authentic Italian, some of which, my dad and I made together when I was young, escarole and beans in olive oil, antipasto with real imported meats and cheeses, and the calamari has always been spot on and absolutely delicious!  By time desert rolls around, your stuffed, but the Tiramisu is just so creamy and amazing and the strawberries and Zabaglione are out of this world!   When friends and relatives visit, I always take them to Aiello's and when my family comes to town, some of them born in Italy - they all say it's better than they ever had anywhere!    And Joe and Myra are such wonderful people, they are like my family. They make every guest feel at home, many times just spending time visiting with them at their tables.   I love them.  You will never be disappointed.",

The veal dishes are always cooked perfectly. Due to the storms in the area the electricity went out at the restaurant. Luckily they have gas cooking and the staff and owner Joe Aiello did not miss a beat. They made sure everyone got their meals. refreshed water glasses to keep us cool as the restaurant warmed up with no a/c, offered dessert on the house and free pizza to go for all.  Always a great meal with friendly staff. My favorite place to eat.",

I guess I wasn't sure what I was expecting but I was surprised to walk into to tablecloths on the table and a slightly upscale anti-toddler -- and though OH CRAP I thought Yelp said this place was kid friendly. I did a quick scan and spied the high chairs so all was well. We were the only ones in there (thankfully because the child was talking loudly). They gave a lovely bread basket with a spicy roasted red pepper and olive oil teaser. I loved their bread. Crusty hard but soft in the middle. I had the Chicken Maria which was delightfully tangy, perfectly thin, and fresh. The hubs really enjoyed the potato croquette. The green beans were on point! He had the Papardelle Bolognese. It did not disappoint. Bolognese, for me, is the unit of measurement that i use to judge an italian restaurant's worthiness. While not the best bolognese (my vote is tied between Bianco and my mom's) it was seriously delightful and REAL DEAL bolognese. The child, being the adventurous eater that she is, had butter noodles. She ate more than 1 bite which meant she enjoyed it. They do this really fun thing at the end of your meal -- you pick a number 1-90 and if they pull your number, your meal is free. How cool is that?? Will definitely be back -- neighborhood gem!",

Rest of the food was bland little salt doesn't hurt anybody, watery sauce... the price is what's ridiculous if everything was 5$ less I wouldn't complain but 2 people 85$ without alcoholic beverages or any beverages at all is stupid for this for that price u shouldn't have anything frozen and if your specializing in Italian with that price try making your own pasta and cooking it el dente like every other real Italian spots not to a mush... frustrating cuz it's just robbing people blind... there pizza joint is good just tried it the other day even with that they forgot some items and didn't reimburse me but was so was excited to try this place cuz how good the pizza was... tarimisu was also good but 8$ for a small slice frys and Safeway is 5$ for literally twice as big",

The food was absolutely delicious, the service was first rate, and the chef/owner was out and about in the dining room to greet guests with his warm personality.  This is easily one of the best Italian places in Arizona, and has very fair prices as well considering the quality and quantity of food that you receive. The dining area is small, but a large patio makes up for any space issues.   We came with our two young boys (4 & 1), and were warmly greeted, with the chef even saying a special hello to our youngest. We will certainly be back in the future as it's very apparent that the family-owned restaurant cares about their customers and wants to put out a high quality product.",

Aiellos is a small place and I am seeing plenty of excellent Italian culinary tradition.  The menu is quite extensive. All I am going to try today is the special. A stellar large roast beef, hero sandwich, featuring a golden toasted baguette and served with a fresh side salad of mixed greens placed on top of the meat, that includes tomatoes, red onions, and shaved Parmesan. $6. This sandwich was damn good. The beef was pink and lean. The bread was fresh and crusty. The pasta salad had noteworthy Italian cuts of meat. Everything was choice.  I also just realized this place will deliver. Now that's an Italian restaurant.   Next door Joe and Myrah Aiello serve their pizza at Isa's Pizza. If your lucky, you get to chat with one or both of the husband and wife team and Joe will have slices of white pizza ready to go. Two slices and a coke $5.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Faiellositaliandeli.com%2Fmenu.html&s=7963733d325163cfffd5e2257ef3f5fa04c9fa4745d666122d1167287f92a819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">aiellositaliandeli.com/m...</a>",

    "text": "I come to this review having no bias, since I never heard of Aiello's until it came to my 'hood near Moon Valley. The wife suggested we try it, so we did. I've never been to the central location and had no idea what to expect here.   People tend to think that \"Italian deli\" is an easy thing to pull off. I believe it is not, because I've eaten at far more Italian delis that I DIDN'T like than I have liked. Aiello's falls neatly between these two extremes, agreeably tasty but... not quite what you would call a great \"deli\" experience.  I had the antipasto salad, the thing by which I judge all Italian delis. What I got at Aiello's was not a salad. It was a meat and cheese plate. With a few paltry greens, artichoke hearts and giardiniera. Oh, and a delicious piece of a ciabatta bread. Everything on this plate was fabulous (especially the fresh mozzarella drizzled with balsamic vinegar). But it wasn't a salad. I took a picture of it - check it out. The thing is, all they had to do was put about fifty cents more worth of what I'll call \"salad type material\" (you know, romaine, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers) on the plate with a dash more of the oil and balsamic dressing and BAM - I would have had a HELL of a salad. As it was, I had a delicious meat and cheese plate. Seriously, my wife got a sandwich and her side salad had more salad than my salad salad.  Also the atmosphere seems... rushed. It's like they had a checklist of \"things which one finds in an Italian deli,\" and they checked them off one by one but didn't put a lot of thought into it. Wire rack shelving with Italian imported dry goods? Check. Refrigerator case with meats and cheeses? Check. Refrigerator case with pre-made... stuff? Check. But the wire rack is sparsely populated, the meat and cheese fridge looks as if stuff was thrown in there randomly and never touched and the pre-made stuff had a tell-tale sag that made it seem that gravity had been doing its work for at least a few days now. Not really impressive.  Compare this with DeFalco's in Scottsdale or even Tony's right down the street at Dunlap. Real delis that have fairly complete selections of imported goods and freshly made stuff. Aiello's is more like a restaurant that has some deli-like window dressing.  Both of us enjoyed the flavors, however, so I'm willing to try it again sometime. Perhaps I'll ask for a side salad next time for my antipasto meat plate.",

    "text": "I spent many decades living in and around Los Angeles and there were no really good Italian restaurants there.  As a native New Yorker and former New York cop, I worked all 5 boroughs and visited many Italian restaurants throughout NYC and neighboring Westchester County.  Good as they were, Aiello's Salumeria could stand toe-to-toe with the best in and around New York.  I came across it a week ago and was awed by the terrific salad that comes with lunch.  No iceberg lettuce with a bit of onion and, if you are having a lucky day, a cherry tomato like you get in a salad that most restaurants throw in with your sandwich or  other luncheon choice,  The salad are a delightful mix of terrific greens and covered with the perfectly right amount of homemade dressing.  I would expect to pay $5.00 or $6.00 dollar for the sensational house salad alone.    I've since returned for other lunches consisting of their different salads, all topped with their homemade dressings and delicious fresh baked bread served with oil and vinegar with a spicy red pepper dipping sauce has me ever ready for the main course to come,  I've had lunches there and dinners as well.  Everything was scrumptious, especially the meatballs (made with special meats that make them particularly distinct and an absolute delight).  They even make their own Mozzarella cheese which is to die for.  I've been to places in New York where they make Mozzarella cheese for restaurants and also package it for distribution and retail in markets.  Never have I tasted such a cheese as pleasing to the palate with a smoother texture as that made at Aiello's.   I find the quality and quantity of the dishes to be inexpensive for the awesome flavor and subtly significant portions.  The portions might not look that large, but it is enough to fill you and then some... it must be some kind of optical illusion!    I've dined in people's homes as well as fine restaurants when traveling in Italy and this was reminiscent of those memories and experiences. Quality and freshness of the food, the ambiance (especially at dinnertime), the freshness and homemade essentials, along with the quantity to go with the quality makes Aiello's special place to be experience.  For a real True taste of Italy and the best of its gastronomical pleasures, it's Aiello's any day for me!",

So obviously I like/love this place.  The food is awesome. Everything is prepared fresh. I have never had anything I didn't like. Besides lunches and dinners,  I have picked up food for family birthdays and a high school graduation get-together.  Part of the charm of this place is that it is a small local business, family owned and operated. It has character.   This is the top choice of my mother's when we pick her up to take her grocery shopping, to the doc, etc.  She can no longer drive to due a stroke. I am here once a week, every week. We almost always get the 2 slices of pizza lunch special, different toppings, a great value.   EVERY SINGLE TIME we visit, we are greeted by friendly employees who are quick to take our order. The atmosphere is so pleasant that we  eat-in, and hang around for a while to visit afterwards. Frequently one of the employees or the owner will chat with us for a minute. It is always a pleasure to lunch there.  The pizza is truly amazing, you can't go wrong with anything. I LOVE the Nana's pie, and sometimes they have a great special slice available w/ 3 sauces, alfredo, red and pesto.  Some of our family favorites beside the AWESOME pizza: stuffed artichoke hearts, calamari, veal marsala, house salumeria hero, chicken parmesan, eggplant parmesan.",

It's the most perfect date spot I would go once a week for the rest of my life if I could and I probably will. There cheesecake is to die for and all their pastas have never disappointed. I'm allergic to tomatoes so I order mine with pesto sauce or a lemon wine sauce instead and they're always very accommodating. They make awesome drinks at the bar I had the best dry martini with extra olives there. I would say my only complaint is that sometimes when they run out of good bread the bread basket they bring you is clearly leftover dough that they had from their pizzas that they just be can bring to you and it's not very good. But the oil with hot peppers in it that they bring you to dip your bread is to die for, I always drizzle a little of it over my pasta or any entree I order because I can't get enough of it.",

I tried the Chicken Parmesan sandwich. It was big and delicious and came with a scrumptious salad on the side too. I tasted the Salumeria sandwich too, and it was also very tasty. That one had a nice spicy bite to it; very good!  I wish I lived closer to this Aiello's. If you live in the northern part of Phoenix though, this place is certainly worth checking out. I'm looking forward to returning anyway.",

I postmated their Chicken Park dinner to me and I was excited to try it. I have to say, I wasn't disappointed. My FAVORITE dish is Chicken Parm and I'm pretty picky about it. Theirs was breaded nicely, the sauce was delicious, the spaghetti was plentiful, and the garlic knots (as I remember them) were perfect. I absolutely enjoyed the dinner all to myself and I'm looking forward to maybe making it into the restaurant sometime. Def give it a try if you're looking for authentic italian.",

I had lost faith in Arizona Italian over the past 2 years since I relocated here. Everything tasted like Chef Boyardee Beefaroni. Aka puke food. I almost gave up on Italian until I saw decent reviews on OpenTable regarding Aiello's. So my wife and I gave Aiello's a shot and were pleasantly pleased. The service gets an A+, the ambiance is perfect NY Guido-like  with nice table linen , red patent leather circular seating and Frank Sinatra singing in the background. This gets my A rating for replicating SPQR Restaurant in Little Italy NYC.  The food was served warm and fresh, pasta al dente, salad fresh and crispy. The so called Aiello's famous award winning meat balls had a bit too much bread filler for my palate. Red sauce perfect. Therefore the food gets a B grade compared to NYC quality. Overall, I am intrigued and satisfied enough to become a repeat customer. They have a lot of interesting dishes on the menu. I want to reassure future customers that Aiello's is an all right place to dine and you won't be disappointed. Some of the reviews I have seen by Yelpers seem ridiculous. Go find out your self with an open mind and be civil to the waiters.",

The meatball came apart about as easily as manure too, just a little pressure with my fork had the disgusting thing spread in small pieces throughout half the plate. Blah! Who knew that the Italian classic, spaghetti with \"Joe's famous meatballs\" was capable of being so royally destroyed. Let it also be known that these were advertised as \"best in New York,\" which could not be anymore misleading.    Necessary facts about myself: I grew up in Pittsburgh moved to New Jersey after I married, where I have been living for more than 20 years. Thus, you can imagine I have tried billions of east coast restaurants in New York, New Jersey, etc.     My son ordered cavatelli with sausage and a meatball which turned out pretty much exactly like my dish except the sausage was \"actually not complete garbage\" according to my son.     With the necessities out of the way, I still have one question. Who in their right mind decided it would be a good idea to claim something like \"best in New York\" and \"famous meatballs?\"",

We were both extremely disappointed in the lack of flavor and temperature of the food.  I got a notification of when the food was picked up and 8 min later it was at my door.  The food didn't have enough time too cool down to just above room temperature in that amount of time. My chicken was tender but it just tasted like fried chicken with tomato sauce dumped on it and covered with cheese.  There was no Italian seasoning to the chicken or the sauce.  The spaghetti wasn't warm and the menu showed it comes with potatoes croquettes and seasonal vegetables...apparently all potatoes and vegetables are out of season because they didn't make it to the house.  My wife's meal was very plain too.  Hers was cold and vapid. We also got standard bread that most Italian restaurant serve and that was cold and very yeasty.   We got a couple of dessert to go with the over priced meal, Italian Cheese Cake and Tiramisu both were disgusting. The cheese cake didn't have any flavor except for a metallic flavor and the tiramisu tasted like it was a couple of days old.  Spare your taste buds and go to Olive Garden there food is much better than this place.  Honestly just got to the grocery store and buy a frozen Italian dinner it would have better flavor.",

After getting seated quickly. our server took drink orders and left menus.  We knew what wanted right away and as soon as she came with our beverages, we ordered the Cavatelli with red sauce and sausages & meatballs.  While we waited,  the fragrance from the whetted our appetite.  A few minutes later, our waitress brought the feast and allowed us to dig right.  The iui sauce was the wonderful Aiello red gravy, very warm and flavored just right.  I broke into the super sized meatball made with beef, pork and Valley. Perfect!  The last part were ricotta cavatelli that should have that light to the tooth bite, instead they the firmness made them rubbery and hard to chew. Our young waitress came by at the sight of our distress and asked if something was wrong. We explained the problem and she returned the food to the kitchen to prepare it properly.   A few minutes later, she returned again with our food and again we waitress waited until we ate.  It appeared the kitchen dumped hot sauce as the fix. The Cavatelli was still very hard.  She offered something else from the menu, but by this time we had our wine and bread, as well as our disappointment.   The waitress took care of our check and apologized. The service, wine and waitress were excellent,  just the kitchen let us down.  Since this was a rare occurrence here at Aiello's we be back.",

    "text": "I won't even begin to talk about the service or the food, because I think it's great. I don't write a lot of reviews and when I do they're usually bad. But this time I'm writing a review because this place deserve a round of applause.  I was on the corner of Thunderbird and 7thStreet when I saw this homeless man his sign said \"he would just like some food\" there's a McDonald's on the corner but I figured he was probably tired of people giving Him McDonald's.. I thought it might be nice if someone actually got him some really good NY style pizza so I pull into Aiello's order the Lunch special which is two slices and a drink for $6.00 which is a great price also The gentleman who cuts the pizza his name is Tony asked me what I would like I told him I don't care I'm just trying to feed someone and at that very moment is when I realized how great this place is. They hand me the pizza  for free and said because I was doing good for someone else that it was complementary to me along with 2 ice cold bottle Waters.. I was willing to pay for it so I left the balance in the tip jar, but it sure was nice of them to help me Help someone... way to go Aiello's.. #YoureTheBest   The end of the story was that I brought the pizza to the homeless man and he actually ended up getting in a car. I felt kind of dumb afterwards But I knew my heart was in the right place... so Instead of letting that bother us we decided he shouldn't be the only one getting pizza so we went back to aiellos pizza and got us some pizza too and it was so good.   The ricotta, spinach, tomatoe pizza is just for me",

    "text": "This is NOT East Coast Italian food. I repeat... this is NOT EAST COAST ITALIAN FOOD! It was one of the worst Italian meals I have ever had. Three stars for the Mozzarella Carozza and Calamari (which brings this place up to a 2 star average) but that is the best I can do. The waitress was friendly enough and did a decent job. However, she did forget my mussels appetizer which I didn't point out because I didn't want the rest of my group to have to wait.   The baked Clams Oreganata had way too much Marsala wine in them. It overpowered the taste. The pasta dishes were over cooked and not al dente. The Lasagna was average but it tasted like it has been cooked and frozen for a long time. The Carbonara and the Spaghetti with \"Joe's Famous Meatballs\" were both sitting in a puddle of water in their bowls. Drain the pasta properly please. I want to taste sauce, not recycled reheating pasta water. The meatballs were pale and looked under-cooked. Not sure how or when these could EVER be ranked the best in NYC. They were mushy and instantly fell apart. I have had better frozen meatballs and that's saying a lot coming from an East Coast Italian New York girl (sorry nonna).   And where do I even begin with the cannolis? They were the size of a child's thumb, $6 a pop ($3 would have been reasonable), and lacking citrus or pistachio. They had a gummy consistency; tasted like they used flour as a filler. Espresso was served without sugar or lemon peel like on the East Coast.  The dining room doesn't look half as nice in their staged website photos and is coated with dust. It's on the back of the booths. It's on the lights above the tables. You can see it moving on the chandelier in the middle of the room. Make sure it is not falling onto your pasta in place of the Parmesan!  To top things off, we had made our reservation on OpenTable. We showed up on time and checked in. The next morning I received an email from OpenTable saying the restaurant had cancelled my reservation. I didn't even get my 100 points for this terrible meal.   We won't be back. And please, if you have any decency, any concept of what good East Coast Italian food is, don't bother eating here.",

Fun, quiet and nice to have good service when one doesn't expect much. The best part was pulling the number out, I said, #69 but my Son said #71 and what came out? #69. Yeah, worth our $80.00 plus tip, will be back. By the way, the same owner owns the quick pizza and wings place next door.

He explained to me that their style of Italian is not as spicy  as the type  of Italian I like.   he did offer a full refund however I booked and paid through Yelp so he was unable to do that.  NOTE TO SELF... DONT BOOK OR PAY THRU YELP!  He he owns three restaurants and he offered give certificates free meals whatever he could do to make me happy.   it's nice to know that there are Business owners that have integrity. So I raised my rating to 3 stars because of Joe's integrity.    After reading all the reviews and 4 a half stars I was really looking forward to our dinner. I am sad to say that for the most part it was very disappointing. Other than the Cesar salad dressing there was absolutely no garlic taste with either Sunday gravy dinner or a chicken Parmesan. We spent over $50 Plus the five dollar delivery charge and a five dollar tip. The \"famous meatballs\" were basically tasteless and kind of spongy as though they had been frozen prior to heating them up for my dinner. The chicken Parmesan had one small chicken breast and a side of spaghetti for $16.   I'm not sure why our dinners were so different compared to the wonderful ratings written by other people. If this was an off night, I would sure like to hear from the owner.",

Great people, great food, not just sandwiches (which are absolutely hands down first class. House Salumeria. Jesus H Christ.) but also great pasta and all sorts of other treats, and now pizza!   And I don't need a goddamn fork for the salad I've got forks at home :D  I was there once and there was a very good looking eastern European lady outside having a coffee and smoking a cigarette. Reminds me of being in great places. But five  minutes from home.   As a rule I don't go to \"burger restaurants\" besides Delux, since it's the original, nor do I go to anywhere with a name \"X: a YZ\" but after I learned that the people behind Aiello's also run Charr, which now occupies the space once home to venerable Market Bistro, I will have a try.

The sandwich came and it was so-so in terms of appearance, but figured it might taste better than it looked. The problem was, it did not have any roasted peppers as stated on the menu AND it had portabello mushroom on it which is not listed on the menu. I went up to ask about the peppers and was told that they were \"out of roasted peppers\". Hmm.  The sandwich was pretty blah and I would not order it again.   The heavy, gruff guy on the pizza side of the business adds a bit of authenticity to the Italian experience, but I will think twice about going back not knowing if they will be \"out of\" the items I might want to order.

    "text": "4 Canoli's and 1 small (3 bites) Tiramisu-ToGo was $35. Raised in New York, grew up in Bensonhurst, I can say I'm extremely familiar with Italian Cuisine especially with Pastries.  Was craving some good Italian Pastries, drove by and figured I would give it a go, before I went in I checked out their website-ok-looks legit. I walked in, was given a friendly greeting= 1 star. I told the boy behind the counter I would like to order some pastries to go...he said oh pizza? What kind? Moving on..the menu was easy to read, nice setting, clean= 1 star, young lady at the counter was very informative, polite, smiles and all together great customer service=2 stars. Placed my order of 3 Canoli's and 2 Tiramisu's, to go/take out, balance total $34.98! ! ! Yikes! Ok, waited a few minutes, a man came out with a neatly tied up shopping bag with each pastry indivually boxed. Nice.=1star..total of 5 stars. Went home with my Mom and 7 year old all very excited.....which brings me back to the beginning of my review... they gave me the wrong amount of pastries. Fail! -2stars.  Listening to the customer is key. Given it should not be a big deal but without exageration the Tiramisu was literally 3 bites , it was a 2 inch square piece, for $6? I just spent $35, that's a lot for just 5 pieces of pastries. I'm going back to my old spot on Grand Ave. For that I can get pastries to last me 2 weeks.  Was so excited but now dissapointed. Didn't try the plated food, so maybe and I hope it's better. But unfortunately I'm not going back. Over 15 years in the food industry and if one area is lacking on the menu than its hard to hold the rest together...any menu should have items that can accompany any other item...just my opinion.",

    "text": "Used a Groupon that was expiring today - my first visit. Got three items for takeout at lunch, and brought them home and into the refrigerator for dinner tonight. WOW! All three items were exceptional. The Salumeria sandwich was our favorite, packed full of artichoke hearts, fresh mozz, roasted peppers, and a variety of meats. A little on the spicy side, which we liked. The grilled chicken with fontina and roasted veggies was no slough, either. Next time, we're asking for some of Aiello's spicy roasted peppers to kick it up a notch. The lunch special was grilled chicken with fettucini - another winner. All three entrees were served with a tasty side salad, and one that was not an afterthought. Fresh, multi-colored spring mix with a couple of grape tomatoes, red onions, and shredded cheese dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette. Truly a notch above. Oh, they also included some of the Aiello's house foccacia - again, YUMMY. What a great experience. We can't wait to return.",

    "text": "Remember, Yelp says 3 stars means A-OK.     Billed as \"The New Little Sister\" of Aiello's on Central and Colter, this casual, come-as-you-are, dining and deli operation occupies the space formerly home to Pick-Up Stix; what I had thought of as a not too terrible chain, sort-of- Chinese place.    Arriving by chance at 5 minutes before their opening at 11 A.M., I was extremely happy to see a lucite box of menus affixed to the exterior wall, which gave me the chance to see if I'd be at all interested before making the, sometimes awkward, implied committment of entering. I noticed that the couple and the single (waiting for a friend)  who were to follow me in, all used the considerately placed menu box as well. Point for Aiello's.    The menu was broad and appealing enough for me to make a choice, and I waited just a minute after the door opened to walk in. The staff was doing minor last minute setup, giving me the necessary moment to take in the new surroundings without feeling rushed, and also gave me the chance to take in the deli cases of meats and cheeses. Overhead, the basic menu is repeated on a huge menu board, a bit crudely installed, in comparison to it's former incarnation, ala Pick-Up Stix. To the left are two wire racks that comprise the \"grocery\" section of boxed pastas, marinated artichokes, etc., and to the left  of that is a narrow cooler containing delicious sounding varieties of prepared raviolis, boxed ready for your home kitchen. At  $12  for a 15 ounce tray, I'd like to sample some of yours, please, before I'd cave to that pricepoint. Don't know if they're sauced, or if that's an add-on. I guess the price isn't too horrible if they're as good as they sound, and especially if you're going to order anything in-house, with those items at $8-15.    I had the roast pork, rapini, & provolone hero for $9 w/ salad. The sandwich comes on a good, rather broad and tall, 6 inch Italian roll. (semolina) A half-dozen relatively thin sliced tenderloin medallions are arrayed along the length.That's topped with sauteed rapini, on top of which, is the melted provolone. If you're unfamiliar with rapini, it's a bright when sauteed, dark green veg I can only explain as a cross between broccoli and spinach, with the flavor of the preceeding, plus maybe, seaweed. Oh yeah, it has a pleasantly bitter finish as well. While I like the stuff, there was way too  much of it. A third of the way through, I deconstructed the sandwich by removing two-thirds of the  greens, and that suited me. At one point, I thought the meat could have been sliced a tad thicker and would have benefitted with just a kiss from the grill, and a sprinkle of good quality black pepper (plenty of red flake shakers around ) but overall, very satisfying.    Ditto the salad. I was surprised that there was only one option  on dressing, (balsamic vinagrette) which would wear thin after repeat visits, but this time it worked beautifully with the wonderfully fresh, ripe, balanced, and proportioned ingredients. I initially thought the shaved parm was stingy, but I later realized that it was perfect, and came to appreciate the restraint. I don't remember when a simple salad last caused me to comment on it.    Ambience-Neutral   Service-OK   Used tables/chairs looked imported all the way from the other restaurant, the seriously glum dude slicing meat wasn't into eye contact at all; at least not this Monday morning. That's ok, it was too early for a rousing rendition of \"O Solo Mio\" anyway. My counter girl had to refer back to the menu to find the corresponding register key for my sandwich after an incorrect entry. No biggie at all. When I asked how long they've been open she wasn't sure if it was two, or three weeks. No complaint; just observing the hired help doing their jobs.    Here's a weird note on the dessert case near the side door. Most are $5, but there's a tiny, two-bite cannoli for $2. I'd planned on Isabelle's Rum Baba, but when I saw the Tiramisu on the top shelf, my appetite for their sweets took a sharp detour to the left. (like hearing a former lovers name at the critical moment) I could only hope that it was a display-only item, as the coffee powder on top was striated from the cake beneath, (like an Arizona riverbed in summer) the plate was messy (as though the cake had skidded to a stop) and an entire edge  appeared to be chewed away. (no kidding) This thing looked as though it was born on that first day and looked dry enough for me to postpone a purchase at least  temporarily.  Everything in the case was now, for me, suddenly suspect . FYI.   All in all a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Stars may be added, as earned. Hope they stick around for awhile.    Finally, if you don't know what \"Salumeria\" means, here's the def: \"pizzecheria negozio di salumi. \" Got that?    Not speaking the language, my imaginary translation is \" the place you negotiate the salami.\" Makes sense in the deli context. Choose your own.",

    "text": "I want to like Aiello's, I really do. It's close to home, and lord knows, this area really needs some good neighborhood Cafe's. Sigh. I'm partially Italian, originally from upstate NY, and spent 30+ yrs in the SF Bay Area. The interior is pleasant enough, as are all the employees I've encountered, but it has more of a cafeteria feel than a restaurant. I'm used to Italian Delis being crammed with products, and am consistently puzzled by the bare looking messy deli cases. I also didn't even know they had a dessert type case until my 4th visit as its in the back and unseen unless you're on the way to the bathroom. 4 times now I've wanted to order the stuffed artichoke, but they were out, as they seem to be on a lot of items every time I've gone. I've had the chicken Caesar, it was ok. Last nite I stopped in quickly to grab something to take home. I winced at the price of the lasagna in the case ($12), but I was tired, so....Oh, they were out of artichokes, again. I was told they had run out the day before. I wondered why they had not made more. Anyway, back to the lasagna. I asked if it contained meat (I wanted meat) and was told yes. I refuse to eat veal from humatarian reasons, and was told there was no veal in it, although, it will prevent me from trying their meatballs. I was puzzled as to why, when I placed an order to go, I was not asked if I wanted the lasagna hot or cold. I had expected them to give me one of the pieces in the deli case, and I'd be on my way. Instead, I waited over 10 Min. And received it hot. This turned out to be the worst lasagna I've ever had. Stoffers is better. The gravy was not a gravy, it tasted more like they just shredded canned tomatoes and called it a day. There were no spices, and it had a raw, canned flavor. There was no cheese, except for the slab on the top. I did want to eat enough that I didn't have to fix something else, so I searched for the meat, which was very hard to find. I literally could not eat this. What a waste of $12. I've also had the chicken Marsala (rubber) and the pasta pomodoro (bland, tasteless). The pizza is ok,but again, the sauce is bland and canned tasting. It's great that they deliver, but with only one giant sized pizza option available, it's not really an option for just 1 or 2 people. I'm sorry, but I'll never get to taste the artichoke as I won't be going back.",

    "text": "Being from Brooklyn, NY, I'm a tough sell on Italian food.  My family and I decided to try a few different dishes (take out) so we could make a really fair assessment and I was very happily surprised.  We ordered an antipasto salad that had the best prosciutto I've had since being in AZ. It was a little heavy on the greens, but all the meats and cheeses were fresh and tasty and the veggies like roasted red pepper and artichoke hearts were plentiful and delicious.  We also got an order of rice balls. They were good--we don't really like them with peas, which is a pretty standard way of serving them, but they were still tasty.  I don't eat escarole and beans, but my mother said it was spot on and absolutely delicious.  We got 6 garlic knots and they were ok, a little bigger and doughier than I usually like, but again, good flavor. We ordered a chicken parm hero which was really good; flavorful and not too saucy (if you like it \"wetter\" you should specify because it came really dry) and the chicken was obviously fresh.   The meatballs came per \"ball\" so we ordered 3....my husband is the meatball connoisseur and he was satisfied with them--not the best he's ever had, but very very good.  A large pizza finished up the order, and that's where I'm really hard nosed. It was o.k. It's impossible to get a good east coast/ny crust out here. I'm resigned to that.  It has good flavor, the sauce and cheese were very very good and the crust was probably the 3rd or 4th best I've had out here.  We'll definitely be ordering again to try out their dinner specials and the ultimate test:  how thin is the veal cutlet? :)",

Unfortunately there is no shade 100 % sunshine, ouch. We were seated promptly as we arrived. The server was very attentive to our needs. We ordered dinner and within no time the meals were delivered promptly after the appetizers were delivered. The owners came to our table a couple of times to make sure we were okay and if we needed anything. They were very pleasant. One of our meals was 86 or not available in restaurant talk.  So the chef owner came out and offered my mother another menu choice. She choose shrimp sauteed in lemon, garlic and oil. The chef competes the meal, nice gesture. We ordered desert and the custard desert was unavailable as well. When you have a great restaurant it's hard to keep every item in house over a weekend. The server came to our table and asked us to pick a number between 1 and 90 and we choose 47. Guess what winner, winner chicken dinner. Actually not chicken our choice of 4 free meals at our next visit, NICE.  Nice place liking forward to my next visit.",

We came here this past Saturday night and found it to be both inviting and fun. Mind you, there's only two dozen seats inside, so make reservations.  Their overflow seating is plentiful outside, on their sidewalk patio. But you need to be inside, to enjoy that Italian grotto atmosphere.   Both Joe and Myrah run the place. Joe runs the back of the house, including their pizzeria/ deli nextdoor. Ever watchful Myrah (and their daughters?) makes sure no one's water or wine glass is left unfilled in front.   We started with an order of Caprese ($9.00), which they split for us. You could tell by the taste, it was freshly made. Nice!  Oooohhhhhh and their bread that they bring to your table is incredible and it comes with a sliced spicy pepper.  Now that's east coast Italian!   For dinner, the three of us ordered the Chicken Parmigiana ($17.00), the Chicken Florentina ($17.00) and Gnocchi Pesto ($16.00).  All were very tasty, but we really liked the Parma the best. It's red marinara gravy was flavorful and not bitter, while the chicken was incredibly tender.   For dessert, we shared a light Cannoli ($6.00) and their outstanding Chocolate Mousse Torta ($7.00). Wow, you need to save room for that chocolate cake. Really. A must!  Our bill ran $78.19 including taxes, but before gratuities.   We'll be back. Tutti, Mangia!",

    "text": "We were looking for a place to go for our anniversary and I stumbled across Aiello's in my internet search.  Being from the east coast, it caught my eye.  I reviewed the menu and other Yelp reviews and it sounded right up our alley, so I made a reservation (probably not really needed on a Tuesday night).    The place is small, probably less than 20 tables inside.  (They do have outside seating, but a little warm to sit outside in June.)  Service was great.  Not rushed, and not too slow either.    We started with the calamari fritti.  We are big calamari fans, so we tend to order this whenever we get the chance.  It came with a fra diavolo sauce which definitely added some kick.  The calamari was nicely fried and the batter was perfect - not too heavy so he had a good flavor.    For dinner, I had the spaghetti vongola (aka clams) with red sauce.  Clams were cooked perfectly.  I'll admit - I was a bit nervous about clams in the desert, but these were delicious.  (I took my leftovers home and I'm actually eating them for lunch now as I type this.)  My husband ordered the linguine fra diavolo.  He loved it.  He said the spice level wasn't overwhelming so he was able to taste everything without feeling like his mouth was on fire.  And the clams, mussels, shrimp and calamari were all cooked perfectly too.    We ordered dessert to go - chocolate mousse torta for me and NY cheesecake for him - and enjoyed them at home later last night.  Again, delicious.    Before we left, my husband grabbed a takeout menu because we definitely want to try Isa's pizza (which is located right next door - through a connecting door), maybe even as soon as this weekend.  And we'll also be looking to try out Char in the near future too.  Aiello's is tiny, yet upscale.  And prices are about what you'd expect to pay for good Italian food from back east.  Oh, and maybe you'll get lucky and get your meal pretty much for free.  They ask you for a number between 1 and 90 and if your number comes up, you win.  Alas, we chose 14 since it was our 14th anniversary, and we didn't win.  We should have just gone with my husband's lucky number...because that is what came out.  Oh well...better luck next time - and yes, there will be a next time.",

We had a wonderful meal...definitely aptly named because it was one of the best Italian meals since leaving the east coast.  Met the chef, the staff was very attentive but not overbearing. It was a great night out for all of us. We will be sure to come back.   So tonight was my third visit and I remain solidly impressed!  Waitress was attentive with beverage refills, offered another basket of their delicious warm, fresh focaccia bread.  The four of us enjoyed our meals and great conversation. The best part is that we could have a good conversation without the distraction of loud music. There was music but it low enough to allow for a good visit.",

I'm posting my review after I took the time to call the restaurant to let them know that the food I brought home (their restaurant is literally around the block from my home off Thunderbird Rd.) was cold. The owner became belligerent and pissy with me over the phone. That's even worse than cold food, in my book. If my food was truly cooked to order, it would've been steaming hot (or at least warm all the way through), instead of cold inside. I appreciate the gesture of rescinding the charge on my credit card, but a better gesture would have been to feign (that means pretend) appreciation to me when I took the time to call.",

The inside was very romantic, especially when the sun went down. Candlelit. Classical music. Beautiful.  The wine was delicious. The bread and olive oil, which is spicey because they do put red peppers in, to start was wonderful. The food was super tasty and, because I'm a tiramisu person, that was also very delicious.  One of the cool things is both the owner and chef took the time to come out and say hi and make sure all the food was to our liking. They were both very friendly and seemed to be well liked by everyone there.  Then when our bill came (and I don't know if they do this every night), our waitress had us choose a number from 1-99 and if that number came out, our dinner, minus the cost of my glass of wine, was free. We didnt get the number but even so, our dinner was reasonably priced.  Definitely a great date night spot if your looking for a chill place just to relax and have great food with great conversation.",

The \"house\" sandwich and meatball sub was amazing.  The house salad was OK, you really can't ruin salad can you?   Most amazing was the Arancini or rice balls. delicious and full of great texture, it could have been a meal on its own.  This place is pretty amazing.

The Salumeria sandwich was assorted Italian lunch meats that were unusually mild for Italian meat and cheese that had little flavor . This sandwich seemed to  lack seasoning or dressing . The salad on the side was good .  I had the grilled chicken sandwich I did enjoy the taste of the char on the vegetables and chicken but  the chicken was dry , bread wasn't toasted and also this sandwich lacked seasoning and dressing . You might ask why didn't I just get up and ask for some vinegar and oil and my answer is after taking two bites I thought it wasn't worth getting up for a tiny end of sandwich ( this was a half sandwich ) . This sandwich even with grilled vegetables seemed very dry .They do say they are East Coast Style but  no hot Cherry Peppers in store can't be an East Coast sandwich without hot cherry peppers .   If you get a sandwich ask for your oil and vinegar on the side so you can add it if you feel your sandwich needs flavor .  I saw Rice balls  (arancini) and Stuffed Artichokes that looked really good in the case  and would have purchased to try at home if I was going straight home but I wasn't maybe I would have given more stars if that is what I tried . Two stars isn't saying don't go here .   I think this small comfortable casual place has potential so give them a try maybe they are still working things out .",

I read their online menu after purchasing a Groupon and already made up my mind to order the arrancini and eggplant rollatini -- 2 of my deli favorites.  The rice ball didn't have much flavor and was way too big -- the size of a large softball. Although it was stuffed with the usual tasty fare it just couldn't compete with the amount of rice. The marinara that topped it was quite good.  The rollatini was good, but served barely warm. A dish like this should be served hot and melty. It made me think it might have been laying around a while and nuked. Yikes, I hope not.  My husband ordered a veal parm sub. All of the elements were good -- the bread, cheese, sauce -- except for the veal itself. He said it was just one of those weird Arizona type cuts of meat -- if you know what I mean...  I'm going to give Aiellos Salumeria one more chance and order a deli sandwich and antipasta next time.  The restaurant itself is extremely clean and pleasant.",

They have a variety of legit pastas too. I got the special and it comes with a salad and cannoli and warm bread. All was delicious.  The Caesar salad dressing was so creamy and just great. They do put a lot on the salad so I'd ask for light if you don't want the salad doused. But the dressing was perfect! The bread came warm and very soft. Also very good. The pasta sauce was great but the pasta itself was mediocre. The pasta was not cooked al dente which was surprising to me since everything else was great. Cooking pasta al dente does not seem too hard. 9mins in boiling water sounds very straight forward to me... Anyways it was still tasty and I would still come back because everything from the service of the friendly workers to the taste was great. The food came out all at once and was very fast. I just wish they would put more effort into making that pasta al dente! I would give this place a hands down 5 stars besides that.",

    "text": "As an East Coast 1st generation Italian, I was very excited to see a more casual version of Aiello's open very close to me, and on my way home from work no less.  I can tell this place will be trouble for my waistline.  Salumeria means a store that sells cold cuts, meats, etc.  Aiello's does that and more.  I've only had a sampling of their food so far and just based on the Sfogliatelle in the dessert case, I'm in love.  Caprese Paninni - absolutely delightful focaccia bread, fresh mozzarella, basil that smelled and tasted like it had just been picked and juicy tomatoes.  Divine.  Anitpasto Salad - real Italian meats and cheeses, not those weird little sliced bundles of rolled up American meats and cheeses like you find at other places.  This salad was peppered with whole slices of imported Italian meats and a beautiful blend of greens and artichoke hearts.  Arancini - OK, I love these!  My Mom used to make them occasionally so I was thrilled to find them on their menu.  It's delicious!  A huge stuffed ball of rice in tomato sauce.  Way too big for me to finish so I am enjoying it for breakfast as I type this.  Now, to the item that will most get me in trouble! Sfogliatelle - In Italian this word means \"many leaves\" and that is what this pastry looks like. Some call it Lobster Tails..I call it by it's traditional name.  You have an option of two different fillings.  One is similar to cannolli filling...YUM.....the other is a sweet ricotta with citron...DOUBLE  YUM....  At almost 500 calories a pop, I'll really have to restrain myself or hit bootcamp twice a day!  Honestly haven't had Sfogliatelle this good since I left the East Coast.  Aiello's Salumeria, I will be back and am very much looking forward to it.  There's nothin' better than a little midweek Italian foodgasm!",

At least we had a Groupon so it wasn't too bad price wise, if we hadn't I would classify them as being a tad expensive for what you get. I had the wild mushroom rigatoni and it was fine, nothing special nor memorable.  My buddy had chicken parm which was beyond overdone, but the sauce was decent.  The deli case has all the meat seemingly just thrown in there very unorganized and difficult to see whats what and how much it costs.",

They have very limited sittings but we were there during lunch time and most people were ordering their food for take-out so it must not get full often.   I had their veal meatball spaghetti and it was very delicious. The meatball was very juicy and flavorful. The two large meatballs were accompanied by a generous portion of spaghetti and a piece of garlic bread. My boyfriend ordered their veal parmesan, which was served as two large pieces AND more spaghetti. The portions are definitely more than enough for a meal. The price is a little on the pricey end for a simple dish but we had a Groupon so managed to save about 33%.   Their dishes were good but not a place we would purposely drive to Phoenix for. It would be a good place to go to if we are around the area again.",

    "text": "First time here--for lunch.  After ordering, we got some fresh breads and an olive oil/roasted pepper mixture which was delicious with the bread.  Had some spiciness to it but nothing that would keep you from eating it.  Very lovely and very complimentary!  Quick with the waters too.  The lunches are quite reasonably priced.  $8 for their spaghetti and meatballs.  The meatballs have the reputation (according to the menu) of being NYC's best.  A nice salad of mixed greens came with it with two cherry tomatoes.  Balsamic was just right.  My dining companion ordered a chicken and eggplant sandwich with a spicy marinara sauce which came with a salad on the side.    My spaghetti and meatball (yes, ONE mountainous  meatball) presented very well. I tasted the pasta and it was AL DENTE--not overcooked and the red sauce was very good--not sweet.  I hate sweet sauces.  Save the sweetness for desserts not for pasta sauce.  The impressive meatball was made of veal and pork and while it was not a bad meatball texture and taste wise, it was not the explosion of flavor that I expect from a really good meatball. So NYC's best it cannot be.   I ate all the pasta and 3/4 of the meatball--it was that large.  The chicken & eggplant sandwich was pretty decent and they made the sauce spicy just as we asked.   Dana, our delightful server, made sure the service moved nicely, that we had our waters filled, and answered all our questions about the menu.  I have not run into such an amiable and competent server all rolled into one in a long time.  Thank you Dana.  You made our first lunch at Aiello's quite enjoyable.",

Antipasto of eggplant rolatini, which can be difficult to prepare, was very good. I should mention bread with an exceptional spiced olive oil was very flavorful. Loved the red pepperoncini. One of the specials that stood out, veal saltimbocca had a very good combination of flavors and texture. A regular entre, chicken parmigiana, was well prepared and came with a side of pasta that was slightly overcooked. OK, to me, the star of the show was dessert. Zabaglione, where can you find this? Worth the trip alone! Our server Claudia, was excellent, very attentive without being overbearing. A True asset to the restaurant. Good food, excellent service, well worth the trip from Scottsdale.

    "text": "Reading the sad news about Aiello's closing their Central Ave. location reminded me to share the good news about this place. So... Aiello fans, take heed: You have an alternative and it is GOOD!!  I had the. best. stuffed artichoke I've had in a looooong time here (see photo) and, for that, I am a devoted fan! The artichoke was giant and must've weighed at least 2 pounds stuffed! I also enjoyed the eggplant rollatini - the eggplant was soft and sweet and LOADED with ricotta filling. The sauce had the perfect acidity. Seriously, for as big of a fan as I am of the food and as convenient as it is -- it's dangerously close to home!   The adjacent pizza place has a white pizza that's on my list! Looks PERFECT but can't fully vouch for it... yet! ;)",

    "text": "Love this place! I don't even know where to start. I have two favorite Italian places: Aiello's and a place in Europe. The staff is fantastic and you will always get a hello from the owner Joe. The food is out of this world and I have almost everything on the menu. My favorite is the salmon pasta dish. At first didn't think I would like it; however, I was blown away by how light and delicious it was. My recommendation is start with an appetizer - the mussels are unbelievable - then the salmon dish (or the chicken Marsala), and end it with an espresso with a fresh made cannoli. I have taken many friends here and they have fallen in love with it to the point they have been referring it.",

The food was delectable, and they were very caring when it came to dietary or allergic restrictions. I recommend this to anyone looking for a nice family meals. Also the bread rolls are SO GOOD! Might I add we got a piece of Italian cheesecake on the house!",

For pasta, I like to get pappardelle with chicken and vodka sauce. It's not on the menu so I get fettuccine but sub the noodles, hold the red peppers. The spaghetti carbonara was indulgent and rich, but not too heavy.   Even the bread with hot oil is worth the calories.   For dessert, the cannolis are my favorite.  Good service every time, reasonable wait for to go orders.  Right next door to Isa's pizza.   I guess the only reason for 4/5 is the location. It's alright. No complaints. Just not that extra something special.",

    "text": "Our good friend took my husband and I to Aiello's two nights ago.  When we waked in, we were greeted right away by a hostess and seated at the bar until a table was free.  Dana was tending bar and was very accommodating.  While at the bar, we were approached by the owner Joe, who asked how we were doing and if we were okay.  We talked to him for a few minutes and had a great conversation.  Then Joe's wife Mahyra (spelling?) came over and talked to us.  Again, all very nice people.  When our table was ready we sat down and ordered drinks and appetizers.  The Calamari Fritti was soooooo good!!!  The breading was light and tasty.  I didn't drink much wine, but hubby and our friend raved about it.  We were served bread and olive oil with peppers to dip the bread in.  All of it was amazing!  We were happy campers at this point.  We ordered our dinners:  I ordered the Chicken Maria, husband ordered the Linguini Fradiavolo and our friend ordered Veal Marsala.  Mine came with a decent serving of chicken breast (covered in mushrooms and artichokes topped with lemon & white wine sauce), green beans and a potato croquette, it was very tasty.  I was very satisfied and will definitely order it again.  Husband's dinner was really good, he said.  The only thing he would have changed was the portion, which was small compared to what he received at other restaurants.  Our friend really liked his veal, which he has had there before.  All three of us cleaned our plates!    On to dessert.  OMG the dessert!!  Husband and I shared the Tiramisu, which I wish was a little bigger.  It was so incredibly creamy and tasty.  I could have eaten 10 of them!  Our friend had the Chilled Zabaglione, which I've never heard of so he offered me a taste.  I was ready to order one of those next!  It was heavenly, to say the very least.  WHEN we go back there, I honestly will order everything I ordered this time and add the Chilled Zabaglione to my order.  Overall, it was a very satisfying experience.  The ambiance was great, the owners are engaging and very nice, our server Dana was great, and the food and dessert was amazing.  We will definitely be back!  We live in Fountain Hills but will think nothing of taking the drive to Aiello's for another great experience!",

    "text": "This place started off so promising.  Nice seats out in the patio, the server was friendly and listed their specials for the evening.  At that point, mostly everything went downhill.  Our drinks were never refilled and when they were (after requesting it for the 5th time - no joke), he'd bring our drinks and leave the empty cups on our table - by the end of the night we had about 12 empty cups on our table (party of 6).  Our entree's took ALMOST 2 hours to come out and this was after we already finished our appetizers - which by the way, we started a dirty dish pile at the end of our table since our server never picked them up.  The food was good, but by the time they arrived, most of us lost our appetite - and considering it was near 9:30 pm when they came out.  We had 2 tired kids who were done after sitting for 2 hours already and now had to wait for us to eat.",

Meatball sandwich beautifully presented but meatballs are bready tasting and lack a meaty flavor.  Marinara sauce is a little flat with chunks of tomato.   Ok not great.   Iced tea is delicious and service was 5 stars.  Would come back and try to antipasto salad or ziti.   Skip the meatballs.   Associated pizza restaurant next door.",

I called and placed an order for pick up and once I got back home with my food, I became disappointed. The serving size of pasta was adequate and included 2 meatballs, but I was given 2 pieces of bread that were completely burnt black and hard as bricks. Dipping bread into the pasta sauce is one of my favorite parts, and this bread wasn't even edible. I decided to dig into the pasta and meatballs, and I couldn't have been unhappier. It had no flavor and was completely lack luster. The meat balls were very tender...but that was all they had going. When I say they had no flavor, I truly mean it. Just the spaghetti and meatballs cost over $15. I could have gone to Olive Garden for cheaper and it would have been tastier.",
