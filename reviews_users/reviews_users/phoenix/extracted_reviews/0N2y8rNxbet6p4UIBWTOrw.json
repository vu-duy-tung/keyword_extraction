    "text": "This is hands down my family's favorite Greek restaurant.  It's a family-run place in a strip mall but so, so much more than the location and the sparse decor.  The best way to sum up the place is what the lovely woman who works the counter once told my mother: \"We make everything with love.  You have to make money to stay open, of course, but it's the love that keeps people coming back .  You can tell when there's love in the food.\"  I love the warmth of this place, Greek music and all.  The made-to-order gyros is the thing to get, a sandwich for a big meal and the plate for a huuuge meal.  The meat is hot and fresh (which is not always the case at Greek sandwich places) and the vegetables are crispy.  The fries are always piping hot.  The falafel is also great.  Eat here and eat here often.  Know that there's someone in SF that wishes he were in your place as you hungrily eye your neighbor's ramekin of tzaziki sauce...  Beware!  The place closes at 8 and sometimes by 7:30.  All good things...",

I thought it would be like any other chicken pita but i was wrong. The chicken was very moist and the flavor was damn good. There sauce actually had good flavor to it since other places I've had we're very bland.   My friend got the chicken kabob plate, which for 8.99 was HUGE. He got a salad then a huge thing of rice, huge chunks of chicken and some toasted pita bread. Well worth it, this thing could probably feed 2 people.   The rice they have is great and the pitas were not over cooked/toasted.   The only draw back is during lunch it can get cramped in there and the Pepsi seemed alittle sweeter than it should be. But those are very small problems.   I would come back again when I'm in the area.",

Also, the souvlaki is amazing, and the dolmas are delicious!  Personally I get a gyro salad to go on my way home from the gym 9/10 times I come, but i also try to change it up and I've yet to come across something on their menu that wasn't delicious!",

They have tons of regulars because the food keeps them coming back. The hummus is to die for (it only comes with one pita however, so I always order 2-3 extra). I have also tried their veggie gyro which is great. I have brought many meat-loving friends here and I've never heard anything but great things about their experience with their food.   The staff is completely Greek. They are friendly in their own unique kind of way. Because I usually saunter in with a drink from Starbucks (same parking lot), the female owner assumes I work there and she always asks me how business is going at SB. I corrected her the first few times, but she continued to ask, so now I just keep it going and tell her it's going great but that I hate my job (because I'm assuming I would, if I worked there). I love her personality...very intense. Never smiles, even when a smile would be just right. But she is still very kind. Always look forward to seeing her and eating her food.",

    "text": "My hubby and I decided to check this place out, since we were on this side of town and really wanted some gyros.  It came suggested to us by a co-worker of his, so we figured it would be delicious!  It wasn't...  It's a small place with about 8-9 tables, which I don't have any problem with.  If it's good, it shouldn't matter how big or small a place is.  We ordered our food and sat down.  The woman at the counter was quite nice and seemed very helpful.  We started with the hummus, which was wonderful.  That's the main reason I didn't give them 1 star.  The pita served with it was warm and soft.  We were really looking forward to our gyro combo meals, hoping this was a precursor to the rest of the meal.  Well, here I go...the gyros were hot and really full of meat.  My mouth was watering at the thought of biting into it.  Then, I did.  The tzatziki sauce didn't taste right.  It was all dill, and had no hint of a cucumber flavor, which I normally find so refreshing in a gyro.  Not only that, but it was so oily, it kept separating at the bottom of the pita.  Then, there's the meat.  I found it greasy and bland.  I like juicy gyro meat, but I also like when you get a bit of the crust from the outside.  I went to taste a bit of the crust, and it dripped grease on my finger and felt spongy.  It seemed very unappetizing.  I'm a meat-eater, and would usually have eaten every last bit of it, but I ended up pulling most of it out of the pita (which was the best part of it) and dipping it into the rest of our hummus.    And, finally, the fries on the side.  They were soggy, so I didn't eat any of them.  I've read over the other reviews, and I guess gyros really are a matter of taste.  We won't be returning here, and will keep going to our main gyro restaurant.  But, we also won't stop looking for other really good gyros around town.",

When I walk in, I'm asked: \"Do you want the usual?\"  I say yes, and the order comes out right every time!  (I get the \"#1 Gyro combo\", btw!)   The gyros always come out perfect!  The portions are generous, and I never leave hungry!   I've been to so many Mediterranean restaurants... but this is THE REAL DEAL!  I often take friends to King Gyro and they are blown away too!

Now, I'm always greeted by smiling faces and questions about school, my family, and the like. They are fantastic people. Perhaps it is a cultural difference?   The food is what keeps me coming back. Absolutely in love with their gyros. The meat, veggies, and pita taste fresh and never over cooked. Fries are okay, nothing special but that doesn't bother me because I go for the gyros.

The chicken was spongy as if had been sitting in a bucket of water.   My toddler and I shared the chicken kabob plate. The rice was extremely salty and tasted like Top Ramen rice. The chicken tasted old and was greasy.   We all shared an order of hummus, which was bland and was drowning in oil that created a less than desirable after taste.   I am glad this was not our first experience tasting Greek Food because it would have been our last. As for now we will stick to our fav. place down the street from here.

The meat is always moist and delicious and you get tons of it whether you order the gyro sandwich, salad or plate. The pitas are soft and fluffy. The taziki is so flavorful you'll find yourself asking for extra just to make sure every bite is coated in it. It's a family-owned business that's makes you feel like family when you dine there. I always see lots of Greek people eating at this restaurant which is always a good sign! I took my 20 month old granddaughter to eat there twice in the last couple weeks and she demolished the gyro meat and all but ignored her french fries, which are good too, so you know it's got to be tasty.",

I was happy right away when I walked in to see how clean this place is.  The people were friendly and helpful.  I ordered the Chicken Fajita (Middle Eastern Style) and have never tasted anything so good.  I got mine without the Pita but my husband got his with and loved it.  Ive been there three times now even though we live and work on the other side of town.  Will go back again as a special treat.  Seems like there a quite of few regulars there and it's like a neighborhood meeting spot.  Loved it!  Highly recommend :)",

I felt like a dine-in order would deserve better than a styrofoam plate and they certainly skimped on the fries on this occasion but the falafel was well cooked and the sandwich had a lot of fresh/pickled veggies included. The tzatziki sauce was delicious but kinda ran down the sandwich making the first bites dry and the latter ones a bit runny but overall I would recommend this place and I'm definitely gonna try it out again in the future.",

I have brought friends and family here because of it (plus the food of course), and I get asked every time I go about how they are doing or about how my life is going. She remembers great details about her customers, and now-a-days that's a rare find. She knows exactly what I am going to order (Yes, I'm predictable) and has it already written on a ticket before I'm at the counter. Just amazing personable service.   Now to the food, which is just as amazing. If you enjoy a classic gyro, that's what got me hooked in the first place. The Tzatziki Sauce is flavorful, and sauce like, not thick, and has been the best I have tasted. I love getting an extra side and dipping my fries in it or pouring it on my rice. If you want to try something a little different get my favorite which is the steak pita. The steak is marinated in some delicious concoction,  and its won me for good. They have plenty of other options for people who aren't adventurous in the food category, like hamburgers and what-not, but I haven't had them. I would only imagine they are tastey if that's what you are going for ;)",

All the usual suspects were involved, but the chicken was spiced and sliced perfectly and tucked into a pita wrap with good dill sauce, lettuce and other veggies. The pita came with hot fries and was served by the nice female owner of the place. This was a random stop while working one day in the area. This is the only time I feel bad a restaurant is not a chain because it is far from East valley. It only costs seven bucks too and most patrons were talking greek, so you knew you were eating in the right place.",

The colorful and friendly personalities of the staff are right out of a Seinfeld episode. The owner and his wife are frequently interacting with the customers to make sure that your meal is satisfying to you palate. Home cooking and conviviality are the trademarks of this diamond in the ruff.",

I see no need for there being any \"rest of the menu\".  Passed this place a dozen times over the past several years but wasn't hungry/wasn't meal time  or they were closed, but finally was passing by at mealtime, starving - and they were open.   I don't know how \"authentic\" a \"sirloin gyro\" is - I don't care - it is without a doubt the absolute best gyro I've ever had.  I've paid more for others in settings with more of that \"sophisticated ambience\" bidness, but this place has its own \"family-run lunch counter\" lack of pretentiousness, including the Greek travel posters that's an ambience in it's own worthy right.  But that joyous gyro - man, that thing is good! Stuffed full and absolutely overflowing with strips of incredibly tasty marinated beef - never had one quite like it.  Friendly folk behind the counter brought food to our table outside the front door - inquiring as to how good it was -with clearl pride in product.  Came w/fries which were fine - but that sirloin gyro - mmm - makes this little place worthy of being your destination rather than an afterthought when in the hood.",

Sure, I said, not expecting anything spectacular but needing sustenance for the 3+ hour tattoo I was about to get.   What a surprise! I'm judging on the one meal that I had but Holy Sheep the Veggie Pita is to die for, Veg lovers!  The veggies tasted fresh and yummy and not all mushy. The red sauce, I'm not sure what it is but will have to find out, was so dang flavorable.   The flavor? Amazing. My taste buds were ecstatic.  If they can make a near-vegetarian girl happy and they're not even a vegetarian restaurant, I imagine the omnivores will make out like bandits here as well. New fan for life and very glad there is actually another decent veg-friendly restaurant on the West Siiii----eed!!!  UPDATE: The next time I went, it was just like a curry sauce, no red sauce. Huh? Not as tasty",

She offered a generous sample of the gyro meat with the tzatki (sp) sauce. I never liked lamb, but this was very tasty! My family has ordered assorted dishes, of the assorted meat plate with rice and veggies, soulvaki, pork pita, steak sandwhich/pita,and I had the chicken pita and the chicken salad. The food here is fresh and home made. I love the sauce and always end up getting extra. The bread is wonderful and I would order a second pita for an extra .70 cents! All the meat was perfectly seasoned, juicy and delicious. The vegetables were fresh and no sign of browing. The place is a casual atmosphere and clean. I learned the lady's name is Oiudad and although she seems stern, she is very nice, the more she gets to know you she warms up. By the end of our last visit, my 26 yr old stepson gave her a big hug. We tried the home made baklava and it is out of this world delicious! This will be a spot we will return to over and over. They even have chicken nuggets, pasta, and hamburgers for the not so adventurous or kidlets to please everyone. I do wish they would get some brewed iced tea to add on the drink menu. That would be the only thing I would change.  But I can overlook that for this gem!",

Whenever I go to a Greek or Mediterranean restaurant, I go for the hummus and falafel first before I decide to get anything else. I order a side order of falafel to taste them without any sauce or anything to interfere with the flavor. The hummus was good but it was the falafel that was really good. I have been to some places where it's just a small, hard and dry hockey puck. These were a generous size (.50 cents each when I got them a la carte with my hummus). They were fried crispy, but were light with a great texture and taste. I can't wait to come back and have them in a pita; and I look forward now to their other dishes. Great little place; glad I found them.",

    "text": "It seems people like this place a lot.  I happened to be making one of my rare trips to this side of town for a doctor's appointment and as part of my quest to discover the wealth of little mom & pop restaurants in the Phoenix area this one popped up in my Yelp search.  I've had some good Gyros and some really awful ones but I'm always open to try something new.  The place itself is pretty plain, in a strip mall with a couple of small metal tables on the sidewalk. Nothing fancy about it. The man at the counter who I'm guessing is the owner's son was nice and an older man, who I'm guessing is the owner, came around to all of the tables to chat. It looks like they get a high percentage of return customers.  I like that there is only one size fountain drink at one set price. I ordered the Gyros with a drink and was automatically given fries. The fries are good but if I had known they were included I would have asked for a side salad or nothing at all ... not a big fries eater.  Suggestion to them is to ask if the customer wants fries.  The Gyros itself is traditional (thankfully) with much more meat than most places serve. The other traditional ingredients include onions, fresh tomato and tzatziki, no lettuce.  The biggest difference is the meat, which is dry and flavorless at so many Greek restaurants. Here it is moist, thick and very flavorful.  My taste buds tell me they use lamb, which has a distinctive taste. Their meat comes from Kronos in Chicago which pretty much has a lock on wholesale Gyros meat distribution.  If you are not in the mood for Gyros this place has a pretty eclectic menu ranging from hamburgers and hot dogs to spaghetti and even catfish filet.  I like and encourage mom & pop restaurants and always try to support them with my business. That doesn't always mean I'll come back if the food or service is bad. King Gyros has their act together and I know I'll be back next time I'm in the neighborhood.",

From the outside King Gyro doesn't look like much, and you need to park around the corner in the strip mall parking lot. However, the inside of King Gyro is very clean, well kept, and inviting.    I'm a huge Gyro fan and insist the word is  pronounced Yee Row. On this visit my lunch companion and I ordered a Steak Gyro and Chicken Cesar Salad, and both entree's were delicious.   The Steak Gyro was huge and filled with meat, this Gyro was big enough to feed two. The sauce was perfect, not too tart and the bread was fresh, warm and delicious. The Chicken Cesar Salad was also very good.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The lettuce was fresh and crisp, and the dressing flavorful.  I would go back there everyday if I lived in that area.",

I arrived at 20 minutes till and parked in front. When I stepped out of the car the owner stepped out and said they were closed. This to me is not the way to run a business. I said it was not 4pm yet and he didn't say much then just walked back in the store. Damn rude if you ask me. Puts me off from going back to this place and I will not recommend it to anyone. Makes me wonder if the lost business was worth going home 20 minutes early.  \"Update\" I went in to King Gyros a few days ago mostly because my mother loves the meat here. Right when I walked in The owner in the back started yelling at the women behind the counter. I was thinking he must read yelp and realized I was the one who gave him a bad review. Turns out he was telling the woman to give me a free gyro because they were closed when I arrived on Christmas eve. He told me he remembered me and apologized for being closed.

    "text": "Greek mafiosos aside, I find King Gyros to be a good cheap lunch grub type of place.    It's a counter style lunch joint (wedged in the Mervyn's shopping center) with tacky Greek beach posters on the wall, classroom carpet, corian tables and cedar chairs.   I come here quite often and usually order a chicken gyro plate with fries or the greek salad, and they're both tasty, cheap and does the job.  In particular I like the gyro sauce with its yogurt sauce, spices and fresh dill.    King Gyros is not exactly a standout type of place, but I find it to be a solid choice if you're in the area.  It can get busy during the day, but last time I was here Nico and Demetri rolled up with their entourage in their club clothes and a pricey Mercedes at 2 PM.  Klassy!",

One of the best gyros I've had and definitely the best on the west side.  Their prices are reasonable.  Two huge gyros, both with fries, and one fountain drink ends up being about $13.  The rest of the menu looks really good, but the gyro is so good I can't get myself to order anything other than that.",

The woman who owned it was so sweet, a Grecian grandma who cared about us. The gyro platter was sooooo addictive. The meat was juicy, tender, and seasoned perfectly and the tzasiki was amazing- complemented the meat beautifully. The pitas were warm and fresh- best I've had. The hummus was oh so garlicky. Smooth and perfectly made. Kids had some yummy hot dogs with fries made fresh. Go here- you will not regret it. We can't wait to try the rest of their extensive menu!",

Today, a huge family decided to take up half of the restaurant, which was very awkward for other patrons. I took my meal to-go today, but sitting in normally isn't too bad.

The restaurant is small and located in a strip mall. When I walked in there was a counter to walk up to and put in your order. I decided on the chicken Greek salad. I had a seat and waiting patiently for my food. There are a few tables inside so you have the option for dine in or take out. It was takeout tonight. I only was waiting about 5 minutes or so if that and I was on my merry way with my salad in tow. I got home and there is a pita sitting on top of the salad. I lift that off to reveal a salad from the gods above. Seriously the dressing on this salad is AMAZING! I don't know what is put in it but it was the most delicious salad I have ever tasted. It was Romain lettuce, tomato, kalamata olives, bell pepper, red onion, cucumbers, feta and grilled chicken that was seasoned to perfection! Oh and cannot forget that house dressing. It was a big salad and I gave the pita and half the salad to my dad. We were both full after but thankfully not that overly stuffed feeling. This could be bad because I have a feeling I will be coming here often and at $10 a salad that will add up. I will definitely be back soon and will be trying other things on the menu. I can't wait until my next King Gyros fix!!!",

Tucked in a shopping center, this place is definitely worth a visit for lunch or a quick bite with friends and family!   I ordered the gyros sandwich because DUH it's KING gyros! You get a choice of side, usually fries or Greek Salad with it. I go for fries when I feel like indulging but this last time I got salad and omg it was so good! I love having olives and feta in my salad. I really want to get onion rings but haven't so far. Definitely will try next time as a side.    The gyros was amazing--cooked well, seasoned perfectly and delicious! It comes with onions and tomatoes and I also got it with extra tzatziki  sauce and I definitely recommend you doing the same. That way you can pick at a couple of gyros and dip in one sauce so your sandwich is easier to fold and take bites of. I pour the extra sauce on the remainder of my sandwich. I added some feta in my sandwich and I really loved it!   Can't wait to come back here again! My man loves the catfish special too he says it's one of his favorite dishes here!",

The meat was delicious although a little saltier & that's pretty much all they use for the gyro. We prefer them with lettuce, onions, tomatoes & a nice sauce. Ours had hardly any onion & no vegetables at all. The taziki sauce was more of a paste or spread & also hardly there. The meat did taste good & there was a lot of it. The fries were ok, but a little on the soggy side...same for their onion rings. We wouldn't rule out trying them again, but would definitely try something else there.",

    "text": "This is one review I feel horrid writing anything negative since the lady owner was so accomodating to us (and actually cared if we liked the food), however, I eat an awful lot of my favorite ethnic food and feel pretty qualified to write on it.   OK, the hummus was really fresh which was a plus but, for me, a tad too much garlic  altho my table companions liked it (so I'll shut up).  Good pita served with it that was toasted just right, tho. The gyros itself and the pita were A+, the tzatziki had a little too much dill in it, and where was the diced cucumber I am so acclimated to in it?  But the tzatzkiki consistency was thickish which is right, because sometimes stores make it way too thin and runny. But the gyro was muy good.  Why do other gyros joints don't have fresh cooked meat like this and their gyros are always so overcooked and burnt?  Not at King Gyros.  Very fresh cooked meat = wonderful and juicy like it's supposed to be. The baklava was good, too, but no nuts made it go somewhat downhill.  I miss the nuts..sorry.  I'd pay for the nuts to be put in it myself. But the gyro meat--and the nice, fresh pita bread--tops!!!  Some of the best cooked gyro meat I've ever had...and they don't skimp on the servings either since you get a really fat portion of meat with none of this fake-you-out-by-using-fillers-like-lots-of-lettuce-on-top stuff.  Worth the trip just to get the gyro, frankly...it's superb!!!!  The BEST I've had here so far! Definitely trying this place again.  I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars, so--in the name of strictly testing (yeah, sure)--I have to come back and re-test all.  See?  Anything for fairness...gawd, but I love that excuse to eat great food.... Prices are very reasonable, by the way.",

I usually go with my brother for lunch and we always order the gyro salad. Well the owner lady now remembers us and just asks \"the usual?\", we laugh and say \"yes please\".  Also don't forget to wave at the guys in the kitchen. They seem always in a great mood! Always smiling, or maybe they just think I'm cute? lol. Either way you can't go wrong with King Gyro, great food and great people!",

The smells drifting from the restaurant were tantalizing.  I ordered the chicken pita and hubby got a chicken sandwich.  Not much difference except mine was in pita bread and he was in a roll.  The Tzatziki sauce had a nice flavor of dill and yogurt.  Both plates came with a serving of fries.  The chicken was flavorful and succulent.  Patrons kept coming in at an early happy r to either dine in or take out.  The food is fresh and owners are Greek and nice.  Prices are definitely affordable in this casual place. Worth the trip if you're in the area.",

Definitely going back and trying something different....",

The owners are always so kind, and welcoming, and there is always just a great atmosphere every time I stop by. Most people can not taste the difference with Gyros, but I have to say they have the best Gyro meat. Their tzatziki sauce is probably one of my favorite things about the place. It just makes everything better! Their Chicken Pita sandwich is also always amazing. Their spices and ingredients are what makes their restaurant stand out. I will continue to come to king gyros while I live in Phoenix at least once a week. Go and try it out for yourselves, I promise you will not be disappointed!",

It tastes fresh with Roma tomatoes and the sauce is very lightly applied, but it's a good thing: trust me. The portion is huge! Then the garlic bread is the perfect amount to really sop up what's left over.  End the meal with some baklava and mm, perfect meal!   Plus it seems to be family owned. I don't eat there often but I'm still recognized every time I come in. Service is excellent, everyone is very nice - even when they are very busy and the restaurant is filled up!",

    "text": "The ambiance is alright. It's a strip mall gyro shop. Nothing special about it. The staff exists, takes your order, and will even bring it to you, but they fail to make that little bit of connection.   That's not really True though, it's more that they don't try.  They take your order, they make your food, and bring it to you though, they're not rude or mean or anything of that sort. Just bored, and for some reason I found their indifference extremely off putting.  The food is good. Middle of the road. Just a gyro pita should be. The meat tastes good. It's sliced well. There's not a lot of it, so value suffers, but that's alright. The pita is somewhat dry, but again, not bad. It tastes fine, just not as soft and fluffy as I hoped. The fries are good and they serve a lot of them.  If I'm nearby, I'll go here. But I won't go out of my way, and it's definitely not a must have. DON'T AVOID THIS PLACE, it's perfectly fine. but that's all it is",
