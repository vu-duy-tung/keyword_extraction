There's nothing more unappealing than warm shrivel up tomatoes. I also asked for extra basil, as I always do, which usually results in whole leaves of basil on my sandwich. Today it didn't appear to have any extra just thinly sliced slivers of basil laying next to the wilted hot tomatoes. Thank God their tabouli  is still to die for. I got my order to go and I should have none something was amiss when condensation was obvious inside the To Go box. And while the the thin strips of dressing on the outside of the bread may look good, they certainly make for oily hands.",

Food here is great and very healthy (then again, I eat a 3.99 bag of chips by myself every other day so my definition of 'healthy' may not be yours).  Portions here are very reasonable and it is enough to get you to that \"good\" feeling of satisfaction.    Atmosphere has a mix of college students and older crowd.",

DRINKS:  For those vegans or with food allergies, they have Soy, Almond, and Rice Milk.  While the americano and cappucino are good, the Green Tea Smash and Dark Chocolate Smash with almond milk are my favorites!  FOOD:  I've  had the Hummus and Tabouleh, a Turkey Cranberry Sandwhich, and a Pear & Jam Flatbread that was all amazing!  Also, they have lots of Gluten Free pastries (GF cookies, biscotti, twinkies).",

Though the location is a plus, the real reason I have become a regular is that they open earlier than Lux - 6 am - and have free WiFi. During a two month string of early morning test prep, the openers remembered me and asked about my progress on a daily basis.  My favorite part about Urban Bean is that ALL of their products are compostable and they run a compost in the back.   The only reason I didn't give five stars is because they have yet to add large tables (for two or three people to spread out books to study). Other than that - it's my fave!",

They must have heard that people were having a poor experience with regard to service because the guy helping me out was really friendly and talked with me for a bit about the different teas they offer.   I saw that they also offer food/wine tastings on certain nights. The chef who coordinates this was also the barista who took my drink order.   I agree with everyone that says the interior needs some renovation. I like the bright open space but some reading chairs and more wall decoration would certainly spruce the place up! All in all, it's a close, locally owned place that I'll be sure to stop by again when I need to.",

    "text": "Cute! I love another independent coffee shop in my neck of the woods. The people working there were friendly, but not ingratiatingly so. The menu and prices - on par with other coffee shops. I had to try something to eat, but none of the baked goods had mad shelf appeal. I went for the cardamom coffee cake, which looked about as exciting as burnt white toast. Appearances are deceiving! A sweet, milky vanilla-caramel cake with a thick ribbon of dense, concentrated cinnamon based spice running throughout, all with a thin and barely perceptible glaze on top. Yum yum yum! A little greasy and so definitely not on my every day meal plan, but this will serve nicely for a treat every now and again.   The coffee is average, but I'm no coffee snob. (I am baffled by those who suggest the barista should \"learn to pull a good shot\". WTF?) It's not Starbucks-burnt, so it works for me.   The girl working there (I assume one of the owners) said Fox 10 News was out there yesterday morning, doing a remote report. Cool! I hope it brings them lots of business. It's a good location, in a little strip mall that also has an Aveda salon (who knew?), and just a little out of my way in the mornings. Oh yeah, and they were actually open when I got there a little after 6:30. What's up with coffee shops that don't open until 7 (or later!!!)? I will definitely be adding Urban Beans to my list of morning coffee sources.",

The feel of the place is hip/trendy (maybe a little cluttered. Not sure what the deal is with the wine bar) and they have a decent patio out front where the traffic noise from 7th St gets decently muffled by trees and the surrounding wall. The folks who work here in my experience so far are genuinely nice and take their work seriously. Early morning crew better? The bad. The service can be really slow at times. The barristas do take their work seriously, but sometimes the supurfluous chatter causes back-ups. I really want to like the coffee here, but it just tastes, well, bad. I'm not some kind of java expert but I know when my palate is unhappy. I've tried many different brews and types trying to find a happy compromise, but to no avail. In addition the prices are a bit on the high end in my opinion. Depending on your choice of coffees, the \"large\" ends up coming in a medium cup. Weird. The killer was when tried an iced toddy and couldn't finish it. Surprisingly acidic. Again, I really want to like this place for all the good reasons, but....",

Fortunately I was not pressed for time so this wasn't a deal breaker for me on this particular day.  Strange that as soon as my order arrived, the number of staff went from two to four-things went much more smoothly after this. Maybe it was dead and two people went on break and five minutes later a crowd came in. Who knows and like I said, not a deal breaker. I enjoyed my Americano and the man who waited on me heated my brownie, which was a nice touch. The place reminds me of a cafe I used to hit when I was in Buenos Aires so it made me feel nostalgic. Just a touch of European flavor mixed in with great local products. Truth be told, I probably I like the atmosphere here more than what I consumed. I have to say that  the Espresso at Lux is THE BEST in The Valley and nothing, including Urban Beans, has come close. But as I've seen myself saying a lot lately, this is no reason not to check these guys out. In addition to coffee, they have pastries, smoothies, sandwiches and other cafe fare. I also like the wine bar which I may need to visit in the near future. One of their best features is the patio which will be a great place to enjoy a brew or a glass of vino. So I like the place and I will be back.",

Very chill, clean interior, and an overall welcoming atmosphere. Service was excellent, fast, and super friendly. We had the tacos: a bit small but very tasty, and a rice bowl that was also really good. Maybe a bit too much rice, but it was flavorful and perfectly cooked so I didn't really mind. We also got a smoothie that could have had a bit less ice blended in, giving it a slightly weak flavor. That being said, I am very picky and critical, and they definitely earned a solid 4 star rating. I'll definitely go back next time I'm in the area. You should check this place out.",

Even if everything had been average or terrible, the brunette girl that works the front is very nice and she was enthusiastic about everything. To the owner: she is awesome, make sure she sticks around.   I had been to urban beans a few times, but mostly for their eclectic wine selection (they have a bunch of good Washington state wines which are a little tough to find). Today was the first time I ate here. Iced tea and turkey and Brie sand which.... Well seasoned and came with an uber yummy side salad. I took the two top piece if bread off but that is just a personal preference.   I would like to add that this is the best time of year to use their outdoor seating (feb thru may). It is gorgeous out and even better when coupled with their excellent device and good food.",

However, there is this one girl that works there (blonde short hair, piercings) that is incredibly rude.

Then, I asked her about the pastries, and she's basically like \"Well, is that what the tag says? I can't see it?\" Ok the tag said just \"dairy\" and I found out those were their non-vegan selections... She turned it around and was lovely. The lack of a star is because I was expecting more food choices. The outside seating was nice and clean. I wasn't able to sleep and that place was somewhere to go and just write and think. If I was vegan, I would have probably stayed longer and had plenty of food choices. I have vegan friends who struggle so I see what it feels like.",

    "text": "It's open. Finally.  Yes, folks, my neighborhood at long last has its own bona fide coffee shop and not just a dubious Circle K.   Urban Beans, they call themselves. I believe when I told a friend the name, he called it \"jaunty\".  Take it for what you will.  Now obviously I haven't been sitting around caffeine deprived all this time as I've very much made myself at home at almost every coffeehouse in existence within a 10 mile radius (include the old CounterCulture Cafe on McDowell at 2 in the morning), but the fact that this one is 60 seconds away (instead of 240), is HUGE.  Ok, not really. But I could be a regular, if they play their cards right.  AND....? ----------- ATMOSPHERE: Fairly minimalist in setting. A bright open rectangular space with a lot of natural light; white walls adorned with modern art. All tables are two-tops and there are no couches. An outdoor patio overlooking 7th street that also has a few tables. Mellow downtempo music playing....  WI-FI? -------- Yes. Outlets, also yes.  FOOD? ---------- No cooked food prepared in store. Just pastries and quiche. Always the quiche, it appears. Pastries included bear claws, sugar cookies, and some humongazoid apple crumble death star thing...  DRINKS ------------ An array of your regular coffee beverages, along with a good selection of iced teas and blended coffee drinks/smoothies.   SERVICE ------------- A toss-up. I couldn't quite read them. Now, I was beyond stoked these guys were open. However, they were pretty much less than thrilled about my stoked-ness. I was firing all sorts of questions which I think to them just sounded obvious and rudimentary. Maybe they were tired? Who knows. Not the most inviting vibe, but I'll have to come back on a subsequent visit to be sure.   VERDICT ON THE PRODUCT? ------------------------------------------- My soy latte was done well, thank you.   And there you have it. Another CenPho coffeehouse. Ready for your perusal. And my caffeinated stopovers.  3.75 stars for now.",

I was happy to find that along with a gorgeous array of pastries ranging from vegan chocolate torte to chocolate pecan pie, there was also an assortment of breakfast and lunch items.  Not only does Urban Beans feature a Sunday Brunch with Omelet bar every Sunday, but there is a wonderful assortment of breakfast items to be enjoyed.   Farm egg sandwiches on toasted english muffins, Market quiche, granola parfait, scones, and even gluten free vegan english muffins.  Furthermore, lunch selections boast a fabulous spread of sandwiches such as the turkey, brie, cranberry sandwich with a fabulous mango cranberry chutney and fresh arugula.  For the salad selection I highly recommend the quinoa mediterranean salad with mini tomatoes, persian cucumbers, feta cheese, fresh mint, and their citrus house vinaigrette.  A more esoteric selection on the menu is the pear and arugula melt, with fresh pears, arugula, fontina cheese, and a balsamic raspberry reduction.  Average price of a sandwhich is about $8, salads and quiches range from $4.50-$7.50.  Melts are about $8-$9.    I have only sampled the Chai latte here, which I thought was beautifully rendered.  Coffee and espresso drinks are abundant here, prices are very reasonable.  Great lunch spot, perfect for browsing the internet with their free wi-fi on a lazy sunday.",

I think they've tried music venue/art gallery as well. They do none of these things with excellence. The coffee is fine, often bitter or weak. The staff can't be blamed, since they are not trained as baristas. Dont order dinner, i've tried several things and nothing is great but it's all more than $10. Honestly I come still from time to time because the place is so conveniently located and every time I go I regret it (I never seem to learn, I go three times a year and its been like 5 years). If you want to be a coffee shop be a really good coffee shop, if you want to be a bar be a really good bar, if you want to be a restaurant be a really good restaurant! Pick one, and focus and do it well!!",

It's like it's specifically designed to make you want to get comfortable and chill for a while. It's not a large space, but we found a booth and enjoyed our drinks and a shared square of cheesecake with lemon custard. I had a raspberry mocha, which was nicely bittersweet, and she finished her large coffee in record time. The coffee really helped cut the richness and sweetness of the cheesecake, which was a bit much for my taste.   The girl working the counter was super amiable, and offered suggestions when we were staring at the menu board in a stupor.  The thing I think could improve my visit are the bathrooms, which weren't messy, but need some TLC.",

I came and there was a line so I assumed it was going to be pretty good. It was a spacious and clean building, good seating area and they provide wifi.   I ordered to dine in and I got the #1 burrito which had potatoes, pinto beans, and chipotle sauce and I added spinach and mushrooms. Food got to me pretty quickly and it was so good that I make my own version of it at home now! The only downside was that they didn't have that many vegan dessert options, but what more can you really expect if you go to a vegetarian place?   Workers were friendly and helpful since it was my first time going there. Definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a chill place to enjoy breakfast in the downtown Phoenix area.",

We ordered two hot mochas and it was probably the worst coffee drink we have ever had. The guy working was obviously new. Okay, not a big deal normally, but this guy didn't know anything. I should have known it was going to be a disaster when he asked how much mocha syrup went into my drink.  In the end it tasted like watered down brewed coffee with no mocha flavoring at all. Where was this guy's training? Two mochas $11 and change. Very disappointing!  Also a bit annoyed that they do not offer decaf!   I like to support local, but I probably won't be back here. There is a great 24 hour coffee shop just up the street on Camelback.",

With the exception of the pastries, everything is now build-your-own.  In addition to a complete overhaul of their menu, they were completely out of a handful of ingredients they had listed on their new menu. I was so overwhelmed with their extensive list of ingredients and options, I ended up just getting coffee (which is always a winning decision here).  I most likely won't be eating here again. If I wanted to build my own breakfast, I would have just stayed at home. Restaurants and cafes are supposed to share and suggest what THEY'RE good at making, not what ingredients they have for me to choose from.  Sorry Urban Beans, as a coffee shop, you get 5/5, but as a cafe, I'm now giving you 1/5.",

I checked in my food to see when it'd arrive, and I wasn't treated to well. (I wish I cud have taken back my tip!) When my California wrap came out, it was in a white tortilla when I was told it was corn. What they did was take it back, dump oit half the filling and give me two cold tortillas with cold filling. So unappealing. Needless to say, I'm not impressed and I don't think I'll be back. Sad meal and a waste of my time and dollars.",

Look at my pictures for things to come. They've recently brought in a local chef, Nick. Surely, they spared no expense to get this guy to cook for them.   Some friends and I came in, all ordered different things from a list of recommendations by the guys beyond the counter.   The food was FANTASTIC! I'd have expected to pay double for meals like this. Lots of flavor, lots of color, and from such friendly folks.   I'll be coming in and eating a lot more often, needless to say.

All of these bode well for a full-time employee + grad student. On weeks when I have an exam, you can find me in here nearly every night.    They have a Sunday brunch, and always some tasty snacks (quiche, muffins, scones, cookies, etc.) and even breakfast items. Vegan options are available also.   There's a wine bar also!   I love the quirky furniture and artwork (which is for sale, by the way). I love giving my patronage to locally-owned businesses, and this is a really good one.",

They have a strong Wifi signal making it a great place to get work done.  It also has a great patio.  However, with street traffic sometimes the patio can get a little loud.   I've tried several menu items and keep going back to the Mediterranean Quinoa Salad.  Greens, tomatoes, cucumber and feta.  The homemade vinaigrette is light and refreshing with a subtle tartness that makes the salad a refreshing meal.  Urban Beans' espresso is rich and smooth. I've never had a burnt shot.  The iced coffee is light and smooth.  If you're like me and like your coffee a little sweet ask the barista to sweeten it as they make it.  The amount of simple syrup they add is perfect.    I really enjoy Urban Beans.  After passing it by for years, I finally went in and quickly became a regular.",

The quiche was premade and should have been served up within a relatively timeline basis. My friends omelette came before my quiche. The guy just yells omlette, not with the 3 toppings he asked for, like omlette with tomato, cheddar cheese, and soy chorizo. My friend got a plate with just the omelette, no potatoes like the menu specified. So he asked the guy and he said Oh I'm heating them up. We get the potatoes and they were cold.   I asked about my quiche and apparently they forgot I ordered it. He said he will get it and it will be out in about 5 minutes. He brings it out, and told me to be careful because it is hot. So I waited about a minute took a bite and it wasn't very hot, it was cold. I had my friend try it and he basically said it was never heated. So I took it back told him it was cold. So he took the plate  and I walked away .  He came out about 10 minutes later and served the same piece that I had taken a bite. Um yuck, sanitary?? Not to mention that it was dry and still  not hot. The coffee was not very hot  and it was weak . I could have got three coffees at QuikTrip  for the price I paid for just one and they would taste better and be hot. Also, it is 42 degrees outside why do you have the air conditioned blasting on customers, 3 people came up and asked if she could turn it off. She was clueless on how to do so.  I think the health department needs to make a little trip to this restaurant. Not once have I seen any of the employees wash their hands. The lady at the register takes money and serves food.",

The other lady gave me 2 options and after an awkward exchange asked how long I would be. Normally I get a \"it will be ready in 15-20 minutes\" when I call in orders but not here. I showed up and wanted to confirm one burrito was vegan since the new menu at the store only said eggs and cheese. The new girl had no idea and another lady with purple hair seemed too busy to care so just gave an annoyed thumbs up. I've been here before where other employees have no idea if coffee or other menu items are vegan, and have even seen one belittle a young female employee in front of the whole restaurant for about 15 minutes while I ate. Great food, spotty service, and never know what you will get.",

Service is always good and they're always willing to take their time to answer any questions that you may have for them.",

You order at counter and get your own water. Do you still tip 20%? Not sure but computer came up automatically 18 or 20 or other on screen. That was dirty also.   Went to bathroom to wash hands. The door has dirty blue tape on it but overall bathroom good. No print out of receipt. Waiting on food now.... Tofu scramble and jackfruit to come...  Ok scramble here and jackfruit came 4 min after. Not that big of a deal as this is not a 100% full service restaurant. Potatoes seem to be frozen ones - however, not bad as the price is right. Not for sure if they are frozen or not. The gal made adjustments with a smile and the cook got all correct. The scramble was a little salty. Overall good. Now the jackfruit tacos - I adjusted to corn tortilla instead of a torta. WOW. Outstanding!  Maybe best I've had. Let me say it again - Outstanding!  A little cleaning and lighten up on salt and this place is a 5 star. I will return. Wait....  I went to get the scone. The gal was very helpful on what was vegan even came around the bakers case. Scone was perfect.",

Breakfast burritos were solid, omelettes were solid, potatoes were filling, jackfruit delicious. I have had both really great, and less than average experiences here but the last time I came here I was super disappointed. I literally waited about 20 minutes for a breakfast sandwich, because Phoenix New Times was there, and therefore much more important than me (so I was told by the staff, the importance part being my own interpretation). Besides that fact, I was flabbergasted by what I was served. Between an english muffin was what must have been a single cold egg, topped with what looked like chopped/canned peppers, and a cold shredded cheese...For $8, and a 20 minute wait. I was too much in shock at the time to say anything. I was also still starving and had places to be so I scarfed it down and went to a drive through that at least had more than one egg on the sandwich. That plus this new menu stuff makes me hope Urban Beans works out whatever they're going through so that you can continue to be my go to spot, for food, coffee, and atmosphere",

I've gotten a free meal twice because of how terrible the employees are. The management has changed and so has the menu but they have the same terrible employees with nasty attitudes. One time I called in an order for two burritos and she was very rude to me on the phone and wouldn't even give me my total or a n estimated time. When I arrived they ended up only making one and the same employee that took my phone order gave me a lot of attitude for their mistake and tried to blame everything on a rush that was no longer there. So the manager had to comp my meal because of how bad the cashier's attitude was. He even had to send her to the back. The food is always dry now and they raised the prices and changed the menu and it is not great at all I can't find anything that I enjoy to eat there any more so I have stopped going there. This is a full year of service in one review from me. Just shitty!",

UB makes the best almond milk London Fogs in town. They are rich, and composed of quality ingredients.   Another reason I love UB, is because of the quality of their pastries. UB continually introduces new eccentric items to their menu are always delectable. They offer an array of gluten-free and vegan options.   Finally, the employees at UB are polite, and experienced. Simply put, they know what they are doing.   Lastly, my only critique of UB is that they revisit their WIFI set and seating arrangements. Trying to access their WIFI is the equivalent of breaking into Fort Knox, that is, not easy. Moreover, they just need more seats with a table. There are too many here for everyone to sit comfortably at a table, especially if you're with a group larger than 5.   Nonetheless, please come to UB, I promise you will not be disappointed and they will come through on all of your gluttonous desires.",

I used to come here every weekend, so I know my order really well. I usually get a small hot chai, and it was my favorite chai of all time. Since early July, the chai has not been the same, and when I order a latte, the foam take up 1/4 of the drink! When I pick it up it FEELS obviously light and when I take a sip, the layer of foam is unbelievably thick. This also applies to the chai, and the people who make it haven't been putting in as much cinnamon or any of the spices that usually go in it. I always come in around 11 PM - 2 AM, and usually on Saturday or Friday nights. I thought maybe the first time it was because there was a new employee, but it's been CONSISTENTLY like this ever since.  But the best thing about this place is the lemon lavender cake. I haven't had it in a while, but it's very flavorful and moist. I hope it hasn't changed",

I go to this place probably one to two times a week, a convenient location for me and stays open *24 hours.* I imagine it is that plus the young, granola vibe the place has to it that keeps its rating up. If you stop in here once or twice, the atmosphere and yummy vegan treats will probably keep you from seeing the major management issues that are evident to anyone who frequents or has frequented this place..  Every time (and I mean EVERY time) I go in here, there are new employee faces I've never seen before. Not only that, but last week's \"familiar\" faces are gone; I am very curious about the turnover rate here. Just as inconsistent as the employees, are the PRICES (I get the same order every time) ranging from $4 for both drinks, to $8 for both, to $10 or $11 sometimes.. it takes so long to get my drinks and order most of the time that I don't even bother to argue, plus I know it's only going to make things harder on the newbie of the day. The coffee tastes good usually, but I always have to make sure my espresso shot is added or that the drink is made right.   I feel bad saying this as most people working there are young and seem to really be trying; I know it's hard to learn anything when you are trained by someone who really still could use training..   Yet, this place is still very successful.  I've never eaten the cooked food, only the muffins or pastries, but the bakery items are usually delicious and healthy. The artsy feel of this place keeps people coming back in, especially the youngins. Like I said, I go back too, but would never go out of my way for this place and my boyfriend and I know it always takes at least 10 minutes to get our coffees here..",

I also forgot that in the morning, headed north on 7th street, one cannot turn left into the parking lot. So after, maneuvering around the area, I finally arrived. Parking was easy and convenient.  Once inside, I was helped promptly and the employees began on my cafe mocha, offering to add a shot of toasted marshmallow syrup. This was quite nice but regretfully, I couldn't taste any of the flavoring in my drink. I didn't realize this until I was several blocks away and my drink had cooled slightly. I also ordered a dark chocolate mocha scone, which was tasty but a tiny bit dry.  The interior is a bit messy behind the counter but the seating area is clean. I enjoy supporting local establishments but UB doesn't have a welcoming vibe like others in the area.  While not my favorite, I plan on returning here instead of the Bux next door.",

    "text": "To my knowledge, there is only one other 24-hour coffee house in the greater Phoenix area  (The Grand near ASU downtown), and in general only a handful of other coffee shops open past 8PM. So that right there gives them stars on stars.  As a student usually working after hours, I usually go with UB over the grand because  1. 24-hour breakfast burritos  2. more light = less drowzy  3. It doesn't turn into a poppin bar after 7:00 (though sometimes this is the main reason I would choose the Grand instead).     UB has an AMAZING vegan pastry/food/ice cream selection as well as a fun cocktail menu. The drinks are alright, but that is where the 4 stars/5 comes in for me. Example: I love a good date shake and I've ordered theirs three times with different results each time... but unfortunately all sub-par. Their iced teas are excellent however, and no complaints about any of the espresso drinks I've ever ordered, though sadly nothing to write home about.   The other reason I gave 4/5 stars concerns the staff. There's some fantastic people working here, but that hasn't been my experience across the board. Excellent customer service appears (to me) to be based more on person-to-person character than on company training. Most of the time I have no qualms, but on occasion there is an aloof or indifferent attitude on the other side of the counter. But, to their credit, if I was working at 2AM I probably wouldn't be all that excited either.   The primary UB assets that keep me coming back are location (proximity to Buffalo Exchange is a BIG plus ;) ), open 24hrs/7 days a week, a chill atmosphere (live music sometimes), the huge 24-hr vegan-friendly menu, and consistent wifi. Also, maybe a dumb thing to add, but I work in a coffee shop that doesn't have an in-house bathroom, and UB has two... so if you're on a study marathon, no fear- you're not away from your laptop for long.  Would definitely recommend giving them a try!",

First off, I waited exactly 3 minutes  and 23 seconds before I was acknowledged (and  yes, I timed it) For a place that seems pretty prideful in food options online, the 'cook' didn't seem terribly concerned or knowledgable in what was in the featured item of the day. (Jack fruit tacos) I asked what all went in it before I ordered she literally shrugged at me and looked up at the menu for clues. The girl who rang me up mentioned to her 'we you should know since you're gonna be making it if she orders it.'  Another disappointment, I wanted to order a raw juice, I asked if it was possible to get just carrot and ginger, she said 'they're premade cause if you've owned a juicer, you'd know they're a bitch to clean.' ...I'm okay, so you're not willing to make something I can have just because the equipment is a hassle for you to clean?  Moving on, since I couldn't have anything else, I opted for lemonade...tastes like watered down minute maid...the jackfruit tacos we're okay,...but left me hungry again an hour later...for $11.95...I'd hoped to be full a little longer..  Overall, for being 'vegan friendly' ...allergens don't seem to be a priority here...gluten free options seemed to be next to nothing which was a bit of a let down. Perhaps I had higher expectations from seeing such high reviews on this place, but I don't think I'll be returning to a place where the workers make you feel like you're an inconvenience to serve.",

I ordered a large vanilla latte with whole milk. No problem. It was served in a huge ceramic cup. Awesome. And it tasted great! Because I had heard (read on yelp) that the food here was excellent, we decided to order a scone. At three o'clock in the afternoon, the choices were slim and we had to settle for a blueberry muffin. This was very moist and the blueberries had great flavor. You can also buy a beer or a glass of wine here so everyone who comes here should be able to get what he/she wants. The art on the walls is a great experience enhancer.",

After securing a two person table (the tabletop had cool artwork on it) and sitting in a super comfortable chair, I looked into the depths of my Americano and decided that I'd like something from the pastry cabinet to complement the espresso or I'd be flying higher than a kite, which ended up being a blueberry muffin with a strong fresh blueberry flavor. I would have had a scone too but then dinner would never happen. By the way, the lunch menu here looked  awesome, but it was close to 3 p.m. and for me, that means afternoon coffee.  The inside space isn't huge, but the outside patio space is. In fact, just outside my window a man sat eating an awesome looking salad.   I absolutely loved the wall art and the funky tables, but the coffee and the food will have me coming back here every time I'm in the area. Urban Beans, you have my loyalty.",

There's ample amounts of space to sit inside and a patio facing 7th street that's great for lounging.  Ordered a Chai Latte and tried Anthony L.'s Latte- the pours are generous! Don't let the lack of latte art fool you, their coffee is bold and True. I enjoyed my Chai, it wasn't watered down like how it is at Lux and had a good amount of spice that wasn't too light nor spicy- sorry extra spicy Chai lovers. It tasted like Christmas and felt like a hug from the inside out.  Definitely a great spot!",

I live in the neighborhood and visit UB at least one a week. Based on the taste alone, I would never know if I was at the same coffee shop. One example is the hot Mocha. At best, it doesn't taste like chocolate at all; at worst it's like drinking cardboard dissolved in water. Please UB management, test out a new mocha espresso recipe.",

First off, I looked up their menu online and thought it would be a nice place to take my girlfriend. Upon arrival, we learned that they had changed their menu and taken off almost everything we had picked out online. We found a couple things that could work for us, so when we were ready to order, they told us they were out.   This brings me to my next point. They were out of almost everything on their new menu. How does a business change their menu, and then not stock up for those few select items? (They were even out of to-go boxes!)   I ended up getting some sort of smoothie that tasted like barely flavored water. My girlfriend got an Italian soda, which she seemed to enjoy, but it was just ok IMO. She wanted a parfait - strawberries and curdled milk she got! I got a side of avocado and a side of eggs, which were actually palatable, but not for the price.   I would give this place one star, but the ladies working remained professional and polite despite our hangry disbelief.   Getittogether Urban Beans!!",

I smiled, put a little sugar in my tea, and was on my way, but not before ANOTHER handsome stranger held the door open for me and said he hoped I would have \"a lovely day.\"  So I clicked my heels, sipped my tea, and went off into the sunset.",

My only complaint is the service, and it's only one barista in particular.  We get great service from everyone else.  Much like one of the reviewers below, we have had this barista just stare at us when come up to the counter with a strange look on her face, and she says nothing.  I decided to just start ordering when the strange look turned into a nasty looking smirk.  I've asked her about some of the food on previous visits, if she had eaten it, and she made another strange face and said, \"Uh, no.\"  This barista really creates a terrible vibe for our visits, and seems very unfriendly and rude.    We LOVE the place, for every other reason, but next work-session, we are going to try somewhere else.  I'm sure we will be back in though - UB is just too good in all other areas.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that this place is EXPENSIVE! It makes Starbucks look cheap compared to their prices. I got a SMALL iced coffee for almost $5. Even Starbucks is cheaper! The coffee was just an average ice coffee flavor like the one you can get at McDonalds for $1.49 (medium size) but they are a rip off! Plus they have horrible customer service. When I was in line there was one person in front of me and it was not busy at all, but they took forever taking his order and there was two people helping him and they weren't even helping him they kept on laughing and talking about random stuff, as if they were friends, which I truly don't care but it was an inconvenience because I had to wait 5-10 minutes for just 1 person in front of me. They didn't even greet me say \"hello, good morning, we will be with you in a minute\" NOTHING! They both saw me and I had my wallet in my hand and staring at both of the workers who were just chatting with the person in front of me who was most likely a friend. (I could tell by there conversation.) to indicate that I am ready to order, but nope I waited 5-10 minutes just for them both to acknowledge me and say \"what can I get for you?\" Not even a \"sorry for the wait\". Also it was my first time going in so I asked what she recommends and she said \"everything's good\" ok... Um thanks for your recommendation.. NOT. I then asked her what kind of iced coffee they have and she answered with a rude/ angry \"all that you can think of\" Just no help at all. There menu is not even readable and it's just crazy that they even have semi-decent reviews on Yelp because they do NOT deserve it. Plus the tables were dirty and they had no clients! I was NOT impressed at all. Save your money!! & Pass this place it really is nothing special. I will NEVER return and will make sure my friends and family don't ever stop at this place.",

Saw some reviews of paying a high price for the iced coffee, but they must have purchased the 32 ounces because my 16 oz was just about $3, less than the franchise across the street. Glad to know how close this place is to work. Too bad we didn't have more local coffee houses out in north Peoria like this. Great place. Hats off to the owners",

Urban Beans has the perfect environment of independent coffee shop meets a clean and modern space with an eclectic touch. There's plenty of seating inside and out and they even have comfy chairs at the tables. Free Wii Fi and electrical outlets make this the perfect work space and the food and drink options make it the ideal one.   The iced coffee here is delicious and I was happy to learn that they have sugar free chocolate syrup which is far and few between! It is pricey though and was $5.04 for a large iced coffee. I would definitely be in trouble if I worked here too long and too much! But the coffee is good and the environment is even better so I will most definitely be back.",

Tonight we went and found the menu had changed...there were just a list of ingredients and a couple of coffee choices with a list of flavors syrups. It was painful to look at and we decided to just get the frozen vanilla coffee drink we have gotten before. After asking us if it was like a frappacino, the person behind the counter said she could try to make how to make it. We asked where the chessboard was ( we have played chess for hours there before), she told us it was outside. We found it in a heap thrown in a table, it was so dirty that it looked as if it had been sitting in a dump for months...and on of the pieces was missing. They were also playing rap music, dropping the n-bomb every other sentence...not a fit for anyone there. She came out with two drinks instead of one and told us she accidentally made more. They were downright awful, like black coffee ground with ice. We brought the drinks up and I told her that they were really poor, not sweet at all like before. She then exclaimed that she used too much ice, and she would make them over using more vanilla \"pops\". She had us taste them again and they were frothy and now tasted like nothing. We asked her when they changed the menu, she told us three days ago?!? She then proclaimed that we probably wanted a \"vanilla smash, she also informed us that it used powder the make  it  sweeter... We left after we paid for the drink.... Doubtful on a return",

    "text": "I was able to visit this hipsterish wifi cafe on two separate occasions after reading so much about it on Yelp. The horizontal interior has good natural lighting, a front pastry counter, arrangement of tables and high chairs to the left, and a wine bar to the right. Noise level is high, and the clientele includes laptop dwellers, students, and group gatherings.  Kale and Roasted Beets Salad ($9): A good serving of fresh kale, walnuts, goat cheese, roasted beets and red pepper vinaigrette. The composition was tasty, as the mix of creamy goat cheese, crunchy walnuts, fresh beets, and firm beets were delightful. I had this salad on both visits. Quality can be inconsistent between visits, as the kale was slightly yellow on the first try and overdressed and saltier yesterday. I'm likely to try the Quinoa Salad before coming back to order this dish again.  Pear and Arugula Melt ($9): Flat bread layered with fresh pears, arugula, fontina cheese, and dressed with balsamic raspberry reduction. This item is no longer available on the menu, but the inconsistent firm and softness in the flat bread struggled, and the sour balsamic raspberry reduction didn't mix well with the pear. The cafe will jumpstart a new menu soon, so hopefully the flatbread will be much improved if it's scheduled for a return.  Soy Dirty Chai Latte ($6.34): The latte was sweet with a solid hint of strong espresso and noticeable chai. The price was steep because they penalize diners for the use of soy--even though there is not a whole lot of differentiation to the cost of milk in the supermarket. This was one of the better dirty chai lattes, but also not worth the price.  Green Peach Ice Tea ($2.50): The ice tea was light and refreshing. The mix of green tea and subtle peach flavor was nicely balanced.   Service was personable but a bit snooty. They were very nice to let me sample the Garbanzo Soup and my drinks came out quickly. However, the password for their wifi was \"thankyou\" and my colleague and I were both offended by it. Overall, it was a pricy but convenient place for laptop users and group gatherings.  I'd be interested in coming back to see if their new menu will be any better.",

The coffee and the rest of the drinks and treats are all Average at best. But do I have anything bad to say about this place? Absolutely not! I finally got to try this place that I heard so much about over Christmas vacation this last year 2016. The area is quiet but not bad and pretty close to the skyline. It's a privately owned place but the coolest thing is that it's one of the only coffee places around that is open 24 hours and it's also open during major holidays.  This is the reason why I went to go check it out in the first place because it was one of the only places open it on Christmas. I enjoyed being with family and friends but I do like to run around town and look for my adventures. This is what I hate about the holidays because everything seems to be closed. I totally understand that you're supposed to be sticking around the house with your family but my family goes to bed fairly early and I like to stay up pretty late especially around the holidays so this is a perfect place to go check things out with all your adventurous Friends and family members like to stay out late.  I wouldn't say it's the quiet type environment but it is subtle enough to do some homework if you need to get that done but also a good date place if you want to get to know somebody but I also like that you can bring small group in here and hang out and just enjoy yourself for as long as you want since it's open all day all night. Bottom line I highly recommend this place because of the hours alone and the service is superb as well. It's a very friendly environment with a neighborhood atmosphere and very artsy as well.",

The sweet female barista made me a \"surprise\" latte when I couldn't decide, and it was delicious! However, after waiting over ten minutes for my quiche to warm up, I approached the gentleman behind the counter. With a massive attitude, he told me it's \"not coming up because I don't see any tickets behind here a quiche on it. Go talk to her.\"  Oh, I'm sorry. Did my being a customer interfere with your ability to do your job?  I'm just sorry I left a 15% tip before all this happened.   Want a decent latte? Feel free to go to Urban Beans.

I fell in love with the Joyous Almond which is a mix of their toddy iced coffee, mocha, coconuts, and almonds - bits of coconuts and almonds come in your drink, and a regular is about the size of a Venti at Starbucks, with much more taste and not at all the over priced tag to it.  The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable, (at least the ones that come between 9-12). They'll give you tastes of the beers and recommendations, and hook you up if they're out of something with the coffee drinks. There's lots of seating, and this sounds so small, but the fact that all their chairs have comfy cushions on the backs, is amazing. When you sit for long periods of time working, this makes a huge difference for back problems. As for the clientele, I've seen a mixture of students, healthcare workers, gay guys, and old timers.

Nathaniel and Amanda can pretty much anticipate my order now that I've become a regular and always greet me with a smile. They obviously are passionate about what they do and that's refreshing!  Some mornings can be a little crazy: professionals with laptops and cell phones abuzz. If that's not your speed, wait till around 9am or try another day. I often see students studying here as well. :)",

But alas, no chocolate in the case. We settled on the lemon lavender cake (which I'm sure was yummy) and ordered a couple of lattes, but happened to ask the guy behind the counter if by some chance they might have anything chocolate in the back. He disappeared for a few minutes, and a lovely woman came out and said she'd heard we wanted some chocolate and said, \"We take our chocolate very seriously here.\" -- then told us she was going to make us a special treat and asked whether we preferred light or dark chocolate (definitely dark). Wow. Impressive.  About 15 minutes later, she came out with a beautiful tart made with shortbread crust and a dark chocolate ganache filling, topped with pecans and caramel sauce. Gorgeous presentation, and the taste was beyond heaven -- literally the best dessert I've ever had. The still-warm ganache was deep, dark, soul-satisfying CHOCOLATE. Oh Lordy, we were in hog heaven. We polished that baby off, finished our lattes, and made a speedy and contented trip back to Tucson.   Thanks to the warm and thoughtful folks who work there--you're there best (and your baker is amazing)! I'll be back!",

My sister and I ordered a caramel toffee nut mocha, iced green tea/lemonade combo, and a slice of quiche.    Neither of us particularly loved our drinks... they weren't bad, but they weren't anything that we would ever crave.  And, considering that we both constantly crave the green tea/lemonade at Luci's, it just didn't seem like it was worth going out of the way to return here.  On the plus side, the quiche was fantastic.  Light, fluffy egg/ham filling on tender crust.  Lovely for a morning snack.  While I liked the eclectic, mis-matched chair thing they have going on, I felt like the interior was lacking something.  Displays weren't as visually attractive as I would expect, and the vibe was kind of boring.  Ah, well... back to Luci's!",

This is the kind of place for non-amplified music, but luckily the person took a break about two minutes after we had ordered our food to go.    When we arrived home we found that they had forgotten two of our salads, but everything we had ordered had been prepared well.  Not sure if Ill go back, but it was worth the discounted price.",

The iced coffee is really nice too. It is really smooth and not too bitter.",

I didn't make it in during the holidays, but I finally did yesterday.  The place is really spacious, bright, and inviting.  There are plenty of tables and chairs and it looks like a great place to study, read, or  hang out with a friend or two.  I ordered a cafe au lait to go.  The nice guy at the counter asked me what ratio of coffee-to-milk I wanted and what kind of milk I wanted.  While the traditional cafe au lait is equal parts coffee and steamed whole milk, I don't always want lots of coffee flavor, so I found it thoughtful that he asked.  The display case had lots of different goodies, and had I not just purchased some delectable creme brulee from Torched Goodness, I would have chosen a treat.  I have been told they also serve sandwiches and have some of the best hummus/veggie plates.  I'm really looking forward to trying that!  My heart still belongs to my old coffee shop, but I think I'm going to really enjoy stopping in at Urban Beans.  Hooray!",

In addition to a la carte items, UB offers a great multi-course breakfast, with your choice of side, main dish (including custom omelet), coffee and adult beverage (choice of mimosa or bloody mary). I don't remember the exact price but it's around $15 and worth every penny. And, if I'm going to have to be a coffee shop working on Sunday, it's awesome to be able to get a real breakfast and not just a pastry. Highly recommended :)",

I still stop in from time to time because it's the only place I'm aware of near me that makes gluten free vegan scones. Their coffee is crap, so I don't even bother with that anymore.  Last week, the girl who grabbed my scone used the tongs she had just used on the regular pastries. You may think \"No big deal\", but it is to me because I am allergic to wheat.   I said nothing and have the scone to my boyfriend. Today, I went for a scone and decided to try an iced dirty chai again too. First, the chai is not chai....they use Monin chai flavored syrup. Needless to say, it sucked.  Then, the kid making my latte WIPED SNOT FROM HIS NOSE TO HIS FOREHEAD WITH AN OPEN PALM and continued on making my latte!!!!! No washing hands, excusing himself to blow his nose, nothing. He could've at least used his sleeve??!! While this was going down, the girl frosting a cake behind the counter told me she licks the icing off of her fingers when she bumps the cake.  I asked her to grab my scone because snot wiper forgot. He threw on his hoodie and walked out the door.   I guess it was the lesser of two evils, her grabbing it rather than him.  I forgot to mention that there were balled up, dirty napkins on the table where the coffee lids and straws were.  I was so disgusted by the whole transaction that I couldn't even eat the scone. Not giving my money to this dump again.",

Now, they are market style so not much food choices later in the day and nothing like the food they had before. The place isn't very clean. Most of the staff seems to be standing around not doing anything most of the time.   It's really disappointing to see such a great place go down.",

My friends spoke highly of this place and I didn't see any reason why I should give it a whirl.   I ordered their Iced Horchata with two shots of espresso. Now, growing up I wasn't a fan of horchata, prior to my visit here, I wasn't sure where I stood with it still. I am here to declare that I've developed a liking.   The horchata is made in house, how would I know? I tasted the rice that had gathered at the bottom of my cup. It was delicious and it gave great texture to my drink. The cinnamon and seasoning were just right and not overwhelming. As an added bonus, frozen mango cubes were sprinkled on top! On a very hot Arizona day, chewing on a frozen fruit helps!   They displace their pastries and food in a well kept case. And their condiment bar is very organized. The decor is eclectic. It has an organized, home feel to it. The tables and chairs are miss-match but it works. There is a table with a chess set which I always find awesome! They have a restroom that is co-ed. Their patio area is cute and has plenty of shade! The entire place looks neat and clean!  Parking wasn't an issue and there seemed to be plenty!   The staff is very helpful and friendly. They answered all the questions that were asked and they even helped my friend decide on a drink.   I am definitely visiting again!",

If you want to get on your tablet or you mobile phone; either work or chat. Urban Bean is great for both. Outdoor seating as well. Also they bake all their bakery items in house. With a good selection of vegan items too. Not only that;  they also offer food, sandwhiches, plates soups, stews and from my recollection alwdays some thing for vegans.

In fact, it was calm, mostly quiet, relaxing, friendly, and most of all inviting, which is kind of the exact opposite of a hipster coffee shop (I still love you Lux don't worry). It was a bright and airy late morning, with a jubilant gentleman playing acoustic guitar.   I ordered a cold brew, which was delicious. Their pastries are good, too. The vegan brownie was light and tasty, and my friend totally loved her scone. We'll be back to try some more of the fuller breakfasts.   Apparently, they've got some craft draughts in the afternoon, so I can see this as a place to have a quick pint on a warm afternoon. It's a bit small, but with great atmosphere, kind staff, and good products, so I'll certainly return!",

She beat me there, was halfway through a cinnamon oat scone, rice krispy treat and a coffee, and was so pleased with everything that she proclaimed all meetings will henceforth be at local coffee shops. That's a big deal for her to abandon Cinnabon!  So - Urban Beans is a cute little coffee shop. Ample seating inside, cute art on the walls that's for sale, and a really nice little patio outside.   I had a soy white mocha and a java chip scone, and it was only $7.50  That would run $10 at the big green mermaid!  Both were really really good.   They aren't doing made-to-order food anymore, which is what I think most bad reviews are about. The pastries are all freshly baked though.  Only thing that could be better is put some music on or something. It was deathly quiet and I felt like everyone else was listening to our conversation. We moved outside because of that.",

They have free wifi, decent prices, exceptionally spacious seating (inside and out), and best of all, they're open 24/7.   Unfortunately, I am unsure if I had caught them on a bad night or not but my experience here was not up to my standards, even with all the great perks. I ordered multiple items and they were out of the non baked items I wanted. I then jumped to order baked goods and their oven was down. So then, my sister and I settled on some drinks.My sister and I wanted a lattes, and seeing a picture of a latte on the counter, we pointed. The gal responded with \"it won't look like that by the way\" talking about the free poured milk, way to kill the vibe lol. I got a raspberry Italian soda taking the recommendation from the barista,  and my sister ended with an iced chai tea latte. The drinks weren't bad, nor were they superb, so I wouldn't go out of my way getting them. We really wanted something to munch on so she recommended the hummus plate with pita and our total came out to be about $15. Also, as we were waiting on our order, we continuously heard them telling other customers that they were out of ingredients.   The hummus plate came out with really chunky and really cold hummus and stale room temperature pita bread that wasn't warmed all the way, on a bed of spinach.   I wish the perks of this place could bypass all the negatives for me, but I really think one visit it good enough for me.",

They graciously allowed us to keep our dog inside despite the open patio, and let us camp out at the bar for ~5 hours.   The chai latte is probably the best I have had anywhere, but their smashes are lacking in flavor, though the combinations are imaginitive. I was happy to discover their gluten free scone, but found it somewhat bland as well, though the fruit baked in was very good. The java chip scone was pretty good, as well, and neither were dry like scones usually are. We also got the kale beet salad, which bordered on scrumptious: the beets were cooked perfectly, and the rest mixed well. I think it was worth the twn dollars. No doubt, this place is quite expensive. The regular brew was ok - tasted a little burned, but tolerable.   The music selection was great (wish I had asked what pandora station it was...), and wasn't too loud. It's a comfortable little place and the service is very good. We enjoyed our afternoon here!",

I also like the relaxed atmosphere and artsy vibe. You order at the counter, and find a seat. I sat on the patio, as it was a sunny and balmy 68 . The machiatto coffee was really good with coconut milk . I ordered the Roasted Veggie wrap which comes out warm and with the tortilla grilled on the outside. When the plate was first put in front of me, I was a little surprised that it didn't come with a small side of hummus or salsa that typically accompanies wraps, and also missing was any side at all. No chips, grapes, fries, not even a pickle spear. Nothing at all. So it was a wrap on a big empty plate. I did ask for something for a sauce, and they were accommodating, and brought me some balsamic vinaigrette, and some vegan cheese they call Pleezsh. I will give them the wrap is delicious! The Pleezsh actually was the icing in the cake. It enhanced everything so much more. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area. However, I do think it is a bit spendy especially considering that there are no sides, and think that should be considered on their wrap or sandwich plates in the future. But, overall nice vibes, friendly staff, and great food!",

Also, they put in the right number of shots on the big drinks to keep from diluting the espresso.   Yesterday, I had the Delux breakfast sandwich. It's such a good little sandwich with a nice aioli and some arugula. It's definitely worth trying if you have been sticking to the basic sandwich.",

Maybe I can't give UB a fair review because I ordering a drink I've never had before, and it just wasn't for me. I got a latte with almond milk; I like almond milk on its own, so I figured it would be ok! No. Did not like it with almond milk at all and I didn't ask for a new drink because I had to get to work. A few more comments: the raspberry scone was dry, unfortunately, and the whole place is just busy with all the different chairs. I did love, however, the local and unique art on the walls, service was very friendly, and the space was bright. I will return, but this time get real milk! :)",

Anyhow, today I am trying the french toast (see picture).  They serve you home-made bread, 2 large slices and it is not overly sweet.  They also belong to the Belly Bites reward program -- nice touch.  The atmosphere is good to work in while enjoying a nice cup of coffee, latte, etc.  Good music too -- now playing \"Sweet Jane\" by Lou Reed -  RIP.  Oh, most importantly I forgot to mention the blazing fast internet they have here!",

Although I love Luxe also, their scones are nowhere near as moist as Urban Beans!!! All that being said, I tried a gluten free scone last week and it was awful. It literally tasted like cardboard- at least how I imagine cardboard would taste!!  Unfortunately, on the same visit the order taker wasn't paying close attention to my order and so I got a latte that was wasaayyyy sweeter than I like. I hope Urban Beans reads these reviews because their order takers (at the counter) could use some improvement- friendliness and details.  All that is very minor when considered with the whole picture. And I would whole heartedly recommend this place to my fellow picky espresso drinkers out there!",

The barista told me they didn't have nonfat milk, but had rice milk, soy milk, and almond milk. Thinking I misunderstood her, I asked \"You don't have any milk?\" to which she said they had whole milk. How does a coffee house not have a few types of cow's milk? Do that many patrons get rice milk in their coffee drinks? Ick. I guess I'm just not hip enough. Urban Beans usually makes a pretty good coffee and their bakery items are good. But it is starting to look a little dingy and dirty and seriously, a coffee house shouldn't run out of milk.  Update:  I visited again in March of 2018 to give Urban Beans another try.  This visit the barista informed me they were \"plant based\" and do not serve cow's milk.  (They didn't used to be.)  So, unless you are vegan, lactose intolerant or for some other reason don't drink cow's milk, you might want to visit Starbucks across the street.",

Also ordered a regular coffee and a hot chocolate.  The gal asked me 2x if I wanted whipped cream and both times I said yes but it arrived with no whip and barely warm. Husbands coffee was pumped out of a pot and only warm.  The name is Urban Beans right?.   Sandwiches arrived long after the coffee and cocoa were gone.  The English muffins were not toasted and sandwiches were just bland.  I would understand f the place was packed but it wasn't.  Overall it was messy (crumbs on tables,  outside not swept....) We try to support local biz but next time we will choose another place to spend $23.  I gave it a 3 because it is a cute place, the baked goods looked awesome.

Then I also got the apple tart pie, which was excellent! I love deserts and you can tell they used fresh ingredients. I would recommend this place to most people especially if you like to remain on the healthy side when eating out, but also have a sweet tooth. Like myself.

    "text": "Good lord.  I don't ask for much.  I ordered a slice of quiche and an iced coffee.  They didn't have to bake the quiche, just warm it up.  I waited 15 minutes and then went to the counter to ask for it.  The server looked confused and the Guy who took my order said he \"got lost.\"  I heard the server apologize to at least three tables (but not to me).  She told one guy the toaster burned his cinnamon raisin bagel (the last one in the shop) and insisted repeatedly that SHE didn't burn it--it was the toaster's fault.  Quiche was tasty, though.  The server said it was mushroom and spinach, so I had to wonder for a minute what the bright red things in my quiche were...then, I figured out it was mushroom and chard.  Coffee was \"eh.\"  The floor looked dirty.  There was a paper towel in the toilet.  Ok, I'm nit-picking now.  The place was moderately busy; the small private parking lot was full.  Fortunately, I was on my scooter, so I could squeeze into a non-parking space easily.",

There was plenty of parking, and I came out of Urban Beans happier than going in.  I walked into a nice open, bright, inviting environment.  One table had a meeting going on; another had web browsing; and another had one person moleskine writing.  I walked in, and the two baristas were so non-pressure, friendly, and nice.  They recommended their version of the frappe, and it was so worth the $5.  Do NOT skip the whipped cream.  That is the best part.  I rarely order dairy drinks or whipped cream, but this whipped cream was so fresh and light and almondy.  So good!  I loved sitting down and seeing the whites and wood-tones and little oil candles and fresh flowers at each table.  I am not sure how busy this place is in the morning or early afternoon or weekends, but my experience was A-plus!  I want to move next door to Urban Beans!",

The staff was very friendly, especially one girl who had great enthusiasm (or at least more than me :P) I ordered the Dark Chocolate \"Smash\" (what a fun name for their blended frozen coffee drinks!) While I waited, I was taken by all of the fabulous looking pastries and cookies in the display as well as the great, open interior. I was extreemly impressed with what was said to the owner's art along the walls. Anyways, back to the coffee drink... IT WAS ABSOLUTELY TO-DIE-FOR! After I got my drink my friend and I took advantage of the great patio and the cool (finally!) night. The only thing I could poke at, was that it took longer than I thought it would to get my drink, but I do realize that they are brand-new. What a great new spot! Oh, and P.S. -- I was surprised to learn that their cups made from corn biodegrate within 45 days! Now that's impressive!",

Check this spot out if you're in the mood for an iced mocha, and soon enough we all will be ready for sinfully delicious iced coffee drinks once things heat up.  They're baked good and bagels are supplied through Simply Bread, so they're solidly yummy as well.   I feel like they could improve the place with respect to making it cozier, it has sort of an awkwardness to the space planning (some Persian rugs maybe?), but it's still a sweet little biz that we all should try and support.  Wi-Fi, sunshine, and quietness also make it a great spot to work or meet a client for a casual meeting.",

First our waitress didn't give us any happy hour price on our wine and then we find out that it's $5.00 on 'certain' glass' and $1.00 off the others.  I tried to use my Belly points, but they amounted to a big FAT ZERO.   No one even thought of giving us what we were told, so I guess with all the fantastic happy hours out there, I won't be back.

    "text": "I first heard about this place via a tweet from @CenPhoTV, and since Urban Beans is located in my neighborhood, I decided to check them out.  I like the interior. It is minimalist, large, and well lit. I spoke with whom I believe to be the owner (I didn't think to ask, but she was very friendly) while my iced Americano was made. She informed me they will be open until 10pm (except Sunday's) and have plans to host live music events and small workshops on sustainability. Having another neighborhood coffee joint with late hours is always a plus, and given the size of the interior I could easily see live music nights working there. The place definitely has potential.  Now the reason for the three star review was the coffee. No new business, regardless of whether the owners have previous management experience, will ever rate higher than a three-star. As all things in life, lessons are learned through experience. Now the coffee wasn't bad, but it wasn't any better than say a Starbucks. This isn't a negative, only that with more experience I think the barista will pull a better shot and adjust their roast. Prices looked to be pretty reasonable. Food items are limited to pastries and muffins at the time, but I was told they have plans to bring in more confections and possibly even sandwiches.  The outside patio was shaded and nice, but depending on the time of day, the road traffic on 7th Street might be a little too loud to enjoy a conversation. There appeared to be plenty of parking, both in the lot and on the side street.",

While the location is a little out of the way, Urban Beans is a decent coffee shop with lots of space, free wi-fi, and decent coffee. It's not the best in town, but it gets the job done. They've got a decent selection of pastries and light lunch foods, and also serve smoothies and other icy treats, which are definitely welcome during hot Arizona summers. The people are nice, but not all of them are very keen on the coffee stuff. They're also right next to Bards Books, which makes for a good one-stop shop for a nice afternoon with yourself. Prices are okay, hours aren't too late. Reason why this place scores better with me than Lola Coffee: they don't burn their coffee. Automatic win.",

    "text": "I stopped in here for a coffee date with a girlfriend to catch up on gossip. Neither of us had been here before but UB is located on 7th street/thomas so it was a good location for both of us. She got a nonfat latte, I got a cappuccino. I chose the larger size for something like .50 more. Holy huge mug. I'm not kidding- I could not fit my 2 hands around this mother. It had 4 shots of espresso and was more than impressive. I think it cost me $4.00 total. The coffee was good, but I preferred Lux & Lola back in the day for coffee. Anyway, my friend and I split some sort of chocolate hazelnut torte dessert. It was dry and poor tasting. The fresh raspberry sauce on the top gave it some redemption, but it was not worth the calories or money. Overall, our bill was $13.00 which was a little pricey for the quality & lack of freshness of the torte. The atmosphere was quite nice, however. Coming for the atmosphere alone would be worth it. I suspect the other desserts in the case were  better than the one I got based on other reviewers feedback. They also have a cute, cozy patio right out front with strings of lights, plants and nice seating. In nice weather, it would be a great hangout spot. I'll return and try a different treat next time. I enjoy supporting local business and this place is a cute keeper.   Worthy to note- I also saw the workers there writing some sort of Happy Hour menu up on their big white board- something like 4-7 Monday thru Friday....? I have no idea what was on there but this place would be a great HH place to unwind with a few co-workers if you aren't into the bar scene.   Other thing to note- park in the lot SOUTH of the bldg, it is much larger and easier to get into/out of. The lot north of the bldg is crowded with spaces packed in like sardines. Good place to get your car dented/scratched.",

    "text": "So I heard about this place thru an acquaintance. She said she knew the owner, so I thought I'd give it a whirl. I just switched jobs, so it conveniently put me across the street from this place on 7th St just north of Osborn. At first I wasn't sure where it was, but the sign that you'll probably see best,  is their Urban Beans sidewalk sign and the other one is hidden behind trees for the most part (its actually their quaint patio with trees in the front that blocks the building. Anyway, I was eager to enter, so off I went. I found parking in the medium-sized parking lot, walked up to find the patio (as mentioned above) and entered the coffee house. It had the same feel as those you might find on Roosevelt. Really artsy and laid back. It has artwork that changes out once a month I believe and...FREE WIFI... yay! And please note, this place offers gluten-free products. I know that is important to a lot of people. So that's a bonus! Also the staff is very friendly and warm. Its so rare to get good customer service nowadays so I really boast about it when cust. service is good. They were eager to help me figure out what I'd like to drink and eat. The guy behind the counter went over the specials and everything. I ordered the turkey with brie. DELISH!  The turkey and brie (good sized portion by the way) had a very nice soft bread and cranberry aioli, brie cheese, with arugula. It also came with a side arugula salad. Very yummy. And I'm pretty sure those were homemade croutons in there too, but not sure though. Now about the coffee. I got one of the many monthly specials decaf / non-fat 'Gingerbread latte'.  Even though I love coffee, I rarely drink it b/c I don't drink caffeinated beverages any longer, but a decaf cup carries little caffeine so I indulge a few times a year. So this drink is way better than the gingerbread latte at Starbucks. (Dare I utter the words Starbucks in this place, they would prob. kick me out..lol) It was bold, creamy and very flavorful. I really enjoyed it. In fact, a few days later, I got another one!!   Go ahead and try this place, I have already recommended it to a fellow co-worker, and he too, loved this place and is going to go back again.",

As we started to order, the order-taker must have been new because she had to consult the barista on every item she entered/ordered. The shop was missing items from cups to syrups (no white chocolate mocha) and hardly had any assortments of food. To top it off, the bathrooms were completely disgusting--not clean and no hot water for hand washing--ewww.  This shop has the potential for being outstanding because the decor is nice & customers like to support small business coffee shops instead of major chains. This shop needs to hire the right people and pay them to make a difference. Being located right next to a Starbucks, this shop should not give customers a reason not to come back. Remember, for every 1 person who complains, statistically there are 26 who go away and never come back.",

The mocha almond smash and green tea smash are summer favorites for me. The large latte comes with four shots of espresso at a great price for under 5 bucks. They do this movie night one Monday of the month though I can't recal which right now.   All in alljust a great little coffee spot. Try it, you might like it!",

I pulled up to the place and it was well lit and inviting. I walk in and there are 2 employees inside who greeted me. I went to the counter to order my coffee and the lady was very nice. She asked what my name was and I gave it to her. She introduced herself as Amanda and asked if I had ever been there. I said it was my first time and they both thanked me for coming to check them out. I let them know that I probably would only be in about once a month because thats how often my job requires me to work in the middle of the night.   They said they had only been open 24 hours for about a week. I guess its lucky since I was desperate for my fix. My coffee was ready and they hooked me up with a cookie for ciming in to check them out so I thought that was pretty cool. The coffee was pretty good and Im wide awake now as I write this review! All in all it was great personable service (which unfortunately is somewhat rare these days) so I would recommend this place for all your caffeine and baked treat needs!   Oh also they didnt have stir sticks. They had regular tea spoons to stir my coffee as they were trying to be as green as they could so I respected that.   Give UB a chance!",

However, the customer service that was received was not top notch. My friend got her drink right away, mine ended up being forgotten and I waited about 20 minutes for it.

The art is good, the place is a good size and not too overwhelming in sound or furniture, and the folks are nice. Even a nice outside porch for sitting, but that can get a little loud because of the street. I just like plain coffee, and its hot and strong.   I'm a big iced tea person, and they have great ice tea. The tea isn't too sweet, the large is actually large, and the value is definitely there. Plenty of parking too. I'll keep going.",

I think it could have been good,  but the bottom of it was hard as a rock. Thank goodness it came with a sauce, that made a world of difference. Also, not having been here before I sat down thinking that our food would be brought to our table. Well 20 min later, with an almost empty restaurant, we had to go check on our food.   I did not post a review that time and decided I'd go back and try their coffee since I consider myself quite the coffee snob. I always judge a place by their ability to make a latte, and although I have had better lattes, I still am giving this place 3 stars. Which is generous considering how I really feel. But young lady behind the counter was chipper and talkative for it being so early in the morning, so three stars they get. Also, I understand that they are open 24 hrs. So if I ever find myself roaming around in the middle of the night needing espresso (or a beer) I'll stop by again.",

I can't even describe how one of the women tried to get the bottom of the brew into my cup and then when not full, starting taking drips from a fresh pot being brewed and adding it to my cup. By the time she finished, I had lost my appetite for the cup she prepared. Ew! I have to downgrade my original rating because of too many disappointing visits. It's a shame as it is not well managed and customer service training clearly lacking.  Earlier review: Adorable local coffee shop with an interesting array of local art on the wall. You'll know you've arrived when you spot the Ducati bike outside. I usually just get their coffee, which is always great, but they do serve lunch and breakfast, especially muffins and pastries. The only downside is that sometimes service is a tad slower than you'd like.",

The the girl working the front at 12am. You need to quit and work a job that doesn't involve working with people! Super rude and had a \"I'm over it\" vibe. Gross. And the food? Gross. My burrito was okay at BEST and his Gordo thing was absolutely disgusting.... even had a muffin at the end of our meal and it was rock hard. Go here if you wanna waste your money on overpriced food that's not great.",

I am not a vegan so I am not sure what different types of milk taste like but I am a regular coffee drinker and love coffee. I ordered a caramel macchiato with coconut milk. To me it was super sweet and tasted like gasoline. I could only drink two sips of it before I needed to throw it away. I definitely did not taste any coffee in it. The second star is for the Trump administration charicatures on the walls as decor. Those made me chuckle.",

I have not yet strayed from my usual Jackfruit Torta entree, so I don't know what their other vegan options are like, but the Jackfruit is bomb! It's flavorful and filling. I always get my order with a side of plain chips.    Don't forget to ask about the vegan desserts. Some are labeled, but not always.  And I've learned that the employees are not all educated on what is and isn't vegan, but one of the co-owners informed me that their apple pies are always vegan. I'll have to try the apple pie a la mode next time!  I have tried their brownie a la mode and their homemade toffee. Yum!   The parking lot is small and fills quickly. Prices are reasonable.  The patio is small but charming.  Did I mention that they're open 24/7??!  If they sold vegan pancakes, they'd be the hipster Denny's/IHOP.",

The only downfall of this place is the coffee ordered a white chocolate mocha that tasted more like chalk then an espresso beverage.

They usually have something GF in the pastry case as well, which means I'm in cafe heaven. You're not up-charged for non-dairy milk because that's all they carry. It's fantastic to patronize somewhere that has the same values I do.  I've been there many times, as it's a hot spot for the local live theater scene. This last weekend I had a lavender iced latte with soy milk and I was in heaven. I enjoyed it on the spacious patio and chatted with my sister. It was quiet perfection in the heart of sprawling Phx. N. Burns, the owner, is friendly and kind and a great supporter of the arts and his community. You can see this by the people he hires as well. They are all polite and informative and don't seem to mind when you take a few extra minutes to decide between the mixed berry GF scone or the GF apple muffin.  And they certainly don't judge you when you decide to have both.  This is a great place for a first date, a friend catch-up, or a pre-show drink. (YES! They have vegan cocktails and they are AMAZING!)",

Come on, guys. Why do you even have a menu if you're consistently out of so many ingredients? Every time I go to order food OR drink, I need to have at least two or three options in mind because they are, guaranteed, out of the stuff to make one or more of them.   It's gotten so frustrating, that I won't go to Urban Beans except for the patio during the cooler months. Copper Star has a great menu, always in stock. Lux has a full kitchen and bar, late hours, and they're always in stock. These places also rotate local art, Copper Star even offers jazz/blues music live on Sundays. There are just too many alternatives to Urban Beans to convince me to put up with this ridiculous stocking issue.  Urban Beans is a fantastic place to sit and work for a while, but don't come here for the food.",

Somewhere in-between Starbucks and Ultimate Hipster Coffee Lounge with a distinct leaning toward Ultimate Hipster.  *I love that this place features local art on its walls, most of it available for sale. BIG plus in my book. Music is decent without being too loud, which I appreciate.  **Unfortunately, when I asked for a pour-over, the barista had no idea what that meant, so minus one star from the coffee snob side of me; but the rest is a solid five-stars.  Food. My friend has been building this place up for days, particularly because of its delicious homemade pastries and diverse menu. I haven't eaten here yet, but everything LOOKS yum!  Oh, and did I mention that UB recently updated their hours to remain open 24/7? They're the only cafe I'm aware of in the area that does this. Major plus if they can afford to keep it up.  Ambiance is very relaxed. Makes a good \"work off-site\" location with comfy seating, free Wi-Fi, and even an outdoor patio for those more bearable months.  Coffee is nothing to get excited over, but I'd come back despite my snobby tendencies in that area. Service was good, too. Everyone seems to enjoy being here and you can feel that.

Coffee, purportedly medium roast, was way too weak to enjoy, as I am a \"stron coffee aficionado.\"  Blueberry Bran muffin was to die for.   Lady on counter was lost at using the available technology, must have been new. Not necessarily a \"do over\" because of the not very good coffee and proximity to Starbucks and Lux.  Two Stars because of the VERY GOOD Muffin!",

    "text": "My two co-workers and I went to UB for lunch today after another local restaurant was completely busy. I used to go to UB a lot before my job relocated so I recommended we went there based on my previous experiences a couple of years ago.  We got there at noon and I ordered an omelet which included oven roasted potatoes and 3 basic ingredients. In addition I added a \"premium\" ingredient; cheese and ordered a small white chocolate mocha. My bill came out to around $16.00 which I thought was a little pricey. One of my co-workers order an English muffin and the other ordered an omelet as well.   At around 12:30 they both went to check on the order and were told they needed 10 more minutes to finish making our food. At 12:38, I went back to ask about our food which one of the guys was already placing it in his hands to take our orders to us. I asked him what took so long and he apologized and told me he was new and so was the cook. He then told me they were both left alone which delayed things. I was annoyed that it took so long because we had to be back at work at 1:00 but I didn't say anything more and sat down.  As I went to quickly eat my food I realized two things: Our oven roasted potatoes were missing and we had cold and wet scrambled eggs on our plate, not an omelet.  I went back inside and told the same guy that our potatoes were missing and he said: \"I'm sorry, do you need them.\" to which I responded that I did not need them but I paid for them. He offered to have the potatoes made for us, however at this point we were already so late that I was concerned about the length of time it would take to have those out. He also offered me a refund which I explained to him that I appreciated the offer but I was not looking for free food and did not want to take money away from a small local business. I added that I was just frustrated with the situation and agreed to have the potatoes made to go while I ran back out to inhale my food. The cook came out about 5 minutes later and gave us the to- go boxes and apologized as well, stating they were both left alone and were new to the job.  I felt so bad for them because although I was not mean, they could definitely see I was very irritated. It was not their fault they were left there alone yet they were the ones that had to listen to me vent. I hope that whoever manages these two employees takes the time to properly train them before leaving them alone. The place was not busy at all which makes me wonder what they would've done under even more pressure of having more people to serve. Needless to say, I was late, the food had no taste and it was pricey. I left very disappointed from this place.",

    "text": "Friday - after a very long work week, I was tired. Driving up 7th street and dying for some great coffee, I spotted Urban Beans Cafe and decided to make a pit stop.   Open 7x24x365, Urban Beans is a refuge for people to sit, work, read, have a great conversation, and enjoy life.   Priority order #1 was a large German chocolate cold brewed iced coffee and it was excellent. Just what I needed!   I pondered the menu, and once sufficiently caffeinated, I thought I'd have a Quesadilla with everything, an Italian Calzone, the piece de resistance (for me anyway) a Pastrami Ruben, and an Apple Oat Muffin.   The Pastrami Ruben was so good. The flavors of sauerkraut mixed with plant based pastrami were excellent.   The smell emanating from the Italian Calzone was a bouquet of heavenly pizza. I could tell immediately it was fresh baked and home made. After it cooled a bit, the first bite just made me euphoric to be alive, and suddenly I was glad it's Friday. Now I'm ready for the weekend!  Not having gastronomic height, width, or depth to consume the Quesadilla, it will be my lunch tomorrow along with the Apple Oat Muffin.  If you need somewhere to relax, have some great food and excellent coffee, Urban Beans Cafe will provide a deliciously urban atmosphere to refresh your psyche. Cya here sometime!",

But what makes it stand apart is this: it makes almost everything from scratch, is open 24 hours and also serves alcohol. The holy trinity and an utter rarity.  I got the vegan lasagna ($9) for lunch and wow, it blew me away. It might be the best lasagna I've ever had; they make the noodles, the sauce and the seitan all in-house, amazingly. It was fresh, bursting with flavor and just spectacular.   There are places in LA and New York and Portland that charge twice as much for hastily-assembled, mostly store-bought lasagnas (I'm looking at you, Crossroads in Los Angeles) that taste half as good. Urban Beans really takes things to a different level.  I also got a chocolate chip cookie ($2) which tasted great.  Urban Beans falls into a great niche---you could come to work, for a meal or even a date (if the person is cool). There aren't many spots like this in the US.  I wish every town had a place like Urban Beans and I can't wait to come back when I'm next in Phoenix.",

Pastries on point, lasagna at 2am, staff always smiling and having a good time. I cherish this place and dream of a day when we get more of a late night food scene in town. Until that happens, I'll keep stopping by for a late night reuben and scone. UB is the perfect central phx sanctuary for studying, catching up with friends, or enjoying the patio and the food is delicious. Things are a little more laid out here, don't come if your in a rush, but maybe that's more of what the world needs these days anyways.",

The pastry case was full and well organized and everything looked appetizing.  It was hard to make a decision but we got the breakfast calzone to share and a pear scone.  There was also a lady working who seemed to be the owner who was also warm and welcoming.  They talked about their holiday pies which sounded amazing! I will definitely be ordering for Christmas.

The espresso machines also looked like they hadn't been cleaned for a while.   Though I appreciate it being a 24-hour establishment, I highly recommend a much-needed renovation and regular cleaning schedule. The one positive was the staff. The guy that helped me was pretty nice, though not very attentive. I had already ordered before taking a real look around and didn't feel comfortable drinking my coffee once I paid, so I threw it away after I left. I honestly feel like someone could get really sick from eating here.",

The furniture appear to be a combination of colors and decor that seemed to contradict each other, while at the same time it wasn't distracting at all. We were told that the caramel that was in our drink was made in house and the man behind the counter was just the friendliest, most accommodating barista ever. I think the only downside is that there was a surprising amount of flies hovering around when we visited. It could be due to foot traffic and the opening of the doors into the warm shop. It didn't bother me too much, but that could be because we grabbed our drinks and only stayed until our drinks arrived before we departed.",

Being a new-ish vegan, I opened up the Happy Cow app on my phone and saw Urban Beans. Perfect! First off, I work for Starbucks, and I passed by at least 2 Starbucks to come to Urban Beans.  And I'm not disappointed.  I chose the GF banana oat walnut muffin and an iced hibiscus tea.  The muffin is delicious, the tea is exactly what I needed, and I am grateful for the free WiFi. Man, I wish we had a cafe like this back home.  I'd apply to work here and I'd come here every day.",

They have yet to decline my request for sliced tomatoes instead of the potatoes that  normally come with this selection.  The cold brew, which I always order, is always smooth and clean. Never over boiled or burnt, never bitter.  There are receptacles and power strips available for charging computers etc. A nice atmosphere with different seating options and music that charms without being intrusive.

    "text": "Cue the circus music.   Here's the deal; the staff are epic. Talented, communicative, fun, friendly, inviting, worthy of mass praise across the board. There are few coffee shops in phoenix that offer a non-pretentious experience, that also happen to employ logic based staff who operate with an above average level of competency. It's impressive to find this in PHX, let alone at a 24 hour spot. The staff get 5 HUGE Stars, no doubt.  ...and they make the best MF'ing Jackfruit Breakfast Burrito this mouth has ever masticated, courtesy of Chef-God Ivan the Great. If you don't know what Jackfruit is, get your ass in here and nom your way to a quivering mouth-gasm.  Latte's are on FLEEK by the always impressive Super-Brenda, and so is the wi-fi speed - which is never slow, even when the place is stacked with the always entertaining, caffein saturated college crowd. I really can't say enough about the return on investment from an employee & food/drink standpoint. You won't find better in PHX - especially at 2am.   So why 1 Star? Because despite how exceptional many of the staff are, the owners clearly have no concept of what effective business leadership requires. Their staff operate from a dwarfed position of generalized disenfranchisement. Spend 10 minutes with any of them and you can see how unappreciated, neglected, and overall, undervalued they are. We see this in the way they are treated, the lack of resources that they are provided with to make the UB experience what it really COULD be, lack of time-off, open all holidays (which is BS), etc.   This is not information that the employees disseminate, but after talking with most of them at length, and witnessing the truth of it from the \"customer\" perspective - over the course of weeks of 1st person exposure, the truth becomes evident - pissing off us loyal customers.  As a multi-business owner, I understand that there is nothing more critical for business success than employee satisfaction. When your employees feel valued, and appreciated, they become the most influential mouthpiece a company can ever hope to have - worth their weight in gold.   The fact that Urban Beans' owners do not recognize this - illustrated by the sheer number of AWESOME, yet broken-down employees Urban Beans employs - is infuriating for those of us who respect the work these hustlin' folks produce - in the trenches, building the Urban Beans brand with every new customer who walks through the door.   Having been to Urban Beans dozens of times over the past several months, my wife and I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to get to know many of the great staff here. As much as I don't want to support UB ownership, I cannot imagine NOT supporting their employees, who make the brand what it is. They are the lifeblood, the heartbeat of the UB experience. Without them, UB is nothing more than another failed, vacant commercial property, skid marking the Phoenix landscape.   So, to re-cap:   *Crappy ownership *Failed management *Talented (yet undervalued) chefs & baristas  *MF'ing EPIC Jackfruit Burritos *Dope ass latte's *Favorable wifi *Casual, friendly, non-pretentious environment *Open 24 hours  ...and can I just say, WTF is with all the damn FISH art all around the place? As a visual artist, I appreciate all expressions of creativity, but enough is enough.   Well done UB employees, for rising to the occasion, despite all the obstacles that are constantly being placed in your way. Mad respect. ((Hat Tip))  UB owners/managers - get a fu#!ing clue. Business management 101, take care of your staff.",

As a consultant without an office, I love when I can find a place with free WiFi where I work for several hours. Although my experience is that the baristas/servers change often, they are most often kind and helpful. My greatest complaint is that in all the years I've been to UB their restrooms are DIRTY. Bathrooms are unisex...which is fine. But when I walk in with the toilet seat up and it's covered in urine drops...it's gross. I've literally walked in to one of the restrooms and there was who knows what all over the seat. I walked out. This bothers me not only when I need to use the restroom but also because Dept of health folks always say that if the bathroom is not well kept,  question the kitchens cleanliness. I looked for their letter rating...maybe I missed it somewhere.",

After waking up at the god awful hour of 6am on a Saturday (garbage I know lol), I decided to drag my half awake self over here for some breakfast. My mom had given me a coupon from her entertainment book for a bogo deal.   First impression from the outside, cute. I like the mismatched furniture outside. And since it was cool enough out this past weekend, we were able to sit out there and not roast. It kind of went downhill from there, sadly. When we walked in, there were more employee's than customers, and we were not greeted with even a hello. That bugged me. Second, the menu was very underwhelming. Since both my son and I are picky, we stuck with simple items. I got the potato cheese and egg burrito, he got the egg and cheese English muffin and a blackberry lime scone. The scone was actually very good, the other items were just okay. I also ordered a hot chai latte and a cold horchata for the little one. Those were good as well.   Overall, I was just very unimpressed with the place. The prices are reasonable, great location, but other than that, there is nothing that makes me want to come back here.",

The patio and atmosphere are also top notch for either reading or quiet conversation with friends.

The place was small and could use some updating with their decoration. They had a nice patio area to sit and hang out which I loved, but the seats were kindda dirty so we weren't comfortable sitting on it. The staff were nice and friendly, so I will give them credit for that. We must of caught them on a bad night because their oven was down and most items were out, so we couldn't order any food. The only thing that we could order was the hummas dish which we regret. It was $8 but was cold and dry, not very appealing at all. The drinks however was not so bad.

    "text": "Phoenix seems to lack good coffeehouses in general (hey, I'm from the Northwest, and am accustomed to many good coffeehouses sprinkled all over town within blocks of each other), but this one I like.  I tried Copper Star, Fair Trade, LUX, Lola, and Conspire during the year and a half we lived there and none provided the atmosphere of a True coffeehouse where you can relax, listen to music, converse with friends, and maybe view some local art while chowing on a healthy snack...except Urban Beans.  The owner works the counter, is conversational and friendly, and really enjoys what she does.  The coffee shops in Phoenix tend to be so small that the enjoyment of the patrons really seems like an afterthought.  Every coffee shop we visited (except Urban Beans) had no seating room.  Kids (I use that term loosely...think 23 and under) bring in their laptops, order a drip coffee, and sit all day long taking up space that others could be using while enjoying a coffee. The kids who work at the coffeehouses don't seem to care because it's their FRIENDS who are hanging out on the couches the entire day.  Urban Beans is for grown-ups and for people who want to experience good coffee in a friendly atmosphere, while nibbling on a salad, then continuing with life elsewhere after an hour or so of kabitzing.    Gawd, I sound old! :)",

    "text": "So...I want to like this place due to the convenient location.  There were a couple of good experiences - coffee was pretty good, lentil soup was really good.  Service was 'meh'.  But the bad experiences were so bizarre, I don't think I'll be coming back.  1: In a hurry to pick up my sister from work, I stopped by to grab a to-go snack for the both of us.  Goat cheese/pesto/sundried tomato tart?  Sounds delicious!  It was delicious upon tasting it.  However, there were bits of *sharp* broken plastic lodged in the goat cheese, (which, by the way, I chewed on until I realized that it wasn't a really dry tomato, but in fact plastic).  I took a picture, then called to provide a friendly, \"FYI - this happened.  I don't know how this happened, but you might want to investigate.\"  She was friendly enough, but incredulous, (are you sure this didn't somehow magically happen inside the closed to-go bag/box while you were driving?) - lending to the worry that nothing was done in terms of investigation.  I tossed the rest of it, (to the dismay of my hungry sister), for fear of destroying her insides.  2: Upon the next visit, (a week or so later), I stopped in to have the soup, since the lentil was great the last time I had soup here.  They didn't have the lentil, but they did have the roasted red pepper.  When I came to order, the guy at the counter informed me that they only had enough soup left for one cup, and that he wanted it.  I couldn't tell if he was joking, but after a long stare, he placed the order.  When I went to pay, he informed me that I wouldn't have to pay sales tax today because their 'system was down'.  Thanks?  That sounds...a bit unethical, but okay.  Soup finally came out, (was told the reason it took a while because there was work going on in the back).  Delicious, much like the lentil soup.  But as I was eating, I noticed the contractors working in the kitchen were on ladders doing something to the ceiling.  Above where the food is being prepared.   No bits of ceiling in the soup, thankfully.  But wow.  Like I said - very torn.  The food is great tasting, but I shouldn't have to worry about ingesting foreign objects upon each visit.",

    "text": "I live in the area and I have been very interested in trying this out. They have also certificates on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> but I did not purchase one. I definitely have my favorite coffee shops but I am always open to adding another one to the list. I took my daughter with me, along with some children's books to read on a rainy, AZ day. I got myself an sugar-free vanilla nonfat latte and my daughter a kids hot chocolate. I had to repeat my latte order like 3 times to the male employee and after I got it, waited for it to cool down and took a sip, I realized they never added the syrup. Pretty annoying given how many times I had to remind the guy what I ordered as he rung me up. The lady who made my daughter's hot chocolate added whipped cream and chocolate syrup and didn't make it too hot, which I really appreciated. My daughter still ended up spilling it on her white shirt. What I was thinking???? A 3 year old, hot chocolate and a white shirt?? Aahhh, the never-ending lessons of a new mom. Since I forgot to bring a snack for my daughter, I ordered a blueberry muffin for her and a chocolate chip cookie for me. Both were extremely good. The total for the drinks and food were just under $9 which I think is standard. As I looked in the display case, at the food, there was a pretty good variety. As other reviewers mentioned, the chairs are mismatched throughout. I found a table with a comfy chair (all of the other chairs were the standard, hard, wooden) since I planned to have my daughter in my lap as we read.   Overall, I would say I enoyed my time here (besides the drink mistake). I wish they had some arm chairs or couches or something but maybe they will in the future. There were alot of people here so U.B. seemed to be popular. I'm not sure if I would come back but maybe. I'm intrigued by the BYOB and the variety of events they have.",

I ordered up a nonfat vanilla latte, iced and the gal that made it made it perfectly! The flavor is all there and the espresso--delish! I also ordered the farm egg sandwich. While it was good, I probably wouldn't order it again. The egg is mixed with peppers and spices to give it a kick but it wasn't my cup of tea. The sandwich was supposed to come with an English muffin but I actually think I was given a bagel. When you're trying to watch your carb intake, it was just too much bread.  This all said, I rate this joint 4 stars. coffee is 5 but the sandwich portion knocked it down one. I'll stop back in again for some coffee and after 10 visit, their loyalty program will give me 10% off!",

The location is also unbeatable, walking distance from my place. But the service has always been sub-par, like it's a bother to take my order and converse with me.  Everyone here, including most of the clientele, seem way too cool for school.  The iced tea, my usual, is good; the iced coffee is great-tons of flavor and plenty of body. Espresso drinks are pretty standard for your indie coffee shop. I've asked for their vegan pastry (which changes daily) three times only to be told that they ran out for the day. I know that this happens, and I love that they freshly bake their goodies everyday and have a rotating menu, but I would also like to try the vegan scone sometime please.  Today, I ordered a strawberry-raspberry-cranberry smoothie ($5 for a small!) and confirmed with the boy behind the counter that the smoothies are vegan/non-dairy. He said yes then informed me that they use Naked juices for the base then just add fruit and ice. (Naked juice! So that's where the $5 price tag comes from!) Three minutes later, I was handed a delicious looking smoothie topped with...whipped cream...?  Really?!",

They'll soon have a full dinner menu as well.  We packed the house for a free wine pairing [I know it's a small business and know how much Virginia Senior, proprietress sacrificed] on their regular 'BU Thursday' wine pairing event - a mere $15 normally.  Virginia, at least for me, your sacrifice will not have been in vain - you've secured 2 new regular customers!  The sommelier's discernment shined brightly and the chef's pairing choices were competent and then some - I rarely get the 'frisson' I experienced in the Queso Manchego paired with the 2008 Edge Cabernet.  You won't regret showing up next Thursday for their weekly wine pairing.",

Now, take a look at all the other reviews and people rave about it - so take it as you will, but I will not be returning here for the coffee/espresso. It's a serious bummout for me, because I like most everything else about this place.  However, they have a GREAT selection of loose-leaf teas that smell like heaven. And it's an awesome place to work from - tons of windows with plenty of sunshine and a great patio. You just have to ask for the wi-fi code.   The employees seem genuine and cordial, and I dig the fact that they have open mic nights and live music acts. I dig it as a cool joint to hang out at.  It's a decent location with parking that has never been full for me.   My favorite thing? They sell gluten-free goodies like biscotti and english muffins. Who knows if they rotate their GF selection, but I really appreciate any place that caters to my kind. AND it seems like they have a pretty big menu for a coffee house (like REAL food too).   Summary: coffee? Not my thing here. Tea? Yes, please. Working? Pretty decent. Gluten-free selection? They are trying and that's all that counts.",

Why you would go to Starbux when you have this across the street boggles my mind. If you hang out here for a while you will literally hear \"I'm going to go make an apple pie\" and similar such statements from the baristas. Plus, they were slow bringing me my lunch (I didn't care and was clearly here to stay) because they were roasting the tomatoes, so they brought me a free drink. Plenty of good seating, great wifi, a good outdoor patio, easy parking, clean bathroom, good art, and hip and good looking clientele of all ages.

My mother and I both ordered pumpkin pecan scones and I ordered a iced latte. The pumpkin pecan scones texture was good but it didn't taste anything like pumpkin and only really tasted like a flavorless scone with pecans in it. So usually I get iced lattes at least once or twice a week at different coffee shops that I normally go too and I expected this iced latte to taste as good or even better than my other ones but I was extremely disappointed with this one especially. First of all, the lady who made the drinks was extremely sloppy with making them and she made my drink spill all over the counter and it was dripping on the side of my cup and I had to clean it up myself. She didn't even put a lid or straw in it for me I had to do it myself too. The taste in the latte was horrible too. The coffee shop was so sloppy and we ordered for here but they put our scones in a to-go bag and the cashier even forgot to bring us up. Overall I am disappointed with this cafe and most likely would not come back here or even recommended it to anyone.",

The first and most important question is \"How's the coffee?\"  I ordered a regular drip coffee and the barista (who was very nice and eager to answer my questions) served it to me... cold. The hot drip coffee was cold. And it tasted burnt. Bad on two counts.  My cohort ordered an espresso and was served promptly. Unfortunately, his espresso was also subpar due to it's over-extraction.  The furniture was mismatched (but not in that fun, quirky way... more of a \"we stopped by a garage sale and this is what we found\" way). The light fixtures were interesting but cast shadows directly on the artwork. Typically, I'd say that's bad form. On a positive note, the concrete floors were nice, and I was partial to their rugs.  Their menus looked like a ripoff of Lux's glass window pane menus, but their merch area felt like a cross section of a duty-free airport gift shop. Pairing that with the chairs from various time periods and places, Urban Beans felt like it was trying to be several different shops at once.  If you try to please everybody, you'll please nobody.",

The coffee was really good and smooth - not over roasted or too strong/weak and had a really nice sweet toffee flavour. The cupcake was a little more thick and cold than I prefer (I like my cake more fluffy/airy and room temperature) but was really good and not too sugary. The scone was definitely better, though. The only problem was that the coffees did take a long time to come out and it wasn't that busy, but there was only one barista and I didn't pay attention to the line length. Seems like a great neighbourhood spot, though. There was a live guitar player at the time which was kind of neat but strange on a Saturday morning.",

    "text": "I want to start by saying, I have always loved this place. They have one of the best iced coffees in Phoenix and I love their farm egg sandwich. However, I was there today for a mid day meeting and figured I would try their lunch. I ordered the pear, arugula melt flatbread. The description sounded yummy, but it didn't live up to the menu at all. First of all, it was so drenched in the balsamic glaze that I couldn't really taste anything else. I didn't taste or see any pears at all (but my be due to the massive amount of balsamic glaze) and there was hardly any arugula on the flatbread- seemed more like a garnish than part of the dish.  The service was really lacking today. I think they were training 2 new people and the they seemed really confused and didn't even know what I was ordering- like they had not even looked at the menu at all. I will definitely go back but will stick to my iced coffee and farm egg sandwich in the future.",

I've been coming here for 3+ years and will always return for the warm ambiance and super friendly service. Oh and they have free wi-fi, a cute wine bar, great happy hour and lunch/dinner savory options too. Enjoy!",

One draw back today was that one of the bathrooms was out of order and the other needed a small amount of cleaning. All in all I was a great experience and I'd definitely recommend it.",

The to-go cups are biodegradable, the coffee is local and organic, the pastries are baked on site, the used coffee grounds are composted, and the extra pastries are donated.   The drinks are quite tasty as well. Although I haven't been in a while to try newer items, all of the classic stuff is delicious! I also recommend the cardamom cake if it's still offered--it tastes like a chai tea in cake form. Yum!",

I was going to drink my drink and eat my scone there but the service was so bad I decided it would be better to walk home and enjoy it there instead. On the up side the vanilla latte was delicious and their scones were great! I just wish the service was friendlier  I went again trying to give it a second chance, but that time it was an older woman and she was distant as well and was having a conversation with another customer the whole time I was trying to order, it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable so I once again just walked home to eat instead of staying there.",

First of all, they have a very cozy patio with canopy style roofing and large bulb stranded lights (they weren't on because it was 11am).   The interior is larger than you'd expect. Counter with 2 bakery cases (chuck full of pies, muffins, cupcakes, brownies, etc.) side bar area, two seating areas (one medium with window seating, one large with couches more appropriate for longer period of sitting).   I ordered the caramel toffee nut mocha and a gluten-free red velvet cupcake, came out to be $8. Not bad. My coffee was a large and lemme tell you, it's very large. I'm gittery just typing this but in the best way possible. The cupcake was delightful, huge thick topping of sprinkled icing and a yummy, moist cake bottom.  The staff is very friendly. In fact, I was complimented twice in a matter of the 20 minutes I was there on my outfit so you know the staff has to be friendly if they're attracting such pleasant merchants too.  I will def go back here.",

The truth is, I don't really care about your iced tea, which IS tasty, and I don't really care about your Caprese sandwich (which I have devoured numerous times).  What I REALLY, really love...  is your muffins.  You are magic with the muffins.  I have had every flavor you sell, I think, and each one has been more delicious than the last, with my favorite being the raspberry mango.  I always tell myself I will save some for later.    Turns out later is about 15 seconds after \"before.\"  Thank you for allowing me to have my dogs (both big and small) on your patio.  Thank you for understanding that I prefer four-legged children to two.  Thank you for having doable business hours, great prices, and EVEN for having irresistible homemade pasta in your establishment for me to take home and cook later.  I just love you, Urban Beans!",

It's a relaxed, friendly atmosphere, and the people who work here feel like genuinely good people.  No pretentiousness at all.

The coffee is delicious. I had a caramel latte and it was delicious and beautiful. The staff is super friendly and personable. I will say that the seating isn't the most comfortable and finding outlets for your computer is at times challenging.  I've had coffee, baked goods and tea from here and I've enjoyed all. You will get a unique group of people depending on the time you go, but that adds to the fun and ambiance of the place. Oh, and best thing...I can study and have a beer at the same time. While some may see this as counterproductive it can help to clear the mind and reduce anxiety (my own opinion). Definitely check this place out for coffee, studying, relaxing, or whatever. I think you'll be happy you did.",

Because it's open 24 hours, it's a reliable place to hunker down even during holidays. I've had various experiences with the food, but 9 times out of 10 I'm very pleased. The curry is my favorite for lunch or dinner, but the scones have also been delicious in the past. They tend to \"run out\" of ingredients, but they have a descent sized menu, so I've never been frustrated by it.  The one drawback is that alcoholic drinks are not cheap and their \"happy hour\" ends at 2 or 3pm. So if you're looking for a place to work a while and then have a cocktail, I'd recommend several other places, like Desoto downtown.",

The people behind the counter are friendly and smiley. Service could be a little faster but the fact these guys stay busy is a testament to Arizona's love for local businesses.

You never know what your drink will taste like even when you order the same thing, depending on who is working that day. And to not stock the shop with everything you need and still charge the same outrageous price makes no sense. I'm done trying. No offense to the working staff, but they are being failed.",

The pizza pocket I had was mostly bread and although they claimed it came with marinara ( well seasoned!! ) it was not properly reduced to be that. The bread itself was under-baked and had a soggy bottom. You can use a rolling pin or even wine bottle with rubber bands to create an even level for the dough to create a consistent bake and avoiding the insanely thick bottom. Pizza should be GB&D always, even if you are going to reheat it, usually a good even brown will be fine, take it to European brown for reheat. I would reduce down that really tasty marinara a bit more, blend it with an immersion blender would be perfect.  As for the coffee, all about temperature control and time management. Such a fricken nice espresso machine. I have faith in y'all, make people understand how awesome you are. Just refine it a bit",

    "text": "This is my second time here but my first review the first time I came I got the bean burrito which was super super spectacular and an iced chai! This time I got an iced chai and a banana nut muffin, and I must say their iced chai is probably the best I've ever had (as you can see I keep coming back) lol And the banana nut muffin is to die for! The staff is nice there was two girls when I came in one of the girls was getting yelled at by another customer (not too sure why because she's really sweet and it didn't seem like she did anything wrong) and I was the customer after him and she dusted the situation off like It didn't even happen. I definitely commend her for that!! Only reason why I give this place for out of five stars is because the first time I came in I wouldn't say the staff was rude but they just really weren't that attentive.",

    "text": "I'm very excited about this place. It reminds me of a long-gone coffee shop in Sedona called Cups. No two chairs, tables, or coffee cups were the same. There was artwork packed on the walls made by local artists...all for sale...and the place was charming. But no more. It got bulldozed for the sake of a larger strip mall. Progress, right?  Urban Beans reminds me of Cups. Most of the chairs and tables are wildly different (some of the chairs are too wild...they are impossible to walk around which can be a nuisance if the place is busy), and there is some art on the walls available for sale.   The pastries are wonderful, and their menu items are fantastic. The coffee tastes wonderful, and I should know, because I've been in the industry for many years.   The people behind the counter are helpful and friendly. Can't ask for more.   The only critique is that the walls are a bit in a state of disrepair and the lighting needs to be tweaked a bit. This location is on the brink of becoming a TOP NOTCH place to go. Phoenix LACKS culture and art (First Friday is a laughable waste of time), and Urban Beans stands to be the game-changer in this arena.   Take note, Phoenix! Urban Beans is a wonderful hangout, and it poised to start a new trend in coffee shops and hangouts. I am exited to see what the future holds.",

It's a spacious room with white walls, mismatched chairs and tables.   It's a good place to come and chill out. It's very quiet and laid back.   I did have the red velvet cupcake they had once before and I wasn't a fan. But it wasn't terrible.   I like to meet up with one of my friends here from time to time. The patio is nice, but it's alongside a busy street so it's a little noisy.   Service depends on who is there.

I spouted my order only to be shut down as they were out of that item.... I decided to just get whatever as I've already invested 25 minutes into this fiasco.

There are so many tables here. No couches, which I thought I would miss, but I actually don't mind. All the chairs are different at every table which gives it an organized antique look. The area rugs bring warmth to it as well. I am set up next to a window, watching people and cars pass by as I \"work.\"  There is also a covered patio for nice days. I can't wait for the weather to warm up a bit so I can try that out.  I ordered a toffee nut mocha and bought some home made toffee. The coffee came to me with a cute foam feather and a tasty coffee too. Not sweet and was a strong coffee. Exactly what I needed.   The toffee is sooooo addicting. A caramel, buttery chunk with nuts and covered in chocolate. I can't wait to try the other cakes and muffins here too.  I commend Urban Beans for making this a great escape from the day.",

It's not watered down or flavorless like some of the other coffee shops. It's flavorful and yummy in my tummy with just the right amount of spices and herbs, the way chai tea is supposed to taste like. They also have a great patio to just sit back, relax, and read a book.",

    "text": "First I ordered two drinks, and the man behind me ordered something more difficult than mine to make.  After waiting for seven minutes, I came back to discover that the barista finished his drink and hadn't even started on mine. She made mine finally, at this point I had waited over 15 minutes. I ordered a sweet drink, and it seriously was the most bitter drink I had ever had at any coffee shop. I don't even know what she made. The espresso tasted weird... So I asked her to remake it because there was no way I could drink any of it. This time I waited another 10 minutes for my drink, and I saw that she had used milk instead of almond milk like I requested. I'm allergic to milk. At this point it had been about 30 minutes since I ordered the first time and I was getting pretty damn frustrated. I asked once more if she could just remake them. I also requested a refund because of how long we were waiting. She finally finished my drinks about 45 minutes later. Get this. The manager or team lead guy came out and asked if everything was okay. We told him what happened, how it took 45 minutes to make a drink. (They weren't even busy, it was 11:30pm) and it took three times to get it right. He asked us if the drinks were fine now, and that if they were there was no refund needed. TERRIBLE customer service. Needless to say, we aren't coming back here. I don't recommend it. Go to Jobot instead.",

    "text": "I USED to brag about Urban Beans to everyone I know. I used to hang out there at least 3 times a week. THEN something horrifying happened, my once favorite coffee place changed! & it morphed into something no longer identifiable. I took my mother to Urban Beans, upon walking in the door the entire restaurant was permeated by extreme body odor. Not only was the smell gagging, but all but 1 of the tables was dirty. The only 1 without dirty dishes was sticky. Still, we attempted to order coffee however, a large mocha & a small black coffee was apparently a brain teaser for the barista. Our simple order was messed up twice. We tried again, by ordering bread pudding French toast. Alas, this was again a big mistake. Not only was our food served cold, it came with no utensils. I was so embarrassed I spent the entire afternoon apologizing to my mom. I have never been back nor will I ever go back. PSA-There is a Tip Jar located at the register but beware, our very astute & creative barista automatically added a 15% gratuity to our bill. AND never request a glass of water or you will be pointed to an empty pitcher without a glass to be found within the vicinity of this zip code. Frightful indeed.",

I can take solace in their georgia peach tea and gluten-free/vegan english muffin. Toasted with just the right preserves, it makes my belly happy. I cheated on my diet but that's okay. Just don't tell my doctor.  I have always been a fan of their food. I did knock this down to 4 stars because they seem to have dumped a lot of the vegan/gluten-free options they used to have. Super sad face.  Also, there was a very loud man in there asking for money, yesterday. But he quickly left. Loud conversation is very distracting. It is not the quietest coffee shop if there are many people, but it is still nice!",

Stark white walls with local art -- the two owners are the first to show their work.  Pastries brought in from a number of local bakeries.  A glass menu board.  Free Wi-Fi with password.  I ordered an espresso macchiato my two times in and got two different prices ($2.50 the first time, $1.30 the second).  I was told today when I picked up my order that the cashier (owner?) rung up the order wrong and next time the price would be correct.  No big deal.  The coffee is not Lux nor Copper Star, but I'd put it on par with Drip and Fair Trade.  Not a complex taste, but it does the trick.  Not a lot of action in here either visit.  One or two people at any given time over a few hours.  The music is hit or miss, but volumed well, and unobtrusive.  One of the barristas mentioned that they'd like to serve beer/wine some day and they have the makings of a walk-in cooler, replete with pounded copper door.    Indeed Phoenix could use more places where city dwellers drinking coffee can sidle up next to someone drinking a beer.",

I ended up going two days in a row.  Visit One:  The decor is not really noteworthy.  I'm not a furniture snob, I just know what I like.  Urban Beans is fairly cluttered.  My first instinct was to go with the strawberry scone.  It looked gorgeous.  Since I hadn't had breakfast, however, I decided to try the urban french toast (or whatever they call it).  It is a baked french toast and the description sounded great.  The french toast itself?  Terrible.  It was pretty much like regular toast.  Parts of it were totally dry and it had zero flavor.  It was actually served with real maple syrup (normally a plus), but it this case, a True waste.  I ordered an iced toddy because I wanted something cool.  It had a strange aftertaste.    Visit Two:  Today I decided to try a blueberry peach scone.  The flavor was OK but it was fairly dry.  To drink, I ordered an iced Americano.  This was an improvement over the toddy but still, not great coffee.  After giving it two tries, I really don't see a reason to go back to Urban Beans.",
