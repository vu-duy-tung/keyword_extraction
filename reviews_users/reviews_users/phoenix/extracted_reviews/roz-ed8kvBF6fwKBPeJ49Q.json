    "text": "OK. I have to start by saying that not everything was bad during this visit. However my first impression of the staff was disappointing. My husband and I walked in and literally stood there for at least 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. There were 2 waiters that passed us and looked at us but continued on their way. One waiter, an older silver haired man, acknowledged us finally to say to give them a few minutes. The young woman arrived after a few moment and sat us. She seemed very sweet and eager to please. I love Italian food and I understand the wait is part of the experience. However, the bread was late and it took a while for the water as well.  But like I said not all the experience was bad, The entree was pretty good. The soup was not, it really tasted and looked like it came out of a can, sorry. I mean, it you dont all the stuff I mentioned please come to this restaurant. The ALfredo and the ravioli was pretty delicious. As for me, this was our first and last venture to Tutti.",

    "text": "This is a good neighborhood traditional Italian restaurant. The food has been great and consistent. Nice ambience with fun Dean Martin standard music. But the last few times, we've had a \"crabby New Yorker\" type as a server (my family is from New York, so I feel OK making that generalization) who is not particularly helpful with any questions we ask him, condescending and rude even.  While that might work at a hotdog cart in Manhattan, it doesn't work for me. I think we deserve better given that our meal was over  $75, and that is without wine.   We like the food here but this time we thought we might not come back due to the attitude of the server.  If we had a nice server, I would definitely give Tutti Santi 5 stars.",

    "text": "It's in a kind of nice area in Phoenix. The dish I got was gnocchi noodles with a white sauce. Kinda plain but my favorite noodles are the gnocchi noodles so I really didn't care. I went for my best friends birthday with her and her parents and a couple who is family friends of them. It's very cute on the inside. But the waiter we had was nice at certain times but mean and annoyed at others and he made it very obvious. I tried to be very understanding because I used to be a waitress and I didn't like it but still. He had explained the specials that night and my best friend asked later if that was one who thing or separate dishes and if it actually had noodles and instead he just repeated what it was and you could tell he was annoyed. And then I asked about the soup, knowing that he had already explained what the special soup was but I asked what it was because I thought there was more than that and then he huffed and puffed so instead of explaining myself to him I just ordered the salad because he was being rude. I also had the Italian cappuccino which I can't handle non flavored so it was a bit hard for me to drink all of it without having two packets of sugar. I shared with my best friend. For dessert I had the tiramisu which is my all time favorite dessert/cake. It was alright. I know every place makes it different but I would have to say I like it better at Olive Garden. Which is sad cause I don't even know if it's homemade there. There is a chance that it's frozen from there. But if you do go there the food is pretty good. Just be careful which server you get.",

    "text": "We had a dinner reservation for a party of six on Friday 1/19 at 6:30.  To our surprise there was a camera crew from Channel 12 news in the bar area filming a segment for the news.  We were led to a table in a small room off of the bar area and seated at a very dark table next to the cart with all the glassware and linens, not a very desirable table.  The really nice table was reserved for the news crew who ended up filming their interview with Nina and her granddaughter right across from where we sat.  We had a female waitress who was not very attentive to us, to say the least.  We ordered a bottle of wine, a couple of cocktails and two appetizers. She disappeared for long periods of time.  When my husband ordered his second cocktail, she asked, \"do you want a fresh glass with ice or are you alright with this glass?\"  I was speechless.  Our entrees took over an hour to be served, meanwhile, we had no water, no bread plates.  We were definitely the forgotten table.  At the end of the meal,my husband had to flag her down for the check.  No complimentary after dinner Sambuca, no complimentary birthday cake for Grandma.  It was such a disappointing evening.  Seems everyone was starstruck that night in hopes of making the cut for the news segment.  We will not be back, which is a shame as this used to be one of our favorite places.",

This place is very close and had good reviews so we gave it a try. The restaurant was not crowded or loud, was nice to be able to chat and hear the conversation without screaming over the table. Large selection of wines (both white and red) for reasonable prices. Had the mozzarella capresse. I'm a picky eater and was unsure but my coworker ordered it so I had to try. It was really good. A great light appetizer. They was no soup option, so we got the salads. Again, delicious,  light but flavorful. There was grated cheese on the table and I enjoyed that on top. I ordered the gnocchi because the reviews were so good and my colleague got the veil parmasean. I was worried if the gnocchi would be filling since it had no meat and Debra assured me it would be. She was SO right! I was so satiated once I finished my plate. The white sauce with a hint of the sweet red sauce had me savoring (& scraping my plate) with each bite. The gnocchi were the perfect texture, I may order again before I head back home (don't judge). My colleague enjoyed the veil dish, it wasn't too heavy and drowned in sauce. There was a good crispy coating and felt \"very authentic\". I agree 100%. The moment we walked in and smelled garlic, we were sold. The great service by Debra and the amazing amazing food definitely deserve 5 stars!",

    "text": "I've visited Tutti Santi several times over the past few years, last time at the now-defunct Glendale location about 3 years ago, and the food and service were consistently fantastic.  It was based on those experiences that for my birthday, I selected Tutti Santi - Phoenix for my husband and adult son and I to visit (we almost went to Sassi in North Scottsdale, but were worried about the PGA crowd).  But Tutti Santi has never disappointed...until tonight.  Don't get me wrong, the food was still very good - except that the food we wanted wasn't available (why list Gnocchi on the menu if you're not going to have it?). Given that, I selected the Ravioli, my husband selected the Fetticcini (sp) and Shimp, and my son selected the Tortellini - all very good, except the shrimp had the tails not detached, a personal preference thing. Warm bread was very good, and we shared a dessert of Cheesecake which was delicious.  Wines were all very good, and we had by the glass wine, very nice selection.  The service, however sunk it.  The waiter came over, seemed rushed, and asked if we wanted something to drink, pretty much as we were just handed the menus, we were looking at the wine list at the time.  My husband and I quickly selected a glass each, and the waiter took away the menu before my son could select one (he ultimately ordered the Malbec - wonderful selection).  The waiter, who never did introduce himself, shared with us the specials (Cippino and a Chicken Marsala/Sausage dish), took our order for one Fetticcini dish and two Gnocchi dishes.  He came back to let us know that they were out of Gnocchi (at 6pm?  Was there a rush at lunch for plates of Gnocchi?), then when I asked about the chicken special, he corrected himself and said it was a veal special.  He also had a very difficult time remembering if we had one salad and two soups, or one soup and two salads, but he did bring it out correctly.  Meals came out well-timed....and that was the end of the service.  We had to wait 20 minutes after we had completed our menus to have our plates cleared, another few minutes for the waiter to come back and ask about dessert, and then another 15-20 minutes to get our single slide of cheesecake.  Then another 20 minutes to get the check, which was an interesting experience, as the waiter told us he was doing better because he had taken a 'shot' (of what, we wondered?  Medicine? Booze?  Heroin?  what? TMI) as he dropped off the check.  For not too much more money (we spent $100 for the three of us), we could have eaten in many different places and received great service as well as great food.    My recommendation - if you don't care about the service, but like good Italian food, try Tutti Santi.  I would avoid this restaurant at all cost for any special occasions - which is sad because it didn't used to be that way.",

They were booked solid,  but the hostess said if we waited 30 minutes in the bar,  she would seat us.  This was fine. We finally got our seats and waited about 15 minutes for our server John to show up for the first time.  He took our drink and appetizer order and left for about 15 more minutes. A younger table runner did come by frequently and fill our water glasses and bring us some VERY burnt garlic bread.  It was black. By this time we were getting pretty thirsty for those drinks and a little upset.  John finally came back with 2 salads,  but not our drinks.  We kept seeing him just standing over by the hostess station,  which was even more frustrating.  The tables next to us had a great server- a tall older gentleman that seemed very attentive and constantly returned to his tables. Our table decor was dusty- a cheesy fake candle that hadn't been dusted in perhaps years.  Finally I recieved my glasses of wine and our food.  I got the tortellini panna rosa. It was NOT good.  There was a foul smell to it that we couldn't put our finger on.  My boyfriend got the gnocchi. He's had it before,  and he said the quality had definitely dropped.  I couldn't finish mine,  so we flagged down John for our check and informed him that we needed to leave to get to a show we had tickets for.  He left and NEVER returned to our table!  We kept attempting to flag him down. But he continued to hover near the hostess station and stare at the wall.  We finally got so upset that we went up there and asked the hostess our waiters name- and if she could get him to give us our check. John came out and tossed it in front of us- NO APOLOGY for forgetting about us or anything- he just walked away!  My boyfriend has NEVER left a zero tip before,  but we had to.  He was incredibly rude and our visit was an incredible disappointment.  I love Italian,  but there's much better options out there than this. Get rid of John- he does not like his job.",

Also the bread that comes with it was pre buttered and had chunks of chopped up garlic on it. Omg we were in love with it. (Not for people who aren't a big garlic fan because it was loaded with it). You got your choice of soup or salad with the entree. I got a salad which was nice it was pretty dressed with balsamic. Simple salad no veggies on it but still good. My aunt got the soup and said it tastes like one they have at Olive Garden but way way better. Amazing meal for a really good price!",

But, someone needs to get in there with a high powered vacuum and get the caked on dirt off the heavy curtains hung around the dining room. Yuck!  On arrival I mentioned that I'd dined at the other Valley location. I was told they were both family run. But, separately. And, that this location was the original and \"the best.\" Bravo for the confidence of the hostess - perhaps she is family.  Well, I kind of remember having a really good experience at the north Phoenix location which is what brought me here. But, that was years ago with friends and I was probably paying more attention to friends than the meal at that time.  Here, we arrived late. Play off baseball was on the TV in the bar. So, too, were all the staff. The server was polite and friendly. But, more interested in the game. Service in the near empty dining room was slower than made sense.  The pollo caprese was not worth a to-go box for the 50% left uneaten. The lasagna bolognese wasn't impressive though acceptable in quantity for the price.  Willing to give the other location another try. This one is a no-go for me.",

Sure enough walked in and it was a busy family style Italian restaurant.  I sat in he bar and got Italian bread and fresh  parmesan  immediately, that's called a real good start.  The friendly bartender got a perfecto dirty martini poured in short order, not too dirty, super cold and generous size, and we were off.  The decor classic cheesy Italian, godfather pics, stars with autographs, Christopher Walken... the salad was delicious super fresh with a light but really flavorful balsamic and olive oil.  Not sure I've ever had that good a salad dressing!   Certain styles of food you just to have to try to get a measure of a place, for me it's linguini and clams.  Tutti Santi Nailed it of course, great flavor, healthy serving of clams, and when u get to the bottom, the absolutely heavenly olive oil butter sauce to soak up with the last bits of bread...wow!  This is food, a family run fresh local place that u would never know is there!!!",

We  stayed at Point Hilton Squaw Peak and wanted desperately  to eat off the Hotel Property and saw Tutti Santi tucked into a small corner nearby.   Everything was amazing! Great ambiance, Attentive Service, maybe too attentive but we were in the Small Room.  My Daughter ordered the homemade Ravioli.  Raviolis  tasted amazing the  sauce was rich and pleasurable! My Eggplant Parmesan made my taste buds dance and my other daughter had a pasta w artichokes mushrooms in a garlic cream, sauce little too garlicky for her and a little for me as well but she wouldn't ask for another dish so oh well..  Dessert  was a Tiramisu and a Spumoni Ice cream dipped in  hardened chocolate. They were both amazing..taste and in presentation. Our attentive and friendly waiter offered a sambuca shot after my meal as an aperitif I gladly  enjoyed :) Our bill was pricey but worth every penny. My daughter has proclaimed this is now Her FAVORITE restaurant. I am on board with this as well",

We were not disappointed. The meal started with warm garlic bread. The waiter built a rapport immediately. The drinks came promptly. Our food order was the house specialty of ravioli and a veal dish.  Both orders were exceptional. What topped off the experience was Trace, the waiter. He brought us sambuka the was lit on fire with three espresso beans in it. He directed us to drink the shot he while leaving one bean in the glass. He explained that one bean was for the present, one for the future and one for the past. You are to leave the past in the glass. The Rocket was successful but I was unable to leave the past behind me. We finished with tiramisu, coffee and espresso.

Met up with a co-workers father-in-law who happened to be in town and he suggested Tutti Santi, which he had visited on previous trips.  Had it not been for that recommendation, I don't know that I ever would have found this place.  They were quite busy that night due to a special promotion and it seemed that they were not quite used to it.  It took quite some time to place our order.  We ordered a bottle of wine for the table and I ordered a salad and gnocchi.  We started sipping the wine while waiting for our appetizers.  The salad was decent and the bread they brought for the table was actually very good.  However, due to the slow service, our wine bottle was empty long before the food came.  When the food arrived, we ordered another bottle of wine and began eating.  The gnocchi was very good, and everyone else seemed to enjoy their order as well. Unfortunately, our second bottle of wine never arrived.  When we mentioned it, the waiter apologized, but that was it.  This would have been an easy four star review but the sub-par service killed it for me. They may have been busy, but 15 minutes for drinks and 30 minutes for salads is still pushing it.",

Its in the corner of another strip mall.  Inside it is very quaint, lots of candles, dimly lit and inviting.  The service has always been superb and even the price is not bad.  It seems as almost everything they serve is homemade with the best ingredients.  They make the creamiest raviolis that absolutely melt in your mouth.  The ravioli sauce is light and very flavorful.  I also love the lasagna.  The meat, the sauce, the noodles, spice, and size are simply perfection.  All of the soups I have had have also been quite delicious.  The one item I would not recommend is the leg of lamb.  I was not impressed with the flavor, or the price and I would not order it again.    If you are in the mood for great homemade Italian and remotely near any of the Tutti Santis locations definitely give it a try.",

It was SO- SOOO worth it. I am NOT a big italian fan... or so I thought.  My husband had the ravioli, and with every bite he would tell me how incredible it was. :) I went with the salmon and veggies. WOW!! The lemon butter sauce was devine! I rarely am a member of the clean plate club, but I seriously found myself wanted to lick the plate clean. (don't worry I did contain myself)  So I have to say... I thought I was not an italian fan. Apparently I just haven't been lucky enough to find some GREAT italian food.  2 thumbs WAY UP!! Warning.. it is a little on the pricey side. The ambience is very nice and it is worth it.",

The waiter was cocky and screwed up our order too...Overall we were very disappointed.",

The servers are lovely and attentive, and sort of distract you from the distinctly geriatric feel in the place.  My husband and I felt like the youngest people in the restaurant by at least 40 years.  I have no idea where this best ravioli nomination came from - they are abysmally forgettable.  I am hard-pressed to believe that a better ravioli cannot be found in Phoenix - there are just way too many good culinary adventures in the area to consider these bland, oversauced pillows of flavorless ricotta worth ordering.    Unimpressed by everything, we were bowled over by the bill.  How could a meal so forgettable come out to $150 for the two of us?  Was the wine that expensive? No.  Did we order anything extraordinary? No. Are we going back? You already know the answer...",

It may have been the wine, it may have been the euphoria of having real Italian food, I don't know, but the conversation was so wonderful, the ambiance was great, and the service was all I could have asked for. I have never had \"authentic Italian food\" (my only experience was the Olive Garden) and now I know what I was missing. The food was so delicate and quaint, yet full of flavor. I upgraded my penne pasta for the infamous gnocchi, and am so glad I did. The Chicken della Casa was wonderful and I have enough left over for lunch tomorrow! My friend had the lasagna, and it was nothing like any type of lasagna I've ever had in the past. There was more than enough food but I didn't walk out of there feeling weighed down, instead we enjoyed several courses over a period of 2 hours and I felt like I truly could have been in Italy.",

I had the ravioli, which was not what I intended on having, but I'm glad I did.  I normally steer clear of anything with ricotta cheese but decided to go for it.  The ravioli was homemade with ricotta cheese and spinach.  It had a mixture of white and red sauce and was delicious.  The sauce was just enough to cover the ravioli but not over-bearing.  The hubs had the chicken florentine and it was also very good. I'm not exactly sure what kind of sauce it had but it tasted like a wine sauce of sorts.  It came with two decent sized chicken breasts covered in spinach and topped with sauce with a side of penne pasta that had what I assume was a tomato-type sauce.  Very good!  They provide you with a basket full of delicious and plentiful garlic bread.  The service was great and the atmosphere was very nice.  It's located in the corner of a strip mall.  We wore jeans with nice shirts, I saw some people in shorts and others were dressed pretty nice...dresses, collared shirts, etc.  If you're looking for good, authentic Italian food, this is the place!!",

I think it was because they did not seem to want our large party if 11, that on multiple times they let us know was an inconvenience (the restaurant was only 1/3 full), and when our napkins were mildew smellingand we politely asked for new ones, they treated us like we were rude, smelling the napkin and saying the entire bag came back from the laundry like this (hello, why would you out them on thetable then!) We also asked for new glasses because the store the napkins in the glasses. It was just horrible after that. The bread I was excited about was cold, wrong meals and drinks were brought with no apology. There was a good 30 minutes we saw noone, and we went through 4 different waiters.  They over charged the gratuity and when we showed them the math they denied it only after asking for the manager they wrote in a new price. I will never go back. Even after all that we were standing out front at the benches saying our goodbyes when 2 different waiters came out and walked around the group. They seemed like they were trying to get us leave but I can't be positive.",

It was actually Yelp that guided me to this restaurant. We went for New Year's Eve and had their Special NYE menu.   Ambiance: romantic, dimly lit with balloons EVERYWHERE! The waitstaff and the customers were getting tangled in the balloons, but it was fun. If you wait in the lobby for a while, you will see tons of celebrity photos of those that have been here including Jennifer Lopez, the Diamondback Coach, Charles Barkley and more.   Customer Service: was good, but we went during their shift change, so they almost forgot our eggplant appetizer and didn't ask my husband how he wanted his steak (rare, med, etc). We would have just skipped it and just eat the main course, but the new waiter asked about it and apologized and gave the appetizer to us free of charge and made sure my husband's steak was rare. His efforts helped and we are so glad he brought it out because it was so very good.   Food: garlic bread was dry, minestrone was fabulous, dressing on salad was tasty too. The Eggplant with ricotta and spinach appetizer was to die for. Veal Scaloppine was tender and the Steak was juicy.   We will definitely visit again.",

    "text": "Wow!!  This is amazing... my new favorite place.    I went with my mom, brother and his wife to celebrate my sister-in-law's birthday.  My mom had been raving about the ravioli and she was right - they are amazing!!   I had looked at the menu and was torn between ordering the homemade ravioli (cheese & spinach filling) with a cream/tomato sauce or the homemade gnocchi with the same cream/tomato sauce.  So, I convinced the table to order the gnocchi appetizer (a small version of the gnocchi dinner).  It was amazing!!!  The best gnocchi I've ever had.  Really light and melts in your mouth.  And the cream and tomato sauce is really fresh and creamy at the same time.  The garlic bread that comes with the dinners is good - even better dipped in olive oil and balsamic (which they will bring you if you ask).  The dinners all come with either soup or salad.  I had read on Yelp that the soups were really good.  So, my mom and I got their soup of the day - a cream of vegetable soup - cauliflower, brocolli, carrots, potato.....  Really, creamy and flavorful and light - it was amazing!!!!  My brother and his wife both got the salads.  They both ate them but said they were just so-so.  Nothing special.  They should have gotten the soup!  Then, we all ordered the ravioli except for my brother who must have loved the gnocchi as much as I did and he got that.  We were all suprised he didn't go for a meat dish - he's usually a pretty big eater.    The ravioli were just like the gnocchi - light and just perfect - in a cream and tomato sauce.    For dessert, my sister-in-law picked the creme brulee.  It was a good size, with sliced strawberries on top.  Our waiter brought it out with a candle on top and it ended up being free (nice touch from the restaurant).  It was very good.   And the little shots of flaming sambuca (black licorice flavored liquor) at the end is a nice and fun touch, too.  The service was excellent as well.    The atmosphere is fine - very cozy, dim lighting and traditional with white table cloths, etc.  The decor is a pretty outdated but I've seen worse.  It wouldn't deter me from coming back.  But, I would probably go even more if it was updated.  I'm so excited to have found it - my new favorite Italian place - and really reasonable prices, too.",

The tender Lasagna topped with a mozzarella so perfect words cannot describe could easily be called the crown jewel of this restaurant. The spinach stuffed ravioli was second to none.

It was served with linguini in a red sauce that had a slight kick. Pasta was perfectly prepared. My husband had the orange roughy which was in lemon caper sauce and was delicious, neither of us had eaten roughy before and we were pleasantly surprised. The desserts were traditional Italian desserts, so we decided to share a canoli, which was a great choice. The shell was crisp rather than soggy as some cannoli's can be. The filling had a hint of sambuca flavor. The only thing missing were the chocolate chips. Delicious meal and very attentive service, we would definitely go back. I would recommend calling for reservations as it is not too big a place and fills up quickly.",

    "text": "I have been to this tutti santi numerous times over the past 5 years. Last night we decided it was time to indulge once more.   We ordered the gnocchi as well as the daily special, lobster ravioli. I normally scarf a plate of gnocchi as they are handmade and delicious. Needless to say, I was scared to venture out my box.  The gnocchi were divine as usual...handmade daily, with the perfect mix of white sauce and bolognese. The lobster ravioli were delicious. Also, freshly made topped with an awesome vodka sauce. Furthermore, the lobster was so fresh, as if it was still swimming in the ocean.  To put the finishing touch on our wonderful dinner experience, our server brought over the signature shots of flaming sambuca, including the \"three flies\" (as they are called), symbolizing the past, present and future...If I had to predict the near future, I would say that we will be back soon.  Finally, our server was awesome and friendly. After all, you can't have a perfect dinner with shitty service.",

Which to me makes a restaurant with great food go from good to great.    I ate the lamb shank- Angello Dorato, which fell off the bone and was delicious. I cleaned the plate.   Dad had the veal marsala with fettuccine alfredo.  The veal was fantastic and the alfredo was just right. The sauce was not too thick-not to thin.  Dad cleaned the plate.  From him being in the food industry for 30+years and eating in many italian establishments both here and Chicago, believe me that says more than alot.     Mom had the special of the night, which was a cioppino with tons of seafood.  When most italian restaurants serve this dish at least one of the seafood items will be rubbery or fishy tasting (not in a good way) especially the mussels.  Not here. Everything was the way it should be. I felt this was the plate of the evening out of 3 great dishes.   Mom didn't clean the plate, she has a small stomach.  But I will be eating the leftovers in about two hours after I sleep off my meal.  Everything from the bread, the calamari fritti, to the tiramisu was fabulous.  I'm glad we couldn't get reservations anywhere else for this special meal.    Gratzi and Buon Natale.  Oh yeah, I didn't get the raviolis this time, but if you've haven't had them it's a must try.",

Though the restaurant itself is relatively small in terms of physical space, it's enormous in terms of friendly, efficient servers. Tutti Santi produces probably the finest Italian cuisine in the Valley...quite probably in the entire region.        I sampled the nightly special on that special night..a veal cannelloni. It was a revelation compared to the numerous other fine Italian restaurants in the Valley. It's obvious that the food quality and preparation are the main focus here and the execution is wonderfully successful.         Love-of-my-life had a scrumptious Chicken Marsala and declared it equal to that of that presented at the Ristorante La Pergola in Rome...the three Michelin Star gastronomic heaven we were privileged to dine at while visiting Roma last fall.          Kudos to the kitchen staff from the Chef on down...because they have much to be proud of.          This place is definitively on the 'keepers' list.",

It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory but still maintained the freshness of the tomato flavor.  I always get the lasagne anytime I try a new restaurant. I liked their lasagne but i felt the noodles were too soft giving off a mushy texture. Otherwise, very good.  Loved the ambiance and make sure you check out the pictures in the entrance way. And the gentleman who's either the owner or manager to do the lighter thing to one of the pics. You will die laughing and leave with a huge smile on your face.   Two thumbs up. I will be back!",

If you're going to use technology like OpenTable or even take reservations the analog way, you should expect to honor those first like any normal restaurant. Just put in a policy that if you don't check-in 5 minutes after your reservation time your table will be released....simple.

Even in the parking lot we could smell the luscious garlic smell radiating from the building. We were seated right away and ordered a bottle of chianti that was to die for! Next came the garlic bread, must have been what we smelt from outside since it was covered in real garlic pieces. We each ordered something different and were each impressed by our food. My gnocchi melted in my mouth and may have been better than my last trip to Italy. My husband ordered the special which was a variety of seafood tossed with pasta sand served in the pan it was cooked in; every part was cooked perfectly, not a chewy piece to be found. Even the veal parmigiana was tender and portioned just right.   To finish, we will return next week while we are here and hopefully every year we come back. Hopefully next week we get to meet the notorious \"mama\" who started this delightful eatery.",

The servers seem to know all of them, running over to their tables and giving them hugs and kisses. The two male servers are too much.   This place is a racist unprofessional joke. We left the restaurant peacefully, kept my mouth shut as to not create a scene and the waiter came chasing after us. Seriously Guido?! Back off! Unprofessional.   Will not be back. Food is not good and doesn't make up for the horrid behavior of the staff.",

It was close to 9 p.m.when I arrived be myself to a quiet restaurant. I decided to eat at the bar since the dining room was nearly empty at this time. I was greeted by Robby, the extremely friendly bar tender, who welcomed me, shook my hand and asked for my name, which he addressed me by for the rest of the evening.  I found out through the course of dinner that Robby's family owned the restaurant (one of two in Phoenix).  His family is first generation Italian (although Robby sounds straight out of N.Y. but he says he's never even been), and recipes are family recipes with some ingredients his mom won't even reveal to him.  I ordered the special, shrimp parm, which included a house salad with homemade Italian dressing - delicious. The shrimp parm was a nice portion of large butterflied shrimp, lightly breaded and topped with melted parm, and a side of spaghetti with marinara. Cooked to perfection.  The food was delicious, but what l enjoyed the most was Robby's humor, and the way he made a lone diner feel comfortable and at home. I will be back the next time I'm in the area. Thanks Rob!",

The decor is probably 20-30 years old, which has its own charms and is passable for a traditional Italian restaurant.   The biggest issue was our waiter Andreas, who looks like Ron Jeremy. He wouldn't take our order without making us ask four times as some sort of poor joke. Then he was shouting across the dining room to check that he had our order correct \"did you want the white wine sauce or the marinara?\" He would toss silverware on the table in passing and remark \"everything okay?\" Without waiting for a response or caring. I didn't want to ask for things that we needed for fear of him antagonizing us further.   The second big issue: the food. We started with the mussles in white wine sauce, they were okay. The salad was super plain, one tomato slice, in store bought balsamic dressing. Not even worth eating. I got the penne pasta and it arrived with chunks of wilted romaine lettuce on it. My boyfriend got the veal in Marsala sauce that was flavorless boiled fatty veal.   We each got a glass of wine which was good, on the warm side. Getting a bill for $90 for this extremely sub standard service and food was the final insult to this awful experience.   If you're looking for good Italian food I recommend Tomasos or North.",

    "text": "I had dinner at Tutti Santi on July 31, 2015, it was a memorable experience.    First off, this place only serves dinner and if you're interested in a reservation do it online because you'll be lucky to get a return call if you leave a message.  When you arrive, don't expect flattering service.  I suspect Tutti Santi relies on it's regulars because the servers don't go out of their way to make you feel welcome.  They're not exactly rude either, but I saw other tables who were almost ignored until they got up and asked for service.  Speaking of what I saw at other tables... (YOU GOTTA READ THIS) I was watching the server who was working at neighboring table with a birthday cake and noticed something hanging from his face.  \"Huh\" I thought, \"I wonder what this is...\" So I watched closer.  I saw it again and suspected something gross.  On the third sighting I confirmed my worst suspicions, the server had a long watery snot hanging from his nose.  Yes, no joke!  As the server walked away from the table he wiped the snot away from his face with his bare hand, then wiped his hand on his apron. GROSS!  Seriously, I didn't know whether to laugh or vomit, so I laughed.  If you can tolerate the mediocre service, and the potential for snot in or near your food, then I encourage you to try the cioppino, it was great!  Served piping hot it came with plenty of mussels, oysters, shrimp, fish, and I think there may have been some lobster in there too, all in a delicious slightly spicy broth.  The tiramisu was good too, and our server (not the one with snot hanging from his nose) says it was made in house.  On the negative side, the salad was very plain and sloppily served.  Plus, they serve romaine lettuce which I don't care for.    Thanks for the memories Tutti Santi!",

Took several minutes to get someone to take our drink order. It was like our waiter couldn't see us. He walked past us no less than 6 times while we were trying to flag him down. We finally resorted to raising our hands like a bunch of kindergarteners. He still ignored us. If not for the hostess, all would have been lost. An entirely different waiter took our food order than who'd taken our appetizer order. It took 20 minutes to get our salads. Another 30 to get our entrees. Now we're 1 hour 20 minutes into dinner service.  2) food was delicious and we enjoyed it, despite the service... until a roach crawled across our table right in the middle of dinner. The Hostess saw the whole thing. Watched us hunt it down and kill it. She apologized and gave the excuse that it's Phoenix in the summer time. They crawl right under the door Sorry about that. My thing is this--if you know it's a problem, why aren't you taking measures to fix it? A little weather stripping under the door, maybe?  Anyway, no manager came and tried to make it right. No one but the hostess apologized (at this point). Our waiter was in the wind. The waiter who took our food order brought us our bill. Over $300. No compensations for the roach crawling across our table. Have a nice night. The friend we were with (who actually suggested the place to my husband) had to go ask for the manager who took  $60 off the bill and gave our party a shot of Zambuka. By this point, too little too late. I'll never come back here, honestly, I'd rather eat at Olive Garden (that should tell you something). The ONLY reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because the actual food was great. Everything else was terrible.",

Also our Penne Pasta  that came with the fish was a little too aldente, and the free Garlic Bread had way to much raw garlic!! Service was ok but had to ask for water refills and our dirty plates sat on the table...not what you expect for a high end restaurant. With that said over all very friendly hostess got us right in without a reservation (which she did recommend for next time).  I would recommend this restaurant. The atmosphere is more for a special night out. A little pricey for just an everyday dinner.This is the kind of place to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries!",

There was a group of 8 and the restaurant was very accommodating in terms of seating. In general, the food was a 4 star. Great flavors, great pasta, and deliciousness overall! Since there were 8 of us, I was able to get a little taste of everything. I would highly recommend getting one of the veal pasta entrees. The meat was cut and cooked perfectly. My sister ordered a gnocchi and this was seriously the best I've ever had! It was so buttery and just melts on your mouth.   I'm knocking down 1 star because of service. Our server obviously liked the table next to us more because 1) he offered fresh pepper to the other group when he served them salad and soup but he didn't do so for us - mind that this was minutes apart 2) he didn't offer fresh pepper again when he brought out the dinner so we had to ask him for some, and 3) he only focused on serving the other table because they ordered a bottle of wine so he thought he was going to get better tips. He didn't take away our dirty appetizer plates so we had a bunch of small plates at the end of the table piling up.   From this experience, I would go back for food but if I had the same server a again I would leave.",

I would recommend wearing more than a t shirt but nothing too crazy.   Atmosphere was slightly older and they have an enclosed somewhat patio area.   Overall the food was really good authentic Italian food. Salad was simple, lightly dressed, and the dressing was really good.  Pasta dishes were well cooked, al dente. Everyone who had the ravioli really enjoyed it.   Our server was very nice, really did a good job talking up the food and making recommendations.   It did take a little long to get the check as the restaurant filled up by the time we were done. Other than that a great overall experience.   We would go back if ever in the area again.",

I had the chefs special with the seafood, a combination of many different seafoods. It was amazing. The rest of our party had the veal and loved it. The tiramisu was wonderful and they threw in a shot on the house with every desert ordered. The staff were so friendly and very personable. The Wine was great!

I am from New York and I am picky about my Italian food. Heading into the restaurant I already knew I wanted to order the linguine with white clam sauce and the half gnocchi half ravioli dinner plate. This was the best ravioli I have ever had, it's creamy and delicious. I have been thinking about it since I left and craving it so I know I will be back. The server was very entertaining and attentive. And we got two free shots of sambuca at the end of the night. I highly recommend anyone to go try their ravioli!!!",

We were there with a very large group Saturday night and they had the good sense to give us Trace who was a fabulous server, totally rolled with our nonsense and was just a hoot in general.    My food was phenomenal - I had the ravioli with spinach and ricotta.  Let me tell you folks - this is the REAL DEAL.  I usually avoid Italian restaurants because box pasta is so easy to make at home... this is not box pasta.  It is homemade and the raviolis were light, delicate and practically melted in my mouth.  The garlic bread was uber-garlicky, buttery and sinful.  (I guarantee you this restaurant is free of vampires.)    We had brought in a birthday cake and I happened to notice that the person who made cake brought in paper plates.  In a classy-as-fuck move, Trace had already brought out plates and forks and insisted that we use those instead.    I rarely say this about Italian joints but I would really like to come here again.  Thank you Tutti Santi for such a wonderful experience and give our man Trace a raise - he deserves it after dealing with us.  :)",

    "text": "From the pastoral wall mural and the wine bottles lining the shelves to the vintage ad posters, Tutti Santi is exactly what you envision when you think EYE-TAL-YON. And by that, I mean the decor is a little cliched.  What isn't cliched are the authentic homemade pastas and attentive service.  Without a reservation, we were greeted and sat immediately on a Saturday night. The server told us a bit about the place and seemed near bursting with pride as he described the house specialties. I almost expected him to bring his fingers to his mouth and make an exaggerated smacking kiss. He didn't, but that would have been awesome.  We started out with salad greens and cream of asparagus soup, both were simple and flavorful. The gnocchi and ricotta spinach ravioli that everyone on here is raving about? The best I've ever had. We couldn't decide between the two, so our server offered to do half and half- brilliant.  We also had the special of the night, Veal Oscar (veal cutlets in a Marsala sauce topped with fontina, asparagus, and crab meat), with a side of penne pomodoro. The pasta outshined the veal for me, but I thoroughly enjoyed both dishes. The portions are on the generous side and left us unable to even contemplate dessert- still we left with enough leftovers for an entire meal.  I'm not sure when I'll be back, it's a bit pricey for a casual dinner (for my pocketbook), and the ambiance was a little too lacking to make it a special \"date night\" spot. I do know I'm going to be thinking about those ravioli for a long time, though.",

I also thoroughly enjoyed the authentic, NY style Cannoli. Incredible casing and filling like my days in growing up in New York. The food was a very solid 4.5 stars. What took my rating to 5 stars was the customer engagement and service. My server was Vincent. What an interesting, engaging, and warm human being. He sat down like a friend and we shared stories about New York, kids, movies, and food. He was like a friend who happen to be serving me a delicious meal. He also shared two shots of Sambucca with me to finish a great meal. He was  supported by excellent teammates like Andreas, another very genuine and wonderful guy. Just a phenomenal overall experience! Thumbs up and may you be lucky enough to enjoy the service of Vincent and Andreas during your meal! :-)",

We liked it so much we went back the next night!!",

Amazing service started with a phone call around noon asking if they served \"gluten free pasta\" as this was the closest Italian place to our Hotel while we were visiting. The owner, Roberto, answered and said \"No, but I can go out and buy you some for dinner tonight - what time will you be coming in\". I thought - wow, this is a random person calling and the owner, who doesn't even know if I'll really show up, is going to go buy me special pasta. So that's what happened. We came in at 8:00pm and all of the staff was waiting for our arrival, greeted us by name and Roberto had the special GF pasta waiting for me. The dish I ordered was the special that came with all sorts of seafood and a red tomato sauce - it was OUT OF THIS WORLD delicious! The food is awesome, the staff is super and Roberto is GREAT! I will return here when visiting Phoenix again.",

Vincent was his name and he was quite the gentleman, quite the character, and quite the  waiter. Our food was fantastic. We tried everything from escargot to a couple of desserts. None of it disappointed. Given it's location in a strip mall, you would never expect to find a gem like this. It is one of the top rated Italian restaurants  in Phoenix and one taste you will see why. Make sure to try this place, you will not regret it!",

The owner Robby and his mother Nina are great people and go out of their way to make you feel at home at Tutti Santi's.  The food is incredible and rather inexpensive from my perspective.  The home made raviolis are made fresh each day and I often bring friends and family in just to try them.  Everyone agrees that the Ravioli's are the best they have ever had anywhere! The calamari, mussels, and escargot are also very good appetizers.  My favorite entree is the tortellini panna rosa which is amazing.  If you are looking for authentic Italian food and not some olive garden frozen Italian, you have to try Tutti Santi's.   Their wine list is very good also and if you have room for desert try the cannoli's.",

I had the Chicken Al Momento , with salad and a cup of cream of  mushroom soup .  The salad was a balsamic vinigerette and it was pretty lame. It only came with one small tomato slice and no onions or pepperincinis like you get at many Italian Restaurants. The soup was ok and the Chicken Al Momento was ok , but it was served on a very small bed of spaghetti , I mean a box of pasta is about a buck and a half , put some more on the plate. The menu at this Phoenix location was very limited and being from Chicago I had higher expectations.",

Robbie, the owner, was very welcoming, and I no longer felt uncomfortable eating a \"real dinner\" alone.  I want to thank Andreas for the suggestion the ravioli, and I would like to thank him, Robbie, and the other staff members for making me feel like a family member.

The waiter was entertaining as a comedian but wasting time and service for our meals were slow. Orange Fillet piccata was a great white flaky fish. Chicken piccata also was pounded out and tasty. Chicken Parmesan did not seem fresh and was not so desirable.  The sides of pasta were skimpy and tasteless. Sauces flavorless. Over all it was satisfying but less than stellar. A bit of a hit and miss with the dishes and the clowning waiter. Overall we made the most of it and had a good time.",

We made reservations in advance but the restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived at 5:15 on a Saturday night so if you dine early reservations probably aren't super vital.  Our server was very nice and gave us info on the specials of the day and appetizer recommendations.  We had the calamari and antipasti appetizers which were both ok.  Calamari was a bit rubbery but it had good flavor.  I had spaghetti bolognese for my entree and it was very good.  My husband had the gnocchi.  I tasted his but I like the bolognese sauce better than the sauce on the gnocchi.  I also had creme brulee for dessert and I like that it came topped with diced strawberries.  Over all, prices were quite a bit higher than we normally spend for a dinner out so this is definitely more of a special occasion type place, but my husband did order 3 drinks, which was 25% of our bill.  Food was great, service was great.  We will eat here again.",

Very accommodating but I felt a bit rushed.   We wanted a casual meal, but he wanted us to order.   We finally told him to come back in X minutes, and we'd be ready.  I ordered a glass of one of their cabs.   Very good choice, I must say.   He ordered his customary white.   Sorry.   I don't remember the vineyards of either one.     He loves eggplant parmigiana, which he ordered.  I love and ordered fettuccine with shrimp.  YUMMMM!   Is all I have to say about my dish.  I think it is the bet I've had.   The flavors and the textures were perfect.  Definitely could not be beat.  One of my friends/clients, who is also Sicilian, works at their Scottsdale location.  She and Debbie are best friends.   One of my neighbors opened the restaurant (as a customer) almost 20 years ago, and has continued as a loyal follower ever since.   Roberto, the owner, was most friendly.   It is like a neighborhood watering hole in a more upscale sort of way.     The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because of the server, although Michael did grow on me.   I know he was trying his best and has maybe a spastic sort of personality.   I know my guy pal didn't mind his personality.   So I guess I could give it 4.5 stars.  I would LOVE to go again.",

She was a member of the family who owns the restaurant, so we was very knowledgeable and passionate. When I ordered the Orange Roughy, she assured me I would love it and she was right. As she predicted, it was \"like butter.\" She also took the time to describe to my dinner partner how the lasagna was made, which made it sound delicious...and it was!!  When it came to dessert, I thought it was great that she let us know which ones were homemade. I settled on the Mocha Mascarpone Cheesecake. It was amazing!! It is now on my top 5 dessert list. I will be thinking about it until next time. Can't wait!!",

We bow down to Jimmy (server), Chris (magician...yes, AMAZING close-up magic, table-side!) and Roberto (owner). These gentlemen are second to none and truly brought the experience over the top. And for the record, the atmosphere is so, so romantic, yet, I was able to enjoy this meal with my husband and 3 kids, including a baby and didn't feel out of place, whatsoever.

I had a frisson when they seemed surprised I was willing to sit with my back to the door in this old-school Italian place that had kind of New York vibe to it. Once we worked through that and settled into a nice glass of Chianti we were off and running.  Nice traditional (Southern) Italian menu including items like stuffed mushrooms, carpaccio, and tomato/mozzarella for starters as well as old standby's like lasagna, linguine with clams, and veal parmigiana for the mains.  On top of the menu (which is more diverse than I'm describing) they offered nice specials as well.  I had the carpaccio of beef (very good) followed by the veal parmigiana (outstanding).  The entree came with garlic bread (fresh and very good) and a side salad (less fresh and not as good).    The ambiance is fun, casual, and a bit noisy if you're in the small, low-ceiling room next to the entrance on the right.    They finished me off with a free sambuca with coffee beans in it, one representing the past, present, and future.  (Along with special instructions to leave the past behind.)  While the food was perfectly good, I knocked it up a full rating point for the attentive, friendly, and warm service.",

    "text": "First, I'm a tough reviewer.  A five or even four star review is not common.    The restaurant is nothing to write home about from the outside.  Very dated entrance and setting.  It's a bit like stepping back 30 years to a local Italian eatery.  Service was very good.  All staff were efficient, friendly, courteous.    Food was good.  Not exceptional, but solidly good.    Wife started with the soup of the day, which was okay.  I had the house salad, which was okay.  Nothing special so far.  I liked the basket of bread, my wife thought it wasn't very good.  Had the muscles in a white wine sauce as an appetizer.  It was very tasty.  The sauce was exceptional.  But relatively small portion, and relatively high priced.  The calamari, as you would expect in a higher priced Italian restaurant, was very good.  Lightly breaded, perfectly cooked, it was tender and tasty.  Decent portion.  I would definitely order this again.  For dinner, my wife had some variation of veal scallopine.  My wife thought it was tasty, but the portions were very very small for a $24 entree.  Sauce was good... a common theme here.  I had their seafood pasta ($25).  It was a medium sized bowl of pasta, didn't taste fresh (boiled dried), with a good red sauce and a fair portion of good seafood.  My wife had the cheesecake for desert.  Very thin little piece, nothing fancy.  All in all, we felt that the food was good.  Service was excellent.  Setting was fair... a very dated but still nice setting.    What we had a harder time with were the prices.  We just felt that everything was about 30% more expensive than it deserved to be.  They obviously don't spend much on the restaurant setting.  So I don't see how they can justify it.  If I had paid $16-17 for my bowl of pasta, then it would have been fair.  But not $25.  Not for the portions or the ingredient cost.  Perhaps that is why they were near dead empty on a Sunday night (not a busy restaurant night, I know, but still).  In other words... I enjoyed my food and time here, but not the check.  And so, as a whole, this place gets 3 out of 5 stars.   It's very likely I won't be back, but if someone else was treating me and wanted to take me there, I'm sure I would very much enjoy my meal.",

After 4 days of Southwestern fare (and I'm a fan) on a recent trip out here in AZ, I was really hankering for some flavors of home, and Tutti Santi just happened to be across the street from the Hilton that I was staying at. This is old school Italian just like we get back home...Dean & Frank playing in the background, some tasty chianti ready to be served up, red sauce with plenty of zing, and all the old menu favorites. Fried Calamari was light yet crispy, with plenty of crushed red pepper in the marinara, the potato leek soup divine, and the chioppino special was absolutely loaded with clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, calamari, and orange roughy, served in a large skillet with linguini and a white wine & tomato broth that did not skimp on the herbs and garlic. Honestly, I was in heaven and had no room for dessert. All the waiters were as old school as it gets (again, making me feel right at home) and extremely friendly and attentive. The place was quite busy (it was a Friday night) but there was no lag time on getting my food. Seeing as I come out to AZ for business fairly regularly, I will be back!",

We came as a party of 30 people and we had the place to ourselves for lunch since they are only opened for dinner.  They knew the owner that well.   Everything was great.  The owner is definitely a people person and was on top of things.  Even his staff was great.  We started with appetizers.  The ravioli was ok.  Think it was handmade.  I'm not a fan usually so just ok to me.  The calamari was good - pretty standard though.  I liked the mozzarella caprese b/c they had it with sauteed peppers and olives.  Bt those 3 and the bread, we had a meal right there. For the entree I had the Chicken Imperiale with Mixed Vegetables - chicken stuffed with fresh crab and shrimp topped with a light mushroom sauce.  This came recommended by the mom.  It was SO good!  The chicken with the crab and shrimp were done well but it was the mushroom sauce that had me.  It wasn't too thick or overwhelming.  So flavorful.  I could just eat that with the bread and I'd be happy.  I had leftovers and asked the server if I could have extra sauce.  He didn't think so since they make it fresh.  When he brought me back my food wrapped up, I found out that they had MADE me extra sauce and put it in my container.  BIG BONUS and BIG PLUS for them on customer service!!!  Oh I was a happy camper.  Hence why they get that 5th star.  Had cheesecake for dessert that they make fresh there.  Yum!  Simple.    I looked at their website and saw they have other locations with dif. menu.  It seems like all the others have the same menu where they do fresh pasta.  This location is the only that is different. Will have to try it somewhere else.",

My daughter had the gnocchi in a light cream sauce.  She loved it.  My husband had the spaghetti in bolognese sauce.  He said it was wonderful.  Of course portions were too huge!  I had the pasta and vegetables.  I ate the entire portion.  I can't believe I ate the entire portion!  At the end of the meal, the friendly and oh so helpful waiter brought my husband and I a complementary shot of lit Sambuca with three coffee beans.  The beans were to symbolize past, present and future.  My daughter had the chocolate cake and I had the creme brule for dessert.    We had a wonderful experience and the meal was great.",

    "text": "I've been told for a long time that Tutti Santi was a must-try for authentic Italian food in a romantic setting, and I finally got to try it.  The Phoenix spot on 16th St. (there are five locations) is indeed romantic, since the restaurant is darkly lit with candles on linen-covered tables, with Italian decorative touches in its paintings covering the walls. The restaurant is divided into three parts-a main dining room, a smaller private area and a small bar area. If you mention you're having a romantic evening, and the place isn't too busy, they might even put you in the smaller room all by yourself, which is thoughtful.  The service is top-notch. Not only was our server friendly and engaging and made us feel like his main focus, but all the other servers who came to our table were friendly and professional.  We started with the Mozzarella Caprese ($11.95), which had thick hunks of mozzarella and sliced basil atop thickly covered tomatoes, smothered in diced tomatoes. I've never had a caprese dish where diced tomatoes were on top, but I love tomatoes, so I definitely didn't mind! It also came with some spicy peppers and olives, and all the factors complemented each other well.  For my entree, I ordered the Homemade Ravioli alla Nina ($15.95), with ricotta cheese and spinach. I was able to get a combo of the tomato sauce and cheese sauce, and you could really tell the pasta was homemade. It was so delicate and almost melted in your mouth, and the sauces were amazing. I felt like the dish was a little too watery and would have preferred the pasta to have been thicker, but I'd rather have thin homemade pasta over pre-made stuff any day.  My pal got the special, the orange roughy, which looked and smelled amazing. I really wanted to try it even though I don't eat fish, but the aromas were enough to make me know it was a tasty dish-which he agreed on.  We of course had to try the tiramisu, my favorite dessert ever. There was so much mascarpone cream in the giant piece of dessert, and it was served very traditionally, covered in cocoa powder. The ladyfingers were soaked heavily, and the cream was amazing. It was a really, really good piece of tiramisu.  Besides the scrumptious food, I loved that Tutti Santi had something for everyone, whether you want a romantic date night, an evening out with a big group or just want to chill at the bar and talk with the bartender. No matter what you go there for, it feels warm and friendly.",

We will say the food was excellent, but our server, Trace, was poor at best. He was charming and personable to other tables, sharing stories about his recent Birthday celebrations. When my Boyfriend said he wanted water to start with, Trace actually rolled his eyes. He made us feel unwelcomed and uncomfortable.  all of our expectations from previous experiences fell far short of  this last visit.",

And I really liked the extra touch of a Sambuca after dessert.  And everyone there is family....very personable servers who seem to remember every client like they are old friends.  Is the restaurant a bit dated, is the salad a little boring....maybe.  But this isn't a chain, its a family owned/operated place, and you'll feel like family too by the time you leave.",

    "text": "Holy cow. This place has glorious tasting food and the service was very quirky and top notch.    My hubby and I went here for the first time to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  I was excited after reading all the reviews and went in knowing we \"had\" to try the gnocchi.  I've had gnocchi a few times in my life and it was ok...nothing to write home about.  We arrive and the place was cram packed, busy.  We had an open table reservation so we didn't have to wait.  We were seated in a little room, off the main dining room, that had a few tables in it.  It was nice to be off to the side in a more quiet area so my hubby and I could talk and feel more \"secluded\".    Our server was Trace and he was a hoot.  So dang quirky that it was totally odd at first.  I had never experienced server personalities that were were as if you were their buddy and in their house.  The first moment it started was when my hubby asked Trace about their beer selection.  Upon listing a good lineup of their beers my husband decided to hold off and not order one. Trace threw his hands up and said \"Damnit!\" as he went to grab our menus (after we ordered our meals). lol.  I was very confused and thought, \"that is pretty....unprofessional...\" I then began to think that I had remembered tons of yelpers raved about the service as well and figured this \"culture\" was so unique, like the food, that it just added to the greatness about this place.  Trace had come back into the room to care for a few more tables and I just really realized that was truly his server essence and I quickly fell in love with it.  He kept all of his customers smiling and laughing.  He was a total kid when it came to his customers.  He cracked semi-sarcastic jokes about my husband to me and vice versa.  Nothing brash...it as all in great taste.  He was awesome.  The same can be said about the bartender.  He was sent over to give a more extensive list of beers that they offered that Trace wasn't/coulnd't rattle off automatically.  Even the bartender as totally quirky and I really realized from then on that THAT'S just how it is there.  It feels like FAMILY in there.  Got the gnocchi app and holy friggen cow.  Everyone is/was RIGHT.  Uh-may-zing! Their garlic bread was good.  Great balance of butter and garlic on it.  I got the split pea soup and my husband the garden salad.  The soup I liked and my husband thought the garden salad was \"ok\".    For the main courses, I ordered the orange roughy w/ pasta dish.  When the plate arrived I was in love with the size of the fish!  It was HUGE.  Upon first bite I instantly felt like I was eating an omelette.  I took a few more bites and wasn't happy.  All I could taste was fried egg and no fish.  Trace came to check on us and I asked him if the fish was coated in egg then pan fried.  He told me they do a light egg wash on the fish before cooking.  I told him all I could taste was egg and I was bummed because I absolutely love orange roughy.  He gladly brought me a menu to order something else.  I tried ordering the ravioli but they had ran out.  Bummer.  I then ordered the tortellini and was very happy with that dish.  Husband got the veal parm and he liked it quite a bit.  I had a bite and it was good.    All of their food tasted very fresh and the textures were spot on.  I can't wait to return to this place soon.  It's a 40 min drive from my area to the restaurant but it's so worth it!",

The food is exquisite - complex flavors that taste like a garden. The sea food is fresh and cooked to perfection.   I had the red snapper and the fillet was perfectly undercooked so that when the warm sauce was placed on it it arrived at the table perfectly cooked. That takes skill! I get tired of over cooked fish because the chef doesn't realize the fish will continue to cook as it waits on my plate.   The owners and staff are real Italians. They love the Mets and actually speak Italian. Every time I return to Phoenix this is where I go for real Italian from Italian/Americans that make you a part of their family when you come in. And don't be surprised if you see a celebrity here. Word gets around.",

Although it was a bit late, they welcomed us right in and treated us to an incredible dinner. We started with the Caprese and garlic bread - both excellent. Instead of getting separate dishes we ordered family style so we could try a few different ones. The salmon was perfectly cooked, the spaghetti bolognese, and the ravioli were delicious! We finished with one of the best spumoni I've ever had and a great tiramisu. I also enjoyed a glass of Chianti and sambuca for after dinner. The sambuca was delivered on fire with three coffee beans for the past, present and future. Service was excellent and our entire family loved it! We'll be back anytime we visit Phoenix! Thanks for making our first night of vacation just right! :)",

All our entrees came with a leafy green salad.  The salad was good - nothing special, but it was just a leafy green salad. My veal parm came with spaghetti and it was yummy. The veal was breaded and fried just right.  And the spaghetti was the perfect companion.  I sopped up the sauce with the garlic bread they served with dinner. Everyone else at the table really enjoyed their meals too.  Lastly, our service was very good too. Overall, if you want a really solid Italian meal, this would be a great choice.",

After the meal he recommended a drink to my friend and I to have as a nice finishing touch. He taught us the importance of it and how to drink it. It really added a unique and special touch that my friend and I won't forget. All in all they provided us with a spectacular experience and a memorable one.",

I'm glad we were so fortunate as to have been accommodated - we were blown away. A member of our party, who grew up enjoying handmade Italian food prepared by his own family, noted the ravioli was excellent. The gnocchi was also delicious and the texture of the handmade potato pasta so satisfying. The yelp reviews are to be believed - you will not regret a visit to Tutti Santi.  Don't forget the tiramisu!   Looking forward to the next visit! Thank you Tutti Santi!",

The menu offers a variety of traditional Italian dishes, in which they hold a very authentic taste. There were six of us, and non of us were unsatisfied with the food tasting and wine. The lighting at our table could have been a little better (very dark)...perhaps, to enjoy the food's presentation (hence, pictures for Yelp).  It's a great spot for authentic Italian dining (we were craving for pastas).",

The service is top notch.     Their gnocchi is, in my opinion, the best in the Valley.  Try it with their pink sauce (you need to request this as the menu lists a cream sauce with a splash of marinara).    My husband loves the Ravioli alla Nina.  It's so good. Sometimes ravioli dishes are so darn heavy, but not here!  Nina's sauces  achieve the fine balance of lightness and flavor and this dish is a prime example.  Finally, try the tiramisu.  Light, fluffy and packed with flavor, this dessert is a great way to end a wonderful meal.",

Robbie- stop giving us such wonderful super Tuscan's ... or don't... the wine is wonderful as is your hospitality. Have been in the industry for over 15 years and we can't thank you enough for our experiences there.   Try the house penne- artichoke and watercress with plenty of garlic... and order the tiramisu ahead of time with your ouzo! It runs out fast. Bon Appetite!  Angela",

The first time we came it was amazing. The food was great, service was awesome, and it was a great atmosphere for the family gathering.   The second time I went the food was good, but the server forgot an appetizer (not a huge deal) and it was a mess trying to get it taken off the ticket.   Tonight was again absolutely amazing. We started with the calamari, which had tons of flavor and wasn't overcooked. My wife got the ravioli and I got the chicken della casa. The chicken was cooked well and the sauce was out of this world. The ravioli was as good as ravioli can get. Service tonight was the best service that I have experienced anywhere in Phoenix, reminded me of eating in NOLA.  Overall great food, if service is on it's amazing, and the atmosphere is really nice.",

    "text": "Tutti Santi is one of our valley jewels. Nina is so wonderful, I hope you can meet her -- her hospitality and joy in preparing a feast for you and your guests is very hard to match.  I went to celebrate a friend's birthday, so I started with a bottle of champagne. I know it's very Reunite of me, but I like Spumanti. And there it was on the list. Excellent. Followed with a bottle of Pinot Gris, but it was too cold.  Linguine with Clams was divine. Didn't have the creamy thickness of the lavish dish I had in Venice last month until I dumped half the shaker's Parmesan on top (ok, it was closer to 3/4 of the shaker), but oh, SO good. The sourdough bread was hot and fresh -- mmm, my favorite.  We finished off with a flaming shot of licorice liqueur. I wasted so much time taking a picture of it, the glass burned my lips when I actually got to tasting it. LOL.  Tutti is not pretentious, just very good food and excellent service. A must try.",

    "text": "We cannot believe that this restaurant is rated so highly on YELP & Opentable. We arrived for a 7:30 reservation and had to wait 20 minutes for a table - hostess was very scattered. When we were seated we received water...and then proceeded to wait for another 20 minutes before we received any service. Finally, a very unkempt & sweating waiter came to the table asking if we wanted drinks - my partner had a glass of red wine (good) & I ordered a Lemon Drop martini. The wine & martini arrived & my Lemon Drop martini was blue because there was blue curacao in it. The 'hits' just kept piling up...we ordered the beef carpaccio appetizer, my partner lasagna (something they're known for) & I ordered veal parm.  Only to have the waiter return & tell us that our carpaccio wasn't available because the 'machine that makes it is broken.' So we skipped the apppetizer. The complimentary salad was slapped down on our table & consisted of dressiing, lots of lettuce leaves & a singular thin tomato. It was ok.  Our entrees arrived...my partners 'lasagna' was basically 2 tubes of ricotta cheese with a huge amount of red sauce...no meat nor mozzarella chese & a very slight portion. My veal was ok although it tasted more like a ground patty than a piece of veal.  Thiis restaurant is by far not a 'keeper.'",

    "text": "A coworker and I went to this restaurant on the way to the airport to leave Phoenix. We were seated and it took quite a while for our waiter(ponytailed man who looked homeless) to bring our drinks, the restaurant wasn't even very busy. He was kind and did not appear as though he was happy to serve us. I ordered the lasagna, and was very pleased with the food itself. The problem was that there wasn't enough of it! The portions could easily be doubled! We had a flight to catch so we asked our waiter for the check and TOLD HIM we had a flight to catch. We waited about 10 minutes for Mr. Ponytail to bring the check. Then once he eventually came back to pick it up, it took him another 15 minutes to count change and bring it back. While we are waiting for our change to come back, Mr. Ponytail is spending his time watching the magician! What, is somebody else counting our change for him?! Or is he just making us wait on purpose knowing that we had a plane to catch?! I don't know what Mr Ponytail's intentions were, but I do know that he was an awful waiter and the service we received from him was pitiful. However, the Hispanic man refilling our drinks and taking our empty plates was very polite and moved quick to get things done. Overall, the food itself was good, but the portions were way too small. The poor experience was 90% due to the terrible service. Had the service been good, I would have rated this place 4/5 stars, but dirty old Mr Ponytail ruined that review for you.",

Their Lasagna was so perfect and flavorful. The tender Lasagna topped with a mozzarella so perfect words cannot describe could easily be called the crown jewel of this restaurant. The spinach stuffed ravioli was second to none. Each bite was a teip to heaven in a buick le sabre driven by God himself. The service was easily the best I've ever had, anywhere. The waiter was hilarious and a other staff was friendly and helpful. Before we left I believeit was Mama Santi walked me out and pinched my cheekies! I am absolutely in love with this restaurant and highly recommend that if you live in or are visiting Phoenix, you must visit. This restaurant really does make you feel like family.",

The first foremost is the food is outstanding! we sat at the bar like we do at most places and weer quickly greeted by the giddy bartender. I ordered wine husband a lemon drop martini. The bartender made the lemon drop and added a splash of Rasp liqueur in at the end to make it \"extra special. Quickly a hot basket of garlic bread arrived. Yay luv garlic bread. We ordered stuffed mushroom to start. Not my choice but hey they were good. It was so difficult deciding what to order due to their amazing menu. I finally decided on a shrimp fettuccine dish that was prepared with cognac, cream, wild mushrooms and shrimp. Orgasmic doesn't cover it. These were huge lump shrimp that tasted like lobster. By far one of the most memorable dishes I have eaten in years. Husband ordered Gnocchi. Wow amazing delicate covered in tomato cream sauce, made hrs before our arrival. The company of the staff mixed with the amazing authentic food bring me back to this place prob in the next week. I advise to to go this place for some amazing hands down top notch food.",

The server was extremely attentive... we got water and the wine arrived at the table a few minutes after we ordered. The group started with the fried calamari with a side of marinara, which I didn't care for. I ordered the linguine with clams in white wine sauce, very tasty, although the pasta was a little overcooked. My wife had the eggplant parmigiana which was good, but not the best she has ever had. The desserts were Bindi desserts imported from Italy. We had the torta della nonna, a lemon cream pine nut tart, which was very good.  We finished the night with a shot of sambuca flambe'....nice touch.  Overall I like Tutti i Santi, it always feels like you are in an old restaurant in a \" piazza\"in Italy.",

Little did we know that the food would not be as up to scale as the dimly lit decorations. My sister and I got chicken Cesar salads with chicken that was very dry and seemed and tasted like end of the day scraps. Also my brother-in-law's salmon and muscles tasted like sea water which resulted in bubble guts later that night. On top of all this, Tutti Santi is also pretty pricey. $15 for a minuscule could-have-been-rat-for-all-we-know Cesar salad. Good luck dinner goers.",

    "text": "Went here through Deal Chicken...$59 for $144 worth of food with a bottle of wine, seemed like a great deal - unfortunately, it wasn't.  White the food and service were both good - portions were miniscule.  We both had mussels as an appetizer, and were given a 1/2 portion each, with about 8-10 mussels.  The main course was OK, but the side pasta was less than about a cup's worth.  Dessert was cheesecake - it was a half-portion cut into two slices- enough for 3 forkfuls.  So, what seemed like a great deal was a huge disappointment.  In these struggling times I can understand that restaurants need customers, but to say they are giving $144 worth of food when dividing portions in less than half left us feeling ripped off.  Perhaps if they would have disclosed beforehand that the portions were smaller than the regular menu this would have been a different type of review.  It has certainly given me pause to consider something like this in the future - before purchasing it might be a good idea to contact the restaurant and ask.....live and learn.",

    "text": "To start off if I could give more stars I would.  We wanted a nice local restaurant and found Tutti Santi.  Oh my goodness.  We had a party of 10 and our waiter was awesome!!! Very attentive, funny, answered our questions, and even one of our teenagers wanted to adopt as her grandpa.  We got stuffed mushrooms and Prosciutto e Melone for appetizers.  Both were delicious!!  Soup - cream of potato and carrot with a hint of kick at the end.  Really liked the soup.  Salad - shredded romaine or green leaf lettuce with a slice of Roma tomato and dressed with the perfect amount of a balsamic/oil vinaigrette.   7 of us ordered something different with three ordering the same dish:   Homemade Gnocchi-  to die for, they melted in your mouth and just the perfect amount of sauce  Orange Roughy Genovese with Penne Aglio E. Olio - fish melted in your mouth with the perfect lemon butter sauce with caper and artichoke hearts and small serving of penne pasta with olive oil and garlic sauce.  Probably never find that great taste anywhere else.  Chicken Parmigiana with Spaghetti al Pamadoro - tasted great, but the one who ate it prefers a heavier breading on the chicken. This one has a light breading.  Homemade ravioli Allan Nina - definitely homemade and fresh cheese light tomato sauce.  Good.  Spaghetti el bolognese- added sausage.  It was really good but \"not as good as my moms\".  It was eaten all up.  Veal Parmigiana with Spaghetti al Pamadoro - tender sliced and lightly breaded veal cutlets, served with spaghetti and tomato sauce. Eaten all up. Only complaint was the cheese melted on top of veal overpowered the taste of the veal.  Chicken al Momento with Spaghetti - loads of chunky tomato sauce and spaghetti noodles  Veal cutlets topped with asparagus and Crab meat, fontina cheese, Marsala sauce without mushrooms.  Eaten all up.  Everyone cleaned their plates, using the bread we were given to \"mop\" up the sauce.  Authentic Italian food!!!!  We even had a magician come to our table for entertainment. He was really good.  Great ending to a wonderful night.  You won't be sorry.",

We walked in, the place was a little dark and packed but they happen to have a table for two open so we got seated right away.  I liked the place right away as well.  It reminded me of a restaurant I use to work at when I was younger with rooms like a house.  Anyway we met Tom, I think his name was Tom, our waiter.  What a guy.  I was trying to be careful what kind of red wine to order as my gf is a beginner but Tom took charge and recommended Tormaresca.  I was very impressed.  My gf loved it. Then he recommended a couple of pastas, i couldn't remember the names but they were delicious.  We ordered escargot for appetizer of course and stuffed mushrooms.  I've had better but they were good also.  What surprised me the most about the place was Tom.  He was very caring, he took charge in a friendly way, genuine, and definitely knows his craft.  I hope I can request for Tom when we go back with our daughter who loves pasta.  Thank you very much Tom from the bottom of my heart.  See you again soon.",

We ate everything that was put in front of us and that was no small feat as the portions were generous too! We tried the ravioli, gnocchi, calamari, and creme brulee and enjoyed every last bite. The only criticism is that the bar could use a simple cocktail program to keep up with the trendier restaurants. They have plenty of wine but just 3 or 4 premium cocktails would would send it past the tipping point. That didn't take away from our 5 star experience though. We will definitely be back.",

The potato  leak soup was very good . Portions  could have been larger . We had the gnocchi.  Which was very good,  a little  soft .  I ordered  a spicy shrimp  with angel hair pasta. It was  decent . Prices  averaged 15 to 24 per dish . We did like the tirimisu  which was very good .",

    "text": "In my line of work I am fortunate to eat quite a bit in restaurants but have to say my visit to Tutti Santi was by far the most awkward and just uncomfortable restaurant visits I have ever experienced  The only reason I am not ranking this a 1 star or below is that the food was quite good. I had the ravioli - the sauce was an exceptionally nice balance of tomatoes and cheese. The pasta was a bit undercooked but not so undercooked the food couldn't be eaten. I ate most of it and actually enjoyed it. My daughter's spaghetti was good. The problem was the service, cleanliness and overall awkward ambiance.  We arrived around 5:30 on a Sautrday evening. Only one other table was occupied at the time so they were not busy. We were seated and looking at the menu when the waiter ( who didn't bother to introduce himself) arrived at the table and asked what we wanted to drink. I gave my order but I guess my daughter was taking too long to decide and he glared at her and said \"hello\" in a snarky tone then without waiting for her reply, announced he'd return later. He scurried off and moments later we heard yelling coming from what I assume was the kitchen - and not just friendly, kitchen banter - this was full-on name calling and swearing  - it appeared to be some dispute amongst the Staff. There was no attempt amongst them to hash out their issues discretely - their fight was overheard by everyone in the dining room. There were six people in the dining room at the time - me and my daughter and two other couples. It was clear we all heard the cussing and yelling but nobody in management bothered to offer an apology to the customers- there was no attempt to put the customers at ease.  When our waiter returned, he announced that he had forgotten to tell us about the specials but said he assumed we didn't want to hear about them anyway - another awkward moment as we still don't know why the waiter would have assumed such a thing. We finally ordered - I originally ordered gnocchi- which I was looking forward to but a few minutes after our order was put in I was advised by the waiter (whose name we still did not know) that the gnocchi was not yet made. I ordered ravioli as a backup. Salads arrived fairly quickly and consisted of lettuce, one slice of a mushy tomato covered in a pretty tasty vinaigrette.  Food arrived soon after. There was no offer from the waiter to top with freshly ground pepper or fresh Parmesan but there was a bowl of dried Parmesan on the table and salt and pepper shakers so no real surprise there.  Throughout our meal, our waiter (whose name we still did not know) did not check on us, did ask if everything was ok although to be fair he did acknowledge us once as he passed our table en route to another table ( by this point there were a few more customers). He simply asked if everything was ok as he passed by. Had he returned at any point after that, we would have told him about the bits of food encrusted on my daughters water glass and on the bottom rim of her plate. But throughout our meal we never got a chance to address our concerns with our waiter as for some reason he seemed to go out of his way to avoid us - and we still didn't know his name. About 10 minutes after the bus boy cleared away our plates we asked (the bus boy) to bring our check. Our waiter dropped it off a few minutes later on his way to another table, barely pausing to leave the check as he continued on his way. We asked the bus boy if we could speak to the owner or manager - oddly, owner or manager never came to our table either. After a few minutes we paid our bill and started to leave. our waiter was stationed near the bar and asked if we had enjoyed our meal. I said we had concerns and wanted to talk to the manager. He said he was one of the managers. We told him our concerns then he told us the restaurant was one of the top rated restaurants in the city (his way I guess of demeaning our concerns). He said if we ever return to the restaurant let him know and he'll \"make it right\" and to ask for him. At that point we finally learned his name - Andreas.  Tip to restaurant owners and managers - if a customer leaves upset, they aren't coming back. At that point you've lost your shot at another chance.",

In fact, the entire experience was fantastic. My friend has been coming here for years and is well acquainted with the staff, so it was fun getting to know all the servers. We had like 4 different servers waiting on us, so clearly we got plenty of attention! But I guess that's what a table of 5 ladies will do to a place!   Besides the wonderful service, the food was just delicious. We had calamari, good, and carpaccio, which was the best I've ever had, hands down. For entrees one girl got the homemade gnocchi. Holy savior! I cannot tell you how that melted in my mouth. The sauces were just indescribably delectable! Another girl got a seafood Alfredo thing, chocked full of mushrooms. The Alfredo wasn't just thick and intense like most. This was the perfect combination of cheesy, creamy goodness. The other 3 of us got cioppino. Oh my. No words could do this spicy, seafood pack dish justice.  We spent a pretty penny, but it was worth every cent!",

    "text": "My friend and I ate at the other location in Scottsdale just a few nights ago. We were not very hungry and shared that gnocchi and ravioli and it was amazing.  Since we both love Italian food we came back for more at the location in Phoenix.   I loved the homemade gnocchi so much I had to order it again. It is made with a cream sauce and has a touch of red sauce on top. For being a slightly more filling type of pasta the cream sauce is perfect. It's light and flavorful without being to heavy. The red sauce is very delicious too.   I personally am not a seafood fan; however, my friend ordered the seafood linguine and she loved it. She said that there was an amazing amount of seafood in it. She was able to fill up on essentially just the seafood and only had a small portion of the linguine. She did also loved the flavor of the pasta.  Prior to the meal you receive a basket of bread that has been warmed with olive oil and fresh minced garlic. Yum!  Upon reading other peoples reviews of the house salad...we knew to anticipate lettuce and tomato with a balsamic dressing. Although it is a very basic salad the flavors are still amazing. The tomato has a balsamic vinaigrette dressing with small bits of basil. I chopped up part of my tomato and placed on the garlic bread and made a small bruschetta :) also added some of the Parmesan to the salad! I'm not a big fan of salad in general and it was very enjoyable to me.   We ended our meal with dessert. Although we both like Tiramisu...we love creme brulee even more. There creme brulee was very good with a perfectly toasted top and a smooth and creamy custard. It had it diced strawberries on top too.  Another thing that made this restaurant  amazing, was our server. He was kind, friendly, attentive, energetic, and fun. He definitely made our dining experience better. The great thing about this restaurant is you can order what you want and the food will be good.  We finished the night here with a flaming Sambuca shot.  This was really fun and on the house!! Did I mention that our server was AMAZING!!!   If I lived in this area I would eat at this restaurant all the time. it puts chain Italian restaurants to shame!  If I'm ever back in this area I will have to return here. I hope you try it out and have a great experience like we did!",

    "text": "So my family and I came into town for a hockey tournament.  A good friend of mine highly recommended we come here to Tutti Santi for a dinner.    The first free night we were going to have was a Sunday night which happened to be Valentine's Day.  I called at 1030 that morning to try to make a 7o'clock reservation.  I spoke to Robbie (I hope I got that right).  We chatted for a good ten minutes, most of that time laughing.  Robbie was able to get us a table reservation for five at 7 PM. Yes, same day reservation for five on Valentine's Day; miracle worker.  Robbie said he wanted to meet my family and me when we got there that night.  I was hoping to meet him too but didn't expect to.  When we were seated, our server Vincent, greeted us by asking my youngest son if we were from the San Francisco bay area.  Clearly Robbie had taken notes during our phone call.  Then Robbie showed up at our table and introduced himself, embracing my wife with a hug and kissing her cheeks.  What a reception.  We felt so important and like we were family.  Our night just kept on getting better from there.  Vincent was so great.  He and my father were comparing their days in the military.  For a moment I thought he was gong to pull up a seat and have dinner with us.  So that was the customer service. We weren't actually customers, we were treated as family.  Now the food.  My friend recommended the veal so that's what I ordered.  No let down here, Superb!  My wife had the Cioppino which was a special for the night.  Keep in mind that we are from the SF Bay Area ( the literal home of Cioppino). This should be on the menu everyday it was so wonderful.  One of my sons asked for the raviolis minus the sauce.  He loved them and I swooped one for myself.  The cheese was so creamy.  My other boy had a huge plate of spaghetti which he gobbled up after a long day of hockey and swimming.  My father had the Gnocchi at Vincent's suggestion saying he was taking a chance on something he usually would not order.  My father is a very lite eater but his plate was clean when it was time to leave.  Cost; family of five, my wife and I both had beers with dinner (we are not wine drinkers).  Our bill was about $120 before tip.  Departing words: If you are in the area, I highly recommend you go here; you will not be disappointed.  Our experience was worth every penny and then some.  A warm welcome, a great meal, and great memories.",

Sadly, the waiter seemed miffed that we didn't order drinks or dinner. He was overheard complaining to the kitchen as we left.

    "text": "I've been here many times, but never left a review..and I'm not sure why, as I love this place. So..let's fix that. Tutti Santi is one of my favorite places to dine in Phx. Tonight I brought a party of five close friends to this restaurant; none had ever been there prior. Long story short: food was outstanding as usual, service was great and my friends thought it was some of the best Italian food they've had. When you recommend a place to meet up with friends, you're vouching for the quality based on past experience. There's also that nagging concern that you might catch them on an \"off\" night and end up explaining to your friends that it's usually better than this....well, none of that tonight. Tutti Santi was perfect and my friends enjoyed everything about it. By the way, try the Linguine del Marinaio (seafood pasta dish). It's ridiculously good!!",

    "text": "Here what we had:  1. Eggplant parmigiana with spaghetti.  Requested not to put cheese on MY PASTA.  The last time they did, it had too much cheese on it.  So today I said: no cheese on my pasta.  The result:  No cheese on my eggplant parmigiana either.  How do you leave out the cheese on eggplant PARMIGIANA?  I didn't say anything. I ate it.  The red sauce was good though.    2.  Ordered chicken cutlet with an eggplant cutlet on top of it, WITH SAUCE  (spicy, please), NO CHEESE.  The result:  A weight-watchers portion of chicken, meaning, it would FIT IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND--AND IT DID.  90% of the plate was filled with penne pasta with sauce.  Hubby did say the chicken was super-delicious---what there was of it.  I never saw anything so small but he didn't complain to the waiter--I would have.  And the cost of this weight-watchers piece of chicken?? $21.50 American dollars --wow.  The last time we were here it was a regular portion and when we go to their Scottsdale location, the portion is quite large so we were shocked by the smallness of the chicken portion in relation to the cost.   3  The complimentary garlic bread was tasty. 4.  The mushroom soup which comes with the meal was very delicious.   The salad was mostly  greens and one slice of tomato but was fresh.   5. Were given Complimentary Sambuca at the end of the meal. but we would have preferred more chicken in the dish instead. 6.  I really prefer the on-line menu to match the restaurant menu.  This is a case when it did not.  So you come in ready to order what you want and it is not on the menu.   7.  Nice piped in music with mostly italian classics.  Nice.  The waiters singing along with the music, not so nice.   Trace was our server.   A tad disappointed today.",

He looks like Al Pacino and purportedly attended acting classes with the real Al along with DeNiro in the 60's.   The Escargot and dinner salad were good but the best of the night was a Veal Francese. Tender and in a wonderfully prepared sauce of white wine, butter and capers. The Eggplant Parmesan was delicious as was the Cannoli for dessert. Excellent all the way around. It's a small place and can get intimate really fast if you have loud neighbors. Great choice and worth a visit when your looking for baci di dama.",

Don't get me wrong the other location still has delicious food but I felt like the service in this one was more homie and attentive. Our server jimmy was great and we met Deborah & Roberto who were so welcoming. This night we had the mussels appetizer it white garlic sauce which is one of my favorites dishes here; the broth is just mouth watering! Lol we also had ravioli as an appetizers (thanks tutti santi for this gift) my boyfriend loved the ravioli so much, he order a full plate for his entree. I had the special of the night which was veal with crab meats and Marsela sauce; very tasty. We have only found two Italian restaurants in Phoenix where we enjoy the  food & service; Tutti santi is one of them",

    "text": "When reviewing a business I generally like to give them some room for improvement.  I'm not sure how Tutti Santi can improve on perfection.    Their wait staff is excellent.  Our waiter, I think his name is Brian, was perfect.  He checked on us just enough to be sure we were happy without constantly interrupting our conversation.  The other wait staff never allowed our water glasses to be less than half full and they did so without really being noticed.    The salad was exactly as Brian (Sorry if I got your name wrong) described, greens and tomatoes with the house vinaigrette.  I knew exactly what to expect so wasn't disappointed by a boring salad.  Oh and the Garlic Bread was perfect.   I don't usually like garlic bread.  Theirs was crispy and chewy at the same time and not too garlicy.  I almost asked for more, but didn't want to fill up on bread.  I ordered the Lasagne and my guest ordered the seafood pasta special.  My lasagne was excellent, the noodles were very light, the cheese and sauce delicious.  I ate every bite and was sorely tempted to lick the plate.  I did manage to refrain but just barely.  Fortunately someone came and took the plate before I succumbed to the temptation.     My guests seafood dish was quite pricey at around $35 but he said it was delicious and full of all kinds of different sea creatures.  He managed to eat all of the fishy stuff but couldn't finish his pasta.  He was also very happy with the wine he ordered, which Brian suggested.    Even though I was about to lick my plate and he didn't finish his dinner we still ordered the Tiramisu to share and an espresso to finish our meal.  It was the perfect ending.    The Tiramisu was light and delicious and the espresso was dark, slightly bitter and very strong.  I've had better, but my guest said that the espresso was very typical of what you would get in Europe.    Love, Love, Love everything about this place, can't wait to go back again soon!",

The small place provided the necessary decor and ambiance to really establish bistro as a fine dining Establishment.   I had the Veal Marsela which i had to say was fantastic.  Just the right amount of sauce to really, and the wine i had went great with the veal.  Everyone that i was with loved the food and our waiter was excellent.

I am not a big fan of calamari, never have been, would certainly order again, tender, fresh, not overly breaded with the perfect marinara sauce I am sure it was made from tomatoes from the river rich dirt of the Dakotas.  Entree's of braised lamb shank frank the foodie had and pretty much licked the plate.  I had the seaford fra diablo, the spice spot hot, not too hot and not too wimpy.  The service excellent, Jesse our waiter a definite will request again.  Deal chicken or not we will be back in short order",
