What a pleasant surprise this restaurant was, the food was great and our server, Lisa Tussing, who is studying to get her sommelier's designation was a big part of the reason the meal was so enjoyable. I had the surf and turf and one of my son's had the ribs with mac and cheese. Everyone enjoyed their meal, the presentation was great and the wine pairings that Lisa suggested were fabulous. We enjoyed this restaurant so much, we came back on Monday evening, even though the \"fancier restaurant\" was also open. I suggest the s'mores for dessert, although the creme brulee and the warm apple cobbler with ice cream was delicious too. Will definitely come back to this restaurant.",

I guess if you are interested in Frank Lloyd Wright architecture and staying at the Biltmore, its worth a visit, but not necessarily worth a special trip.  Fries poached in duck fat - very good, very well done Grass fed sliders/hamburger - meat was good, bun was a little hard Pizza - was actually quite tasty but not New Haven pizza - I think there is too much fat in the crust.  But even though it isn't authentic, it is nonetheless tasty. Broccoli rabe - tasty, but a tad over cooked, a bit mushy Angel hair pasta with olives - WAAAY too many olives. I love olives and this one was just overkill. Also, how is it that restaurants can make their pasta al dente?  pasta was overcooked. Chicken and goat cheese flat bread - very good the figs and argula made it a very tasty and relatively healthy option \"famous\" meatloaf - meh, but then again I have never been wowed by meatloa Short ribs - okay, not great. Salmon - It first came out too dry (overcooked) we had it returned and a new one came back cold. FAIL Prime Rib - was very good, the potato was GINORMOUS  Though the Yelp review says $$, it's probably closer to $$$ - since most of the main dishes were in the $20-$30 range.  So with appetizers and drinks, the per person price was closer to $45-$50 than under $30.",

I eat out almost every day due to my job, and I cannot recommend this restaurant unless you are stuck at the hotel and have no other options.",

The food was disappointing for the price.   The hotel is excellent.  The food was less than average.    They use too much salt in their cooking for my taste.  The meatloaf reads interesting and was recommended by a bar tender - don't do that.  Three of the party had prime rib and said it was as good as the \"Saturday night special\" any place in the country except the potatoes were undercooked.

Since the other breakfast place they had was only a cafe that served baked goods, I decided to come here to have a proper breakfast.  When I asked what they recommended they immediately said \"the Biltmore Benedict\".  I was easily sold so I ordered one, and a coffee.  Cool thing about the coffee is they just bring you a carafe to serve yourself coffee as you please.  Not sure if this was because the waitress was lazy, but I thought it was nice.  The eggs benedict themselves were not the best.  On one hand the ham that they used was overcooked (ie. jerky).  On the other hand the english muffin was over toasted and too crispy, which kinda ruined the overall consistency.  It is a nice patio that they have to sit on, so I will give them that.  They apparently have a bird problem where birds kinda come and scavenge for food.  I didn't really mind it.",

The prices are pretty steep, but it's within a resort so you have to expect your meatloaf dinner to be over $20. We sampled many different dishes such as the turkey meatloaf with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies within the potatoes, empanadas, pizza and the yummy and not too greasy hamburger served on an English muffin. I found the food to be very good, but a bit pricey.  Our server Alexis was awesome! She was so friendly and made sure we had everything we needed.  I didn't get to try any of their desserts, but everything on the dessert menu sounded delicious.  Despite the high prices I would go back.",

Such potential too, great service, a gorgeous space, but the menu choices are lacking imagination although the presentation is excellent. But I go to a restaurant for the FOOD, and even their \"signature meatloaf\" was over-cooked and dry, the brisket \"special\" was very tough and thick and very fatty and also over-cooked. We had the chicken meatball appetizer which was the best thing we had, and the desserts were also excellent. Too bad the chef-de-cuisine doesn't know how to cook meat. A great place if you're stuck at a hotel, but there are MUCH better places close-by in the Biltmore fashion park.",

I should have listened to my own advice because after having a way-too-sweet happy hour Prickly Peartini I decided I needed a \"big boy\" drink and ordered a regular martini.  While the regular martini was decent, I should have stuck to the Prickly because $17 was outrageous for the size they give you.  My wife made the same mistake and ordered a $15 glass of wine instead of their \"house\" wine which would have been $5.  Needless to say we learned our lesson when it comes to drinks at this place.  We were a bit smarter about the food.  We shared a \"Savory Nibbles\" platter which is a selection of 4 very small....nibbles.  We shared the deviled egg, meatloaf slider, grilled cheese and the shrimp and manchego flat.  It was all excellent and I could have eaten an entire plate full of any one of those things.  Be warned that they are only a very small taste and only enough for one bite each if you are sharing with another person.  Anyway its not bad for $5 during happy hour.  There are 3 or so other selections that looked good as well.  3 or so of their other appetizers are 1/2 off during happy hour so we ordered the Charred Chicken Lollipops.  You get a decent portion of small chicken drumstick things in some tasty sauce.  They are NOT fried and weren't drowned in sauce.  Anyway, these were excellent and I would definitely order them again.   Like most decent happy hours in the valley, this one was quite typical in terms of service.  The bar area gets a bit crowded and it takes forever to get a drink and food.  It is not really the waiters' fault because they are going almost as fast as they can.  The problem is that there aren't enough of them so they are stuck serving way to many tables.",

Started with a shared Waldorf Salad.....tangy dressing was like a vinaigrette mixed with yogurt.  Pretty good.  Crisped bits of bacon were tasty, but there were CHUNKS of bacon fat in the mix, which I used to gross out my wife.  That was not good.  Otherwise, just order the salad and ask them to keep out the bacon fat chunks.  She had pan roasted salmon, not her favorite way to have it cooked, but she tried to keep an open mind.  At the end, she felt it was just \"ok\".  I had the short rib.  It was overall the most disappointing short rib ever.  Beautiful and deliciously creamy polenta with corn salsa was amazingly tasty, but the rib was like a big piece of stew beef.    It broke apart in strings, like pre-pulled pork.  A great short rib should be tender, flavorful, juicy and supple....this was chewy-chewy.  Supposedly it was rubbed with mole, but I couldn't taste it.  Not bad enough to send back, but not good enough to order again.  We shared the butterscotch pudding, and that was one of the best restaurant desserts we have had.  Try it!  With drinks and tip, the bill was $129.11",

First up, lunch: quesadilla was full of BBQ sauce (like completely smothered). It was called a bbq chicken quesadilla, but i thought it just meant that the chicken was barbecued, and sauce would be on the side. Not so. It was okay, but not great. Iced tea was just so-so, and at $4.00, the drinks should be spectacular. There's no reason a fountain drink should cost that much, ever. Even if the tea was brewed, this is tea, after all. Not like it was brewed with water that someone had to trek and get from the melting ice caps.  Sunday dinner: had the \"famous\" tortilla soup. Good, but nothing I would call famous.   Last lunch/dinner: tried the buttermilk chicken bites, which were much smaller than I expected, but the breading was nice and crispy, and the sauce wasn't too much. I could have easily gotten something else to go along with it, but had to head to the airport. I liked this much more than the quesadilla.  Prices were reasonable.",

That being said, I get it....it IS the Arizona Biltmore so you are expected to unload a lot of money here as it is a five star resort. We were guests for the Biltmore's Easter activities and our children enjoyed an egg hunt, in addition to an adorable carnival. We had an 11:15am reservation to Frank & Albert's which I had booked almost 3 weeks in advance. I assumed it would probably be packed. After all the Easter festivities, we got to the restaurant 10 minutes early. I checked in with the hostess to see if we could be seated earlier than our reservation time. I glanced around at the restaurant and it was half empty. I was told no, and to return at 11:15am. No biggie, as my kids enjoyed playing chess outside at the nearby outdoor chessboard. At 11:15 we returned and were finally seated at a booth with two sets of silverware tucked inside a rolled up napkin.  Sherry was our server and she was very pleasant. Our kids opted to order off the menu, whereas my husband and I had the breakfast buffet, which has a nice variety of warm breakfast foods, an omelet station, cured meats and cheese platter, fresh fruit, pastry basket variety (our faves were the mini chocolate croissant), yogurt and oatmeal. It was plenty filling for all of us. Though Sherry was kind to bring out our food and refill our drinks, we had to fend for ourselves to get three additional napkins and silverware for our family. After we were finished eating, it took quite awhile to flag our server so we could get the check to pay our bill. We weren't quite sure what caused such a delay considering the fact it wasn't busy (by the time we left, the restaurant was still half empty). Maybe it was a fluke, or maybe we should have come for dinner time on another day, but the food was just OK, and nothing I'd consider noteworthy or outstanding. For a restaurant on property at a resort of this caliber, I had higher expectations of the food quality and service.",

I had a sort of southwest inspired Benedict (without the ham) and the corn 'cake' underneath was to die for and laced with chilis.  We were given a large pot of decaf which was wonderfully brewed.  Our roasted breakfast potatoes were actually \"roasted to perfection.\"  (It's funny how so many menus will say something is prepared \"to perfection\" and how little it's actually True, but it was True here and they didn't actually say it on the menu.)  We also enjoyed our server who was entertaining, friendly and accommodating.  Switch over to evening and our 2nd meal at F&A's - dinner.  The food was decent but not spectacular.  I'm pretty sure the Ceasar salad had MSG in the dressing because I only had two bites of my boyfriend's salad and within a few minutes I was well into an MSG reaction.  So, docking a star for that.  The roasted winter vegetables were sublime.  I'd never really enjoyed parsnips before, but these ones rocked.  If you don't feel like leaving \"campus\" Frank & Albert's will do you right.  (Just watch out for the MSG.)",

The dessert selection was abundant and delicious.  We were greeted by very friendly staff as soon as we walked in.

Wonderful service, very attentive and a charmer as well. Lots of ma'am and sirs to my hubby and I, young miss and the young gentlemen to our teenage kids. Pampered! Drinks came quickly, water and sodas refilled often.  The food! My daughter and I split the ribeye with potato gratin. To die for, we were both in heaven! Sauce for the steak was on point, asparagus good but could have used a better trim and a touch of lemon, but that gratin is amazing. Seriously a potato and cream taken to perfection! Hubby had the cheeseburger and fries. He wasn't feeling fancy. But a d@mn decent burger with really good fries. My son was the lucky winner though, with meatloaf of all things! It had to have been 8-10 oz of meatloaf over potato puree, topped with house made chipotle ketchup and fried onion strings. He had the temerity to tell ME! Me! It was better than mine! I made him give me a bite. He wasn't wrong. He wouldn't give me another bite. Jerk! I would have reconsidered my choice of ribeye if not for those potatoes gratin.  I'm looking forward to the next few nights to explore the rest of the menu. Looking forward to the porkchop or filet mignon. Saw and smelled them as they passed. Very promising!",

To be honest, it was more like baby food. To the main meal, I had ordered the special which was fry bread with cilantro chicken, beans, tomato, guacamole and sour cream - almost a taco (average). Everyone else had ordered a burger, which deemed the better option (better than average).

They accommodated plant based/gluten free without a second thought; the servers and chef were very knowledgeable. The brussel sprout/cauliflower salad was exceptional!! Don't miss the table side s'mores! Everything was just fabulous.",

    "text": "Revision: Upon receiving the bill, the server, Ines, chose to add $7.00 for spinach and a few baby tomatoes without my consent. I was very upset by this as I dine here several times per month and have never been upcharged like that. She further went on to suggest I was wrong when I told her I have never been upcharged for spinach and tomatoes! At least tell me before hand. She had no right to make that decision.   Needless to say this is not ok. Perhaps new management choses to encourage staff to uncharge. Not cool management.   Used to love this place. My favorite is lunch but dinner is also very very good.  I believe there is a new chef as there are a lot of new and improved dishes.   The lunch Southwest Chicken Salad is my personal favorite. I always ask for  spinach and little baby tomatoes to be added. The dressing is a very light pineapple citrus vinaigrette. (Don't be fooled by the photo, trust me, it's light).  The Sonoran Turkey Club is also excellent.  And huge! You won't leave hungry. The bread is a house made jalapeno infused bread. Not spicy at all but excellent flavor.   Tip for those doing a pool day-order from F & A first and take to the pool. Better prices and better food in my opinion.",

The tortilla soup was good, but it came out 20 minutes earlier than my husband's soup.  Did the buffet for the holiday. Food was decent but was barely warm. Our waiter came by often but never cleared any plates. He kept rushing us to the buffet, trying to get us to get our mains before we got our soup, etc.  we had our menus and two courses finished with plates still on the table. He asked it he could drop the bill when my husband ordered coffee. When he brought the coffee, he told us it was the last cup and he was brewing another and he could get us to go cups with the fresh batch. The stale cup was full of coffee grounds. We were so disappointed, we just tabbed out and left since he kept hurrying us.  Was a $230 tab for fixed price meal, wine, coffee and auto-grat.  Was disappointed because it was also our anniversary. Shit meal.",

    "text": "Now I know why President Obama skipped the Biltmore on his recent visit. He must have been informed about the Pork Belly and the Corned Beef from Frank and Alberts.  The atmosphere is mostly very impressive. It's very rich and airy. It's very cool Frank Lloyd Wright but with a retro diner kind of feel.  A few things about the atmosphere were not impressive. Dirty Salt and pepper shakers and crumbs on the floor. I also noticed bowls of tortilla chips just sitting out getting stale and dusty on the line the whole time we were seated.   I ordered the house made corned beef sandwich. When it arrived I thought it looked OK and took a bite. All I could taste was sauerkraut. Then I took a piece of meat out to try. It felt slimey and was very fatty. I cut off the fat and tasted the meat and it seemed corned but lacked the spices that flavor the meat. It was pretty tasteless and was just slimey and fatty. I gave a piece to my husband to try and he also said it seemed slimey to him and tasteless. I was hoping our waitress would check on us but she didn't.  I asked my husband how his Pork Belly BLT was. He said the porkbelly and roll was very dry, the bacon was good and the tomatoes were old. I didn't know how dry the porkbelly was until I got home and feed some to my dogs. It was the driest piece of meat I ever felt in my life. It was so dry that if you rubbed your skin with it you could cut yourself on it. I thought my sandwich was awful but after feeling that porkbelly I think his sandwich was worst and both sandwiches were served with cold fries.  We were NEVER checked on or asked how our meal was.  I know I should have found a manager to complain to but sometimes you just get so bummed you don't feel like it. This was suppose to be an extra special meal out at an exceptional place. These sandwiches cost about $16.00 each. Fortunately I have a Scottsdale Preferred Card and had one meal off the check but even if the meals were free they'd still be horrible.   I don't know if my exsperience is typical or not.  If you still want to give them a try after reading my review you have to do a valet park or park yourself in the garage that's around a little way from the restaurant.",

A few of the highlights:  Smashed Avocado - Solid choice for an appetizer.  Meatloaf - This was probably our hands-down favorite item!  I never knew meatloaf could be so good!  Scottish Salmon - Very good but a bit of a small portion.  The salads - I tried several of them and they were all kind of 'meh'.  Granted it's a salad, but the actual end-result didn't quite jive with the super-yummy descriptions.  S'mores Dessert - Who doesn't love roasting marshmallows at their table! :)  Breakfast Buffet - Eh, it was ok.  There was nothing wrong with it per se, but it wasn't always kept full (sometimes the fruit bowls were empty or there was no butter out) and the selection is a little limited.  I will say the omelet station is probably the way to go here.  Service was generally fine, but certainly nothing special.  We also avoided sitting in the back sun-room (despite their attempt to seat us back there every.single.time) because it was absolutely freezing back there!  Overall a good choice if you're staying on the property!",

Three people in our party ordered the caesar salad after the waiter highlighted it. Their special twish was celery, which we all assumed was mixed in for extra crunch. It turns out the entire salad is shaved celery. The celery was just way too stringy and fibrous to really enjoy, plus it watered down the flavor of the caesar dressing. Nice attempt at a twist, but I would say leave that classic alone.   On the positive side, I did really enjoy the burger - great flavor and the homemade chipotle ketchup was awesome (they also have homemade tarragon mustard). My cousin had the meatloaf which looked amazing. He's a 6'2' 16 year old athlete with a refined palate... I didn't even have a chance to ask for a bite before he devoured it, but he said it was awesome.   My experience here was good (hence the A-OK rating), but didn't leave me wanting come back for more. What did, however, was their happy hour menu: lots of great looking deals for $5. I'll have to head over for hh and will update my review.",

Split a flat bread, fries, and a queso dip with my cousin.  All three items were tasty. The fries are the only thing that really stick out to me as they were fried in duck fat, which was truly amazing.  I also had a gin and tonic that was mixed very well.  The service was also very good.   The only reason I am giving the place only two stars is really the price.  I dont feel like the food necessarily lived up to the price.

Probably because we usually stray from them because they are often a billion dollars by the time you leave the place.  We decided upon dinner here while staying at the Biltmore for the Hell City Convention.  Since we live in town, I know the area pretty well so our options were anything in the Biltmore area or Frank & Alberts.  I had passed by the menu earlier and figured we'd try it.  We showed up about 6-7ish for dinner and there was no wait, but plenty of people inside.   We were nicely sat right next to the kitchen and almost instantly our drink orders were taken by the smiling Elizabeth. After our drinks we ordered our food and within 20min, our food was out.  While waiting for our food they gave us some bread and a couple dips that were delicious.  One was a chipotle ketchup and the other was a green olive aole type drip.  Both great.  We ordered some onion rings that came stacked in a nice formation along with some buttermilk ranch.  We all ate a few of those, but had saved more for later.  it was dinner time..    One of our friends had eaten so he grabbed a dessert that he said was one of the best he's ever eaten.  My girlfriend and I ordered the prime rib.  For $25, I thought this was a great price for such a fancy establishment.   I haven't had this tasty of a prime rib cut in a long time.  Every bite was better than the next.  Along with that was a huge piece of broccoli and a nicely cooked baked potato.  The meal was amazing.  But the meal was just a part of it..  Our server Elizabeth would always drop by to make sure we had what we needed.  They were so on top of things, if they over heard us comment on something, they would rush over to make sure we had it.  The staff was ridiculously nice and even the chef came out to check on our food.  I don't think I've ever had a better experience at a restaurant like  I did here.   Frank & Alberts knows food and knows how to take care of their customers.  Well done.  We loved this place so much that we werent here three times during our stay this past weekend.",

    "text": "I had a superb meal during Arizona Restaurant Week. I started with a wonderful salad with an unusual form of green (it was stringy and fiberous, but it was good)-I will give them props for a unique and enjoyable twist on a salad. This was followed by a delicious filet mignon expertly prepared accompanied by french friends paoched in duck fat....just like they make in France!!!! this was topped off by a yummy banana and fruit parfait. The outdoor patio made for a really enjoyable atmosphere.  So why two stars? The service was apathetic from the moment we sat at the bar to order drinks. The bartender and later our server never smiled and acted like they could have cared less about looking after us. They were not overtly rude, but they certainly did not go out of their way to be the least bit pleasant and this made the overall experience VERY disappointing. This is The Biltmore, and I would expect warmer service for the level of diner that would typically patronize this restuarant.    Perhaps because it is The Biltmore, the staff feel the need to do their job with their noses in the air. Or perhaps because we were there for Arizona Restaurant Week, the staff were expecting a lousy tip and wanted to get us in and out as quickly as possible. I have to added that I went with some friends in the service industry. Depsite the bad service, we left 20 percent anyway. If it had been left up to me, I probably would have left 10 percent. There was nothing wrong with my order or my meal, but the collective attitude at that place sucked.  In any case, this experience left me with a very bad impression and I don't think I would go back. And this is unfortunate because the food is exceptional.",

We also had a duck and goat cheese pizza which was awesome and the crust was perfect. There's a lot of kvetching on here about the prices, but this is a high end resort so what do you expect?",

When I was in my room I noticed that they had a short rib mac & cheese on the room service menu. I got a hankering for this mac & cheese so when we came to the restaurant to eat I expected it to be on the menu, however it was not. Guess what? They made it for me anyway. It was delicious.

No skimping here.  I would order it again. Pretzel appetizer - The cheese was great, but the pretzel was a pretzel bread and too dense.  I would not order this again. Steak & Eggs - Flat Iron steak was cooked perfectly and tasted great.  Eggs were cooked perfectly as well.  I would definitely get this again.  Chicken and waffles - The chicken was great.   The corn puree was excellent.   The waffles were good.  3 waffles and 2 pieces of chicken.   The jalapeno maple syrup is a little spicy. If you're not big eaters,  you can split it with a small side.    French toast - 4 pieces.   You can get a side dish and split everything.   It was OK.  I'd go with the chicken and waffles instead.",

    "text": "I realized I made a mistake in reserving a table at Frank & Albert's upon arrival. Their website makes it seem the restaurant is more upscale then it actually is. The place was full of people in swimming trunks and rubber flip flops. I was totally out of place in a simple cotton maxi dress (nothing fancy). The ambiance was no better than Olive Garden and the service was horrible. The only thing that matched a more upscale dining experience was the price of the food, which did not live up to the price.  Our waiter took over five minutes to even come to our table to offer water. Then he forgot my husband's beer. Then our entrees were clearly forgotten about for a while, because they came lukewarm. Then he forgot to bring the dessert menu. And the place was not crowded. From what I could tell, he was managing 2-3 tables.  For food, we got the smashed avocado, which was good. For our main entrees, we got the mushroom ravioli and the chicken panzanella. As I mentioned, both were lukewarm at best and I could tell from how the pasta looked that it was starting to dry out. The meals tasted okay, but certainly not worth the price of $21 and $25. When we finally were able to get a dessert menu, we chose the strawberry cheesecake. I chose it because of the added kumquats (I wanted to see what it was all about). Well, there were no kumquats on it -- just strawberries.   To add insult to injury, I made the reservation on OpenTable, which I've used countless times with other restaurants in the past with no problems. This time I received an email from OpenTable advising that I was a NO-SHOW and that now I have to request a review, otherwise my no-show will negatively impact my ability to make future reservations via OpenTable.   After dinner we took a stroll around the Biltmore's grounds and frankly, the entire place was a disappointment. Of course the architecture of the original buildings is amazing, but the landscaping is in horrible condition, the public restroom was filthy, and just not the overall five star Waldorf Astoria experience one would expect. The place just looks tired.",

It allowed us to have enough room for dinner. After debating all the enticing choices, I decided on the Chili Braised short ribs, that were served with Hayden Mills Grits, roasted poblano and tomato. Holy cow! Talk about upscaling meat and grits to another level. It was fantastic comfort food at a good price for the quality. The serving size was just right as well.   My teen daughter enjoyed her choice of the Chicken Pilard. She allowed me to take a bite and it was full of fresh flavors.  Five stars and two thumbs up!",

I called back TWO more times (at 15 minute intervals) and still NOBODY answered.  I called the concierge back AGAIN and asked to be connected to the restaurant manager and after being put on hold for FOUR minutes, he comes back to tell me I may not get through to the manager but I will get his voicemail.  Well THAT did not happen.  The Restaurant Manager has NO voicemail.  For a  hotel resort that touts itself on it's recording (while you are waiting forever on hold) to cater to the RICH and FAMOUS, you would think someone would ANSWER the phone at this restaurant after calling three separate times 15 minutes apart.  Maybe the hotel is short on staff.  I will call again tomorrow and see where I get.  I was just going to ask if the dinner menu that they posted online is all they have to offer or if there is more and if the one posted online is only an example of what there is to eat.  If this is all they have, it is a little light on choices and a lot of spicy food which may not appeal to everyone.  One star for me on this resort and if it weren't for the namesake of Frank Lloyd Wright, they would probably be out of business with this kind of service.",

Took some time to hold a conversation with us and recommended some things to do during our visit to Phoenix.   We also had questions about some of the dishes and Sherri gave us real 'get this, don't get that' answers which I really appreciate. Versus 'everything is great here'.

I want to say that Sherri is by far the best server (though there was a black guy who served us one morning that was also awesome!)  There isn't a huge menu here but still you can get pretty much any breakfest food like yogurt, eggs, omelets, pancakes or a buffet.  My husband tried the Mexican pizza and although it was good it did make him sick later in the day.  Each of my times here I had the decaf coffee and it was very good!  I had the omelette twice and another day the Sonoran benedict.  The Sonoron benedict probably was my favorite item- it had eggs benedict over a pulled pork and a nice tomato salsa.  The other day I had the almond cherry foccacia french toast and it was okay.  It was a huge slab of french toast smothered with almond butter.  It was just too rich for me.  I wasn't actually a huge fan of it but it was still okay to try.  I can't speak on Frank & Albert's for lunch or dinner, but if you are staying here it was quick service and the food came out quickly as well.",

It was perfectly fried not greasy at all with a side of  delicious cocktail sauce. I ordered a small organic caesar you get a choice of celery root or organic regular. I chose the celery and it was delicious, perfect portion. If you like more lettuce then get the regular caesar. Then I ordered the chicken and goat cheese desert flat bread pizza. It was more than I could eat but I sure tried to finish it. It was delicious nice moist chicken with the tang of the goat cheese and sweet figs. The desert flat bread was a nice alternative to a regular pizza dough. Great combination of ingredients. All in all a great experience! Katy was our server she was attentive but not breathing down our necks. I cant' wait to go back!",

Fascinating preparation, as it was served as a \"brick\" (imagine quartering a loaf of bread and then splitting it in half).  Had a honey drizzle, some luscious strawberries and real maple syrup.  Absolutely delicious.  My friend's omelet was equally as tasty.  Setting is gorgeous and service was good.  Only downside is resort pricing -- $11 for the (admittedly excellent) french toast and $4 for coffee (I passed).  Yum.",

The server was very slow and never asked us if we wanted refills on drinks, forgot an entire appetizer order and had to be found to pay the bill. The only really good thing on the menu was the onion rings. The Sea Bass was loaded with Salt, but otherwise dry. My daughters hamburger was not medium, but over done...hard as a rock. My wife's apple salad was mostly apples. We had to ask several times to get more bread and waited over an hour each time for our food. When we mentioned to the waiter that the appetizer order was completely forgotten, his response was \" oh sorry,\" with no offer of anything complimentary to make up for the error.  The service was possibly the worst I've ever had and my family is in the restaurant business and I've eaten at a multitude of places",

But the REAL issue was the service.  Not nearly enough staff on duty and those that were there were poorly trained.  We sat down at 6:30 pm with the dining area not nearly full and still waited over an hour for our meal.  Total time in the restaurant - 2 3/4 hours!  We were given the wrong menus, but the error was not caught until AFTER we had ordered.  When our meal was finally served we had no utensils to eat it with.  When we asked for them they were not brought, so we had to get up and steal them from a nearby table.  Nobody cared.  Remember, this is the BILTMORE!  Bus staff did not have a clue as to what they were there for - knocked things over and reached in front of us to clear the table.  We ordered wine with our entrees and it did not arrive until we asked the Manager to bring it half way through our meal.  Final insult was that the bill was wrong and had to be sent back for correction.  The waiter then had the nerve to give us a littany of excuses as to why things went so wrong when he brought the incorrect bill.  As I said, STAY AWAY.",

I have had the pleasure of eating here in large groups (15-20) and a smaller more intimate table (2-4). The service is usually quite good and the staff attentive. The staff all seem to know the menu and able to make recommendations. I think my favorite thing on the menu is the BLT Taco with Hibiscus BBQ sauce - it's yummy AND pretty! Last time I went there I was served by a lovely gal with purple hair. It made me happy to see that they're not so stuffy there that they turned her away (as someone with blue hair I'm always pleased to see that people don't think your hair color speaks to a person's character). The Biltmore doesn't have a whole lot of restaurant options on site, but this IS a good choice (both with food quality and pricing) so you don't have to stray off the hotel grounds when you're staying here!",

After we finally got our water ordered another server came over and asked if we had been helped yet knowing we had been sitting there for some time. We get our water still another few minutes later even though there was only 3 other tables in the whole place and we ordered the smashed avocado appetizer. It was not impressive. The chips are bland and the bowl of guacamole is tiny. After we finished that, our server asked if we would like to order dinner, so we ordered the house special (steak with fries), and the meatloaf. The steak was tiny with a tiny basket of fries, and the meatloaf was basically a giant hamburger with ketchup on top. The mashed potatoes that it says it comes with are a couple of spoonfuls under the meatloaf, so there isn't much. The service was no better than if we went to a fast food place and the food is not worth the $85 we spent on the 3 things we got. We could have gotten better food at a fast food restaurant for 1/4 of the price. When our server brought the check over she wouldn't let me write in our room number and last name since we are also staying at the hotel. She wrote it in for me as if I wasn't able to write it in myself or I wouldn't have paid the bill. We have been to plenty of nice restaurants that we are willing to pay more for and never have we been treated as young, poor couple who wouldn't pay. Never going back. I also would recommend others to not go if you want good service and good food. Since we are staying at the hotel, this is the place to get breakfast. We came to get the breakfast buffet, but we again waited to have a server come to our table to take our order. She didn't bring water or coffee for a bit of time, then took our plates after they were stacked 5 high and had been sitting there for almost our whole meal. She then brought our check without ever checking in to see if there is anything else we needed. We had asked for cream for our coffee and got a small cream for one person, but we both had coffee. When she left the check, I asked her for more cream so we both could have our coffee with cream and she didn't bring it. A busser ended up bringing it over and asked if we needed anything else, which is more customer service than we have gotten the whole meal. We are thoroughly uninterested in coming back here. It seems since we are young, we don't get service because everyone else around us is older and has gotten 10x he amount of service as us. Sorry but we are young and not tipping well because your service is terrible not because we are young and poor. We make plenty of money to leave you a great tip, but didn't because we tipped you what you earned. After our experience with breakfast being similar, but worse than our experience with dinner, I moved the rating from two stars down to one.",

Just always check it out first because he got the buffet yesterday and it had biscuits and gravy....which I was excited for today....but when I got up there to get them, it was a dish that looked really sad (not sure what it was honestly). The buffet has a great omelet & egg station, has a fantastic fresh fruit section and a wide variety of nice pastries. With all of that being said about the buffet....I have to point out my absolute favorite breakfast dish. The Huevos Rancheros is so good!!! We come from New Mexico where Huevos Rancheros is the \"King\" of breakfast...and I really have to say, that this HR is one of my favorites!! Now, it is really nothing like the NM Huevos Rancheros....it is completely different (very fresh), but so good. I highly recommend this establishment for breakfast!",

Second bad sign, the recommended smashed avocado appetizer (badly in need of seasoning) came a good 8-10 minutes before our cocktails (we ordered cocktails before we ordered our appetizer). Third bad sign, the appetizer was brought and two of our party still didn't have silverware or appetizer plates (we had to ask for them after we waited with the appetizer sitting in front of us for five minutes WITHOUT COCKTAILS). Fourth bad sign, the house specialty meatloaf was swimming in their 'homemade chipotle ketchup' that was sweet rather than spicy. Fifth bad sign, our waiter finally showed up to ask how everything tasted (we were starving so the diner food they served was adequate, not great, not horrible but simply adequate) when we were almost done and sorely in need of a second round of cocktails (which basically ended up being dessert). Don't get me wrong, all of the food was fine. But fine isn't good enough if you're charging $28 for 'signature' meatloaf that is absolutely nothing special. I'm from Chicago and hadn't been to the Biltmore in years so I was super disappointed in their casual restaurant. Let's hope our experience at the fine dining restaurant is much better, although I'm reconsidering our reservation after this diner, uh dining experience.",

The decor inside was underwhelming aside from the walls and exterior which is classic Frank Lloyd Wright style definitely the more \"family friendly\" restaurant. Service was fine fairly average nothing was blatantly bad. Now the question to buffet or not to buffet?? That was the question. After our entrees the buffet at $21 dollars would only be $4 or $5 dollars more so it probably would have been a better deal I just wasn't in the mood to have the valet use a crowbar to help me into the car. One person in the party had the buffet I took a peek and it looked fairly standard. I had the build your own omelette with ham and spinach, it was very average, certainly not bad but not great. The fingerling potatoes were good smothered in onions which I didn't care for, some potatoes very cooked others hardly cooked. My toast had a bit of a delay arriving at the table but no big deal. I added sausage which was very good. Another friend at the table had pineapple upside pancakes which were good but incredibly sweet. My partner had the prime rib hash, corn, chili rojo, peppers, potatoes and fried eggs. Salty but delicious! To summarize whether you are staying at the resort or not check out at least a restaurant or two there if anything for the history rather than the food.",

I knew the prices were high, but I was hoping the food would match. It did not.  I ordered the vegetarian omelet (+ goat cheese). It came with a side of fried potatoes and bread (I got an English muffin). The omelet was small, and the ONLY reason it was good was the goat cheese I requested. Otherwise it would've been bland AND unfulfilling. The potatoes (red and purple) were pretty tasty and well done, but since I'm eating low carb, I let my daughter enjoy them. Everything needed salt. The English muffin came out completely black on one side. That was the icing on the cake for me.   The salt and pepper on my table needed refilled. There was nothing in either. Fortunately we snagged a set form an empty table. The service was good.   Husband's salad came with a ginger dressing that was the texture and sweetness of jelly. really odd. And not tasty.   Overall, food was disappointing. Interior was clean and pretty. Service was nice. I wouldn't waste money on breakfast again though.",

Mind you, this is a Waldorf Astoria property!!! That being the case, you expect a certain level of service.   \"Service\" - Our server, Ken N. was disheveled, dirty uniform and had a flippant, dismissive manner. He never told us about the specials either. We later overheard another server letting her table know about specials. He never came back to see if we needed more water or anything else. We ordered cappuccinos and he didn't bring the sugar or spoons. We asked for them, he then brought the sugar, no spoons, we asked for spoons again... by the time we had what we needed, they weren't hot and my experience was tainted.   \"Food\" - The shrimp cocktail was really a joke. For 21.00, we assumed it would be 3-4 jumbo shrimp/prawns. There were 4 very small, grocery store-like shrimp on a plate. Husband's pizza was excellent and a good value. My caesar salad with salmon was excellent and a good value. The cappuccinos, aside from being warmish, weren't anything that I would expect from The Waldorf Astoria. Maybe it's just me, but I would expect some kind of presentation... maybe a small spoon and a cube of raw sugar, a small biscotti, a doily, lol.. something!   Disappointed at best. We didn't even have alcohol and our bill was 100.00. Had the service been adequate, the cost vs. everything else probably wouldn't have even registered with me.   ** Here's the scariest part ** Ken was training a new server!! He was talking really loud and authoratative so everyone on the patio could hear that he was training. God help her!!!",

We Went for Happy Hour Which they Have 3-6 EVERY Day- So We Were Able to make a 7:00 Res. & Went at 5:00 -5:30 to Have a Drink & Check Out Menu.  It was Great Choices at HH are Limited But Reasonable Select Drinks, Beers & Wine or $4-$5-$6 & Some Bites $5  The Meatloaf Sliders were Recommended & They Were Great !! Tasty!! For Dinner we Had the Ribeye Served with Cheesy Scalloped Potatoes Tomato & Asp. So it was a Whole Dinner for $40.  Along with a Shared Ceasar Salad.  Excellent Service by Lisa, and We Went for Broke & Shared a Cheesecake for Dessert.  Delish !!   We Are looking Forward to Going Back to this Beautiful Property.",

It is located within the Biltmore and they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. I think you will find the menu diverse and inviting with many tempting options. The service is good and the wait staff is attentive, knowledgeable and engaging.  The last time my wife and I ate here was for lunch in May. She had the crab cake sandwich and I ordered a blackened shrimp couscous salad. I also had a glass of the Caymus Conundrum - always very drinkable.  I tried my partner's crab cake sandwich and it was delicious. It included bacon, lettuce and tomato. The sea salt fries are one of my favorites. My shrimp couscous salad consisted of olives, cucumber, roasted tomato, beets with a nice vinaigrette. The shrimp were large and flavorful.   This restaurant is a good value for your dollar and worth checking out.",

Was disappointed to get to the host stand and an employee was cleaning a table nearby. After we were not greeted for a few minutes he said \"Have you been helped? No? There should be two hostesses up here, so they must be busy\". He then walked away and left us to wait. After a hostess finally showed up to seat us, she informed us our server, Maria, would be right with us. 10 or so minutes went by and we still had yet to be greeted by our server. I noticed a lady leaning on a counter with her back towards us doing nothing for a few minutes, having a strong suspicion she might be Maria. After she finally turned around and walked in our direction, I made eye contact in an attempt to get her attention, to which she responded \"Oh you're ready now?\". As she came to take our order, I saw her nametag, thus confirming my suspicion that she was, in fact our server. We had a simple order of water with no ice and a sandwich, nothing else, but the water came with loads of ice and she quickly dropped them off and left the table. We were enjoying the food (which she did not even bother to perform a quality check on, but luckily the kitchen did great) and were about halfway through with when she came by and dropped the check, once again walking away before giving us a chance to say anything. She must have assumed (without asking) we were charging it to the room, because even though we finished our food, she never returned to ensure we were actually billing it to the room instead of our card or cash. We were there to celebrate an anniversary and have a relaxing staycation, but the service experience really left much to be desired. I will not be returning, or let alone recommending this place to friends or family.",

    "text": "Was at the Biltmore Fashion Park and headed over to the restaurant based on local recommendations. It was not very good.  The food was bad and the service was worse. The self-proclaimed famous tortilla soup had little-to-no flavor and used canned vegetables.  I ordered a salad that was supposed to come with a vinaigrette but instead came with a thick creamy dressing that tasted like tangy ranch.  On to the service: after we were seated it took 10 minutes for an older blond waitress to even notice us and it wasn't even that busy! When she asked for our drink order, she seemed upset that I just ordered a lemonade, it was weird.  Then we asked for bread, which we never got. After she brought the check we reminded her and she was just like \"whoops\".  I imagine she is the sister of the owner or something.   She came back with bread that we were able to use to clear our palates of that awful meal.  Another negative is the price: soup and salad for two plus one lemonade cost us $60! For terrible tasting, poor quality food.  One positive is that the kitchen is fast. They got the orders to us right away.    So, if you are in the mood to be treated poorly and eat bad, expensive food, then this place is for you.  Otherwise stay away.",

My husband and I eat organically, so it was a delight to actually find a REALLY good restaurant that offers these options for people like us. The staff was absolutely delightful! They remembered our names, gave us exceptional service, and really made the whole experience just wonderful. The chef also came out and paid us a visit, which is always good in my book as you are never able to give the proper compliments to their hard work.  For breakfast, definitely try the eggs benedict! Their twist on it was a unique delight for someone who is an eggs benedict lover. They use a smoked pork loin vs a ham and their hollindaise was to die for!  For dinner, definitely try the bass. For cocktails, you MUST try the Lavender and Lemons martini. Lavender infused vodka with lemonade and candied violets.  The only thing I would request that they improve is their desserts. Two people in our party had their cherries jubilee and the bananas foster. Both felt more like ice cream with fruit vs the traditional (or even modified) application. It was a bit of a disappointment, but overall we were extremely pleased with this place!",

I actually had the same thing, since hers looked so delicious.  The Macaroni & Cheese was spectacular - I love trying it at nicer restaurants, and this one was in my top ten.

Started with the roasted tomato soup that tasted and had the mouth feel of diluted tomato paste. The meatloaf that I have enjoyed many times was just ok but the portion was much smaller than before. One of my companions stopped after two spoons of the soup and was also disappointed with the portion size of the meatloaf. Though incredibly uncrowded on a Saturday night the service was listless. And to boot when I got the check the server had added his gratuity without mentioning it to us. I am used to this latter practice for a party of 6 or more but we were only 4. I did complain to the manager but he did absolutely nothing!  If this represents the new Frank & Albert's its in serious trouble.  Permalink | Report | Reply",

    "text": "We visited Frank & Albert's on a Sunday afternoon for lunch.  Hardly anyone was there, as it was about 2:30 PM.  We had eaten lunch there a couple of years ago on the patio, and I had a great time then.  However, the temp was 114 on this particular afternoon, so the patio wasn't an option.  We were the only people in there other than the dude who talked on his phone the ENTIRE time we were there.  He even managed to order and eat his entire lunch while yapping.    I ordered fish tacos, as I had the last time we were there.  Something has changed.  A previous reviewer mentioned this, and he was on the money.  I received two constructed tacos . . .soft tortilla shells in the shaper with cabbage etc.  only no fish!  Two large-ish filets of fish were on the side!  It was really messy . . .I had to tear apart the filets with my fork, smash some fish into the full-of-cabbage tortillas, and complete my own taco :(  I gave up on the second one and ate the veggie taco and the fish separately.  I really didn't like the seasoning on the fish, either.  I thought it was too harsh and blackened.  Ultimately, the fish tacos were \"meh\" to say the most.  I will not order them again.  My bf ordered a sandwich and since he must follow a special diet, he cannot eat mayo.  He reads ingredients very closely and requests things he can't have be left off.  His sandwich came slathered in mayo, even though it wasn't mentioned on the menu as an ingredient.  When we looked around for our server, he was nowhere to be found.  So, while I munched on messy tacos, bf sat looking sad for the next 5-7 minutes until we finally saw the server and flagged him down.  That being said, the server was AWESOME about making the new sandwich sans mayo, and we even received an extra order of sweet potato fries with sea salt.  They were yummy!  And when you see their house \"chipotle ketchup,\" DO try it!  I looked for it in the Biltmore gift shop, but they didn't have any for sale.  Oh well.    I am not swearing Frank & Albert's off forever, but since I am only in Phoenix a few times a year, it will be a while before I go again.",

The portions are big and the price is more than reasonable.  A wonderful experience.",

    "text": "The breakfast here was amazing - wonderful oatmeal with cherry brulee.  The breakfast buffet was also excellent.  However, I give this restaurant two stars because of the dinner we had the night prior to the great breakfast.  The signature lemon lavender martini was very disappointing, as they were fresh out of lavender so they brought me a basic lemon drop martini.  The waiter highly hyped the lemon chicken that came with the \"best mashed potatoes he'd ever had\", so I ordered that.  The chicken (which was claimed to have been marinated in lemon all night long) had zero lemon taste to it.  Zero.  It was simple rotisserie chicken - good flavor but not what it claimed to me.  The mashed potatoes - I took one bite and without saying anything about them I had my fiance taste them.  His reaction was, \"they taste like instant potatoes\", which was exactly my thought!!!!!!  I was stunned since they were so hyped.  If I stay at the Biltmore again I definitely would not eat dinner here - I would try the nicer restaurant on the property or go off property.",

He also knew a lot of great stories about the resort. There were a lot of interesting choices on the menu. I'm usually not much of a drinker, especially mixed drinks, but I was in the mood, so I tried The Spritz (very manly, I know). It was decent, but not great, especially for a $15 drink. As for the food, I went with the Sonoran Pizza, which was unique and quite tasty. My daughter tired a different pizza, the Southwest Traditional, and she ate the whole thing! My wife enjoyed the tortilla soup with the Sonoran Caesar salad, wile my other daughter tried the soup with the hummus appetizer. We were all pretty stuffed by the end, but the dessert menu was pretty attractive too. After some deliberation, I swayed the vote to the Tableside S'mores - definitely the right choice! If you are staying at the Biltmore, I would definitely recommend that you pay a visit to Frank & Albert's!",

    "text": "Stayed at the Biltmore for 4 nights during the off-season and went here three times.   The first time I went was for happy hour as they have a reasonably priced menu. Had a beer, some wine, and guac. It was good.   The second time was for dinner as Wright's didn't have space for us. We got some drinks and ordered wings and pizza. It was better than I thought it would be.   Where both times struggled was the service. There was a bartender who was working both times (I can't remember her name. I think it started with a B). Her service was great. She was friendly and working hard. She was working extremely hard as she was bartending while also serving all the tables near the bar. It would take a few extra minutes to get in an order and get drinks, but no fault of her own. I simply think someone should have been staffing the seating area. This could be a result of it being offseason, but the hotness should be able to help out when not seating people.   The third time we came in for breakfast. It was pretty good. I particularly remember the home fries. I remember them so vividly because they were good. I say this because it can be so easy to make bland home fries and under-season them. They were seasoned so well that non-condiment was needed.   All in all, good HH, food is better than you might expect, though expect a little higher price, and the service could be better organized.",

    "text": "Taking days off are a rare occasion for me.  Very long lunches? Yes. Leaving early? Most definitely. Holiday weekends? Guaranteed.  Taking a whole day off, with no plans and no work? Preposterous!  It was a beautiful spring day, and I decided to take the day off to enjoy the beautiful weather. I took the convertible out of storage and braved  the endless throngs of people out there.  Poor souls. They were rushing to work. While I was simply driving around looking for a place to enjoy a nice quiet breakfast, in stellar surroundings.  There's no better place to enjoy such a marvelous day than the Arizona Biltmore - one of Arizona's hallmark destinations.  As I pulled into the entrance, I was warmly greeted by the duo of Valets eager to park my car. It is always so refreshing to be greeted by folks that enjoy their jobs, and it showed on their faces.  I walked through the entrance, made a right, and instead of going to my typical destination here (Wright's restaurant), I went to Frank & Albert's.   This establishment was definitely bustling with golfer's and other guests that morning. Nearly every seat was taken, but since I was running solo, they didn't have any difficulty in promptly seating me.  As I was perusing their menu, I had great view of their open view kitchen. It appeared to be well run and efficient.  Speaking of efficient, I had no less than 3 servers check on me on a regular basis. There was nary a moment wherein I was outside of anyone's view or care. They certainly proved that they take breakfast seriously here.  Speaking of breakfast, I opted for one of the heavier dishes on the menu. I had a long day, and I didn't want to be distracted by pangs of hunger by the time mid-afternoon rolled around. I scheduled a last minute major medical visit, and I was already anticipating that this was going to be a long day, devoid of any fun or sustenance, even if it was my day off.  Nonetheless, my day started off well at Frank & Albert's. I chose the Blackened Steak, accompanied by Over Easy Eggs, and potatoes.   The Blackened Steak was quite juicy. I detected a hint of tartness with the sauce that enveloped it. Yet, it still was delicious and satisfying. I will note that I wasn't entirely a fan of the mushrooms that were laid on top of the steak. I am not a fan of raw mushrooms. They were covered in the tart sauce, but it didn't cover up the sooty taste of the raw mushrooms.  The eggs, on the other hand, had a marvelously prepared exterior, with a very tasteful yolk that is sure enrich one's bad cholesterol count. However, bad cholesterol is not my issue.  The red, steamed potatoes were delightfully prepared. The interior was both soft and moist. I enjoyed the crisp skins and their salty taste.  Along with the stellar service, and the great food, the view of the grounds made for a wonderful breakfast dining experience at this resort. It was a great way to open a day off that maybe wouldn't have been so great otherwise.",

    "text": "This review is long over due.  I love the Biltmore. The hotel is a gorgeous hotel with a history. I could easily sit at the bar or lounge all day and just look at the architecture.  I have done many stay vacations here but as a local I never think to simply come and dine here. There are so many choices and great restaurants in Phoenix.   If a resort/hotel brand like the Waldorf has a restaurant onsite. (Which they are required to for their star rating) , if they are going to spend the money to keep it modern, spend the money to attract guests. Wouldn't you think In this day and age with Yelp/trip advisor and other review sites, that this type of High-Elegant resort/hotel brand would be smart to not only capture the attention of its guests and their money. Money that their guests will be naturally be spending to eat. (We all must eat) but that also the Waldorf would create a restaurant to attract the hotels neighbors and the locals who frequent the restaurants around them.   Walking into the hotel via The free Valet, walking through the hotel to Frank and Alberts. To have a non aggressive marketing sign of upcoming events in the restaurant, then to walk into a nice bar, friendly smiling reception, bartender. To be greeted and thanked for coming in by every waiter I walk by. To have the manager being charming with her staff as we approached and then also receive that same charm in her greeting is an absolute wow factor. As proud Yelp elites; We started taking names immediately!  Ken was our server. Handsome, friendly and exceptional forward thinking service.  Absolutely would return and ask for him to be our server. The manager Mina is absolutely professional and again exceptional and engaging. The hostesses were welcoming. The whole staff seem to genuinely greet us and that is nice and personalizes our experience.  The deconstructed tamale, the crushed avocado are tasty. The meatloaf, burger and steak are perfection.  The mini desserts are fun and done well.  Omg... the cheese/jalapeno bread is mouth watering.   They have beer with food tasting (local breweries)  Can't wait to try those and can't wait to bring my friends and colleagues.   Good job Biltmore. Great staff, great food in an absolutely cool historical hotel.   Two thumbs up!",

Reservations set up from Ocatilla lounge with a concierge - none of her reservation notes were ever brought up.   We were seated immediately and at a nice table.  However the couple behind my wife has some pretty fresh language for a Waldorf restaurant and we almost asked to be reseated.  We aren't prudes we just don't appreciate F this and F that at a nice restaurant, save that for your local bar.     Our wine order took a long time as my Pinot had been put in a normal fridge and was 35 degrees.  They didn't want to serve it but also didn't want to replace it, they wanted me to wait for it to warm up.   Crazy right?  Wait for wine?  Things got better the food was very good.  My wife's steak was spot on for temp and vey tender.  Balsamic glaze was interesting.  I didn't like it but my wife was trying to figure out how to replicate it at home.  The meatloaf was a very large portion and wasn't dry like some can be.   The fried onions on top made a nice crunch to go with the softness of the meatloaf.   Great beef flavor too.   The prices for the wine were a tad high. $25 for a 9'oz pour.   We had $100 in wine for 2 glasses each.  Yikes.   We need to learn to like the same wine.",

    "text": "As I mentioned in my review for the resort this place is found in I am generally surprised with the lack of dining options that match the scale of the resort. Yes, this place is actually deceivingly big but I can also imagine that under the wrong circumstances it might be impossible to get in.  For a breakfast and dinner experience this was thankfully not the case either time. Breakfast was the Huevos rancheros and they were really very good. For dinner the Freshly Smashed Avocado -- GF Customize your smashed avocado and crispy corn chips with these ingredients: Pico de Gallo, Mango Pico, Chopped Bacon, Queso Fresco, Toasted Pepitas and the AZ Prime Ribeye Steak  -- GF Aged Cheddar Potato Au Gratin, Grilled Asparagus, Roasted Tomato, Red Wine Demi-Glace were surprisingly good experiences.  Overall, there are better options off site and nearby -- however, if that is too much to do Frank & Albert's is an extremely good backup plan.",

    "text": "This is a beautiful restaurant located inside The Arizona Biltmore. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. We tried breakfast and dinner and both were excellent.  Breakfast - They serve buffet as well as A la Carte. Buffet is $28 and has an extensive choice of continental as well as hot items including omelette station.  We didn't do buffet. They also have a kids menu and my boys loved the waffles and chocolate chip pancakes. I had the Garden Egg white omelette which was cooked to perfection, all the veggies inside were so crunchy.  Happy hour - They have daily happy hour from 2-6 pm. They also do historic tours of the estate during happy hour.  Dinner - Lovely ambience for dinner, great service. If you are here during weekend, highly recommend making reservations. I tried the mushroom ravioli served over red pepper coulis and topped with balsamic reduction. Was absolutely one of the best vegetarian dishes I tried. Hubby tried grilled chicken panzanella served with vegetables, burrata mousse and balsamic jus. Kids menu has all the regular things kids like.  Wine menu is excellent and they have some great wines under $10",

For lunch, I ordered the hummus which not only was tasty, but beautifully displayed. My companions both ordered BLT Tacos, and loved them. We shared an order of House Fries, tasty fries covered with parmesan and herbs.   For breakfast the next day, I went simple with a bagel and fruit. Sadly, my bagel was a bit burned but the fruit perfect. One companion ordered the California Breakfast Sandwich which looked AMAZING, the other companion got the Chocolate Chip Pancakes which also looked tasty.   There are seats inside, outside, and in an enclosure. You are sure to find a table that suits your mood!",

He got back to me via email and then set up a phone call for us to chat.   He was extremely pleasant, understanding, and generous over the phone; offering to issue us a full refund for our dinner that evening. In addition to the refund, he also mentioned he would take care of us the next time we were in town so we could get the real Frank & Albert's experience.  It's never fun to have a let down of an expensive holiday dinner but when the GM calls you personally to apologize, issue a full refund, and invite you back in to see the restaurant to hopefully see it in a new light, things can turn around pretty quickly.   Thank you, Aaron! Look forward to meeting you in person and seeing what F&A's has to offer! :)",

    "text": "So-so for dinner. Very good for breakfast experience (last paragraph).  First, we had a reservation for 5pm & were seated in a back room (that was empty at the time), it felt like being seated at the kids table, or being in detention, or something weird like that.  Maybe I'd be OK if I did not have a reservation, but regardless, it would be nice of the host to mention something instead of just walking us by the main (cool kids', nicer) dining area.  This room had something I had never seen, by one of the walls there was like a server's station with soda machine and all that. Very cozy, lol.  Second, I do not how restaurants operate, I am not in that industry, but we were not very interested in the items in the menu and asked if there was a special. We were told there was probably going to be one but that is not ready until like 5:20ish... so we decided to wait. (their website says dinner starts at 5pm)  Turns out the special was salmon (that my hubby does not like), so we went back to perusing the menu. We both went for the Ribeye, which is usually my first option, and we both kind of regretted it.  I order mine rare, hubby orders his medium.  They arrive. Mine is super thin (and smaller) compared to his. Bad sign, that usually means it will be overcooked. Common sense dictates to use the thicker one for rare/medium, and thin one for well done (I have heard most people order well done in Arizona). They also are covered with a dark, sweet sauce. Not my cup of tea.  Of course, my steak was way overcooked. I waited and waited, and then had to ask someone to get our server so I could see if they could get me another one. By the time my server came back (he had checked on us right after our meals were delivered, but did not wait for us to cut into our steaks), hubby was more than half done with his meal.  Server took my plate back to get me a fresh steak.  Which, if you have read my other reviews, this is my opinion about that: \"Oh, so your steak was not cooked to your liking? sorry about that, let me now punish you by taking your whole plate, steak, sides and all, so you can (as awkwardly as possible) observe your dining companions enjoy their meals while you have nothing to nibble on\" (dramatization).  OK, so they offered to get me a new one... that is good, right?  In the mean time, hubby shared a bit of his steak with me... which was also overcooked, and not only that, visibly charred. Him, being less of a spoiled brat than me (or maybe because I pick up the bill, lol) said it was OK and he was going to eat it like that. I kid you not, that steak was so charred and burned that I got a bitter aftertaste in my mouth for a while. But, he did not complain, so no bad marks to the restaurant for not addressing it.  So my new steak arrives, & as I took a bite it tasted a bit funny... but I had already made a tantrum (not really, but you know what I mean)... so I just kept eating without saying anything... When half done the weird taste got worse & I did not finish my steak. Did you read that? I did not finish my steak. I do not think that had ever happened before. I may not finish a dessert, but a steak? unthinkable. Hubby was visible concerned, lol, so I had to explain. He tasted it & thoroughly agreed that something was very wrong with that steak. So we mentioned to our server, & as I got worried about getting sick or something, we asked to speak to a manager. A manager stopped by & the only thing he could think of is that they apparently smoke the steaks & that could be the reason. But we had already tasted 2 other steaks that did not have that flavor, & I kind of know what smoked meats taste like... but oh well.  Anyhow, the manager listened to my concerns & although I did not enjoy my dinner at all, at least they seemed to care & tried to address it.  So... yeah, that was not a nice experience at all. Not rushing to go back for dinner there.  However, we were staying at the Arizona Biltmore (summer rates to blame) & were not about to pay $50/person for brunch at Wright's (with this bad experience, lol)... so we ended up coming back for breakfast... & although I think the breakfast buffet is a bit overpriced for what it is... we had a way better experience. Considering that the breakfast items are I think $17+, $30/person including beverage for buffet was not that terrible & at least we checked out the options first, so no much room for surprises : P Joaquin was super friendly at the omelette station, he did a great job with our main dishes. And our server, oh my, I don't remember her name. It starts with a Z & I think has a K, if anyone knows the name please send me a note because she was awesome. We had very meaningful interactions & she was very prompt to assist us with everything we needed. Our dinner server was OK, he did try to connect but I think being on the back room was a factor because we felt a little neglected.  PS Dinner fries were great!  Next thing I am going to write letters to the editor!",

    "text": "3.5 Stars  Frank & Albert's is located inside the Arizona Biltmore.  As a result, the prices are sky high.  But it's one of the very few food options within walking distance of the hotel, so they can afford to charge a lot and still maintain their customer base.  My husband and I ate breakfast here because it was convenient (we were staying at the hotel) and we needed a quick bite to eat.  I had the breakfast wrap which unfortunately was a bit bland, and the fingerlling potatoes that were inside the wrap were a bit underdone (too firm).  It's hard to forgive screwing up such a simple thing.  However, the saving grace was my husband's french toast.  It looked very unassuming when it arrived at the table as a small-ish, rectangular loaf.  The serving size seemed a bit stingy for the price.  But my husband proclaimed it to be the best french toast he's ever had.  That's quite a compliment coming from a guy who is pretty critical of food and doesn't get especially excited about food in general.  But I had to agree that it was pretty damn good.  Even the fruit it came with was perfectly ripe and sweet.  If my wrap had been more flavorful and fully cooked, I wouldn't have minded so much that we paid $40 for breakfast for two people (and we didn't pig out).  But I think next time (if there is a next time) that I stay at the Biltmore, I'll plan to drive somewhere to get a more affordable breakfast.",

We had reservation but for a Friday nite, it wasn't really needed.   For drinks, I tried the Lavendar & Lemon martini. Frankly, I barely tasted the lavendar and didn't taste any citrus or lemon at all. Don't think I'll get that again.   I ordered the onion rings for appetizer & one order was enough for 2 to share. Prime rib was cooked perfectly. Came with baked potato and broccoli but we had to ask for sour cream for the baked potato. The Meatloaf was a little different from any meatloaf I've ever had, served on top of pinto beans and spinach. At first glance it didn't look appetizing but it was very moist and flavorful. I would've liked gravy or a sauce to make it more complete but I would order it again as it is. Pumpkin creme brulee for desert was more like pudding than the custard I expected but it was also very good.   The atmosphere was relaxed and happy. Lighting was low. We had to wait for our eyes to adjust to the candle light before we could read the menu. I heard a few people at a table near us ask for more candles so they could see the menu!   Service was awesome. We never had to wait for anything and the waiter was always available (but didn't hover) as well as friendly & informative. We never felt rushed and the waiter didn't drop the check til we asked for it. Would definitely come back again.   Prices are what you'd expect from a high-end resort restaurant with great food, excellent service and wonderful atmosphere. After all. that's what you're actually paying for when you order that $30 prime rib dinner, right?   Valet parking is free if you tell them you're eating at the restaurant.",

We were treated to dinner here last night by boyfriend's visiting aunt and her S.O.  - The atmosphere was very nice; we sat in the room with the \"Great Glass Fireplace\" in the center and floor-to-ceiling windows all around, with a view of the fountain. - They offered local craft beer selections (including Nimbus, Oak Creek and Four Peaks - yay!) at a reasonable $6. - Extensive dessert menu; none of this 4 or 5 choices, this thing was a whole page by itself. - The dark chocolate brulee was (I should say is, I'm eating the leftovers right now) AMAZING. Sugar burnt perfectly, like when you toast the edge of a marshmallow, rich dark chocolate, raspberries. So good!  Negatives: - Menu was pretty limited - fine dining restaurants are usually limited, but not with a bunch of relatively boring options; their limited offerings usually  have enough interesting twists that you can find SOMETHING that jumps out at you. Not here. Fried chicken and mac and cheese and meatloaf? Odd.  - My entree (the trout) and boyfriend's (pasta with shrimp) were just OK. The trout and shrimp were cooked nicely but the flavors lacked something. Maybe more lemon on mine? It did refer to it as \"braised lemon\"... - Service was a little awkward - the waitress asked if she could start us off with some waters and we all said \"Uh... sure?\"  It wasn't the water offering, it was that it was like she was selling us on the waters instead of real drinks. She didn't seem to really know anything about the menu either - she went around the table and her description of each of our orders was that they were very good or really popular. I was amused that she was treating me as the \"Alpha 'of the table - guess I was intimidating, heehee. - $6 for a domestic draft is pushing it, especially with craft beers being the same price. - Bathrooms are light years and eons away, OUTSIDE of the restaurant. Weird.",

The accompanying potatoes au-gratin were bland bland bland and gritty.  Fried chicken was also rather bland, and the accompanying mac-n-cheese was dry.  The highlight was 1/2 ounce of complimentary kalamata olive aioli with the cold bread before the meal.  Everything else was mediocre.  Bland.",

It felt really hip to be at the famous Arizona Biltmore, in all its Art Deco glory, but the meal we had here was overpriced and nothing to write home about.  I had a chef's salad, upon another Yelper's recommendation that it was \"the best she had ever had\" and was thoroughly disappointed.  It was lackluster, and seemed as though the ingredients came out of a can.  After a sub-par meal, stroll the grounds and you won't be as upset that you got a little ripped off at the restaurant.",

Wow, sure, I'll try that too!

Luved the bar bites sharing plates - totally YUM!  wow!  Duck, pork, turkey meatballs, tomotoe soup shooters, i forget what else, but i do intend to go back and try some more - they were excellent.  I did find it strange that along the bar, in the middle, they had this lower seating area, which was really weird - for wheelchairs?  it was strange looking down at people who kept sitting there.  They were introducing new menus and wine lists, so memorial wknd was super duper busy, which meant our service was not very prompt, but i can tell it was just one of those nites where it was out of the ordinary - there general standards look way above the normal, so i would like to visit again when it isn't as crazy there.",

    "text": "This is a review of Happy Hour only.   First let me say, I went with a large group of about 30 people, and our waitress did an awesome job! She put everyone on their own checks, and was super efficient, so I would definitely return if only for that reason. The atmosphere is nice and the chairs are comfortable, and they even have a few booths.   The drink specials for their specialty cocktails are the best deal, they are all around $5. The Prickly Peartini is probably one of the best drinks I have ever had, it was not too sweet and not too tart, just delicious and refreshing. The reason I only give them 3 stars is the food, I just wasn't blown away. They have these appetizer boards where you pick 4 options out of a list of 8 items, and each board is $5. Sounds good right? Well, the choices sound delicious, but the portion sizes are very, very small, these boards are not meant to be shared. I selected the potato skin for one of my options, and I was expecting a standard size skin that you normally get at a restaurant, but that is not what I got. My potato skin was maybe 1/2 inch wide and 2 inches long, it was the smallest potato skin I have ever seen! It is like they used a scrap peel from a potato to make it. While it was good, but potato + cheese + bacon isn't hard to mess up, I really feel I got a bit of the shaft. I also tried the meatloaf slider (decent, but needed a sauce) the grilled cheese bite (dry bread and nonexistent cheese) and the tomato soup shooter (really smoky, I didn't even finish it).   While I think the concept is good, the appetizer boards are all looks and no substance. Some of the other people at the table ordered the Chicken Lollipops, the baked brie and the onion rings, which were also just $5 per plate and looked to be really good and better portioned. I would definitely give Frank & Albert's a try again, but I would steer clear of the appetizer boards.",

My fried buffalo chicken sandwich was not fully cooked in the middle and the fried mac & cheese app was barley warm and a little soggy.  The kitchen staff seemed irritated that I sent the chicken back - they have an open kitchen so I could see the reaction of the chef when my waitress returned the chicken.  The restaurant was not busy on the Saturday afternoon that I visited, but the hostess was MIA when my party arrived.  We waited for about five minutes before I asked a server in the dinning room to get the hostess to seat my party and the party that had arrived before us.  Really not acceptable.  Our waitress, however, was very friendly and attentive.  I'm a local, so I won't be returning to Frank & Albert's; I think the only people that eat here are those staying at the resort, convenience is really the only reason to go here.",

The bacon quality was not great and it was swimming in inches of grease the fruit looked bad. For $24 it was worth about $10. For $30 make your way to the Four Seasons Scottsdale for the weekend buffet and you will be blown away double the size with great specialty items. The view alone is worth the drive.

The sour in it should be switched to a house made simple syrup for a more fresh taste.

I was extremely offended. Do we appear to be people who don't tip well? Well, I tip minimum 20%.I have worked in the industry and appreciate people who are in the service industry.

More than the kids could carry. Plenty of photo ops. Parents who weren't acting out scenes from Soylent Green.) we made our way to this nicely upscale coffee shop/casual dining spot.   We were seated 30 minutes ahead of our reservation, keeping my little guy from popping a gasket. I chose the $19 breakfast buffet, and considering it included a custom-made omelette with organic ingredients--as well as juice and coffee--it was a steal.   Service was wonderful and the staff was sure to make us feel at home. Well, actually better than home because I don't have people looking after my every whim and need while at home.",

    "text": "Amazing!  We stayed at the Biltmore over Christmas with an all-inclusive package.  With this package we were able to try a large variety of items on the menu.  The staff was incredibly friendly and recognized us by the 2nd day.  The first day we started off with the smashed avocados.  Great flavor - def not boring!  We also tried the pulled pork empanadas.  Not too much flavor, but not bad either.  During our stay we tried the pizza (late night and the pie was HUGE), the Burger (awesome taste) and the chicken and goat cheese flat.  All were very well prepared and had great flavor.  So maybe the reason the cheese pizza was incredible was because it was after cocktails, but really not bad for a resort.  Definitely need to try the FF prepared in duck fat.  We tried this one and the sea salt fries.  They were both good, but the duck fat fries had just that little something extra.  We ate Christmas dinner at F&A's also.  Very good again.  The best part was the table-side smores!    Overall our experiences were wonderful!  Even though most of our meals were eaten here, there is still more on the menu I'd like to try.",

I'm picky about chicken and this was excellent quality and delicious rotisserie chicken they used.  The combo of the other ingredients (lettuce, tomato, egg, avocado, bacon, and black olives) along with the green goddess dressing was superb.  It was a beautiful presentation too!  My dining companions' meals looked amazing as well.  I saw the Biltmore Bistro Burger, the Grilled Fish Tacos, and the B.A.L.T. (their Tuesday Blue Plate Special).  We devoured pretty much everything on the table too...  The service was a tad on the slow side but it was also a packed restaurant.  I will have to return for breakfast, dinner, and/or happy hour too as all of their menus look outstanding.  The bar/drinks menu alone has something for everyone with economy friendly prices.  If you have not yet been to the Arizona Biltmore, this new restaurant is reason to go... and since this year marks the Biltmore's 80th Birthday, there is a ton of history in the resort as well.",

    "text": "I love the Biltmore; Frank & Albert's? No so much.    Dinner this past Saturday night was, in a word, disappointing.  I had previewed their menu on line and was looking forward to the pork belly entree.  Alas, when I arrived and looked at the menu, no pork belly.  The waiter was very apologetic and let me know that it had been removed - 2 months ago! Oh well, so it goes...I settled for the seafood risotto, which was pretty much a bowl of mush adorned with so so shellfish and a tough slab of whitefish.  The margaritas were the highlight of the visit.  Sunday brunch held better possibilities- the BLT was advertised as featuring not only bacon, lettuce and tomato with a tasty sounding onion marmalade, but also slices of pork belly! The presentation, including a stainless steel basket of delicious French fries, was so appetizing that I did the food porn thing and snapped a pic to share with my foodie daughter.  The bun appeared to be a delight from the oven, but unfortunately turned out to be quite stale and inedible.  When asked \"who was everything\" by my very sweet waitress, I pointed out the rock hard puck on my plate and let her know that while the stuffing was great, the bun was not. I overheard her report to the kitchen, but that was the end of the discussion.  Oh well, once again.  Because Wright's is not open for Sunday dinner, it was back to F&A's once again.  I enjoyed the spare ribs - obviously slowed cooked with intense and very enjoyable flavors.  One out of three ain't bad, I guess...  Make that one out of four.  I went back for breakfast this morning (I, know, I must be a glutton for punishment or just a knucklehead!) with my sister.  You are not going to believe this, but they had porky belly and scrambled eggs on the menu - pig heaven for me, right? No so quick!  The waiter looked at me funny and told us he thought they were belly-less.  This absolutely cracked up my sister (who had been at the similarly belly-less dinner Saturday night). Sure enough, he checked with the kitchen and no bellies. Whatever...  Next time I'm at the Biltmore, I'm getting off the property and finding my own bellies!",

For that I ate nachos with chicken, three beers and two shots of high end booze.  Was it worth it? Depends.   I'll probably never go back because I live far away.

    "text": "It's ironic that this restaurant is named after a great architectural team because Frank and Albert's suffers a fatal design flaw. The glass-enclosed dining room doesn't have any shades to block out the blinding Arizona sun. This has to be a problem that has been brought to management's attention before. I cannot believe they haven't installed anything to protect their customers' retinas.  We had a bridal shower in that room, and all the people who had the misfortune of facing the windows spent the afternoon with their hands shading their eyes and wearing sunglasses.  Very uncomfortable and unpleasant experience.  As for the food, the bread and french fries are great. I'm a big fan of the chipotle ketchup that's on the table. However, I was really disappointed with the casear salad. The kitchen's interpretation of the classic is to add a shit-ton of celery. Yuck. My tofu entree was good. The green beans with it were really delicious and fresh. Dessert was a disaster. I got soy ice cream which I normally enjoy, but I'm pretty sure the abomination that was served to me had been sitting in the freezer for at least a year.   Two of our servers, Sherri and John, were outstanding. They were so friendly and welcoming.",

    "text": "Dined here twice during my stay at the Biltmore - dinner and breakfast. Both were delicious.   Dinner They serve complimentary bread with dinner. Its an Italian style white bread with garlic in it, served with honey pecan goat cheese spread. Both are delicious on the their own but imo, sweet goat cheese doesn't really go with garlic bread.   I ordered the Cesar salad with salmon (Not listed on the menu, they charge you $10 for the salmon which I thought was a bargain). The salmon was pan seared and cooked beautifully. They have a garlic-Cesar dressing and it is out of this world! My only  critiques are that the croutons are a little underwhelming. I'm not sure if they make them in house, but they seemed boxed. Also, there was too much cheese in the salad.   Breakfast I order the ricotta flap jacks. They are served with (a huge scoop) of vanilla bean butter, blueberry compote and maple syrup. Very good! The flap jacks are light and fluffy and a nice change from regular old pancakes. They also happily swapped out the compote for fresh berries upon request.   I tried some of their regular pancakes and these were really good too - a huge portion too.   If you order coffee, they'll leave a huge pot at the table.   I'm a little cautious of resort restaurants-sometimes they're overpriced and don't deliver but this place is awesome! The food is good and the menu is diverse. The prices are reasonable.  I would definitely recommend this place.",

I suspect if you dug Marilyn up today, her condition may resemble the current state of the Biltmore.  We thought it might be fun to go have lunch at the hotel.  I wasn't starving which was great because the menu is seriously lackluster and resembles what you'd see at one of these local semi-chain casual dining beer restaurants.  We walked in and got a nice stare down from the bartender as we navigated our way through the bar to the hostess station.  Despite the fact there were hardly any customers, it took forever to seat us at a dirty table.  The hostess disappeared to find cleaning supplies so we had a chance to study our dirty menus.  After about ten minutes, she appeared with sour smelling rag in hand to wipe our table.    Now that what little appetite I had was gone, I tried the small Waldorf salad or should I say dressing with some wilted greens.  If the dressing had been spicy as promised, I may have eaten a little but it wasn't so I didn't.  My husband had the tortilla soup and it came out lukewarm - he tried a spoonful and walked to the front to get our check. I'm guessing the soup was lukewarm because it probably sat ready for service for the half an hour it took to deliver.   Maybe I didn't read this place correctly and it's only meant to be a kind of 19th hole, beer drinking, nacho eating low end spot....",

Just recently, they reopened their doors with a renovation, so I was eager to revisit to see if it was the same or better then it was before. The answer is...both the same and better!  I'll first start with the decor. The new decor is nice. It's trendier and newer and not just your typical diner experience anymore. They created a sun room of sorts, so you can eat inside with the feel of outside but you won't have to worry about the weather since you're actually inside! The patio remains the same with new and improved patio furniture and the fire place (my favorite part) still remains!   Now on to the food. The food is much like the original food, but has some new improvements. I went with the sandwich and holy moly bread. I think it was about a loaf of bread in one sandwich but no necessarily a bad way! A cone full of sweet potato fries accompanied the sandwich and were the perfect mix. The sandwich was too large to eat in one sitting but each bite was tastefully delightful! When I got my meal, they provided me with normal ketchup and Frank and Albert's house made ketchup. I gave the house made ketchup a chance just to see what it was like but unfortunately it didn't quite live up to Heinz expectations.",

    "text": "Went to Frank & Albert's with my parents for a last-day-of-vacation breakfast and was literally shocked by how poor the experience was. We were seated quickly by the hostess who provided menus, and then waited at least 10 minutes to be acknowledged by anyone else ... no \"I'll be right with you\", no water, no coffee, no taking of our order. Once we finally did order, we waited another 10 minutes for our coffee which was delivered with cream but no sugar - after asking for it from the waitress, he was halfway through eating before she actually brought it.  The food arrived relatively quickly, delivered without a word by a guy from the kitchen. It was extremely hot and delicious. I had ordered a side of bacon which was not delivered. When the waitress finally brought the sugar, I asked for my bacon which then took another 15 minutes to arrive, once we were all pretty much done eating - and it was disgusting. It was brittle, dry, and tasted of chemical, like sterno. My parents both tried it and agreed ... I would have sent it back (it was $5.65 for 4 pieces), but at that point we just wanted to finish and leave.  The main issues I observed: The hostess seated folks as they came in and then did *nothing* else, just sat at her station in the middle of the room. There was one waitress serving all tables (5 total when we were there) - and was also the bartender. In order to access the bar, she had to walk around a hallway and in through a door behind the bar - an inefficient setup for someone needing to go back and forth. She was not well organized and could have used help - the hostess can't bring waters? Coffee? Also frustrating was the wait staff that came over from the other restaurant (they are connected) ... 2 additional waitresses that sauntered in and out, chatting and drinking water/coffee, while patrons waited without. Someone needs to seriously overhaul the game plan at Frank & Albert's.  The single star is because the food (except bacon) was delicious - the orange-ricotta pancakes were especially memorable.",

    "text": "It had been a really long day and being that we were staying at the Biltmore here in Phoenix the mecca of great restaurants we decided to stay in and give Frank and Alberts a whirl. The design and decor of the place was straight out of Frank Lloyd architecture handbook, which made sense as the place is named after him and he did design the Biltmore. Anyhow...this place was just okay. Not great, not bad, but more like right in the middle. We had the onion rings, chopped caesar salad and the meatloaf. All of them were tasty. However, they were just average. Being in a resort it was a little pricey, but not too pricey.",

    "text": "Stopped in for an awesome beer dinner last night at Frank & Albert's. They were featuring the Stone Brewing Co with this meal, one of my faves so we had to partake. Very decently prices, $45/person for a 5 course meal. Chef Jon was hosting the meal, and he knocked it out of the park. We were greeted in the room but the servers, Chef Jon, and the Stone Brewery rep, and this HUGE charcuterie table, covered with dried fruits, meats from all over, amazing cheese (the mango cheddar was the best!), and all kinds of crackers and bread. We were enjoying it so much and listening to Chef Jon tell us all about his selections to pair with the beer that we nearly filled up on the cheese and meat. Each course was paired perfectly with the beer they were featuring. Chef Jon explained each course perfectly and added the highlights of where the product came from, most everything was locally grown, very cool! The main course was the whole roasted pig that was on display all night. Chef's knife skills were truly on display with this task, I think he broke the animal down in less than 20 min, ready to serve, he put on quite a show. The main dish was served with espresso infused forbidden rice, colorful veggies, house made apple sauce and gravy. Each perfect. I said to my friend, the sign of a great chef is when there is no need for salt or pepper on anything, and this hit the spot! I have never participated in a beer dinner or a chef hosted dinner before, this was so much fun. Nice to get to know the chef and his take on food and how he prepares. It's obvious he is in the right field, food is his life, and rightful so. I am excited to see more from him in the future.",
