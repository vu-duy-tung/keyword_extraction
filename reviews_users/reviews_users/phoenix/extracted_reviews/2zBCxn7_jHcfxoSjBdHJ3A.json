I  called in the order in about a week before the party.   Picked the order up on the day of party, only to find out that they had made cranberry scones.  I hate cranberries. I pointed this out, and their response was they could make some, but they would not be ready until the next day. Not helpful since the party was that day.   Come on guys. Not only that, but they weren't really scones. Scones are a little on the hard side hence the need for cream and strawberries. These were more like big flat muffin tops. Big fat cranberry muffin tops.",

Arrive 5 minutes before close yes, they want to leave they have lives too. They have been there since 3 or 4 am baking. Come at lunch, to a bakery that serves lunch, yeah you will probably have to wait a few minutes.   This is not PANERA, the kitchen is real, the food is fantastic and the people are people not android bots.   This is a real neighborhood establishment where I have never had bad service, for awhile they knew my breakfast order and saved me my favorite muffin (Raspberry Sour Cream) gaining 5 lbs made me eat here less but it is a treat every time.   EAT HERE you will not regret it!!!",

I went yesterday to pick up a couple coffees and scones and we waited at the counter for 5 minutes before anyone came to the front.  People in the back making food could see us and even made eye contact.  I can't figure out why nobody was up front or was told we were waiting. When someone finally came up we told them we were about to leave and they didn't seem to care.  I decided to try again today... Same thing.  Exact same experience except this time I walked out after 4 minutes, and there was food in the window that I assume was ready for the couple that was in there.

My favorites sandwiches are the turkey jack stack and the garden run. Oh, and the tuna egg and olive which is the special on Fridays. Their ingredients are fresh, delicious, and their flavors are dimensional. 4 stars for the occasional messed up orders/disorganization/whatever. But I still absolutely love them. PS) I overheard them say they were looking to move to the Arcadia area.  Generally I would stay away from the desserts because they are blah, but their sandwiches and salads are amazing. PS) When it comes to thanksgiving special order pies, I highly recommend their chocolate bourbon pecan pie (DEAR GOD was it good!) but NOT their pumpkin pie (which was weird and kind of had my guests looking at it like it came from walmart...which probably actually would have tasted better).",

Even though it was too cold to sit outside on the patio, I decided to eat my lunch in here instead of taking it to-go. There was only about 6 tables with 2 chairs at each table inside but I came in during off hours so there was only 2 other people inside. The menu is very simple with the available salads all inside the see through glass fridge. I got the Monday special which was a soup and a salad for $8.00. I went with the potato leek soup and the only salad available with the combo is the chef garden salad. Both were delicious and fresh. However, I got to choose from many different dressing options. I went with the champagne vinaigrette and I asked for a side of balsamic as well just in case since I am trying something new. One nice thing is that they have tons of little samples up front of their holiday foods and also chocolate bread to try. They also have styrofoam cups with plenty of cold water and lemon wedges. One down side is the lemon wedges are cut so small that I couldn't squeeze it in my water. Next time I am in the area I may try some of the desserts!",

It's terrible. If there is even one person in line ahead of you, please expect to wait nearly 10 minutes for them to hand you the premade salad you've ordered and then finally ring you up. Everyone is always frazzled and clearly upset with one another. It's like the owner doesn't understand basic manners or how to treat people. I've never seen an employee last more than a couple months which is understandable with how I see her openly treat them in front of guests, just imagine how she treats them when we're not around!

All of the side options have been created fresh and all options are amazing.  I'm not huge on customer service as much as other people reviewing BC are. Bottom line for me is that the food tastes fantastic and the product is made with love. I feel far too often we treat establishments as though they owe us something. This isn't McDonald's so I'd take those customer service reviews and shove them you know where.

The service is a little slow but I don't mind waiting for tasty, freshly made sandwiches, and all of the employees are nice and helpful.   The downside is the cost of the kids meals.  It costs $6 for a PBJ sandwich and a bag of chips (or small serving of fruit, etc.).  McAllister's offers a PBJ, chips, and bag of cookies for $1.50.  Even Chop Shop (which is more on par with the quality of Breadcrafters) offers an identical meal for $4.  We'd probably be weekly visitors to Breadcrafters if it didn't cost $12 to feed our kids a couple of PBJ sandwiches.",

You can tell how much time and thought they put into each component to make it absolutely delicious. I had the California club and everything about it was wonderful. My boyfriend had the French Dip and the potato leek soup. Again, wonderful! I'm not sure if this is a locally owned spot or not, but we will be returning very often.",

I tried a breakfast sandwich because it sounded really good when really I went in just for a coffee. I didn't get the coffee because the sandwich alone was just under $10. It was good with its green chills and cheese but I don't think I'd pay $10 for another one.  Also when I walked in it took a good 3-5 mins or so to be greeted as I stood at the counter. With all my experience in customer service it's my biggest pet peeve to not be greeted as soon as I walk in the door. It's a blessing and a curse I suppose. The two ladies working were very friendly though.",

Bags of flour laying all over the floor, kitchen help was not wearing gloves and the counter staff while great looked very frazzled.  I had the Yucatan salad which listed lime chicken (it was just dry 1/8 inch sliced deli chicken, no taste) and corn.  There was not corn in the salad.  It was premade and cost $10.  Too much for the small salad with just 2 slices of check, a few pieces of sliced radish, 2 pieces of mandarin orange and the rest was lettuce.  Not my kind of place.",

I have been told on more then one occassion that I can be little \"Ross\" or \"Joey\"  like from the show  \"Friends\" when it comes to my sandwiches.   Today, we went to Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe for lunch, and it was absolutely delicious. I've had many sandwiches from all over the valley and the folks at Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe are doing up sandwiches right. Lookout,  AJ's Whole Foods, Jimmy Johns, Quiznos, Capriottis, and all the others; Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe is here.  Breadcrafters offers great lunch specials.  You can get a sandwich and your choice of potato salad, pasta salad, fruit salad,  or chips.  Today, my lunch companion and I had the tuna salad on sourdough and the Focaccia Deluxe  (turkey,ham, salami, provolone, lettuce, tomatoes, Parmesan pesto, on Italian herb bread) with a side of potato salad and fruit salad.  I have to admit the Parmesean Pesto spread  was fantastic and the potato salad is the best I ever had.   All the breads at Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe are made fresh daily.  The Walnut Pecan Raisin, Swiss & Black Pepper, look delicious.  I can't wait to try them all on my next visit.  If your in the area give Breadcrafters a try.  Expect great sandwiches, salads, soups, desserts, and the best customer service.",

This area is like a vortex of chainsuck, but we were nearby returning something at Best Buy and popped in to get dinner to go. The super-nice guy at the counter told us to take our time perusing the menu. I go the Turkey Jack Stack (turkey, pepper jack, veggies, avo), and my husband got the Focaccia Deluxe (combo of Italian meats, veggies, parmesan pesto).   The food was FRESHHHHHHHHH. The combo of my sandwich ingredients was perfect, and my little fruit cup side (watermelon/cantaloupe/pineapple) was the perfect addition. The rosemary focaccia on my husband's sandwich was TO DIE, and he loved that his side of potato salad had bacon. (So, vegetarians beware!) Both came with a pickle spear, packed in their own individual ziplock baggie!  We got a lemon-raspberry bar for dessert, because DUH. It was amazing. A lot of their pastries were sold out (we came about an hour before their 7:00 p.m. close time), so they're obviously popular.  Breadcrafters is quick, fast and delicious! I'm pretty sure we'll always take it to-go, as the inside space was a little cramped and we're nearing 100 degree temps, rendering the (cute) little patio useless. But I'm so happy we stopped here!",

We both had their salads which were meh.  It's all about the dressing and theirs was so bland and very acidic.  There was hardly any chicken.   For the price, I would much rather go to other restaurants for bigger portions and serve on real plates and not plastic to go containers like you get at the airport.  If you're in a mood for a salad or sandwich, you're better off with Wildflower (1st choice) or Panera's.",

Their food is very conducive to takeout too, they have ready-made salads and other foods you can take to go.  Once inside, you order and pay at the counter, and wait on the side (if it's to go) or you can sit at a table and they'll bring you the food when it's ready.  You'll be tempted by the delicious, homey baked goods in the glass case, as well as rustic homemade breads you can take home.  Yes, they taste as good as they look.  Items are a little pricey, but you're paying for quality.  And yes, the service is a little abrupt and business-like, but it's not Soup Nazi level.

When we walked in, we were greeted and thanked for supporting a local eatery. It's a smaller sized location, but there seemed to be plenty of seating inside and out.   We chose to sit outside where there were a few other patrons. As soon as we finished our meals, someone came out to take our trays for us.  Service was great. Food was great. Pricing was great for the quality of ingredients being used.  I really hope we get to visit again before returning to Los Angeles.",

The grilled cheese was way to buttery and too much cheese. It was extremely expensive, $9 for bread and cheese.    We ordered the iced white chocolate mocha, it tasted like coffee and milk, not good; and a mocha frappe, it tasted like powdered iced. We were sick to our stomachs after drinking it.  We have not tried the sandwiches, so this is a small scale review. I wouldn't go back. Too pricey for what you get.",

I got there on a Saturday, around 12:15, and needed something in my stomach because I had an appt down the street at 1pm. I ordered a granola yogurt parfait, and asked the guy behind the counter what flavor yogurt they used, and he did not know. I paid for it, then waited approx 25-30 minutes for it. There were tons of people waiting around for their orders. I did not have time to eat it, so I asked for a to-go container. Another ten minutes later, I still didn't have it, and asked for my money back. The lady was very frazzled and nice, and gave me a cup of fruit and bag of chips because she knew I was hungry and now did not have time to eat. I will never go there again, very poorly run",

Or 'Let's get rid of those green straws.' I love supporting local. The quality of the food is impeccable! I love the breakfasts--try the Benedict's best. You can have it as a sandwich or plated with bread on the side. For lunch I love the chicken salad plate or the park avenue sandwich. My fav salad is the BBQ chicken. Dressings are homemade and you can tell! And let's talk about their soup! The chicken tortilla is my fave on Wednesdays and Thursday's! Coffee is great! Ice tea is awesome! Angela calls the beverage side of the business 'BevCrafters.' Cute place, friendly staff---check it out!",

My favorite is the rice and abondigo and the Pozole. I have had a few different breakfast sammies and the stuffed French toast. They usually have pre made salads to go for someone who is looking for quick and healthy meal. During the holidays they always have a special catering menu that you can order from! The prime rib is amazing! They are also known for their pies too! I have had the pumpkin pie, chocolate pretzel and cherry pie! All of them were delicious! They serve everything from breakfast, lunch and dinner! Every time I go in there they are busy! I wish they had more locations because the food is delicious and fresh! Great service too! The prices are a bit higher than what you would expect for a small place like this, but the food is amazing and worth it.  I just had their southwest chicken sandwich with the stuffed avocado chicken salad! I also ordered their Valentine's Day cherry pie!!! Omg!!! Delicious all around!!!",

I ordered a build your own sandwich, which gives s choice or meat and a choice of cheese.  I am vegan and asked to hold the cheese and hold the meat--requested avocado in place of meat and cheese.  \"There's an upcharge for avocado\", the guy tells me.  Event though I'm paying the price for meat and cheese, but not getting any meat or cheese?? \"Yes\", he says. \"I have to do what the owner tells me. There are no exceptions\".",

Being a native New Yorker, I also had to try the egg salad on baguette sandwich and was not disappointed. The owner, Angela is a hoot. She is friendly, upbeat, hands-on, dedicated, and obviously loves, and is proud of, her operation. Don't we all wish all restaurant owners in town were like that!",

Seats are outside, with only 6 seats inside and very very crammed in...The homemade cookies are not super sweet and very good.  Had a legend trail and double chocolate chunk.  They have breakfast as well as lunch.  Their bread is homemade with out all the preservatives and contain the simple ingredients - flour, eggs, yeast, sugar, water no soy and no junk.  We had a party of 5 the patio outside should be a little bigger as it is hard to move around when it gets crowded like today.  The #7 which is a veggie sandwich was very good, and big a whole sandwich can feed two people comes with a pickle.  The egg and bacon sandwich was also very good and comes with strawberries.  Nice place to stop for a quick bite, the chairs are uncomfortable and the space is very crammed, once it gets hot outside not sure where people will go as they have limited tables inside....Pretty good food and great bread but needs more seating options to enjoy the food.",

It's different than your run of the mill sandwich shop and I'm in love with the Turkey Jack Stack. They also have a great chicken and avocado salad when I'm trying to be a little healthier. The space is a little small on the inside, but they have a large outdoor dining space for those cooler fall days and if you're willing in the summer, the misters are always on. I still have yet to actually try the bread, which they make fresh daily, but it always looks and smells delicious.",

Last Sunday I ended up there when looking for a breakfast for my daughter, Sammy. See all my talk about junk food has come to fruition and she won't grab a quick bite at Mc D's or Burger King...which is exactly what I want, for her to be discerning ... but  you get the idea. Now I have to find better more expensive choices/healthier foods , oh well she is worth it.  This little bakery has a tidy selection of  muffins and scones fresh and the place smelled nice.  Daughter had a Morning Muffin , which I would call a Morning Glory Muffin , it had a spicier taste but not nutmeg or cinnamon , Sammy wasn't thrilled . I thought it smelled good. I had a berry scone which tasted really good.  I would go back for one if I was in the neighborhood.   One down side was the counter service, the gal was doing her best , but one person taking orders getting drinks, bakery goods, and refilling teas and coffee seemed a bit much . While there we saw a constant line of  people and the poor girl couldn't get caught up , she would have to stop and refill tea machines  and that meant people waiting.  I felt bad for her.  One side note they had a nice selection of pre-made  food  like fresh cut up fruit , veggies and chicken breast that looked good for fast eating on the run.",

I can not say I was real impressed but it could have been what I ordered. The bread looks great and the few sandwiches I saw looked good. The thing that bothered me most about this place is that the staff did not seem very friendly. Seems like a nice bakery and a good location but I the staff could make this place a lot better and more inviting!",

    "text": "I have been here about a half dozen times.   The first time, I would have given it four or five stars.   I had a veggie sandwich where I chose what went on it. It was very yummy. The only problem was that biting and chewing the sandwich was a bit tough as the crust on the (yummy) sourdough bread was tough, but it was worth it, cause it was good.   However, two or three times I have ordered roasted red pepper (which costs extra) and received green pepper instead. I've usually been too hungry to bother asking for red pepper and just eaten the sandwich as is.   I've gotten some sourdough bread to go before, makes for yummy sandwiches at home.   The other negative is that one of the women who works there before has been a bit standoffish and not very helpful. In one instance, my grandma ordered coffee only to be told they were out of it, in a not so nice tone.   Overall, their bread makes for yummy sandwiches, but starting to wonder if it is worth it to go out of my way for a sandwich and mediocre service.",

I bring home a tub of the spread (sold sep) and a bag of the toasted bread for dipping when I have company. The baked goods are also excellent. All fresh and baked on premises.

In an environment surrounded by large chain restaurants with your standard unhealthy boring food Breadcrafters was a real discovery. It has a prime location and everything is made fresh in house. Not only do they have great lunches but they have amazing breakfasts and you can buy their bake goods for your own personal use as well. It was a little on the pricey side, $25 for two people for lunch, but then again healthy and home made always is. They are also pet friendly with treats and water so bring your dog and relax out on the covered patio with misters. I highly recommend Breadcrafters Bakery & Cafe for anyone looking to break away from the representativeness that is chain restaurant dining.",

This is a combo bakery/sandwich shop, though I was disappointed with the sandwich selection. I got the country club sandwich, but didn't want the swiss cheese that comes standard. I had to settle for colby over the cheddar I wanted; I was a little surprised that a sandwich shop would fail to have cheddar cheese. I also ordered the potato salad, which is definitely a different style than I'm used to. Instead of creamy, it was basically little block of potato--with skins--with a wee bit of dressing. It wasn't terrible, but I wish they would have described it in more detail than just saying it was \"potato salad.\" The sandwich itself wasn't bad, but wasn't memorable either. Either way, it didn't seem worth the $10 I spent there on a basic sandwich and drink.",

Unfortunately Sun morning I ordered two breakfast burritos to-go.  I then waited patiently for 30 mins with other customers getting their dine-in plates who came in well after I placed my order.   I eventually inquired if there was a problem with my order.   The guy gave me attitude with rolling eyes and all....\"We're trying (blah blah)\".    When I looked back into the kitchen there were children apparently from the staff, hanging out at the food prep table and there was no sense of urgency back there that I could tell.   I'd still NOT be writing this review if when I got home, the two burritos unwrapped and stuck to the foil making a mess I wouldn't feed anyone.

Not too heavy on the greens, refreshing combos of protein and produce.  My favorite salad hands down is the chicken salad stuffed avocado with sliced strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and kiwi. I get champagne vinaigrette on the side, house made.   I've had a hot soup, sorry to say I can't remember which one but I liked it, the choices appear to rotate.  Infusion iced tea offered, locally owned in Tempe.  I'm not a huge bread/rolls person but their sourdough and raisin walnut is worth the carb splurge imo.   Lots of tempting baked goods as well. I can't vouch for taste but I am going to indulge one of these days! Classics like cookies or fruit tart, and creative offerings like House made kit Kat bars and HUGE fun covered strawberries( go find out for yourself)  Icing on the cake is great friendly warm service with a smile each time. I've been in 4 or 5 times in the past 2 weeks. Speed of service is also fantastic considering the quality.   I love stopping in for lunch whenever I'm in the area. Catering available as well.",

We had family in from North Carolina and enjoyed a loverly dinner.  Then disaster struck.  I bit into my apple cranberry piece of pie and THERE WAS CHOCOLATE IN IT!!!  A whole layer of chocolate under the apple and cranberry.  I couldn't believe it and I was so embarrassed.  It tasted horrible.  The pumpkin pie was crappy too!!!      To make matters worse I tried numerous times to contact the owner for a refund by phone and through their website and heard nothing then finally sent her a message through facebook!!   I heard back from her and she admitted to me they rarely check their email off the website - thats good business sense!. She asked me for my address to send the check to and gave it to her.  A couple weeks went by, received nothing so  I emailed my address again.    To this day (June 14th) I still have not received a refund!!!  We used to lunch there once in a while but now WE WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!!  And this year I will make my own pies!!!  Lesson Learned!! It shows me that they do not care about their customers!!",

    "text": "Disappointed after reading pretty decent reviews on this place. Went today around 2:15....it was pretty dead, I was the only customer in there. Ordered two sandwiches, two bags of chips and a cup of soup to go. Not cheap, about $27. The guy that helped me was not friendly at all. While he was ringing me up, another guy tells him that someone in the back \"isn't usually like that\" and that she was in a bad mood because someone else didn't show up for work. My cashier responds to him with \"I don't care, it's not my job to do that\"....obviously there had been an issue between coworkers before I walked in, but to have the conversation while I'm trying to order makes things awkward. My food was ready about 10 mins later and I was just glad to get out of there. We got a club and a southwest chicken sandwich. The club literally had one slice of turkey, one slice of ham and some bacon. Not worth $9. The southwest chicken sandwich had greasy soggy bread and dry chicken...and a bonus eyelash. The potato leek soup was actually pretty good, but the croutons that came with it were burnt and the slice of bread we were given with it was dry and had a dead gnat on it. I was excited to try this place, but definitely won't be back.",

The kid (one of the two young guys that was working at the time) that took our order kept getting SO confused and kept asking us repeatedly what we were getting or trying to talk to us about a different sandwich when we had already told him what we wanted. So ordering was like pulling teeth. The same kid went to the back to make our sandwiches and we went to sit outside because the guy said he would bring them to us, but then we noticed the person who ordered after us got their sandwich and left already so we went inside to check on it.... and let's just say the sandwiches looked less than appetizing and I have no idea why it took the so long to make the HOT sandwich  because the cheese wasn't even melted! He also used the wrong bread for each of our sandwiches, forgot the spread that was supposed to be on it, and forgot the veggies. It really just looked like WAY too much meat on bread. Anyway, we brought the sandwiches back in to the other guy that was working and he said he'd remake them. They came back out looking beautiful, but due to the time that was wasted ordering, waiting, and waiting again we had no time to do the things we needed to do in Phoenix before we had to drive back to Flagstaff. That being said, I would still try this place again (which is why I gave it 3 stars) because the person who told us about it said it was owned by two ladies who make everything from scratch and I think they have a great little place, but that guy should not be making them! Hopefully next time the owners will be there. I feel horrible saying that because he was super friendly and nice, but he couldn't stay focused and didn't prepare the food the way it was supposed to be or in a presentable way. Oh, one last thing: there was way too much meat on the sandwiches. Maybe it's just me, but I would've been happy with thinner slices of chicken (we got the Santa Fe chicken and the chicken cordon bleu). Also, the Gorgonzola spread was SO GOOD!!",

Luckily I found it without too much trouble, on the corner of the strip center next to Julio G's.    It's a cute, small place, with cases displaying their pastries and boxes of to go salads.  Lots of great patio seating outside.  They seemed slightly understaffed for the steady trickle of guests - just one girl taking the orders AND running back making all the food - I saw a couple other people working, but had no idea what they could be doing, since she was doing it all. (she was great btw and I didn't mind waiting for her)  I wanted half a sandwich with a cup of soup, which they do offer except it has to be a cold sandwich.  I also had my heart set on a hot sandwich that I saw on their website, but when I scanned the menu it wasn't even up there.  Oh well.  I got the half focaccia sandwich (turkey ham and salami with parmesan pesto) with the cup of chicken tortilla.  The soup was okay - it had potato, which I thought was odd, and they didn't give me any tortilla strips or any kind of topping for it.  The bread on the sandwich was awesome.  The meats were alright.  I liked the parmesan pesto (it definitely wasn't a pesto though - it was white instead of basil-green), but it was layed on super thick so I couldn't really enjoy the sandwich.  I got a scone to go (ended up not being very scone-like) and also a sliced loaf of the raisin walnut pecan bread.  I like the bread a lot.  Even though I didn't love my meal, I think I just got the wrong things.  I will definitely come back and maybe try a hot sandwich and another kind of soup.  They also do breakfast, so I will have to try that too.",

He was very nice but my God was he scatterbrained, unorganized and just plain not good at his job. He seemed too overwhelmed for the small lunch rush that was there. We ordered the cranberry turkey sandwich and the Yucatan salad. He brought out the sandwich and never gave us the salad. So we waited....and my friend finally just gave me the other half of his sandwich and after 20 minutes, just asked for our money back. The sandwich was so good and the pastries looked amazing but we just wanted to go after being there for so long without so much as a heads up about an ETA of our salad. Restaurants run into problems, but it's the way you handle it that brings people back. We overheard the guy behind us as we were leaving say to the young man...   \"hey, can I please just have my damn sandwich\" . So, obviously, we weren't the only ones with issues. Small businesses like that are usually a popular spot, they need to hire someone up front that knows what's going on especially in that restaurant and test them on the menu. He was absolutely clueless.",

I was just looking for a place close to my apartment where I could get a healthy lunch while getting online to get some work done.  Being a Saturday around lunchtime, I was a little worried about finding a place that wasn't totally packed.  After trying quite a few places nearby that didn't have wi-fi (why not Floyd's Kitchen? How expensive is a router really?) I walked down the strip mall and found Breadcrafters.  I have co-workers that love this place, and they did have a place I would work (outside none the less, and we have to enjoy the weather here while we can!) so I got a salad and sat down to work.    While the salad and a drink was $10, it was more than big enough to satisfy and they let me know I could get free refills.  No TV's, which could be a plus to some people, but I was hoping to watch the Bulls playoff game. I will come here again, when I'm in the right mood.  Next time the Bulls are playing however, look for me at Buffalo Wild Wings.",

While the food was ok and i'm all for supporting a small locally owned business we walked away a little disappointed.   They focus on all types of breads including a variety of loaves, rolls, and some baked goods.  The also offer the usual lunch options of sandwiches, soups, and salads (premade).  Tried 1/2 chicken salad sandwich on some sort of raisin bread and a chicken noodle salad and 1 drink.  Both were not bad but also not memorable or unique in any way.  Service was  so-so as you got the impression that they were just focused on finishing up lunch service so they could close shop.  In their haste to get orders out they rang up ours wrong and forgot the roll and dressing.   Overall seemed kinda pricey at $18 considering what we ordered and the competition. And unless the weather is nice enough to sit outside there is only seating for 8 or so. Nothing really unique about this place and can neither endorse nor oppose going to this place.  Give me a few days and i will probably forget about this place.",

Obviously their bread is superb, but they also have beautiful salads, delectable homemade soups, gorgeous pastries and desserts, fantastic sandwiches, the best potato salad ever and HUGE amazing breakfast burritos!! They usually have at least two diff types of freshly brewed iced tea, and also have an espresso machine which I love bc I adore fresh espresso. Nice diverse selection of other beverages too. I'm fortunate enough to live only 2.5 miles from here but I would drive dozens if I had to!",

The bread was toasted to PERFECTION, the turkey was very flavorful and still moist! My sandwich was juicy but not too wet, so my sandwich stayed together with no problems. I had the barbecue chips with the sandwich, also yummy. And their water is good too-- not mineral-tasting AT ALL. Big kudos for that!!   The only reason they didn't get 5 stars was because the people that work there became flustered VERY quickly (there were a couple of patrons sitting down and eating, and two ladies had walked in at the same time as me. This was my first time there, and I definitely became stressed out when I heard the gentleman talk the first time-- don't get me wrong, I could tell he was trying to be polite, but it wasn't the most welcome experience, so much so that I almost walked out. But their salads and pastries on display looked AMAZING, and I could tell everything was REAL, you know? So I decided to take a chance and order, even feeling intimidated.  And I am SO GLAD I did. The food MORE than made up for my initial customer experience, and I will definitely be coming back here. I can't wait to try something else here!",

    "text": "I met a friend for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. I didn't even know anything about this place it's been here for awhile but never really had a desire to even try but what the heck.   I walk in and there are a few tables inside and a bunch of tables outside with a water mister which is required for this AZ heat. Anyways, there menu is above the counter. Sandwiches, sandwiches, and more sandwiches which is fine since it's called Breadcrafters. They lady at the counter was very nice and acknowledged me right away for my order.   I had the Southwest Chicken sandwich which is one of there hot sandwiches. It has slices of grilled chicken with grilled jalapenos, green chili, avocado on a grilled sour dough bread. Really good. Chicken was moist and the sandwich wasn't that spicy but had the right kick to it. It came with a side and I got a scoop of their potato salad. Really liked that too. I love potato salad and this didn't disappoint. Really good meal. Really good sandwich.   So what you do is order at the counter, get your own drink, and find your own table. They bring your food to your table. They don't give you anything for your order but the people behind the counter remembers you and bring the food to your table. Very nice touch compared to all these others places. Nice personal touch. Oh yea, they even come by and take your plates away. Very nice.   This is a very welcoming sandwich spot. Interesting spot. Very casual place. Love the personal touch. Enjoyed the food. Really good. I did notice that there were people always coming in and out of this place so it's pretty popular. So if you want different types of sandwiches then I would say give it a try. I did and really enjoyed it.",

The pricing is a tad high but that's expected with homemade salads, sandwiches and bakery.

I also ordered one of their hot sandwiches, the Southwest Chicken.  It came with a side of choice, and I went with their Cole Slaw.  It was a great housemade slaw.  A pickle spear and slice of bread/pad o butter was also included.  All in all, I was STUFFED! Great local spot that I plan to try again and explore more combos.

It's in an unassuming little shopping center on Tatum across the street from PV Mall.  I noticed the sign but never thought twice about going in until my friend Deborah recently told me that they have wonderful sandwiches and salads that are perfect for picking up when you're on the run.  So, instead of trusting Deborah 100% (I don't know her THAT well yet), I sent my mom in to try Breadcrafters when she asked me where she should go for lunch during her last visit.  It passed the 'mom test' with flying colors... my mom loved it - she said it was perfect!  Today was my turn... and needless to say, I was extremely impressed!  The staff was really sincere, friendly and helpful.  When I walked in, I smelled fresh bread and I saw several cases full of not only bread, but sandwiches, salads, and baked goods too!  Everything looked awesome!  I looked at the menu and noticed that prices were reasonable and they offered daily specials including soup/sandwich combo and 'the daily double' where you pick two different items to make your own combo.  It took me a few minutes. but I decided to design my own sandwich off the menu... I went with turkey, lettuce, tomato. avocado., sprouts, and spicy mustard on multi-grain alsatian bread.  It came with my choice of sides (I went with coleslaw) and a pickle.  If you've read my reviews, you know I don't usually go into detail about the food more than saying what I ordered, liked, didn't like. etc... however, I have to make an exception on this one.  The sandwich may sound like any other sandwich you could pick up anywhere, but this sandwich was special!  Every bite I took, I tasted all of the ingredients.  It was balanced perfectly!  Just the right amount of mustard and avocado spread evenly on the bread, fresh and juicy turkey. crisp lettuce, and ripe tomato.  Yum!  I was there after 2 for a late lunch expecting this random place to be empty... but I was wrong.  The place was hopping!  I noticed that people were eating outside (it was a beautiful day) and that Breadcrafters is DOG FRIENDLY!  I also noticed that many people came in just to buy freshly-baked bread.  Not a bad idea - I'll have to remember that for next time we're entertaining!  I overheard Angela. the (new) owner, tell a customer that the bread sold like crazy today, so I imagine the best selection is first thing in the morning... It may have been my first visit to Breadcrafters but it will not be my last.  See you there!",

I always get a sandwich and add the pesto mayo sauce to it. And no one can resist their Molten choco cookies.   This is a great little bakery who makes traditional artisan breads. Their breads are awesome. If you are one of those whinny bitches that say, 'oh this bread is too hard' stay away. First of all, you wouldn't know what good bread is if i hit you with a day old baguette. Their bread is crispy slightly burnt on the outside and soft on the inside. Perfect artistry here.",

They are out of breakfast menus and the kid behind the counter said he doesn't know the menu and can't help until the owner gets back from printing the menu. They are also out of coffee but he assured us he's making some. He over charges us for our meal and then helps the other customers before refunding us.  Now the coffee is ready and  it comes out a light shade of pale. Send that back. Waiting entirely too long now for our food and was told everything is made to order. Well it's bacon and eggs so I would hope so.  Asked for a refund. Owner passive aggressively tells us to have a blessed and wonderful day and we left.  Great concept. Bread is amazing but they really need to get their act together   Won't be back on a Sunday again that's for sure.",

    "text": "I went here for lunch a few days ago.  I guess we got here before the lunch rush because it was dead when we got there but the small place started to fill up pretty fast.  There are under 10 small tables in the place so if you are dining in get here as early as you can.  I know they can't help it but the place is pretty small, hot and cramped when it gets crowded.  I also don't like it that you have to ask for a soda refill and can't just get it yourself.  I do understand though that space is an issue here and it isn't a full service restaurant so it is what it is.  All the workers are very very friendly and helpful however.  For my sandwich I chose the Turkey Jack Stack.  I loved the sourdough bread but the actual sandwich was just standard.  It was of a decent size and had plenty of fresh ingredients, but the flavor was just eh.  Not really worth $7.50.  The cole slaw is pretty good as it was not overly creamy.  It was perfect for a hot summer day and was quite refreshing...or as refreshing as cole slaw can be.    The cookies are also very good and fresh.  There is an awesome chocolate one where they put in crasins which is a welcome touch and adds a sweet-tartness to the cookie.  I highly recommend it.",

When we arrived we looked and and were surprised to see how small it is in here.  The seating is tight and awkward.  It was too chilly and rainy to eat out doors so we made it work.    We decided on the half sandwich and soup of the day special.  The sandwich of the day was a roast beef with a cream cheese spread that was supposed to have horseradish and we had 3 soup choices, Tortilla soup, tomato basil bisque and chicken veggie pesto pasta.  Mom decided on the tortilla soup and while I told the lady tomato bisque I was thinkin the chicken pasta...and typical as it is when I picked up my meal on the tray instead of the tomato bisque, they served me the chicken pasta.       The soup was plentiful.  Mom made a meal of the soup (her's was heartier than mine) and saved her sandwich.  My soup was more brothy with a dollup of pesto and had frozen style mixed veggies and an assortment of canned beans and a few pieces of pasta (didn't see any chicken).  The sandwich was just ok, when mom had hers later she too was unimpressed.    Well this place was no Paradise Bakery but I like the opportunity to support small local business.",

    "text": "I have been going to Breadcrafters for the past five years, and it is HANDS DOWN one of my all-time favorite sandwich spots in Phoenix! Here are some of my favorite food choices:  Sandwich: I typically build my own sandwich which I like to call Old Faithful. It is a perfect combination of turkey, provolone, lettuce, tomato, with their parmesan pesto spread on a baguette. The parmesan pesto spread is OUT OF THIS WORLD - you haven't lived if you haven't tried it! Their chicken salad is also fantastic. They serve it with lettuce and tomato on their walnut raisin bread, and it is great! They have all kinds of great sandwich creations, all of which I've tried. I am being completely honest when I say I haven't had a bad sandwich at Breadcrafters.  Salads: My favorite is the Napa Valley chicken salad. It has sliced marinated chicken with bleu cheese crumbles and grapes and is served with a champagne vinegrette. It's delish!  Pastries: All the pastries are great, but I love their scones and muffins. They are huuuuge portions, so you could make a breakfast out of a scone and cup of coffee. Their desserts are out of this world as well. I highly recommend the apple fritter, brownie (insanely chocolatey), lemon raspberry bars, and their molten chocolate chip cookie (it's a dark chocolate cookie with raspberry).  Bread and Dips: My favorite breads are the sourdough, french country (a lighter sourdough), viennese (an egg bread), garlic parmesan and regular baguettes. The dips that they sell are beau monde (a delicious herb/dill dip that's great with veggies), parmesan pesto (my fave!), roasted onion gorgonzola (another fave), and an olive tapenade.   As far as the service goes, everyone is always SUPER friendly. It's one of those \"cheers-esque\" places where everybody knows your name :) I will be a life-long customer, because this place really knows how to do good, fresh food!",

They forgot to put some of the items we asked for on both sandwiches....they forgot the BF's cheese and they forgot a couple of my veggies. Additionally, I asked for the pesto on the side and it came out on the sandwich, so I was not thrilled with that. Despite these errors, the food still tasted good. We both had turkey sandwiches, I had mine on focaccia with a bunch of veggies and the BF had his on sourdough with bacon. Both sandwiches had fresh ingredients and soft bread...very good. I also had the albondigas soup which was a bit on the greasy side, but had a lot of flavor.

I was a bit surprised to have to pay over $10 for a breakfast burrito, but it was one of the better ones I've had, with interesting touches like fresh spinach, homemade chorizo, sauteed mushrooms and quality bacon. Plus it was huge. Could easily split it with someone, which would make the price totally justifiable.  WiFi was abysmal - I usually rely on a quick wifi jolt when I'm looking for stops like this during my workday so to me that's significant, but for most people that's a non-issue.

Others think that it's a secret ingredient that maker uses like a dash of celery salt or paprika. My mom used to make me a sandwich of sliced turkey, Muenster cheese, Miracle Whip, bread and butter pickles on Wonder bread. I've made this sandwich so many times but have never been able to make it taste as good as hers.   I recently tested this out at Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe in Paradise Valley where they specialize in fresh bakes breads, house made salads and of course sandwiches made by someone else. Breadcrafters isn't your ordinary sandwich shop, as the name indicates they also bake bread and pastries, but oh the bread! For me this is one of the best bread bakeries in a town that only has a handful of really good bread makers.   To celebrate such amazing bread, why not make amazing sandwiches?   Nancy's Favorite ($7.75) arrived piled high with roast beef, Gorgonzola and roasted onion spread, roasted red peppers, lettuce and tomato on a crusty baguette. Aside form the chewy flavorful baguette and the tender roast beef, the bold and creamy notes of the cheese spread makes this sandwich a stack-of-love. By contrast the Turkey Jack Stack ($7.75) had a spicy bite thanks to pepper jack cheese and red onion. The sourdough bread it was served on was so spongy and flavorful I ordered a loaf ($4.50) to go.   Unfortunately the Park Avenue Chicken Salad ($7.75) was under-seasoned; its only saving grace was the incredible raisin walnut pecan bread it was served on. On my next visit, Ill just pick up a loaf ($4.50) of the bread and skip the salad.   When you order a sandwich you have your choice of potato salad, pasta salad, fruit, coleslaw or potato chips. I might avoid the disappointing potato salad. The potatoes were oven roasted which is great but the spuds were over cooked and dehydrated making for a chewy strange tasting mess.   The love doesn't stop at their bread; they make cupcakes that are moist and inviting. On my last visit I picked up a Red Velvet Cupcake ($2.75) and a Strawberry Shortcake Cupcake ($2.75).  On my way back home I couldn't stop thinking about the cute little white box housing my treats. Once home, dessert came first! The shortcake cupcake wasn't shortcake at all but made from angel food cake, then topped with real whipped cream and a glazed strawberry. This was one of those desserts you savor and enjoy though I ended up eating the whole thing in about four bites, yes it was that good. Wiping the crumbs from my face I proceeded to convince myself that I would only have a single bite of the red velvet, wrong. I couldn't resist licking the cream cheese frosting off before devouring the moist and ultra chewy cake.   While there is still no concrete reason why a sandwich made by someone else's hand is better, I do know this, I enjoyed trying to prove this one out.",

The portions were not overly large but normal sized. All 3 of us were happy with our meals. Self serve ice tea (one lemonade) were fine.

Breadcrafters is a \"one-of\" (not a chain) breakfast and lunch place just east of Paradise Valley mall, and it is a good one.  The real key to good sandwiches is good bread, so a place like this that bakes their own can have a big advantage -- if their bread is good.  In this case, it is.  Furthermore, the ingredients within the buns are fresh, tasty, and plentiful.  Special kudos to the tuna melt (not fried - just melted cheese), and a delight containing chicken and cheese.  An inventive mojito bar for dessert worked too.  Because it is fairly small, it can get crowded at peak times and I imagine that service could slow down a bit.  However, we waited only seven minutes when it was half full.  With its pleasant outdoor seating, as well as indoor, Breadcrafters is the best of class for sandwich places in Scottsdale-PV.",

I called in my order based on the items from their website. After viewing their website a few times, I thought they were part of a chain similar to Paradise Bakery. When I arrived to pick up my order, I was in complete shock as they are not a chain. According to the woman I spoke to, they have been around over 10 years. (And I just now noticed?!) My order consisted of a French dip for my husband and a roast beef melt for me. Their dessert case looked delicious, so I added a chocolate brownie for good measure. The woman behind the counter, who took my phone order, was both helpful and nice. I thought perhaps she was the owner or had been working for the company a long time as she seemed to know a lot.  Once back in the office, I dug into my sandwich. I really liked mine. The roast beef was delicious and I really liked the bread but the overall flavors of caramelized onions, mushrooms and mustard really blended well together. My husband liked my sandwich more than his French dip. I admit the French dip was a little disappointing. It was just bread, meat, and a small container for dipping sauce. It was a lot of bread and meat and no cheese. We've definitely had better French dips. However, the brownie... oh, it was amazing. It was super soft and fudgy with a dark chocolate frosting on top. Super decadent and would love to eat another or ten.   If in the area, I would definitely go back and try more of their sandwiches and desserts.",

A really good cup:)  The muffin was HUGE and so light and fluffy. Will definitely be back again to try some other things. The lunch menu looked really good:)",

We recently moved into the area and have been trying some local places by our house and while out shopping last weekend we decided to stop into Breadcrafters for lunch. I am soooo glad we did. I had the Southwest Chicken and it was amazing!!!! I'm super picky about chicken and it was juicy, and the flavors of the entire sandwich was just spot on. My boyfriend had the Twisted Turkey and he really, really liked his as well. This place is super cute and had such a cozy feel to it. I am not a huge sandwich person but found myself thinking about this sandwich again! Service was great and I think on our next visit I will have to try a yummy dessert or something.",

    "text": "This was a very good sandwich from all the quality ingredients to the construction of the sandwich itself. I had seen this place driving through PV and it looks like a big place, but the patio is bigger than the inside actually, which is not a great thing in the summer. You just order at the counter and there isn't a bunch a room to wait for the to-go order, so you will be shuffling around avoiding people waiting for your order. My sandwich was served on Raisin Pecan cranberry bread I believe and it was a unique combo of cream cheese and cranberry sauce and high quality turkey and lettuce and tomato. You must try the potato salad as the side dish also. It was nearly a perfect sandwich and it was about 10 bucks. A winner and they also had some unique cookies to try next time (cornflake).",

    "text": "Stopped into Breadcrafters for a quick lunch on a Saturday. They were moderately busy but not packed. Looking at the prices I assumed the sandwiches would be quite large and I was right. My boyfriend and I split one and for a light lunch the size was just right.   We split the club with a side of pasta salad. The bread was fresh and soft and the ingredients were plentiful and fresh tasting as well. While the sandwich was big, the side was not - even for a single serving. I felt like they kinda skimped a little on the pasta. But what was there had a good flavor - a pesto sauce of some kind I think - with olives, red peppers and mushrooms.   We sat outside, the patio was nice and relaxing.  Overall I'd say it was good but I wasn't blown away. I'd like to go back and try a different sandwich and side to see how it compares.",

I may have forgotten what extremely fresh bread tastes like, thank you for the reminder!  The ambiance is charming, the desserts begged for more attention, but I settled on the Turkey and Pepper-jack sandwich.  It was truly amazing!  My friends and family are very fortunate because my next event will be catered by them!  Fresh food, excellent presentation, knowledgeable, kind, and caring staff!",
