    "text": "So, I gave a lone star as My friends and I had a miserable time there 2 weeks ago when we went to check out the new brewery in our hood. I am a beer enthusiast and always try to drink from the local brewers instead of the giants. Atmosphere is really nice, looks clean and real simple set up, a True German style brewery. The service SUCKS! the lady who served us, was least interested in her job nor knew anything about it. It makes me wonder how she passed the interview, or was there one at all?! She offered no description of the beers nor the specials nor the brewery philosophy etc. We had to ask her to tell us about the 6 types of their brew and she told us they are on the board on the wall and we can look it up. We did!  Food was nothing special. The beers were ok I guess (we were so aggravated by the service that didn't care about the beer). We shortly left and had never gone back.  I will give them another try as this may have been a fluke with the crappy server who simply didn't care for the owner nor her job! More review to follow later.",

I'm repeatedly disappointed by 4 Peaks, Ohso, the Yard, and many others that are trying so hard. This reminds me of my favorite small breweries and beer houses in Germany and my favorite neighborhood place down the street from where I used to live in North Portland. The food is good, I love the kale salad (huge), and the poutine is decadent and amazing. The beers are great, I love the red and there's a great American pale on occasionally too. I highly recommend North Mountain.",

    "text": "I like almost everything about NMBC.  I have been in maybe a couple dozen times, and have tasted just about every brew so far.  Many varieties are a little hoppy for my taste, but I really have enjoyed the hefes, the N'erotic Belgian, and others.  The food is also very good, with the grilled cheese, brussel-sprout salad, burgers and crab dip being my favorites.  As for the service, each time I have been there it has been excellent, with a friendly staff whether sitting at bar or table.  A fun and casual atmosphere, and a great addition to the Sunnyslope area, is NMBC.  I said I like almost everything:  I really liked sitting at the bar a lot more before the TVs were installed.  Now there is no place to sit without that distraction except the patio, and it's not quite cool enough during the day yet.  Do you really need that many TVs in one room?   Also, it's great to have live music, but the lack of a sound system is a major drag.  Finally, I appreciate the notifications about the radio broadcasts - so I can plan my visits to avoid them.   I really like the brews, the food and the service, and I've met a number of nice folks at the bar.  The \"entertainment\" I can do without.  I will continue to enjoy the beers and the food - just have to come in earlier in the day.",

I've had the poutine, the hot wings, the burgers, the ahi tuna appetizer, the pretzel bread, and the malt! The food has never disappointed me. The burgers are hands down the best I've had in Phoenix. I'm originally from Nebraska where we take our beef very seriously, and their burgers have wowed me. They use the beer wort to make an ice cream malt that is amazing. No alcohol in it, but has a hint of beer flavor that makes it a refreshing treat. Service has always been spot on for me.",

It is fairly close to our house, but we would drive a great distance to continue to regularly go here...it's that good! We go here on a once a week basis. Their beer menu is wonderful, and every single beer is full of flavor and unique. The food is FRESH and beyond delicious. I always have a hard time ordering something new because each meal is so amazing I want to keep ordering the same thing, but every time I try something different I have a NEW FAVORITE! My top choices are the steak sandwich, fish and chips, the North Mountain burger, and the shepherd's pie (which is MELT IN YOUR MOUTH delicious). I love the family business feel, and the owner is always on-site making sure everything is running smoothly and all the customers are happy. I feel so lucky to have found a place my fiance and I can eat at and feel like we're home and feel like family. We love it so much, we're even considering serving their beer at our wedding in Sedona. Do NOT pass this place up. It is a local gem.",

Many spots that make their own beer focus primarily on a great brew, but these guys could stand alone on the food. The chicken sandwich is \"out of this world\" delicious. It is lightly breaded with a thin coat of some wonderful spread called bacon jam. The name sounds funny but that stuff is the perfect compliment to the chicken. It is impressive to discover a restaurant that can produce food and drink in the same manner that Chopin produced music.  The arrangement of the tables could use an overhaul. Group seating and 6 tops are not the way that most patrons want to dine.  The food quality does over shadow the funny seating configuration. Tables can be changed.",

    "text": "On our never-ending quest to find the best microbrew, we visited on a Saturday afternoon, not too busy, though the parking lot was pretty full. There's a patio facing Dunlap, but we sat inside, nice decor, bright, airy, inviting lots of TV's for the sports lover. We got the 8 flight, the best were N'eurotic Belgium Ale, a little sweet but packs a punch with 10.4%; The Barrel Aged Octomalt, my fave, was so complex, the rum barrel aging definitely adding another dimension to the regular Octomalt brew. The James Brown Imperial Soul, a stout that was smooth and no bitterness whatsoever. We liked Groovin with a Pict, a Scottish ale,  but it can't compare to our favorite, the Scootcher from Sleepy Dog Brewery in Tempe. We could fill a growler $12-$14 but not with any that we really wanted (N'eurotic, barrel Octomalt, James Brown), so we decided not to. They also have an extensive food menu. I chose the Poutine, french fries covered in a rich brown gravy, awesome ale braised short ribs, and topped with cheese curds, so decadent that I had to share. Good thing, because the hubby chose fish and chips, 3 fresh tasting, beer battered pieces with shoestring fries that was a little lacking in portion size for $12. Add another portion or make the ones you serve bigger, please! Will we come again? Yes, and we will be bringing our friends, too.",

The second visit was after work on a Friday and the service, food (north mountain burger), and beer (Belgian) were great. 5 stars for that night. Tonight, however is a completely different story. My brother in law chose North Mtn for his birthday dinner destination, as he normally has a good experience here. We waited NINETY MINUTES (plus!) for our food. My 'Caesar' salad was literally a plate of lettuce. No croutons (the menu description had croutons listed as an ingredient),  and no Parmesan Romano blend cheese, just a plate of limp romaine with a breast of grilled chicken. We dined with a party of 12, and everyone's entree came out 10 mins apart. When bringing this to the manager's attention, she replied \"I'll be right back\" and never came back to check that these problems had been corrected. We asked the waiter for some bread (at this point it was 8 pm and out entire group was extremely hungry), and he brought out fried pieces of pita. No butter. No bread. Not even a soft pretzel ( one of the menu items).  All of our water glasses were empty as well. What a waste of time and money! Still waiting for the check too!  We asked for it THIRTY mins ago...",

    "text": "Surprisingly distinctive array of beers.  we sampled twelve  wonderful and unique flavor profiles ranging from a light C.R.E.E.M golden ale brewed with arizona wildflower honey (which gives it a distinctively sweet flavor) to a N.I.B imperial stout aged in a 32 year old rum Bartell with real Vermont syrup.  The gastro grub is delicious and savory, complementing the beers beautifully.  We had a sizable bowl of poutine with short rib over cheese fries and gravy. A foot long Chicago dog, and grilled cheese with tomato bisque. The menu sported a good variety of international bites as well as pizzas and burgers...pretty much what you would expect from a gastropub.  Service was attentive and fast, although server did not make a point of telling us what the beers in the flight were, or make recommendations or walk us through the menu. Personally, when it comes to breweries, I like the purveyors of the beer to be excited about it, talk about, and educate me.  I give the beer 4 stars for sure!!! I think NMB has a very memorable and distinct beerganization!",

    "text": "So I posted a review on here yesterday and was contacted by their Manager/Owner(?) and was told that what I had written was incorrect. I wrote about sour beers and they don't make any sour beers. Yep, totally correct, I mistook this place with another brewery here in Phoenix and I just copied and pasted to that other one. To my knowledge, first time I've ever made this mistake, so....  3 1/2. I came here because I was in the neighborhood and actually tried another craft beer bar but it didn't serve draft beer so I left that place and found this place.  I sat at the bar and ordered a flight of beers, though I only did 6 and not the 8 they offer! Upon recommendation I also ordered the lumpia, which I've never seen on a menu. Well, except at a Filipino place. All the beers are solid and I liked them. I didn't think any beer I had was amazing but I'd definitely come back and drink some more beer. My lumpia was actually way overcooked. The meat inside was literally black inside. I never return food so I didn't say anything.  Well, I struck up a conversation with the gentleman sitting next to me, and he asked me how the lumpia was. So I told him and the bartender overheard me. At this point, I was done with the night and ready to go home so she took away the lumpia. Mind you, I still at about half the plate, maybe a little more, mostly the burnt ones. So when I got the bill she completely removed the lumpia off the bill and only charged me for the beers. That was pretty cool, I honestly wasn't expecting that, though I had every right to say something, but I never do, so it was somewhat serendipity.  So overall I had a pretty good time and I liked the crowd this place attracted. Seemed more the blue-collar type people rather than some of these other craft beer places. Would definitely come back to try more beer and eat other food and adjust my rating appropriately.",

If you love your hops, go here! They have a \"CYRious Double IPA\" which is the king of kings IPA! Seriously. I took a whiff of it and I thought I was smelling a pine tree!   Unfortunately, we both don't like IPAs. But that doesn't mean we will give them a bad review for not having our type of beer. Great place! Good food! And the atmosphere was open.   My advice. If you love IPAs...bring a your friends too. It's made for huge groups of friends to hang out!",

Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to love everything, it wasn't awesome. They had 10 beers listed, but were sold out of 2 (as luck would have it, the 2 my husband wanted to try). We got the 8-beer sampler to try the rest. The dark Belgian was good, but everything else had a super strong coffee/smoke flavor. None of our party of 4 was crazy about them.  The space is cute enough, and huge, and the patio looked nice. Service was friendly and helpful, if not especially quick.  The unexpected bright spot was the salad menu...I had a good kale salad and my mom had the spicy Brussels sprout one.  Glad I tried it, and I may be back in the name of supporting local business.",

I tried the hef and it was very tasty. The husband had the cream and enjoyed it very much, it was kind of sweet for a cream and very tasty. We shared the poutine and it was alright, it consisted of thick cut fries (unlike the fries they serve with sandwiches which are thin), cheese curds, gravy, and short rib. The short rib was good and fairly plentiful, it was cooked to the point where it was falling apart... very nice. The overall flavor of the poutine was good, but not the best I had ever had. Despite this, I would get it again. Additionally, it was only 12$ and was plenty of food for 2 people.  I would certainly come here for the beer again in the future.   PS they had amazing sounding desserts.... def want to try that.",

Awful. I sat for a while and didn't even get looked at...she moves slow and had no real drive.  I finally got a menu from another patron and then she came over. I mean...really. the I ask about the 8$ beer and burger combo for happy hour markers she stares at me..then asks me how I'd  like my burger cooked. I tell her then tell he I'd like a 6$ beer not a 5$ beer on the menu and she told me I couldn't have it cause the buttons on the computer aren't set up that way. Omg. I'm going nuts by this  point and so are the people next to me. I finally get it ordered. Phew!!!   Then she only talks to male patrons and flirts while I'd like another beer. Jeeze.   Good had always been a! Pretzels leave room to be desired but the burgers, poutine, and fish and chips rocks.  In conclusion that bartender sucks!!! Sorry dear.   Also, I don't wanna hear your  business talk about WiFi, if u think table 312 is one the first date cause she's smiling a lot, or how everyone wants to eat at the same time...yeah dinner  time.

Maybe it's not authentic so I would happily be corrected if anyone could point me to a better source locally, that has beer. I think they are safe;)   On a non-food note.

Our group of 3 enjoyed sharing a variety of items in between the marathon of talking and laughing:  Pretzel Bread - In my world, all pretzel bread needs to be served with cheese.  As much cheese as possible.  I get it, not everyone loves cheese as much as I do, but to charge an additional $1 for the smallest ramekin of cheese ever is kind of disappointing.    Poutine - My first time ever having poutine, so I don't have a basis of comparison.  It did seem to have way more gravy than short rib meat and cheese.  More cheese, please!!  Mussels - Favorite thing we tried - a nice portion, with sourdough bread to dip in the savory white wine butter sauce.  Piece of Cake - Cute little dessert, topped with vanilla bean ice cream.  North Mountain Malt - I could have happily taken this all for myself, but was practicing my 'polite' skills.  I would definitely go back, but would smuggle in my own cheese (ssssshhh!!). :)",

I had to order the banh mi like 3 times and point to it on the menu because the server said he didn't know what it was. Once he read the decription, he said \"oh yeah - that's new but its my favorite thing on the menu.\" Wait, what?  We ordered a beer flight, and they don't have any of those cool trays that hold the glasses, or even printed placemats that describe each beer, yet. Maybe if they ever firm up the beer selection they will. The flight wasn't bad - but it had a couple of guest brews in substituting for their brews that they were out of.  Since this is the closest brewpub to our house, I had growlers with me. I didn't even walk out to the car to get one. I was hoping for a nice rich porter to fill them with - and they didn't have any that day.  Their saving grace was the Abita Purple Haze on tap. I like Abita beers, but out of all the beers in the flight we tried...I went with the Abita. That's not how it should work at a brewery, unless your guest beer is something like a Pliny or a Stone rarity.",

Like Fate Brewing, I was less than impressed with their initial offerings but over the course of a couple years in operation the bugs have been worked out and the quality has steadily improved. I would list Fate amongst the top brewpubs in the metroplex now and my hope is that NMB is on the same track. Case in point: I was going to get a flight in order to reassess my opinion of their lineup but the Helles Lager that I started with was so good I ended up drinking it all night. And if they can make a solid lager then that speaks volumes. Not 100% sold on the overall lineup but the technique is there and they are taking chances. A Broyhan on tap? Really? (Similar to a Berliner Weiss) Good variety on the tap list, high quality food with some interesting menu items, nice atmosphere. This isn't a premier beer geek destination just yet but it is showing promise  and I would definitely recommend it if you are in the area and want a well made beer. Concerns: parking is tight during peak hours and the ventilation system doesn't seem to be up to the task so when it's busy the place gets a little smoky from the open kitchen.",

    "text": "This establishment has the framework to be an AWESOME destination eatery/pub  What is needed: (just my little opinion)  1) Play up your selection of micro brews, take a tip from the micro beer pubs in San Diego. Have \"beer menus\" at each table and all over the place,.. write narratives on each brew, describe its flavor nuances, food pairings etc. And for the love of,... jump on the IPA train! Maybe you usually offer an IPA but not available when I stopped in, if you do,.. I suggest you make a BIG deal about it. (this is a deep pool, know whats out there before jumping in)  2) Have a \"Service System\",.. your wait staff seems distracted, inattentive, uninformed about what they offer, and generally confused. (as in not knowing what to do next)  Again, borrowing from other successful operations devise a \"system\" that is centered around what the customer experience is from the time they walk through the door until they wave goodbye. Train your staff to follow the system for each customer. I really believe you can close your gaps in service this way. This is not an easy thing to do but I believe it is critical to the business.  Reviews that are wishy washy and offer no help are useless to me (as a consumer) I hope you feel the same as an operator. That said,.. my review for the masses is below:  Good food, Good Ambiance, sketchy service and Great beer. You should go, support the effort here and be on the team to build this good place into a great place.",

You can order cheese for an additional $1 which we didn't NOT ask for and the waitress gave us and charged us a $1 for, so I deducted a $1 from her tip. I got the Chicken Fundido sandwich which was pretty good, nothing I have to go back & have again though. My husband had the burger with pulled pork on it and said it was below average. I did try the Mead flight and the first 2 were good, the last two...yuck! The outdoor patio is quite small & had poor lighting. It was very hard to see.

They had a open house months before they opened up to show the floor plans etc. This is the closest brewery to my house so I was hoping to have a good experience. I won't go on about the first few months but I stopped coming. Two years ago my wife was in the hospital next door so I thought I'd stop in and have a beer. I sat at the bar for over ten minutes and nobody acknowledged me or said I'll be right with you or nothing. There was a girl that was running around behind the counter but never said I'll be right with you or nothing. The girl that was sitting next to me was laughing and said yeah they don't have very good service here. I ended up leaving. Well it's been almost two years since I've been there so I decided to have dinner there last night. I was sitting out side on the patio and the waiter (I can't remember his name) asked me what I would like. I ordered a beer and the shepherds pie. He asked me if I needed the menu anymore and I said no. About five minutes later he brought me a plate with utensils and napkins. Asked me what kind of beer was that again. I told him and a few minutes later he brought it. About forty minutes later he come by and asked me if I wanted to order some food. I told him I already did and he said oh that's right. Then he started to scramble and said they had a big party and they were behind. Then he brought me another plate with utensils. So after a hour and fifteen minutes I finally called the manager and just wanted to pay for the beer. I drive truck for a living so I never drink more than one when I'm driving. Maybe I've had bad luck here but the customer service is not there.",

I tried the shepherds pie which was featured on the show and was told by the young lady bartending it was one of their signature dishes, it was absolutely delectable, I could've eaten another serving, it was so fabulous. I over ate a little bit and tried the fried banana split, what a way to finish your meal, it was incredible.

I am made to think that this building use to be some kind of auto-shop. They had the one of the 2 big garage doors open to the outside last Saturday night. The place was decked out with Halloween decor, along with all the servers and bartenders. They had a kind of open Mic Night that I think they do quiet often with some very good performers.   The beer was tasty! I had the Peches Et Creme . Their lightest brew but still had flavor. A hint of honey and fruit with a creamy finish. I decided on the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, and I subbed my French fries for the seafood chowder (best idea ever, I highly recommend doing so. Although my husbands shoestring fries were yummy as well.) This sandwich was ok. Nothing special. Not even the \"Bacon Jam.\" I couldn't really taste it. The bun was soft, the chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Your average chicken sandwich. I tried a few bites of my husbands Steak Sandwich. Now this sandwich was very flavorful and man was it spicy. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED! If you aren't scared of a little heat, you should definitely give this one ago with a nice cold beer to cool you down. And the Chowder that I substituted. Oh man... I was kicking myself the next day for not getting some to-go for lunch.  I really liked this brewery and I will be back to try some different beer's and food items. And to get some of that chowder before it's gone!",

The stout is the only one I'd ever order again.   Each time I've gone, I've had a flight of every beer that I hadn't already tried. The flight of 6 is $14! I didn't even end up drinking more than 1 full taster. Keep in mind these are a little bit larger than normal tasters. I should have had the mead flight instead.   Never mind the high price of the flight, the food is outrageously expensive for a brewery. I couldn't get even a side to snack on for less than $7. They have a great quality menu, I don't doubt that, but it's not budget friendly by any means and the beer price certainly doesn't make up for it. I haven't walked out under $20 for a quick bite/beer stop once.   The bartenders aren't the friendliest. Last time I asked for a beer menu and she pointed to the wall and walked away. Then her friends, or regulars rather, walked in to sit at the bar and they asked for one and she handed it right to them. They were also asked for beers before I was as well.   The waitresses gossip at the end of the bar  while waiting for their drinks very loudly about how annoying their customers were being. It went something like, \"Table x over there is so annoying, she wanted x with a side of x and I thought, you're so stupid!\" It was just catty and unnecessary. I wouldn't mention this because I vent about my customers too once in a while, but it's happened all three times I've been here with different girls on different days. Not cool.",

We bought beers inside to get out of the heat for a lil. The CREEM was my favorite. They had a chocolate sour that wasn't really up any of our alleys. But I'm not a sour fan anyways. They gave us the saison in like a tiny almost Dixie cup. I understand it's a higher ABV but don't charge $7 for such a lil cup. The vendors n artists outside varied from T-shirts, jewelry, paintings, n such. We didn't have any food. Might come back after checking out other breweries in the area.",

They had a cover band playing at a reasonable volume but there is no ambiance music playing when the band takes a break so it does get a little eerily quiet.   It's \"family style\" seating. So you could be sharing your large table with others. They do have a bar top which you can sit at, and a patio with heaters.  Our server seemed a little lost or new and would disappear at times. We asked for samples of a few of their beers and she gave us the wrong ones. We decided to get the Soiled Dove Dirty Blonde Ale and another one I can't remember. Both were just ok.  Appetizer - we ordered the Lumpia which are little \"spring rolls\" with pork, veggies and a really good peanut sauce. I believe 8 came with the order. $7  Main Course - North Mountain Burger w/ fries $14  and Fish and Chips $12. The  Fish and Chips didn't taste like they had been sitting in a freezer forever. The tarter sauce wasn't your normal tarter sauce but it was delicious - hints of mustard in it. The food came out quickly and hot. Nothing to rave about but it was good.  I would come here again if it was on my way to my destination or near me, definitely wouldn't seek this place out as my first choice.",

    "text": "I am typically not at a loss for words for a review, but this place is jaw droppingly  WOW.  Atmosphere: If any of you have ever read Jim Butcher's Dresden Files? Welcome to Macanally's Pub. 13 Wood Tables in the joint, 13 chairs at the bar, 13 Air Conditioning vents. (I'm a nerd so sue me), but the best part? Steak Sandwiches! We will get to that in a minute though. It was a casual relaxed atmosphere, the staff was extremely friendly, and we even took our 5 year old and he had a blast. (Note: There were other kids in there, and it wasn't awkward). I would LOVE to have a board game night here. The tables and atmosphere are PERFECT for it.  Food: We started off with the Pretzel Bread (Its a bread stick right out of the oven that is a Pretzel) with what I can only assume to be made from scratch mustard, butter, and beer cheese. My husband and I fought over the mustard and beer cheese. Then dinner came. My husband had the Poutine (Cheese Curds, Braised Short Ribs, Fries and Gravy)...let me tell you...this was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.....until I had my steak sandwich. This thing was straight from the Dresden Files. Fresh Bread, excellent steak, onions, peppers, and a gravy that would make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head. This thing was heavenly. As a side, we got the loaded mac and cheese. DO THIS. Just trust me, you are going to look at it and say ..peas? Seriously? Shut up and do it. I don't know who the chef is there, but BRAVO! The little man had their Pepperoni Flat bread Pizza and though  Drink: My husband and I ordered a flight of beer. My favorite was the Creem (spelled correctly) and the Stout. You may be sitting here nodding, but let me explain. ....I loathe stout beer. I hate it, I wont drink it. I would drink their stout by the pitcher. One warning it is rich, sip responsibly. The hubby enjoyed their lager, and the Creem as well as others.   Hands down if you have not been to this place, you need to go NOW. It was absolutely amazing, and we will be returning customers.",

When paying the tab, server told us that we could not use our tickets on the restaurant tab. Isn't the money all going to the same place? The brewery? The server told us that the owner said we could return our tickets for our cash back at the tent. When returning the tickets at the tent we received a lot of attitude from the man working there. A lady who was also also at the tent, piped up with \"oh...you're the lady who returned the burger\". Yes ma'am, the raw burger. Will never return after the shitty customer service.

A few weeks ago we went and the beer selection was limited- they were out of  some of their beers.  The beer they did have was just OK.  I get that beer takes time and maybe they are still trying to judge volume, but the quality of beer has also gone down hill.   Wanting to really like this place and support business in our neighborhood, we tried it again last night.  Beer is notably worse and they have updated the menus to try and explain why there is an inconsistency and call it \"rotating taps\".  What I got out of this was, \"we can't figure out how to make our beers (listed on the menu) consistently so we will pour whatever comes out of the batch.\"    We have not tried much of the food menu.  But this is a brewery, the beer should be the focus, right?  Oh, forgot to mention our server last night.  She disappeared and we had to go to the bar to get our check.  Luckily one of the servers sitting at the bar knew her employee ID and could print it for us.  They couldn't find her either.",

I was impressed with NMBC, the interior was awesome, I loved seeing the stills and the whole rear wall is doors that open to a patio that were open. Our waiter was kick ass and was the epitome of customer service. There was some great live music going on and it wasn't some horrible hipsters. Now, as I said, I do not drink beer so I had a coke. It took me awhile to read the menu to decide what to eat, everyone raved about the crab dip and said the chicken sandwich and burgers were not worth eating. I decoded to get the all-meat 7\" pizza and damnit, that was a FANTASTIC choice. Though I do not drink beer, I will come back for the atmosphere and the pizza. I gave 5 stars for the pizza.",

I had the creem. Simple. Lighter ale. Great beer for drinking in the Arizona sun out on their patio.  My boyfriend had the Hoy ipa. It was a very aromatic beer with a strong hoppy flavor.  Overall we liked the place. The patio was small but functional. Their menu looked good but was a little pricey. Our one criticism was that it was hard to tell if they were open. The need an open sign street side and their Parking is out back which took some hunting to find.",

I enjoyed my first visit, mostly because of some great company.  We shared appetizers.  Up first...pretzel bread.  How can you go wrong with that?  By not making cheese sauce a standard accompaniment.  You can add for a buck, so we made it clear we wanted a lot of it.  A vat of it, the more the better.  We received a thimbleful of cheese, for three women who love cheese.  That would be like serving us a shot of wine.  We also had the mussels and poutine.  The mussels were yummy and bathed in a white wine butter sauce.  Wine and butter together.  Who could ask for more?  The poutine was good, but needed more short rib and more cheese curds.  Now we're back on the cheese thing.  We finished with the North Mountain malt and a piece of cake.  Loved them both.  Would order either again.  Maybe because they don't require cheese.  First impression didn't make me a huge fan, but I would go back if in the area again.  They have a great menu!",

The interior was decent, although I didn't need to see the entire kitchen area, which was directly behind the bar. Otherwise, the decor was cute, and I liked that there was outdoor seating for those sunny days. As far as the beer, we were not impressed. It isn't bad, but nothing stood out and had that rich or unique flavor we're used to from all of the other places across the valley. If you're an IPA fan, I suggest looking elsewhere. A flight of all 8 beers cost $14, a bit steep in my opinion. Overall, an okay place to stop if you're in the area, but not really worth going out of your way for.",

We came on a Saturday night and I was impressed with the set up. We sat at the bar which has a view of the kitchen and there was a small band playing.  While sitting at the bar we were met with a friendly bartender that knew all of the beers and seemed to really enjoy his work. Wish I would have caught his name.   Ordered the IPA which was really good. Tried my friend's brown and it was really good as well. We also tried the loaded Mac and cheese and it was awesome!  I've heard that the food here is really good.   Overall I will come back to NMBCo. Seems like a good place to eat dinner with a great beer or just a place to enjoy a beer or two with friends.

NMBco has a lot going for it.  1) The neighborhood - There isn't a ton of competition in this area of town and it is awesome to have a micro brewery this close to where I love. 2) Good quality beer 3) Live music 4) Very nice wait staff 5) The place is bright and clean  It is lacking in a couple areas though...  1) While the quality of the beer is good, I just didn't get the flavor complexity I wanted.  Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the beer, but is NMBco is going to compete with the other local heavy hitters on taste, they will need tweak their beers just a little. 2) I didn't try a lot of food but the food wasn't terribly great even by pub standards.  Make a good burger, make good fish and chips, and have a really solid pretzel...  If you have to go out with friends and don't feel like going to Sun Up, Four Peaks, Papago, etc.. this is a solid alternative.  Me?  I will just go buy some good bottle and hang out on my porch with friends, did I mention that Sprout's carries Dogfish Head bears now?  That's an IPA i can get behind!",

I appreciated the fact that they didn't have a bunch of cutesy flavored beers like a lot of other local breweries.   All the beer was good to very good. Our favorite was the Bonita Saison (available seasonally) with a close second being the Far West IPA.   We also shared an order of fries. They were thin and very crispy with a dusting of herbs. Based on this limited food experience, I would definitely like to try the rest of the menu. Our server was prompt, friendly and casual.

They had a good variety of beer available everyone found something they liked. We added this place to our list of yummy places to take out of town guest.",

Food prepared as requested and arrives within a timely manner. I like it but I'm giving it 3 stars because of some recent orders I placed for take away--there's a big disconnect with what's served on location and what's acceptable for customers picking up. Food was soggy (sandwiches!!! Sandwiches can't be soggy), fries just sad, wilted lettuce in salad, the hardest avocado slices known to man.",

I wouldn't have guessed it exist simply because I don't travel to that part of Phoenix often. However, I'm glad I had the opportunity to visit this locally own brewery!  North Mountain focuses on what they call Beercentric foods; or foods that are inspired by beers.    I came on a Sunday afternoon brunch with a gang of a 7 and went for the beer flights right away.  I'm not much of a beer drinker anymore, but I can say the beers I ordered were definitely tasty and each had it's own character; some sweet, some floral, and some strong like whiskey!  Overall, I really enjoyed their beers.  However, I'm a food guy so let's get started!    I wasn't too hungry the day I attended, but they seemed to have some mouthwatering dishes; Poutine breakfast, Chicken & Waffles, and Skillet Scrambles.  Today I ordered the North Mountain Scramble with over-easy egg.  Overall, the sausage and bacon beneath was cooked to perfection with the oozing of the egg; gave this dish welcoming brunch bite with every sip of beer!  What I also appreciate about the dish I ordered was the size; it wasn't overly huge to the point where I had to take some home.  All the other dishes seemed pretty big, but I guess I picked it right this time around! - Enjoy!",

Whatevs.  I get seated almost immediately and was served the Buddha-something beer, I forget but it wasn't bad at all! The waitress was nice and super swift, and almost literally because she was darting back and forth from kitchen/bar pass to dining...  ...which leads me to believe they were understaffed. I sipped on my beer and it was almost gone, when my food finally came. About 15-20 min wait.  My Southwest burger was luke warm at very best...flavor was meh. It had to have been sitting at an unheated pass for a little bit. The fries....I have no clue if these were even fries...they're crunchy strings of blah!  Mainly the good beer and the fast-and-best-we-can service on this given night is what kept this from a lower rating. Unsure if I'll be back, and I'm currently local to this part of town.",

The chicken wings were seasoned and flavored to perfection with a crispness on the outer skin--blue cheese and ranch dressing on the side for dipping, baked macaroni & cheese with a smoky Gouda on the top and several different types of flatbread pizzas that were very tasty. We were given a tour of the brewery where the magic happens by the owner/master brewer and another master brewer. He explained how they make the crafted brews, going into detail about it all comes together. The restaurant is clean and popular with the locals. It is a friendly, comfortable environment. It was a very nice evening and we will be back.",

Well, I went back with a friend because he hasn't been there yet and I do have to say that the menu has been revamped quite a bit and actually had quite a few things that I wanted. Also, they have a couple of IPAs on the menu, which was a huge improvement from last time.  I will be going back soon to try the pizza.",

The pretzel bread, with the honey butter, mustard and cheese is a super tasty appetizer. I just wish it came with four pretzels instead of three.  The poutine - so delicious! The short ribs just fall apart, the cheesy, gravy amazingness is just...so, so good. If you're a first timer, I highly recommend the poutine.  The meat pizza, meh. It was okay, nothing to write home about, although we got the pizza in the same visit as the poutine, so it didn't really stand a chance.  We also ordered a beer sampler in our first visit to get an idea of what we liked and we didn't. The glasses for the sampler are HUGE, we shared them amongst a few people and we were all able to get a few sips. I personally enjoy the C.R.E.E.M. beer, nice and light.  The nice thing about this place is the live entertainment. Every time we've been there was a group playing, and the music was enjoyable but not overpowering.   They have indoor and outdoor seating, inside they also have some large communal style tables to sit at, which can be sort of fun.  I think this will definitely be our go to happy hour joint in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "Visited North Mountain Brewing Company the other night on a whim. (A friend's whim, actually.) It wasn't until I arrived that I realized I had been there once before a couple of years ago to watch a different friend of mine perform live with her band.  I remembered this as I walked up to the entrance and, sure enough, was greeting by the sound of live music playing again as I entered. Being a musician myself, and long-time lover of live music, this was an instant hit for me. I found a seat and got comfortable.  The first time I ever visited North Mountain Brewing Company, I didn't order any food, just a beer. It was so long ago that I can't remember having any impressions of the beer one way or another. I just remember liking the feel of the place.  This time, I was here for dinner. AND a beer. So, as I sat at a small table for two in the very center of the room, surrounded by the sounds of acoustic ambiance, I began to peruse the beer and food menus as if for the very first time.  I was impressed to find so many original beers on the menu. Good ones, too - including the beer that I ordered which was an Imperial Red IPA. YUMM!!! My friend ordered a red ale, which was equally delicious in its own way.  We were helped by a pretty young server named Alisa. She was super helpful and more than willing to answer all our questions. I made a point of getting her name off the receipt so that I could mention her in this review. She was great.  My friend ordered the Fish & Chips, and I ordered the Poutine at Alisa's recommendation. Both entrees were tasty, although not as standout as the beer, in my opinion. I'd rate both entrees a 4 out of 5, but my friend really enjoyed her Fish & Chips.  Overall, the experience was a win. I plan to go back and try more off the food menu. I'm especially excited to go back and try more off the BEER menu. (I drove from North Scottsdale and that alone is worth the trip.)  If you haven't been to North Mountain Brewing Company, I'd recommend it based on my experience there. If you're really lucky, you'll get Alisa as your server. Make it even more interesting and find a time when they're playing live music (they do this often).  Thank you, North Mountain Brewing, for creating some truly enticing beers. (Probably some of my favorite in the Valley currently.) And thank you, Alisa, for such outstanding service. I'll look forward to seeing you all again soon.  :)",

Had a burger special, girlfriend had some kind of \"Asian \" sliders. My burger was cooked as ordered, but had zero flavor. Her sliders were far better, but not out of this world. Menu seems to offer a lot, so we'll delve deeper next time.   AZ beers are typically terrible, but the 6 house brews we tried were decent. They seem to produce a lot of varieties, so I'm sure I can find 1-2 that are worth ordering again.   Happy hour pricing is very reasonable.This was a nice find.

This place has great potential and I hope it helps to revitalize the neighborhood around it.",

Staff is very friendly, atmosphere is somewhat German in that there are long tables next to each other so strangers get to mix if wanted. Walls also have TV's all across with Sports on them. Got a Flight of 6 beers, I'm not an IPA fan and don't like Hoppy beers, so I wont comment on them, there was a CREME that was very tasty. We had the sausage plate and ham and cheese (it had bacon in it). Food was good and priced right, if Im in the area I will see them again.",

Not sure who the musican was but amazing flute playing (think jethro tull)! Only reason it's not getting 5 stars is it's a bit loud when you have a large group talking together and the waitress started out letting us know the beer specials were on some wall when you enter the building rather than just telling us or giving a specialty menu. Kinda strange but you easily get past it with their good service and food. Btw had the heffiweisen beer. Yum.",

The bar was lined with fans watching football games on the televisions, a few small groups were scattered around the room talking and outside a couple guys were smoking pipes, which smelled great.  Very relaxed.  Our server checked in regularly and gave generous samples of the beers we were interested in trying.  The brewery's own beers were very good.  Food was great.  The pretzel rolls with beer cheese and house mustard were average, but the daily special soup, a green chile and potato mixup, tasted exceptional, despite being very bland visually.  The sausage platter was delicious and came with generous portions of sausages cooked to perfection.  My wife had the waffle and enjoyed it.  Their beef sandwich was very much Philli-style and, although not nearly as good as a real-deal cheesesteak, it was tasty and filling.  The price of food and appetizers are a bit on the high side, which is my only major complaint, if I had to have one.  Beers had a wide range of prices, but were generally decent and the limited, but well diversified selection was nice.  I plan to visit North Mountain Brewing Co. again very soon.  Recommended!",

    "text": "So I have returned to NMB several times since my review.  Things are getting better and I'm realizing that it's better to drink mediocre craft beer than drink mass produced beer found in most bars in Phoenix.   Was there over the weekend with other people that had been to NMB previously as well.  The pretzel bread is quickly turning into a favorite for all of us.    I've been to brew pubs all over the country and one thing that NMB needs to do is have 3-4 of their best beers on tap at all time.  Then rotate another 3 or so seasonal beers.  Couple of people in my group were hoping to grab a beer that wasn't on tap.   Also guessing that good help is hard to find.  On one trip to NMB I went right after work, which at most places is when it starts to get busy.  The bartender did check on all of us before taking off for 5 minutes for a smoke.  In those 5 minutes a few other people showed up to the bar and had to wait until the bartender came back.  If it's close to 6 PM your bar should be staffed.  Noticed that your employees like to use their cell phones while working.  Had to wait for another employee while they finished up a phone call.    But will keep going back, it's a nice little spot in a part of town that could use a good bar.",

They are still working some of the kinks out, but nothing major and I'm sure that with a few more months under their belts it will be a smooth operation. The food is very tasty, but I can't recommend eating here - it is just too expensive.  So to wrap it up, fun, open, inviting place to hang out at and the tables are huge, so invite your friends or better yet make some new friends. Once the food prices/portion sizes are adjusted this could be the go to place. I really hope NMB can make a go of it, the Sunnyslope neighborhood could really use a few more fun spots like this.",

They were a bit slammed the evening we stopped in to try it out - in their defense, it was the night of the art walk in Sunnyslope - so service was a bit slow but understandable given the volume of patrons pouring in the door.   We enjoyed the beer sampler - my fave was the stout!  We decided to share a few dishes - the burger n fries, the brussels sprouts and the crab dip.  All were just delicious!  Looking forward to trying some of the salads offered on the seasonal menu too!  The atmosphere is comfortable, open and very friendly.  We'll be back...with friends!

We sat outside, ordered a beer and our food.  The beer was good and delivered promptly.  We order a burger and pizza and proceeded to wait for over 45 minutes for our food. The server did come back several times to tell us there were several large orders in front of us.  There were barely 30 people total on the inside and there were 3 cooks working the kitchen.  We were just getting ready to ask for our check for the beers and leave when she brought the food out.  The only thing that saved the evening was the food was good and the server was very friendly and apologetic about the long wait.

Sometimes when I go there I'm not even hungry but then I hear Liz describe the burger, my mouth just waters. It is family friendly, I bring my kids there and even they want to know, Where's Liz? .

(It's also not too far from Castles N' Coasters, which makes it a good place to go for dinner before putt-putt golf as a cute little date night ;))   To start, we decided to share a beer flight, so we got four beers each - for only $15! I wish I could remember exactly which ones we tried, but I do know that the Spiral Man Oatmeal Stout was by far my favorite! If you're into stouts, especially the coffee, oatmeal or chocolate-type ones, I think you'll really enjoy this one as well.   We also had the Pretzel Bread appetizer, and that was delicious. I thought the House Mustard was very good, better than the average mustard you get with pretzels. The honey butter was also great, and normally I don't even like sweet stuff on pretzels. (Since I'm not used to liking things like that, I kind of just forgot about it and only used it once, and that was a mistake lol). We also got the cheese sauce for $1 extra. The waiter told us it was worth the extra dollar and he was right! It was way too salty though; we both had to scrape most of the salt off. I would recommend asking for it with light or no salt!  For dinner with both got the Fish & Chips. My boyfriend thought they were pretty good, but me not so much. Mine were kinda soggy and just pretty average overall. The fries were fairly average as well, but the remoulade they come with instead of tartar sauce was yummy!   I'm not sure we would rush back here for the food, but we'll definitely be back for the beer :)",

    "text": "Found this hidden gem by searching Yelp and entering a zip code. My friend was craving fish and chips. So happy we chose this place. Fish and Chips were delish according to him. Husband had the special burger of the week. Jalapeno Popper Burger. He said it was very tasty.  My girlfriend and I had the Garlic, Herb and Ale Shrimp. It was described as Sauteed Shrimp with a savory Garlic and C.R.E.E.M Golden Ale sauce serve with sourdough crostini.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly but there was a slight tang. We asked the waitress if cilantro was in there and she said yes. I think they could have left out the cilantro. The toast was thin slices. Could have made the bread a bit thicker. But over all it was good. We had about a 20 minute wait for our food but it came out hot. There weren't many people when we got there around 1:30 but the place was filling up quickly while we were there and more were going in as we were leaving. And this was on a Saturday.  We had a great waitress who talked us through the beer menu and was pretty attentive. We will go back.",

We have been pretty spoiled with awesome restaurants when we visit so I might be starting to raise my bar on stars here. And again, nothing wrong here, just nothing I would tell someone to go try it.

The menu and options are fine, but we have tried a few things - and they were just okay.

It's worth another visit - if only because everyone there is a delight.",

Tried the lumpia egg rolls which would probably have been great if the oil wasn't dirty oil and they were not over done on the outside. My buddy had the fish fry which is Alaskan cod but there was an immense amount of breading on it and for 3 pieces and shoe string fries not worth the cost and I had the poutine which was delicious however it wasn't a lot of beef ( they put beef and cheese curd over French fries with a gravy ) as for beers or anything I can't include those cuz neither my friend nor I drink . We just thought that the menu looked appealing. The beers looked ( according to description) pretty tasty but the food ( or at least the fryer oil should have been cleaned) probably won't be back",

For the beers, I liked the IPA and the baby Belgian. The Hefeweizen, C.r.e.e.m., and stout were good as well and worth trying. Overall, this place is still young, and as such, has some things that could use work, but there is definitely some great things they are doing and are have a bright future ahead of them.",

Saying all of this the reason that I can only give three stars is because the last three times we have gone in the service has been less than outstanding. Three times ago we waited for quite a while for a server to take our order and then after finally getting our drinks we had to ask for our server two times just to get refills. Two times ago it was a similar story and last night we waited over 10 min for our server to acknowledge us even though she (and 3 other servers) had walked by making eye contact.   Last night once we got our beers things got better and as always the food was outstanding.   It is a shame that poor service is making us think twice about going to what was becoming our favorite neighborhood spot.",

I don't know if it was a bad day or I chose the wrong meal but I ordered the small roasted vegetable Flatbread pizza, it had no sauce, was dry,  overcooked.

They have beers that they are constantly brewing on site and switching out the menu constantly. I ended up talking to the bartender or a good amount of time and he invited us to the back where one of the brewers gave us a private tour and breakdown on how the beers are brewed, step by step.  If you're a beer enthusiast, like myself, I would suggest checking out the beer flights to get a little taste of everything. One of my personal favorite was the James Brown Ale?i think that was the name.  I really want to come back when they have live music. It was a great experience and I can't wait to go back!",

I'm a vegetarian, so I rarely go into restaurants with much hope - however they have THE BEST brussel sprouts and cauliflower!  They prepare them in a skillet and are SO GOOD.  The pretzel & cheese is solid also.  I dislike hoppy beer and fortunately they have a great selection.  I had a heffe here which is my favorite.....a great clove taste at the end that makes it especially tasty.  But...what really makes everything come together here is the service.  People are so friendly and they really seem to be proud of the beer!  They love to talk about how it's different than other beers - and have such loyalty to the master brewer.....you can't help but want to support this place.",

The food here is amazing, and their lumpia is some of the best I have ever had in my life, and I'm Filipino so I know good lumpia when i taste it. They were perfectly crispy, superbly rolled, and served with a delicious thai sauce in addition to the traditional sweet & sour. The grilled cheese and chicken sandwich were also both excellent.  I love IPAs and their Ipacious definitely didn't disappoint. Full of hops, just like I like it, and served in a proper 16 oz pint glass. My only recommendation to the restaurant is to add more IPAs to the lineup because you did such a phenomenal job with the Ipacious. Cheers!",

I don't remember what I had then, but I liked their beer.  Last Friday I went again for a UYE.  Our server was fabulous, really nice,  I like light beers, but with a little taste, not bitter.  He let me sample a couple he suggested and our host let me taste the Hefe Endings, which is the one I was eyeing.  I ended up with the Hefe.  My husband and I shared the southwest burger, we usually do that because most burgers lately are so gigantic and I don't need that many calories, don't get me wrong, I can finish it, I am just trying to be a little more conscious now that my metabolism is not as it used to be.  Well this burger is not that big.  It is pretty tasty and spicy (in a good way if you like spicy), but is not gigantic, its average size and I needed something extra, so my husband asked for the asian pulled pork sliders.  Not my favorite.  I am glad they are small and I had one, my husband could take the rest.  The ambiance is really nice and since we had a great group, I had a very good time.",

Much better then some of the other new breweries I've been to recently. For an app, we split the crab dip and it was good, but could have used more crackers, otherwise, creamy and tasty and chunks of crab. I had the fish n chips for dinner and that was very good too, not too big of a portion but with the appetizer, it was perfect. My child ordered the corn dog and fries, very good, not a carnival type corn dog, it was very good. I may get that next time. My girlfriend ordered a burger, unfortunately it was overcooked, she said it was tasty but she likes them medium rare and this was medium and then some. The service was great, our waitress was friendly, knew the menu, and attentive. We'll be coming back, hopefully after they get the last of their beers they offer on the menu.",

No noticeable aroma, and much darker than any IPA should be, it is a Pale Ale after all?  But a great taste with a bitter bite.  The Pale Ale while again had very little aroma, was still a very good beer.  We had the great pretzels.  Everything they were talked up to be!  Also had the wings and the flatbread pizza.  The wings were tasty, but a bit under cooked, although blackened on the outside.  The flatbread also came out a bit over cooked.  The flatbread could serve 2-4 people, much bigger than expected.  We be back!  A great addition to the neighborhood.",

This is the exact email I sent to the brewery after leaving this establishment about my \"experience\" which has yet to be acknowledged :  Pretty disappointed by last night's experience. Or lack there of. We got to the brewery a few minutes before what I was told was our \"reservation\" time and just shortly after a party of 4 had gotten there. I heard the host tell the party that since they did not have a ''reservation\", it would be about a 30-40 minute wait. The party moved aside to discuss if they wanted to wait or not. The host then ignored my husband and I for 5 minutes while she conversed with 3 other employees all who seemed to not have a care in the world. When we finally got her attention she found our name on the \"reservation\" list and informed us it would still be at least 30/45 minutes before we could be sat. Now longer than the group who walked in before us that didn't have a \"reservation\". We have no problem over looking minor service issues,especially at a new place, when dining out, but when it comes at the expense of wasting our entire evening, that's just inexcusable. Why bother taking reservations? Scratch that, why email me and ask me if I'd like to have a reservation for your establishment if you have no intention of honoring it. Sure you maybe thinking, \"we were going to honor it, just 45 minutes late\"... Which means it would take me how long to get food and beer after arriving at this imaginary table? Also 30/45 minutes? Lame.   So I have yet to get a response...  Forget this small place with crap parking. Go to Fate, or Angels Trumpet, or Sun Up, or Phoenix Ale House, or Sleepy Dog, or Four Peaks, or Gordon Biersch, or hell, drive the hour to Sedona or Pine and visit one of their many breweries. All of them will be more than happy to provide you with wonderful beer & food with out a \"reservation\"... Just don't bother here.",

Did not even say hello or , \"thanks for stopping come back at 4.\". Didn't really seem to give a sh** about our business or NO business.  So 4 Peaks welcomed up with smiles and thanks for our hard earned $'s.  save your time, attitude seems to go in line with many of the other reviews.

Which seemed strange, dont you think that as soon as you open the kitchen should be ready to go?    I had a bad feeling when seeing that the place was packed and the Kitchen was going to crash.  I was right, it Crashed!! because 90% of the people ordered food all at once. It took forever to get our food, and when it arrived not eveything came out. It happened to all the other tables around us. The fries were luke warm and boy did they scrimp on the portions.  It seemed that they \"stood at the door\" and threw just a handful to the plate with the fish!!  One of our friends didnt even get his Fish and Chips, apparently was taken to the wrong table. I think their portions should be bigger and its misleading when on the menu it says \"Large Plates\", because you expect a big plate of food.  That certainly was not the case.   It seemed liked they really were not prepared. They were disorganised, lack of training and communication.  Servers not knowing the correct table numbers therefore delivering wrong food. A big cluster!!!  The Chef should pre shift the servers before opening letting them know what they didnt have on the menu. Our server came back to us twice because what we had ordered they did not have.   Would also recommend Salt,Pepper,Sauce Caddy's on the tables. Napkins and Clean Polished Siverware would be nice. We had to ask for all that.    Other than that the place had a good atmosphere, the beer tasted great.  Would like to see this place to be sucessfulI, however they will need to  improve with service and food.   Maybe we will come back in a few weeks to give them another chance and hope they have worked out these issues.",

This is not rocket science, you are getting a bowl, filling it with ice, cracking open the oysters, sticking them in the bowl, with a few condiments. Same for the soft pretzel that took 45 minutes...seriously people, the waitress or \"cook\" could be doing some of this while the sous chef make the main meals...to put this into perspective when we go there they had 15 people there max, but it took 45 minutes for pretzels.....over an hour for the meal, 30++ minutes for TWO oysters???

When the waitress started to avoid us we knew something was wrong. Finally after 45 minutes our food arrived.  My burger was decent but a little dry; it certainly wasn't the medium rare that I had ordered & it was definitely not worth the wait but after 45 minutes and some beer sampler I really needed some food.

The service was a tad slow, but I think they are still working out the kink; however, everyone was very friendly. I especially liked the tour of the brewery, the live music and the cool seating style. I think the Patio will be nice to enjoy once the temps are cooler. I'll be back...Looks like a great place for Sunday Funday.",

I'm 5 months pregnant, and the impact I the stonewear plate hurt me. The waitress brought out another salad, but I sent it back having lost my appetite. My father who paid our bill was too much of a gentleman to say a word about the full bill he got including charges for the salad. Later that night we were talking about the salad spill. I asked him if they took the salad off the bill. He told me they didn't but we just won't ever come back bc \"the food wasn't good anyway\". I was so disappointed. I called and complained about such poor customer service. I was told \"they would try to comp our bill before it closes out in the computer\"  but that's not even the point or why I called. Take a lesson on customer service, please! Your other reviews widely mention poor customer service. Clearly a problem. Never returning",

He chatted with us about the brewery, the beers and even walked us through the brew house showing us the fermenters, brew kettle, mash tun, etc. I thought it was super cool.   I had a beer that I believe was a Belgian wit and my girlfriend had their stout that was 12.3% which made me happy because she only had one. I didn't like the stout but she did. I loved my beer. We had the Chicago dog and chicken wings. Both were amazing!   We will definitely be back again to help support another awesome local brewery and business!",

We finally had to say something to management but the night was ruined. As great as your beer may be you must provide a pleasant experience with great service.   We may give it one more chance.

    "text": "Wow! I haven't written a review for North Mountain yet? I love this place!  Impressions: On entry you come in off a lot which shares it's space with a few other businesses. One may not expect the beauty within from the exterior without.  Once you enter through the double doors, you see a window which shows you the fermenting towers they are using to brew the delicious beers they serve. You take a turn to the right, and see a high vaulted dining room with a bar directly to your left. Several long tables adorn the center, with a few smaller tables to either side. To the back are garage style doors which exit into a patio.   Food and Drink: The food is great here! I am slightly upset that they got rid of their Sausage platter, however I would suggest the wings any day of the week. Order the house hot though, not the franks hot, those you can get anywhere.  As far as beer, I recommend you find out which one you like for yourself. They serve flights, so you can try several at one setting without killing your ability to function safely later. My favorites are usually their nut browns.   Service: Service is good here. There have been a few occasions where I've had to wait a few minutes before they came to my table, however this place is almost always busy. I've never had a bad time, and often times if there's an issue, the employees fix it very quickly.  As it says in the starting sentence, I love this place. It's delicious, owned by dog lovers, and is just a shot down from my favorite bar in town. If you haven't tried this place, I would tell you, you are missing out.",

I was super excited when I saw they had carne asada fries on the menu (my favorite food ever). It comes with melty nacho cheese, pico de gallo, fresh carne asada, red onions and jalapenos. So delicious and it warms you as a whole. As for my boyfriend, he typically would get a Shepard's pie or fish and chips. He has to keep me away from his food cuz it's so delicious! He also orders the hemp ale. He loves it and orders it often. Even as someone who doesn't drink, I really liked the hemp ale!   Wait staff is always sweet and helpful. Food and beer is always delicious. There's also outside seating where you can bring your dog if you'd like. Definitely one of my fave places to eat in Phoenix!",

My 12 yo son got the beer bbq wings and loved them. I tried one and agree the sauce was amazing. I had a cup of chilled tomato soup which was fantastic.  My husband ordered the Thai pizza and it was the perfect size for him with me having 1.5 pieces.  Their beer options were plentiful.

It was the North Mountain burger which comes with white cheddar, mustard, spicy aoli, lettuce, tomato, onion & pickles. Fries had a nice, perfect crispy.

I asked if it was made in-house and she let us know that it was. It is insanely wonderful.  Then she went about introducing us to her granddaughter who was manning the bar along with others that she called \"adopted grandchildren\".  Refreshing, to say the least, knowing it was a family owned and ran establishment.  I always stick with a lager/pils/kolsch style beer and they always have one on tap.

    "text": "What a wonderful find, right under our noses!  Why hadn't we come in before?  NMB is located in a convenient but unusual area.  To the east is a pretty trashy neighborhood around Dunlap and 12th.  To the north is the gorgeous North Mountain area and Point Tapatio.  That's why one can easily miss this place and drive right by it.  It's across the street from a cell tower camouflaged as a palm tree and catty corner from a funeral parlor.  But, once you walk inside, you're inside a lively and HUGE real, actual brewpub.  There are tanks behind the very large bar and a very big beer-hall sized restaurant.  The real test is the beer though, right?  NMB wins in the beer category.  The C.R.E.E.M. is listed as #1 on the menu and rightly so.  It's a gorgeous, creamy ale.  Did I not already mention how CREAMY it tastes?  Unreal.  Unlike a lot of PHX brewery's there's actually a lot for vegetarians, gluten free and paleo type people to eat here.  Paleo and beer?  Well, sure, they aren't really compatible, but if you want to go carb free for the food, you can.  There's also a black bean burger for the veg people and huge veggie sides for the no-carb folks too.  Gluten free people might be able to do the fried rice unless the soy sauce is a problem.  I think I covered it all for the alt food people. ;-)  I guess I should mention that my Salted Caramel Ale (or whatever it's actually called - they say it's made with homemade caramel) was very, very good.  It was rich like a porter, but less chocolatey.  I loved it.  I like the fact that you can get 9 oz beers here.  I don't want a big pint.  I like to take tastes.  They also have 8 beer flights for $15.  NMB is a keeper.",

    "text": "Well, the hubby and I were up in North Phoenix a couple weekends ago and I just had to stop in and check out North Mountain Brewing Co. I had bookmarked them after stopping by their booth at the Strong Beer Festival in February but they are pretty far from where we live so I hadn't gotten around to paying them a visit even though I have seen some pretty good reviews from fellow Yelpers. Unfortunately we had just had a huge meal so we did not sample any of the food but I did try all four beers that they had on tap that day. Their production facility is pretty small so they don't make a whole lot but the nice thing is they do also keep some other local brews on tap so you are sure to find something you would like to drink.  I tried the four that they make themselves. First off was their Funk 49 wheat ale, similar to a Hefeweizen but with a bit more flavor. It was a nice light beer, perfect for summer, and had a pleasant mild taste with a crisp citrus aftertaste. Hubby ordered one of those put an orange in it, as he is wont to do. Next we tried the CREEM Ale. This one was a bit lighter than I was expecting but surprisingly enough I really liked it and ended up ordering a pint. I can't remember how they categorized it but to me it was like a very mild red ale but with some really strong caramel undertones. We also tried their pale ale which as expected was a bit too hoppy for me and their Nonpartisan lager which also as expected was too tasteless (nothing against NMB, I just don't care for pale ales or lagers). I look forward to trying their stout some day since that one sounds great!  We had a great time chatting with the friendly bartender. Everyone working there seemed really nice and they greeted most folks by name as they entered (it was the middle of the day so they were not busy). Even though the interior looks brand spanking new and everything was pretty shiny and modern, it still had a homey feel to it since the space was small and very open. Also, the smells coming from the kitchen were mouth watering and their menu looks fantastic. I love the fact that they have some traditional pub food but then throw in some unexpected twists. They even had some Vietnamese items on there. Apparently they just lost their chef so they may be reworking the menu soon, though. And it sounds like their beers change all the time. Next time we are in this neck of the woods we will definitely be back.",

I order a flight of beer to start. ($12 for 6 flights with a surprising $4 upcharge ) anyway I thought I was there for the beer but OMG THE FOOD WAS AMAZING! We got the side Mac n cheese, the Lumpia, and the BBQ Pork Sliders. The pork sliders were AMAZING too bad it was 3 little guys for $11 but who am I kidding I'll get them again. Everything was delicious for a \"splurge\" night for my boyfriend and I. We will be returning. My favorite beer was the belay double IPA. I highly recommend it :)",

    "text": "Beers were decent but not memorable. Had the spoiled dove dirty blonde ale and the hefamerica- they were light and crisp which you want on a hot summer day. However, it had the general light beer flavor you can find anywhere, nothing special.  I ordered the north mountain burger medium, it was over cooked and had more bread then burger. The flavor was satisfying and fixed my burger craving. My bf got the crab dip that is advertised to have 'lumps' of crab meat- there was no crab meat and it took forever for him to get his requested sourdough bread for it. The server can back to deliver other items four different times and had to be reminded twice about the sourdough bread. Overall our server seemed to care more about his other tables and barely came over; was hoping to try another beer but gave up because he took so long.  So overall the brewery was okay, service lacking, might go back eventually.",

Plenty of seats at the bar and a large, open room with several tables. I would recommend a flight of 6 or 8 because they have so a large selection. I started with a stout and it was excellent. It was the winner of the first annual Brewer's Ball put on by Badwater Brewing this year. Second, I have a dirty blonde - which was also excellent. While there I was able to sample a few other beers and I would have been happy with any of them. Additionally, I ordered the fish and chips - three nice short and fat pieces of fish, thin french fries and very good. Plus the staff was incredibly friendly and I enjoyed talking with them. Definitely check out this place if you are on that side of town.",

It will come to me later but for now, I'm Beerly Coherent.  Snacked on the crab dip. This is a decent amount of crab with Ritz crackers. Even tho I dig the old school Ritz, I would prefer a flat, kinda flacky cracker, even saltines. Get a second cracker in the cupboard, Chef Justin. I ran out of crackers so I ordered the German pretzel bread imported and spread the remainder of my lump crab on the bread. The salt over powered the delicate crab a bit but still I was happy, BTW the bread and the three house sauces were damn good.  Next beer name request: \"The Sloper\"",

Nice littel brewery, with a little asian/filipino theme for food selections. Lumpia .... yumm,,,  ok, Staff were very nice and tentative, I sampled the Octomalt  not too bad a little dry tasting, but decent.. Then I had the Spiral Man a dark oatmeal stout,, yumm, very smooth, could definitly drink a few of these, then close off the drinks, i tried the Baby Belgian, aslo very well flavored nice and mellow..   Food: Asian Sliders, great flavor, and the fried onion strings added a good taste, but the dinner roll /bun as a little on the small / soggy quick side, I am not a huge fan of the pretzel buns since \"everyone\" uses em now, but over all Was very good..   I would drive a little out of my way to hit this place up.. Friday afternoon lunch.,not over crowded, tables are spaced out so not bumping into people,, Great job guys ,, mabuhay !!",

Fish and chips are good as well as Poutine.  Burgers are tasty as well as the steak sandwich.  My husband likes the Shepherd's Pie.  Really I have never had any bad food here.  It's not fine dining but great casual dining that pairs well with the beer.  Their beer menu changes and they are great about giving you a shot glass sample before you choose.  Love the CardinAle -- my go to - while my husband gravitates to either the Pict or the Octomalt.  This is just a family owned casual low-key place.  If you are looking for trendy or creativity this is not your place.  For me it is just right and the reason why we keep coming back!",

It was great to see mature performers singing a wide variety of music. This is a difficult place to feel comfortable as a solo introvert, however. Most of the tables are huge and the bar is often crowded. The prices are also higher than average for good, but average food. For example, I ordered 2sides at $7 each; Brussels sprouts and Cauliflower. They were tasty, but the portions were approximately a $2-$3 value. I ate both, left, and purchased pizza elsewhere. I was also disappointed that they were not brewing Porter this week, so I ordered their Stout and took home a growler.",

I am sure glad to see all of the new breweries popping up in the valley. North Mountain doesn't disappoint.  I started with a set of 8 tasters ranging from very light blond to hefe to hazy to amber to brown to dark and I must say, they were nearly all excellent. I am not a beer snob nor do I discriminate between styles. I like them all when they are quality and represent what they are aiming to. The beer I tasted here was quality and clearly was successfully at showing the particular type. With that being said, my family had other styles and they all reported that they very much enjoyed their brews.  I was impressed by the food. Over the years I ya e seen brewery fair generally decrease in quality. People think that just because it is a brewery that their food will be great. We all know that the craft brew craze has hit hard and certain brew houses and simply trying to cash in on the wave of conformity. Not here my friends. The food was fantastic in my opinion. I split some loaded Mac and some very nice salad with my life. The kids had fried stuff and my other crew members all reported approval.  I don't often give 5 stars. It's usually because the particular place doesn't fulfill what it could be for what it's trying to be. North Mountain does it for sure. They nailed exactly what I like in a local brewer. Live music too. Keep it up NMB",

If you're unsure which to order, get a flight! The food is pretty good but eclectic. My hubs always orders some sort of burger while I tend to switch it out between a black bean burger, a salad, or this time a veggie rice dish. There are Asian items, lots of Mac n cheese options, pizza, and burgers. The servers are always friendly and helpful. If you're planning to be out for a while or bringing kids along, they have soooo many board games all around the perimeter of the dining room. Side note: if you're looking for a really fun event in the fall, check out the North Mountain Blues, Brews, and Art Festival. They have it every year and it's worth the $10 advance ticket or $15 at the door!",

I love IPA's and so if you're a beer lover, you gotta check this place out!  Awesome place to grab a quick bite on your lunch break, have a beer after work at happy hour or come by on the weekend to hang out with friends. I'm really happy I found this place and I'll definitely be coming back :)",

The menus looks so good I had a hard time figuring out what to order but when you have POUTINE on the menu I will always go to that. The sangria was so delicious and simple. They are a brewery so they have lots of beer to try but I am sadly not a beer fan, but they do have wine and champagne and of course sangria. The good we tried was really good. Go try this place out!  Brunch is on Sunday from 11-2 and it's worth going for there breakfast corn dogs, which is waffle battered sausage!! So yummy",

I got the wine flight (I believe the wan honey was my favorite) and they also had a good amount in each glass.  Wings and pizza were good! The pizzas crust had a wheat-y taste to it but it was so good.   Prices are extremely fair so it's worth checking out!",

We also had a starter of pretzels which were excellent with a trio of cheese, mustard and honey butter as a compliment. I highly recommend this from a food perspective and the flights of beers all looked really good. The dessert was good - a root beer float and spelt oatmeal cookie with ice cream.",

    "text": "Last night was my first visit to North Mountain Brewery in phoenix. It was well worth a trip from the west valley. I usually try my best to seek out craft breweries, but most times I will settle for a descent pub here and there. Ok, first thing is first, the parking lot is located in the BACK of the brewery. I saw the front patio from Dunlap, but still had to search for the parking lot lol.   The atmosphere first walking in was a neighborhood bar type of mood, so that's always really welcoming. Pretty good size bar with all the brews right there on tap, and behind the bar is the brewery for you too easily see and watch some new brews being created. I had two pints and chowed down on something on the menu called the loaded macaroni and cheese. The first beer was the PT42 Red Ale, I thought it tasted great. Beer number two was the Hoy!, I.P.A., always and I.P.A. everybody, if you are going to head to any brewery you gotta at least try their I.P.A. It is freakin' awesome!!! Really good and hoppy, which means full of flavor to the very last gulp.  Ok my areas I of concern was first the easy to miss parking lot, and maybe an open for business could help a little too. The door to the bar had it's hours printed on a sheet of paper and scotch taped to the window. If you choose to sit at the bar be prepared for ALOT of kitchen noise, space is somewhat limited so you will hear and see every single kitchen noise and food creation because there is no wall dividing the two. Still it's a loacl brew so gotta give credit where credit is due.",

    "text": "This is waaaay out of the way compared to all the other cool Central Phoenix hotspots, but well worth it. Having finally decided to visit what is comparatively middle-of-nowhere, I have no regrets! Upon entering, the lavish Christmas decorations caught me off guard, and it was so fancy I thought I might be a bit too casual.   I took a few steps forward, and realized this place is casual...and rad! With the benches in the dining area, the stacks of crates in an open kitchen, and the unpolished, paper menus, this place was reminiscent of a high school cafeteria. That is, If my high school served beer.   The brews were clearly unique. Brown IPA? Strong, bitter blonde ale? In the age of craft beer that tries to make a name for itself, North Mountain is attempting to corner each and every niche ignored by big names like San Tan and Four Peaks. Will it work? Only time will tell.   The menu is pretty eclectic, but I tried a miniature pizza because I'm not as adventurous with food as I am with alcohol. Did not disappoint. All of my beers kicked my ass, especially the Belgian Trippel, which save for a haunting, slightly sour note, tasted very authentic (Trust me, I've been to Belgium).   So in the end, North Mountain seeks to do everything that no one else will, and for very good prices. Service was excellent, and it was a pleasure meeting the owner as well as his niece who served us. I wish nothing but success for this up-and-coming business. If they can start looking as professional as other breweries, and offer more than a handful of beers at a time, they'll totally get my elusive fifth star!",

They use blue cheese on the sandwich which tasted really good.  The 2nd time I had the Poutine which is a very unique dish.  I guess it is a Canadian dish but I never had it before.  It was really good and it only cost $12.  It is french fries topped with short rib, cheese curds, and gravy.  It is a really hearty dish and you get a lot for the money.  I really think they could charge a lot more for this dish.  The short ribs melt in your mouth!  They had some live acoustic music on Friday which was nice and they played some good classic rock songs.  This won't be the last time I go here, I really like this place.  09/24/15 the Poutine portion was smaller then the last time I had it, about half the amount of short rib.",

The wings were good (house hot sauce wasn't very hot), but the poutine... well... the poutine was sinfully delicious.  Salty, savory, and cheesy.  Oh man, it feels so good to be so bad.  For beer, we ordered the ALTerior Motive, IPAcious, and the Baby Belgian.  Great quality brews with well rounded flavors and some unique flavor profiles.    Service was friendly and timed very well.

The side of roasted cauliflower came in a small bowl and was probably a total of 6 medium florets. For seven dollars....  the roasted brussel sprouts were a little more jazzed up but still small.

My feeling is they should scale the menu down too the items that they do best. The crab dip that we ordered tonight had very little crab in it and had pita strips that barely were able to pick up the dip. They did eventually bring bigger, wider strips, but our feeing was that it should have been part of their QC process.   I then ordered the shepherds pie. It wasn't cold, but it wasn't exactly warm either. I could have made this in my own kitchen. Any colder and I would have sent it back, but I had waited nearly a half an hour for t and was hungry.   Erica was our waitress and helped us anyway that she could. Unfortunately, this place is not the total package. While the beers are spot on, the food not so much. North Mountain Brewing Co. would have been better off opening just a tap room, rather than  full scale brew pub.   The Red is smooth, the blonde is great, but it eventually needs to lead to somewhere and it didn't for me tonight.",

It was all we could do to sit patiently while our table was set up.  Unfortunately that is where the visit turned for the worse. Our server seemed like a nice guy but just couldn't get it together. We ordered some beers and it took well over 10 minutes for him to bring our beers and come back for our order. We asked for some recommendations and took him up on the suggestions. He suggested the Justin brussel sprout salad and stated it was his absolute favorite thing on the menu. So I ordered it and it was mediocre at best. My husband ordered the \"pho\" which he stated was great...it was literally ramen straight out the package with an egg and a couple veggies. My son ordered the kid's burger. It was like a burnt meatball on a dry bun with no toppings whatsoever. My friend ordered the kale salad which she picked at then turned her nose up at. My other friend ordered the fish and chips but would have been better off \"trusting the Gordon's fisherman\".   All the poor food aside, the server then left us alone without checking on us throughout our meal. When we finished we asked the guy bussing our table to send him back over so we could order another beer. Our server took our order then hung out with the other servers at the bar/register area for 15 minutes. Eventually we decided to ditch this place to find another that would actually bring us our beers. So I walked up to the register and asked him for our checks and told him to make sure he didnt charge us for the beers he never brought us. He brought us our checks a couple minutes later and mumbled \"sorry about that\"....   We won't be back.  Edited 04/30/13 at 20:10: To address owner Candy's response below. I am not surprised to see that your professionalism suits your establishment. My review was as honest as I could possibly state it. Your \"pho\" sucked and it was definitely ramen. I cannot tell you how the kale salad tasted because I did not try it, just stating what I observed of it. As for the back-handed insult stating \"I am a mother of 3 kids- if I see a burnt meetball (sic) I would certainly not feed to my children- but I am so surprised you let your son eat it.\" At no point did I state I allowed my kid to eat it. In fact we stopped after we left your restaurant to get him a different dinner. All the food aside, we most likely would have overlooked the crappy food if the service was better and I would have provided more stars here. I am not sure what you intend by inviting me to \"call you to contact me with your honesty\". Do you want me to call you at this restaurant? You can email me directly with the best contact info if that is your intention.",

    "text": "Wow, there's quite a few reviews here that are highly critical of a place that's barely been open for two months! Heck, when I started my new job, I didn't know what I was doing for at least 3 months... Anyway, let's give some credit to the folks who decided to open a microbrew / gastropub down in the Slope during this sh*t recession! That being said, we rolled in on a Thursday night on a friend's recommendation and they earned two new customers. I had the beer flight to sample the menu, and LOVED three of them, liked three of them, and was appreciative of the other two. The crab dip was made with actual crab - not the Krab, cream cheese and mayo that my Midwestern friends seem to think is the gold standard. It's a must-have. Any eatery that has the moral turpitude to support and serve local AZ farmers and butchers' products get a tip of the cap from me. We had the sausage plate, and although I can probably get the sausages from a variety of places, the cooking and presentation was spot on. That, and the mashed potatoes rivaled that of me dear old mum's in terms of pure deliciousness. I want to go back on a packed Friday or Saturday to see if we get the same level of service (fantastic, by the way,) and to sample the rest of the menu.  The point is, Yelpers, you screwed me by not supporting my favorite local Thai place (Sa Bai Dee) and they went under. Don't break my heart again by flaming this place before they even have a chance to sort out the kinks. Keep going, bring your friends, and support your neighbors that had the gusto to open a proper gastropub. Yes, good help is hard to find; yes, they need to find their voice when it comes to the beer menu, and YES we need to team up and help a beer loving locavore put a checkmark in the \"win\" column.",

I am a fan of local craft beer, and this place ranks right up there with the best.  As with any small brewer, the selection can depend on what they have recently made.  Had the amber and the stout, and both were excellent.  The food is typically pub food, and is very good (the kids liked the pretzels so much, we had to order more), but had some interesting twists (the poutine, for example, which was very good).  And the service was very good.  Our waiter was busy with other tables, but was attentive to our needs.    Overall, glad this place is around, and suggest to anyone that like local brew pubs to venture over there.",

The beer was VERY good (and the ONLY reason this is 3 stars) but the food was worse! Burger came back WAY over cooked and the size of a sausage patty at $14??? Told the waitress about it and she seemed to be oblivious that I wasn't happy and never brought me another burger, so the manager took care of me. Won't be going for the food, and the service was a joke. Stinks, really good beer, so maybe I will go back, but just for the beer. : P",

It was a newly tapped keg of Hefe and it came out looking like mud. Mouth feel was course and grainy. Flavor was off too from all the trub still free floating around. They were friendly and understood and took it off our bill. If this were my brew pub that beer would have never left the bar and ended up in the drain.  I like that they serve their beer in the correct glass style for each beer style. You don't get that much any more because places are lazy and only serve in pints or mugs. YES IT REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE. But if Coors Light is your favorite beer you probably won't understand.  I would return without hesitation.",

Beers are awesome and keep coming out of the brewery with all the freshness and unique flavor anyone can ask for from local microbrews.  We have been back three times and each visit gets better and better.  This Microbrewery is on track to really make a name for itself in the Phoenix culinary arena.  Not pretentious or fake. Real solid brews and a menu to be proud of.  Kudos to everyone at NMB!",

A nice selection of beers that include not only their own kettle creations but well thought out Local (Guest) tap offerings.  For my kindred spirits that enjoy a little bread to go with their beer I must recommend the pretzel, they where fantastic with the ESB. We also tried the wings and I will tell you they are not from Buffalo. They are marinated, grilled, tender and the most refreshing flavor I have sampled on chicken in a long time.",

The beer was off-the-hook fantastic.  This is a family operation so it will be exciting to watch it grow.

The brown had a good malty tone with some coffee flavor either added or from the toasted malts. The serendipitous Belgian dark was fun, nice and sweet with a good Belgian yeast flavor.

I've been coming here on and off for many months, sometimes just for one of their beers, but sometimes like today to grab a bite to eat. They make a surprisingly good flatbread pizza, simple but tasty.  Of the staff, only one I've interacted with much is Anthony, and he's extremely competent and very knowledgeable. Today I'm having the barbarian all-meat pizza, I've had it before, and Anthony suggested to spice it up with some locally grown Fresno peppers.  They have live music on some sort of regular basis, tonight it's a 3-piece playing old Eagles and other 70's stuff. Not exactly my thing, but it's a differentiator. It's convenient, located at next to the five or six points intersection of Dunlap, Cave Creek, 7th, and I think two or three other little streets.  Right now there's 12 of their own beers on tap, and each one of them is notable in one wY or another. I'm pretty sure I've tried them all. In the past few months, it seems they've had a kindling of interest in hops, and have made some very nice beers.  Finally, my wife likes the place and the food, she doesn't care for beer. But they have a decent selection of wine and that works for her. I recommend this place for good beer and tasty food.",

We had the pistoune (spelling?) which is made of some really great cooked short ribs, and fries.  Very delicious, and the meat was good quality which the bartender said they smoke for 16 hours.  The tenderness of the meat shows it was cooked a long time as it just melts in your mouth. Love the homemade beer here, but I don't like super strong beers so my friend got the Pilsner and I got the Creme--and both of us loved what we got.  If I reordered I'd get the Pilsner next time as it was just a smidge better tasting, but both were wonderful. Love this clean, little place!  Nice bartender who was really helpful, and even brought our food to the table near the stage.   Would love to come back here, for sure.

I tried the peach beer on draft, it was yummy.  Service was great, Amber was never far and made she we were good often.",

For the entrees we tried the shepherds lamb pie, and the popper burger all paired with themany different beers they have there. For dessert we had the frybread squares with dark chocolate dip wow!

    "text": "Met up with some fellow friends for a Hike and Brew, I sadly did not make the hike but was able to join in for the brew, the place picked was North Mountain Brewing Co.   We were a pretty big group, maybe 15 to 20, and we had 2 servers one on each side of the table and they were pretty good at making sure we had what we needed. The kitchen area is opened and I could see that there were 2 guys working it. The vibe of the place is great, opened ceiling, wooden tables, and opened kitchen, rustic and industrial. I enjoyed it.  I 1st ordered a 7 flight of beer, thought it would be the best way to figure out what I like and don't like, I can say I enjoyed PT 42, the oatmeal stout, hefe & esb and my favorite was creem .  After checking out the menu I went with the North Mtn Burger, but I had already seen a burger come out and saw that the fries are shoe string fries (those are not real fries)  so I asked if I could replace the fires with something else and that's what I did.  The burger was a Kobe beef style, had butter lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, white cheddar cheese, mustard and spicy aioli sauce. Over all the burger was good, I was a craving a beefy cheeseburger, but sadly this was not it, the cheese had been charbroiled onto the burger could only tell cheese was there by the crispy burnt corners of it. The spicy aioli sauce was great and went well with everything.    Instead of the fries I got a side of their brussel sprouts, they were roasted brussel sprouts with fresno peppers, red onions and cotijia cheese. I really enjoyed these, the peppers were fresh and had a spicy little touch to them, it went perfect with the roasted flavor of the brussel sprouts enjoyed this dish much more than I would have with the shoe string fries.   It was a good time with friends and exploring the many flavors of beer!",

It's always really busy, loud and the food is nothing really to brag about. After reading all the reviews looks like they have serious issues with customer service, even if the waiters and waitress' are good it's the first impression of the hostess that sets the precedent to decide whether or not patrons will return.",

The peanut sauce is all you need, though.  Also tried the pretzel bread.  Hot and tasty with the right amount of chewiness.  A honey cinnamon butter, cheese sauce and spiced mustard came for dipping the pretzels.  Had the CardinAle Red, which was very smooth and flavorful.  Entrees were good, too.  But, seriously, go for the lumpia!",

They have great bartenders who actually know the products they serve. You would think that is normal, but, trust me, it's NOT! This team knows their beers and actually act interested in knowing you are enjoying your drink. The servers are friendly and full of great suggestions for drinks and food. Food...yum! We love all the new and interesting specials and many standards on the menu. The one negative I do have isn't enough to dock a star, but is worth mentioning. Portion size and preparation seems to depend on the chef of the day. For example, we have been served their delicious REAL shepherd's pie in no less than 3 different sizes, all for the same price, all at dinner time. Hmmmmm. But, their burgers are high quality, cooked to order. Their salads are amazing, especially the brussels sprout one. Their pizzas are so good too. Can't go wrong! You will love your experience at North Mountain!",

They have a small patio and a small private dining room.  I ordered the sangria, hubs ordered the C.R.E.E.M., 1 male flight, 1 female flight and 3 sodas. Alcoholic beverages here get a A+. I love the sangria. It's tart, fruity and sweet.  Food. One very plain burger, 1 cheese only flatbread, 1 grilled cheese with bacon for the kids. One fish and chips, 1 crispy chicken sandwich, 1 shepherd's pie, 1 burger for the adults.  Food took a really long time which would have been ok but they brought ours plates out 1 at a time so it took about 10 minutes from 1st plate to last on our table.  My husbands burger when he took the top bun off looked liked someone had taken a huge bite out of it. He showed the waitress and the manager came over with new one with an apology. My fish was outstanding. The fish was so mild if you didn't get a bite of crispy coating it was just texture in your mouth. Excellent. The chicken sand was huge but looked like shake and bake but cooked nicely, dinig companion ate most of it. Shepherds pie dish was licked clean. All kids cleaned their plates.  Overall No. Mt. is an excellent dining choice. The service always stellar, food always tasty and it's great to meet friends or bring my family.",

I really enjoyed drinking many types of beer there.  Also their foods were appropriate saltiness so really good. But I would like to recommend this restaurant to add flight glasses because of their limitations to serve flights to many customers. At least my friends and I were waiting for next serve repeatedly.",

    "text": "Atmosphere: A-  I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into North Mountain Brewing Company. When I say pleasantly surprised, I don't mean it in a bad way at all - it's just that the surrounding area could be seen by some as being a bit rough. North Mountain felt very homey to me right away - they were blasting reggae (which is the way to my heart), they had two long communal tables, lighting was nice, and they also had just enough Christmas decorations to feel festive. I loved it. They do a great job of making themselves seem like an oasis in the area they are in. Even though my stop there was relatively quick, it's a place I can see myself just hanging at for hours at a time.  Cleanliness: A  A very clean place. Always a good feeling to have. Sometimes it can be tough for an establishment to feel homey and clean at the same time, but North Mountain did it.  Service: B+  Service was great. When we walked in, a bartender immediately noticed and greeted us, informing myself and my fiance that we could take a seat anywhere and a server would find us. I can't recall our server's name, but she was very attentive and got the timing down very well on when we needed checking up on. My only complaint (if that) on service was when I asked what her favorite beers were on the menu, she simply pointed out two that were the most popular. Most of the time when I ask a server or bartender for a recommendation, I expect a somewhat passionate response as to what they personally enjoy eating/drinking. I didn't get that here.  Food: B-  A first glance the menu seemed to be a bit boring. After a closer look, I did notice they offer a few good spins to traditional bar/brewery food which is nice. We ordered the chicken sandwich and a side of mac 'n cheese. Chicken sandwich came with bacon jam on it which was a nice touch, and the chicken itself was breaded and fried into a perfect crisp. I personally wasn't a fan of the mac 'n cheese - I thought the cheese sauce was too grainy, and it just seemed so orange it looked fake. On the other hand, my fiance loved the mac 'n cheese, so what do I know?  Beer: C  Unfortunately, this is where things go a bit down hill.We ordered a taster of 8 different beers so we could get a good feel for all they had to offer (or at least almost all of it). They were good size tasters, so it was actually a perfect amount to split between two people. I think for the size of them, the price point was good.  It wasn't too expensive. The CardinALE Red was my favorite. It was a well-balanced beer that was super drinkable. My least favorites were the bourbon-barrel aged pumpkin beer, and also the imperial stout. The pumpkin beer had WAY too much bourbon flavor. Part of me can't believe I just typed that (as I'm a huge whiskey fan), but it just didn't fit in this beer. It was very overpowering. Overall, the beers here just didn't stand out to me much  Creativity: C  Between the beer and the food, I felt that the creativity was a bit lacking compared to other breweries. I loved the service and the overall vibe of the place, but again - feel like they could improve with execution on some beers and some creativity on the menu.",

The food I have eaten is here:  the pouting fries very small portion for $14, the southwest burger was ok I think it was to flavorless but the thin fries were delish, the nachos not enough of cheese and a oatmeal cookie was delicious except that it was more ice cream than cookie but if they can balance the  cookie  and the ice cream that will be great.  What is great is the beer specially the purplessoures!!!  That's the reason I came back.",

I actually drank the entire thing which is RARE for me.  (I usually drink about half.  Doesn't matter the size - I just want half.)    The food was delicious.  The burger special abomination was a burger topped with an onion ring, mac n' cheese, short ribs and unicorn sprinkles - happy tummies at the table.  My poutine was delicious - my only complaint about it (and this super picky) is that the curds were melted.  But, that is a small price to pay for rich gravy and potato-y goodness.    Desserts are another category entirely.  The grain cookie is just stupid.  The husband makes beer and has made some wonderful dense dark breads out of spent grain.  I didn't think a cookie was possible but it is - it's reminiscent of an oatmeal cookie and topped with ice cream and served WARM... you're welcome.  We also got the malt which was tasty but I'd choose the cookie again in a heartbeat.    This joint isn't even remotely in our neighborhood but we'll be comin' back.",

So forgive me and I will try to do my best to tell you everything I have tried if not the whole menu. ^_^  From most favorite to least I will make a list of everything starting with Favorite first and with a short description on why I like it. -Poutine: So full of cheesy goodness and meat and fries?!  such an amazing combo and the cheese is melted so perfectly it makes me drool thinking about it. -Mussels:I was a bit hesitant when my boyfriend ordered this because the mussels I am used to looking at are much bigger in size.  These were little guys that reminded me of clams but in a butter sauce and with a side of sliced toasted bread which is delicious. Ahi-I love raw fish more than a lot of things, if I could eat sashimi every day I think id be in heaven. But this was much different, more of like a poki ahi salad stacked nicely with a great tasting sauce. Crab Dip-amazing as well, I love cheese and dips together. So delicious. Just try it! -Deep fried banana split- no need for a description its just good! -piece of cake- also good no comment needed! -Spent Grain cookie- different not my favorite but good also -Grilled sausage platter- too much potatoes for my personal taste but the sausages with the potatoes were good together. -North mountain malt-was like a shake, pretty good! -Pizza- this one was kind of our fault,  my boyfriend and I like to watch diners drive ins and dives and shows similar.  We watched andrew zimmern in MN add a over easy egg to a pizza when it was almost done cooking so it could ooze over the pizza.  Sounds delicious.  No one out here understands how to do that here at all when we try to explain it.  So what we got was like a breakfast scrambled egg pizza with lettuce on it since we ordered the Cesar. Gross.",

They had 4 of their own beers plus one guest tap. Their beers were nothing special. The pale ale, Patrick star and ipa were all very similar. The stout seems more like a porter in my opinion (I love both styles so I did enjoy it).  The menu is a miss match of a worldly items and doesn't have any real flow to it. The food was fresh and well presented. The fries that come with the fish and chips are different fries that come with the poutine and were both disappointing. The fish was great as well as the small portion of short ribs on the poutine.  Everyone I was with complained about the portion for the price. But fresh ingredients are more expensive than a bunch of frozen crap. So I didn't mind the prices, I actually thought they weren't bad.   The cons: Service. The service was horrible. Since we were nearly the only ones there we got our food quickly and our first round of beers came out quickly, although my wife was never asked what she wanted to drink so she never got anything. We were never offered another round of drinks, only dessert. Our server never came back to check on us either and we didn't see her for some time. When we left there was a group of about 6 or 7 employees all smoking in the back parking lot at their smoking area. Guess smoking is a higher priority than a paying customer.",

    "text": "This is more of a 3.5 for me at this point, but could bump it up in the future. I've been coming here on Tuesday nights which is open mic night. The service is friendly and there are a surprising number of people there for a Tuesday night. Kind of an older crowd. Most of the bands play classic rock, which I can get into. So the open mic night is fun and adds to the atmosphere so that is more of the 4-star-I'm-a-fan category, and I'd like to see what the place is like on the weekend too, so I'll be back. And it's a unique bar and hangout for the neighborhood so it gets points there.  The beer and food is more in the 3-star-A-OK category. I've tried a few different beers and all were pretty good but nothing to write home about. Their beers can't compete with the other more established local breweries like Four Peaks or San Tan, at least not yet. North Mountain seems to rotate out their beers so I could see them eventually brewing up a beer that become their signature just like Kiltlifter is for Four Peaks.   I only got food this last time I was there. I had a grilled chicken sandwich. As my friends even pointed out, the chicken breast on my sandwich was quite small. The chipotle mayo didn't have much of a kick, and I could have done without the bacon jam. I had overlooked the jam when I ordered the sandwich so next time I'll know to ask them to hold that, but I don't really get that condiment when you already have chipotle mayo. And if you want bacon, then you can just order actual bacon and not bacon in jam form, amirght? All that aside it really wasn't a bad grilled chix, and I will add that my friend liked her french onion soup very much.",

    "text": "Let me first say that I REALLY want this place to work. I sincerely hope I am able to give a higher rating next time I go back.  First, how in the world does a brewery run out of beer???? This should NEVER happen. The only beers they had available were IPA and Stout, neither of which I like. I realize they are new, but this is like Denny's running out of eggs. When the waitress, Amy (who was very sweet, might I add), realized we were very disappointed that they were out of the Hefe and Pale Ale (amongst others), I think she could have sent the manager/owner over to buy a round - or to simply apologize. I realize they are new, but there is NO way they are going to survive if they run out of beer.  My husband ordered the short ribs which he really liked.  I had the vegetarian because I love eggplant although I am not a vegetarian. The flavor was really good, but it needed more veggies - peppers, mushrooms, onions. It was a chopped up eggplant sandwich with arugula and sauce. The end.  The one-man band was great, and the openness of the space was fantastic. The big downfall of the decor are the BRIGHT lights. They are blinding, so don't look directly into them.   Like I said, I really hope I am able to give this place a five star next time I go. I live right down the street so would love a local brewery to bike to! PLEASE, make enough beer for your patrons. After all, you are calling yourself a \"brewery\". In my opinion, you are not this with three beers to choose from!!",

But what's really nice is that they have tasty food and friendly service. The crab dip made from mascarpone cheese is everything. I haven't had anything on the menu that I did not like. I enjoy the open modern atmosphere. The only thing that I would note is that it tends to get loud, when there's a lot of people. You can always escape to the mini patio if that bothers you. Overall, great place in a location close to home.",

First and foremost was the beer selection:  they only had 2 of they're own beers, a Hefeweizen and ESP (both pretty good) and they only had 1 hoppy guest beer.  I'd describe the food menu as bizarre, there are more oyster choices than main dishes or appetizers and the main dishes included things like Poutine and Banger.  My suggestion is to check out their website before you decide to go.  You'll notice something else bizarre - that there's no mention of beer on it.  And you can see for yourself the odd food choices.  One last tip - the lunch menu is much smaller than what's listed on-line.",

    "text": "I sadly give North Mountain a less than enthusiastic review because I had such high expectations.  Unfortunately, while the beer was fairly good, the service needed some serious attention.    We went the day after the grand opening and waited ten minutes for them to figure out where they were going to seat us when they had more than half of their tables available.  Then, it took another fifteen minutes for us to get a server who would take our drink and appetizer order.  By the time we finally got our beers and pretzels, we were so discouraged that we opted to go have dinner elsewhere.    Also, this place isn't nearly as kid friendly as most of the other breweries in town--it's mostly an eclectic adult menu--or if they have a kids menu, nobody told us about it. I would definitely give them another shot, but they need to figure out how to serve their patrons in a more organized fashion.",

    "text": "So we also went to the soft-opening.  In that, I'm patient with the service issues which were more than present.  Our 4 dinners were brought out one at a time, about 5-10 minutes apart.  I watched as server after server wandered around the room asking \"did you order...?\"  My biggest issues here were definitely the problems I don't see them resolving with some simple management.  1. I like beer.  I like craft brews and love microbreweries because you can get something completely new.  Not here. I tried every beer they had on tap, except the one they said wasn't ready yet.  The pale ale was decent, but murky and boring. The hefe had a strong vinegar smell, but luckily tasted a little bit better with a strong banana residual flavor.  The James Brown nut ale had the most character, but at the end of the night, was just a nut brown.  The ESB was boring...little flavor and too dark for the style.  Overall, I enjoyed the guest taps much more.  The Great Divide saison and the Four Peaks black IPA were much more interesting and worth calling craft beers.   2. The food. What a disaster.  I sat with a group of 4.  We ordered their pretzel bread, which I think is just rye bread with pretzel salt on it.  It didn't have much flavor.  The three dips it came with were decent though. I don't eat seafood so the choices for dinner were limited.  There was chicken, burger, bangers and mash, or shepherd's pie.  We ultimately ordered three of these.  Which all came out about 5-10 minutes apart.  The chicken was a drumstick and thigh on about 3/4 cup rice.  VERY salty and mostly just a teriyaki taste. The bangers and mash are one sausage on lumpy mashed potatoes. The shepherd's pie was good, all six bites of it. The burger was forgotten about and reordered.  It came out rare, not medium-well as ordered.  It was ok, but I've had much better burgers that didn't cost $14.  Overall, I would eat before you go, and be willing to know that any beer you get here you can get pretty much anywhere else.  Until they get more creative with beers, and reasonable with thier food prices/portions we will not be going again.    What a shame.",

Just like any new neighbor having guests over for the first time, your job as a guest is to welcome them first... Hold back on your criticism as if they owe you something because they we're blessed by your company. First impressions? Yes, the 4$ valet is not in line with the neighborhood norms. Adjust. Yea, live music! Live music by the front door?! Maybe not... Also, put up some artwork or other stuff to breakup the bare wall space. Ok... That's it. Nothing else to crab about cuz I was here two days in a row and I'm ready to go back tonight. The food was GREAT. Good portions, better than I make at home, and less than it would cost to make/burn myself. Great beers too! The one I disliked most is still delicious! How often can you say that?! Plus, I enjoy that it's not \"service\" so much as a bunch of people who like to cook and serve food and beer, hanging out with their neighbors. Like contributing to a pot luck with cash instead of potato salad. Don't get lost in the expectations of what you are buying with your dollar. Come, sit, eat, drink, listen, meet, share, taste, smell, speak, thank and ENJOY your neighbors and your neighborhood! ;) You can thank me later... Cheers!",

The atmosphere was cool... though I was blinded by the bright lighting inside the restaurant, which for me, is offputting.  We opted to sit outside, which was nice.    The female server, mid thirtys, very nice, tattoos i think, was a sweetheart... However she didnt mention what they were out of, until after our drink orders were delivered...  THEY WERE OUT OF THE BURGER! the only sandwich on the menu... I opted to try the pretzels, and the chicken wings.  My friend got the shepherds pie and the poutine.  We gave the POUTINE  5 stars! great dish! pretzel bites - 4 Stars - tasty sauces CHICK WINGS 4 STARS... - very spicy, a tad over cooked, Shephards pie - 3 stars..  not bad. Beer - very tasty 5 Stars...  I love oysters, but I don't think of them as going with beer, maybe thats just me... I usually would want a martini or a glass of champagne.

Met him tonight and he seems like family already. We had the Oxtail lumpia (the meat tender and with a perfectly crisp wrap,) Ahi Tuna dish that will rock your pallet, also had the risotto with chicken and finished the meal with  my first ever WORT milkshake. Talk about malty goodness. Presentation of all items were perfect! Hello.. 1 star reviews - it was the opening of a brewery/restaurant , of course it's going to be crowded. And for the record, this is a large place with ample parking. Far better than some of the other fine establishments mentioned. The kitchen staff was in concert with each other like a perfect sonnet when we arrived. They were happy, pleasant and responsive. No doubt due to the leadership of their Chef.  Beer was outstanding, weakest in MHO was the Pale, but still a solid beer. The ESB and Hefeweizen were spot on. This is very rare for first batches from any new brewery. I did not have the fries, but will check them out TOMORROW! My only criticism was lighting might be a little bright, but not distracting. And if that's the only suggestion this very detailed project manager has, this place should get 6 stars whether it was opening night or 6 months from now. And...personally if wrote an email, BASHING or congratulating a new establishment on opening week, I would not expect an email within 24 HOURS. Good Grief.",

    "text": "So we went on opening weekend and we had a fairly large party of 8 of us so we knew there were be issues so I am going to try this place again in a month or so and hopefully they've worked out the kinks. There were some really good hits and a couple of really bad misses.  First the good hits. The Brussels sprouts are awesome! While the pretzel bread was good the three sauces that came with it were the bomb! My only complaint was there was not enough of them in the little cups. My wife loved the crab dip and the mussels. The burgers were good but needed bacon. We were told after we had eaten that it could be added but no one mentioned it to us and it wasn't on the menu. The servers were very friendly and apologetic on some of the misses. The beer was good. Not great but not bad. I tried the Hefe and the Pale Ale.  So the misses. And these were pretty big misses.  I was the first person to get my plate and my fries were ice cold. Totally inedible! Between the time I got my plate and the last person on our table got his plate was more than 10 minutes. I was done with my meal completely by the time the last person started digging in. The Mac and Cheese, had no cheese on it at all. It was just bland noodles with what  were supposed to be peas in it but I only saw maybe 2 peas. They should just take this off the menu!!! It was by the far the worst thing we ate!  My other complaint is really kind of my own. The place seems to be a geared towards a seafood menu. Out of our entire party, only two people liked seafood. When I think beer, I think burgers and meat and manly food. When I think seafood I think wine. Maybe that is what the owner is looking to change, but with only just 3 or 4 things on the menu not seafood I think they are doing a disservice.  Overall, there are a dozen other brewhouses in Phoenix that serve fantastic food and fantastic beer. I really hope North Mountain Brewing gets their act together, there is nothing on that side of town and it could use it! I will be back in a month or so to see if they can get things together. I think their hits outweigh their misses so go and enjoy a beer, just don't go with a large party. And stay away from the Mac and Cheese!",

The food was much better. I tried the cheese and meat plate which was very good. The lumpia was ok but the peanut sauce that came with it was to die for. Then I had the brussel sprouts as well as the cauliflower. Let me tell you. I love cauliflower and theirs was pretty good. I have not had brussel sprouts since I was about 8 and didn't much care for them then, but it was the description and the fact that they were on the menu that was intriguing, plus the fact that my server highly suggested them. They were soooooo amazing!!! I'm not even a huge veggie lover but I cannot convey to you how delicious these brussel sprouts were. Get them! I will go all the way back just for those, and probably have the IPA.",

Thank goodness they had a few guest taps, but even then they weren't exactly stellar choices (The Grand Canyon one, yuck).    So I, too, anxiously awaited this place opening but I read the bad reviews of the first few weeks.  I thought it best to give them a month or so to work out any issues.  Well, I'm quite surprised at the beer issue and the rather restricted list of menu items.  One key flaw was that you can't order from a brewpub-appropriate appetizer list in the in-between meal times.  I'm there at 2:30 and my only choices were full portion lunch items.  And not only that, I don't think they're offering enough non-seafood items either.  A lot of people just don't like seafood, and a brewery/brewpub is going to draw a very general crowd of hungry patrons (unlike seafood restaurants per se where it is understood in advance they'll probably just have seafood options).  Parking was very challenging in the back and it's not exactly a nice part of town.  Service was polite.  Food I did receive was fine, but nothing great.  Prices reasonable.  Last and most important though I didn't think their house beers were very good.  But I'm withholding some judgment on this because I was unable to try most of them.",

    "text": "Being medically required to ride the wagon currently, I was there for the food - and it was worth the trip.   First off, they have lumpia, which I've mot found elsewhere in the Valley. When I lived in the SF Bay Area, my next-door neighbor for several years was the local 'queen' of the Pilipina community, and these were her specialty for every street festival, fair, and celebration. NMB's are almost as good as hers, which means they are excellent - and the portion is very generous as well. The two sauces that accompany them are both delicious, but I think I like the peanutty one best.   Highlighting an unjustly maligned vegetable, the Brussels Sprout salad is a very tasty presentation of an off-beat dish. Nicely spiced, the tiny leaves have been stir-fried, I think, and are wonderfully accented by the peppers and other accouterments. The dressing was good, but here's a tip - use the leftover lumpia sauce(s), either ot both, for an added taste treat.   My companion thoroughly enjoyed his Grilled Cheese sandwich - he had decided to forego accompanying it with the Tomato Soup, so he was able to help me polish off the lumpia, which he loved. He enjoyed his chosen libation, too - I was trying to ignore it, out of jealousy. The baseball playoffs were on, so he was happy about that, too.  Other family members are practically regulars here, so I'm sure to be back soon - I look forward to a return trip.  (Just one caveat - the servers who smoke need a better understabding of how far they are supposed to be from the entrance.)",

    "text": "Great local craft brewery with surprisingly good food. We came here with a large group to watch a world cup match. Our server bent over backwards to make sure we had a great experience, which we did. Beer was great. Caber Toss Scottish was my favorite. Followed by the C.R.E.E.M ale. Food-wise, the shepherd's pie was delicious. Had the poutine, too, but would opt for the shepherd's pie over that when we come again. Great neighborhood bar.",

On our last visit, we got stuck on the C.R.E.E.M. and the Caber Toss Scottish Dark.  Both are extremely tasty (assuming you like those styles).  The food is definitely above par for a pub.  The lumpia and the brussel sprouts are fantastic!",

I didn't get her name but she had super straight teeth and tattoos? Lol I tried !",

The beer is great, I'd recommend any of their higher ibu or darker beers. If you're a fan of Belgians they have a good option for you. This is one of those restaurants that I could frequent due to the close proximity of my residence.",

We asked the bartender how the place was and he referenced wanting to burn the place down, but that wasn't possible because of the brick. If you want people to come back the staff has to want to be there. I will return at least 1 more time because the beer is good but you may want to talk to the clown behind the bar.",

The piece if cake was AMAZING! We also got to try the malt- again really, really good. Desserts are an afterthought at some restaurants, but not here. Beer was more of a 3.5 stars, but it was satisfying. I would say only downside is no full bar and no other beers besides theirs.",

First time I had poutine was 3 yrs ago when I was in Montreal and it was just as good there as it was here. My only grumble was the grandpa band playing live music there. They were so AWEFUL,if it wasn't for my great beer and poutine I would have left as soon as possible. All in all I don't think I would return during happy hour. A little to noisy for my liking and I could not hear my husband talking to me. I will how ever return to refill my growler of beer as I loved the taste.",

    "text": "My honey and I had the weekends to ourselves, which is a rare occurrence and we decided to check this spot out. I've been wanting to see what it's all about for some time now, so we finally decided to head in. I think we picked the perfect night, there was a live band there by the name of KAB I believe, anyway they were amazing and played awesome music. The food was super delicious, I wasn't expecting a place that specializes in brewing beer to also deliver with awesome food. We had the wings, crab dip, and small pizza. My person had 2 beers and I 2 Sangria. The drinks were great, Sangria can be a difficult thing for some places to pull off, and I even liked the beer, my pallet hasn't reached the \"beer is awesome\" stage yet. Wings were really flavorful, pizza even had some heat, I think they used a rosemary and jalapeno crust, and the crab dip.. well you can't really go wrong with crab dip. It was so good. I also ordered the Brussels sprout salad but our server forgot, and that was a perfect mistake because we were soo full. :)  Another great thing about this place is I saw people from all ages there on Friday Night. The age range was pretty awesome and something you just don't see too much of unless your in some chain restaurant. I saw ages ranging from 5-6 to 60's easy. A lot of young adults ranging 19-26 too. Great Beer, good vibes, awesome music, and delicious food you can't go wrong.",

Have been drinking craft beer for more than 20 years. We live in the Bay Area and have had the chance to try many craft breweries, this is possibility the finest brews I've tried, their C.R.E.E.M. Ale was killer. I must say the brew master is an artist and knows his craft. This place is worth the visit if you enjoy good brew, did not eat but if the beer is an indication of quality I would guess the food is good. A must visit place not far off of the highway if you enjoy BEER.  Note I am not a yelper but just had too on this one, it is must place to visit if your in the area or even a drive just to go.
