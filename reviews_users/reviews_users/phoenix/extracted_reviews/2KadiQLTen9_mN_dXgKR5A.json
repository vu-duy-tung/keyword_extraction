The freshness of the sashimi and the quality of the vegetables in their poke bowls is hands down unbeatable!  The owners (I think) are so enthusiastic that you can tell they are very passionate and proud of their creations.  Each bowl looks artistically crafted with eye-catching colorful, unique, fresh, and crunchy veggies flanking the mouth-watering fish.  I feel over the top about my description but it is truly how I feel about it!  The sad part is the portions are small and my stomach is big.  I added raw scallops to my salmon poke bowl and ended up paying $19 and still hungry.  The glutton I am really needs two bowls.  When I want value, I go for Ahi Poki.  When I want perfection, I'll go to Chula.",

This is by far the best spicy tuna poke I've ever had. Usually poke places will ground/mince it to a mush which can be unappealing for texture. They cut it in thin small strips here. I love the mushroom and shishito peppers they put in there as well. A very well balanced flavorful dish! I will definitely come back!",

After a few trips they will remember your name and face- that's always a welcoming feeling. I'm from California so fresh fish has always been on the dinner plate for me and these guys truly provide that. I always come in and get the Hawaiian poke bowl and it never disappoints.

The crew working there consistently deliver well put together food and could not be more polite and easy going.

    "text": "Greetings! I recently undertook a diet by which I lost over 60 pounds in 12 months. Needless to say, my dietary requirements have drastically changed as a result, and I avoid restaurants as a general rule, because of their large portions. But the True mark of a good eatery is their ability to work with a customer and adapt to his requests.  I had a couple hours to kill between events at church, and so I resolved to hang out in an air-conditioned restaurant. Since I was eating no meat on that day, I visited Chula with their delicious fresh fish in mind. I approached the gentleman at the counter and first queried whether he could just make me a fillet of something on display. He said no, this fish was for home preparation only. I can understand that. So I asked what else could be done. He unhelpfully directed me back to the chalkboard menu. Now I love pokebowls and the other items on the menu, but their portions are huge, and even the small-sized offerings began at about $12. There were two \"Children's Menu\" items; one was basically mac-and-cheese: very non-nutritious, not fish at all. As I refused everything on the menu, the gentleman indicated that there was nothing else to be done for me, and so I left hungry.  So this is a lesson to me personally. Not every place can be accommodating for a simple dietary requirement such as small portions. Perhaps I could call ahead more often to test the waters. But I am committed to my diet, and I am dismayed that this epidemic of sheer unadulterated gluttony in these USA has this kind of effect on restauranteurs.",

The tuna tasted fresh but it was almost like they just threw the sandwich together because there were large chucks of tuna that were hard to keep in the sandwich when picking it up for a bite.  The Noble bread that the sandwich was on was fresh and tasty as well as the side salad.  On the other hand my two friends enjoyed the chef's choice sashimi platter and the chef's special which they both said was excellent.  I just found that this place is better for taking home fresh seafood and preparing it yourself versus eating here.  Overall the atmosphere is pleasant and the staff are helpful and knowledgeable. The food really didn't excite me but that could be due to what I ordered, but I will definitely be back to take out fresh seafood for home cooking.",

I will definitely be back to try some of their menu items, and buy any fresh fish I may need.   The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable also, which is always an added bonus that keeps a new customer coming back.

On the first Saturday of every month they serve lobster rolls, and on the second Saturday of every month they serve oysters. We went for the oysters, luckily we didn't have to wait in line (apparently there are long lines for their lobster rolls), we ordered at the counter and found a seat to wait for our food. It's BYOA, so we brought a bottle of wine, they uncorked it (no corking fee) and provided glasses. The oysters arrived pretty quickly with an onion-y sauce which I didn't like (I hate onions), so we asked them for another option or a spicy sauce. They brought out a homemade sauce which tasted like wasabi, soy sauce and something else I couldn't place. I've never had wasabi/soy sauce with oysters before but it was really good! The oysters were also really tasty, and customer service was great. I definitely want to go back to try one of their lobster rolls.",

    "text": "I lived around 3 minutes from Chula Seafood for over a year, but had no idea that it existed until now. It's located in a small unassuming plaza on Hayden and Roosevelt, about a 10 minute drive south east of old town Scottsdale or slightly north of Tempe marketplace. It's a strange location (in between a liquor store and a pho restaurant) and really hard to see, but all in all worth the scavenging. Now before I get knocked for not giving it the full 5 stars I will start by saying that the seafood quality is as fresh as everyone says and thinks it is (which is hard to come by in the middle of Arizona.  As one can see in the pictures they have a changing fresh menu written up on a chalkboard and first impressions were good. Though small, every single table was filled with people constantly leaving and standing in line. The employees were respectful and very kind, taking their time with each customer. I would caution people on a time crunch to come either before or after the lunch rush hits because with a customer base/popularity like that you're not getting in and out unless you want it as take out which I never recommend for fresh seafood anyways.  The food: I had the Hawaiian poke ($14 for the regular and $18 for the XL). To be honest I would have tried something else, but I feel like to understand a restaurant you should have one of their more generic popular dishes. My specific bowl came with tuna, radishes, edamame, pineapple, some nuts, onions, as well as their (I call it) vinaigrette over rice. The fish was great as expected, and the balance of all the flavors and textures worked very well with each other; however, it also came with sliced raw carrots. I didn't quite understand the idea behind that because I felt like the strong carrot taste pushed the other flavors away. The main reason for the imperfect score is that the poke itself didn't stand out from other poke bowls. Any other poke restaurant can build the same flavor profile with the same ingredients, it's just that this place happened to have better seafood. I know... what is this guy talking about? Long story short if I were basing it on the seafood alone (for example sashimi) this would have a perfect 5 out of 5, but since I got the bowl it falls short of being AMAZING.  As a person who also works in the industry I appreciate the local connections that they have/support I.e. Noble Bread and Homeboys. I also appreciate the quality and care these guys have towards their seafood. Some of the fish they were selling seemed a little pricy from what I've seen, but hey market prices are constantly changing so that's not a big deal.",

    "text": "This was my first visit to Chula Seafood and it was memorable! The place is spotless, service is friendly and informed. The seafood is beautiful, fresh, and so delicious. We ordered the thai peanut bowl, bagel sandwich, 2 pieces of swordfish, and a piece of tuna to go. We couldn't wait for the long drive (45 min) home so we started on the peanut bowl in the car! The albacore tuna used was superb - so fresh! I prepared both the swordfish and the tuna on the stove top - nice sear on both! The fish was flavorful and tender - amazing! This could get to be a real addiction. Thankfully my daughter found this wonderful place for excellent, fresh, healthy fish.  I can't wait to go back!  By the way, yes, the place is located in a very unassuming strip plaza but it is easy to spot, lots of parking right near the door, and like I said, it is super clean inside. I really don't care where they are located - it is what's inside that counts! Thanks John for bringing fabulous fish to the seafood starved desert southwest!",

They have their own fishing boat in California waters, and harpoon swordfish for the restaurants. Harpooning swordfish is actually more sustainable than using nets, which may capture and kill species that are not intended for the table. I ordered the Thai peanut bowl, which has sushi grade albacore, rice noodles, carrots, radish, peanuts, sesame seeds, sweet peppers, all with a creamy, mildly spicy sauce. It turned out to be a tasty combination that I enjoyed, and I look forward to trying the spicy tuna bowl and the Hawaiian poke bowl. Check out the online menu and see if they have something that appeals to you. Please note that they are open Weds. through Sun.",

I instantly saw the amazing reviews and figured this would be a healthy and interesting place to try (vs the mexican food i was going to get). I was greeted by friendly man who walked me through the whole menu and explained everything in detail to me, i was immediately intrigued and ready to eat. I got the Spicy Tuna Bowl and a green tea.  Oh my... the fish was fresh and the whole bowl had so much flavor and it was a perfect portion size. The Tea was also amazing!! They mentioned they made it in house and i wasn't disappointed. I had to take pictures of the menu so i can come back and try them all. The worker did mention that they change their menu every season which is refreshing and always peaks my interest. :)  The only downside is that its too close to my house so i will be having to visit quite often! Darn! lol  On a side note- I went to Ahipoke bowl the day before.... and im never going back there after having this.",

I didn't argue, just took them off.   The food is very good! The sweet & sour poke salmon bowl was delicious. Had unusual ingredients like smoked pineapple & blistered peppers - I love to eat thinks that are hard for me to make (eg - smoker, super hot grill).   You can tell this is a local favorite, many of the customers were greeted by name, or asked if they wanted \"the usual\".  A couple of folks came in for bagels (?!?) & got chastised... \"jeez Maria! It's after 11!! We sold out an hour ago!!\"   I would suggest the owners think about the SUPER strong smell of fish though. I almost walked out when I opened the door.

Tuna used in Hawaiian style poke was so fresh, never been frozen. In fact all the seafood they sell here is fresh, never been frozen.  I really liked their slightly spicy tuna, all the fresh sides they served in the bowl, I kept glancing at the menu to see what I can order next.  Staff is very friendly and professional. They really do care about their customers. Nice and simple decor. Very clean inside.  They sell seafood here too. Next time when I want to eat sashimi or serve poke at a party, I know where to go.",

Only con is that it's a little bit pricier and the portions are a little smaller than my old go-to (Ahipoke) that I can't afford to come here too often.  Got the sweet and sour salmon poke which was great but the jalapeno peppers were SO spicy - maybe it should be called the sweet, sour and spicy poke. I tried to pick them out but there were some pesky seeds were hiding and BAM  - bonfire in my mouth :(  Still a great find though! Looking forward to coming back :)",

Although you have to drive through a desolate and somewhat uninviting parking lot, the indoor decor will transport you to a small town seaside restaurant/market. They have an impressive selection of swordfish skewers, sea bass, scallops, and more. I will definitely have to swing by here sometime to pick up something to grill for dinner. The man at the register had such a bright personality and had me laughing through the whole process. I ordered a thai peanut poke and ginger ponzu salad to-go. I've never had poke with peanut noodles before and I'm so glad I've discovered it now...I'm a huge fan! Paired with the savory noodles are refreshing pieces of albacore. Nom. The ginger ponzu was an excellent choice for a hot and humid summer day. It wasn't too salty and had just the right amount of sauce:salad:albacore ratio. I highly recommend Chula and I will definitely be a returning customer.",

    "text": "Q:  What kind of music should you listen to while fishing? A:  Something catchy!  From San Diego, CA straight to Scottsdale, AZ, the fish can only be fresher if it was catapulted 366 miles right into their storefront.  That's right, The Heflin family fished and shipped these fishies right from their boat, Chula, on the Pacific Coast!  In a somnolent plaza on Hayden and Roosevelt sits Chula Seafood.  Enter the door and you'll find yourself in a nautical themed eatery with smiling faces behind the counter.  A greeting, an introduction, and the helpful, \"Let me know if you have any questions\" was given politely.  A Hawaiian Style Poke, Thai Peanut, a Basil & Mint Limeade, and an Iced Tropical Green Tea was ordered.  After lunch, I ordered another Hawaiian Style Poke bowl and a Macaroni Salad with Spam to-go  Here's the break-down:  * Hawaiian Style Poke ($14): Dainty cubes of yellowfin tuna mixed heavily with soy, thinly sliced cucumbers, carrots, watermelon radishes, pineapple, onions, edamame, macadamia nut, ginger, and garlic topped with sesame seeds and served on top rice.  All the interesting textures and flavors unify into a satisfying dish.  No modified or red-dyed tuna here, folks.  This is fresh tuna and it's delicious and clean.  The pineapple was a welcoming burst of bright flavor while the veggies gave it a nice crispness and the macadamia nut made things crunchy.  There was great balance here in this bowl!   * Thai Peanut ($12):  Perfectly cut cubes of albacore tuna mixed aggressively in peanut sauce and topped with carrots, scallions, radishes, cucumbers, sweet peppers, house kimchi, and topped with sesame, Thai basil, mint, and cilantro on top of rice noodles.  The peanut sauce they used reminded me more of the earthy flavorful Indonesian peanut sauce rather than the typical sweet peanut sauce served in Thai restaurants.  It gave a nice creamy mouthfeel.  The herbs used helped break the monotonous flavor while the veggies gave the bowl much needed texture.  It was a pleasant surprise and a welcomed one.  The noodles made this bowl immensely filling.    * Macaroni Salad with Spam (No idea how much):  Where did they find macaroni pasta so big?  This didn't quite taste like the Hawaiian mac salad I'm accustomed to and it certainly didn't have that overbearing mayonnaise that I'll guilty admit to liking, but it was a solid side dish.  I didn't really taste any salty Spam.  I wouldn't get this again.  * Basil & Mint Limeade ($4):  Strong and pungent, the basil and mint slaps you in the face!  It's refreshing and pairs nicely with the Thai Peanut Bowl.  * Iced Tropical Green Tea ($2.50): It's just iced tea and that's good enough for me.  Portions are smaller and prices are high but the quality is amazing.  I really want to stop in on a Saturday when they sell their $10 Bagel Sandwiches.  It's essentially lox and bagel but with fish this fresh, I'm pretty sure it'll be the best lox you can get!  I'll be counting fishies before I sleep tonight.  You won me over, Chula.  Please reciprocate my love via a pound or two of poke.  Thank you.",

My coworker was raving over Chula Seafood for quite some time and said if I loved poke (or seafood in general), I should stop settling at other spots and give this one a go. The verdict? It's amazing. Chula Seafood, you've won me over. All of their seafood is fresh and high quality. There hasn't been an item on their menu or the special of the day that I haven't loved (or completely obsess over). My all time favorite is their spicy tuna bowl. I love that each of their bowls is crafted specifically and are made as ordered. It isn't like other places where you build your own. I haven't gotten any fresh seafood from their case, but I'm looking forward to when I need it knowing that everything is as fresh as it can get.

The swordfish pieces were the perfect size and had no skin or blood lines, unlike swordfish bought elsewhere.  There was no fishy smell and the swordfish tasted clean, mild and moist. We grilled it at home with North African spices and yogurt sauce, served with saffron couscous. This is the best-quality swordfish I've had.",

On the menu, it says that the bowl has macadamia nut, ginger, garlic, cucumber, radish, pineapple and of course tuna. My bowl had everything except macadamia nut, ginger and garlic, instead I got carrot, daikon and some other kind of radish...it was a bowl of crunch crunch crunch...I am not a fan. The portion was small, $14 for a regular size and it sure did not fill me up. I had to find something else to eat afterwards. I have had better poke at other places. I gave this place two stars because at least, their poke is fresh.",

We loved the ceviche, which was unlike any other - with acorn squash and Peruvian corn. I'll forever dream about the Hawaiian bowl and my hubby, who is a big fan of pad Thai, loved the Thai peanut noodle bowl. We took fresh ahi and salmon home for dinner and made sushi ourselves with delicious results.   The owners were so friendly and helpful. This place is a hidden gem and we can't wait to visit again soon!!!",

Menu:  While Chula has a great everyday menu they also do some limited dishes towards the end of the week. Thursday - Pastrami smoked salmon sandwich (delicious!) Friday - Chef Juan's Friday Feature (incredible one-off dishes. Limited item, call ahead) Saturday - Salmon bagels!! (limited item, call ahead)  Chula also supports other great food purveyors in the valley such as Noble Bread, Super Chunk & Homeboys Hot Sauce to name a few.

If you want a poke bowl, sandwich or fresh catch to take home you won't be disappointed with your options.  My absolute faves are the Thai poke bowl and pastrami crusted smoked salmon for later.

I have been driving by it on Hayden for almost two years and yesterday I stopped in.  Yes I was angry at myself for having taken so long to check this place out.  It's a combination fish market and restaurant. A fairly appealing assortment of fresh fish for those who would prepare their meal themselves.  I chose the Spicy Tuna bowl. It was sublime. I ordered the extra large portion and it was more than a full meal. But what was great was how delicious it was. Almost six ounces of tuna sitting atop rice, seared green peppers, slices of avocado and a variety of other accompaniments.  The service at the counter was very friendly and the gentleman taking your order and money brings your order and addresses you by your name.

    "text": "I couldn't agree more with the other fellow yelpers on this one.   Chula Seafood is the proof that even in Arizona you can still get the freshest of the fish. Most of the seafood comes from the Pacific with the exception of scallops (which I particularly love) coming from Massachusetts.  Prices are fair considering that we are in the desert where scarceness of quality dominates. They also have sandwiches and bowl if you want to sit there for a quick bite of the ocean. I'm very excited to go back!   Eat more fish! Eat Chula! ;)",

There are two tables outside and my dinner companion and I sat at one of them. The man working the counter said we were the first people to sit outside in months. We were excited to try some poke here and ordered the Thai peanut bowl and the Hawaiian style poke bowl. I noticed most people were coming in and ordering their wholesale fresh seafood to go, which they are well-known for.  It was nice to be able to split two bowls as they were totally different in size, taste and texture. I preferred the Hawaiian one, which had yellowfin tuna, cucumber, carrot, radish, mango, macadamia nut, onion, edamame, soy, sesame, ginger, garlic, all on top of rice. Phew! It was so tasty and needed nothing extra. I could've done without the radishes though. The Thai peanut had rice noodles instead of rice as well as albacore tuna, carrot, scallion, radish, cucumber, sweet pepper, house kimchi, sesame, thai basil, mint and cilantro. This was a good bowl but I expected the noodles to be softer. Still, an excellent mix of flavors and we each had one as our favorite. All in all, a superb place to come eat and I still want to come on a Saturday when they have their smoked salmon bagel sandwich.",

We had trouble deciding between the Hawaiian and Thai Peanut bowls, so the staff let us try the different tunas in each... friendly move! We liked the albacore tuna more so we went with the Thai Peanut. The food came out pretty quickly (as you'd expect with poke). The bowl was tasty, but a bit too spicy for me and my wife (and we normally handle spice pretty well). The fish was excellent... fresh flavor with tasty marinade. There wasn't as much kimchi as we were hoping but the noodles were pretty good.   I was a little disappointed that EVERYTHING was plastic and they didn't have a recycling bin available. For a place that makes a claim for \"sustainable\" fish, it seems appropriate to also demonstrate sustainability for the environment.",

I was disappointed with the construction of my $18 XL cerviche bowl served in a clear plastic disposable bowl with quinoa as the primary base and garnished with greens, pickled veggies, and slivers of fresh serrano or jalapeno peppers.  The cerviche in my bowl was not sufficiently drained - and thus what I ended up with was a cerviche-topped mushy bowl of quinoa and a 1/2 inch deep pool of cerviche 'juice' pooled at the bottom.  The overpowering 'juice' coated and floated everything in my bowl.  IMHO what these folks should have done, since the cerviche was being served in a bowl over quinoa, is thoroughly drained and redrained the cerviche just before adding it into the bowl.  Would have made a huge (positive) difference.  Serving cerviche in a bowl atop other items requires a different serving technique versus just serving it in a bowl by itself.  Maybe I'm being too harsh - but that seems simple and obvious to me.  My dining companion tried the spicy tuna bowl ($14) - and deemed it pretty good though a modest portion of fish for the price.  In any event - these folks are using fresh, high quality ingredients and this level of quality, fresh seafood in these parts is a rare find outside of sushi restaurants.  Budget $15-$20/pp for lunch.",

I am thanking my lucky stars that happened, even though the regular size would have been sufficient (cause I'm stuffed now) it was so dang delicious that I was stoked to get the larger one! Yellow fin is my favorite and I haven't had great yellow fin like that since I was last in Florida!!! The price was really reasonable for the quality and quantity.

Mac salad was Mac daddy delicious. On my next visit I will definitely grab some beautiful fish to take home and cook. Staff was super friendly and the environment was clean and cool. Definitely worth checking out. (I think the Wednesday special is the salmon pastrami, it's on my radar ;)",

This South Scottsdale establishment is a must try and once you do, you'll be hooked. Icing on the cake: the staff, chefs and owners are the most down to earth, coolest cats you'll encounter in the local food scene. It's truly a \"third place\" where where like-minded people come together, connecting through a mutual respect and appreciation for clean eating, great company and farm- (or in this case, an ocean)-to-table experience. As an added bonus, it literally is a 1 minute drive to Singh Meadows where you can get all the farm-to-basket veggies to compliment your fresh fish for the week! We can't wait for the new Central and Camelback location to open in Fall 2018 so when we're in the Uptown Plaza area, we can enjoy more of the extraordinary, healthy cuisine we crave.",

Myself however, I could live off raw fish.   The space is on the smaller side, very well put together and has a modern feel. They are a sustainable fish market and eatery. The menu consists of assorted poke bowls, ceviches and platters. I ordered the Thai Peanut Noodle bowl - sub noodles for a bed of greens. The sauce was very flavorful! Complimented by fresh mint and cilantro, I loved every bite. The tuna was extremely fresh and had zero weird after smells/tastes. they offer rotating daily specials as well. They are also a BYOB restaurant, pretty fun! Pricing was to  be expected for fresh sustainable seafood and worth every penny in my opinion.   The lady behind the counter was super friendly! You can tell she loves her job, has a passion for quality food and loves her community. She was ready to answer all of my questions without hesitation. I can't wait to go back and try more!",

I also took some scallops to cook at home that I swear could have been eaten raw they we're so succulent, fresh and tasty. I resturned that next Tuesday at 10 when they opened and I was the 3rd of 5 customers waiting before opening. While we were there they ran out of 3 dishes simply because they are delish and the ingredients are without a doubt fresh. The inside decore is casual but very cute.

When you walk into the restaurant you're greeting by staff who exhibit warm genuine smiles with enthusiasm for their fare. The restaurant is tastefully decorated, and spotlessly clean. Counter service with a fresh fish offering in case you'd like to make sushi, or another meal at home.  Oh, the food?  \"Kick A!!!\"  Exceptional. Just Terrific. Colorful, pleasing to the eye and palette. Nice combinations of fresh ingredients and offering terrific unique tastes in each bite.   High standards here, and they hit all of them.  If you want to feel welcome: come here  If you want to enjoy fresh food which is uniquely presented: come here  If you want a nicely decorated, spotless environment to enjoy your meal: come here   The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and clearly take ownership in what they do.  We enjoyed our experience here immensely - and wished we didn't so far (2500 miles) away.  We were cruising North to ride motorcycles in the Sedona area, but if we were \"local\" we'd be regulars for sure!",

I was undecided between the Hawaii Poke bowl and the Thai Peanut bowl but the staff left me sample a bit of the yellowfin and a bit of the albacore. We decided to go with XL Thai Peanut bowl based on the albacore. The noodles were great BUT the bowl was too spicy for our taste. I wish the description mentioned how spicy it was! Other than that, our overall experience was fantastic.   On a side note: the fish are all sustainably sourced but the restaurant only uses plastic bowls and plastic ware without any recycle stations. Hopefully Chula Seafood can move toward a more environmentally friendly dining option.",

We got the Toro Bowl and loved everything about it. The fish was unbelievably fresh and a large portion, the little pickled mushrooms added a nice zing, loved the little greens in it and then seasoned rice and masago!

I consider this place to be a very upscale of Ahi poke bowls. I ordered the white fish ceviche and my husband ordered the sweet and sour poke Bowl. The fish was really fresh and tasted really good. it didn't taste like most sushi places that you would expect to taste like, and they didn't fill it with other stuff to make you more full. You can tell whoever prepared the food took their time.   Like I said I was skeptical, but it was absolutely delicious. Customer service was amazing.

Small location, but every time I have went on the weekend it was no issue sitting down. The only negative is the prices are high and the portions are small, but I guess you are getting what you pay for. So don't plan on taking home leftovers.",

Also bought some noble bread from them for a panzanella and that was great.  If you like to cook seafood, make this place your go to fish market. Fresh noble bread Wednesday and fridays. Wide selection of poke bowls with unique ingredients. If you like your fish cooked the have an amazing tuna sandwich made with toasted noble bread and a confit tuna that has been poached/cooked in infused I love oil and is tender and flaky and has an amazing bright fresh flavor.  I hate to share a good find (selfish me :)), but this place is a gem that I can't keep to myself!",

    "text": "This was my first time here, and it is located in an unsightly strip mall.  The inside of The restaurant seats less than a dozen but is tastefully decorated and will be a great place to get poke.  I ordered the Hawaiian poke bowl which was $14. Although it was not a large dish, it is about quality of the fish and presentation.  The vegetables were uniformly cut and aesthetically pleasing.   There was also a sufficient quantity of yellow fin tuna with good sesame flavor.  The tuna cuts were not uniform and the cubes seemed a little big in size for the dish, but that is just my opinion.  I was eating with chopsticks and 2 or 3 pieces of fish in your mouth seemed unbalanced to the rest of the cuts of vegetables in the bowl.  My observation was that great care was taken in the vegetable slicing, but the same attention was not made to the tuna which is the highlight.  for the price point, I would expect both.  Overall, flavor always wins out and I would definitely return to try some of the other dishes. You can also pick up some good quality fresh fish that has been caught from the Pacific down near San Diego.",

We went there on a Saturday afternoon around a quarter-to-two and found this place completely packed.    It seemed rather strange that a small restaurant would be so crowded for what we thought would be the end of the lunch rush.   Turns out that is Chula's time to shine.  That's when their special kicks in on fresh oysters.  When I say fresh, we are  not  talking frozen.    These gems from the salty waters of the Pacific are transported from San Diego multiple times a week without having to mumify these slippery suckers in frozen ice.  The result is a taste in your mouth that is like a kiss from the sea.  This dish is truly a pearl and a diamond in the rough that's clearly not a dime a dozen.  We also had the Hawaiian Poke, the Thai Peanut Noodle dish, and the Spicy Tuna Bowl.  They did not disappoint.   I was really amazed that they really had the wherewithal to prepare these Asian-influenced dishes to perfection.  The authenticity of these bowls bowled me over.  I strongly recommend that you do your chillin' at Chula for awesome fresh oysters and kick butt bowls!",

My friend let them make him a surprise bowl and it was top notch too, like the off-the-menu stuff the rest of us ordered.   The line grew very long, very quickly. We arrived 2 minutes before the lunch rush and had to turn a 4 person table in to 5. One of our party waited 20 minutes to get there food because they got caught in the line, the rest of us were served 5 minutes after ordering. I could see this being frustrating for those in the back of the line but I'm just reviewing my experience, right?  Because of the price, it's not an every day thing but certainly if the company is paying for lunch, I'm in all day.",

Going this late you risk them being sold out of what you may want so call ahead if you are going for something specific.   Saw they had fresh and smoked scallops, decided to try both. The guy at the counter recommended we get 6 instead of 4 smoked scallops if we were scallop lovers, we are so glad he did! It's such a different texture/experience we were glad to have more. The fresh were very well cleaned, not grainy. Seared them on both sides at home and they were a melt in your mouth texture. The smoked scallops have a denser, more meaty feel. The contrast between the two cooking styles was amazing and fun to try.   VERY fresh, will definitely be back to try their other offerings.",

I went home and cooked them up, and let me tell you, they were the BEST scallops I have ever had. They are large and sweet. After this I decided to eat here, I've tried just about everything on this menu at this point, my favorite by far is the sashimi. Specifically the scallops. Also you have got to try Kyles candy. It's sweet and delicious. When I see chula on a restaurant menu, I have to get it, because I know the quality is there!  Once they opened their second restaurant I was so excited for them! I love small businesses and to see them succeed is so exciting to me. The second restaurant is much larger and has a bigger menu. However, this will always be my favorite. Love Saturday's when they have their bagel special. Absolutely phenomenal. You want fresh seafood in the desert? Everyone says you can't get great seafood in the Arizona desert, boy are they wrong!

I do agree with another reviewer that the fish smell was strong upon walking in, but I reminded myself it was a fish market (duh!), so don't let that scare you off.  The bagel was DELICIOUS! The smoked salmon was super fresh with great flavor, and I loved all the toppings that were included on it. I also appreciate how friendly the staff was - I can't have dairy and they were nice enough to sub the cream cheese for a spread of avocado. The owner also came over to where I was sitting to check on me throughout the meal, which felt very personal!  They have a super cute merch setup and truly had the longest line of people wanting to buy fish from their case, so it's on my list to go back and purchase some to cook myself! I've also heard amazing things about the tuna poke bowl so I will definitely visit again soon!",

Once I was able to get into them we had less than 2 oz of salmon on each sandwich and for the price I paid, it was not worth it. I will be calling in the morning as this is unacceptable.

They run a fish ship off the coast of San Diego for swordfish, which is why they have peculiar hours. The days this shop is closed is when they are off the California coast.   Anything else I believe they import FRESH from around the world, and know how to cook/prepare it including their small kitchen in-sight for poke bowls. They do not appear to own refrigerators because what you see packed on ice is what will be sold for the day, from what the counter guy told me. I've purchased fresh Faroe Islands salmon from them at a fairly hefty price (more than what I usually pay for Fry's frozen filets), but worth the investment because I was advised on how to prepare it (I asked!). The bowls are pretty awesome too, but a little expensive for the weight of what you get.   If you have a moment and there is space, take some time to eat a poke bowl and talk to the staff. You'll walk away with a full belly and a smarter brain.",

Most of them had good amount of heat due to sliced up jalapenos, but salmon bowl had little extra and my son absolutely loved it.   Their limeade is also amazingly spot on, perfect balance between sweetness and tartness.  Can't wait to go back.",

One difficulty that has always been a constant in Arizona, finding fresh fish without paying an arm and leg for it. Search no further. Chula Seafood sells fresh fish! Not only is it unbelievably fresh, its a fair price. The reason why, the owners have fishing boats in California(hence the name Chula), and they cut out the middle man.  I have not tried any of the food on the menu, but I would have to believe if they use the fish they sell, everything will be great! Support local, small business!",

I love the fact that he drives twice a week to San Diego just to get fresh fish to feed his customers. Now that's dedication to provide his customers with the best of the best! I had the Hawaiian poke bowl and it was fabulous. Also important to note that the interior of the place made me feel like I was grubbing at somewhere in Carlsbad, CA. Very cool. After all, what's good food without good ambiance.  The only downside is that the portions are modest, so if you're really hungry I suggest you order the XL bowl.

They are located in the same storefront where Pesto Prima used to operate, just down the building from Pub Rock.  Oh boy!!! After having a dish for lunch, it is hard to dispute their 5 star rating!  The flavors are unbelievably good and the amount is just right. Next time I want to overdo it and order an XL bowl.  The food is super savory and by the looks and taste I believe they deliver exceptional quality. In my opinion, for what is included in the Poke bowl, the price is right. Of course it will be more than the run of the mill fast food restaurants...this is by no means \"fast-food\".  I am happy to contribute yet another 5 star rating to their Yelp reviews and I am for certain I will not be the last person to submit a high rating. I will be back.  Two locations. One in San Diego, CA and one in Phoenix (Scottsdale), AZ. Open Wednesday through Saturday.  Support your local businesses.",

    "text": "Being born and raised in Hawaii I had all but given up on the idea of finding great poke when I moved to to a landlocked state on the Mainland.   I went into this place with low expectations and needless to say they were thoroughly destroyed. This place is legit folks... LEGIT. In Hawaii or California this place would hold its own with against other poke spots, in Arizona it's not even a contest. This place is so far above anything else around it's not even funny.   So far I've had the Hawaiian Style ahi, Thai Peanut and Spicy Tuna poke bowls. Each one was delicious and different enough from the others to warrant trying them all. The fish isn't frozen and you can tell when you take a bite- texture and taste are fresh and just perfect.   I've also tried the Salmon Bagel and Confit Tuna Sandwich, both of which were served on local breads which is cool.  You can tell the guys that run this place really care about what they do and are passionate about their fish. They are always helpful and willing to offer recipes and cooking suggestions for any fish they happen to have that day.",

They have specials on Sunday for their bagel and lox. The poke bowl is amazing as well. I had the smoked salmon bowl which was absolutely amazing, spicy, and fresh. I always love making sushi and cooking with fish so l will for sure be buying my fish here every single time. The price is very negotiable for the quality and quantity of what you get. I'm sure I'm going to be here at least twice a week. This place is amazing and I'm so excited to have found it!",

It's not like Ahipoke or Pokedon where you 'make it yourself' The menu is small but they do it right. I usually come here every Saturday morning to get the salmon bagel and the tuna confit sandwich. YUM! I can't explain it. I've also tried the sweet and sour salmon poke which is also one of my favorites. Pretty spicy too, which I absolutely love. Definitely skip the crispy mac salad, nothing to rave about. The ginger ponzu salad was ok but I think there was just too much acidity in it, it hurt my mouth. But honestly, get the tuna confit sandwich, so noms!",

    "text": "Let me just start this review by saying WOWZA!!! The peeps here are only open from Wednesday to Saturday from 10am -7 pm only. They own a fishing boat in San Diego, so the seafood being served here are super fresh, and never frozen. I heard about this peeps through a friend, and immediately made the trip from Litchfield Park to their location in South Scottsdale to try out their food. Yup, that's about 50 minute drive to, and 1 hour and 20 minutes back in traffic. You know what? It's totally worth the drive.  Let's get down to the food. I had 3 poke bowls. The first one was the ahi tuna bowl. This one is a little bit on the spicy side. I loved it. Just be cautious if you have a little one because of the heat. The second poke bowl was the salmon poke bowl. Aaah, the flavors of the one did a tango in my mouth. It had jalapenos, smoked pineapple, carrot slices, sesame seeds, edamame, and whatever amazing sauce was added to the already delicious salmon cubes. The last poke bowl was a salmon belly tartar kinda bowl. I can't explain this one. It's just yummy. I ate 4 slices of their blue fin tuna, and man... my mouth went to heaven. Melt in your mouth yumlicious. It's really hard to explain the extent of how delicious the fresh fish tasted in my mouth. Simply put, the freshness in the seafood made the poke bowls  better. The peeps here were extremely friendly and helpful. They take the time to explain everything to me. The restaurant is nice and clean. I can't wait to come back here to try more items on their menu, which changes every week depending on the catch of the day. BOOM! Cool or what??",

The homemade kimchi is absolutely great too! Perfect flavor and perfect spice. I'm a big eater but with the noodles in this bowl it is very filling. I left very satisfied.  My wife had the Salmon Bagel that is available on Saturday only. It was just delicious, they don't use lox like a traditional style bagel, they use smoked, chunked salmon. It was so good that we got two more of them to go to eat later. We commented to the owner how good the actual bagel itself was and he told us they get their bagels from the small, family owned bakery called Super Chunk. He also recommended that we try them, so we did. I'll make that a separate review but WOW! They are awesome too!  Today was great! We found two family owned places and they are both great. We can't wait to back!",

    "text": "This place was my exciting adventure for Thursday dinner. Me a fellow aficionado of Ahipoke (down the road) decided to make a date of exploring Chula Seafood to compare.  Mission accomplished!!  If you've never had poke, I'd start here.  Unfortunately, you'll probably end here too as their fish and sauces and vegetables are so fresh that anything else might be a step down.  I had the Thai peanut, and he had the Hawaiian bowl.  The flavors are fresh and delicious, you can really tell the fish is flown in everyday.  Our comparison notes agreed that Ahipoke is larger quantity and more chipotle style, but hands down Chula wins in the freshness. And to be fair, their portions are generous for a meal.   Since I'm an incessant question asker, we found out that the operator's family does all the fishing themselves from their boat which runs San Diego to Mexico. They also serve as a fish market, and I'll be back this weekend to purchase and explore a new recipe with their scallops which look amazing. Prices are fair for fresh caught seafood, I think a bit cheaper than AJs or Whole Foods though.   I'll keep you posted on my visits here. This won't be the last :-)",

My favorite is ordering a side of sashimi (pay by the pound) and having them dress it with their spicy sauce. The side of sashimi and bowl usually cost me about $20. Worth every penny. Side note: the owner and employees are so laid back and such nice guys that they make running a mom and pop shop appear simple (don't see that every day). Their success with this enterprise is going to fun to watch as they grow it.",

    "text": "Chula Seafood is a small Family Owned and Operated Fishery that specializes in Fresh Sustainable Fish Caught of the Pacific Coast. The specialty fish is the Harpooned Swordfish. They sell several fresh fish choices in mostly 6 oz portions. They also sell locally made artisan foods such as Homeboy's Hot sauce, Noble Bread and other locally made goods.   They offer a limited menu of mostly Poke Bowls, a Tuna Confit Sandwich and on \"Saturdays Only\" a House Smoked Salmon Bagel.  We ordered at the counter and sat ourselves. We shared the Tuna Confit Sandwich and the House Smoke Salmon Bagel. I was surprised that both sandwiches were spicy. Both sandwiches were tasty and both were filled with lots of flavors on very above average breads. The Tuna Confit Sandwich was delicious but the Tuna was dry. I think it was cooked too much or most likely at too high of a temperature but with all the flavors in the sandwich the dryness of the tuna wasn't too noticeable.  We also purchased fresh fish to take home.  Service was exceptional, the man working there was very helpful and thoughtful.  This isn't a fancy place but it seems clean.  Parking is easy and close.  This place is a gem for fresh seafood!",

Cool, feminine form of chulo (From Urban Dictionary).   Hello sexy gorgeous cool seafood!  Hey, a fish market that doesn't smell fishy! The store is spacious, sparkling clean, and holds the freshest seafood you'll find in Arizona. When I walked in I was greeted warmly and one of the family members that runs this shop introduced himself to me. He went over the menu and their fresh fish selections for the day. Everything sounded so good I wanted one of each off the menu! Feeling a bit tropical today, I ended up with the Hawaiian poke bowl ($14) and a lime Arnie ($4). It was made in record time and the poke bowl was a beautiful sight to behold. My first thought was \"Perfection!\" and indeed every element was carefully prepared and compiled together for my bowl. The colors were intense and jewel-like, from the deep rich red of the tuna to the bright kaleidoscope of thinly sliced orange carrot, purple carrot, pink radish and cucumber, the light green edamame, and the brightly yellow mango. Unlike other poke that I've had where the pieces can be thick and unevenly cut, the tuna was cut into perfect cubes and I admired the chef's knife skills with not just the fish but with the sliced vegetables. All these ingredients were perched on a bed of short grain rice.   The marinade on the poke was simple: soy sauce and thinly sliced onion. There was a dusting of sesame seed and a sprinkle of crushed macadamia nut on top. While the tuna was leaning more towards the super salty side for me all the crisp vegetables and the rice helped disperse the concentrated flavor of the fish. The tuna itself was superb. It had a clean pure flavor.  The lime Arnie was super tangy and zesty. It was made with a mix of green tea and limeade.   Their fresh fish and seafood selection looked delectable and I will have to go here again to get some of their seafood by the pound. They can even do special orders for you, and can procure delights such as abalone and spot prawns if they are given notice in advance!  The actual shop is in a faded looking shopping plaza next to a martial arts academy.   Overall I was impressed with the quality and freshness of the food, and also the friendliness of everyone working here. You can tell they take a lot of pride in the product they sell.",

Different from a Hawaiian Poke bowl that you would get in the state of Hawai`i, but still good.  So far, the freshest fish we have found in AZ.  We're just really stoked about being able to buy fresh Ahi so we can make \"Poke To Your Taste\"...(y'know, like on the B.I.)  We will definitely be back to try more things from the menu as well as buy blocks of fresh Ahi.  They have more than just fresh Ahi, so please go check them out and support this awesome source of fresh seafood!",

This. Is. It.  Fish this fresh and dressed to perfection in poke form in the desert?  Unheard of until now!  We got the Tuna Confit sandwich, served on  Noble bread and brilliantly topped with a cripsy house made gardineria.  The flavors were perfectly bright and citrusy.  The Hawaiian poke bowl was a rainbow of super fresh veggies; no filler veggies here!  The short-grained rice was perfeclty cooked.  The tuna was so fresh, the texture was unreal.  The dressing did not overwhelm and packed plenty of flavor.  The balance of all these flavors together was unbelievable.  Next time, we will get here earlier to try the Saturday smoked salmon sandwich.  We will be back!",

Don't be deceived by the random outdoor strip mall- the restaurant/store is decorated well and is warm and inviting. The service is great and the best part about this place... the food! They use local breads and baked goods (you can totally taste the difference). My go-to is the tuna sandwich and the salmon pastrami sandwich. When I feel like treating myself, I order the sashimi platter. The fish is so darn fresh and you can really tell the difference. The texture is on a whole different level of good. I love that they have local goods available for purchase. My only wish is that they offered some of their daily specials on different days of the week. I work during the week so I've never had the chance to try the chili melt. I have yet to purchase raw items to take home to make, but the guys are happy to give suggestions on how to prepare.",

Service: Ordered at the counter and the man brought it our table which is standard. What I did appreciate was that he went around the room asking each table how our food was. I told him it was salty, but I'm not sure he heard me. He never responded.   Food: Hawaiian Style Poke Bowl. The pineapple was sweet and the veggies were crisp. Unfortunately, there was just WAY too much soy sauce. I picked off everything in the bowl except for the rice (1/3 of the bowl) which is sad considering it's $14. The pineapple helps with the saltiness but there weren't enough pieces for all the rice. It would've been a perfect mixture of sweet and salty.   Either ask for no soy sauce or less of it in the Hawaiian Style Poke Bowl. I think there might've been soy sauce by the water dispenser so you can adjust how much goes in it.   Definitely worth the visit for fresh seafood and a good meal! I would love to try out their other menu items.",

The restaurant itself is in a nondescript little strip mall, but the inside is cute and cozy. It's a small space with about 8 tables inside and 2 outside on the sidewalk.  It's a walk up and order type of place, and the staff are really helpful and knowledgeable. We tried the Hawaiian poke bowl and the daily special, which was a pastrami smoked salmon sandwich. The poke bowl had the freshest tuna in an amazing sesame soy sauce, edamame, cucumber, pineapple and more on top of white rice. It was seriously the best poke I've ever had. Poke bars are so popular now, and this put them all to shame. The pastrami smoked salmon was great too. The pastrami spices paired perfectly with the smoky, flaky salmon. It was served on a soft roll with coleslaw and pickles. The poke bowl was our favorite, and I'm already craving it again.  If you feel like cooking, they also have a  seafood counter. You can take home everything from fresh scallops and a variety of fish, to smoked seafood.",

    "text": "I kind of hate to post this review because the restaurant feels a bit like an insider, hidden gem. Nowhere location, unassuming storefront, no marketing that I've seen. But this place is seriously good and deserves kudos.   Fresh seafood, great combinations, well-thought-out menu, and a kind of competent, cool, no-fuss service that I miss from NY (even though these guys are soooo not New Yorkers). My favorite is the sweet and sour salmon, which is fantastic if you like your savory with more than a dash of sweet. And the texture and taste of the rice is terrific too.  We make the schlep out there almost every week, an hour round-trip. That's how good it is.",

    "text": "Amazingly fresh!!!! Just like the reviews said (which is why we decided to try this place and drive past 3 others)   They bring in their own FRESH WHOLE fish  from CA twice a week!  ...Then cut the fish properly as well making sure there's no sinew  at all, it's totally worth the price as it's the highest quality fish I've found in AZ In The 17 years we have lived here. I'm originally from the gulf area so I love seafood  Price average will run you $12-14 per person. Worth it!!! I'm cheap normally so Trust me!!!  Very accommodating for my diet restrictions too. We're eating low carb and I'm allergic too pineapple  but the owner didn't bat an eye. He made sure pineapple didn't touch my food and sub'd out rice for mixed green salad.   It doesn't even smell like fish in here which is a good sign. If you ever smell fish in a sushi restaurant I hope you know you  should run.   Only open Wed- Sat which makes it even more special in my opinion. You can dine in, order to go, or buy a verity of things to cook at home.   We came on a Saturday and ate in then bought some smoked salmon pastrami for breakfast on Sunday.",

Very good customer service, would return again! I love that you can buy fish from them as well, the chimichurri swordfish kabobs looked too good to be True. Love what they are doing, hope they keep the small shop feel as they become more popular!",

When others also recommended it....Bernie Kantak, Jacob Cutino, Donnie Hawk, and Brent Kille...it becomes a complete mandate! We had the Hawaiian Style Poke, Thai Peanut, and Confit Tuna Sandwich in our usual over-ordering-can-we-taste-it-all sort of mentality. Oh yeah...the mac and spam salad (Hawaiian influence, natch) was playfully delicious. Hogan guided us through the menu and it is clear that his passion is infectious. You know that anywhere that features Jacob's Juice (Homeboy's Hot sauce) and Noble Bread is already high on the list and the freshest of seafood (brought in twice a week from San Diego). The preparation by Chef Juan is simply superb....simply allowing the freshest of ingredients to marry together. This will be a delightful go-back!  Thanks again,  Chefs!  Dr. B",

But If they're so conscientious, then why do they serve everything \"eat in\", \"to go\" and drinks completely in plastic with nowhere to recycle. There's too many others tasty Poke places popping up, where you don't leave hungry and feeling like you just got ripped off. One more thing...I'm pretty low key...but when you want to charge that kind of money...at least act like you somewhat appreciate my business. One guy there, stockier, round face, blue eyes. Couldn't crack a smile to save his life. We drove 25 mins to check it out. Won't be doing it again.",
