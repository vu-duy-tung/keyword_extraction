Food coma for days! If my body allowed me to eat 100 sweet pork tacos then I would.",

    "text": "First off I don't like their marketing for the bogo offer that has been circulating Facebook and other websites...it's for a salad or burrito only, not a quesadilla or tacos. The quesadilla uses the same tortilla as the burrito. Chipotle bogo offers are for any menu item, I don't understand why the bogo at cafe rio is just limited to 2 items. Secondly, I find their burritos contain very little meat, it's a lot of rice and other carbs and a lot of fancy dressings to cover the fact there is very little protein in this burrito. Third and finally, they charge extra for things like sour cream, dressing, and salsas, where at chipotle these side items are free. Until cafe rio makes some changes to their marketing and stops charging for little side items, I will stay away from cafe rio!",

I have been going to Rio in UT for many years every time I go skiing there and when one opened in Phx I have been a very loyal and consistent customer.  I took my girlfriend there on Saturday the 25th for her first time and because of the awful service we received from the two males and one female working at 1pm she said it was the worst meal she has ever had.  To start off the staff was standing around, not acknowledging anyone and throwing everyone's food around like they were pissed off to be \"forced\" to be working there.  The staff didn't care about the quality of food they were serving so the tacos my girlfriend ordered were soaking wet to the point she couldn't eat them and my burrito looked like it was thrown down a flight of stairs.  I took a picture or my burrito because of how bad it looked.   The female threw pico at my burrito then threw the tray so hard down the line it folded the container. Everyone in line with us was getting the same treatment and everyone was talking about how poor the service was.  Also because the staff had no care whatsoever the food quality was also terrible and questioning me ever wanting to go spend my money there again.    I wrote this same letter to Cafe Rio's corporate through their website and I haven't had one response letting me know that their employees probably act the way to go because the company doesn't care so why should they.    Don't waste your time or money going to the Cafe Rio in Phoenix!!",

I came back a few days later just to get some queso dip to go (I'd been craving it, okay?), and while it was pretty good, I wouldn't call it life changing.

I thought that paying $7 for a meal with no drinks is pretty steep. Overall, I paid $8.50 for my food and drink. The pork was pretty good- it lives up to its name- \"sweet\" indeed. For all you guys out there who like your meat savory, order something else.   Also, I felt rushed when ordering. It seems like the staff wanted their line to move as fast as possible. I felt that  giving me 3-5 seconds to decide on what I want in my taco was a great inconvenience. Overall, the sweet pork taco was good and the service was mediocre.",

We had 3 orders along with the chips and queso and the order was done online. Not a big or complicated order but when, back at the office, we started eating, we found that 2 of the orders were wrong. One pork salad, one chicken but they each had different requests with ingredients. Because one salad that was ordered was for someone with specific dietary needs, she couldn't eat it. She called Cafe Rio, spoke with the manager to ask that either the salads be replaced or a refund be given. She got a very rude response, the manager asked if she was knew what chicken and pork looked like, said she made the salads herself and they were perfect. Except, they weren't. They were wrong and could have hurt someone if they ate the \"perfect\" salad. Ok, we all make mistakes but this was bad, bad customer service. The supervisor did not any questions, did not apologize but became defensive and oppositional. Since I was the one picking up the order, I know it was not busy at the time of our order. They did grudgingly replace the salads to their credit and I know we will go back but please, Cafe Rio, work on training your staff on customer service! Being understanding and kind doesn't take much but it makes a place to eat more like a favorite place to go.",

Cafe Rio is particularly bad. Their food service station is an absolute mess. They somehow still messed up our order after being corrected twice, probably something to do with their bizarre and disorganized grill situation. None of the veggies looked appetizing. Most disappointing of all, you can't even say you're getting a decent taco because the whole thing is soaked in red, translucent grease and you can't really taste much else.

He was not happy.   Please slow down - at least when it is not so busy and listen to your customer.",

The quesadillas are very good with grilled meat and chicken only.but truthfully in my opinion this isn't a real Mexican restaurant and it sucks. Id pick filibertos anytime over cafe Rio american food.just because you add cilantro doesn't mean its Mexican food lol  anyways the tortillas are bomb by the way and that's about the only thing that's worth tasting.",

This location is not only rude, but they don't listen or care one bit about how they are presenting and making a customers food. Granted we came by at 9:30 (30 minutes before close) but there was no one who even greeted us or and they looked at us like we were just bothering them.   I love their steak (pretty much the only reason I come), and the guy said he had none. Seriously? Ok so you don't want my $1.50 extra for it? I understand it's a rip off, but your loss... The quesadilla was a joke, it looked like something that a child could have put together and they didn't even cut it for us!! But of course it costs more than the burrito, with way less ingredients.   I am NOT happy. Will not come back to this location. The one on baseline and Gilbert road is WAY better. Take your money and taste buds there!",

I added some of their ranch dressing and special crumble cheese to mine and they were wonderful. The taco salads are great also.  Lots of flavor.  Unlike other previous reviewers I do not need a concierge to work my way through a fast casual restaurant.  Read the website, take more than 2 minutes to read signage and ask questions if needed.  Staff is friendly sometimes a little slow in the head but I don't consider this full service.  They have daily specials unlike chipotle or Qdoba and outdoor seating options.  Check out the drink options,  amazing refreshing choices like sugar free strawberry lemonade.  Delicious",

The dining area and food prep areas looked clean from what I could see.  For the health conscious, I don't think they have anything that could be considered \"Healthy\" , even the salad likely has a ton of calories.  4 stars, I will return.",

The place is colorfully decorated, with different colored tables and chairs of all sizes for seating.  Their food is cooked fresh, they will make what you want to order on or off the menu.  I usually go with the shredded beef taco with some kind of beans and rice.  This is a hearty meal, and let me tell you, its filling and delicious. I love their shredded beef, as its really moist and juicy. Their tortilla's are made fresh by hand, and you can watch them  make it as your standing in line.  Overall I love this place, but at times, I feel rushed through line. I also have a hard time hearing the guys behind the counter when they ask me stuff like what I want on my taco.  Honestly, I know my hearing is good, so I think its the noise from behind the counter that drowns them out.  I have to ask them a lot to repeat themselves, and its not that they aren't loud enough....but in between the glass that's separating you and the noise from the kitchen, I have to keep saying \"HUH? ONE MORE TIME PLEASE.\"  Also, sometimes i feel rushed at the register when i pay. I take my time and put my money back in my wallet and make sure I have everything before I take my tray, and sometimes I feel like they want me to hurry up so they can keep the line down, and not have it pile up.  (I know, fussy, right?)  LOL  Overall, I love their food here and I really enjoy eating here. I plan on coming back in the future to eat more, and even though its on the pricier size, I'm definitely a fan!",

    "text": "Food is amazing (5/5), but the staff & service are horrible (1/5 - some of the worst I've ever experienced).   I'm a Cafe Rio addict, and I fell in love with Cafe Rio food a long, long time ago. This is the only Phoenix location that's remotely close to us, so this is where we usually go. I really wish we had a different one nearby, because I'd never set foot in here again, if it were an option. Unfortunately, the cravings for Cafe Rio food live on, and I always end up venturing back, and hoping that the service here will be better than it was last time (it isn't).   Food: The food here is great, when they get your order right. Cafe Rio is much more flavorful and saucy than Chipotle-type joints, and I like their dressings and sauces better than Costa Vida's. Their salad dressing is unreal (the creamy tomatillo, don't bother with the cilantro lime). I would recommend the salad (huge, and definitely the best bang for your buck), tacos, and enchiladas. The burrito is good, and I'm happy that they no longer charge extra for enchilada style, but it always has a little too much rice in it (and not enough flavor) for me. The quesadillas and nachos are pretty greasy. The tostada seems like a good deal, until you realize that if you want guac, it's cheaper to just get the salad, which comes with it. Both desserts are phenomenal, and worth the $4-5!! The chips often taste old.  Tip: Don't order anything with the medium enchilada sauce (burritos & enchiladas) - it has the look and consistency of baby poop. The hot and mild are both good choices! I've had all three.  Service: The workers here always seem confused, as if they don't know what they're doing or how to put the food together, and I've had multiple orders ruined because they put things on that I don't like, or am allergic to. When I tell them that they've gotten my order wrong, they never offer to make me a new one, or make amends in any way, even if it has to do with an allergy. Every other Cafe Rio I've been to has been really good at this, so it's not a company-wide policy, or anything like that. As other reviewers have noted, even if you tell the employees what you want ahead of time, you will have to answer inane questions about everything, step by step. (\"No chips, please.\" \"Okay, chips?\")   To-go orders are never ready on time, and every to-go order I've gotten has had some sort of mistake (wrong dressing, missing dessert, etc).   It's worth noting that I've heard amazing things about the lunch crew here, and how they're efficient, friendly and helpful. I've never been able to come for lunch, so I can't comment on that, but just FYI!  To sum it up, I can't reasonably give this place 1 star, because I will honestly be back, since I love Cafe Rio food, but it'll be a while. I'm so frustrated with the service here, and I don't understand why it never gets better, even after multiple complaints from myself and others.",

In fact, we'd probably be better off.   This was my first visit to a Cafe Rio. Normally if I have a bad experience somewhere, it's not so horrible that I wouldn't give it a 2nd chance. However, there is no way I'd try this place again. The dining room was dirty and obviously hadn't been straightened up all evening. I should have turned around and left upon seeing the 'serving bar' and 'kitchen'. Why, oh why, didn't I!!!???   The food serving bar was FILTHY! I mean, FIlTHY! And one of the workers took his dirty gloved hand and wiped the food from the board into the bin of food that they served from! By the time I got home with my food, I just threw it in the garbage. I was so grossed out. I opened it and it was so greasy. I took a couple of bites, and thinking about the filth, just threw it in the garbage. It was really gross.  Also, I asked for some hot salsa or hot sauce and he looked really miffed saying we have this.... pointing to something red. I said, fine, because I wanted to get out of there. When I got home and opened it, it was enchilada sauce! LOL! What?! Surely they have salsa or some kind of hot sauce there, right? I don't know. It doesn't matter. I'd NEVER go back to a Cafe Rio to find out.",

I called the store and the girl seemed confused but then offered to leave my receipt at the register for me to come by in the couple days to get another meal of what I actually ordered. I agreed and came in the next day for lunch. The guy read back my receipt and I confirmed I wanted all the same things. I got home to the wrong meal again.

My only gripes are that it gets extremely busy at lunchtime (which isn't their fault--they're booming! Just means longer wait) and that the horchata runs out on a fairly consistent basis. When I ask the staff if they can refill the horchata, they look at me like I'm asking them to solve a calculus equation.

Another employee was whacking his broom against the dust pan quite loudly within three feet of the table we were eating at.

Very rude behavior from the staff, and the food was warm at best.  Do not purchase food from this location.

I chose the shredded chicken for my meat and loved it. Hubby got the sweet pork and it was flavorful but a little too sweet. We signed up for their rewards app while in line and I'm glad we did because one of our salads was free! So that's a good little tip for the frugal families :) I just wish they had more fresh salsas to choose from, I don't consider pico de gallo an authentic salsa. They had a ranch and a lime vinegarette to choose from for the salads. I chose the latter and it was alright but would have preferred a salsa. Overall, not bad for the price. I'll be back!",

I have placed an online order for this location on Camelback three times and two of the times it has been horrible. The first order placed, no issues. Hence the reason for a second time ordering online. The second time, the manager stated the order wasn't placed when we had a confirmation number. This pushed our order from being ready at 12:00pm to now being ready at 12:25pm. I chalked this bad experience as a glitch in the system. So today, 3/3/17, I placed an online order.  The order was to be ready at 12:15 pm. I got to the restaurant early and waited in the pick-up line. There were three people in-front of me. When the first person finished up the phone rang and the cashier took the call. He began to take the phone order and 10 minutes later, he still was on the phone and the next person in line still wasn't spoken to or helped. After almost 20 minutes of waiting in line for our already placed orders, I asked to speak to the manager. I explained to her that I understood it was lunch and they were busy but the cashier is still on the phone and the regular line is moving faster than we are. Her response was, \"what's your name\". I gave her my name, she grabbed my food and cashed me out. She was not helpful or supportive. I wasn't looking for a handout but an acknowledgement of the length of time spent in a line and not being helped is unacceptable.   I will continue to go to Cafe Rio but I am not going to support this location until they can hire or train other people to work during the lunch rush hour.",

That item gets 2 out of 5 stars. The grilled chicken tacos were leaving you wanting more flavor. Yeah, the lettuce mix was leafy and crunchy but the Pico de Gallo wasn't up to par. The last thing we tried were the chicken enchiladas and they were just okay. But, at least the chicken wasn't dry. But the sad part was that there wasn't any guacamole to be had.  The service was just okay, nothing special. The young man that made the food was polite and the young lady at the register was also polite and friendly.",

I ordered tacos and my friend had the quesadilla. The best part was the fresh tortillas which were fried up on the grill and nice and crispy! The carnitas I has were delightful but very greasy. The grease was dripping all over, gross. It didn't impact the taste too much however.  I had rice and beans on the side. They were not tasty. A little overcooked I think. I couldn't even eat them and I'm not too picky.  To drink they have everything you could imagine and traditional Mexican faire. I had horchata which was good. Very cinnamony and heavy.",

My coworkers and I ordered online ahead of time because we only have a short time to be away from work to pick up lunch and Cafe Rio is a little further away than we usually go. But we love Cafe Rio! We get there at the time we set online but our food wasn't ready. We waited and waited while the lady at the cash register ignored us. Even after we paid we waited a while. Bottom line: IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FASTER IF WE HAD WAITED IN LINE INSTEAD OF ORDERING ONLINE.  How does that make sense? Why have order ahead if it takes longer? Our stuff should have been made before the other people, not the other way around! We were late getting back to work. Not sure we will order here again, honestly. Every time I've been in to this location, the wait at the register has been a little long. They need more people at the register during lunch hour. The food was good as usual, but very unhappy with my experience.",

The pork is very good though a bit on the sweet side. Standard taco was served with lettuce tomatoes and pico. Rice and black beans accompanied the meal. Drinks are mostly soft drinks, though they serve house made limeade as well.

This location is filthy. Old food sitting on the tables while employees eat. Nothing wiped down or clean. I got a steak salad and a soda (almost $14). They skimped of the steak and the salad was super watery. Just didn't taste good. The lady working the line was struggling. Didn't even use the tongs to put the chips on top of the salad or the cheese. Just reached in with her hand. Glove was on but she didn't know what she was doing. Not happy and seemed bored. Unfortunately I've have similar experiences at Cafe Rio the last couple of year. Go elsewhere.",

Finally this last experience inspired me to write my first Yelp review. Two people in front of me and it took twenty minutes to get through the line. They only ordered one dish each so it's not like I was behind a football team or something.   Kid behind the counter was as inefficient as I've ever seen plus looked stoned. Eyes half shut and glazed over. He struggled to put together each meal. African American kid.. All smiles and chatty but to the staff talking and talking to the girl sweeping the floor while the lines just stacking up behind me.   Management didn't do a thing.. Most of the people were in back slicing and dicing oblivious to the front. Finally I get my time consuming order 3 tacos. Lol. It's been carried around the kitchen, half forgotten on the grill.   Now it's time for checkout. Standing at the register for 5-10 min.. What appears to be a manager rolls past me to grab a drink at the soda machine. Starts chatting up the girl restocking the lids at the soda fountain who I later find out is my cashier.. After they joke around for awhile he rolls back past me and heads back to slicing and dicing in back.   Cashier finally comes up.. No sorry for waiting nothing.. Asks me what I had, I reply chicken tacos and ask for a drink. She runs my card, bags the food and walks away.. No have a nice day not a word.   I'm home now.. Live less than a mile away started writing after finishing 3 luke warm bland tacos.  Probably not going back. Until they upgrade their staff.    One more thing... Get rid of the singing.. It's demeaning to your staff. I'm sure they don't make a ton of money and to have them drone out some half hearted song about cheese or a new customer is revolting.  And really...after waiting for the length of time it would take to wrap up a meal at a fine dining restaurant.... Do you think my moods going to improve with the staff taking time out to sing?? It only perpetuates the situation. Putting a little more feeling behind the droning isn't going to be the solution either.  Definitely need to train your current staff to kick in when there's a wait or higher some new people. I'd get rid of whomever the manager was... Ridiculous!",

    "text": "2.4/5  - How can you make Mexican food without any flavor?  Ordered the BBQ pork burrito. Heard a lot about and read a lot of great reviews about this amazing BBQ pork. Turns out it is shredded pork with a very bland ketchup/honey sauce on it. I understand it's a chain and you aren't going to smoke the pork or anything that would add flavor during the cooking process but to skimp out and get the cheapest tasting BBQ sauce? Why even try? The other meat choices are shredded beef, shredded chicken, steak, and grilled chicken. The shredded beef didn't look too bad but the shredded chicken was sitting in a bunch of grey water and looked like it came out of a tuna can.   The employees screwed up my order a little bit, but I forgive them due to the environment they have to work in. When someone orders extra meat or cheese they all have to scream \"extra meat\" or \"macho man\" or something else incredibly obnoxious that I couldn't understand. You can see by their face they are miserable doing it and I don't understand who they are doing it for. Does a customer exist who takes great pride in everyone within earshot knowing the standard is just not enough for them? If the owner or manager of the restaurant is reading this review, KNOCK IT OFF! It's not funny, clever, or whatever else you think it is.   If you are looking for better quality Mexican food in the same price range first go to Baja Fresh (or Una Mas in the Bay Area), then Qdoba, then Chipotle.  On the way back I thought about whether there is any reason I would ever go back. The only thing I could come up with is if you really want BBQ and your wife really wants Mexican and you want to be nice and compromise and get a really crappy BBQ Burrito then maybe you go here.",

Besides the soup I also ordered a kid's quesadilla.  All seemed to be right in the world until I had a spoonful of soup and it was ICE COLD.  Do you know how long you need to keep a vat of hot soup off of a heat source for it to get cold? A really long time! Which tells me NO ONE was checking the temperatures of the food and no one bothered to notice the heat source wasn't on.  So after my first bite of cold soup, I took it up to the cashier and I got a deer in the headlights look. Like they were confused about needing to fix my problem.  I was asked if I wanted them to warm it up. Seriously? NO. Do you know what that's going to do to my avocado?  So they offered to make me a new one from scratch. I sat down and ate my kids quesadilla and my boyfriend wolfed down his burrito. Then I was done and bored and still hungry and I didn't have any soup.  So I went and asked for a refund. They assured me it would only be a few more minutes. At this point I had waited almost 10 min for new soup. No thank you.   What could have been a Rock My Socks sort of experience turned into me vowing to never come back here again. The food wasn't edible, the customer service was horrible and I can't trust a place that does not check the temperatures of their food since I have no desire to get food poisoning,",

No more meats available..and they've stopped cooking food for what seems like hours. Mind you this is 30 MINUTES before they close!! They act annoyed that you're there. Poor management!!

It includes rice beans two dressings lettuce and pico. If I do the right thing I would share but I love it so much that I dont. I don't even get rice but it still filling but I do add the fresh hot salsa instead of pico on top. They have daily specials and I think Friday is fish taco and I have yet to have that. I do remember having the enchiladas and loving it. Whether you get tacos burritos enchiladas they make the tortillas fresh in house heat it up right behind and melt the cheese on it before filling it up.  A little bit more expensive than Chipotle a great choice when you wanna mix it up. Handful of food places in this strip but parkin usually isnt an issue. Lotsa of hot sauces in bottles and all the drinks that are not soda are amazing. My favorite is the mint lemonade. Its got a mojito kinda vibe and no one would judge if you chose to throw a few plastic bottles of rum in there(once you get home of course :) )",

Look, I love Mexican food and yes I understand that RIo Cafe is the same concept as Chipotle and Qdoba, but according to my eyes and my taste buds, this place is waaaaaay better. And according to my wallet and my checking account waaaay more expensive too, almost double =S (hey nothing is perfect).   First of all the tortillas are AMAZING!, they are made right there in front of your eyes, all the ingredients and fresh, and they give you so much food! I confess that I am piggy, I eat A LOT, but when I go to Rio, I never finish a meal. My favorites are the salmon salad, the nachos (hey I'm a girl still growing up haha), and the tacos. I like the barbacoa, it's just that sweet kick in that pork that I love so much!   I have to make a confession: Yes, I agree, it is DELICIOSO to eat here, but a little too expensive for my budget, HOWEVER... I keep going back.... why?? Because they have the BEST Horchata I've ever had in my life and believe me, I have tried many horchatas in my life.... just sayin'. So go ahead!! Give it a try!!! Even if you don't want the food, go ahead and try that amazing Horchata, DELICIOSO!!  RIQUISIMO!! YUM! =)    Ps.- If you are on a diet, don't even drive near it! Even though everything is fresh, there are a lot of calories on those yummy tacos/enchiladas...even the salads. Read the nutritional facts menu before you order if you are being healthy conscious about what you eat. (see? I care people, I care...)",

And once the shock value wears off and you finally take a bite of your salad you will be in awe that you didn't pay half the price elsewhere for a better salad. The only thing that was enjoyable about the salad was the cilantro vinaigrette (which by the way when I asked for an extra side I was given two options. \"Do you want the $.50 or $1.00 extra?\" How about this is an $11.50 salad and an extra side of dressing is the lube before I get violated in exchange for some romaine lettuce?",

    "text": "Well, where do I start?  \"Let's start at the very beginning.  A very good place to start...\"  (Sound of Music, anyone?)   First of all, did anyone in this company compare what $7 will buy at say, a Cafe Rio and a...Chipoltle?   Because you can eat almost 2 times at Chipoltle for what you pay at Rio...and the two times you eat at Chipoltle is four times the amount of food at Rio.  What about flavor?  I don't know.  I had enchiladas.  I got the grilled chicken (vs the shredded chicken in water in the stream table) and that upgrade alone cost me $1 more.  What's up with that?  You don't pay anymore at Chipoltle for grilled chicken...anyway, I chose the \"medium\" sauce (\"medium heat\" or \"spice\", said the grill-man/manager and in fact, there was no heat at all)  because he said it \"...had the best flavor\".  It was good.  Not great.  Barely good.  Just not $10 worth of good.  Two chicken enchiladas, rice and beans, 9.86, I think and that's not with a drink, just the enchiladas..  Second, why is the place is called Cafe RIO?  \"Rio\", as in Rio de Janeiro..., right?  Let me ask you this: WHAT DOES RIO DE JANEIRO -- IN BRAZIL, MIND YOU, what does that have to do with Mexican food?  Rio de Janeiro is precisely 4761 miles or 7660.45 kilometers from Mexico City.  Wait, what?  Why not call McDonald's \"Hawaiian Hula Burgers\"?  Why not?  Because it makes no sense.  A lot like calling a Mexican restaurant Cafe Rio...just sayin'.  I ate next door at PotBelly a couple of times, good sandwich, but this Saturday, I just FELT like enchiladas and I thought it would be as good and cheaper than Arriba across the street.  I was wrong.  My order came out of the unfriendly Quizno-like toaster, and because the single line guy was busy, my hot enchiladas just sat there.  Then, when the single line guy DID have time to prep my order, the cashier simply HAD to speak with the manager, again, while my order just sat there.  Reminded me of the same kind of neglect I see EVERY SINGLE TIME AT The Habit.  Your order just sits there.  Any competent food person could figure out a system better than no system at all!  I cannot recommend this joint for anything.  And I've seen one in Tempe or Mesa.  Website is HORRIBLE.  Can't get a menu, near as I can tell.  Some guy's mug, all ego.  The free market is hard to predict, but I'll take Carolina's or Chipoltle on a bad day over this dump.",

I'm still hoping they open one near west gate.   Cafe Rio how I love thee, let me count the ways. I was first introduced to it by my boyfriend who went regularly in a different state and swore I would like it, even though I'm not a fan of Mexican (yes! I said it!) I ordered a chicken salad with pinto beans and all the fixings, extra cheese (shredded). As directed by my man I chose the tomatillo ranch dressing.   Taste buds delight!!! Fresh quality ingredients. No iceberg lettuce here! Great meat, and no fat/gristle like Chipotle loves to charge you premium prices for. Everything is delicious. I've been going to Cafe Rio now for 4 years and I'm still having a love affair with their salads. I keep meaning to try a burrito but I just can't pass up the crisp coolness of the romaine lettuce and cilantro. Mmmm.",

Their structure of how you build your entree is exactly like chipotle. I took my mom here for her bday today & my mother dislikes cheese because it hurts her stomach. She ordered 3 tacos & the lady immediately put cheese on them with the meat!!! SHE DIDNT EVEN ASK MY MOM! It was VERY RUDE!! Then, to top it off the lady gave her flour tortillas instead of corn like she asked in the beginning. Seeing as how she was on her lunch hour she settled for that. The food was great but the service here was TERRIBLE!! They really need to have their staff communicate better with the customers, the staff needs to listen to the customers and their requests. Not just make choices for them! I'm considering going back to eating at Chipotle and risking getting sick from Chipotle rather than going through Cafe Rios service again. It was that bad. Good-luck to anyone who goes here.",

The concept is phenomenal, and I admire the fact that there is plenty of options but the food lacks taste; It's simply bland! I must admit that I loved their corn tortillas and salsa, but the meat just doesn't cut it. If you are a True taco fan, you know the taco filing is key.   Overall, if you are looking for a great Mexican food experience, this is not the place. My opinion is subjective of course, so maybe I did not try the best thing on the menu, but the tacos are \"no bueno.\"   Tacos I ordered:  - Vegetarian - its just beans and rice and if you're vegan ask for no cheese  - Steak - is a $1.50 extra, the steak lacks flavor but is tender  - Pork Barbacoa - it's too sweet.. they should honestly rename it to BBQ pulled pork :) - Chicken Tinga - this was a little better, had more flavor when you added salsa",

Before you can finish all the tacos they're so soggy you can't even pick them up and eat them. They're really messy too, when you pick them up to eat them the liquid just pours out of it. It's really disappointing and this place can be pricey so i expect to not have soggy food. Their handmade tortillas are so good and the food tastes good but they ruin it by how they prepare it.",

This time was unacceptable though leaving me not able to finish my meal.   I come in frequently to the Gilbert location because it's near my work,so I know what sides and extras come with meals. At this location you need to ask if you want ANYTHING. They try to rush you through the line, and if you ask for anything the workers roll their eyes and are inconvenienced.   I was ordering for my family and didn't notice the missing items until I got back to my house. I did catch one thing in line. I ordered two tacos, and instead of asking if I wanted pico, she just started wrapping the tacos up. I asked for pico and she rolled her eyes and that's when I noticed the container was empty! She didn't want to walk back and get a new one! So instead she just decided I wasn't going to get any. I insisted and she went back and got me some.   I get home, with my tortilla soup, missing half the ingredients, and my two tacos and two tosadas. I take a bite from my taco, and pull a foot long black hair out of my mouth. Needless to say I didn't finish my meal, which brings their cleanliness into question considering when I was getting my beverage, the brewed tea dispensers were open to the world. Disgusting.   Management obviously needs to step it up at this location because if it's happening to me it's happening to others. And, after reading the reviews my complaints are the same as others and not being addressed.",

I work my ass off 7 days a week,  haven't taken a vacation in years and all I really do for myself is catch a movie now and then and eat out. And as it isn't financially accomadating to eat out all the time, you would figure for what you're paying for you could Expect a decent meal and proper customer service. Well, I'm telling you,  the manager who I've never seen smile,  and I've frequented this establishment quite regularly, must really be an unhappy person, and I would think a franchise as large as Cafe Rio would have customer service as a high priority as it should be  in all public facilities that are supposedly providing a service. Well, this particular Cafe Rio @Bell road and 9th street In Phoenix AZ has received my last visit. I would guess on average I have spent between $50 to $200 dollars a month there but no longer. Here's my issue, they serve a decent meal, plenty of ingredients and generally very nice, with the exception of this particular Manager Stephanie, every time I ask for a bit of extra cheese  and rice and the little thin tortilla chips it's like wtf dude, that is going to be extra! I don't  mind paying extra for something I've asked for, but Damn, a bit of rice, cheese, and tortilla strips really?! Ok charge me extra but you don't have to do it so rudely. Just had to vent, will not patronize this particular Cafe Rio ever again,  and I would suggest all others to follow my lead. If an establishment who is selling rice and beans for $10 -$14 Has to nickle & dime their frequent customers to an aggravating level of attitude, well imo they don't deserve being patronized.  So in general Cafe Rio, slack up on the extra this and that and service your customers. I can understand that you have overhead, but an extra spoonful of this a pinch of that, is it really necessary to drive business away? I would rather pay more totally for a product than to be nicked away at. Give your customer what they want, that is why you're in business. Make money but provide service.  Attitude does not belong behind the counter. Dino Homsey",

Portions good, enchilada style burro was tasty; however, I should have been told that I would be charged the same price for a cheese only quesadilla as a quesadilla with beef or chicken upon ordering not at checkout.  I paid $8 for a cheese crisp. Very pricey and not offered any options until it was too late.    But/for the cheese crisp issue, I would return.  Being treated dishonestly and hoodwinked leaves a bad taste.  No mas Cafe Rio.",

As I've read other reviews I have to agree that the employees lack the motivation to really push this review to a 5 star because the service is very much lacking. I would give lower but I don't think that's very fair when what I really honestly care about is the quality of what I'm eating - which is top notch but the employee culture is poor - which leads to customer dissatisfaction. Although I think that says more about management then the food line workers. It's managements job to encourage and put together an all star team and if any part isn't working then they should be aware enough to fix the problems. Problems such as opening up on time or closing down earlier and employee attitude are the biggest issues. Management needs to keep up with reviews and make the changes - this is a common occurrence.",

There's also a kids menu and some appetizers such as nachos or just chips and salsa. It's all order down the assembly line then pay. There was very few salsas to choose from and had trouble tasting the mild and medium salsas in the burrito. The highlight was the tortilla itself. There's just pinto or black beans but I like refried.. I chose grilled chicken which I regretted as I saw the employee put it on the burrito. Yes it's white meat but it was chopped fine and looked and tasted quite dry. The rice wasn't authentic which is fine but found the burrito to be bland. I tried a bite of my husband's burrito enchilada style topped w cheese and found enchilada style was a better idea. It gave the burrito more flavor. Their sauce isn't hot either and I believe that's the \"hot\" one. I personally like burritos w sour cream, pico and guac and more flavorful salsas. But mine had none of that.  It came w a side of lettuce and pico de gallo. I thought the pico de gallo was bland too. I didnt taste much citrus at all and seemed like the tomato and onion was stirred together then served..",

She saw us and went back to the kitchen to find someone and came back out still looking.  She never acknowledged us or mentioned that someone would be with us in a minute or anything.  We were about to leave until the manager walked out and began to prepare our meal.    He did wash his hands and on gloves which we appreciated but then said little to nothing as he prepared the meal.  No apology for a wait or for no staff being there at all.  He just went down the line and very sloppily put our burritos together with no care.  When we got our meal there was salsa spilling off the side of the bowls and no care was taken making our dish.  We then asked if they had keys for their bathrooms as they were both locked but he snapped back telling us no and that obviously someone else was in there.    We also noticed the place wasn't kept very clean.  The drink station was overly wet and sticky as if someone just dumped soda and ice all over the place.  The food prep station was humbled and had ingredients strewn about into other container like lettuce in salsa.    I determined that the food is overly sweet at both locations I've been too so that just be their recipes.  We both got steak burritos enchilada style and while not terrible, the off sweetness is just off putting.  I want spicy Mexican food not sugary.    I won't go back to this location at all.  Staff was rude and not attentive.  The manager (only staff not wearing a black t shirt) was very short with how he spoke to us and the other staff that eventually appeared were all joking around and goofing off when there was plenty of clean up that could've been done.  The food itself isn't terrible but something strange about it being so sweet.  I do appreciate that you can get things enchilada style where you can't do that at a chipotle or qdoba.  Considering there are plenty of restaurants in the same area, I would pass and find a better option.  2 stars and that's only because the food isn't inedible.",

My husband orders the sweet BBQ in burritos and loves it.  It doesn't cost extra for enchilada style which makes seem like you are in a sit down Mexican restaurant.  I would rather go here than any other Mexican restaurant hands down.  I also love the different drinks that they have there which you can't get anywhere else such as mint limeade and many other tasty drinks.  During lunch if you order ahead it's easy to just come and pick up your meals.  They even have a punch card so after you buy 10 meals you get one free.  I LOVE this place.",

Reminds me of when Chipotle started back in the day before they sold out. The grilled chicken is amazing and not rubbery like the rest. The grilled chicken salad, if done with the lime cilantro dressing, is simply the best I've ever had anywhere. I can't believe I just said that but it's True. Lets not even go over all the different drinks you can make at the drink station. They are all equally killer. As far as bad service others are talking about, I personally have had no issue. Yes it has the normal saturation of non English speakers that tends to confuse things a little, but this ain't Becketts Table either. These kids aren't getting rich throwing this stuff together for you and thankfully for us they took the job to serve us this great food. That's why we go. We are lazy and want to eat! No offense of course.  Anyway I think it's great and a welcome addition in the CenPho 'hood.",

I love that the Camelback corridor is blooming with new restaurants, but no need to go back to this one.  PRO's: The restaurant, cafeteria style, is extremely clean! Awesome! The menu, several options to the core styles of Mexican dishes (ie: burros, tacos, etc) Around $8 for a generous meal for one...not bad!  CON's: Service is slow.  Going through the line of 'fixings' takes a while. If you want lettuce in your burro, prepared to have it on the side.  They make your burrito with choice of meat, cheese, beans, then 'nuke' it in a conveyer belt toaster oven. (really)? I asked for lettuce in my burrito, and they said they put it on the side as to not send it through heater. Tortillas made there...but nothing to write home about  It's not a terrible place to go...just nothing worth having a frequent visitor punch card there. I would suggest Panchero's (exact SAME concept) over Cafe Rio.",

He stood there staring blocking our way until I finally said excuse me and went around him. The workers could see the whole thing!! I tell the worker the man was bothering us and pointed him out. By then the homeless man was at somebody's else table bothering them. The worker did nothing so I told him to get the manager. The manager didn't want to do anything either and tried to laugh it off. Finally she went and told him to leave a good 5 minutes later.  Then I got charged for 3 tacos instead of 2! The charge is almost $1 for extra cheese! They put the cheese on the bottom of the taco, I want cheese on top but not for an extra dollar per taco and a song that is sung when you order extra cheese.  On to the food.... The pork was dry and flavorless.. The barbacoa was sweet and I really don't want my tacos to taste sweet like candy. Overall I will not return or reccomend. If I want those types of tacos I will stick to chipotle.",

(The menu also listed guacamole as a vegetarian ingredient, but that was conspicuously absent from my burrito.) I specified \"enchilada style\" for my burrito, meaning that they coated my burrito with a hot sauce and melted cheese. Overall, my first experience was pretty favorable. The tortilla was fresh and, since heated to melt the cheese on top, soft and easy to cut. Together, the black beans and rice made for a great combination, but the \"enchilada style\" sauce, while mildly spiced, could have been a little spicier. If you are looking for an authentic Mexican culinary experience, Cafe Rio would probably not be on your short list, but the ingredients are fresh, the food is good, and the menu makes for very good Mexican fast-food. I would definitely go here again.",

It's very latin themed when you walk in, bright and cheery colors. I would describe it as a closer to authentic Chipotle. They have burritos, tacos, enchiladas, etc. and you make your meat selection and choose your sides. I had the taco combo with fire grilled chicken, rice, and beans. My mouth started watering as I saw them hand making the tortillas. I paid for our meals, stopped by the drinks and got some horchata (they're selection of jugos looked great), grabbed a seat and dug in. I really liked the tacos. I've never had Chipotle's tacos but these were a mix between street tacos and your taco bell fare, and I thought they were great. The rice and beans were okay. I wish there was one closer to where I live but I'll definitely return.",

    "text": "First off let me start by saying I love cafe rio but today was the worst experience I've had from any restaurant ever. The cashiers name is Jennifer. To start I ordered my food and everything went well. I paid for my 2 burritos 2 salads and 5 drinks. Then the cashier gave me my 5 cups and I told her I wanted large not the regular size. She had already rung me up so she got irritated because I said that. She said she couldn't charge me for the difference so I would have to get a refund and wait for my refund for two days on my card. I said that's fine. Then after she rung me up I got my receipt for the large cups but not for the refund. I asked for a copy of the refund receipt for my business card and she said she couldn't do it. I said I needed proof in case I didn't get my refund and she got mad and in Spanish told someone else \"atiendela tu\" with a annoyed voice like saying you deal with her. The other girl comes and gives me a receipt. I asked the girl that was clearly so annoyed her name and she said Jennifer and rolled her eyes. Then when I was filling up my drinks she proceeds to tell the other girl I'm Spanish \"estaba enojada la estupida\" - translation that b**ch was mad. And started saying other things but I already forgot because I got so angry. I said \"you need to stop being so rude\" then she walked all the way from the register and confronted me and said laughing \"what what am I said\" I said \"I know Spanish and you need to stop being so rude\". She got closer and said \"I'm not doing anything to you plus she's my manager\", laughed and walked away. I left and a customer followed me and told me to yelp it and contact corporate. I'm so irritated with how unprofessional and rude she was.",

    "text": "So let men start by saying the food is good at Cafe Rio. However, today when I went in for take out the customer service I received compelled me to write this review. While my order was being prepared the cashier and food preparer proceeded to talk across the customers about a party they were wanting to go to tonight, to the point that they couldn't talk and work at the same time delaying processing my order. Yes, not professional but I can let that slide, they're young. While I was driving home my order tipped over so I pulled over to make sure my order didn't spill out in my car. I noticed the tortillas I ordered on the side for my tacos were not in the bag. I drove back to get them. What comes next is mind blowing to me. When I walked in to ask for my tortillas, the cashier proceeded to tell me they were in the bag. She then called over to the food preparer that she was talking about going to the party with and asked him about the tortillas. He said that I would need to bring in the bag so that they could look through it. As if I'm lying to score two extra tortillas? I went back out to my car and brought in the bag. She went through the bag and saw no said tortillas. Instead of apologizing and getting me my tortillas, she proceeded to argue with me that she knows she put them in there and that they must be in my car. Seriously?!? She was defiant that she put them in there. It wasn't until I asked her \"why are you arguing with me over two tortillas.\" \"I am not lying to you to get two extra tortillas.\" \"Can you please get me two tortillas.\" She reluctantly asked the same food preparer to get me two tortillas. Apparently customer service is not a priority at Cafe Rio, but those tortillas that cost them pennies to make are. If management reads this and cares you can figure out the employees in question as I was there at approximately 2:30 on Saturday, October 29th.",

    "text": "I don't really see why I should choose this place over Del Taco or Taco Bell to be honest (let alone Chipotle or Fillie's). The staff would be the same (maybe better) and I'd get more food for almost the same quality. Watch out with their Taco Tuesday special. $1.75 for a small soft taco. If you get the \"tacos\", don't take the beans and rice or drink when they offer it or the special no longer applies and it jumps up to $6-$8 they don't let you know till you get to the register where they offer you a drink for a few dollars more like what happened with me. Leaves a bad taste in the mouth. But I went back anyway, not to be fooled again only to find out you can only get a limited amount of ingredients in the tacos for the special to apply. I don't think I could even get cheese on it. So I said whatever, paid my money and sat down to eat my limited tacos w/ no drink and suddenly the dining area seemed a little darker, the music a little louder and more irritating, and other diners with the same butt hurt looks on their face I probably had, and probably thinking, \"Why in the world did I come here?\" too.  Cafe Rio gets one star in my book for having a misleading/unclear menu, unhelpful and unfriendly employees, nickel and diming approach guised as specials, overcharging for small portions of food with limited ingredients, and charging extra for things that come standard every where else. Literally, the only positive I can say for this place is that some of the ingredients are fresh, but in the face of all those other factors and my experiences there it doesn't really matter and I won't be back. If I'm going to have Mexican food I'll just go to one of the other 6 or so Mexican places that come readily to mind, not to mention the other local, less marketed restaurants that I use yelp to find that that eclipse this place with their better service, food, prices, and atmosphere. For all those reasons, going here is just unthinkable to me.",

    "text": "Here in Phoenix finding a Mexican food joint is about as difficult as finding an UN-shaded parking spot. Being relatively new to the city, I haven't had the pleasure of having Mexican regularly at my disposal and at different levels of service/price/atmosphere etc. Cafe Rio sits nicely in a niche all it's own. First of all it's like a fiesta in there! The decor is festive and fun. It's usually BUSY!! Especially between 11:30am and 2pm and 5pm-7pm. It's kid friendly too so there are always tons of little frijoles jumping around making a racket so I generally take out.  The food is AWESOME!! It's all homemade and with bountiful portions! The have a different special everyday and all of their tortillas are make in-house. Everything comes smothered in your choice of delectable toppings: guacamole, cilantro, salsas, pntos, black beans, sour cream, cheeses... The drinks fountains include all the usual suspects as well as several house-made delights like mint-lime lemonade and traditional horchata, all bottomless! The salads are perfect for those carb-a-phobes like myself who just want greens protein and fat!  The service is cafateria-style, line up and get ready to order cuz it's fast and furious until you get to the till, kinda like Speedy Gonzales and Subway had a baby. The prices are decent and they even have a frequent-diner card that earns you freebies. Now I know many of the more traditional Mexican places in town are dirt cheap, but uh, the key word there is dirt...you get what you pay for and you get it in spades here! Perfect for anyone wanting something quick and deliciously nutritious. Eat in or take-out it's all good! They may not sell booze, but it's a culinary carnival just the same! Yo quiero Cafe Rio! Con muchos amor amigos! Hasta pronto!",

Everything was fresh and made from scratch each day.  He was very excited to tell us about all the great things and helped us figure out what we wanted to eat. We ordered the carnitas burrito with everything (they have fresh jalapenos) in it, including the enchilada sauce on top. It  was very filling, tasted fresh and had lots of flavors.  We also ordered the carnita tostada, with the whole wheat tostada.  It was more like a big salad, but it was pretty good.  I would get shredded beef next time because the carnitas did not blend well with the other flavors of the tostada taco.  Jim is right; the horchata is the best in town.  Would stop by just for that.",

Came here around 9pm (they close at 10pm) while the staff behind the line was helpful, it felt like they were programmed and since toward the end of the shift, they were just working in a robotic fashion. I wanted vegan so I asked if the rice is cooked with butter the response was \"yes\" so I asked for suggestions on what other vegan options they had, the staff member suggested beans and may be salad in my burrito. So I agreed, and here is where the robotic questions kick in (remember I informed the guy I want vegan) so after getting the bread and beans with no rice next question was \"what kind of meat?\" I said \"none, I need a vegan meal\" he acknowledged and moved on then asked \"cheese?\" I said no... it was funny though.   Drinks are sold and they give you cups and you fill it up yourself. I wanted iced tea and when I get to the fountains, they've cleaned up the iced tea dispensers so I'm stuck with soda or lemonade, if I had known there was no iced tea, I would have gotten a cup of water. Oh and all the iced tea tubs were in front of the fountains for the soda so it was a challenge to even get a drink.   Food was average, nothing special. And oh, someone decided to clean the iced tea dispenser first, but left the trash super full, so when we left and after picking up after ourselves, the bin was so full, we had to place our plates so carefully so it wouldn't fall.   Any how, I tried it, it was not the most pleasant experience and now I know, and you know!",

Cafe Rio is an excellent Mexican Grille, that's quick, however Cafe Rio doesn't skimp on the big bold flavor. I prefer to get the taco salad with the pork barbacoa or green chili beef.  Make sure you try the house cilantro lime ranch dressing, a wonderful compliments for your salad.  Homemade tortillas, daily specials and fun atmosphere add up to a great place to eat.

Our food was made to order quickly but something was holding up the checkout process. Their only vegetarian option was simply doubling the amount of rice and beans in the burrito so for a vegetarian I would not recommend this place as a first stop.",

The most I could get out of them was a finger pointing to an unmanned cash register. I stated I was there to pick up an order, and he replied \"You'll have to talk to her when she gets back\". \"She\" finally arrived and cashed out some other orders for people eating in the store before acknowledging I was there. I told her I was picking up a to-go order and gave her my name. She was unable to find my order and spent the next few minutes trying in vain to find it on the computer. The place was so disorganized, I will never attempt this again, nor will I eat food prepared here. Thoroughly disgusted, I walked out.",

    "text": "I will say the food here is tasty, however they have a confusing menu - the photos don't match how they actually make that item - as in if you order a salad it comes out like taco but if you order the taco bowl it comes out like a salad.  Also depending on who is working they'll either give you a little dressing and charge you $1 for extra or they'll give you enough dressing you don't need to order extra.  That being said the reason I give them 2 stars, is because I was suppose to meet a friend here tonight and I actually argued in favor for this place and he drives the 25 minutes to meet me here and the place is closed - it looks like they may be having a family event but if you're making your place look like a legitimate fast food or sit-down restaurant, you can't just randomly close the place - you should put warning a week a head or just wait to do the party after hours.  If this was an employee event most places will just take the staff to another restaurant so they don't have to close their place of business and inconvenience customers.  So not only did you lose my business tonight because you were closed, you most likely lost 80% of my business as I won't ever be able to rely that you'll be open when I show up so if I come in it will be by a small chance.  I hope you learn from this.",

The girl who I spoke to on the phone told me the guac was brown because the avocados they've been getting are overripe. I didn't find this acceptable and let her know. She then proceeded to tell me that they mixed in salsa Fresca that also could have changed the color of the guacamole. I didn't find this to be acceptable either, was transferred to the manager whom I had the same conversation with as the first person I spoke to. He offered me a free meal since I was unable to go back for a refund due to my work scheduled. He never uploaded the free meal to my account like he said he would. I was unable to eat lunch due to the spoiled guacamole on my salad and only having a 30 minute lunch break.",

I move back to Phoenix a few years back and was so excited when they opened a Cafe Rio here. They are pretty close to my house so a few times a week I would be here and in the beginning quality was good but slowly and surely it has become a place I might go to once a month in hopes that it has gotten better. Today might be my last day here, this place has really hit a low. Is there ever even a manager here? I'm sitting here and the place is dead! Yet there isn't a clean table in the entire place, something I've noticed my last few visits. nobody is doing anything. The strawberry lemonade and horchata I used to love are now completely watered down and no longer the yummy drinks I loved. The food is mediocre at best. This is sad.

Went around 9:15 at night still 45min before closing. There are 6 people behind the counter doing work, except actually helping us out. Finally one of them decides to help us (there are two of us no one else in line) Was about the slowest process I've ever seen in my life. took us over 15 min to get through. Part of the problem was NO ONE was helping him. I asked a question about the desserts (as he was making my food) so he had to stop what he was doiong ask, go get someone, etc ... instead of her just taking the initiative.  So Service was SLOWWW.  Food was OK, above a taco bell but does that really say much?  I asked if i could have black beans with my quesadilla, apparently it doesnt come with it and I can't have that. We also bought a burrito and apparently hot sauce is an extra cost, really hot sauce?  Anyways this was my 3rd time and last time there.",

    "text": "To paraphrase Woody Allen, \"Such bad food, and such small portions\".  Like Chipotale/Qdobe/America's Taco Shop but not as good.  The good: Fresh tortillas  The bad: Everything else.   Service was bizarre. Weird combination of personalized, non-personalized and uncaring. I asked for my burrito as dry as possible and they made it sopping wet. Literally dripping out the tortilla in multiple places so I had to knife-and-fork it. Pork barbacoa was unique and sounded great but was not very good -- waaaay too sweet. Going down the service line, they asked me what kind of salsa I wanted (\"none, thanks\") and proceeded to dump a bunch of cheese inside my burrito without asking:   \"Um, I'm sorry, but I didn't ask for cheese and can't have any\" \"We put cheese in every burrito\" \"You asked me what kind of menu item I wanted, what kind or rice, what kind of beans and what kind of meat, but you just put loads of cheese on everything without asking?\" *Rolls eyes and remakes burrito and begins to fold it* \"Excuse me, can I get lettuce in it?\" \"It goes in the oven, so we don't put it inside (places in oven), you get lettuce on the side\" \"But.......\"  So I can't have what I want or the way I want it. Got it.  To boot, a relatively small portion and about $1 more expensive than Chipotle/Qdoba, etc.  No thanks. I'll go anywhere else.",

The tortillas may be homemade but I can get tortillas just as good or better at other Mexican food establishments.  I had asked if I could get cheese on the top of the tacos, it would've cost extra.  You got to be kidding me!  The lettuce was poorly cut, huge pieces that makes it hard to eat it in a taco or even a salad.  Really messy prep area and the staff pretty much lazy about how they prepared the tacos and other guests meals.  People were not that friendly nor seemed to like their jobs.  Good location to be in, yet not worth the trip.",

Every time, I'm very careful to ask questions about ingredients because I cannot have dairy or gluten. I've been assured multiple times that I can have the corn tortillas, lime cilantro dressing, beans, rice, etc. I have other health issues so I've felt generally bad for a long time...I couldn't really tell if a certain food or restaurant was causing the reaction. Before ordering tonight, I looked online at their allergen menu and EVERYTHING I have eaten here in the past has either gluten, dairy, or both. Their corn tortillas, rice, beans, dressings, chicken...literally everything I have ordered has an allergen and I have specifically asked and been assured by a worker that the food doesn't contain allergens. I am so angry and disappointed. The only thing I would be able to eat here is the crunchy corn tortilla, chips, and pico.",

I don't  eat meat and there are many meatless options here alone with many meat options. Chicken grilled, shreaded, pork, beef. I can account for them being any good but my boyfriend and son both enjoy the chicken. I come here about once a week. If say my only complaint is they are usually not very friendly. Sometimes after a long morning a work a friendly fave or attitude at your lunch spot can turn your day around. So would be nice to see smiles and some vetter service but the food is something I'll come back for even if the service isn't up to par..",

I come here literally two nights a week, I would put up with the poor service because the food is so tasty and easy. Well last night really blew it. The guy wouldn't even look at me, gave me bite size portions of beans, rice, and meat in my salad. After working a 13 hour shift and not eating the entire time, I am famished, and let me say, this girl can put it down and I don't mess around. His attitude was TERRIBLE and when I asked for salad dressing, HELLO! it's a salad I was blatantly ignored. Another customer asked him what was included on her entree and his response was, \"you can have whatever you want! I am about to walk right on out of here!\" So both her and I spoke with the manager and all we were offered a was an apology. Not to mention, every time I come here, no matter the time, they are already gearing up to leave for the night; The food is set out and the grill is moved for cleanup. Who knows if the food is even being held at the proper temp, this could be a food safety concern as well.",

Today, I asked for a side of guacamole since it is on the menu. The lady serving me asked if I wanted it on the burrito and I said no. Then she put my burrito to the side and continued helping the people behind me. I also told the cashier I had asked for a side of guac so she called out for it. The first lady walked over to her coworker and both were looking at me like I'm asking for something crazy. She finally said they don't have any and looked away. Just poor customer service.

Not only was my food cold, but it was terribly assembled, my chicken enchilada had barely anything inside of it and half the order was missing. I guess it's part my fault for not checking while there, but you just trust that they're going to make it correctly. :(  Sad state of affairs - lost a lot of respect for Cafe Rio today. It seems they pay even less attention to guests' online orders than they do to guests who are ordering in-store. :(",

This place fulfills my need for options in a way that their competitors can't.  The menu is a little confusing, and the daily specials board doesn't have prices or explain that it includes a drink.  I had the special, the chicken tostada salad, a tostada with rice and beans, piled with romaine, chicken, pico de gallo, a dollop of sour cream, tortilla strips, and some dressing that tasted EXACTLY like the jalapeno ranch I covered everything with at Chuy's when I lived in Texas.   I also ordered chips and queso, which came with a pretty good salsa and more pico.  Drinks! Vanilla coke! Horchata! Tea and lemonade! (See what I mean about options?)  Everything is served in foil \"to-go\" containers, with lids on the condiment bar for easy transport.  Next time I go I think I'll try one of the tortillas they seem so proud of.   Oh, and visit their website and click \"I don't care\" down toward the bottom. You'll thank me.",

Maybe if this bean burrito were exceptionally good or large in size, but it was neither.  I'm not saying that if your idea of Mexican food is Chipolte, you will not find what you are looking for and be happy here. But if what you offer your vegetarian customers is deleting the meat and not adding anything else and charging full price, I can get MUCH BETTER elsewhere and pay way less.    GRINGOS:  Take off the Chipolte blindfolds!  Go to a real Mexican restaurant and see what real food is supposed to taste like!",

What I noticed behind the counter was a lot of confusion among way too many high school employees.  It looked like they opened last week, yet they opened at least 6 months ago.  I used CRMG online ordering tool.  That worked.  I ordered the beef nachos and a beef burrito.  When I dug into my nacho's I didn't like that there was barely any cheese.  Also, they seem to use cheddar which once it cools changes your nachos to NACHO.  Impossible to separate.  I gave up on the nachos quickly - no flavor and a pain to eat.  Time for the burrito.  What the burrito lacked in flavor, it made up for in size.  What flavor was there, was not what I expected.  I ordered with a medium verde salsa - which it appeared to have - but it also had some kind of enchilada sauce.  The two combined to be inedible.  I ate less than 20% of the burrito before trashcanning it.  All in all, it was a wasted $18.50  Under no circumstances can I envision a return.",

I come in and I explained to the lady my order might be complicated I would like my chips in a separate box then all my topping because by the time I get home my chips are soggy. I live about an hour away from the nearest cafe rio. Well I guess she couldn't understand what I was saying so she got an attitude just started throwing any kind of topping she wanted in there because she didn't give me the ones I asked for. At the end she threw my food at me and told the cashier \"to just put my shit in a bag\". When I say she threw my food at me I mean threw it at me my food slid onto the counter tipped over and everything, it just went everywhere. I was outraged, first I drove 1 hour to get to the establishment to pay almost $20 for a meal that was thrown at me and half of it to be spilled on the counter and floor. I asked to speak to a manager and she did nothing made me pay for the food and I left. later when I called and asked to speak to corporate then she wanted to be like I'll give you a coupon to come back and see us. No thank you I want to speak to corporate. Terrible customer service, absolute worst. Will never see another dime of my money.",

They also have a really festive array of drinks. Your typical soda machine of course, but off to the side is about 4 cooler of fun mixes. There's mint lemonade, Mexican limeade, and 2 others. All made in house and totally authentic.   They are making their claim to fame with the torillas though. I would recommend this place to just go and eat their bread all day.",

The burrito was not enchilada style or the correct ingredients,  the chicken tortilla soup was just broth no chicken cheese etc, the side of lime and tortilla had the lime covered in the strips so they were soggy, and the chips and salsa were missing.   We thought perhaps we ordered incorrectly so we looked at the included detail receipt and it showed what we ordered not what we received.  Had it been just one or two things we'd probably not bother but we called to see about getting the correct items.   The woman who answered was rather rude, doubting the order was wrong,  finally begrudgingly said she'd remake the burrito and soup but insisted the chips weren't missing.

    "text": "I have given cafe Rio so many tries. Everyone seems to love it there, but I haven't had such luck. One thing that has remained consistent in my experience is there is NO flavor to any of the food. I went here again today so very excited to try the \"spicy green chile habanero pork.\" Something spicy! I was so excited! After being skipped in line (not a huge deal) I ordered my food. Upon receiving it, it smelled sweet, like a donut. I tried it anyway. There wasn't a whole lot of meat and the meat wasn't drained very well so the crispy quesadilla was more of a soggy mess. After navigating around the soggy mess I finally got a few choice bites and it was sweet! I looked at my receipt to make sure I ordered the spicy pork and not the sweet \"barbacoa,\" my receipt indicated I had ordered correctly so I took it up to trouble shoot. The women i spoke with, I recognized as the person who skipped over me in line initially. I voiced my concern, \"the receipt doesn't mean anything,\" she said. I proceeded to explain to her that I was certain I ordered the spicy pork. She then took my fork and dug into my food and replied \"this is the spicy pork, see the green chile?\" At this point I was convinced my opinion as a customer didn't matter. I threw my food away and sat down. Then I went back up to ask what the manager's name was and a different employee said she would send her over. The manager was nicer but didn't seem to care that I was unhappy with my food but even more unhappy with the lack of customer service I received from her employee. She told me that the same pork was used for both dishes, that they don't make anything spicy there because if there are two serranos in the regular salsa customers will complain that it is too spicy. I guess if I want Mexican food with flavor, I need to get it elsewhere because this food is flavorless and the company doesn't seem to want to keep their business. My reason for writing this today is to warn their False advertising- nothing is spicy there and the lemonades are labeled as tangy, they are not, they are overly sweet too. I like sweet for dessert, not in my main course.",

    "text": "Have you ever had a meal that leaves you equal parts full and unsatisfied? It happens to me all the time.   Here's the deal: When most people are starving they'll eat anything right?  Like, \"Is there peanut butter or maybe some triscuits in the cupboard. Oh good, I'm starving. I'll eat those.\"   I'm the opposite.  A very common exchange in my life is:  Me: I'm staaaaarving.   Someone (slightly) more rational than I am: Um, there's a kitchen full of food right there. Me: No, I'm starving! I need something really good! I can't waste this!  Yes, that's right. I don't like to \"waste\" hunger.  And that is exactly what I feel like I did at Cafe Rio.  After reaching full-on STARVATION MODE one Tuesday Night, I set my sights on Taco Tuesday and began to research.  Yes, this is how seriously I take my bouts of hunger. It involves research.  After reading Yelp it appeared that both Cafe Rio and Rubio's had $1.50 tacos but Cafe Rio was a couple miles closer and Rubio's only had fish tacos on special so we opted for Rio.  Upon walking up to the entrance, we realized were surrounded by children, which was curious. The place seemed like Chipotle-esque fast casual Mexican. Certainly kid friendly but it's not like there was a damn play place involved. We felt like we were at a day care. It was extremely confusing.    So we get in line and have no idea what the hell is going on. It's hard to tell if they are an \"order-off-the-menu\" place or a \"walk down the line and pick what you want you want\" place. So I just shout three different types of meat at the guy behind the counter and hope for the best.  Finally, it appears like I've reached the portion of the line where I will be dressing my tacos.   \"Do you want lettuce and pico de gallo\" \"Yes please\"  No other questions followed.  I saw cheese. I saw beans. I saw rice.  Were any of these offered to me? No.  Finally when it became clear this was not a \"point and get\" situation, I asked the guy behind the counter if they had a hot salsa.  \"We have our Salsa Fresca, it's the hottest we have, and it's FREE!\"  Um, yes I would assume it's free considering you are a MEXICAN RESTAURANT and it is a side of SALSA.   Lance and I both got 3 tacos, I got an iced tea, and our bill was $16.23.  Now, I wasn't a math major, but that doesn't sound like $1.50 tacos to me. Turns out only one of the tacos we got was on special ($1.75, actually, though I did get my $1.50 number from Yelp so that's not their fault).  Grilled chicken and steak were not on special. All of the sudden, Rubio's started sounding really good.  We chose a corner table and proceeded to feed our starvation (did I mention that we were STARVING) while some Adderall-ridden 5 year old danced about 3 feet away from us.  Yes, I said dance. Girl was jumping up and down like she was at a damn Ke$ha concert with absolutely no regard for the people around her, which was probably just as well because we were too busy stuffing our faces with dry chicken, diced tomatoes posing as pico-de-gallo, and lettuce.  One thing I will say is the tortillas were delicious.  We go to leave and see a sign by the register: Children 6 and Under Get a Free Quesadilla.  Aha, mystery solved.  Probably the most satisfying part of our visit.  Moral of the story: There's a Chipotle across the street.  There's a Rubio's two miles away.  There's probably freaking peanut butter and Triscuits in your cabinet.  All of these would be better options than wasting your hunger on this place. Unless you're under 6 in which case, quesadilla party at Cafe Rio.",

The girl seemed very irritated that she had to come help me. I almost walked out and left the food. I will not be going back here.",

I ordered the Sweet Pork Barbacoa Burrito (pictured) and found the title to be spot on. I was a bit put off by the sweetness of it, finding the sauce to taste like an extra sweet BBQ sauce. It completely overpowered the flavor of the meat. The pico de gallo topping would have been just average, but I must say the diced tomatoes were ripe and tasted just off the vine.  Be aware, the acoustics of the restaurant and the music over speakers make for a loud environment. I couldn't even hear the employees' questions!  There are so many dining options in the area that I'm not sure I'll return. If I do, I'll steer clear of the sweet sauce, but give the yummy raspberry lemonade another swig!",

They act as though you are bothering them being there!  I can't believe how much slower they are now without the originals there.  I will give props to the Same great food and our sweet lady who works both in dining room as well as in the back... restocking the food! Hey name falling me now,  but she is the BEST!

If you stand in line and order at the restaurant, you are likely to get a great meal since everything is done right in front of you. However you will also be in queue for 20-30 minutes + during the lunch rush. I've taken to ordering ahead, but nearly every time my online order experience has been poor. Once, the tortillas were barely cooked and gummy, like they had a bad batch and decided to pawn them off on to-go orders. Once the order was 15 minutes late, once I got the wrong meal entirely etc etc. I would give the food four stars when it's on point, but the service gets one or two stars at best for consistency problems.",

As you walk into the line, you can see that the tortillas were being made fresh. Big plus!   I ordered the burrito with the chile roast beef, black beans, rice and medium sauce. Then decided to make it enchilada style with the hot sauce. It was a huge portion. I also ordered a mint limeade.   The burrito was good but way more rice and beans than meat. The red (hot) sauce on top also had a sweet component I wasn't fond of. The limeade was refreshing.   Overall, I enjoyed it and live really close so I will definitely be back. I feel like there is a flavor combination that will really seal the deal for me. I just have to go back til I find it!",

They had a taco special for Taco Tuesday and they were each a very generous portion, served with homemade tortillas being rolled and warmed right in front of you :) It was a nice change from Chipotle. I got the bbq pork barbacoa and a side of beans. The beans were kind of slopped to the side and spread all over the plate and foil, but they gave me a large amount, so it didn't matter too much. We also shared an appetizer of guac and salsas, which was huge.  It included drinks and we only paid about $20~ Everything tasted very fresh and we are anticipating the Scottsdale location!  P.S They have horchata",

    "text": "My feelings about Cafe Rio turned dubious when I saw prices higher than Chipotle or Qdoba, with fewer meat choices (no carnitas!). The dubiousness doubled down when  I got a look at the fixings.  It was a long look, as the large staff seemed utterly uninclined to wait on me. After a long while, one gal pointed me out to another, who smiled at her coworker and went back to whatever she was doing with the grill. At this point, I gave up and left.  The idea that checking off store tasks is way more important than waiting on customers probably comes from management, so I'm not going to blame the very young and probably inexperienced staff. But if it's your business model to figure that customers can damned well wait until somebody gets around to them and there's no hurry or need to even acknowledge them waiting, then you'd best be either way cheaper or way better quality than your competition. There is no reason I'd give Cafe Rio a second chance.  I went to one of the other restaurants in the same strip and had a very nice experience there.",

Tips on ordering, I love the sweet pork. its good in a burrito, in a salad etc. I know my friends like the green chile beef which is also good. You know what is great? The fact that they have taco tuesday for 1.50 tacos. Umm wow. you cant get the steak though, its not on the deal. but get one of everything if you can fit it in ya!

    "text": "If I could this place zero stars I would. I used to go to the cafe rio place in vegas and it was great now come to this location its terrible. I have been here a few times and each time customer service is worse. I went out of town for almost a year and its gotten worse. Its more expensive and quality is not up to par. When I walked in they were cleaning with 1 hr left till closing. I stood there for 5mins for someone to notice that I was waiting to be served finally someone came. He was very blunt and non chalant almost like I was bothering him. He didn't offer me any condiments either until I noticed I didn't have any at the cashier.  The cashier was just as awful as well. He didn't even hand me my receipt or change. I really love the cafe rio franchise but this location makes it difficult to be loyal. Good luck",

    "text": "This place is an exact imitation of chipotle but a lot worse. After waiting 40 minutes in line the place was out of steak during the middle of the day on a Saturday. Employees were rude and tried to rush everyone with their orders. The least they could have done is inform everyone that they were out of a certain ingredient to avoid waiting in line.   I ordered a burrito with chicken. The burrito barely had any meat in it and was overflowing with rice and beans. I was disgusted when I had seen their whole batch of guacamole was dark brown so I opted not to have it. The restaurant was also out of coke and their sprite tasted like water. Worst experience at a Mexican place and most definitely never coming here again. Go to chipotle trust me you'll be a lot more satisfied than eating at this place.",

    "text": "I never thought I would be writing this review.... I fell in love with cafe rio while vacationing in Utah. I was THRILLED when I had one of my very own right down the road!!  Because I loved their food so much, I've given this place many chances. Tonight was the last straw. Hoping for a quick queso snack, I waited in a long line. The employee then started dishing out queso from a dish that had been sitting on the back counter, and trying to get enough out of the bottom. GROSS! I was somewhat relieved when she spilled that cup, only to be quickly disappointed that she did not offer to make a fresh batch. She just said they were out and asked if I wanted anything else. Ummm no. Too much inconsistency and bad service, sad to say I won't be back.",
