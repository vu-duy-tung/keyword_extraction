The salad was crisp romaine with cucumbers, tomatoes, and just enough red onion to lend flavor.  There was a generous amount of feta; lots of flavor for little fat.  Only one kalamata olive, though.  The place has an unassuming diner atmosphere, and a drive through window.  The staff were efficient and friendly.  They lost a star for the single olive and Coke products (\"No Coke.  Pepsi!)\"",

The service is the best though. Everyone working there is incredibly friendly.  In fact, on one recent trip through the drive through, they forgot to put tzaziki sauce in the bag.  When we called them, they offered to drive over 2 sides of the sauce to our house.  I was so impressed!  They also have a really nice patio.",

    "text": "My husband and I come from a place where, literally, we ate out at Greek restaurants 4 nights a week. It would have been every night if I'd had my choice, but my husband requires variety when it comes to food. So we had our four favorite Greek spots that knew us by name, and the other 3 nights he got to choose where we dined and I had Greek for lunch instead of dinner.   In March, we relocated to AZ and our food choices haven't been the same since. We've tried almost every Greek restaurant imaginable around us with nothing but disappointment when it comes to the food. So far, Pita Jungle is a big favorite of mine, and we do get take out once a week from different Pita Jungle locations, but it's still different and nothing has been even remotely comparable to the Greek food back home.   A coworker stopped by Z's Greek the other day for lunch. I'd never heard of it but, still on my quest for good Greek food, asked if he'd just pick me up a chicken pita. He came back with a chicken pita of pure perfection! It was on a super fresh pita, the chicken was seasoned perfectly, the veggies were fresh and the tzaziki sauce was delicious! Much to my delight, it also came with a small Greek salad (also perfect--fresh veggies, a large helping of feta and probably the best Greek dressing I've ever tasted!), and a drink all for around $8!  I loved it so much I decided to pick it up on my way home for dinner that same day! I will say my coworker should have warned me a bit on the location, it was nothing as I expected. The inside was a bit run down, the restaurant only had 2 tables of customers but many of the empty tables needed to be cleaned. The employees were very nice and the memory of that fabulous lunch made me go ahead and stick around to order dinner. I ordered 2 large Greek salads with chicken for my husband and me. They came with sides of pita bread and tzaziki sauce. My husband was just as impressed as I was with the place and the salads were too big for either of us to finish!    We'll definitely be frequenting this place. I feel like I should be giving them 4 stars due to the dirty tables (I'm a bit of a germ freak), but the food is too good to subtract any points. I'll assume they had just had a HUGE rush and I came in before they had time to straighten the dining area back up. Plus, there's a drive through. I can skip the dining room in the future!",

From my experience I give this restaurant an overall four stars derived by their Greek styled atmosphere, great food selection, and customer satisfaction! Z's is a family friendly zone which is good for all ages from kids to adults. There is barely any waiting line plus, the food is dished out quick. Best of all, there is a drive through window which allows easier pickup especially on the go. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who has never experienced Greek food and is willing to taste a different styled recipe from their original comfort zone. Everything is prepared tenderly, juicy, and well seasoned! Give Z's Greek a try!",

The kicker however was their loaded cheese fries with cheddar and feta. I made my wife a believer in feta by giving her a bite of these fries. They are the real deal!

Service wasn't their best, felt ignored.  I didn't get a receipt, so I just ate some of it and threw the rest away.  Which is a really big waste for me spending $17.    I know for a fact how awesome they truly are.  They've given me nothing but great service and great food all the last times I've been there.  I brought someone along with me this time and told them how great it was, and my favorite Greek joint let me down this ONE time.

We tried the lamb and chicken souvlaki, both of which came with seasoned rice, roasted potatoes, a Greek side salad and grilled pita. A lot of food for the money, and all well done. The salad had tomatoes, cucumber, and kalamata olives and was covered in feta. Definitely not the lame afterthought salad you get at some places. Two good-sized skewers of souvlaki, and delicious sides. I will definitely be back - especially since I am still searching for the Valley's best falafel.",

We moved to the neighborhood about 6 months ago and have been here several, several times because it is a) delicious, b) convenient, and c) super reasonable in price. I think between my boyfriend and I, we have tried most of the menu, and have not been disappointed yet. I do have to admit that I do not eat actual gyros (lamb, nope, no way, will never eat it), but the BF does and loves them here. For me it's usually a toss-up between the chicken breast pita and the mousaka. Both are huge and filling and sooo good. The pita comes with Greek salad or fries (both are awesome, and their salad dressing and cheese is my favorite anywhere), and the mousaka comes with rice. lemon potatoes, and Greek salad. (The lemon potatoes are to die for, FYI). I frequently end up ordering something sweet to take home as well, and their tiramisu is really good. You basically can't go wrong ordering anything here, it is all fantastic! Staff are all really nice and we have never had any issues with wrong orders, cold food, anything you might expect to experience once in a while. We love it!",

It was so good the first time I had to go back the next day and get a steak sandwich again with a Greek salad, however this time I also added baklava which was delicious. You've got to go to Z's if you're going to go Greek.",

    "text": "Delicious! I first tried Z's Greek at work for a catered meeting. I've always wanted to try it with my husband fresh in the restaurant.   My husband and I both got a platter with souvlaki chicken and lamb. The platter had rice, a Greek salad, roasted red potatoes and a pita bread. We also ordered hummus & feta and olives. We wanted to try out some fries so we ordered a side of fries as well (which was a big basket). Everything we tried was fresh and when our platters came out they were beautiful (sorry I didn't get a picture).   If you want fresh grilled chicken or the lamb kebabs come order these and you won't be disappointed. We also added some cheesecake (which was a very big piece) it was delicious. We ended up taking a bag home with basically one of the dinners and some of the cheese and the fries because it was so much food and also half of the cheesecake. The chicken skewers and also the Lambs here's can be purchased for $3.50 by themselves this would be a great thing to pick up through their drive-thru and add to your salad for dinner. I strongly recommend you trying out this family-owned business that's been around for 10 years I support local businesses over commercial any day.",

    "text": "I sure do love me some Greek food folks so had to check out Z's one night. It's a casual place which was perfect as my gf and I had gone out on a hike and weren't the most \"presentable\". We arrived around 5ish on a weekday and there were just a couple tables present with customers but within 15min that changed rather quickly. We saw numerous patrons come place their orders and take it to go or dine in. This place is rockin! You know what else is rockin? Their staff, it was just 2 girls up front and I noticed they were super quick to go into the dining room and clean up some tables just as soon as customers left. They were a perfect team! Usually in fast casual establishments like this, staff can at times be pretty lazy about stuff like this but not here. OK, on to the food.......First, the portions are HUGE, Fresh and Delightful! I ordered the falafel pita with everything, it was awesome because I'm actually not big on fried stuff too much but this falafel did not taste greasy at all, it was just perfection in my mouth. My gf got the gyro platter and it was nuts how big this thing was. You get a ton of meat, veggies, pita, just everything. It was really nice looking too. We had started off with the hummus which was excellent and definitely tasted homemade. Overall, I'd be stupid if I didn't come back here again. Dine in, or take out you can't go wrong with Z's Greek. I did not take photos because I was hangry when I arrived. Just take my word for it, they are legit!",

    "text": "I came here with co-workers and was instantly hooked. I usually get the falafel pita (I add hummus; no tomatoes) with fries. You can get it as a combo, which comes with a drink, for less than $9. The falafel is always perfectly crisp & tasty. Their pita bread is always so very fresh; always. Like, seriously; they never have an off day. Their hummus is a yummy traditional flavor with a light olive oil.  That heavenly pita bread, spread with hummus, encompassing 3-4 crunchy falafel balls, with cool lettuce and fresh cut onions = triumphant flavor explosion in my mouth. I close my eyes and go, \"ommmmm\" with each bite. And the french fries? OMG. Made to order, so they're fresh, hot, & crispy every time, and coated with a delicious seasoning. Simply irresistible. No diet is safe!  If you go with friends, split a side order of fries. You'll get a huge heap for only $2.  My meat-eating friend is in love with their Caesar salad w/ grilled chicken. She says the chicken is amazing & seasoned to perfection.   There are a decent number of tables inside, some Mediterranean decor, and TVs. They have self-serve fountain drinks as well as bottled water. There are Sriracha bottles scattered about for your spicy-dosing pleasure. They also have an outside covered patio with several tables. I love the patio during non-summer months. We come during the lunch rush and the service is always pretty fast. When we're rushing or just being lazy, their convenient drive-thru saves the day.  The parking lot can get very busy though, and sometimes there's a tight squeeze between the parked cars & the drive-thru, so be cautious with your vehicle.   Z's Greek is an awesome lunch or dinner spot for veg*ns & omnivores. Consistently amazing food. Best falafel in the Valley, hands down.",

I'm actually rounding up from a 3.5 rating since I'm in a good mood... but if you're in the mood for Greek, I recommend trying this place; especially if you don't care much about atmosphere.    The place itself feels a bit like a fast food restaurant.  It's a fast casual concept where you order at the counter and they bring your food to you.  They also check-in to make sure everything is ok; extremely friendly staff.  We shared a hummus appetizer and I had a large Greek Salad with chicken.  Christina went for a falafel pita.  Their pita is fresh and moist and I ate more than my share of it... the hummus is good too but maybe missing a little something.  My salad was perfectly dressed and came with lots of chicken.  The chicken wasn't the best I've had but I'm extremely picky when it comes to chicken; i ate most of it anyways.  The prices are extremely reasonable.  The reason I am rounding up my rating?  WiFi and drive through... yes, they have a working drive through and I can guarantee I will be taking advantage of that sometime soon!  I will be back; nice to have another solid Greek restaurant in my 'hood!",

He has been a couple times, since he used to work in the area and was super happy to take me here for the first time.  My first impressions were good, the place is open and spacious and we were greeted with a smile, which is always a plus.  The young lady taking our order answered all our questions and went above and beyond to make sure our food was made correctly.  The food, as you can see from the many reviews, is great.  Obviously fresh, and obviously made with love and attention.  We both had the chicken pita combo.  I had the salad, which was loaded with lots of feta and fresh veggies.  It did take awhile to get our food, which I know is out of the norm (according to my Husband).  Since we were in no hurry, we didn't really mind.  I loved the sauce sauce and the pita itself.  Everything was fabulous... I only wish this place was closer to my house... perhaps they should open another one new desert ridge... just a suggestion.  All I can say is YUM and GO.",

The best way to sum up my experience was that the food was ok. I got the gyro combo with a side salad. The salad was drenched in a creamy white dressing, not your typical oil and vinegar type dressing that you would find on a Greek salad. However, the feta was great and a good amount. The gyro was average, kind of bland, but piled with lots of meat.  So the summary of this place would be that the food was kind of bland, but nice sized portions.  Ammos on 67th and Happy Valley in Glendale has amazing Gyros among other great tasting mediterranean food!",

It's not fancy, but the gyro meat isn't greasy or over salted, the tzatziki tastes darned good, the salads are generous and the fries are always hot and fresh.

I can only think of one other place that has better gyro because it's a schwarma joint, but it's on the west side so I come to Z's far more often because it's in my neighborhood. The tzatziki sauce is the bomb dot com, and the pita is always hot and fresh. The drive thru line can be a little slow at times, so be prepared to wait a little around lunch time, but totally worth it. The basmati rice is pretty good, not their strongest item, but consistent which is nice. And this is the only place where I've ever had a feta burger, the most brilliant thing since sliced bread!",

    "text": "Pretty much as good as it gets for Greek food in the Valley.  I used to work at the Pita Jungle down the street from Z's. As some of you may know, Pita Jungle serves an array of \"Mediterranean\" food that I (and many others) pity. So, on my lunch breaks, rather than getting my employee discount at Pita Jungle, I'd drive a few block to Z's.   First off, I love that they have drive-through. It makes things much more convenient for me.   Secondly, their food is amazing. I always order their falafel platter, which comes with a small Greek salad, lemon-potatoes, rice, Greek Pitas, and five perfectly fluffy and delicious falafel balls all for $10.99 or something like that. I cannot express how delicious their falafels are. Compared to anywhere else I have gone to get Greek food in the valley, the falafel at Z's blows them out of the water. They have that perfect crunch on the outside, and are not over-cooked on the inside. They are not overpowered with garlic or parsley, and have a delicate blend of all of the flavors that falafel are supposed to have.   Their Greek salad is also exceptional. The ingredients are fresh, and to my surprise it comes smothered in feta cheese (another thing I love). But, the thing that really makes the salad is the salad dressing. It's a traditional Greek yogurt based dressing with a slight taste of lemon. The thing is, is that it's not overly pungent or sour like some Greek yogurt dressings are. It's creamy and smooth, and tastes wonderful.   All the other components of the meal, like the potatoes, the rice and the Greek pitas are all above-average quality as well. I've also ordered their crazy fries, which are so simple yet so good. Fries with feta and cheddar cheeses. It may not sound good, but it sure tastes good.   If you're looking for great Greek food in the valley, you've found it at Z's",

I guess it's a good thing, because greatness is often overlooked when one is not prepared to see, or find greatness. This place is GREAT. I've spent the better part of 5 years looking for a gyro that takes me back to Santorini, and the other beautiful places in Greece. I ordered a gyro, and when eating Greek, always get a little bit of falafel.   The gyro was exquisite. When I got to Z's, I was still reading reviews from other Yelpers on this place, and fully intended to continue reading. i couldn't put the gyro down. The sauce in the gyro was perfection. It was stuffed full of meat. The lettuce was crisp and fresh, and the onions looked like they had just been cut. And that sauce. It would find its place in my heart faster than any ranch dressing ever could.   The falafel was dynamic. Tons of robust, distinguishable flavors overtook my mouth. Not all at the same time, but on their own time throughout the bite. Toasty nutlike flavor, with the smoothness of the chickpea, and then the bang of the coriander, finishing with the subtle notes of the other herbs, and more toasted fried flavors. Unreal.   The service is incredible. My gyro was on the table at the same time as I sat down after filling my beverage cup. They are friendly, gracious, and love making great food. The restaurant is also impeccably clean.  I will be be back regularly, and frequently.",

Given the portion of meat they give, I don't know how the few pieces of pita are enough.  The meat - a beef/lamb combo, is seasoned well, a bit salty and greasy - not unexpected.  The main concern with the gyros are a lack of produce on the side.  The platter does offer a greek salad (which had lettuce in it along with the cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, and feta, which was a bit different, but I would have liked to have some undressed produce to go along with the gyros and yoghurt.  The platters are also served with a side of rice - soft and flavorful, but nothing too spectacular.  There is also a huge side of roasted lemon potatoes.  And this isn't some minor lemon flavor... it's strong.  I also ordered the falafel on the side.  Crispy, and served with tzatziki.  They're delicious, just a bit small.  However, they're inexpensive enough to just order a few extras.  (Order 4 falafel and save a penny!)  Staff is friendly.  There's a drive through available and plenty of seating inside, although the decor is a bit old and furniture is run-down.  Not worth an out of the way trip, but the volume of food is generous and the prices are reasonable.",

    "text": "Fabulous Greek food at a fast food restaurant WITH A DRIVE THROUGH???  You betcha!  I ordered the lamb souvlaki platter with a Greek salad which was covered in feta so thick you couldn't see the lettuce or tomato!  The dressing was rich and creamy.  They served thick pitas (not the flimsy store bought kind)  with thick and creamy yogurt sauce.  The lamb was tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned!  The sum total of it was A-MAZ-ING!  My brother also ordered the souvlaki, though he substituted fries for the salad and he was thrilled with his meal also!  I was only in town for four days, so I didn't have a chance to go back, but even now I'm having fantasies about a return visit!  I think I may need to schedule another road trip to Phoenix to try some of their other offerings.  This city has the best food!!!",

This is not the traditional Greek soup- I am sure there is a Greek somewhere crying in shame for this.  Somebody commented they didn't like the food but they did have a drive thru- that is True and I went through it- they didn't answer at the 'place your order here' sign, so I went directly to the window.  While they are very friendly, it took almost 10 minutes to get two of these bowls of 'rice broth'.",

The pita bread was delicious and fresh and so soft, and the meat was packed full of flavor and was delicious. A much better gyro overall than Spartan. Next time I go I'm gonna ask for extra sauce because there wasn't very much sauce at all so it was a little dry. But with extra sauce that would be dynamite!  The crazy fries were seriously ten times better and bigger than Spartan's and they were sooooo good. Definitely worth giving this place a try.",

    "text": "I've never had Greek food before and thought I'd give this place a try....  Location & Aesthetics - located on E. Indian School Road and not difficult to miss with their large signage out front. This place reminds me, in terms of their layout, of The Stand - similar in terms of seating, the interior, and drive through. Parking is available alongside the restaurant and also available toward the rear.  There is no parking on the side of the drive through as it's a bit of a squeeze there. Lots of room and seating inside, and there's also seating outside, though I didn't see any misters in operation! The restaurant was well lit with all of their tables and chairs clean. Noise level wasn't bad with two TV's on, on either side of the restaurant, in the corner ceiling.  Menus - located above the check out.  It's not as detailed as what's on their website, however the cashier, who also takes your order, was available for any questions.  Service - Staff was very warm and welcoming.  We were greeted when we came in. Staff answered any questions we had about the menu, and even made recommendations which was much appreciated. When you're ordering to dine in, staff (very friendly) will bring your food to you and ask if there's any thing else you need.  Food - I had the Gyro Platter for $10.95 which entailed seasoned beef and lamb cooked and sliced off a rotisserie, and it comes with pita bread (about 5-6 triangles); also served with rice, Greek salad, and roasted lemon potatoes.  I have to say, for $10.95, do they give you a lot of food, so much so, that I couldn't eat it all and left the rest for dinner. Rice was well seasoned and cooked well.   The Greek salad was fresh and contained lots of fresh Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, bell peppers, Feta cheese (not too much to overpower the salad but seemed the right proportion), and olive, and two sides of Greek dressing. The beef and lamb were seasoned perfectly though appeared somewhat on the dry side (-1).  My perception of gyro was that the meat was supposed to be moist as it cooks on the rotisserie but I could be wrong.  Overall, I would recommend this place, and myself, would love to return to sample their other dishes like their pita combos, salads, and some of their interestingly named Greek platters!",

It came with a handful of fresh veggies, which was a perfect amount to compliment the amount of meat given. 5/5  Dolmades: These dolmades, although flavorful did not match the flavor profile I am accustomed too. Whenever I have had dolmades before they were served cold and  were extremely lemon-y. These dolmades were served warm with more of an allspice, nutmeg, or cinnamon flavor profile. Overall, 3/5 for the dolmades because they were served warm and lacked the tang that I love! (Still good, just not what I was craving/expecting)   Fries: I mean, can you really mess up fries? 5/5",

SO when headed to another restaurant down the street and found they were closed, I decided to give Z's a shot. The husband had a gyro and I had a chicken pita and we shared some hummus. I asked what the difference was between their two chicken pitas and they told me nothing.... that's weird.... why list two pitas that are actually exactly the same? Anyway, the hummus was ok, but nothing special. It was a little on the bland side, but the pita bread was fluffy and tasty. The sandwich was also ok....The veggies were fresh, but I wish it had more garlic or something else to add to the flavor. To be honest, the best thing we had was the salad dressing.... so flipping good! Anyway, I probably wouldn't make a special trip here.",

    "text": "I recently started a new Job and my biggest problem so far is that I don't get to z Greek often enough now. I learned of this restaurant because I saw the owner shopping for his produce nearly every day. Loving food I eventualy stopped to see where it was. I always support family ran businesses so I went the next day.  This started me down the road to best addiction ever! I try real hard to not eat beef but I can't resist their giros. The lemon roasted potatoes are hands down the best i've ever had. The rice pilof they serve isn't just filler. The rice is perfect and could be a stand alone meal. Lamb skewers are exceptional and the portions are over the top. Dine in and grab a table. This place is family ran and the girl runnning the counter juggles all tables at once and doesn't miss a beat. Her personality would keep me going back if the food was sub par but nothing could be further from truth. I did learn that the lamb is best eaten there but even later it taste great. To give you an idea of this places quality I had a standing order to just double my order and bring it t o a coworker and she would pay cost plus $5. The salad they serve with all meals would be plenty for lunch but my willpower loses out every time. Find this place. Excellent value and a great family.",

Like a lot of joints around here the decor is blah but the food outstanding! Large salad with gyro/chicken is enough to feed two adults. They're not stingy with the tziki sauce either. I appreciate that they cut the corners off the to go boxes so your fries (awesome too) don't get steam soggy. The service is fast as lightning and always friendly and a smiling staff. Everyone behind the counter looks alike so I'm thinking this is a big family owned and operated. I love this place. Also a dead on hangover cure.",

    "text": "Good!  I always get the falafel platter, or plate, or whatever.  It comes with falafel, fluffy rice, and lemon baked potatoes.  It also comes with a greek salad, a tub of tahini, and some pita slices.  What I don't like: the greek salad comes utterly covered in sauce and feta.  As in, the entire top of the salad is white.  I realize this is a mega-bonus for some, but I avoid dairy, so I normally just give the salad away or sub it for fries, which are very good.  Everything else in the salad is fresh and crisp.  I also really don't like the tahini...or, I think it's tahini.  It is super sharp and heavy tasting, not really what I'm used to in the tahini-department, and is really thick.  Spackle-thick.  The potatoes are amazing.  So very good.  I asked if they use butter in them and got an answer of \"probably not.\"  Not quite the answer I'm looking for, but I agree - probably not.  The pitas are fresh and delicious.  The falafel is always pretty good.    You're gonna wait.  Especially if they're busy.  Prepare to sit in the drive through for 15 minutes.  I always see the same two young guys working the counter, and they are always very friendly and gracious.",

Also, the tzaziki sauce must have been with the missing meat, as there was no evidence of it on either sandwich. A savvy staff would have compensated immediately, no questions.

I thought I might have time to read a few emails while waiting but was wrong. The pita bread was soft and warm, the tomatoes and lettuce was fresh and crisp. The meat perfect and sliced nicely.

If you don't care for feta tell them easy on the feta they do tend to pour it on.  On to the gyro, great soft, warm, pita bread.  The meat was very tasty and the tomatoes were not soggy nice and firm as they should be.  The tzatziki sauces is thick and tastes great.

Big selling point for me personally, as I've gone there more than once to work. No outlets really, though, so make sure your device is charged when you go.  I love getting the combo meals - comes with your choice of a salad or fries. I bet the platters are good, too; those include even more food, and do not cost much more.

The meat was well seasoned.  The baklava? Amazing!  I have to hand it to the man working the counter. He works hard! He takes orders inside, takes phone orders, handles the drive thru, AND delivers your food to you if you're sitting down.  Definitely going back.",

I'm a gyro connoisseur, so I can tell you that this is the first place I've ever been to where it was in chunks.  Ruined the mouth feel of it. Tsiki sauce is okay, not the best.  Sorry, but whoever says this is the best gyro or lamb souvlaki hasn't had good Greek food, and I feel sorry for them because they are missing out.  If you want a good gyro, try the Persian Garden Cafe on Thomas road, then tell me this is the best there is.  If you are ever in Seattle, you have to go to Mr Gyro if you want the best of the best.",

The seasoned fries are great so if your splurging don't miss those (note: they taste unbelievable dipped in hummus!! Trust me!).

All the Greek flavors that are usually on a real Greek grilled chicken are not there. My family tried the Gyros with fries. The fries are good however, the Gyro again not authentic Greek. They add lettuce and tomatoes and we all know a real good Gyro is full of lamb, tomatoes and onions with a great tzatziki sauce. The Gyro meat was dry full of lettuce and that tzatziki sauce is NOT yogurt and Cucumbers it's SOUR CREAM!!! What in the world???

    "text": "If rating only the food I'd happily give Z's Greek 4 stars. We had the gyro platter, which was spot-on; lamb souvlaki, which was roasted to perfection; and falafel, which was both delicate and dense.   However, since we were looking for a place to eat dinner, I have to include the atmosphere, which was definitely one of a takeout joint. In fact, it appears to be housed in a former White Castle, which is great for not uaving to repaint the classic blue and white Greek theme but not good at all for diners. Eating with plastic cutlery and on a Styrofoam plate is barely two-star worthy.  Connecting the dots between the excellent food and the picnic under fluorescent lighting is the young lady holding the while operation together. If she doesn't already own or manage the place, she should...unless she is planning a career in air traffic control, at which she would excel. She kept plates coming, orders moving, and attended to customers with a fantastic smile and positive attitude amid the seeming chaos at the front counter.  A+ to her and to the guys cooking this delicious meal. If you plan to eat souvlaki on the couch during movie night, then get in line here.",

I ended up getting the regular Greek chicken salad with feta on the side. The salad was so flavorful and filling. The amount of food given to you is perfect as well. I actually ended up boxing mine to-go only to eat it right when I got home of course! Lol   The service was phenomenal and the prices weren't bad whatsoever.

They redid the other order since I peeked in to make sure it was mine.  Nice to see because I could imagine some places just giving the other customer that bag I looked into.   Very happy with the food. I'm a huge fan of tzatziki sauce and this place was just right. I should learn to make my own batch to store in the fridge and put on everything I eat.  Yes, the salad has  a ton of feta, but I think it's better to have a lot and scrape some off than to have too little and wanting more.    Atmosphere isn't anything special - more of a quick-bite and/or carryout place imo. I'll be back to try their meat dishes.",

I got the gyro platter, which came with sliced gyros, pita bread, rice, lemon potatoes and a side greek salad. It was a lot of food but I wanted variety so I went ahead with it.   I was not impressed. The gyro tasted a bit gamey to me. The rice was sort of bland and the potatoes were too lemon-y with no other flavor or spice. The greek salad and tzatziki sauce was pretty good, though. I'll give them that. I think the sauce saved the meal for me.   Maybe I ordered wrong, or it was an off day or something but  from what I had, I'll have to say I like the gyro at my local chicago style pizza joint better.",

We debated about going to the busy Italian place down the street but based on all the reviews I said let's try it.  I did notice that while we were there a consistent amount of traffic was flowing. A lot of drive thru orders!    I am a huge fan of Agnanti's in Astoria, NY so I am a bit biased when it comes to my Greek intake.    The food comes fast and boy do they love styrofoam. We probably ordered too much so the bill was almost $40. I know we ordered too much because we took home enough food for two days!  We started with some tzaziki. It was tasty. Not too powerful could've used some garlic or something not quite sure.  I had to try the avgolemono. I can only compare it to Papaspriros in Oak Park, IL which is no longer. I wasn't a fan and will not get it again.  My husband had a Greek salad with grilled chicken. He said he liked it. And I had a village salad and moussaka.  I wish the pieces in the salad were bigger and the tomatoes were riper and not so cold. The olive oil dressing was tasty.  The moussaka wasn't bad. Once again I think it needed something but I probably would get it again just to figure it out.  It came with its own salad and rice which half ended up on the table.   Like I said we had a lot of left overs and my husband would like to return. I would've given it three starts but the extra star is for my hubby.  We'll be back.",

    "text": "There is nothing better than good Greek food except lots of good Greek food. While visiting Phoenix this week, my wife and I decided to go to Z's Greek. After pulling into the parking lot with only 2 cars in the lot, we were skeptical of the drive-in looking restaurant having 4 1/2 stars. Boy, we were very pleasantly surprised. We ordered the lamb souvlaki and chicken souvlaki platters and were amazed at the amount of food on the plate. The lamb was cooked medium rare instead of being overdone and the chicken was grilled and seasoned perfectly. Both platters had a huge heaping of Greek salad with a lot of feta cheese not just a sprinkling.The pilaf was spiced and again not too dry; there were 4 small local potatoes which were a nice change from the one large one over soaked in oil. The hummus and tsaziki  were also excellent. I couldn't finish all my salad but we took home the desserts- strawberry cheesecake and tiramisu (baklava also) which were only $2.95 each.The platters were very reasonably priced at $9.95 and $10.95. I noticed other customer's orders being very large. There were quite a few pickup orders also served while we were in the restaurant? We are Canadians from Vancouver who have eaten a lot of Greek food in restaurants, food trucks and Greek festivals and we would rate this meal as one of the best  in terms of quality, quantity and value we have experienced. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and we will return on our next trip. Did I mentioned there also is a drive up window service available.",

Their ingredients are always fresh!  Their pitas are fabulous always warm and soft and DELICIOUS!!!  The hummus is pretty good it can a little oily at times but I still really like it!  The gyro is awesome!  The lamb is always so tender and never hard (some places its so hard, its nasty).  The Tzaziki (spelling??) is great!  I like how it doesnt seem like sour cream or mayonnaise!  It is fresh and is perfect with the fresh lettuce and tomato...and of course the feta cheese!  If you are looking to go to a really nice greek restaurant this is not the place to go...it is set up like a fast food restaurant and their is a drive thru...I think it is great if you are in the mood for some good Greek food that is quick and easy!  The prices are good and the people there are very sweet!  TRY IT!!",

The Gyro Philly is very good. It comes just like a regular gyro on a pita bread but is topped with feta cheese, onions, and peppers with no sauce. Maybe I gave it a 4 the first time because its 8 bucks for a gyro combo but it is definitely worth it.  The gyros here are just massive. Just a truck load of meat that is hot and fresh and tasty. I'm not sure what was keeping it from being a 5 star review as it is consistently one of the best gyro shops I have been to. Their tzatzki sauce is excellent.  The bread is always soft and delicious.  They dont hold back on the toppings.  It's almost like a hybrid between fast food and a restaurant. You order at the counter, they bring your food out to you and then check on you to see how you are doing every time you eat there. They also have two flat screen TVs w/ ESPN and the news on. I wish this place was closer to my home and I would probably have tried everything on the menu by now. For what Z's is, it is hitting on all levels and I would have to say its just about as good as it gets.",

Like another commenter said there have been many failures when it comes to the location of Z's Greek:  Maxie's Hamburgers, Nachos Taco Shop, Coconut Joe's (which I Really liked, especially the \"Big Kahuna\" burger) and some Chinese restaurant which was there for such a short time I forget the name of it now, but none the less I knew Z's had their work cut out for them.  Well here we are 6 months or more and Z's Greek is going strong.  The gyros are great and I absolutely love the pita and feta cheese dish.  My ultimate favorite that you just have to try is the feta burger, oh my god it is to die for.  Great service, friendly people, and a good hockey game if you are there at the right time.  Make sure you stop by Z's Greek if you are ever in the area of 40th St. and Indian School Rd.",

Don't let the exterior of this place deter you from stopping by.  Z's Greek looks sort of \"a dive\" from the curb and they desperately in need to repave their parking lot which is littered with pot holes. BUT, and I mean a big BUT, the inside is very clean and welcoming.    They have a fairly large menu of Greek selections to choose from.  I tend to order the same thing ~ Gyro with a side Greek salad in lieu of fries and drink for $7.95.  On this visit I added a side of hummus and pita chips.    This Gyro was packed full with meat, tomatoes, red onions and thee perfect amount of tzatziki sauce.  (see pic)  The pita was tender and warm which made this Gyro full of flavor.  The Greek salad comes with a mound of feta cheese on top of a great balance of lettuce, veggies and dressing.  I would highly recommend their salad over fries any day when ordering a combo.  The hummus was very tasty ~ smooth and fresh.  You can order anything to your liking if you don't see something on their menu you are familiar with.  The Z's Greek Crazy Fries and Souvlaki's are also very good.   Z's Greek is a great place for lunch or dinner when you're craving Grecian cuisine.  Just look out for the pot holes when you park : -)  You won't be disappointed and glad you tried Z's Greek!!",

A typical visit to Z's with my FFY* consists of reviewing the menu, considering new things and then deciding to get what we always order. If it isn't broken, don't fix it!  My personal favorites are:   Gyro - Z's is generously filled to nearly bursting with juicy and flavorful Grecian Delight. No Kronos here, like so many others serve. I like mine without the tomato and onion, so I can enjoy the cool lettuce and perfect amount of tatziki, embraced by a soft, warm, pillowy pita. I have yet to finish one, but have certainly enjoyed trying!   Falafel appetizer - crisp on the outside and tender inside, these falafel are complimented by a side of hummus and warm pita.   If you are really in the mood for a decadent and potentially heart-stopping treat, try the Z's Crazy Fries. These fries, topped with cheddar and Feta cheese, are fantastic when dipped in tatziki!   While this family-run restaurant is not going to blow you away with its beauty or ambiance, you will keep coming back for the food and the friendly staff.   Now if I can only convince them to move a bit closer to where I live...   * FFY - Favorite Former Yelper",

    "text": "Z's Greek has been a favorite of mine for ten years now; BUT, let me tell you why this place is THE place to get your food.  They have literally saved my life there last few months. I've been so sick and dealing with horrible nausea, respiratory issues, and a cough that just won't go away that eating anything has been difficult.  Whatever this illness is that's got hold of me, it's a real bugger. After weeks upon weeks of no appetite and not being able to keep much down, I finally found the delicious food at Z's was just the ticket for helping me bounce back.  My favorite dish is the chicken souvlaki with the lemon rice and potatoes, Greek salad, and chicken skewers. BEST. FOOD. EVER!!!  I think the entire crew knows me by sight, if not by name. Being sick as I have been, I can always count on Jessica's sweet chirp to answer the phone or Karen's kind voice on the other end; these ladies know my voice, my name, and my car.  As sick as I have been, I kept trying to find something palatable for me to eat. One night, by chance, I asked if they had any of the Avogolemono (lemon rice soup) available. They DID and it was like the gates of heaven opened up and offered me the remedy that even better than chicken noodle soup!  The white meat chicken, carrots, celery, rice, and the lemony deliciousness of the broth instantly made me sleep better and start to feel better. I've probably eaten ten gallons of the soup just in the last month, but oh my God! It's the best thing I've ever tasted and it REALLY does help clear my chest, put some sustenance in me, and heels me feel a lot more healthy.  When I say it's this soup that's kept me alive all these weeks, I'm not joking. There's very little I seem to be able to tolerate and enjoy as far as food goes; but Z's lemon soup really does help keep me going. I cannot stress the importance of good health and the food at Z's has always been so delicious!   If you happen to be in the area and are looking for something REAL to eat, stop into Z's Greek and try ANYTHING on their menu. It's authentic, it's delicious, and it just might save your life!  Say hi to Jessica and Karen and the rest of the staff. They are all exceptional people and well worth trying out their plates, gyros, souvlaki and especially the soup!",

    "text": "After moving to Scottsdale part-time a couple months ago, Z's has quickly become my comfort food go-to. There's nothing better than a warm falafel sandwich with a huge, beautiful Greek salad. We discovered this spot while staying in the Biltmore/Camelback area, but I now drive out of my way to make a stop here, and even come here by myself. For $8-$10, you can get a huge plate of food that won't make you feel guilty and terrible - all of the food here is insanely fresh and gooood. You won't miss the In N' Out - I promise.   Z's is located right on Indian School Rd., in a building that looks like it might have served as a drive-in burger joint back in the day. It's always the same two young ladies running the counter when I come in; super friendly, fast, and they never screw up my order! They've got sodas, but also real iced tea and fresh lemons - if you're going healthy but still want to feel like you're getting fast food, this is definitely your stop. All of your Greek classics are here - Gyros, falafel, pita, hummus, olives. I've yet to order anything that wasn't great.   The prices are right, the service is awesome, and the food keeps me coming back. I hope this place is around forever!",

Establishment has plenty of parking and once inside has a dive-like feel to it down to the classic imbalanced dining table. Felt like I was eating on a teeter-totter.  Menu is straightforward and simple. I ordered the classic gyro with a salad.  Overall, the fare was decent and was surprised our meal came out in foam containers and given plastic cutlery.  Definitely not a deal breaker but just more of a letdown considering their food is actually pretty good. It they give no thought to presentation or customer perception.  Wasn't blown away by any means but wasn't disappointed either so it turned out to be middle of the road for me.",

I'll admit I always get the same thing, the gyro combo, because I got it the first time I came here and it was so freaking good I never want anything else.  The value here is great, the combo is about 10 bucks and you get a huge gyro served on a delicious white pita, with the most tasty gyro meat, lettuce-but not too much like some places have, onions, tomatoes and taziki sauce. I always get sirracha and add it, I would highly recommend doing that, it just goes so well with the flavour profile of the gyro.   In terms of sides, I have branched our. The Greek salad is piled high with feta, and is super deliciously simple. The fries have a great flavour and are crispy on the outside yet soft inside.   In terms of atmosphere, it's super casual and divey but feels very relaxed. There's a small patio that I love to sit on. Inside they do have TVs for all you sports fans.   If you come here, make sure you are paying attention because the turn come up quick and it's easy to miss, but they have a huge blue and white sign that will show you the way.",

Once I returned my rental car and got to the terminal. I wolfed it down and still had more than 1/2 left. It was so good I decided to take it on the plane home.  Didn't want to waste it. But tsa pulled me aside and tested the box but it smelled sooo good the tsa agent wanted some! Hahaha. I told him where I got it and he was going to go there after work",

    "text": "It was good. Was it amazing? No.  I judge all gyros by the standard of a place on State St in Madison that I consider to be the epitome of gyro excellence.   The fault in this gyro's stars was really its dryness. I expect a gyro to be juicy to the point of greasy. I also like it to be slathered in tzasiki and onion. These qualities (or lack thereof) could all be benefits for you depending on your point of view. So take this assessment for what you will.  The option of a side salad was a nice touch and I enjoyed that. Although I think the whole mentality of offering a healthy side dish option is part of why I didn't enjoy the main dish. Just sayin'",

Not many days following my service to them, I decided to gallivant to this locale. Like The Stand it has that \"Mom & Pop\" look about it. I love that. Simple. I was greeted by Karen, and having  eaten little Greek cuisine, Karen helped me out in deciding on an appropriate fair. I am not a fan of Lamb at all so she suggested the Chicken Pita. Good choice.  I selected their small Greek salad as my side. The veggies were crisp and fresh, and the dressing was rich and creamy. Very delicious. The size of this Pita was immense. I'm a big guy and could really put away some groceries, but this was big. The chicken was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. The dressing and vegetables were a delicious part of this gargantuan mass of Greco-tastiness. The pita was soft, easy to chew and had a slight buttery taste.   The ambiance was very casual with traditional Greek music playing, fitting to the bill of fair. I recommend Z's to anyone looking to try Greek cuisine for the first time or to the seasoned Greco coinsure wanting a high quality meal for a great price. Under $9.00 was impressive for the portions. I will return, and so should you.",

I have had higher quality and better tasting Greek food before, so its hard to justify giving anything higher than 3 stars.  I don't eat beef so I have never had the Gyro, but the chicken is decent.  The one thing I am disappointed is that the skimp  out of the meat.  I feel like I am not getting True value for my buck when I order the chicken platter.  The sauces they provide are good but need a little bit more garlic and zest.  Overall considering the time of the day I get food here (late at night near closing), I would still return because of the drive thru option that is convenient when it is blistering hot or raining like crazy during a monsoon.",

My favorite meal on the minute and the most ordered for me is the Chicken Souvlaki Greek Platter that's served with a side Greek salad, rice, roasted - lemon potatoes and war pita. Honestly, it's kind of hard to put how good the food is in words.  Literally every single thing on that Chicken Soulaki platter is delicious. The chicken is seasoned and grilled to perfection.  The rice is cooked perfectly.  So are the potatoes, you can cut them in half with just your fork.  I normally eat my side Greek salad first, because that doesn't travel too well, just an FYI. The portion sizes are huge, you'll definitely have leftovers for lunch the next day.  I always do! Stop in, you won't be disappointed.",

I literally ordered my food at the counter and the server brought out my food in   less than 5 mins - hot and fresh. The restaurant is not super attractive looking, but it is clean.   I ordered a Gryo Pita Combo with the greek salad and a side of Crazy Greek Fries. Oh my goodness, it was A LOT of food. The gyro pita was HUGE. Lots of meat, lettuce, sliced tomatoes and tzatziki sauce. The Greek salad was pretty good, but it was SO cheesy. So if you like feta cheese, you'll love the salad. It was almost too much for me, and I L.O.V.E. cheese. The Crazy Greek Fries were their regular fries with melted feta and american cheese on top. They were super hot when they came out, I just wish it had a little more flavor and just fries with melted cheese on top. i LOVED their tzatziki sauce and I LOVED that they gave me extra without me asking for me or charging me more.  Overall, the food was great! Service was super fast and nice. It is one of the better Greek places in this neighborhood! I just with it wasn't so expensive. I ended paying about $17 for my lunch. But, I will be back again :)   Environment - 4/5 Food - 4/5 Price - 3.5/5 Service - 5/5",

The restaurant itself is very casual, you order at the front, and they just drop off your food at the table. Their food is also really good to go!

We ended up sitting at the pick up window for 15 minutes. What made it worst is a person in the car behind us got out and walked in and asked for their meal and got it! We had only ordered two items so it wasn't like a party of 10 in a mega van had just made an order. The cashier was polite and positive but never addressed the fact that we were sitting outside this window forever and that customers who had ordered well after us were getting their meals.

    "text": "We were in town on a girls getaway to celebrate my daughter's college graduation with friends who grew up in this area. Mediterranean dood sounded good so we searched Yelp for suggestions. Lots of places had 4 & 4 1/2 stars but we settled on Z's Greek. Wow! So glad we did!!  My 2 daughters and myself split the Gyro Platter, a regular Greek salad, and a side of hummus. We just about licked it all up! The gyro meat was very flavorful and tender and the salad was refreshing. Our friends ordered the lamb kabobs and we decided those were the best. So juicy and tender. The staff was very helpful and friendly. This will definitely be a place we visit again!",

The selection was great and EVERYTHING came out in good time and was FRESH. I ordered the falafels and I was not disappointed it came with yellow rice and potatoes which were also pretty damn good. We didn't have any issue finding a place to sit we dined in and laughed occasionally looking up at the televisions placed in corners of the restaurant. My and lady thoroughly enjoyed our meal sure to go again. The only thing I'd say is be mindful of getting out the parking lot it gets a little tight exiting because of the drive thru but if that's the biggest gripe. This place a winner.",

    "text": "If you're reading this review, I'm assuming that you're considering to, against your better judgment, try the old pizza-hut-looking Greek place with a random drive through that you pass by on the way to Pita Jungle but you're thinking \"It can't be as good as Pita Jungle. I mean, it's a drive through!\"  To you, I have two things to say:  1) For a place that has \"Pita\" in its very name. Z's kicks Pita Jungle's hippie little ass as far as delicious, pillowy, perfect little pitas go. Oh my god they are amazing, I could eat them all day. 2) The drive through is actually Z's Greek's best asset, because the inside kind of reminds me a dumpy fast food place and the drive through makes it a convenient place to pick up food that isn't the complete garbage that comes out of most drive through windows.  Actually, one of the hardest drives I ever have to make is the 2 mile drive from the end of the Z's Greek drive through to my condo.  The smell their delicious gyros infiltrates my car and makes it impossible to concentrate on anything other than GETTING THE EFF HOME TO GET THIS FOOD IN MY MOUTH. I'm an even bigger driving hazard than usual, putting my own life at risk in the name of pita, but it is totally worth it.  I usually get the Chicken Souvlaki pita, stuffed with juicy marinated chicken and a side of tangy tzaziki (I add the sriracha myself), and a small Greek salad, loaded with enough feta cheese it's probably not even a healthy choice anymore. I also LOVE their avgolemono soup when it's not 1 million degrees (though I can't pronounce it and look like an idiot when I try).  I can usually get delicious, filling dinners for me and boyfriend and get out of there for less than $20, which makes it a great, inexpensive, healthy-ish option for nights when I don't feel like getting out of a damn car, letting alone cooking an entire dinner.  So to answer your questions: Yes, you SHOULD try the questionable looking Greek place, yes, they ARE better than Pita Jungle, and yes, drive thru is always the way to go (unless they remodel their inside, which I would totally love, but I don't think it's quite made it to their business model roadmap.) Four stars!",

I immediately get a call from Postmates customer service: I can't get the plate, because they're out of rice and potatoes. HOW does a restaurant run out of rice AND potatoes??? These are staples!  I ended up switching my order to a lamb souvlaki pita sandwich. It was okay. It had maybe three pieces of lamb, and lots of vegetables. The vegetables were fresh, but there were too many conflicting flavors going on. My tongue was very confused by the whole experience. It was the gastronomic equivalent of one of those big-budget 3D movies that have no plot.   I probably would have enjoyed my meal better had it been in plate form, as I originally ordered. So I might give this place another shot.  I did not like the falafel at all, nor the garlic tahina sauce that came with it. I thought it tasted bad. I like my falafel crispy outside and fluffy outside. This falafel had a more uniform consistency, almost as if it had been frozen and microwaved.  Like I said before, I know I caught them on a bad night, and I'll probably give them another shot.",

Last Friday, on Halloween, I had a gyros platter, complete with rice, roast potatoes, a side salad and grilled pita.  The gyros was hot, with crispy edges, piled high.  The rice was golden, well-flavored and not sticky/gloppy.  The potatoes were small red potatoes, perfectly roasted.  The cut side was carmelized and the taste of lemon was perfect -not overwhelming.  The salad was wonderfully fresh and crunchy, and their dressing was tart, salty and went well with the generous amount of crumbled feta cheese on top.  The tzatziki on the side is excellent, as usual.  Darling wife had a chicken pita with fries. Both were terrific.  They salt the fries with a seasoned salt and they are always hot.  (Let's not even start on the Crazy Fries.  That's a whole 'nother level of AMAZING).  GREAT FOOD.  GO.  ENJOY.",

    "text": "Wow.  Am I lucky!  I had a yen for spanokopita (spinach pie) and Yelpers led me to try Z's Greek.  I bit of a trip for us but we travel for good food (or what we think might be good food).  The place and the parking lot was not crowded for a Saturday evening (which I use as an indicator) but we took a chance.   AND we're glad we did!   BTW, there is no wait service.  You order and pay and then they bring out the food to your table.  The people at the counter were quick and delightful.   Had the Spanokopita platter which came with rice, red lemony potatoes, pita bread and a Greek salad.  I asked them to double up on the potatoes since I am not a fan of rice (don't report me to my latino ancestors).  Upon arrival, the platter was huge.  The greek salad with full of feta cheese with fresh lettuce tomatoes, green peppers and AN olive.  DELISH, DELISH, DELISH.  The pita bread was NOT the bag pita.  This was real, thick  greek pita bread.  The red potatoes were amazing--Not overcooked and lemony.  The Spanokopita (they gave me two pieces) was very good but to me it lacked salt.  I think more feta cheese in it would have made it perfect.  I TOTALLY enjoyed my meal and had left overs to take home.  Hubby had the Lamb Souvlakli platter which came with two skewers of grilled lamb with green peppers in between the chunks of meat.  He had the rice with the red potatoes, pita bread and greek salad.  WOW, WHAT A platter for under $11 considering the high price of lamb in the supermarket.  Nicely done too!  Hubby loved everything on his plate and his empty plate was evidence of that.  Desserts were $2.95.  Do YOU think we were leaving without dessert?  No way, Jose!  Ordered chocolate cake and tiramisu cake.  Both were really, really, really, really good---but I have to say that the chocolate cake was better than the tiramisu.  The chocolate cake was made of DARK, DARK, DARK, chocolate with chocolate shavings (dark) on the icing.  OMG... just thinking about it makes me want to drive back and get another one.   Hmmmmmm,  why didn't I bring an extra one home????????   I guess I can't think straight on a full stomach.   BTW, Z's Greek has many other things on the menu such as burgers and hot dogs-- so if you are eating out with your kids and want to have Greek food,  you can still have your Greek fix and give the kiddies what they like.   One more thing----the lack of cars in the parking lot was evidence of the fact that they do a brisk take out business. So my concern of not seeing cars was unfounded. I for one am going back again and again for my Greek fix.  I saw people ordering chicken souvlaki platter and it looked amazingly good.  Is is bad manners to check out other people's food when you have your own?  This is something Jerry Seinfeld might ponder about.  Not me.  I want to look and see what you are eating so I could eat it next time.  Enjoy Z's Greek.  I most certainly did!!!!!",

No, the ambience isn't as cool & \"Arcadia-esque\" as Pita Jungle nearby but the food is definitely 10 times better.  I suppose they could renovate the exterior and interior, make it look a little more inviting but that would probably result in higher prices?  Best to keep it as-is, simple is just fine so long as the food remains good.",

People, I lived in Greece and think that this place really rocks the gyro!  Not to mention that the service at the counter was with a smile even for the last order of the night!",

The staff was great too. Nice guys.   The price is really good and I feel like I've had a huge meal too. I'm still full.",

A co-worker suggested Z's Greek, and I obliged since I was feeling quite indecisive. As soon as we pulled into the parking lot, I immediately regretted that decision. I was brainstorming excuses left and right of the reasons why I \"wasn't hungry\" or was worried about how greek food would \"settle.\"   Then a lush, green, scrumptious looking salad came out of the kitchen. I ordered one. Pronto.  It had tons of lettuce, a really tasty dressing, the perfect amount of cheese, and gyro meat... and I didn't want the lunch to end! The salad itself is to die for, the lettuce is always crisp, the tomatoes always juicy, and the pita points on the side just finish it off perfectly.  Granted the wobbly booth wasn't the most comfortable seat, and the ambiance was sort-of nonexistent. But man, their food and friendly service will keep me coming back.",

I had the classic gyro. Delicious!! Perfectly seasoned meat, a fantastic pita and fresh vegetables. What's not to love? You have the option of having either a salad or fries with your meal. I went with the french fries. These fries are DECEPTIVELY good!! They look like your typical frozen fries, which they are but somehow they are great and are seasoned with season salt, always a plus.  Man am I salivating right now just thinking about it. I would like to add that this place is value for its buck. The portions are huge and appropriately priced. I will be back for sure and sooner than later!!",

It was a ton of food.  The meat was great and the pitas were fresh.  Plenty of tzatziki.  One of the best Greek salads I've ever had with plenty of cheese and it was very flavorful.  The rice and potatoes were really good too and I usually don't get to excited about those at a greek place.  I also sampled the falafel (good), baklava (great), and the spanikopita (amazing).  I sort of wish this place was closer to my side of town so I could go there more often.",

My best friend had a Gyro combo that she said was fabulous. None of us left hungry!  We also had my youngest who was not feeling well. I was thinking she had a hunger headache I'd hoped she would eat once she smelled the food, but that wasn't the case. She declined to order, then sat down & laid her head on the table. One of the guys working (looked to be an owner maybe?) was wiping down the table & asked if my daughter was stick our just tired. We told him she was feeling sick. He then offered her since soup. At first she declined but then after I told her it'd help her throat she decided to get some. When we went to pay for it the gentleman wouldn't allow us to! ...That really touched my soul & for that, besides for the already amazing food, we will be customers at Z's for life. Thank you!",

I ordered the greek salad with lamb meat and the tzatziki appetizer. the tzatski sauce was AMAZING. perfectly creamy and flavored. the pita bread was soft, still warm (i got delivery) and filling. although i'm not sure exactly sure how much pita bread i would have gotten with the \"appetizer\" because the 2 salads i ordered also came with pita bread on the side.   the greek salad was huge - like seriously heavy to carry. the lamb meat was plentiful and delicious. and the dressing was good too - creamy but not too heavy.",

Coming from New York, where all kinds of ethnic cuisine is plentiful, I was wondering if I'd ever find a place. I have tried several places that have high Yelp ratings in central Phoenix and have been disappointed time and again. I don't believe in posting bad reviews for every crappy establishment I visit. I don't feel it's productive, and I think I get more helpful info from the positive reviews I read anyway. So, I just chalk it up to trial and error, scratch it off the list, and move on to the next place. This place is so unassuming, and so delicious. Those two things usually go hand in hand, right? The people are friendly, the food is delicious, they're fast, and reasonable. I will definitely be coming back for more. We sampled a few things... the Hummus, tzatziki, falafel, gyro pita, moussaka, and chicken souvlaki platter. The pita was not dried out, which is a rarity. Everything was so good! The feta was not super salty, the falafel wasn't greasy, the gyro and chicken souvlaki weren't over seasoned, not dry, just right. The hummus was perfectly mild and tasty. We had a variety of things on the menu, and they were all prepared perfectly. It was refreshing, felt like I was back home in NYC. I think we might make this our Tzatziki Tuesday meal rather than tacos. DON'T MISS OUT! They won't disappoint! Fact!",

I cruised through the drive through and got my order from a friendly bearded guy who has been working there for ten years. The prices have only increased about $2 each for the combo's and now stand at $9.95 for the loaded greek salad and my chicken Breast pita. They put both sauces on the side and that is really a nice touch and the food is great as well. Plenty of white chicken in the fresh pita and the salad of course was packed with feta cheese and lettuce. The sauces were top notch and for sure I will be back monthly now, not four yearly.",

I tasted a portion without any condiments or extras, just to check the flavor of the chicken and it was delicious, perfectly marinated and cooked.

When you walk in you might think it wouldn't be that good but it made me feel even better.  The falafel was great, was moist and had a great flavor to it.  The pita it was warped in had to be made by this place.  It was fluffy and had a great crisp to it.  All of the fixing that went into it were extremely fresh and I truly enjoyed it.  Then came the salad which I decided over the fries. I have never had a salad with so much feta I had to pull some off.  Good thing I like feta on my falafel as well so I didn't waste it!  I will definitely come back to this place to try something else for a cheap meal! Way worth it.",

    "text": "There comes a time where every Yelper just have to set the record straight and get a lot of criticism for doing so... Now is that time for me and Z's Greek.  Z's is a cool spot that looks a little gritty on the outside, but is warm and friendly on the inside. The staff is super friendly and I like that a lot! Overall, the restaurant has a great vibe about it.  Now for the part you don't want to hear... I do not come to Z's for their gyros... Not at all. Calling their gyros the best in the valley urks me. It's just not True.   ***************************************************  Gyro Review:  In all honesty, it's just okay... The meat is decent and the tzatziki is good, but it doesn't make me crave Z's at all. Their gyro is served a bit differently than the traditional style in that is has a helping of lettuce added to the top of it. It's great for filler, but not so much for flavor. The best way I can describe it is that it's like eating a gyro salad on a pita. Another main component of Z's gyro that doesn't do much for it is their bread. The texture is just off for me. I wouldn't send anyone here telling them that they HAVE to try a Z's gyro.  ***************************************************  If you don't hate me yet and you're still reading, great! This is just my honest opinion, and plenty of others are thrilled when it comes to Z's gyro...just not me.  In contrast to their gyro, I will say that their falafels are quite good! I was pretty surprised. Their tahini is also pretty awesome (which is served with the falafels). And lastly, you SHOULD go to Z's if you love feta! They are the most generous with it! I love feta, and that's what's been keeping me a customer! A chicken pita with a side salad (more like feta salad topped with lettuce) can really hit the spot!  Go to Z's to check it out, but don't go there with as high of an expectation for their gyro as I did.",

    "text": "A delightful experience!  Visiting from out of town attending a convention in downtown Phoenix, we checked Yelp for Greek restaurants.   Although Zs Greek was a bit of drive from downtown, the reviews of this restaurant made me want to check it out!  We were not dissapointed! Greeted by the son of the owner, a nice mid 20's young man, took our order, brought it to our table..Oh from the first bite I knew our lunch-dinner was going to be a hit!  The review for this place do it justice.  A BIG WINNER in my book. Easy FIVE STARS.  Thank you Yelp, and thank you to the dad and sons that run this place.  If you are looking for great Greek food, and do not need a fancy restaurant, this is your place.  I just wish they had some wine to wash down a tasty meal!  Keep up the good job. From Seal Beach So CA, Steve",

It's pretty close to my house, so I thought I'd try.  It was pretty good.  I got the Gyro Platter.  The lure of the lemon potatoes was too good to pass on.  Well, the salad that came with the platter was great, the lemon potatoes weren't as lemony as I'd hoped.  The rice that also came with the platter was pretty dull.  The flavor of the meat was very good, and you got a ton of it, but I found it to be rather greasy.  I got it to go, and when I got home, there was quite a sheen at the bottom of the styrofoam.  Not quite Exxon Valez, but enough that I wrinkled my nose at it.  This made the pita sort of damp-ish.  I was also rather surprised that the gyro didn't have any sort of veggies on it (I asked for it without onion) -- I would've expected tomatoes!  The tzaziki sauce that came on the side was very yummy though, and would've liked to have had more of it -- especially since there was so much meat.    The restaurant itself looked very clean -- pretty basic looking place -- not a place to go for ambience.    I don't know that I'll be rushing back, but it was ok.",

Unlike the Mexican incarnations, though, Mr. Greek actually has something tasty to serve. I scratched a pretty serious itch for a gyro platter there. I got a huge mound of gyro meat, an excellent side salad, some lemony roasted potatoes and a scoop of rice. Oh, and some pitas.  The bits of pita were pretty forgettable, but the rest of it was really everything I needed. Not a bit of dryness to the meat, and the side dishes had everything on-the-numbers.  It's a very casual place, so don't expect anything fancy. I had a great time watching a Blackhawks game while inhaling the contents of my platter, which was a nice bit of ambiance for the Chicago native in me (but when the Hawks play the Coyotes, I'm rooting for the Coyotes, thanksverymuch).   Mr. Greek isn't gonna change your life, but it's a nice addition to the neighborhood. Go there, and help these guys from becoming another notch on this cursed location's failure belt.  PS - That's nto the real phone number. I just don't know it.",
