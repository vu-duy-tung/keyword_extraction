The prices are a little higher than expected, but it's a popular establishment and the staff are friendly!  I'm a huge fan of bibimbap, and I love that their hot pot bibimbap comes with Kalbi! Our table also shared a seafood pancake, and it was really yummy! A lil more shrimp than I would have liked (esp since they were of the frozen baby shrimp variety), but it was crisp and had a good consistency!  Didn't get a chance to try any of their bbq items, but their tofu soup lunch special looked good! Side dishes were okay. Good variety, but I was hoping for some fish cakes or cold noodles.",

But this did not take any away from the dish. My husband ordered the pork belly it came to the table sizzling away and was cut into smaller pieces. The pork came with a few sauces and fixings like garlic and jalapeno. The pork was very tasty and not at all fatty.   The banchon was great my favorite being the cucumber and fish cake. Had a very nice meal.",

We got there and sat ourselves at a table near the center of the restaurant. It's a kind of a hole in the wall but you can tell it's a great place due to the people and atmosphere. Our waitress was kind and patient as we decided on the bone-in pork and some spicy chicken. Before our food came out, we were offered a variety of different small bite appetizers of different vegetables, potatoes, etc.  My love ordered some Korean sake and I ordered the hot tea that they offer complementary and I was pleasantly surprise to fine it was made of wheats grains. Healthy and amazingly delicious! I was so impressed by this tea, I asked where to buy it. I was blown away by the young lady's response. She said it was right next door at the market and she happily offered to walk over there with me right then in order to point out the correct one! Cannot get better than that for customer service!  The food was pretty amazing but the staff definately made this experience!",

So I've been looking around for a while to find a Korean restaurant so I could get some kimchi (little did I know Fry's has it in the produce section).   Thanks to Yelp...Hodori is the highest rated Korean food restaurant I've found. It deserves the rating. The people are really nice, and the food is really good. Did they make a kimchi fan out of me...not really. So why just three stars? I was really lost when it came to ordering and everything. I didn't know what to get and what was what. I wished the waiter could've explained the side dishes and everything.   I would definitely come back, but only with someone who's a little more familiar with Korean food so they can explain to me what to get and what I'm eating.",

However, there wasn't much of the other ingredients - where's all my oysters? One pawn? :( There's little chucks of beef. I wanted more of the other ingredients.   The side dishes came out at the same time as the main entree. There's lots of side dishes. When I came, they didn't have the little fish ones I like. :(   Service was slow in giving us our check and follow up on our meal but what do you expect? It is an Asian restaurant where I don't expect quality service.  Overall, decent pricing for the items on the menu. LOTS of options on the menu - I was surprised to see casseroles, bossom, etc. I like that it has everything! Parking is easy. The place is relatively large. It is in a complex with other asian stores. It doesn't look like it's in the best neighborhood in town but it's hard to tell when it's dark.   Come here if you like authentic Korean food because there's not lots of places in Arizona for actual Korean food!",

    "text": "Objectively speaking, this restaurant is positioned right in the median line among Korean restaurants. However, I've lived in both LA and SF for several years each, so I could be a harsh critique here.  This is the only Korean restaurant in Tempe (aside from the one-offs like Paradise Hawaiian BBQ) and so you're not exactly picking from a bunch anyway. The food tends to be well-portioned, though many of the dishes had been pre-cooked and are just heated to order (i.e. Yukkaejang). My biggest discontent is the price, which is quite expensive comparing against the price level of other Korean restaurants I've been to, and absurdly expensive when compared against the other restaurants of similar caliber in Arizona.  The best thing happening here is the pancake, so definitely try it out if you're new to Korean food. It's about $13 (maybe even $15?) and serves as a great appetizer to split between 3-4 people. Don't go for the happy hour stuff-- they are puny in portion.  The second best thing happening here is the service, though it depends on who you get. The younger servers tend to be really friendly, well-spoken, and willing to take your fight to the kitchen for you. For example, my Yukgaejang (spicy noodle soup) showed up with no noodles-- the girl server had the kitchen serve me a whole side bowl of noodles and soup for free! The older servers, by contrast, tend to be hags.",

I have notice the service is so much better. You gotta know that this place is BUSY.....and that there are usually 2 or 3 servers for the whole restaurant so make sure your not in a rush or you will not enjoy your food. We usually get the tofu soup (spicy w/ egg) and lunch special spicy pork, lettuce wraps and go to town. My first bite makes me do a butt chair dance cause it's that good.

    "text": "For starters:I am an american that grew up in a very korean dense population. My best highs chool girl riend's family ran the best Korean restuarant in town so i am a bit spoiled.  That being said, I hadn't had any korean food in about 5 years, I started having cravings that wouldn't go away. Bulgogi and kimchee are my favorites. I suggested Korean food for a date one night.  Atmosphere: Was fine,very casual nothing to write home about american family resturant style. I had REALLY hoped for table top cooking because I think it is just more fun that way. makes things more festive. I also like a bit more traditional korean decor.  Service: I had a Teenage Korean American girl who spoke perfect english and was polite but not very attentive. She looked like she hated her after school job.  Food: It was good but not great. We both ordered Bulgogi Which came in HUGE piles on sizzling plates witha layer of White onion underneath.the flavor was good but it was bit dry. The Side dishes were excllentt, I loved the Kimchee(the white radish and cabbage),potatoes and the sprout salad. Yummy.  Wine: First time I had korean wine at all. We chose the rice wine that came in a wooden bown. We both loved this. My date is Indian and they have a regional drink that is identical he was so excited when he realized. It was sweet mild and I really liked it  Overall, I liked the place and would definitely go back. We are trying a new Korean Place tonight so I am interested to see how they match up.",

    "text": "The Kimchi Jjigae (stew/soup) is great! One of the best I've had in town next to my mom's though. She makes the best. The next favorite item is the pork bulgogi bbq. These are the only two things I get every time I go so I can't really comment about the other stuff. The side dishes they bring out are okay but again I keep comparing everything to my mother's cooking so everyone else is not really getting a fair chance.   Price:  A bit pricey but the portion is large. $11-15 range for the dishes I mentioned. Two people can split a dish.  Atmosphere: Mostly Korean's as customers, relaxed nothing special, and crowded after church on Sundays.  Service: hit or miss, be patient, no one is trying to give bad service on purpose, relax, get up and ask for something if you can't bare it any longer. (it really depends on how many servers are working and how busy it is)  Top two Korean food place in town. (they have awesome stews/soups)",

Score! Then the barbecue meat with rice. It is pretty okay for me but the meat is a bit tough. I though Korean barbecue beef always tender? However, minus one star for the bathroom. I really lose my appetite when come to the bathroom. It is really dirty. They should have cleaned. Until it clean, this remain 4 stars.",

Their broth was good but I feel like they're being cheap with the rest of the toppings that should be in the dish. Normally when you order this dish at other Korean restaurants, they give you a couple slices of beef brisket and a whole boiled egg along with the usual pickled radish and cucumber shreds. Hodori's neng myun does not come with any meat and they only give you half of a boiled egg for the same price....  My mom got the bibim neng myun which is a spicy noodle dish with no broth and it was ok, spicy and sweet. Service is usually slow, it took almost 15 minutes for someone to bring us water. At the end of the meal when they give you your check, they usually bring out a yogurt drink for everyone at the table but I noticed some tables would get the drinks and others wouldn't. I'm no sure if the servers just forgot or what but they should work on being more consistent with that.",

After I ordered my food, the side dishes arrived, and they were all very mediocre.  The kalbi was cooked to a good texture, but it sadly lacked flavour.  The yuk gae jang soup was relatively good, but it also lacked flavour.  It tasted like pure spiciness, rather than having other tastes.  The kimchi fried rice had an absolutely wonderful garlic fragrance, but I couldn't really taste it because of the spiciness.  Once again, this dish lacked flavour also.  The least worst dish, in my opinion, was the soon tofu.  It had an overall fuller taste, and was the type of soon tofu one would expect at a decent Korean restaurant.  A good part of it was that it did not have a powdery texture from the tofu.  The service was inattentive.  Although they were quite busy, it was necessary to ask for anything we needed, since no one came to check on us.  I was glad to have been able to eat some Korean food in Mesa, but I wish I had found a restaurant with better food and more attentive service.",

There was less meat in the kalbi tang than usual, and the largest piece was not kalbi meat but either from the neck or foot.  The naeng myun and kalbi, again fine.  The meat was a little fatty, both for the kalbi and kalbi tang.  The ban chan were good, nothing special.  Solid lunch, not bad for $10 (for the kalbi tang alone.)",

I came here with a large group of people and service was on top of it's game needless to say.  Nice and funny at the same time!  I ordered my favorite of course the Seafood Tofu Soup, while some of my friends order the Dol Pan Bibam Bap; a vegetarian dish for sure. Finally the the Bulgogi hot pot.  I can say I enjoyed my Seafood Tofu Soup.  The Bibam Bap was nice, but not as flavorful according to my friend.  Nicely plated for sure I think.  Finally the bulgogi was sweet, but definitely needed more spice!    Overall, pretty good place for a quick Korean home style cooking.  You don't get a lot of side dishes like some Korean restaurants, but I didn't really cared for it anyways. Enjoy!",

    "text": "This review is based on only one lunch time visit.   The day I came this casual Korean Eatery was packed with people (a good sign..?) but only had two servers working as a team to wait on EVERYONE.   Our order was taken in a timely manner and we waited around 25 minutes for our lunches to arrive.  I ordered the grilled Atka Mackerel. As tasty as this fish was....and it was...this meal was almost impossible to eat because it was filled with hundreds of tiny bones. I don't think fish with this many bones should be on any menu anywhere. I do note the side dishes with kimchi, cucumbers and four other sides were tasty and mostly delicious. I thought they seemed above average. A better choice would have been the Black Cod with Radish but the price difference was just too much difference for lunch time. Mackerel was $13.99 and the black cod was something like $26.00.   Back to service I wanted to ask questions about a few of the sides but nobody was able to check on us during the lunch.  My husband had the Kimchi Bokum Bap.(Ribeye in a hot stone pot with egg). We both thought the ribeye was tender and tasty but lacked any heat. I think some sort of hot Korean Sauce should have been given with this dish?  This is a place that I would re-visit but I do have some reservations about some of the dishes such as the mackerel and the lack of service. So for me that's three stars. Still a positive rating.   I do note this was a holiday weekend and it's possible they might have been busier than expected and short on help.",

Because I do not like meat, I have usually gotten the regular bibimbap with tofu. I just pick out the bean sprouts and bracken fern stems and ask him to pop my yolk so my fried egg is fully cooked. I douse it in gochujang and chow down. So satisfying.   Recently I've tried the soon tofu soup with mushroom. It's really, really mushroomy. The regular spice has no spice at all, but the spicy is damn good. I put gochujang in mine, because I think it gives it a better flavour. The mushrooms they use are chewy and substantial. It's really good, but I wish they would put other veggies in it considering it is a vegetarian soup.   Their side dishes are good as well. I don't eat the fish cake nor do I eat the kimchi, but my friends have said the kimchi is good. My favourites are the potato and the cucumber ban chan.   My friend always gets the beef soon tofu soup and loves it. My gf has gotten the seafood soon tofu soup and liked it. Their summer special is a ginseng chicken dish. My gf got it last week and really enjoyed it.   I'll be back for their Korean wine tasting!",

    "text": "EDIT: So we went back a second time because even though I wasn't very impressed the first time, my boyfriend loved it, so we met some friends for dinner and I gave it another try. And now that I've actually found something great that I really like - a rather filling soup with beef broth, dumplings, and rice cakes - I have to bump up my review from 3 stars to 4. Having something that I enjoyed eating definitely improved the experience this time!  ---------------------------------------------  I'm not very knowledgeable about Korean food and had never been to a restaurant like this before, but it's close by to where we live and my boyfriend wanted to try it.  Immediately I noticed that most of the menu items had the little red pepper next to it indicating it was spicy. I'm a bit of a pansy when it comes to spicy food, so it was unfortunate that automatically ruled out the majority of the menu for me. I ordered the Bibim Bap, which was essentially a large bowl of cold vegetables with a little meat and a fried egg on top and a side of rice - not bad, but if I'd known the dish didn't have much substance to it I probably would've ordered something else. My boyfriend ordered the Nakji Dol Pan, which was basically octopus and vegetables on a sizzling stone plate with rice. He let me try a bite of octopus without the spicy sauce on it, and while I thought it was a bit chewy he still enjoyed it.  The service was pleasant and accommodating, and our waiter was glad to answer any questions we had about the menu. Definitely no complaints there.  Overall I didn't have a bad experience at Hodori, it just wasn't fantastic. We'll probably be back eventually, and I'll try something else on the menu that will hopefully be more to my liking.",

The last time we went to a Korean restaurant worth mentioning was a place in Nashville TN (Antioch TN) called Hai Woon Dae.  This place ranks comparable to that.    I ordered Dalk Bulgogi (Chicken Bulgogi), and it was good.  The chicken tasted very fresh.    My wife ordered Soon tofu with pork.  She liked the soup.    All of the common sides that were brought out to us were very good also from the kimchi, to the eggplant, to the bean sprouts.  My wife and I will go back to this restaurant.",

We got the daeji bulgogi and the seafood tofu soup. The tofu soup was just the right spice and warmed our bellies. The meat came out sizzling and tasted sweet and spicy. I wished that the meat was cooked a little longer because I like a little char, but still yummy! The only downside was the side dishes. There were only a few that I liked: kimchi, seaweed and the fish cakes. The others were not as exciting like cole slaw and stuff. Not a huge deal though.   I was still really happy with the food and would come back again!",

Everything was really great and had a lot of flavor, the two soups were also very very good and I would definitley recommend to a first time korean food tryer. The reason why I'm giving this 4 stars is because service was just okay. Nothing special. The waiters didn't really seem to care about the food or anything. Secondly, I realized that I'm not the biggest fan of korean food, but that's just me. And third, the prices were a little high. Around $90 for a family of 4/5 (My grandma eats almost nothing XD). So, we may come back here if we're really craving korean food, but it's not \"too die for\"",

The server brought us out a sweet soy sauce for our meat without us asking for it so we were really appreciative.  The only criticism I have is that their BBQ meats are not one of the best I've had, but I typically don't come here for that anyway because they make up for that in the many other dishes that they cook so well.  Also, Hodori is located in a plaza next to Saketini and a Boba cafe so you have options for places to go to after dinner if you come with a group of friends.",

Everything is served hot and fresh, or at least it all tastes like it. The sides are endless and the servers refill it as soon they see the containers emptying. Be aware, however, that the rice is just one little bowl and you have to ration it till the end of the meal. Not all dishes come with rice. My complaint here is that when I went with a group of friends, two of us ordered the kimchi fried rice. When the food was served, my bowl contained rice that didn't even come to the half-way mark. On the other hand, my friend's bowl was heaping. Yeah, it may sound petty, but when I pay $10 for a dish, I want it to fill me up or at least be sufficient. I brought it up with our server and all she said was they made it together in one pot and just added it to the bowls and they wouldn't give me more. Needless to say, I left there not even content. I finished my rice in about 3 or 4 bites. Other than that, it's a fantastic place.",

    "text": "Took 5 minutes to get a menu.  Another 5 to get our drinks.  We ordered what we always order at our favorite Korean place which is the Bulgogi, and mushroom tofu soup.  I figured these are very popular dishes, and easy measuring sticks to compare different places.  They give complimentary salad which includes iceberg lettuce... and teriyaki sauce.  No thanks.    Bulgogi:  Really wasn't good at all.  It was too thick, the onions were 100% raw and there was no flavor beyond intense onion and poorly bbq'd beef.  It should be THIN, and TENDER, and FLAVORFUL.  Failed in all aspects  Tofu Soup:  Server asked how spicy we wanted it, and we said normal.  Apparently that means zero spicy or just adding 3 jalapeno slices into the soup.  That's authentic right?  They also use a very runny type of tofu, not the more firm stuff I have and like at my other spot.  It really had the texture of egg whites.  In fact, it had the exact texture of the egg white that was also in the soup.  So it was just watery flavorless broth, with textureless tofu and textureless egg b/c it wasn't hot enough to properly cook the egg.  Factor in the tough mushrooms that were obviously re-hydrated and you have a very poor dish.    They stiffed us bowls or plates, unless they expected us to reuse the salad bowls so we had to wait around for a while to ask for something to eat on.  They also brought the dishes out at different times which is bad form.    The best and worst parts were actually the sides.  What the hell are those shrimp, and why are they on my table?  They were dis-gus-ting.  Kimchi didn't taste fresh, bean things weren't that good, bean sprouts were too mature to be good and the cucumber thing probably sat around too long and got soggy like cucumbers like to do.  The daikon kimchi was the only solid side.      My go to place is Cho Dang in Chandler for my Korean BBQ.  It blows this place away on all levels.  Their meat is of much higher quality, they actually include stone rice with their soup, serve amazing sides, and the atmosphere is a lot less cafeteria like.   To top it off it is about $5 less for the same exact order, but with larger portions of sides, rice, and meals.  Really isn't a whole lot of good to say about this place.  I'd give it 1.5 stars, not quite bad enough to get a 1, but certainly not good enough to simply earn a \"meh\" rating.  I actually started this review by giving them 2 stars but as I started writing I realized there really wasn't anything positive I took away from the experience.  Couldn't even get an iced tea refill for the last 10+ minutes we were there.  Guess I'll still have to drive 15 minutes down to Chandler rather than 5 minutes to Mesa for Hodori.",

One male guy was busy and said with he will come back to us very soon (which actually took ~10 minutes). During those 10 minutes, my friend tried to ask another female person to take our order; however, she said \"exu...\" (not even a word...) and basically ignored us. Later on she went to take another table's order who came later than us. A bit upset. Finally, thank God, our order was taken. We did not expect that we waited for another 20+ minutes before the food is ready. Unfortunately, this is NOT the end of the story. When they gave us the check, I expected Yakult to be served as a compliment soft drink, as they gave to other tables right before us and they provided Yakult last time when I ate here. However, they did not serve us Yakult as expected. I feel I am NOT equally treated. What they did is apparently not fair. At that time, I am completely upset to them and decided will NEVER EVER come back again. Just FYI, I live in this area for 3+ YEARS and eat outside a tons of time.

Hodori, LA is literally surrounded by 100 other KBBQ spots.  Anyway, service is whatever..... nothing special, which is to be expected at a Korean establishment.

    "text": "When I ask if tofu can be substituted for Kalbi, I'm not saying, \"Is it possible?\" Obviously it is, and that's what I want, so don't say, \"No, we can't do that\". Yes. Yes you can.  That micro-altercation aside, the food was overpriced and pretty bland. I (shamefully) dumped half the kimchi sauces in my Dol Pan Bibimbap (which literally translates to stone plate mixed meal.. it's composed of mushrooms, spinach, egg, bean sprouts, and carrots over rice on a hot plate-bowl), which then became palatable, but nothing special. On the upside, the vegetables were fresh and plentiful, but the rice didn't even get crispy, which is the best part of rice in hot stone dishes.. and there was no tofu to mix it with, which means I'll be going elsewhere because a) Dol Sot  is better than Dol Pan and b) No other restaurant tells a customer straight \"No.\"",

    "text": "As a half Korean individual, I find myself to be a little less discriminating about traditional Korean food and Asian food, in general. However, if I was to recommend a Korean spot to someone who was raised on pure Korean tradition and looking for a bite of home in the East valley, Hodori would be my recommendation to that person. 80% off the guests at the restaurant on a Sunday afternoon are Asian. Good sign? I think so. The food is undeniably delicious to me. Please be warned, the service is slow. They have a couple servers most of the time waiting on a fully packed restaurant, but I've grown to appreciate the experience and I won't go when I know there's someplace I have to be later that day. On a hot day, try the iced barley tea.",

I took a chance and went again last night.  The resturant was packed.  It looked like there was also a private party happening as well.  Dispite the place being crowded I had to admit the service was really good.  The only issue I would have had was nobody asked if we wanted a refill but since we had soda and water we really didn't need it. We did have to flag servers down for other items and they were responsive. I had the bulgogi and it was good and filling.  I guess you can say I saved some money coming here instead of one of the many all you can eat places that opened.   Dispite being super busy the food arrived within a reasonable time so no complaints there.   Overall a great experience",

Service was friendly, however, and everyone else liked the food, so it'll earn and \"A-OK but won't be voluntarily coming back\" from me.  We had the bulgogi hot pot and something called bossam.

    "text": "I would've gone for just under four stars, given the option, because the food was pretty good at best and the service was polite, but slow. I went there on Wednesday, 1/7/09, around 7 p.m., with my BF for his first eat-out Korean dinner. It's in the northwest corner of Dobson and Southern, just north of the gas station, in the same shopping center as Oregano's and Saketini.   Mostly, I wanted to try to find tofu soup--crazy-soft tofu pieces in flavorful spicy broth with whatever add-ins you want, from seafood to beef to mushroom to kimchi. YOM. You could smell the spice and sizzle (much of their dishes are served on hot plates, and meat always gives off a certain smell when charred up deliciously like that). Decorations were sparse and the lighting was almost a little too bright, like cafeteria-bright, with the tables and chairs set up diner-style, in neat rows. It wasn't packed (one half of the restaurant, I guess an overflow section, was dark until a couple showed up later), but business was steady. There was a big group of athletic-looking Koreans in the middle of the room having a seriously happy chow-down (everything looked good) and several Korean and mixed families and couples.  The hostess/waitress waved at us from across the restaurant to ask how many seats we'd need, then waved us to a table. After that, it was a bit of a wait before we got menus. They had an interesting selection, and by that I mean appetizing, choices and decent prices, with entrees starting at $9 and capping in the $20s. They also have a decent selection of lunch specials. It was a somewhat agonizingly long time before anyone came to take a drink order. By the time our polite, attentive waitress came, we were ready to put in our entire order, so we put in for drinks (which came quickly), goon mandu (dumplings) for an appetizer, short ribs, and tofu soup with pork and mushrooms.  The dumplings came without our getting impatient, and they were pretty tasty--slightly crisped wrappers and plenty of filling. Shortly after we finished, we received our banchan (traditional Korean appetizers on several small plates). I doubt I can remember all of them, but it included kimchi, kak tu gi (radish kimchi), gam-ja (braised potato and carrot), k'ong na mul (bean sprout salad), seaweed salad, and one or two other dishes, which was more than enough for both of us. We thought everything tasted just fine. After we'd enjoyed the banchan for about 5-10 minutes, they brought our little bowls of rice, then our little pile of short ribs on a sizzling plate (with a polite warning not to burn our hands off) served over raw, thickly slivered onions, and after a few moments longer, our tofu soup in a little hot clay pot. They also brought a raw egg in case we wanted one cracked in.   The ribs were good, but just a little tough--they're supposed to be that way, but if you're expecting something the consistency of all-day braised short ribs, these aren't them. I loved the tofu soup--eat it as soup or over rice, which is ten times better. It was AWESOME, but I\"m biased because it's like comfort food to me. Soft, creamy tofu curds in spicy broth (they ask you how spicy you'd like it, if you want it spicy at all), and just enough pork and mushrooms to still keep it tofu soup. It hit the spot.  The wait staff was pretty good about keeping my BF's glass of diet coke filled, and that was a feat in itself. It kind of took awhile for someone to bring the check, but when they did, they brought a few tasty coffee candies. We considered desserts, but we couldn't find any in the regular menu or on any special menus.  Overall, the service may have been a little slow, but it wasn't for lack of trying--plating and delivering and clearing the banchan plates alone can be a Herculean task. We really enjoyed the food and plan to go back again. Our overall dinner was a bit pricey because of the short ribs, but it would be easy to get away with a $25 dinner for two if you went for a couple tofu soups and a couple of non-alcoholic drinks.",

    "text": "When comparing this place to the previous Hodori of days past it has gone down hill considerably. I have seen it's ups and downs but with changing of hands as if it were currency this place has been through a lot. The current owner who ever it maybe is doing it a little better than the others but that's not a far reach from them.   This like a few other Korean places in town specializes in Tofu stew. The stew here when it first opened many many years ago was very good. This restaurant if you think about it changed the way many Korean restaurants are done here now. The way the food is, the look and I have to say the onset of the tofu epidemic to AZ.   The stews are good right now with lots of flavor and and great portions of meat in them if you get the pork or beef. The stir fry pork bellys with spicy kimchee is my favorite and the spicy octopus stir fry is good as well.  There aren't a lot of Korean restaurants here in the valley but I have to say when Hodori is on point they are good. As far as service goes, it is a hit or miss. But what place isn't like that. I have had days where at Denny's I have spectacular service but poor service here. I just don't expect anything more from Arizona Korean restaurants since it's not like LA.",

Used to be the best Korean place in town but there have been a steady decline in the last few years.  Quality is a little down but the service seems to have taken a cliff dive without a parachute.  Takamatsu is probably the best Korean in town these days.  The korean stews in the stone bowls are so amazing, I pretty much go here for that and the bulgogi.  This may not look very appetizing but try the pork salad, it's a behemoth collection of greens topped with pickled pig feed sliced thinly, very tasty.  The accompanying small dishes are pretty delicious too, but they used to give better quality stuff like real fish, and tofu cakes.  I still go here occasionally for the food but I wish they get a clue about customer service.",

    "text": "First of all, I want to state that the food is pretty good and the portions are huge. I would've been ok with a bit less food and less pricey.  I have been to this place twice for lunch with coworkers. At first I just thought the service is awful, and it takes a LONG time for the food to arrive. Eventually I realized that this place might actually be racist. If you are not asian/korean or if you come with people that are not asian/korean, you get served last. I have observed that Koreans that came in way later than we did were already served with their meals while we waited, waited, and waited some more. This observation really hit home when it was independently verified by a friend as he mentioned he observed the exact same thing. And he's half Korean. So there you go. If you are not Korean, expect crappy service and get your food after all the Koreans have been served, even if they came in way after you did.  Update: We did an experiment the other night after playing tennis with a group of friends. We went there with majority of asian people (3 of us asian and one non-asian person, with one that can at least pronounce the food in Korean). And surprise! Prompt service. So...food is good there, service is to be desired depending on who you go with....",

    "text": "OMG OMG OMG Korean BBQ!  This is the first place I ever tried any sort of Korean BBQ and it's by far my favorite.  I think based on the fact that everyone else in the restaurant except for my wife and son were speaking Korean that this is a pretty authentic place.  Oh, and the menu is mostly in Korean too, and even the parts that are English don't really make much sense and some of the descriptions are horrifying to my uneducated ignorant eyes (you'll know when you see them).  Fortunately there's lots of pictures and I picked the simple Chicken BBQ plate and whooo boy it's super awesome fantastic.  The serving staff all speak English and are really helpful in telling you what is what, but all you need to know is to order BBQ Chicken, Pork or Beef and you'll be happy.    After ordering the server will bring over 8 or 9 little dishes each filled with some sort of Korean appetizer.  There's lots of Kim Chi which I'm told is excellent, but I'm a coward.  The potatoes, though were excellent as were several other things that I tried.  If you finish any of the little bowls you can ask for more at no charge.    When the meal comes out you're in a for a great treat!  Each plate comes out sizzling like when you get fajitas.  They're piled high (really high) with your choice of seasoned meat and onions.  And they also give you a big bowl of rice.    Each bite is heaven.  Oh man, just thinking about it right now just before lunch is driving me insane.  I think I'm going to have to drag Lindsay down there tomorrow night.  We love bringing our friends here.  Hodori is tucked away in a strip mall full of other Asian stores and restaurants.  Its decor is blah, but the staff is nice.  If you're not Korean, don't be surprised if you're the only non-Korean there.  I can't wait to go back.  I must go back.",

    "text": "I've been coming to this place since I've moved to AZ about 10 years ago.  I ate here so often that at one point I was a \"Mayor\" on FourSquare and \"Duchess\" on Yelp!  They've changed ownership twice since 10 years ago, and the new one took over about 4-5 years ago I believe.  Their food's ok, but the best thing on the menu is their kimchi jjigae.  That's the reason why I came here all those times and I don't even touch their banchan, because it's so subpar compared to LA, SF, or NYC that it's laughable.  Their Soon Tofu is average and the Kalbi is average as well.  But you take what you can get here in AZ when you have a craving for Korean food.    Well, if you're serving mediocre food, at least you expect them to provide really good in service right?  NO!!  I have always been unhappy with their service since day one, but I just dealt with it.  Well, I've just had it today and sort of lost it!  The waiter (in his 20s, about 5'11\" tall) who speaks fluent Korean and Enliglish, just pushed me over the edge!  WTF??  Are you kidding me??  I could not believe the service I was getting from this guy!  OK so here's what happened.  I ordered 1 Soon Tofu Jjigae with only beef,  2 lunch special Kimchi jjigae, 1 Lunch special kalbi, 1 lunch special kalbitang. (5 total items)  He brought the banchan (side dishes) and rice and asked me if I wanted eggs in \"all of our soon tofu jjigae.\"  I said I only ordered one soon tofu.  Then he said I ordered 2 kimchi soon tofu, 1 beef soon tofu, 1 kalbi, and 1 kalbitang!  I said \"no I didn't\" and I repeated what I ordered.  Then he argued with me and said \"Yes you did! You ordered 3 soon tofu, plus kimchi jjigae, kalbi, and kalbitang!\"  I said \"are you kidding me right now?  Look here!  We're only 4 people!  Why would I order so many soups for?\"  The guy must be a moron, because he can't even count how many people there are to be ordering 7 items?  Do we look like we could eat that much?  We were two slim adults, and two kids under 15!!  Then he let out a big sigh and then stomped off to fix the order at the kitchen.  He comes back with our food and he literally bangs the soup bowl onto the table!  He is obviously emanating a negative attitude, bangs down the rest of the stuff and stomped off.  I just shook my head and we started to eat.  Half way through the lunch we needed more rice and napkin so I called him over since he was bringing stuff to the next table.  He obviously heard me and didn't bother turning around.  OK, so I'm thinking to myself, maybe he didn't hear me.  I call him again second time and he pretended he didn't hear me.  Then the third time, I called him loud enough for the whole restaurant to hear me and then he turns around, rolls his eyes, makes a face and then comes over.  I couldn't believe my eyes!!  I asked him \"are you giving me an attitude right now?\"  then he yells (yes he yelled at a customer) at me and says \"did I even look at you right now?\"  Then he passes by our table, goes to the next table and \"politely\" asks  \"may I take your order?\"  WTF?  I asked him to help me get something and he completely ignores me?    Ok so let's recap here.  He takes the order wrong, puts in 2 too many orders of Soon Tofu, then gets mad at me when I correct him that isn't so, then he practically throws the food at us banging every chance he gets, and then he ignores me when I call him!  OMG!  At this point, I'm FURIOUS!  I get up and go talk to the owner who happens to be there today.  I reiterate everything that just happened and he doesn't say anything but to just look towards the direction of the kitchen!  Then I say to him \"is it ok for the server to do that to a customer\" and he turns and apologized.  He said that it's his fault for not training the staff correctly.  OK, so I'll take that for an apology, but then he should go quietly talk to the server, have the server come over and apologize to me personally!  Nope, that never happened, and guess what happened next?  The owner comes over to our table, being extra nice, and says he's going to take care of our lunch on the house.  At this point, I'm still shaking from rage and I can't even eat anymore.  I said I'm not making a scene, because I want free lunch.  I'm going to pay for what needs to be pay for, I don't want free lunch.  So while the owner's talking to me at our table, that server is standing near the kitchen talking to another server, looking directly at me, and laughing at me!  WOW!   Just amazing!  I've dined out at so many restaurants over the years in my life at all different levels, from Michelin starred to hole-in-the-wall scary places, but this was just the worst service ever!!  Stay far away from this place!  I called my mother after what happened.  She was at a luncheon with 20 of her Korean friends for a church function.  You can bet that she spread the word.  None of those ladies are going there in the future.  And neither am I.  To the Owner:  word of mouth is a scary thing.",

The staff is really nice, but the service could be just a smidge better when it comes to refilling beverages, sometimes we wait awhile to get our drinks refilled, only flaw. I would definitely recommend this place for some good korean food :)",

    "text": "Excellent food, friendly service.  I came here with a big group from work for my boss's birthday. He's a big Korean food fan, and he's shown before that he makes some pretty good food choices. So I was pretty excited about the potential for this place, especially considering that I hadn't found a Korean restaurant here in Mesa just yet.  We were all sat quickly at lunchtime. Considering that there were about 12 of us, that's pretty good (and the place was mostly full). Our server was very attentive and came back regularly to make sure that we had everything we needed.  The menu is extensive. There are all sorts of choices, and there are a lot of choices that really piqued my curiosity. At some point, I'll try some of the more exotic items, but on this particular visit, I kept it rather basic and had #63 (Mae Un Dalk Bulgogi, which is Korean BBQ chicken marinated in a spicy sauce). To start, we had a few orders of #49A (Goon Mandu, which is pan-fried potstickers). And of course, there was kimchi and a variety of other sides that come with the meal.  The potstickers were tasty. A little crunchy on the outside, and with some of the sauce that comes with them, quite good. I normally don't eat many potstickers, but I had 3 of these.  The chicken comes served with white rice--nothing special about it. The chicken was nicely done. The marinade was excellent! The spice level was perfect, and the flavor was really good. I definitely enjoyed it.  But as I have often found with Korean food, the stars of the show for me were the sides. The marinated cucumbers, the kimchi, the seaweed--all excellent, all with really great flavors. Best of all are those potatoes. I don't know what they use to flavor the potatoes, but they are great! I could eat a whole plate of those potatoes, but unfortunately, they come as a small side. I'm sure that I could have asked for more, but with the size of the chicken platter (lunch portion, mind you) and the potstickers to boot, I was quite full.  To finish off the meal, there's a little dessert that I believe is a probiotic drink. It has an interesting and good, albeit a little medicine-y, taste to it. Always nice to encourage good digestion at the end of a big meal!  I'll be back. And I'll try out some of the ox knee.",

Only downside is having to waive down the servers. You usually only seem them twice. When they take your order and when they're handing the bill. They rarely ever come around to check up on you or refill your drinks. Besides that a must place to come eat at.",

    "text": "Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.   This is the Korean restaurant of my dreams. This review will be solely based on the food, and not the service.   Instead of water, they serve you Korean Bori Cha. Bori cha is only served in the summer, and it's an non sweetened ice tea. I haven't had bori cha in about 15 yrs. Most Korean restaurants don't brew it (to serve to patrons).   I was really impressed by that.   They also serve Raw Crab Marinade(Kye JJang), which I'd been craving for a very long time. This is  also a dish you're unlikely to get at other Korean restaurants. It was legit. For someone who was raised on Korean food, but doesn't get it often enough, I was so happy I could have cried. It was well balanced, spicy, and just out of this world.   My bibim naengmyung was sooo good. I was already sold by the other stuff, but the naengmyung was the cherry on top. It was just like homemade. Their side dishes were generous. We got tofu with soy sauce/chives on top, steamed broccoli, soy bean sprouts, kimchee (which was really delectable), pickled cucumbers, and braised potato.   We also got the fried gyoza. Normally, these are pre-made from the Korean store. Not at this restaurant; you could tell someone's grandma made these. Instead of the standard 6, we got about 10 of them. The dipping sauce was light.  I live 30 min away, but this place was definitely worth the drive. There were a lot of Korean people in there which told me this place was the place to be.",

All your standards are delicious, try something new, you will not be disappointed.   Another thing I love about Korean food, is I feel good after I eat it, because it seems healthier than other Asian cuisine. More vegetables I guess.  They also serve Korean wine and barley tea.

Even when you ask for SPICY. This place listens. I had the pork soon dubu, and the bf had a seafood one. We both were surprised by how good it was. The tofu, broth, and other ingredients were so flavorful. You could taste each individual ingredient, yet it all came together wonderfully. :) The service is pretty fast and efficient. The restaurant was pretty spacious and clean as well. (A lot of other places are really cramped and stuffy).  Why did I take off one star? Their side dishes are subpar. They don't have much variety, and the ones they did have looked old and dried out. They don't serve their soon dubu w/ a fried fish like many of the other soon dubu places do. :( Plus their rice is served in a plain metal bowl rather than a stone bowl. So you don't get that crispy/burnt rice (that you pour water on) towards the end of you meal. :( Also, we requested bori cha, and I think they charged us for it. ^__^",

Everything from the ban-chan small plates to the galbi is done right at hodri. My kids always ask for rice and bulgogi while my wife feels at home eating Kimchi and rice. I on the other hand, prefer the complexity of the kimchi cheagae.  Its typically made with souring kimchi, small pieces of pork, firm tofu, green onion, mushrooms and sometimes some rice cake. I love this stew/soup. The only thing I opt out of is the raw egg they add when the dish is delivered to your table.  The restaurant was packed last time we visited and it seemed that everyone there was craving the same thing i was, Kimchi Chegae!  We watched as table after table were getting their orders, and as the hot bowls were placed on the tables, a raw egg was added to the soup.  I commented to my family that i was going to decline the egg when it was offered.  Our table was up next, a sizzling skillet with bulgogi and onion arrived, it looked and smelled amazing, an order of the delicious pork belly was placed in front  of my wife, then the bubbling Chegae was placed in front of me.  Then the server walked away...but what about my egg?  My family all laughed at me because I wasn't offered and egg with my dish, all in all our food was amazing and I'll definitely be coming back, egg or no egg.",

Because it comes in a stone bowl.... Ok then serve it without one. Gangnum knows how to do this, why is that so complicated? I get offered water while waiting which was nice. About 10 minutes later I get my food and go home. Then I look through my containers wondering where the meat is. There is literally a PINCH of beef in both bibimbops. I call and ask if maybe they forgot and they say no. It comes with very little beef. I ask isn't the egg supposed to be sunny side up and they say not when you order to go. I ask if I can bring back for a refund and the manager says no, they would lose too much money. I ask for an exchange for something else and offer to pay the difference and given the same answer, too much money plus they have to throw out food. Well hopefully I can help save someone else money by not coming here.",

It is a huge disappointment to see this restaurant struggling with services, let alone inconsistancy of food.  Pork blood plate (soon dae) was so dried & hard it was slmist difficult to eat.  There were enough (4) servers & at leat 7 tables empty but forget sitting people...they don't even know who came in first. Servers were all over the place, if not standing & look around. Not sure at what...??? Took 17 minutes for our drinks & serves huge cup to a 5 year old kid but tiny cup to adults. Rice that comes with the soup difn't come out when asked for it, never got it. Went up to the server section to get it & the server said she'll bring it never got it. Went up again & asked I take it myself if they didn't mind. Total time to dine in was 2 hours & 13 minutes. Usually with full restaurant, we would be out in 1 hour & 30 minutes at max. Gave 2 star because stirfry squid was really good with great portion.",

It still holds True and with the lunch special prices (9.95-11.95), my friend and I were able to have the perfect amount of quality food at decent prices. We ordered a Kalbi lunch special and a Japchae. There were probably 9 pieces of that deliciously tender short rib and that was the perfect amount complementing the generous portion of japchae with beef that came out steaming hot. Went at 12:30 and there weren't that many people and the service was overall nice and efficient. He refilled our kimchi banchan generously as well...we can all use a little more kimchi in our lives ! I loved the fact that there was a selection of 8 banchan (small side dishes complimentary to most Korean dining experiences) with the meal and they didn't bring it all out at once but rather with our main entrees. This way we wouldn't get super full on banchan.",

We both also shared a kimchi fried rice with a fried egg on top and it was also very good! I like how the friend rice had those chunks of vegetables and the fried egg added a very savory taste to the rice making it not dry at all.   The service was good could be better but the waiter was nice and the lady came over and gave us some more side dishes. (Side dishes and free refills).

    "text": "A solid addition to the few Korean restaurants in the Phoenix area.  My usual dish at Korean restaurants is Kimchi soon dubu (tofu soup).  A spicy, sour mix of tastiness.  Hodori's version doesn't disappoint.  The nearest competitor (IMHO) is Chodang in Chandler, and I think the dishes here are comparable.  BiBimBop is adequate here.  It seems somewhat lacking in flavor compared to the better BiBimBop I've had in the past, but passable.  We also had the daeji bulgogi (BBQ pork).  Pretty good, but again not spectacular.  The meat slices were somewhat chunky and fatty and the flavor had slightly more american BBQ taste than I'm used to.   Slightly off, but still acceptable and worth a try.  The service here was great!  Prompt and friendly.  Refilled drinks quickly.  Unusual positive for a korean restaurant.  Price is slightly high but not unexpectedly so.  Would go back if in the area, though I admittedly have a slight preference for Chodang.",

    "text": "The Korean Restaurant 1116 S Dobson Rd Mesa, AZ 85202 480-668-7979 I usually come to hodori much times, that's a good choice for us. this restaurant established in 2002 Korean food more and more popular in this modern society, specially to Asian, the Korean food including spicy and light taste, that's can meat different customer requirement. Korean food have delicious taste, and use healthy food, like vegetable, meat, etc, that's all good for our body. Actually it lower calories than American food. When I traveled each cities, I must be Korean restaurant, like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Los Vegas, Korea town is much popular in city, so I try to the much Korean food, I think Hodori is the best restaurant in Arizona, the taste is almost similar in Korean traditional food when I traveled in Korea. Lots of Korean restaurants in US are all varied, ranging from the ones where you cook your own food, to those where they cook the food in the kitchen and bring it to you. Hodori is of the second type. Our friends were seated in a room away from the main stream area. As it turned out, this was good. We started off with seafood pancake as an appetizer.  The pancake tasted good; however, it did not have enough seafood in it. The next one we ordered was japche, which had great flavor. Main dishes were grilled Kalbi and spicy sauteed octopus. Kalbi tasted great. Everyone enjoyed the great flavor of the spicy octopus that was cooked in cabbage and onions.  But I should have ordered squid instead.  Even though the flavor was great the octopus was a little chewy. Our friends also learned to make a lettuce wrap and enjoyed it very much. my favorite food is seafood Toufu soup.  One of the dishes ordered was Korean soup. This is brought out boiling in a bowl, with a raw egg dropped into it at the last minute to cook in the broth. Satisfying and wonderful in flavor. Another of our party ordered Bibim Bap. A dish that is cooked in a red hot stone bowl consisting of rice, veggies and meat, with a sauce that you add to your taste. Again, this was an excellent dish. The Bulgogi and Galbi are excellent even though they are cooked in the kitchen. An assortment of condiments including some excellent homemade kimchi was served with it. This place is truly authentic Korean food. It's even better than the ones in Korea town LA. Their jjaeyook bokeum (stir fried pork with kimchi in a spicy sauce) is the best I've ever had. All their side dishes were good too. But if you come to here in busy period of time, we have been wait for long time, so I hope can recruitment more waiters, that's will be high work quality. As a lot had previously warned, the service is extremely bad. We tried to pay for our food and we were completely ignored by a server who felt that cleaning a table next to ours (while the restaurant was barely full) was more important than serving us.  Overall, I also recommend this restaurant, that's the best Korean food choice in Arizona. (words 508.)",

So to start off the food is just ok, nothing too spectacular but not bad, but the pricing is high for the things here, I can get it at any other Korean restaurant for way less.  So here's is why I gave the place a one star.... The service it's not nonexistent it's pure rude like I borrowed money from them and didn't pay them back!! So every time I ask them about any dish on the menu they look at me like I was crazy, like I was from another planet or something for not knowing what I was asking about was. One time I was there for lunch at 2:30 or so with a buddy of mine and I asked them if I could order the happy hour dishes that starts at 3 and naturally they said no which was understandable so we order and started to eat til 2:57 when I asked again to get something from the happy hour menu the waitress looked at me with a look the a mom would give to her child when he did something bad and replied it's not 3 at that point I wanted to het up and leave  but my buddy said wait and at least finish lunch, ok I finished stood up and asked our waitress for a togo box from behinds the counter she the replied \"for what?\"....I was so done with this place told me buddy to pay and stormed out   So for all you awesome people that read the my whole rant thank you and those who didn't.....well I STRONGLY would not recommend this place to eat maybe to get pissed off at but other then that yeah that's my two cent.",

Their tofu soup is offered with a variety of meats, kimchi, seafoods, and vegetables. I tend to get their vegetarian one that has seaweed, kimchi, and mushrooms. It tastes great. The jap chei (wrong spelling!) is vermicelli noodles with meat and veggies. It is also very good. The best part about this place are the side dishes. They always give you a lot and they taste great, except when they put something american in there like sliced hot dogs. The service is also great and I love the endless supply of side dishes. You get a lot of good healthy food for a small price. Their tofu soups are around $8.95 and come with rice and all the sides. Their bbq is a bit more expensive though. They also have these delightful coffee candies they give you with the bill.",

The beauty of having baked iron is you can cook it as you wish. Raw meats on top and vegetables and stir it as fast you like. Not sure how they do it in Korea but super good food went back for two bowls in one sitting.  Anywhore, Hodori came very close to when I live in Japan. Waitress, nice as heaven spoke to me in Japanese when I was speaking in Chinese to my friend. She was soooo nice. The food, too well! And I filled up on soju! If I could get the same waiter and soju, coming back again! But it's always too packed! Expand please!",

They serve more banchan when the kids are with me, and that's a good thing because they love their veggies and kim chi.  Seafood panjeon is always a must, it's the kids' favorite item besides the bulgogi.  It's huge so we always have leftovers to take home.  We always get their spicy pork too.",

The pancake tasted good; however, it did not have enough seafood in it. The next one we ordered was japche, which had great flavor.   Main dishes were grilled Kalbi and spicy sauteed octopus.  Kalbi tasted great.    Everyone enjoyed the great flavor of the spicy octopus that was cooked in cabbage and onions.  But I should have ordered squid instead.  Even though the flavor was great the octopus was a little chewy.  Our friends also learned to make a lettuce wrap and enjoyed it very much.    Overall, good food and good service.",

Being that I'm not so well versed on Korean food in the first place, and that the prices can build up really quickly, I don't have an incentive to order more to try. All my friends agree the price is rather high, but that's because we're all college students. lol. But all in all, it's not a bad place at all.",

The meat is nice in the fact that it is not just little bits hanging off bone as I was originally imagining. But there are plenty of flanks of meat off the bone, and quite delicious. The Kimchi is nice- crunchy, perfect sourness and spiciness.  Being that it was a Tuesday night, I didn't expect it to be this busy. There were 2 waitresses handling all the tables and were pretty busy and stressed. One of them emphasized that this was particularly a busy night. I make a note of it and can only think that it's because the food is great, and it is!  A little more expensive than I thought:   2 Dinner Short Ribs (comes with Kimchi sides) + Kimchi Pancakes + White Rice = $57. (No tip included). Of course I tipped, but it was a little more than i was expecting to pay. However, the most authentic Korean in town, no doubt.",

A server killed the thing with a tissue directly off from the table and took it back to show it to the manager. Manager didn't come immediately to remedy the situation but took  time to come. He brought our check and apologized saying that he will give us a 20% discount! I couldn't believe what he was offering. Who knows where the roach was before I spotted it on the plate! He asked me if it was a small roach or a big roach. I don't know why that even matters. He was more about justifying himself rather than taking care of the customer. It took some complaints from my end to get it to 50% discount. Later, I was still bothered by it and I told this experience to a friend. He called the manager asking for a full refund of the meal. The manager tried to justify by saying things like they didn't see a roach on the table...it was on the floor...it was actually an ant not a roach...he even took a picture of it.... I mean seriously??? Why would he lie like that?? I wasn't going to write this kind of review but after hearing from my friend how the manager distorted the facts of what had actually happened, I decided to post for the manager to see how his actions have resulted in huge disappointments. I really hope the restaurant takes this post seriously and take proactive changes to the current restaurant condition and BETTER customer service.",

There were few people in attendance, but soon most tables filled.  Most were Asian! We had potstickers and pork shank appetizers.  Excellent. My wife had brisket soup and I cod soup.  The portions were very large and came with 6 different and very good kimchi - bean sprouts, bok choy, potato, cucumber, cabbage... Excellent value.",

I love how much variety there is on the menu, and I never leave here with an empty stomach considering how big the portions tend to be and the fact that there's refillable banchan and an occasional complimentary side (e.g. small soups or tea and stuff in the winter). I definitely recommend their barbecue, dolpan bibimbap, kimchi fried rice, army stew, tofu soups, and seafood pancake! I have to order at least one of those every time I go because they're that awesome.  I'm giving this place four stars mainly because of service and food inconsistencies. Service has gotten better over the years for sure, but it can still be spotty at times. There are days when the employees are great at keeping up with refills for drinks/banchan and even offer extra rice on the house. However, there's also days when it takes forever to just flag someone down to get more water. As for the food, they change up the banchan regularly; I find myself usually liking the change or hating it. Portion sizes for regular meals can fluctuate for better or worse, as well. In my experience, I've gotten three samgyupsal slices instead of two (yay), one eel slice instead of two (nay), etc.",

I was so pleasantly surprised by the extra 5 side dishes, marinated tofu, zucchini, cabbage with pasta, kimchi and cucumbers. They were all tasty.   My soft tofu soup with mushrooms and beef was very flavorful, hot temp, a bit spicy and I added rice. My hubby liked his seafood soup very much too. I will certainly return with friends to enjoy another meal.   The waiter came by as I finished savoring the last bite of tofu and asked if I'd like more, since they had extra. I said sure 2 pieces. He was generous and gave me a bowl of it.   I know a couple of Korean expressions and when I used them he bowed so respectfully, it was charming to see and I was flattered. 'Anyo'",

One of the things that a lot of restaurants get wrong is not refilling water or pop, but at hodori the wait staff is on top of it, by the time I had finished my glass of water they were already refilling it l. They smile and engage with the customers. It is a truly wonderful experience to eat at Hodori.",

I usually don't order chicken bulgolgi because often it's either a little dry, bland or both. That was definitely not the case here. The chicken was exactly what it should be. Full of flavor and not over cooked. I was surprised with the barley tea too. It was all awesome. The person I went with ordered a noodle dish that I don't think I would have been fond of but they loved it! The service was really slow but that was my only issue and even then it wasn't that bad. Next time I'm in the area I will probably eat here but call it in ahead for pickup this time. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family.",

I also ordered the seulong tang  and if youre korean you know that in it theres always  noodles but instead they had the rice noodles that always goes in like pho at vietnamese restaurants. Because of that the noodles were hard and it strayed away from the light and softness of the soup.... wtf did u run out of ingredients(?). The soup broth was good tho.  The only thing is despite how stressful it seemed the servers didnt express any anger or frustration which was refreshing. Oh and they gave us cold tea (Yasss cold  is bomb)   Theres alot of nonkoreans eating here and that just shows the food doesnt fit korean taste----   Wouldnt come again, sorry",

This is my go-to place because they offer a variety of dishes so whatever Korean dish I'm craving, I can find it here. What I always get: Kimchi fried rice, kimchi soft tofu stew with beef, sul lung tang (I call it well-being soup because it makes me feel better when I'm sick), and kalbi. Kalbi and the other bbq's here are so expensive! But I don't know AZ prices....I only know LA prices where these dishes are so much cheaper. But the kalbi marinade they use did taste really good and came out sizzling on an iron plate over onions. Order the tofu soup spicy - it really isn't spicy and more like medium. When you need service, raise your hand and look at the server because that is more customary for traditional Korean restaurants (actually Koreans raise their hands and yell out \"here\" in Korean..haha). I need to try the rest of the menu but I always get the same stuff because I know what I like and I crave it!",

Not everything they make is that great, but every single one of their signature BBQ dishes are amazing. New Times magazine, the Arizona Republic, and Phoenix magazine all rave about this place, and I must admit that I rave about it to people. The food is just so good, and the portions are so BIG even Adam Richmond would need a to-go box.  Now I'm no expert, but this place seems really authentic. I've been to a number of Korean restaurants in southern Cali, and this place is one of the most \"Korean\" that I've been to. Being on Dobson, it's right in the heart of the Asian community of Mesa. Smartly, they're not just another Asian food joint a mile up by Mekong palace and they're located right by MCC and the hospital right off both the US60 and the 101. Easily in contention for the best Korean in the Phoenix valley, Hodori is a must try for anyone in the metro area.",

I was greeted and seated promptly.     After a short wait I ordered a Heit (beer) and the Kalbi (shortribs).  I  found it a bit pricy at 19.95 for the kalbi but I  had enough for 2 people  including the dishes they serve to accompany your entree. So that lessened the sting a bit. The kalbi came sizzling on a bed of onions. Well marinaded and very tasty.  I couldn't get enough of the kimchi or the dakon or that tofu or the potatoes....yum it was all quite good.   As it is next to one of my favorite places to pick up a boba drink (The Street) there is no doubt I will be here again.  Maybe during Happy Hour when they offer food and drink specials.",

I dream about their kimchi-anything (rice and jjigae), and their soon dubu is some of THE best.  Obviously, though, since they specialize in soft tofu soups, hehe.    The service is great, super friendly, and they check on us regularly throughout the meal.  I always leave with a smile on my face and my tummy~.  Anyone who loves Korean food should come here!!!!!    P.S.  Let it be known, that if I ever need to be in a hospital, I hope it's Banner, since it's literally across the street from Hodori!  Haha!  P.S.S. As an avid fan of kpop, I enjoy that they play music off of band's albums that aren't just the promoted singles~.",

The restaurant itself is pleasant and casual with no music (yeah!).  My only complaint were the utensils.  We were given very thin metal chopsticks and a spoon.  The thin metal chopsticks were hard to hold and metal of course is slippery.    The service was friendly and reasonably attentive.  We'll definitely be back!",

My typical favorites are kimchi jigae (spicy tofu/kimchi/pork soup), Haemul pajeon (seafood pancake), Galbi (short ribs), oh jing oh duk bokki (spicy squid with rice cakes), Bibimbap (rice bowl with veggies and bulgogi), mul mandu (dumplings)... I could go on and on.    If it's your first time with Korean food and you're not very adventurous, get the Galbi and JapChae noodles or Bibimbap (but be sure to try the side dishes (called panchan).  If you're in for the adventure and heat... see my list above! :)  Hope and dread were the battling in me when I left CA and realized I'd have to find Korean food here in AZ.  Turned out to be a needless battle though as the Phoenix area continues to surprise me with their hidden and limited but delicious, authentic fare...  Yum yum Hodori!  This was my first taste of Phx area Korean food and I have to say, I was impressed!  It's much better than I expected it to be.  They have an extensive menu so I ordered Bibimbap, Kimchi jigae, and Galbi.  It was all good.  The panchan was tasty, too.  I still crave LA Korean food sometimes but this was definitely good enough to return to, many time.  See ya there!",

    "text": "Just before I was leaving for California after winter break, I decided to bring my family for Korean BBQ because they had never tried it before. I did not realize this was not the type of Korean BBQ with the grill in the center of the table and the marinated meat that we get to cook. Nonetheless, we ordered beef bulgogi, bibimbap, and some soups.  I think I must have ordered incorrectly. I went for the traditional beef bulgogi and wound up being very surprised that was served in a bowl of soup with glass noodles. I thought I was getting a skillet of grilled, marinated meat to share with my family.  The bibimbap came in a huge bowl (I like to order it hot), and here, I was a little disappointed again, because I thought it would have the black rice because that's how I've had it before. Instead, it was just the regular white rice we typically eat.  Soups were not that great as well. We ordered one with pork ribs, and the meat was not tender. The only vegetables in our soups were green onions, which we are not a big fan of (they're great to give flavor to a dish, but not as vegetables for a meal, I think). We didn't eat very much, and were not happy with the fact that each dish is $10-$13.  The restaurant is welcoming, but this meal just really wasn't what I expected.",

We topped off our meal with some pork barbeque, which was pretty good but not as yummy as my mama's.

The side dishes (banchan) were okay - the bean sprouts were excellent, but I didn't try the kimchi ('cause, hello, it was in my soup - kimchi overload = not a good night).

I had ordered a vegetarian soon tofu soup with everything in it (seaweed, mushrooms, and kimchee) and eveything else ordered was shared with my friend except the soup. Although my friend tasted the soup and thought it diddint taste fresh. Towards the end of dinner, around 9:15, I began to feel suddenly ill. I went to the bathroom and threw up violently and painfully. :( Went out, and went back to throw up. Struggled to walk out of there, I threw up multiple times on the way home. By midnight I was hyperventilating, in extreme pain everywhere, and could not walk. I called my friend who was just with me to take me to the emergency room. I considered calling an ambulence. :( I truly felt like I was going to die.  My friend found me on bathroom floor. Rushed me to hospital. In the hospital, I blacked out a few times, saw the light, as they rushed to attend to me. I couldn't talk, walk, or function. I had severe food poisoning.  I had chills, sweats, shakes, and feeling hot and cold. Absolute worst feeling in the world. They immediately gave me fluids, nausea meds, and morphine for pain. I was there untill 3:30. My feeling is that soup was bad. It diddnt taste right to begin with, nor did it look right. Also, considering it was a veggie broth, I wonder if because it may be something the Asians there NEVER order (perhaps), they probably had a batch that went wrong, or... maybe something else in the soup wasint right. Lastly, the soup is usually super boiling hot. I felt like it wasint, cause my egg diddint cook right away as usual. Maybe it was the egg from samonila poisening. I'm going to talk to the manager, I want a full refund.  This has been the most traumatic health issue I've ever felt, and certainly the worst case of food poisoning I have ever had. :(  Update: Sean the owner helped to get me a full refund. And I expressed that I would like to give this place another chance without getting sick. He also gave me a gift card for future use. Thank you Sean.",

Across the street from my go-to boba place (Boba Tree Lin Tea House), Hodori was pretty easy to find and at 7.30PM on a Saturday night, we were seated almost immediately. I'm no connoisseur of Korean food but there seemed to be a fair number of patrons who knew their Korean food in the restaurant so I knew I was in good hands.  Bibimbap was definitely in the books for that night and Yelp led me to their kimchi jun and soon tofu soup. I was on the fence on which Soon Tofu soup to go with and when I voiced this to my waiter, he very decisively said, 1 or 2 - which is the Hodori Special and seafood soon tofu soups, respectively. We went with 1. Also, might I add, I absolutely loved his recommendations, and how he conveyed them. Oftentimes, when I ask for recommendations, the response that comes back is, well people like to order this, and rarely do I get an actual recommendation. In his case, he definitely gave us his opinion, and very decisively so, which I appreciate. And his recommendations were definitely winners.  Personally, I loved the Hodori special soon tofu Soup and kimchi jun. Yes, even when it was 100 degrees outside, at night, yes, I was in love with their spicy soup that was still at a rolling boil when it got to our table. My husband made me get it at Regular heat (and I agreed, begrudgingly) but it was surprisingly, slightly spicier than I would've expected. I'd still take it up a notch and order something higher up on the spicy scale, if I had my way. The kimchi jun was delish. Think, crisp-ness of a quesadilla, but without the cheese, and mellowed out kimchi instead. Don't get me wrong, I love cheese, but I love me some kimchi pancake (i.e., kimchi jun). The bibimbap, I was just okay with (though the hubby loved it), but wound up devouring it cause I completely doused it in that amazing sweet and spicy sauce that they bring to your table (if anyone can tell me what that is, please, please, please tell me how to make it or where to find it. I need it in my life, on the reg). Oh and their ban chan? Top notch. The table next to us was just this one guy, devouring a bowl of Soon Tofu soup and had the ban chan all to himself. Not gonna lie, I was jealous cause he didn't have to share.  All in all, definitely hit the spot. I see seafood soon tofu soup in my near future.",

    "text": "One of my all time favorite Korean restaurants in this area would have to be @hodoriaz. This time, I shared an Army Stew with a few of my friends. It's a Korean fusion ramen stew cooked with processed American foods. This one was cooked with Spam, Sausages, Tofu, Enokitake, Ddeok, Pork Belly, Green Onions, and of course, Ramen Noodles. It was especially fun to eat because they served it in a giant pan on a portable gas stove. So, you get to cook it right in front of you! And one thing to note is it's pretty pricy ($27), but trust me, it can feed at least 2 people at the table. I even shared it amongst 2 other friends (so, 3 of us total). Not only that, but this particular dish comes with 2 bowls of rice and all their complimentary side dishes. There's no way you won't be satisfied after eating all that. And if you'd like to order more, I'd recommend the Hot Stone Bibimbap or the Kimchi Bokkumbap. They make it exceptionally great here",

    "text": "When I went to this restaurant, it wasn't too busy. I ended up trying the jap chae and the tofu soup. There was a lot of jap chae. This is basically the clear noodles that are sometimes called glass noodles because they are clear. The jap chae also had the usual carrots and green onions. The tofu soup was ok. I felt that the flavor was a bit bland.  I really liked some of the sides. For the ban chan, they had fish cake slices, bean sprouts, cucumber, bok choy, kimchee, and red potato. I liked the fish cake slices, bok choy, kimchee, and the red potato. It is rare for me to see fish cake, but maybe I don't go to enough restaurants that have it. I would think it would be more prevalent than it appears to be. I also think red potato tends to be softer than the russet brown potatoes.",

Japchae was hot and fresh even I had to have some. Bulgogi had that smoky flavor.   Banchan was tasty and flavorful. Endless as usual!!!   Yook-gae-jang hit the spot for me. It was hearty with all the goodies.   Got there just before dinner rush and service was spot on.   You won't be disappointed!!!!",

Way to make my taste buds scream with excitement.   It's a great place for business meetings. Thanks for accepting my invite to lunch Jason Wiseman!

It's not the traditional AYCE and you cook you're own meat, but they do give a nice portion of what you order.   We always go with the bulgogi which is cooked with onions that absorbs the flavor of the meat. Very good taste which I think could use just a little bit more depth but still very good. I always order the kimchi Jiigae which I feel they have the best version of this soup. It's full of pork belly, kimchi, and tofu and the flavors are amazing. One of my favorite dishes to order!  On top of that, all the ban Chan sides are awesome! I can't get enough of kimchi cucumbers. I can eat those all day! Check this place out for awesome Korean!",

For the past several years, we went around the town, from the west valley to the east valley, trying Korean restaurants. Some we like and some are just ok. When we can back to Hodori again, we could tell that this place is legit.   The food are exceptional good. I enjoy my all time favorite soon tofu soup with seafood and beef. I got the spicy one. The raw egg putting in the soup at the table is better than putting it in the kitchen or on the stove top. This created perfectly soft boiled egg to enjoy with spicy soup broth.  They are always generous with ban chan. At the end of the meal, we got to enjoy a tiny bottle of probiotics drink.",

Our server NEVER came by not sure if it was because it was just the two of us or if because we were Korean but never bothered to check on us. Even just once would've sufficed. But no. I had to ask two different servers for napkins and while everyone else got their bill when they  asked. Someone just dropped ours off at the table while we were still eating .. lollll",

Might win over their really good bulgogi.  The banchan, little Korean side dishes, were exceptional, with a couple I had never tried before. I especially love the Kim Chee, the Kim chee style cucumber pickles, the bean sprout salad and the fish cake. All of the sides are really good. The potato in a sweet syrup helps cleanse the palate between bites. The seaweed salad was good also. Heck they all were  Service was unbelievably good!! They don't even blink when your banchan start to run low. They just HAPPILY get you more. In fact they run over and ask, not that uncomfortable moment you get in some places.  Portions are generous for the price.  It's weird, they hit all the buttons for  a 5 star.   I think when it gets cooler and I try one of the stews that I see all the Koreans ordering, I will get over this invisible hill.  Fantastic place to eat!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were looking for a traditional Korean restaurant in the east valley when we stumbled upon this place. Went in on a Friday night and the place was about half full of customers. We were shortly waived over to a table and ordered our drinks a few minutes later. After looking at the menu we saw that the prices were a little steep so we figured either the portions were huge or the quality would be out of this world. Well.... we got neither. Both my boyfriend and I love bulgogi so I ordered the bulgogi hot pot and he ordered the traditional bulgogi.   Food got to us fairly quickly and we saw that the portion size was lacking. When we tasted the dishes the flavor was very mediocre. Not bad, just kinda blah. The meet was mostly fat and not very tender as bulgogi should be. The flavor was too sweet and not enough spice to it. As for the side dishes that come with the meal they were all just as bland and boring. Most Korean restaurants bring tons of little things to try but here there were only 5.  All in all the service was good but the food left us unsatisfied.",

    "text": "Omg so good! We went for my fiance's birthday, and I used the leftovers to make fried rice for lunch today. It was awesome. We went last night right before 6 thinking we would make it before the dinner rush. Turns out Koreans eat early and we got there DURING the rush! We didn't have to wait very long to be seated but it took forever to order, get our food, pay the bill, etc. They only had three ladies waitressing, running the register, and so on. Our water glasses were never filled. Well at least the food was good.   The Bulgogi had great flavor and was very tender. The entree was pricey (normal for ribeye to expensive at KBBQ places) but they gave us a huge portion so we ate it last night and today too. The Soon tofu was delicious and packed with tofu, kimchee, tender cubes of beef and seaweed. We asked for medium spicy and it was quite spicy! We can handle spice but for those who can't, I recommend you get it as mild as possible. Definitely loved the soup, I will be back for this one! Lastly the seafood pancake was packed with baby shrimp, octopus, scallion, and mushrooms. It was good but got soggy pretty quickly unfortunately. But when served hot in crispy its yummy dipped into the tangy sauce they serve with it. Banchan was unimpressive and limited, the potato side dish was too sweet (I think they put syrup on it) and the kimchee was just okay. I prefer the seafood pancake and banchan at Cafe Ga Hyang more . Overall we were very satisfied with the meat and soon tofu and will be back if we're in the area!  Minus a star for the lacking banchan and slow service.",

I felt like it was \"comfort food\" even though I've never had it before.  it not only tastes amazing, but the texture of the silky tofu feels really good on your tongue. That sounds kinda weird but that's how I feel.    Husband got bulgogi which was good and I also got the spicy octopus.  Some pieces were cooked perfectly and others were a little chewy.    It was pretty expensive, but I think this is a place that's best to come with a big group of people and share the food as the portions are big.  There were several large groups there.  I feel like we could've had 4 people share what we ordered if we got another side and then it would've been a good deal.  I will definitely be back for more soup and to try some of their kimchi pancakes and their bowls with egg on top which look delicious.  This is one of my new favorite places for sure",

So I compromise in the service and price department. Plus the food has always been a hit or miss.  The only constant thing I have enjoyed is the Kimchi Pancakes. Overall, a gamble on good Korean food is better than no Korean food ..... I guess. But today in the bibimbap we found HAIR. I really wish this place had great service and good quality food I could count on. When the food is good, its good! But sadly due to the service, the hair, and the high price I may not be returning again.",

    "text": "Korean restaurants are all varied, ranging from the ones where you cook your own food, to those where they cook the food in the kitchen and bring it to you. Hodori is of the later type.  We were a group of about 12, and were seated in a room away from the main stream area. As it turned out, this was good, since our group was a bit noisy.  One of the dishes ordered was Korean soup. This is brought out boiling in a bowl, with a raw egg dropped into it at the last minute to cook in the broth. Satisfying and wonderful in flavor. Another of our party ordered Bibim Bap. A dish that is cooked in a red hot stone bowl consisting of rice, veggies and meat, with a sauce that you add to your taste. Again, this was an excellent dish.  The Bulgogi and Galbi are excellent even though they are cooked in the kitchen. An assortment of condiments including some excellent kimchi (homemade perhaps) was served with it.  My only complaint is that each time I have come here I have ordered an Obi beer, and each time, they tell me they are sold out.  Oh well, if this is the only problem, then they are doing well.  At the risk of sounding prejudiced (which I am not), I noticed the most of the patrons of the restaurant were Korean. This tells me that the food is authentic and appeals to those who know real Korean food.  Service was reasonably fast, and the place was nicely clean.  4 stars",

    "text": "My wife and I went here with another couple last night.  All of us are very white and very non-Korean so I was concerned about the service we would receive after reading a few reviews on Yelp.  I was actually pleasantly surprised with the service.  Our waiter was very friendly and fast and answered any questions with a smile.  It was about 7pm on a Wednesday night and the place wasn't too crowded.  There were probably 15 other people in the place who were all of Asian decent so you know the place is the real deal.  The ambiance is a bit cafeteria-like but it didn't matter because I was there for a new culinary experience as this was my first time eating Korean food.  Now about the food....  After they take your drink and food orders, your table is given 6 or 7 small appetizers.  I don't remember what everything was but I do remember the kimchi.  I've never had it before but I know it is a Korean dining staple so I gave it a shot.  I was not a fan of it and probably won't ever have it again, but it was interesting to say the least.  Here is what we ordered:  * Mushroom Soon Tofu soup with beef - the soup is what this place seems to be known for judging by the Yelp reviews so I had to order it.  The bowl came out boiling hot which was good because we opted for the raw egg to be cracked and put into it right before it was served.  The soft tofu was a bit different to me but the soup had good flavor and a nice kick.  I would order it again but I'd like to try other ingredients such as prawns, etc.  * Short ribs - this is secretly why I wanted to come here.  I was told they were awesome and they were.  The marinate\\sauce was not overpowering and they were very tender.  I will for sure order these again.  * BBQ chicken - not the leanest or best cut of chicken but it was very good and flavorful.  Again, the sauce\\marinade was not too strong.  * Octopus in spicy sauce - this was the \"crazy\" dish for me for the evening.  I enjoy fried calamari and squid/octopus salad, but larger chunks of squid or octopus scare me a little.  I mean they weren't real big chunks but big enough to where you see you are eating a bunch of those little suction cup thingys that octopi have.  Between that and the chewiness of each bite made my stomach turn a bit.  However, the dish had good flavor and a nice kick thanks to the red sauce they bathed it in.  I'm not sure I would order this again.  Anyway, I would definitely come back again.  I enjoyed the service and would like to try other tofu soups and some of the other meat dishes.  I really want to try the bbq ribeye and bbq pork dishes in addition to more of that chicken and those short ribs!",

    "text": "My family go to this place all the time, and today it really deserves a 2 star.  Every time we go there, we ask for more \"potato side dish\" when we finish it.  For the past 2 times, plus this time again, we ask them for more side dish, they would take the dish away and never come back.  We have to go ask the lady for the side dish that they took away.  Then they said they don't have any more of such such such and will give us kimchi instead.  Same thing for today.  We asked for more potato side dish, the lady took the dish away but never came back, for about 10 mins.  My 4 year old daughter really likes it and that's the only thing she will eat.  She was waiting for it but they did not bring it bck.  I told her to go ask the lady.  So she did.  The lady told her they have no more potato.    But they are constantly busy, bringing out food to other tables.  But every cart is full of those side dish and the potatoes were there.  Every table that they bring out.  So why did they tell us there is no more potato?  What???  Pissed me off.  We ordered the seafood pancake but the flour mix was not cooked all the way. Just a bad day today.",

If you're like me and prefer to grill at your table, it's kind of a bummer, but it's no biggie.  The servers are pretty attentive and are quick to refill your drinks, get you more side dishes (yes, you can ask for more kimchi, bean sprouts or what have you), etc.  The main reason why I come here is to have their ar sundubu (fish roe tofu soup).  There is nothing better after a great (or awful :P) night of drinking.  Ar sundubu w/ an egg on top (or substitute with another sundubu if you don't like fish roe) A bowl of rice Cold barley tea (boricha)  Nom nom nom.",

We always ordered spicy tofu + seafood soup, seafood pancake, bulgolgi beef and jap chae when we were there. The service is fast and good. Even though the price is a bit higher but it is worth the price. You won't be too disappointed with Hidori!",

A friend of us told us about Hodori, so we decided to give it a try. OMG, it was the worst dinning experience we had for a long time. First, bad service; you seat yourself and wait. The two waitresses were running like crazy. Good luck on getting their attention if you want your water refilled. The price is at least one third higher than Takantsu, but the potion is at least one third less. The seafood pancake had only a couple of tiny shrimps in it. My husband was stationed in Korea for years and knows Korean food very well. Koreans are known for garlic loving, but non of the dishes we ordered had garlic in them. That was a big surprise and a big disappointment also. With no drinks, one 4 inch seafood pancakes and  clear noodle (which they call appetizer) and one dish to share, our bill came over $40. Well, I guess before we find another Korean restaurant, if we really want Korean food, we just have to go back to Takamtsu again.",

Sometimes the service is slow, but overall the food is pretty good!! Their traditional Bulgogi (the one that comes with soup in it and glass noodles) is my go-to! Their army soup and bossam are also in point!",

The banchan were fairly standard, nothing mind blowing.  The best gauge is usually the kimchi and taste if their homemade recipe is as superior as other restaurants.    With two soon dobu one spicy and the other mild, the soup came out white.  When asked about the mild spice, the chef says the spice is there.  I couldn't taste or smell a hint of spiciness in that soup.  If you have white, mild, spicy and extra spicy, I would imagine the mild has some type of spice and color to the soup base.      Overall, it wasn't terrible, but given the neighborhood, maybe it's as good as it gets here.  I'm just a visitor passing through and giving my opinion of our visit here.",

Our group doubled in size from the start and our servers were more than accommodating.  I ordered 2 things at this restaurant for lunch.  I ordered the Haemul Pajeon (Seafood pancake) to start.  I ate a small piece of it and had it packaged to bring home for lunch/dinner the next day.  A very tasty pancake with lots of shrimp and squid in it, onions and other spices.  Similar to an okonomyaki that we frequently see in Japanese restaurants.  For my main portion of the meal, I had a bowl of the Kimchi chigae  (Kimchi soup)  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=piisc06BvMh6csRPY7RvHw&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>.  The yelpers that said this was a delicious dish were  not mistaken.  A very well seasoned and delicious bowl of soup that had nice chucks of pork in it and the veggies.  Fellow Yelper and ATW lunch groupie, Dawn K, said she really enjoyed the somewhat fatty meat in the soup.  I personally enjoyed the spiciness!  I would eat this again and I can't wait to have it again.  I wasn't very impressed with their banchan selection.  The side dishes just were not as tasty as I would have liked.",

Today we arrived and were shocked to see the menu prices. $17.99 for spicy pork?! Okay, I'll let it slide because of the tasty side dishes that accompany the entree. They usually serve some of our favorites and are greatly varied.   Except today... we received two weird seaweed dishes, two dishes both made from cucumber, sour kimchi and 4 small pieces of potatoes. Four.  Both of our dishes tasted less appetizing than usual. I ate a few bites of mine but the pork is so heavily marinated that it stands no chance at caramelizing, so the texture as a protein was very unappealing for me. It was almost slimy. It was nowhere near $18 of tasty.   Service is where I lost it. Water refills 15 minutes plus. When it's a 6oz glass of water, leave a pitcher damn.  As I said having enjoyed Hodori for five years; we have definitely lost loyalty to this restaurant. Our bill for two enjoying potsickers and two entrees was $47. Many Valley restaurants can accommodate a more appetizing menu and more welcoming service.",

I used to get good service there but now that there's a new group of employees, I try not to come by until I watch Korean drama and in need of Kimchi Chigae and Bulgogi.  I have been coming to this place for years and found it by accident because my favorite Korean restaurant went out of business.  For one of my group lunches, my friend suggest we go to Hodori. There were a group of us and I remember getting terrible service!!! We didn't leave a good tip as a result of that and the waitress actually chased us down.  Aren't tips earned?   I went back to Hodori because my friend said they're under new management, so I thought ok I'll give it another shot.  This time the service was wayyyyyyy better so I stay loyal to Hodori. I also discovered my love for Kimchi Chigae, which I thought is a simple dish of soup.  I tried looking for the recipe and duplicate it but failed every time.  So I guess I'm stuck with Kimchi Chigae.  No other restaurants make it like Hodori does.  What I would order here: Kimchi Chigae Bulgogi Kalbi  The lunch plates are quite good as well. Their side dishes used to be awesome.  They used to have these anchovies that were delish- but now the side dishes are something I don't look forward to anymore at this place.    I would come back only for the Kimchi Chigae.",

    "text": "My first impression of the place was pretty good. We walked in to friendly servers and lots of appetizing photos. The menu was a little messy but I appreciate the photos.   One of the best thing about going for Korean food is trying different types of kimchi. I was disappointed at the kimchi selection they serve. Only 2 were good (fish cake and pickled radish).   For my main course, I ordered their Kimchi Soon Tofu soup with pork. It was nothing out of ordinary and definitely not on my top 5 list of Soon Tofu. The tofu were in large chunks and there were barely any kimchi in the soup.  My boyfriend ordered their Daeji Bulgogi (Korean BBQ pork) and that was extremely disappointing. It feels like the one thing that can't go wrong in a Korean restaurant is BBQ but I was totally wrong. First of all, the dish took forever to be served. The pork was extremely stringy and oily. On the menu, it states that the BBQ dishes come with a lettuce plate but we did not get any.  As a lot had previously warned, the service is extremely bad. We tried to pay for our food and we were completely ignored by a server who felt that cleaning a table next to ours (while the restaurant was barely full) was more important than serving us.   My hunt for a nice Korean food in town continues. Definitely do not recommend this place if you have tried really good Korean food.",

Having worked at a few Asian restaurants, Chinese\\Korean first generation wait staff is generally speaking slower and less attentive than their western counterparts. A few years ago they served you after all the Korean people if you brought black or white friends with you. Sort of funny I guess and not a big deal as they eventually resolved that issue. However, I had to stop going because the older waitresses were consistently rude to my non-Korean guests. We weren't loud, and I tipped 20-25% every time we went there but it got annoying. Anyways, would be five stars but drop to 3 for hiring rude wait staff.",

    "text": "So we decided to try out Korean food in Arizona, and this place had the best reviews, it seemed. I ordered mul-neng-myun, while my husband ordered bi-bim-neng-myun. We received a decent amount of banchan, but the weirdest one was coleslaw. I have never seen coleslaw as banchan at a Korean restaurant before.  The barley tea was weak, but they iced it for the hot Phoenix evening, so it was refreshing. My husband enjoyed his bibimnengmyun, but he was disappointed that it wasn't as spicy as he expected it to be. Perhaps they reduced the spice level for Arizonans, or maybe they were from a region of Korea that eats milder food. My mul-neng-myun was very good. I had no complaints. It was what I expected.  The banchan was just OK. The kimchee wasn't as good as what I expect in California, but my husband liked the sliced tofu. The coleslaw was surprisingly good, but strange as banchan in a Korean restaurant. The soy-marinated potatoes and the radish kimchee was OK.  Service was excellent. Our server checked in on us several times and gave us coffee candy with our dinner check. I would rather have cut up fruit like watermelon or orange slices, but I'll take candy over the Korean gum that some Korean restaurants leave with the bill. This place looked almost as busy as the Hodori Restaurant in Koreatown (LA). No relationship to the Koreatown restaurant, though. Hodori is the name of the official mascot of the 1988 Seoul Olympics. The full name of the mascot is Hodori Horangi (Hodori, the Tiger).",

Whenever my friends from other places come visit me in Phoenix, I bring them here, and they all love this place!  We eat A LOT here so never really thought of writing a review (what logic is that?) and found that the quality is pretty consistent. I think I only encountered twice that weren't very good.  The spicy beef brisket soup is very nice too!!!! I've been lack of appetite lately (for over a week), not sure why, but when I ate this yesterday, I could eat the whole bowl (it was a large bowl too) and wanted more!! :D It's that delicious!

It was a very classy experience even though the place is sort of set up like a cafeteria.  My only complaint is that I wish they had more Bibimbap options. There were only two.

    "text": "I really love their nakji dol sot, which is their octopus dish. But the service sucks and they lie. You ask for another serving of banchan, they tell you they ran out. Then you see them serving it to others. What? If I'm desperate for that dish, I may go back..but I will avoid it if I can. I prefer takamatsu's service. SO MUCH better. They don't 'run out' of side dishes and actually offer to give you more. AND they don't nickel and dime you for extra rice for your kids.",

    "text": "I was craving tofu soup one night so I checked this place out based on all the positive reviews.  The tofu was soft and flavorful.  Several other tables ordered their BBQ meats, which also looked/smelled good.  The side dishes were OK but not as many options as other Korean restaurants I have been to.  They have the basics - kimchee, cucumber, radish, sprouts.  Overall, the food was better than I expected for a place in Phoenix.  Now to the bad: the service was absolutely atrocious, if you can call that service at all.  It is a sign of bad service when every table in the restaurant is looking around for someone to help them.  We waited 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and take our order.  Another 40 minutes for the food.  The side dishes come with the entrees so don't count on them when you are starving.  The tofu came without rice, which took another 10 minutes.  All this time, you have to flag the waiters multiple times if you want a refill of water or anything else.  Even when they make eye contact, they ignore you.  People actually left their tables to go to the service area and help themselves!  There were no apologies from the waiters for the wait.  They did not even smile.  The very worst part of the meal was paying.  Naturally, we were not able to get our checks at the table, so we lined up at the cashiers table behind another group.  (Keep in mind there is no cashier so we had to wait for a waiter to decide we were worth his time of day.)  When it came our turn to pay, the waiter blew right past us without help us!  Luckily, another waiter finally saw us and got us our check.  I wish we could have given him all the tip.  This may be the only Korean place in Phoenix, but I will hold out for when I go to LA.  Even if they have unfriendly service, at least they are efficient.",
